The European Space Agency's Sun-watching Proba-2 satellite has sent back incredible footage of three partial solar eclipses as seen from Earth's orbit. During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen from Australia on Tuesday night, the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, its alignment such that it appears large enough to block out the Sun's rays. Since Proba-2 orbits Earth about 14.5 times per day, it can dip in and out of the Moon’s shadow around the time of a solar eclipse. Black hole sun: One of the images of . Monday night's eclipse as seen by the European Space Agency's Proba-2 . satellite. The images taken by the satellite's SWAP imager, which snaps the . Sun in ultraviolet light . Won't you come: The UV images reveal stormy . active regions on the Sun's face, including sunspots, the roots of some . large solar flares and coronal mass ejections that are occasionally . directed towards Earth . And wash away the rain? Since Proba-2 orbits Earth . about 14.5 times per day, it can dip in and out of the Moon's shadow . around the time of a solar eclipse . The constant change in viewing angle of Proba-2 meant that the satellite passed through the shadow three times during Tuesday's eclipse. However, as the Sun was never completely covered up from Proba-2’s vantage point, each eclipse was only partial. The video was produced from images taken by Proba-2’s SWAP imager, which snaps the Sun in ultraviolet light revealing stormy active regions on the Sun’s face, including sunspots, the roots of some large solar flares and coronal mass ejections that are occasionally directed towards Earth. The apparent noise in the movie is caused by high energy particles hitting Proba-2's electronics as the spacecraft passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly. The dimming in the movie is an effect as part of the satellite's orbit passes through the shadow of the Earth. The Proba-2 satellite: The Sun-watching satellite only saw partial eclipses as the Sun was never completely covered up from its vantage point in the Earth's orbit . Joe Zender, Proba-2 mission manager, . said: 'The satellite also spent hours collecting data of the solar . environment further away from the Sun before and after the main eclipse . event, providing context for the ground-based observations.' From boats bobbing on the Great Barrier Reef to hot air balloons hovering over the rainforest, and the hilltops and beaches in between, tens of thousands of scientists, tourists and amateur astronomers watched in awe as the sun, moon and Earth aligned and plunged northern Australia into darkness. Forecasters were predicting cloudy skies around dawn Wednesday, but it didn't materialise, allowing stargazers to experience it unhindered. The eclipse began at 05.45 in the far north of the Australian state, with totality occurring at 06.38 on November 14 (20.38 GMT). 'Immediately before, I was thinking, ""Are we gonna see this?"" And we just had a fantastic display - it was just beautiful,' said Terry Cuttle of the Astronomical Association of Queensland, who has seen a dozen total solar eclipses over the years. 'And right after it finished, the clouds came back again. 'It really adds to the drama of it.' Observing in visible light extremely . close to the solar surface is only possible from the ground during . eclipses when the bright solar disc is temporarily obscured. This . briefly exposes the Sun’s bright atmosphere, or corona, and the red glow . of the chromosphere. 'Combining visible light observations with the extreme ultraviolet images from Proba-2 gives us a unique opportunity to access difficult-to-see regions of the Sun at different wavelengths, during a rare event such as a total solar eclipse,' Mr Zender added. Observers on the ground watched in awe as darkness swept across the land for a little over 2 minutes. The eclipse began at 05.45 in the far north of Queensland, with totality occurring at 06.38 on November 14 (20.38 on November 13 in GMT). Proba-2 scientist Anik De Groof watched the event with thousands of others along the Australian coast at Palm Cove. 'We got all a bit nervous when after sunrise the partially eclipsed Sun was covered by a big cloud, but 5 minutes before totality, the cloud dissolved and we could watch ""Baily’s beads"" form – the effect where beads of sunlight shine through the rugged lunar landscape,' said Mr De Groof. 'At totality we could see the red chromosphere and the corona in the most beautiful conditions – it was fantastic!' Dramatic: Near totality is seen during the solar eclipse at Palm Cove, Australia, where thousands of eclipse-watchers gathered to view the phenomenon, the first in Australia in a decade . Australians will have another chance to see a solar eclipse in May 2013, although because the Moon will be slightly further away from the Earth, it won’t block the whole Sun, resulting in an ‘annular eclipse’. Europe will have to wait until November 2013 before the opportunity arises to see a partial solar eclipse across much of the south. Meanwhile, ESA’s fleet of Sun-watching spacecraft will continue to monitor the Sun’s stormy behaviour as it unleashes its plasma load out into space and towards Earth. Scientists will get even closer to the action in 2017 with the launch of Solar Orbiter, which will travel to observe the Sun from a daring distance of just 26million miles - that's inside the orbit of planet Mercury, our system's innermost planet.","The ESA's Proba-2 satellite dipped in and out of the Moon's shadow three times during Monday night's eclipse .

Tragic: Schoolgirl Lindsey Inger, 13, died after being hit by a tram at a notoriously dangerous crossing in Nottingham . A teenage girl died after being hit by a tram at a level crossing - four years after a woman and her grandson were killed at the same spot. Lindsey Inger, 13, was rushed to hospital following the accident in Hucknall, Nottingham, last night but later died from her injuries. The tram driver and her devastated friends were also treated for shock. Police have launched an investigation to establish what happened, but campaigners say the crossing is notoriously dangerous and should be closed. School dinner lady Jean Hoggart, 56, and . her seven-year-old grandson Mikey Dawson were killed when they were hit . by a train at the same crossing in November 2008. Lindsey's friend Paige Layton  said the group of friends had been walking home to Paige's home in Bestwood Village when the accident happened. She said they did not see or hear the tram approach on the dark crossing. 'We were all crossing and I was holding Lindsey’s hand and the tram just came and took her and she went flying,' the 13-year-old said tearfully. Paige’s mother, Tara, added: 'This area is not secure enough. They were not messing about, or anything. They were just four friends, walking to my house, hand-in-hand. 'Accidents have happened here before . and I’m surprised nothing has been done. Why does it have to take . another life for someone to do anything? 'This shouldn’t be a walkway if no-one is going to make it secure.' Accident: Lindsey Inger's friend Paige Layton said the group of friends did not hear or see the tram approaching in the darkness last night . Notorious: Local residents say the crossing in Hucknall, Nottingham, has been an accident black spot for years. A woman and her grandson died at the same spot in November 2008 . Yesterday tributes flooded into a Facebook page set up in the Year 9 pupil’s memory. Friend Kaine Richards, wrote: 'R.I.P . beautiful. Gone but never forgotten baby fly high up there hope your . looking down on everyone. Everyone's missing you and thinking of you.' Another pal said: 'R.I.P Lindsey for . ever in our hearts !! Going to miss Your hugs so much !! most of all I’m . going to miss you so much R.I.P princess.' In a statement issued by Ellis . Guildford School and Sports College, where Lindsey was a student, . headteacher Sally Coulton said: 'Staff and pupils at the school deeply . shocked by Lindsey’s death and are struggling to come to terms with what . has happened. 'Our thoughts and sympathies are with her friends and family at this sad time.' The crossing, which is in two sections . and includes separate tram and train tracks running parallel to each . other with an ‘island’ in between them, has hand gates and warning . signs. A new gate and warning signs were installed after Mrs Hoggart and Mikey were killed. Mrs Hoggart’s widower, Laurence, . received an undisclosed payout from Network Rail earlier this year after . it accepted responsibility following the deaths. A report into the 2008 tragedy by . RAIB concluded: 'The risk to pedestrians presented by tram operations . running parallel to the Network Rail line was not considered by any . party. Tributes: Friends left heartfelt messages on a Facebook page set up in memory of the Year 9 pupil . 'There was no appreciation that . crossings in darkness present different risks to pedestrians compared . with during daylight hours.' But at the time of Mr Hoggart’s . payout, local councillor Chris Baron said: 'Network Rail has made quite a lot of alterations . to the crossing but I still think it vital that the gate should lock . automatically when a train is approaching.' The crossing is administered by Network Rail and tram operator NET (Nottingham Express Transit) who are helping police with their inquiries. Local councillors, residents and . an MP - as well as Lindsey’s friends - said it Is dangerous and should . be closed. Hucknall councillor Mr . Baron said: 'This girl had her whole . life ahead of her. This is the third fatality in four years, and there . have been other incidents too. 'We need gates that lock . automatically when a train or tram is coming, and warning lights that . flash so that pedestrians can get across in safety. Up to 200 people use . it daily, and it is a very dark crossing. 'Network Rail and NET need to put . their heads together. I do not know the ins and outs of this tragedy, . but something is obviously not right. 'It is time it was sorted, before we have another one. The easiest solution would be to close it completely.' Local resident Daniel Hall, 27, said: 'It’s disgusting. It has been a death-trap for years. The fact there . are trams and trains travelling in the same direction at different . speeds confuses people. There have been plans for a bridge for ages, but . nothing has been done.” Mark Spencer, the MP for Sherwood, said: 'There is clearly a problem at this . point, because there have been a number of accidents and we need to . separate trams from pedestrians here. The best way to do that would be . with a bridge.' Lindsey’s friends have now started a petition to have automatically locking gates installed at the crossing. General manager of NET Neil Wood said: 'Our . thoughts and sympathy are with the teenager’s family at this time. We . have launched our own internal inquiry into the incident.'

Tragedy: A grieving widower (not pictured) killed himself after burglars stole his late wife's treasured possessions while he was in hospital recovering from a stroke (image posed by model) A grieving widower killed himself after burglars stole his late wife's treasured possessions while he was in hospital recovering from a stroke. Heartbroken Bob Baker, 75, gassed himself in the same bed . where his wife had died just months earlier after struggling to cope following the break-in. The grandfather-of-two . left a heartbreaking note for his family, which read: 'After the break-in I just don't feel comfortable in the house anymore, and am always listening for any noise. 'Sorry I have to end my life this way but I cannot see any other way. So please forgive me.' Mr Baker had lost his beloved wife Helen to cancer just days after she was diagnosed with the disease. Overcome with grief, his health deteriorated dramatically and he was rushed to hospital by ambulance after suffering a stroke. As the devastated pensioner lay in hospital, callous burglars ransacked the couple's family home, stealing his lost love's irreplaceable jewellery. Former Army man Mr Baker was distraught when he came home to find his wife's smashed jewellery box and its sentimental contents gone. The ordeal robbed him of precious reminders of his wife of 39 years. And it left the fitness fanatic so scared that he started sleeping with a knife by his bed, had CCTV cameras fitted and gave up his daily exercise because he felt frightened to leave his home. Distressed daughter Jo, who wept . inconsolably as her father's last tragic moments were recounted at an . inquest, says the theft transformed him. She and partner Mark Willis . discovered her father dead in his bed after letting themselves into his . house when he didn't return their phone calls. The couple - who never got the chance . to tell Mr Baker they are expecting their first baby - also found the . gut-wrenching suicide note, in the lounge. Mr Willis, speaking on Jo's behalf, said: 'I think the burglary was the tipping point. 'He used to enjoy going for walks each morning but after the burglary, and not feeling safe, these walks stopped. Son-in-law Mark Willis . 'He was full of fear for what might . happen whilst he was away. We want the sort of people who commit these . crimes to understand what a devastating impact it can have on people's . lives.' Mr Baker, from Southampton, went to his GP following the burglary, uncovered on May 11. Dr Abdul Hafeez said in a report that . Mr Baker - previously a former bus inspector and a school chef - was . 'very unsettled' after losing his wife. He added: 'He was very upset about the break in of his property when articles of extreme emotional value were stolen.' Mr Baker died of gas inhalation, Southampton Coroners Court heard. Coroner Keith Wiseman said: 'There is no doubt the break-in caused Mr Baker significant concern. 'It is important to take the opportunity to publicise the devastating effect that break-ins have on people. 'The effects on elderly people are . considerable and I fear are never regarded by these people who . persistently commit these offences. 'This may well have been the final straw as far as Mr Baker was concerned.' Mr and Mrs Baker, a lollipop lady of 27 years, had dedicated their retirement to helping others. Intrepid Mr Baker, who had worked as an assessor for the Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme, ran seven marathons to raise money for charity. The former bus inspector and school chef kept up spinning classes in his 70s and even completed a 10 mile race on his 70th birthday. Detective Sergeant Matt Taylor, who was called to the scene on July 29, noted how there were photos of Mrs Baker in every room. Police are still investigating the burglary and have pledged to bring the perpetrators to justice. A man arrested in connection with the break-in was released without charge. DS Matt Taylor said: 'Burglary is a despicable crime and this inquest shows the devastating and far-reaching impact it can have. 'It is an abhorrent act to invade somebody's home and life to steal items. 'Although on the face of it they may be of relatively low value, to the victim they are sentimental and irreplaceable. 'There are some people who think it is acceptable to commit this sort of crime but it will not be tolerated.' The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.","Bob Baker killed himself in same bed where wife died months earlier .

"PUBLISHED: . 04:59 EST, 10 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:00 EST, 10 November 2012 . Britain's highest court is to debate whether soldiers in battle have the right to life, has been claimed. The Supreme Court will investigate circumstances surrounding the death of Private Phillip Hewett in Iraq in July 2005 and examine whether troops in war zones are covered by the part of the European Convention on Human Rights that protects the right to life, The Independent said. Private Hewett's mother Sue Smith has fought for justice since the 21-year-old was blown up along with two colleagues from the Staffordshire Regiment in a roadside bomb attack on their armoured Snatch Land Rover. Ongoing battle: Pte Hewett, one of the three soldiers from the Staffordshire regiment killed on patrol in Iraq. His mother, Sue Smith, has taken her case to the Supreme Court . In October the lower Court of Appeal ruled that relatives of soldiers who had been killed in action could pursue claims on grounds of negligence - but not make claims for damages under human rights legislation. The judges accepted the Government's . assertion that the battlefield was beyond the reach of litigation but . the families' lawyers said the fight would go on and they would take the . human rights battle to the Supreme Court. Determined: Sue Smith, Pte Hewett's mother, said it was 'disgusting' that Iraqi citizens were afforded rights that British soldiers were not . Ms Smith, 51, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, said outside the court: 'It is just so dismissive. It 'doesn't matter'. They are Action Men. If you break them, just bury them. But they are not just Action Men. People need to make a stand.' Currently servicemen and women on bases in Afghanistan are covered by human-rights law, but this protection dissipates as soon as they walk out of the gates. But, last year the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled that Iraqi citizens killed when the UK was effectively the occupying force in southern Iraq were protected by the European convention. Speaking to The Independent, Ms Smith's solicitor Jocelyn Cockburn, said the law protected Iraqi citizens better than British soldiers. 'It is anomalous that, as the law currently stands, soldiers are capable of bringing others within UK jurisdiction but they are not within it themselves. 'We afford Iraqi citizens rights of protection which we cannot even give to our own soldiers.' She said she hoped the Strasbourg ruling would strengthen Ms Smith's argument before the Supreme Court which is believed to take place before seven judges in February. Ms Smith, a community care worker, . has accused the Ministry of Defence of breaching its duty of care by . making British troops use the poorly protected Snatch vehicles in Iraq. She . told The Independent: 'Sometimes I feel the Government is in control of . everything and that I am fighting a system that everybody works for. It . is nice to know I might have a chance. Sombre: soldiers carrying Pte Hewett's coffin after it was flown in to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire . Attacked: (L-R) Second Lieutenant Richard Shearer and Pte Leon Spicer, also from the Staffordshire regiment, were killed alongside Pte Hewett in the roadside bomb attack . 'I find it disgusting that we employ soldiers to defend our country and send them out without any human rights, yet we criticise other countries for not honouring their human rights.' John Wadham, general counsel for the Equality and Human Rights Commission, told The Independent that the section of the ECHR in question, Article 2, did not offer absolute protection but simply placed a responsibility on the state to protect life in the context of the situation.","Seven-year struggle of mother of a 21-year-old soldier killed in Iraq reaches Supreme Court .

"By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 12:36 EST, 20 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:36 EST, 20 November 2012 . A 'dangerous' paedophile who was jailed after he was caught watching girls at a swimming pool a day after he was released by the Court of Appeal has today been freed once more - by the same court. David John Filor, 31, walked free in April after appeal judges said his potentially lifelong sentence for child porn crimes was unlawful. Within 24 hours he was spotted by police watching children play in the swimming pool at Newport leisure centre. 'Dangerous': Filor was jailed for 30 months in August after being caught watching girls at Newport Leisure Centre, pictured, thereby breeching his sexual offences prevention order . He admitted breaching a court order banning him from loitering near places likely to attract children and was jailed for 30 moths at Cardiff Crown Court in August. However, today he was released again after three senior judges at the Court of Appeal in London said the prison sentence was 'excessive'. Mr Justice Males, sitting with Lord . Justice Laws and Mr Justice Griffith Williams, cut the sentence to eight . months, allowing immediate release. The judge said that, although there . was a risk his offending might escalate in future, a sentence 'out of . all proportion' with what he actually did could not be justified. Filor, of Argoed, Blackwood in Gwent, was initially jailed in January 2011 after admitting possessing child and extreme pornography. He was found with a cache of 430 images of child sex abuse, 78 of which were at the most depraved level as categorised by police. The images included some of surgical procedures being carried out on children’s bodies and photos of bestiality, the Court of Appeal heard in April. Filor was found to be a 'dangerous' offender, the court in April heard, after he confessed to 'fantasising' about sexual attacks on children. He was given an open-ended imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence last year, designed to keep him behind bars until considered safe for release. '...while the risk of future offending is a . factor, it cannot justify a sentence which is out of all proportion to . what the appellant has done.' The Court of Appeal in April ruled the sentence was 'unlawful' because he must be punished for what he did and not what he might do in the future. The following day he visited the leisure centre despite being banned by a sexual offences prevention order. Filor was followed and monitored by 17 police surveillance officers. On CCTV footage, he can be seen paying particular attention to a girl of about nine as she walks past and watching a children’s swimming pool through a window. Giving the judgment today, Mr Justice Males said Filor had a 'long-standing and disturbing' sexual interest in young girls, but had not been in trouble for contact offences. The judge who sentenced him had been influenced by a pre-sentence report suggesting that Filor was 'extremely dangerous', based on other allegations. Appeal: Judges at the Court of Appeal, which sit at the Royal Courts of Justice, pictured, in London, said the sentence was 'excessive' But he had not been prosecuted for those allegations and did not accept them to be true, meaning he should not have been sentenced on the basis of them, Mr Justice Males said. He added: '[Filor] must be sentenced for the offence to which he has pleaded guilty and, while the risk of future offending is a factor, it cannot justify a sentence which is out of all proportion to what the appellant has done. 'In this case, what the appellant has done is relatively modest. It was a single occasion. It didn’t involve contact with any child. 'It occurred in a public place where the children were accompanied by their parents and were under supervision. 'We have no doubt that the sentence passed in this case was excessive.' The sentence was reduced to eight months, but due to 124 days already spent in custody, Filor was eligible for immediate release.","David John Filor, 31, was jailed for 30 months in August for breeching his sexual offences prevention order .

There are many foods that you might think of as quintessentially French: baguettes, snails, a slice or two of fromage, garlic, onions and of course frogs’ legs. But when it comes to choosing drinks that sum up the Gallic experience, there is only one contender: a large glass of vino. But in reality, the French are falling out of love with their most famous tipple, official figures show. Popularity plunge: Consumption levels of wine in France are at their lowest ever levels, according to research by the French Ministry of Agriculture . Fewer than one in five French adults – 17 per cent – now drink a glass of wine every day, the statistics from  France’s ministry of agriculture reveal. Caroline Plot, the official who oversaw the research, said the trend owed much to increasing awareness of the perceived health dangers associated with regular consumption of alcohol – particularly liver disease – along with the nation’s economic troubles. ‘There has also been a real shift in consumption habits: fizzy drinks and fruit juices are taking the place of wine on the French table,’ she added. Stricter drink-driving laws have also put many off having a few glasses of wine after work, as would have been normal in the past. In 1980, wine would be served at, on average, one meal in two. By 2010 that had fallen to one in four. The number of teetotallers in France – a group which includes former president Nicolas Sarkozy – has now reached 38 per cent, the figures show. The findings reflect a long-term trend that has seen France’s average wine consumption fall from 160 litres per adult per year in 1965 to 57 litres in 2010 – equivalent to a drop from three glasses to one glass per person per day. Wine Consumption graph.jpg . But French consumption of wine still . outstrips that of their British counterparts, who drink 28 litres per . person each year, roughly equivalent to three glasses a week. Study co-author Philippe Janvier said: . ‘Alcohol in general and wine in particular have become a weekend thing, . to be consumed in a convivial or celebratory setting.’ France is the world’s second largest . wine producer, with only Italy ahead, and produces between 7billion and . 8billion bottles a year. The French are traditionally the . biggest consumers of their own wines but the downward consumer trend has . left wine producers relying increasingly on foreign markets. However, demand for wine has also been falling in many of those other markets. The result has been a wine glut, often . called the wine lake, which has led to the distillation of wine into . industrial alcohol as well as a government programme to pay French . farmers to pull up their grape vines. The market for champagne as well as . the demand for the expensive ranked or classified wines has been . relatively unscathed by the drinking downturn but these constitute only . about 5 per cent of French production.","Study by French Ministry of Agriculture reveals major fall in consumption .

Young children are the biggest texters in Britain, sending an average of 193 text messages a week - double the number they sent last year, telecom regulator Ofcom has revealed. The figure for boys and girls aged between 12 and 15 is nearly four times the UK average of 50 texts a week. Girls are more enthusiastic texters than boys, according to the survey from Ofcom. Young children are the biggest texters in Britain, sending an average of 193 text messages a week -with 12 to 15 year old girls topping the table . For the first time, Ofcom has researched the media habits of 3-4 year . olds. One in ten (9%) 3-4 year olds use a tablet at home, according to their . parents. Over a third (37%) are going . online using a desktop PC, laptop or netbook. This is possibly to do . activities such as look at a website, watch a TV programme or play games . online, Ofcom believes. Girls between 12 and 15 send more than 30 texts a day - 35 per cent more than boys in the same age group - and some older girls send an average of 221 messages a week. But younger children are also sending far more texts than last year, researchers found. The average child aged between eight and 11 sends 41 texts a week - double the number sent in 2011, when the figure was 23. The report discovered there has been an explosion in the use of tablet computers among children of all ages. Researchers found that the number of children aged between five and 15 using tablets has tripled since last year. Fourteen per cent of all children now use a tablet at home. More are also using the internet. Youngsters between 12 and 15 are for the first time spending as much time on the net - often accessed through their mobile phone - as they spend watching TV. This adds up to 17 hours a week on each. Claudio Pollack, Ofcom’s consumer group director, said: 'Our latest research shows that children’s take-up and use of different media is growing at a rapid pace, with some areas such as texting and smartphone ownership fast outstripping the general population. 'However, children are not just using more media. They are also adopting some forms at a very young age. 'This highlights the challenge that some parents face in keeping up with their children when it comes to technology and in understanding what they can do to protect children.' The number of children in the 12 to 15 age bracket who own a smartphone has increased by 50 per cent since last year. Now nearly two-thirds of children in this age group have one - up 41 per cent compared with last year. This is far higher than the UK average for adults of 45 per cent. A brother, aged 4, and sister, aged 1, play with an iPad and iPhone. Researchers today said that one in ten 3-5 year olds use a tablet. Mobile phones are the most vital device for them - even more important than TV. Two-thirds say they would miss their mobile phone most - up from a quarter last year. Younger children say they would miss TV the most. The average child aged between five and 15 watches TV for an estimated 16 hours a week. Older children, aged between 12 and 15, spend most time watching it - 17.3 hours a week. Since 2007, there has been a decline in the number of children watching TV in their bedrooms. The number of children aged between five and seven watching in bedrooms has fallen from 52 per cent to 43 per cent; the number of children aged between eight and 11 watching in bedrooms has fallen from 69 per cent to 58 per cent; and the number of children aged between 12 and 15 watching in bedrooms has fallen from 81 per cent to 73 per cent.","Ofcom report also finds 12-15 year olds are spending as much time on the internet as they do watching TV .

Victim: Cold Spring police officer Tom Decker, pictured, was shot twice and killed on Thursday in what authorities are calling an ambush killing . A Minnesota police officer and father-of-four has been shot dead, allegedly by the suicidal man he'd been called out to assist. Tom Decker, 31, of Cold Spring Police, arrived at the home of Ryan Larson, 34, around 11pm on Thursday to check on his welfare after receiving a call from his concerned family. But while he was getting out of his squad car, the officer was ambushed and, despite wearing a bulletproof vest, died at the scene. Police said several guns were found at the scene and Mr Larson had been taken into custody on suspicion of second degree murder. The county attorney's office was considering criminal charges. 'It's apparent to us the officer was ambushed at the scene,' said Drew Evans, assistant superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Investigators wouldn't elaborate on why they believe the shooting was an ambush, saying only that the shooting was still being investigated. Stearns County Sheriff John Sanner . said his department got a call around 9pm reportedly from Mr Larson's . family, saying he might be suicidal. Cold Spring police went to his home once and couldn't raise anyone, then returned almost two hours later. It was during the second trip that Mr Decker was shot. Investigation: Police officers searched for clues at the scene where Mr Decker was fatally shot late on Thursday . Ambushed: Tom Decker was responding to a report of a suicidal man when he was ambushed . On Friday, residents of Cold Spring, a city with a population of about 4,000 located 75 miles northwest of Minneapolis, were mourning the loss of the brave six-year veteran officer. 'He was a policeman trying to help . someone. He was called there to help and he went there and was shot . doing his job,' said Donna Knaus, a manager at Cold Spring Bakery not . far from the crime scene. 'It's horrible.' Florence Benson, 72, of Rockville, just a few miles down the road, added: 'It's a terrible, terrible thing in a community this size. Just about everybody knows everybody - especially police officers.' The officer grew up on a farm south of town, and after graduating from college, worked at several small Minnesota police departments before coming home for what he called his dream job. Killing: Cold Spring police officer Tom Decker, pictured right, was shot twice and killed on Thursday in what authorities are calling an ambush killing by Ryan Larson, left . Mr Decker leaves behind a wife and four children from a previous marriage - two daughters ages 8 and 7, and two sons ages 6 and 5. One woman who said she didn't know the officer left a flower bouquet for his family at City Hall, where a heart-shaped balloon and candle were also left. A banner made at a local school was filled with dozens of colorful handprints cut out of construction paper and read: 'We thank all of you for your service to our community.' When asked about the banner, Cold Spring Mayor Doug Schmitz was moved to tears. 'It's tough,' he whispered. 'A lot of people woke up this morning in shock, and we're still in shock,' he said later. 'We're a strong community. We just bind together here. It's going to be a tough few days and weeks to come, but we'll make it.' Blocks surrounding the crime scene were cordoned off with police tape on Friday, and officers - some using dogs, others searching rooftops - canvassed the area. Heartbreak: With close family friend Tom Johnson by her side, Rosella Decker, mother of slain Cold Spring police officer Tom Decker, talks about what a great father her son was . Family in mourning: Tom Decker's sister Shelly, brother Eddie, father John and mother Rosella remember their brother and son in the kitchen of their family farm . Several guns were found, according to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, but the agency was searching for additional weapons that may be related to Mr Decker's death. Brian Moen, who lives about a block from the bar, said officers who came to his door told him they were looking for a sawed-off shotgun. Cold Spring Police Chief Phil Jones said Mr Decker was the 'department jokester' on a force with only eight full-time officers. Mr Decker served as the department's instructor on firearms and use of force. Mr Jones said he never had problems with Mr Decker, noting he'd received repeated letters of commendation and appreciation. His younger brother, Joe Decker, said his sibling loved to travel and be outdoors. He said Tom Decker was shy and reserved as a youngster but became outgoing and gregarious as an adult. 'He was one of those people who'd be the life of the party,' Joe Decker said. Shocked: Police and sheriff department members consoled each other as they looked in on the hearse carrying the body of fallen police officer Tom Decker on Friday . Tragic: Mr Decker as a six-year veteran of the police force and father of four . Police attention had been drawn before to Mr Larson, a machine tool student at St. Cloud Technical and Community College, though mostly for traffic-related offenses but once in an abuse case. In 2009, he reached a plea agreement to settle a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge for engaging in behavior that could 'arouse alarm, anger, or resentment in others.' As part of the plea deal, he served a day in jail and agreed to undergo domestic abuse counseling. A no-contact order was issued. Court files indicated he violated his probation in 2010. 'He's a normal person,' Jeff Scoles Jr., a friend of Mr Larson's, told the AP late on Friday. 'He's not a monster.' Hearse: Police and sheriff department members gather at Wenners Funeral home with the hearse carrying Tom Decker . Procession: Police and sheriff vehicles followed behind the hearse carrying the body of their comrade . Mr Scoles said his friend lived in an apartment above his bar and has filled in as a bartender at another bar he owns. Mr Scoles added that Mr Larson was doing his homework at one of the bars on Thursday and was in a 'good mood' when he left that afternoon. He added that Mr Larson took a concealed-carry class in January and that Mr Larson owned guns, but 'was cautious with them.' Condolences for Decker came from fellow police officers in other Minnesota departments and from elected officials, including Gov. Mark Dayton. 'On behalf of the people of Minnesota, I extend my deepest sympathies to his family and to the Cold Springs Police Department for their tragic loss of an outstanding officer, father and friend,' the governor said.","Tom Decker, 31, of Cold Spring Police, was shot twice while getting out of his cop car on Thursday night .

Locked up: Kenneth Mark Shirley 42, who has been handed another 16 life sentences on top of the seven he is already serving . A convicted murderer and rapist was told by a judge today that he will probably die in prison after being convicted of another knifepoint sex attack. Mr Justice Astill handed Kenneth Mark Shirley another 16 life sentences on top of the seven he is already serving. Shirley, 42, was found guilty of four rapes, 12 assaults by penetration and a single charge of wounding which took place between December 7 and 12, 2005, by a jury at Bristol Crown Court. Shirley, 42, tied the woman to her bed, . gagged her and repeatedly degraded with a knife and other objects during . a 12-hour assault. The woman was left so traumatised by the attack in December 2005 that she did not tell police until last year. Shirley, who is known by his middle name . of Mark, is already serving life imprisonment for the near-identical . sex attack on Bristol woman Helen Stockford in 2009. She gave up her anonymity in 2009, when he was convicted of raping her. He was only free walking the streets . because he had been released on licence from prison in 2003 after . serving 16 years of a life sentence for the ritualistic murder of Mary . Wainwright, 67, in Cardiff in 1987. Jurors at Bristol Crown Court took around six hours to find Shirley unanimously guilty. The judge said: 'Kenneth Mark Shirley, you must appreciate that the nature of these offences, and the murder and rape convictions that went before them, may well result - and probably should result - in you remaining in custody for the remainder of your life.' Shirley, who was surrounded by four dock officers, showed no emotion and stared straight ahead as the jury foreman returned all 17 verdicts. The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, sat in the upstairs public gallery of court room two to see the verdicts returned. Sitting just a few feet away was Mrs Stockford, who has been present in the public gallery for the whole trial. During Shirley’s trial at Bristol Crown Court, jurors were told of 'peculiar hallmarks' of his behaviour, which linked the murder and the 2009 rape to the offences for which he has now been convicted. Prosecutors say it was 'beyond the realms of coincidence that a different man could have committed such similar offences in such a distinctive way'. Scene: Shirley was told at Bristol Crown Court that he would probably die behind bars . William Mousley QC told the court that the woman was the victim of a 'brutal and prolonged sexual attack' at the hands of Shirley. 'She was repeatedly raped and otherwise violently assaulted over a period of hours whilst being held as a prisoner in her own home,' the prosecutor said. 'Many of the incidents occurred at knifepoint or when she had been tied up.' Mr Mousley said the attack was 'devastating' for the woman and she has been forced to give up her career and admitted to a psychiatric unit. Three weeks before the attack, the woman and her housemate had been out drinking in the Waterfront area of Bristol when they met a man called Mark. The two women and the man chatted and the housemate told Mark that she would be away at a Christmas party for a few days in early December. The alleged victim described in detail to Mark where she lived but the conversation turned sour later and she told him to 'f*** off' before leaving. On the night of the attack, the woman heard a white van pull up outside her house. Justice: Helen Stockford who has campaigned for the man who brutally raped her to spend the rest of his life behind bars has said justice has now been done after he was told he will probably die in jail . She then heard footsteps and suddenly a well-built man in a black balaclava came in through an unlocked door. 'He pushed her backwards and she fell over on the kitchen floor. He knelt over her and banged her head against the tiled floor,' Mr Mousley said. 'He then grabbed her and dragged her backwards in the direction of the corridor saying ‘You can’t say no now’. 'He let go of her and seemed to be looking around the house. He then dragged her into the bedroom, having gone past the bathroom, swearing and menacing ‘You aint gonna say f****** no, you f****** bitch’ and ‘Wake up... you are going to be awake for this’.' Mr Mousley said the woman tried to fight the man off but he pinned her down on the bedroom floor. He then told her to get up and pushed her on to the bed. The attacker removed his mask and as the woman remembered him from the pub three weeks earlier, he said: 'You recognise me now then... You’re going to suffer now.' The man took regular breaks between assaults to make cups of tea or watch television. Shirley said to her: 'I’m going to drink your blood and then you’ll always be inside me.' Mr Mousley told jurors: 'He threatened to cut off her toe, finger or ear, saying he had chopped up a woman before. 'He traced the knife down her front and said he had taken someone’s eye out before. He told her that he would kill her slowly...' Mr Mousley explained that similarities between these allegations and Shirley’s previous convictions meant the victim was not making it up. 'The prosecution say that these previous convictions and their relative timing demonstrate a clear pattern of repeated behaviour,' he said. The woman first confided in a psychologist and finally gave a written statement to police in May 2011. She later picked Shirley out at an identity parade. In a defence statement, Shirley, who was living in Bristol, denied ever meeting the woman or raping her. 'He has suggested that she has imagined the attack as a result of her deteriorating health,' Mr Mousley said. Heavily-tattooed Shirley offered no evidence as a defence to the allegations.","Kenneth Mark Shirley was on licence after serving 16 years of life sentence for 'ritualistic' murder in 1987 .

The 61-year-old ambassador brought the woman to his $1.2million home in Englewood, New Jersey from the Philippines after arranging a visa. She cleaned, did laundry and took care of the dog for 12 hours a day for the equivalent of $3.57 - far below minimum wage of $7.25. Prestigious role: Somduth Soborun, pictured speaking on behalf of Mauritius at the UN, has been fined in a Newark court for paying his Filipino housekeeper the equivalent of $3.57 an hour . Soborun, who earns up to $200,000, organized a visa for the woman, who has only been identified by the initials CV. She was employed from December 2008 until August 2009. Police and FBI were informed of CV's treatment leading to an investigation into her pay and working conditions. U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman told the New York Post: 'Although Soborun signed a contract that provided for an hourly wage as well as for overtime pay for any hours exceeding 40 per week, Soborun only paid C.V. $1,000 per month, regardless of how many hours she worked each month.' He will be allowed to keep his job as ambassador for Mauritius, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean. Plea deal: Mr Soborun leaves court with his lawyer on Monday after being forced to pay $24,000 restitution to his housekeeper, allowing him to keep his job . In his role as ambassador, Mr Soborun is responsible for his Mauritius' interests in the U.S. along with protecting and offering advice to Mauritians abroad. Calls to the Embassy of Mauritius in Washington D.C. and the ambassador's lawyer Nicholas Doria were not returned to MailOnline. Regardless of visa status, foreign workers have the right to be paid $7.25 an hour in the U.S. Overtime - which constitutes anything more than 40 hours a week - should be one and a half time's minimum wage.

A lesbian woman who was allegedly beaten by her girlfriend's brother is defending her attacker and saying the assault was not a hate crime. Mallory Owens, age 23, was attacked while eating Thanksgiving dinner with girlfriend Alex Hawkins' family in Mobile, Alabama on Thursday. Miss Owens' mother initially said that Travis Hawkins beat her because she disapproved of her sister's gay relationship. However, Miss Owens contends that was not the case. Scroll down for video . Victim: Mallory Owens, left, was left horribly injured after attending Thanksgiving dinner with girlfriend Alex Hawkins, right . Aftermath: Mallory Owens, right, returned to the home of her girlfriend, Alex Hawkins, left, after she was brutally beaten there days earlier . 'A lot of things have happened between us, but it doesn't make me hate her brother,' she told WKRG-TV on Tuesday. 'I don't hate her family at all, or anybody for that matter.' Miss Owens, who was unconscious days after the attack, woke up on Tuesday and checked herself out of the hospital. And she returned to her girlfriend's home - the same place where she was savagely beaten. Miss Owens asked for her face, which is still horrifically mangled from the beating, not to be shown on camera on Tuesday. 'It's not a hate crime at all,' Miss . Hawkins said. 'We both know the reason why this happened, and it doesn't . make any excuses for him, I'm not defending him at all. I know why he . was angry, and that will come out.' Neither woman elaborated about the 'real' reason behind the beating. Brutality: Miss Owens was hospitalized for . several days after the attack, receiving treatment for a broken nose in . the beating that was so bad her eyes were swollen shut . Happy couple: Owens and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner . Hawkins was arrested on Sunday and charged with second-degree assault, and later released on bond. Family and supporters of Miss Owens believe those charges should be much more severe. A . Facebook group entitled 'Charge Travis Hawkins Jr with the attempted . murder of Mallory Owens' has sprung up on Facebook, garnering more than 4,600 'likes' since it was formed. Hawkins' lawyer, James Byrd, told the . TV station his client, age 18, has been forced to go into hiding after . numerous death threats. 'People have taken this and overreacted, and made it something that it's not,' Mr Byrd said. Miss Owens' mother, Kristi Taylor initially told the TV station that Travis Hawkins allegedly beat her daughter because he disapproved of her gay relationship. The accused: Travis Hawkins was charged with second-degree assault in the attack, and was later released on bond . 'He tried to kill her. He's lucky he didn't kill her. She's lucky to be . alive. I didn't recognize her when I got here. It's hard to look at her . like that.' Miss Owens was hospitalized and . treated for a broken nose and numerous lacerations. Her eyes were . swollen shut after the brutal beating and she had to receive facial . reconstruction surgery. Ms . Taylor said that there was friction with the Hawkins family over the . fact that her daughter was gay and had a relationship with the sister, . which Hawkins reportedly did not approve of. Despite the accusations, Hawkins . cannot be charged with a hate crime because Alabama law doesn't include . sexual orientation among bias offenses, according to the . Anti-Defamation League. Unrecognizable: Miss Owens suffered numerous lacerations and required facial reconstruction surgery after the attack . And Alabama is not alone, as 26 other . states are also without hate crime laws protecting members of the LGBT . community, including Texas, Virginia and Missouri. Earlier this year, Hawkins allegedly . hit Miss Owens over the head with a pipe wrench. While she was injured . in that attack, no charges were filed. While Mallory Owens' attacker has been charged in the vicious beating, friends and family of the woman are shocked that additional charges have not been filed. But despite the nature of the alleged beating, Travis Hawkins cannot be charged with a hate crime in Alabama. The state's law does not include sexual orientation among bias offenses, according to the Anti-Defamation League. And Alabama is not alone, as 26 other states are also without hate crime laws protecting members of the LGBT community. In 2010, the FBI reported 1,470 offenses based on sexual orientation bias in Alabama. Her mother told the station: 'I did not . want her to go, I begged her not to go, knowing how the family felt . about her. But she said, ""They're trying to be nice.""' Miss Owens' sister Avery Godwin told AL.com that Hawkins called her on Friday to say 'that he would finish what he started last night with Mallory.' Information about an attorney for Hawkins was not immediately available. It’s also not the first time that police have been called to the Hawkins home.

Homosexuality, punished with jail terms in the Soviet Union, was decriminalized in Russia in 1993, but much of the gay community remains underground as prejudice runs deep.

'She (Madonna) had been warned with . words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it.

Having spent more than £3,000 on a romantic holiday to Mexico, Gemma Fish and her fiancé were devastated by the ‘prison cell’ room they were given. But far worse was to come. A month after Miss Fish complained to tour operator Thomson, she was sent abusive emails telling her to ‘shut the **** up’ and book with Thomas Cook instead. The couple’s ordeal at the hands of Britain’s biggest package holiday firm started within minutes of them checking into their hotel in the resort of Catalonia Riviera Maya. Verbally abused: Holidaymaker Gemma Fish, received foul-mouthed emails from Thomson's after she complained to the tour operator about being given a 'prison cell' room on their holiday which they had spent more than £3,000 on . The holiday had been planned as a joint Valentine’s Day and birthday celebration for Gemma, 29, and her fiancé Andrew Bracchi. ‘When I arrived at my hotel, the room looked nothing at all like what was advertised on the Thomson website and not what I had expected given the price I paid,’ said Miss Fish. She had paid extra for a premier room, but found that the decoration was spartan with chipped floor tiles, two beds, a desk and a TV. ‘Quite frankly it was more like a prison cell than what you would expect after paying £3,000 for a holiday. It was just horrendous. I was appalled that they could do this to us,’ she said. Devastated by room: Miss Fish's ordeal started within minutes of them checking into their hotel in the resort of Catalonia Riviera Maya (pictured) She immediately contacted Thomson . through its 24-hour ‘holidayline’ telephone service. Her complaints were . acted upon and the couple were moved to a better room, although other . niggles remained about the noise, poor food and the beach. A month after returning home to Fuengirola on Spain’s Costa Del Sol, she received a series of abusive emails, suggesting she stop moaning and use rivals Thomas Cook in future. The first, apparently from a woman member of the customer service team, read: ‘Gemma do u really think we give a ****? Because we dont so shut the **** up with ur moaning and book with Thomas Cook coz we dont want ur custom lol and the hotel have said u r one MOANING bitch’. The couple travelled to Mexico in the second half of February.  Miss Fish told BBC’s Watchdog Daily programme that she was shocked by the emails, saying: ‘I don’t swear myself, so I was absolutely gobsmacked that they were even able to get through the system with that language in. It was just awful, and after everything we’d been through on the holiday, it was just the final bit for us really. It wasn’t nice at all.’ Blames angry employee: Thomson acted upon Miss Fish's room complaint but a month later she received the abusive emails which Thomson blamed on a disgruntled employee who 'interfered with a number of internal email accounts' Thomson has blamed a disgruntled employee for sending the abusive emails. A spokesman said: ‘Thomson would like to apologise to Ms Fish for the unacceptable emails she received. ‘An employee interfered with a number of internal email accounts, sending inappropriate emails. ‘We carried out a full internal investigation, as well as supporting the police in their investigation, the issue was dealt with immediately and the staff member was dismissed.’ Initially, the company offered the couple an apology and some holiday vouchers. This was then improved to a cheque for £100 and then £150 – but Miss Fish insists that this is still unsatisfactory. The spokesman said: ‘We would like to reassure our customers that the interference of these email accounts was an isolated incident. Customer service is of paramount importance to Thomson.’","Gemma Fish spent more than £3,000 on a holiday to Mexico with her fiance .

Pervert: Salem Al-Majali had no less than 200 videos filmed up women's skirts in his home in Battersea, South London . A man who preyed on women in supermarkets and stations to film up their skirts have been banned from owning any kind of recording device. Salem Al-Majali, 52, may have gathered seedy footage of 1,000 women as at least 200 recordings of unsuspecting women were found in his south London home. Engineer Al-Majali was caught filming up the skirts of two women in Victoria Station with cameras hidden in a rucksack. After his arrest, Al-Majali confessed to police he had preyed on hundreds of women during the last two years and that he bought cameras and camcorders specifically to make the perverted recordings. ‘It is evident the only reason he acquired the recording equipment was solely to record these footages’, prosecutor Michael Phillips told Westminster Magistrates Court. ‘He committed multiple offences over a long period of time, it was very elaborate and well organised, and having looked at the video equipment at his home, there were no less than 200 recordings.’ Al-Majali held his head in his hands throughout the court hearing as details of his sordid activities were revealed. Police believe the upskirt video clips found on several cameras and camcorders at his south London home were shot of women in every corner of capital. ‘There were numerous images and footage of a similar nature that he had filmed at supermarkets, train stations, and other public places’, said Mr Phillips. ‘They ladies involved would certainly be very alarmed, distressed, and embarrassed if they found out what had happened.’ Al-Majali's filthy scheme was . disrupted on July 21 this year when a security guard noticed him . behaving suspiciously in Marks & Spencer in Victoria Station. ‘The security guard recognised the defendant as he had often seen him entering the shop’, said Mr Phillips. Station perv: He was caught filming up female shoppers' skirts in a Marks & Spencer at Victoria Station . ‘He observed Mr Al-Majali appearing to take an interest in females, walking up very close to them. ‘He was spending much of the time by the sandwich section. ‘When they bent down to pick up an item from the freezer, Mr Al-Majali, who had a bag with him, constantly appeared to be adjusting the bag. ‘Particularly when the female customer bent down, he was seen to fiddle with the bag.’ After Al-Majali had been seen filming up the skirts of two women, the security guard followed him and called in police. Ban: Mr Al-Majali is not allowed to own any kind of recording device - including a phone with a camera - after appearing at Westminster Magistrates Court today . Officers found two mini-cameras and a camcorder hidden inside his bag with upskirt footage on it. ‘One of the females had been filmed three times’, Mr Phillips added. District Judge Nicholas Evans deferred sentencing for a report on Al-Majali and possible psychiatric tests, but warned him he is facing jail. ‘I can indicate today that the court is considering custody’, he said. Prosecutors indicated they will seek an Anti-social Behavioural Order after sentencing banning Al-Majali from carrying any kind of recording device with him, including any mobile phone with a camera. Al-Majali, of Battersea, south London, pleaded guilty today to one count of committing an act of outraging public decency, and was released on bail on the condition he does not use the Tube except to come to court, and does not carry recording devices with him.

Outspoken: London Mayor Boris Johnson sparked a row by criticising Google over its tax contributions . London Mayor Boris Johnson has said that not paying enough corporation tax has left internet giant Google with a PR headache. Mr Johnson said that by paying more tax the biggest multinational companies would be showing 'a greater commitment to society'. The mayor sparked a row with the company after he singled it out for criticism in a speech to businessmen last week where he said it was 'absurd' that large corporations are getting away with minimal tax contributions while poorly paid workers are forced to pay increasingly higher levies. And his comments were met with a fierce rebuke from the company's vice president Matt Britten who hit out at Johnson for not doing enough to support technology companies. He also attacked the mayor for 'not getting his facts right' by claiming Google paid ""zero"" tax when it paid £6 million on UK sales of £2.5 billion. The row comes as Mr Johnson continues a six day tour of India which is aimed at boosting trade links with London and the UK. Apart from Bangalore, Hyderabad is the emerging silicon valley of India and Mr Johnson specifically visited the city to promote stronger links between it and London's expanding high-tech industry. But the outspoken mayor stood by his initial criticisms, claiming Google had a PR problem. He said: 'My point is very simple: we all need Google, we all love Google. But here's the thing, it seems to me the point stands. 'You either change your tax arrangements or, as I have repeatedly said, great corporations that live and work and profit from the society that they are in should do a little bit more. Rebuke: Google vice president Matt Britten attacked Mr Johnson for not doing enough to support technology firms . 'People don't have to change. It's perfectly correct that the law as it stands can be used in that way. 'They have got a PR problem and the way to address that, because people feel a company like Google makes shed-loads of money, is by showing a greater commitment to society.' The spat started when Mr Johnson spoke to members of the Confederation of British Industry last week. He said then: 'We should have taxes that are low but fair and it is absurd to be suddenly whacking up taxes on cash-poor people who happen to inhabit expensive houses in London when firms like Google are paying zero. On tour: The row comes a Mr Johnson is in India on a tour aimed at improving trade links with London and the UK. He is pictured here with members of the England cricket team whom he met on the tour . 'Neither arrangement strikes me as being fair and so Google and co face a very clear choice - they can either change their tax arrangements or do much more to serve our society by visibly taking on 18 to 24-year-olds who are out of work.' But speaking to Channel 4 News last night, Mr Britten said the mayor should look at the 'broader contribution' made by Google to the economy, which included the support of start-up companies. He added: 'It's frustrating that the mayor of London, who is a great champion of the financial services industry, isn't championing the technology sector, which has the chance to provide the next wave of growth for London and the UK.'","The London Mayor has started a row over tax with Google after he said big companies should be making a 'greater contribution to society' through bigger payments .

With their reputation for being perfectly preened, primped and poised at all times, it’s no wonder French women tend to intimidate the British. But according to one, the Gallic approach to life can be learned – just as long as you’re not too bothered about being punctual. Géraldine Lepère is determined to dispel the myth that Frenchwomen are perfect and to teach British expatriates how to avoid embarrassment in social situations across the Channel. She has written a book called Comme . une Française – Like a Frenchwoman – which was inspired by her own . experiences of struggling to fit in during two years living and working . in Leeds. Miss Lepère . realised that many Brits are daunted by the formidable reputation of . the French, especially after a torrent of publications – with titles . such as French Women Don’t Get Fat and French Children Don’t Throw Food – . telling them how their continental counterparts do things better. But Miss Lepère, 27, from Grenoble, . said: ‘Our reputation is such that [British women] get the impression . they’re doing it all wrong. ‘We daunt them, so I break down the clichés and explain without taboos our codes – ones we don’t even know we have.’ Arriving on time for dinner in France, for example, is a cardinal sin. ‘You British are so punctual, but in France if you arrive bang on time you are likely to be met by someone without make-up and an uncooked dinner,’ Miss Lepère warned. She said she always tells her foreign friends to be 15 to 20 minutes late, but no more as this would be ‘impolite’. The non-initiated should also brush up on current affairs as the French love to debate, she added. British . women – and those from America – are also advised to learn to take . compliments in their stride, and make sure they do not interpret them as . a come-on or even as sexual harassment. Secret goose lover: It is fine to say 'no thanks' to foie gras, just make sure you keep schtum about your reasons why - it is considered very rude to do so as a protest against the treatment of the geese . ‘How many foreign married women are . thunderstruck to hear their French friend’s husband tell them “You look . ravishing this evening”?’ she asked. ‘We ﬂirt all the time. ‘If . a man in the street tells you “You are very pretty mademoiselle”, this . doesn’t mean he wants to sleep with you, it just means he thinks you are . attractive so he tells you. ‘My advice is say “Thank you”, take it as a free pick-me-up, like a sunny day.’ Miss Lepère found said she found people to be very ‘warm and open’ during her time in Britain – but admitted she was perplexed by conversations that revolved around TV and popular culture, and shocked to see colleagues go out wearing miniskirts in subzero temperatures and drink her under the table.

This is the story of how I woke Monday to find myself the target of at least ten thousand angry Justin Bieber fans. The story begins less than 24 hours earlier on Sunday afternoon, when I wrote an article about the online backlash ignited by the 18-year-old pop sensation's overalls, which he wore while accepting an award from Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The outfit, along with his backwards cap and neon yellow shoes, ignited outrage on the Internet over whether his outfit was an appropriate presentation for a meeting with the prime minister. Backlash: Justin Bieber's choice of wardrobe at a national ceremony with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper sparked outrage online . Bieber had earlier tweeted a photo of his outfit and wrote, 'I hope you hate my style.' Critics said it was disrespectful. Supporters said it was Bieber being Bieber and that he could wear whatever he wanted. Trend-setter? Bieber tweeted, 'I hope you hate my outfit' The Associated Press reported that he 'caused a scene' with the outfit, while Gawker.com gave him the moniker 'white trash prince' and The Atlantic called him a 'twit.' On Monday morning I had just jumped in the shower before work when the bathroom door flung open and in marched my boyfriend, who announced that my name was 'all over the Internet' in reference to Justin Bieber. He stuck his iPhone through the shower curtain and showed me the texts he had received from friends overnight as well as a Bieber fan page devoted to trashing my name. I shrugged and finished showering. Then a few minutes later, curiosity got the best of me and I flipped open my laptop to Google 'Hayley Peterson and Justin Bieber.' My jaw dropped at what I found. My Twitter account and inbox were littered with threats from strangers, most of whom called me vile names that the Daily Mail won't let me repeat in print. 'You need to think about what you say, b****,' wrote @kidrauhl. 'F*** you,' wrote @_JmLove_. 'Watch out,' wrote another Twitter user. Others said: 'What a c word,' 'come . online d*****bag,' 'how do you feel about that article now f****t,' and . 'prepare for the hate you asked for.' I didn't know whether to laugh or lock my door. It turns out Justin Bieber had responded directly to the article I wrote in a post on Instagram, prompting his fans to  track me down online and come at me with pitchforks raised. Response: My Twitter account and inbox were littered with threats from strangers, most of whom called me vile names that the Daily Mail won't let me repeat in print . Outrage: 'You need to think about what you say, b****,' wrote @kidrauhl. 'F*** you,' wrote @_JmLove_. 'Watch out,' wrote another Twitter user . In Bieber's response to my article, he . said the photo of him accepting the award from Harper was taken in an . arena where he would be performing. 'I walked straight from my meet and greet to [the prime minister], if you ""Hayley"" expect me to have a change of clothes let a loan a suit at that specific time that’s crazy,' he wrote. 'Wow am i ever white trash hayley peterson lol.' It was Gawker that branded him 'white trash prince,' but that was lost in the fray and not worth clarifying. I had been thrust to the center of the dispute over the appropriateness of Bieber's overalls, whether I liked it or not. By mid-noon Monday, the strongly-worded . threats from Bieber's fans continued to multiply. While the messages . came from seemingly harmless user names such as 'NOTICE ME BIEBER!!!' and 'Bieber's Girlfriend,' the vitriol from some still caught me off . guard.

'Wow am i ever white trash hayley peterson lol' Before I started working for MailOnline last month, I spent a couple years in Washington as a White House correspondent and presidential campaign reporter. I thought I had grown a pretty thick skin in that job. But nothing I did prepared me for an angry band of so-called 'Bieber Beliebers.' Perhaps most surprising, however, is that no article I wrote about President Obama or Mitt Romney ever garnered half as much attention as Justin Bieber's overalls.","Bieber ignites criticism online for overalls he wore to meeting with Canadian prime minister .

Victim: Blonde presenter Alex Lovell was stalked by James Connolly after he appeared on Channel 5's Brain Teaser game show . A quiz show contestant who stalked the programme's presenter has been barred from harassing her on Facebook and Twitter. James Connolly, 50, had been banned from contacting BBC newsreader Alex Lovell in December 2007 after bombarding her with emails, but had applied to have the ban lifted at Bristol Magistrates Court. Instead judges imposed a stricter ban on Connolly which prevents him using social media sites to contact her. Connolly told the court he only started contacting Alex, 39, when he received 'numerous anonymous prank phone calls' after appearing on Channel 5's Brain Teaser quiz show in 2004. He believed they were from the blonde presenter and then repeatedly emailed her for three years until she obtained an indefinite restraining order. Connolly, of Nottingham, said: 'As what I was receiving was anonymous, what I gave back was sometimes anonymous. 'When the original harassment case was brought against me I pleaded guilty because I was sorry that I had upset her.' He told the court that the ban was causing him problems explaining: 'I want to go to America to visit my cousin, but with the restraining order being against a celebrity, and connected to the BBC, I don't think the American authorities would look at me in a kind light. 'I believe that my passport has some kind of marker on it - I go to see my mum and dad in Ireland from Holyhead and my car always gets searched. 'I know that I will still have a criminal record but this restraining order is known to police as an 'active court order' and seems to mean they stop me more. 'I feel like the order is a Sword of Damocles hanging over me.' Alex - who became a presenter on BBC Points West in 2005 - prepared a victim impact statement saying that she wanted the order kept in place, because it was clearly working. Host: Alex Lovell pictured presenting Brain Teaser . Prosecutor Chris Holland said: 'She believes the order hanging over him prevents him from contacting her because of the serious repercussions. 'The ""Sword of Damocles"", as Connolly calls it, prevents him from making further contact with her. 'She makes the point that if this order was removed it would involve significant unpleasant and difficult security arrangements having to be put in place.' Mr Holland said the original order - imposed in December 2007 - was 'antiquated'. He asked magistrates to reimpose the restraining order but update it to include social media like Twitter and Facebook. Magistrates agreed and imposed the updated order indefinitely.

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian has sparked anger in the Middle East as she touches down in the region for a store launch and publicity tour. Kardashian, the curvy beauty who shot to prominence after an infamous sex tape of her emerged in 2007, is in Kuwait and will also visit Bahrain to launch a pair of Millions of Milkshakes franchises in malls. But the deeply conservative and religious nations may not offer her a warm welcome because of controversies surrounding the x-rated video, her short-lived marriage to NBA star Kris Humphries and a recent furore over her tweets supporting the people of Israel during the recent conflict with Palestine. Controversy: Kim Kardashian posed as she arrived in Kuwait today and will visit Bahrain this weekend. However, many in the conservative Gulf nations are angry at the controversial star's presence . 'Her values clash with our traditions as a religiously committed people,' Mohammad Al Tabtabai, a Kuwaiti preacher, told the Gulf News. 'Her visit could help spread vice among our youth.' In neighbouring Bahrain, conservative lawmakers blasted the reality TV star and tried to keep her out of the island nation, arguing that she is 'an actress with an extremely bad reputation'. However, their attempt fizzled out after they could not get the support they needed from their peers and the proposal did not even get to the voting stage. Sahar Moussa, a columnist for The Kuwait Times, was angry that a number of musicians and other artists have been denied entry on moral and religious concerns by the country's Islamist Party, but Kardashian is allowed to visit. Diplomacy: Kim Kardashian Meeting with the US Ambassador to Kuwait, Matthew Tueller . Glamorous: Kardashian flew from Florida's Fort Lauderdale airport. A Kuwaiti cleric said her visit would 'spread vice' among the youth of the Muslim nation . She said: 'Let me be clear here, I really hate judging people, and I do respect everybody’s business when it comes to their private life, but when it is someone like Kim Kardashian - who is only known for her obscene movie, voluptuous derriere and fake reality TV show that shows nothing but low morals and a lot of plastic surgery - then I have a problem. 'I will not forgive them for letting a person who has nothing except low morals and fake attitude to come to Kuwait and spread what message?' There is also some anger about the high prices of tickets to see her during her visit to Manama, Bahrain's capital. Tickets to see her in person can cost as much as 500 Bahraini dinar (more than £800), more than many Bahrainis earn in a month. Apology: Kardashian's message to fans after she tweeted her support for the people of Israel during the recent conflict with Palestine . University student Mahmood Zeyad told the Gulf Daily News: 'I am annoyed by the thought that our society can be this shallow because Kim is coming to Bahrain. 'It proves that there are some of us who would pay that much for nothing, in comparison with what that money could bring. 'A total of BD500 can save lives,' he added. However the celeb, who is currently dating rapper Kanye West, tweeted: 'It’s my first trip to Kuwait, so I can’t wait to see your beautiful city and meet everyone at The Avenues for Millions of Milkshakes on November 29.' For her Bahraini fans she posted a video, where she said: 'Fans in the Kingdom of Bahrain, it's Kim Kardashian and I am so excited to see your beautiful city. 'I have never been to the Kingdom of Bahrain before and I just can't wait to meet you all when I come for Millions of Milkshakes. I'm so excited.' Divorce: The TV personality filed for divorce from basketball star Kris Humphries after 72 days of marriage . Power couple: With current boyfriend rapper Kanye West last week . Though Kardashian's trip centres around the promotional appearance, she previously said that she hoped to meet with local leaders to learn political tensions in the Middle East. The move is likely a damage limitation PR exercise following a Twitter controversy after she tweeted she was 'praying for everyone in Israel' during the recent bombing campaign. After a barrage of furious responses, including death threats, she then posted: 'Praying for everyone in Palestine and across the world.' As part of this pledge she met with Matthew Tueller, the United States ambassador to Kuwait. Kardashian filed for divorce more than a year ago, citing irreconcilable differences, just weeks after the couple's glamorous and televised wedding. Humphries, who plays for the Brooklyn Nets, later filed for an annulment, claiming the marriage was based on fraud but he has yet to lay out any specific evidence for his claim.","Reality TV star flew to Kuwait today and will visit Bahrain this weekend .

A father has miraculously survived after he was hit on the head by a speeding train as he leaned over the edge of a platform to vomit. Stephen Wright's two terrified sons watched as their father's skull was struck with the commuter train, though to be reaching speeds of up to 70mph. Warehouse clerk Stephen was hit after he began to feel unwell while waiting on the platform in Goodmayes, near Ilford, Essex. Warehouse clerk Stephen was struck on the head in front of his two horrified little boys . But against all the odds the 34-year-old father escaped the accident with just shock, whiplash and swelling. The packed commuter train, which was not scheduled to stop at the station, is thought to have been reaching speeds of up to 70mph. Stephen managed to board another train with his two sons Kye, seven, and Keon, five, and went home after the incident. But baffled police did not realise he had staggered away from the scene and searched the tracks for his body after the alarm was raised. Mr Wright, of Upton Park, east London, said: 'My aunt said that God was rolling with me, and she's right. 'There's no way I should be here.' The accident happened after Stephen . picked up his two sons from Barley Lane Primary School in Chadwell Heath . last Wednesday night. He went into the station in Goodmayes Road at about 6.30pm and began to feel unwell. The father managed to board another train after the horrifying accident at Goodmayes Station, Ilford, Essex . He stepped to the edge of the platform to be sick on the tracks and was standing on the yellow line leaning over when the train smashed into him. 'The next thing I knew I felt the biggest bang in my head and I screamed out and grabbed my head,' he recalled with horror. 'I thought I could fall down. 'My son was so scared and I had to be strong.' Deeply shocked and bleeding from his mouth, Stephen managed to stagger across the platform with his sons and board a waiting train to Stratford. He was having tea at his girlfriend's . house in Manor Park as he recovered from his ordeal when a train . accident was reported and the line was closed for two hours that night. Shaken-up . Stephen went to King George Hospital, Goodmayes, the next day after he . suffered swelling to his head and neck as well as whiplash. The packed train (not pictured) smashed into Stephen but left him with just swelling and minor whiplash . He underwent two brain scans at Romford's Queen's Hospital but was given the all-clear. Stephen said it struck home just how lucky he had been to survive after he was tracked down by a police officer involved in the station search for his body after the dramatic scare. 'A policeman told me, 'we were searching for you on the tracks last night'. 'That's when it came to me more and started to sink in,' he said. This is not the first time Stephen has had a brush with death - when he was a baby he plunged 50ft out of his flat. He plummeted five storeys out of a tower block in Hackney, east London, when he was a 15-month-old infant and survived without any broken bones or hardly a scratch. 'Nobody could believe how I'd got out of my cot but I did. 'I fell on the hard concrete - I should have been dead,' he said. A British Transport Police spokesman said: ''BTP officers were called to the line close to Goodmayes rail station on Wednesday, 21 November after a driver reported striking a person on one of the platforms. 'BTP and Essex Police officers attended the incident, which was reported to BTP at 7pm. 'A thorough search of the area was carried out by officers, but no person was found. 'A man in his thirties has since come forward to police reporting he was struck by a train at the station. 'Officers have spoken to the man, who voluntarily attended Goodmayes hospital following the incident, which appears to have been an accident. 'The man sustained minor injuries and has since been discharged from hospital.'","Father-of-two escaped with only whiplash, shock and swelling to his head .

The mother of the youngest British soldier killed in Afghanistan has gone on hunger strike after the Government axed her benefits as a result of his death. Disabled Lucy Aldridge, 44, lost £300-a-week when her housing and council tax benefit, along with income support were stopped after her son William was blown up in a Taliban ambush in July 2009. Before his death, selfless William had instructed his mum to use any insurance money to be used to bring up his younger brothers George, nine, and Archie, seven. His family received a £68,000 . death-in-service (DIS) pay-out, combined with a £150,000 PAX insurance payout. But because it was transferred into . his deceased estate, with Lucy named as the signatory on the account and executor for the estate, rather than into a trust fund for her young sons, the . Government ruled the money made her financially secure. Because the Department for Work and Pensions define compensation as savings, it means that Lucy was technically over the £16,000 threshold which meant her benefits were slashed. As a result, she was forced to use William’s money to live on instead of securing her sons' futures which had been his wish. In a desperate bid to persuade the Government to make DIS pay-outs exempt from means tested benefits, Lucy, from Bredenbury near Bromyard, Herefordshire, went on hunger strike at midnight on Sunday. Lucy, who suffers from the incurable . degenerative condition Hypermobility Syndrome, survives now on £140 a . week in disability, child tax credits and child benefits. She has been threatened with eviction . from her three-bedroom home over rent arrears and warned she faces . bailiffs for non-payment of council tax. Brave William Aldridge asked his mother to use his death-in-service payout put in a trust fund for his two younger brothers . Single mother Lucy says she is protesting about the current rules about payouts after her benefits were cut . Lucy even tried to kill herself by . taking an overdose in June this year after being driven to despair after . struggling to keep William’s promise to keep the money for his . brothers. Speaking before she went on hunger . strike, she said: 'William’s intention was to provide for his younger . brothers in the event of his death. 'I’ve written to David Cameron but his response was that it would be inappropriate for him to get involved in my case. 'I feel he has let me down. I have exhausted every channel open to me.' Today the single mother vowed she would continue to refuse solid food until the Government 'started a dialogue' with her about the issue. Lucy, said: 'Right now I am feeling hungry and tired. 'But I am doing it to give my sons the future their big brother wanted for them and for other military families in my position. 'The boys don’t know what’s going on as they are staying with their grandparents. 'I hope it doesn’t come to it but whether I die or not is in the government’s hands. William, seen here aged 16 with his mother and his two younger brothers, George and Archie, had hoped that the money from his death would be used for their future . William, pictured here taking his oath of allegiance in with the mayor of Hereford and his mother, spent his last few moments trying to help others . 'I’m not doing this to get my benefits back as even if the legislation did change I wouldn’t get them back. 'I’m not doing this on a whim. I’ve been thinking of going on hunger strike for a while but hoped it wouldn’t have to come to it. 'I totally agree that people who have more than £16,000 in savings should not get benefits. 'But by taking into account the DIS (death-in-service) payment, this means the sacrifice of armed forces personnel is not recognised. 'I will survive on fluids. My children will be cared for by close family because I don’t want them to be exposed to what I am doing. 'I will be at home alone. Everything I possess and everything belonging to my late son is here.' William died seven weeks after his 18th birthday while serving with The 2nd Battalion, The Rifles. The troop was hit by two roadside . bombs in a 'daisy chain' Taliban attack in Helmand province - killing . William and four other Riflemen. Brave William spent his last moments helping the injured and comforting badly-wounded commanding officer Major Alistair Field.

North Herefordshire MP Bill Wiggin, who has supported Lucy’s cause since her son’s death, said: 'It is really difficult because losing a son is just a terrible tragedy but I don’t know if this is the right thing to do as she has two little boys. 'I met David Cameron on Monday night and we spoke about this. 'He is sure that the Ministry of Defence will follow the correct procedure and I have raised the issue with the Department of Work and Pensions.' A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman added: 'Money can never compensate for the loss of a loved one, but families of our servicemen and women who are tragically killed on active duty do receive financial support. 'The welfare state is there to help people with very little means to support themselves, and that means that people with savings above £16,000 are usually not eligible for all benefits.

A secret schoolboy lover who abused and killed his girlfriend’s disabled son was jailed for five years yesterday. Cameron Rose was 16 when he swung three-year-old Rhys Lawrie into a wall, breaking his leg and causing fatal injuries. Just four days earlier the little boy, who could barely speak and was . prone to seizures, had been discharged from hospital despite being hit . so hard in the face that he suffered brain damage. Three-year-old Rhys Lawrie suffered a series of injuries at the hand of his mother's boyfriend, Cameron Rose . Rhys' mother Sadie Henry, pictured outside the .

Miss Henry, a former Army medic who had her lover’s name tattooed on her . back, lied to police, paramedics and hospital staff in an effort to . cover up the relationship. At the Old Bailey yesterday, Rose grinned and gave a thumbs-up to Judge Peter Beaumont QC before he was jailed. Now 18 and with convictions for criminal damage and arson, he is likely . to be released in less than two years. Tragic: Three-year-old Rhys Lawrie, who was killed at his home in Eltham, south east London . Trevor Lawrie, pictured leaving the Old Bailey, tried unsuccessfully to mount a legal challenge against the Crown Prosecution Service after they decided not to charge Henry . He has been kept in solitary . confinement at Feltham Young Offenders’ Institution after other inmates . learned of his crimes. Rhys’s grandparents said the ‘absolutely adorable little boy’ was let down at every turn by those charged with protecting him. Retired construction boss Trevor Lawrie, 64, said he would go to the . High Court in a renewed bid to force Miss Henry to face justice. He is convinced that his former daughter-in-law, who was cautioned for . perverting the course of justice, played a role in the killing. And he said more should have been done after Miss Henry admitted physically abusing her other young son four years ago. Mr Lawrie said: ‘The boy was just the fall guy. There have been a lot of cover-ups in this case.’ Rose, of Eltham, south-east London, met Miss Henry at a Bonfire Night barbecue in 2010. The teenager began staying every weekend at the flat in nearby Erith . that Miss Henry shared with Rhys, who attended a school for children . with learning difficulties, and her other son, telling his mother he was . with friends. On January 17 last year, Miss Henry came home to find . Rhys with a badly swollen face. Rose claimed he had accidently elbowed . him and the boy then fell off a kitchen counter. Henry called an ambulance, claiming Rhys had suffered fits. Doctors discharged him, but experts later found he had probably suffered brain damage. Rose killed the youngster four days later, on January 21, after Miss Henry left them watching TV. When she came home the teenager claimed Rhys had suffered a fit and he . had put him in bed. When she pulled back the bedclothes he was dead. Rose later changed his story, claiming Miss Henry had inflicted the injuries. He was cleared of murder but was convicted of manslaughter and the January 17 assault. Bexley Council said an inquiry into the circumstances of Rhys’s death will be published later today.","Cameron Rose was jailed for five years after being found guilty of manslaughter but cleared of the murder of Rhys Lawrie last month .

Veterans aren’t the only ones at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder - man’s best friend can suffer just as much as their human counterparts, experts say. Veterinarians and service dog handlers at Lackland Air Force Base said that dogs - especially those who have been sent to Afghanistan and Iraq to keep U.S. troops safe - shut down after trauma. They estimate that as many as 10 percent of dogs deployed overseas suffer from canine PTSD and need treatment for the condition, just like any human. Cora, pictured with Marine Cpl. Drew Daniel Adams, was once an ace at sniffing out buried bombs in Iraq, before suffering canine post-traumatic stress disorder . Cora, a Belgian Malinois who was used to sniff out bombs and other explosives in Iraq, was described by her trainers as a ‘very squared-away dog.’ She was trained to sniff out buried bombs in the terrain, then lie down once she detected an explosive. Marine Staff Sgt Thomas Gehring, who handles Cora back at Lackland, said that her behavior began to change after a month of sniffing out bombs. She hated being left alone, had become jumpy at loud noises, and would become excessively combative around other dogs. ‘Dogs experience combat just like humans,’ Sgt Gehring explained. Though Cora looks healthy enough, and enjoys treats and belly scratches, her handlers have noticed her severe behavioral change. They describe Cora’s case as a more mild instance of canine PTSD. Gunner, who is believed to suffer from a canine version of PTSD, is comforted by his handler in Helmand Province, Afghanistan . ‘They’re essentially broken and can’t work,’ Lackland chief of behavioral medical and military working-dog studies, Walter Burghardt Jr. told the Los Angeles Times. He added ‘This is something that does not get better without intervention.’ Burghardt added that because dogs cannot verbally express their anxieties, it is harder to treat. The canines are treated much as a human PTSD sufferer would - with conditioning, training, and in some circumstances, medication. The Times notes that dogs like Cora should be treated as a war hero and be allowed to live a life without stress, which would only aggravate her condition. The dogs with more severe cases can often be taught to work in less demanding fields. If their PTSD is too great, they are given up for adoption and given to families. As the Times reports, hundreds more service dogs have been utilized in the military since the September 11 terrorist attacks, with more than 2,500 dogs like Belgian Malinois and German shepherds patrolling. Next month, the U.S. Working Dog Teams National Monument will be unveiled in Los Angeles to honor every dog who has served in combat since World War II. Marine Cpl.

The 15-year-old also pleaded guilty to the charge and . will be sentenced at a later date. Winchester Crown Court heard how Mr Christian, 29, had visited Stanhope's home in July this year before an argument broke out. Victim: Simon Christian suffered severe burns in the attack . The pair stamped on their victim and kicked him before hitting him over the head with a fryer. Rob Welling, prosecuting, said Mr Christian had been tortured by Brewer and Stanhope for a ‘period of considerable time.’ He said: 'Each took different roles and each understood and recognised what the other was doing. 'Over a period of considerable time, . they tortured Simon Christian to the point where they ended up pouring . boiling water over him on a number of occasions where he was in no . position to defend himself.' Neighbours heard the attack and one reported hearing the victim plead: ‘Please don’t burn me again.’ When police officers arrived they found Mr Christian in a ‘dishevelled state’ and covered in blood. The court heard Brewer later sent text messages in which she bragged about the abuse, saying it was ‘too funny.’ She also received a text advising her to clean up the evidence, to which she responded ‘blood’s gone and I don’t think he will remember.’ Adrienne Knight, defending Stanhope, . said her client believed Mr Christian had tried to steal money and she . asked him to leave, but he had refused. Both defendants claimed that Mr Christian had behaved in a provocative way, including urinating at the front door. Defending Brewer, Karen Dempsey claimed that Mr Christian had ‘pinned down’ the 15-year-old on a bed upstairs. Permanently scarred: Victim Simon Christian was left with horrific . injuries after having boiling water poured on him during the attack by . Stanhope, Brewer and a 15-year-old girl . Sentencing the women, Judge Paul Burrell said Stanhope had lashed out to ‘get justice’ and ‘humiliate’ Mr Christian after a ‘certain amount of non-violent provocation.’ He added: 'You opened the door and launched a ferocious and cruel attack. All three of you lost control. 'The pouring of boiling water was quite horrific. Simon Christian could easily have died.' Mr Christian, who is in a relationship with 20-year-old Ellie Wilks, is now coming to terms with his life-changing injuries. The . father-of-one will not be allowed out in the sun for two years because . of the scarring and he is awaiting keyhole surgery on his wrist, which . was broken. He is also seeing a phychiatrist. Speaking after the case, he said: 'I have broken both my legs before and my back, and I would rather go through that again than being burned. 'It’s a whole different type of pain. The burns were a couple of centimetres away from my eyes and that was a scary thought.' He explained he had been drinking with Stanhope, who considered a good friend, before the attack and had been invited back to her house. Things turned ‘nasty’ following an argument, but he denied claims that he provoked them in any way. He said: 'I’m not a violent person. I’m not big enough to be violent.' Jailed: Tamlyn Stanhope and Keeley Brewer were locked up for eight and seven years respectively by a judge at Winchester Crown Court .","WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES .

Shamed: Reverend Brian Shipsides raked in at least £30,000 conducting sham marriages between 2007 and 2010 . A parish vicar who raked in at least £30,000 carrying out sham marriages has been ordered to repay just a fraction of his ill-gotten gains. Reverend Brian Shipsides, 56, was . jailed for four-and-a-half years in April for conducting hundreds of . bogus ceremonies at All Saints church in East London. Charging . £140 a time, he would marry EU nationals with non-EU spouses so they . could claim the right to work and live in the country. Shipsides . had helped nearly 250 immigrants before the plot was smashed by . officers from the Metropolitan Police and the UK Border Agency in 2010. He had travelled around the world on his undeclared income including trips to Egypt and the Far East. At a Proceeds of Crime hearing at Inner London Crown Court yesterday he was ordered to pay back just £10,792. If he fails to pay back the cash within the next six months he faces a further six months imprisonment. Shipsides had taken a cut from his Nigerian ‘fixer’ Amudalat Ladipo, 31, who also charged immigrants to arrange the weddings. When Ladipo was arrested at the church, couples were still queuing up outside for their bogus ceremonies. She dumped a brown envelope in some bushes stuffed with fake identity documents for use in the marriages. By marrying an EU national - mainly Portuguese and Dutch in this case - hundreds of non-EU spouses were successfully married by the scam and hoped to take on the same rights of residence and work. Once wed a ‘strikingly high proportion’ then made applications to the Home Office for the right to remain in the country. In . some cases, EU nationals were even flown into Britain just so the . marriages could take place before being flown straight out again. Since the investigation, just two phoney brides or grooms . who took part in the bogus marriages have been deported while eight have been . jailed. Dozens have gained the right to stay in Britain. Shipsides admitted conspiracy to facilitate breaches of immigration laws and was jailed for four-and-a-half years. Mother-of-two Ladipo, of Grosvenor Road, Dagenham,  was convicted of the same charge and jailed for three years. Suspicious: Police noticed a spike in marriage ceremonies at All Saints church in East London . Sentencing Shipsides at the time, Judge Peter Grobel said he . had shown an ‘arrogant disregard for the legal and church requirements . that couples should attempt to live together in a subsisting . relationship.’ It is thought  Nigerian . Ladipo, described as a ‘prolific and resourceful liar’, was involved in fixing sham marriages at other churches across the UK. Ladipo, who has a six-year-old son, had her immigration appeal refused four months after the swoop when the Home Office voided her marriage. During the investigation, police unearthed the church’s marriage registers to 1971, which demonstrated the sudden spike in weddings. In the two year and seven months period prior to the scam, there were just 15 ceremonies, compared to 250 when the fraudsters were working. Concerned church authorities tried to tighten the regulations by requiring vicars to visit couples in advance of the ceremonies. They had a ‘fraction’ of Shipsides’ knowledge about what was going on but told Shipsides to call off one suspicious union. Sham: Rev Shipsides performing the bogus wedding ceremony of his co-conspirator, Nigerian national Amdudalat Ladipo, to a Dutchman so she could remain in the UK. The Home Office later voided her marriage . Since the scam the regulations for the diocese have been further tightened, with the UK Border Agency requiring notice of the marriage banns having been read in church in advance of ceremonies. Shipsides, the son of a Merseyside police officer read English at Reading University in the 1970s, before receiving his theology training in the 1980s. He worked as a deacon in Leeds in 1982, before being ordained as a priest the following year. In 1986 he moved to London where he took a post at a church in the Notting Hill area, before becoming priest in charge at All Saints and St Edmund’s. Simon Prankard, from the UK Border Agency, said: ‘I am extremely pleased the court has ordered Shipsides to repay this money. By carrying out these weddings, not only was he lining his own pockets but also abusing the high degree of trust others had placed in him. ‘Hopefully this ruling will send out a clear message that not only will we investigate and secure convictions for those involved in this type of criminality, we will also go after the profits they make. ‘This is a successful conclusion to what was a long and complex investigation.’","Reverend Brian Shipsides conducted hundreds of bogus unions at All Saints church in Forest Gate, East London, between 2007 and 2010 .

"By . Lydia Warren and Peter Rugg . PUBLISHED: . 13:24 EST, 13 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:56 EST, 13 November 2012 . More than a year after Donald Wheeler killed himself, the child welfare worker has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the death of a five-year-old girl who was beaten to death by her father after being placed in his care by the Department of Human Services. After the death of Serenity Deal, 5, DHS employees came under fire for placing her with her father even though she was injured twice during overnight visits . with him in January 2011. He claimed he had accidentally dropped her. 'I find nothing in any of the investigation that does anything but exonerate Donald Wheeler,' Pottawatomie County District Attorney Richard Smothermon told NewsOK Friday. 'Donald Wheeler repeatedly tried to warn these [workers] not to . place this child with Sean Brooks, and he was repeatedly ignored.' WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE . Cleared: Prosecutors say Donald Wheeler is one of the few people who warned against putting Serenity Deal, 5, in the care of her father because of his history of abuse . Wheeler's body was discovered against a barb wire fence in the woods near an Oklahoma baseball camp by a family friend in July 2011. 'He . came out here to walk at 7:30 this morning,' said an unidentified . family friend in a 911 call recording. 'His wife called me, found his . car empty, and we've been walking all over this campground and i just . found him on the ground.' At the time, Wheeler was on paid administrative leave from his position and one of four Oklahoma Department of Human Services employees under investigation in the death. They'll pay: Samantha Deal is suing the Oklahoma DHS for $3 million for negligence in the death of her daughter. Deal is in prison for molesting a young boy . Serenity was beaten to death by Brooks just a month after she was placed in his care. Serenity's official cause of death was a head . injury. An autopsy also noted she had seven recently fractured ribs as . well as scrapes and bruises covering her head and body, NewsOK reported. Records show Wheeler had urged caution because Brooks demonstrated abusive behavior in the past. As Wheeler was exonerated, two other DHS workers, Pottawatomie County child welfare specialist Randy J. Lack and supervisor Jennifer Shawn, were charged with suppressing evidence in the case. The girl's mother, Samantha Deal, is suing the Oklahoma Department of Human Services for $3 million as she believes the state's . negligence led to the girl's 'untimely passing.' The suit calls for $1 . million for each of her two daughters and herself. The mother is herself in prison after being sentenced to 15 years for molesting a young boy. Serenity had previously been in foster care because of the charges against her mother. She was killed less than a month after she was placed in his care in his Oklahoma City apartment. In December, Brooks, 32, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in jail. The death sparked public outrage against the department and led to the firing of two workers. Another resigned. Killer: Serenity's father Sean Devon Brooks (left) beat her to death when she was placed in his care, despite her suffering injuries just six months prior (right) when he claimed he dropped her accidentally . Loss: Serenity also told state workers her father had dropped her and they believed the story . The agency's director, Howard . Hendrick, also retired as public confidence in his leadership plummeted. The agency has since admitted that workers did not handle the case appropriately as they did not check the man's criminal record and discover that he had been violent in the past. During visits to his home the January before her death, Serenity suffered black eyes and bruises on her face, and said her father had dropped her, a story which DHS . workers accepted. Workers were also accused of failing to give the court photos or a full description of the injuries or divulge that Brooks did not seek medical care for his daughter. 'The negligent acts of OKDHS were the . proximate cause of Serenity Deal's untimely passing and the claimant ... has suffered damages as a result thereof,' the claim states. Angelic: Serenity died of a head trauma and had seven recent fractured ribs. State workers failed to report the details of the previous injuries to the courts and did not check Brooks's criminal background . Retired: Following public outcry, former Oklahoma DHS director Howard Hendrick stepped down . 'It's awful. It's awful,' Deal's attorney, Jim Loepp, told NewsOK. 'What DHS did, it was just horrifying to me.' 'We are reviewing the claim,' said DHS attorney, Richard Freeman. It comes after Serenity's grandparents, Chuck and Annette Deal, made a claim against the state over the girl's death. Serenity had lived with them for three years before going to foster homes. They tried to adopt her but she was placed in foster care when they were accused of letting Serenity stay with her mother overnight. Last September, DHS commissioners formed a committee to investigate her death. She was the fourth child under the supervision of DHS in two Oklahoma counties to die in nine years.","Report shows Donald Wheeler warned Department of Human Services not to place Serenity Deal, 5, with her abusive father, Sean Brooks .

"By . Hugo Gye, Meghan Keneally and Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 12 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:56 EST, 12 November 2012 . A top Democrat has warned that David Petraeus must testify to the Senate about the terror attack in Benghazi - and he could be forced to do so by legal means. Dianne Feinstein insisted it was 'unacceptable' that the former CIA director had not yet given Congress an account of a trip to Libya he made shortly before his resignation last week, and threatened to seek a subpoena to obtain it. Petraeus was due to discuss the CIA's role in the raid which killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans before Congress on Thursday. However, after he stepped down from the agency when it was revealed that he carried out an extra-marital affair with his married biographer, it was announced that his acting replacement, deputy director Mike Morell, would testify instead. Scroll down for video . Close: Paula Broadwell is thought to be David Petraeus' mistress and she spoke publicly about the government's handling on the attack on the Libyan embassy . Officials say Petraeus will testify at a later date, as speculation has raged about the possibility he could have shared confidential information about Benghazi with his mistress Paula Broadwell. Feinstein, the senator for California who is chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC that the decorated former general would have to give details about a fact-finding mission he apparently made to Benghazi a few weeks ago. 'I believe that there is a trip report,' she said. 'We have to asked to see the trip report. One person tells me has read it. And then we try to get it, and they tell me it hasn't been done. 'That's unacceptable. We are entitled to this trip report, and if we have to go to the floor of the Senate on a subpoena, we will do just that.' Threat: Dianne Feinstein warned that the Senate Intelligence Committee could subpoena Petraeus . However, despite the controversy over the timing of Petraeus' resignation, just three days after the presidential election and less than a week before his scheduled testimony, the long-serving senator said she had no reason to think it was linked to the Benghazi scandal. But she added: 'The skin of the onion is getting peeled off. We don't know what we may find.' Suspicions over how much Broadwell knew about the Benghazi probe could complicate Petraeus' testimony over the controversial issue. Broadwell, a married army veteran who met Petraeus in 2006, was speaking at the University of Denver on October 26 when she was asked about the September 11 attack. 'Now I don’t know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually - had taken a couple . of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the . consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back,' she said, according to the Daily Beast. 'So that's . still being vetted.' In response, the CIA denied that claim on Sunday when the tape of Broadwell's talk surfaced, saying that it was not true. The agency confirmed that since 2009 they have not had the authority to detain prisoners. 'Any suggestion that the Agency is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless,' they told the site. The only other news station to report that claim at the time that Broadwell made her speech to the University of Denver was Fox News, which she references moments before making the claim about the alleged prisoners. According to the clearest timeline of Broadwell and Petraeus' alleged affair, which is said to have started in 2011 and ended in 'early summer' of this year, they would have been broken up for at least a few months by the time of this conference. She went on to defend both the government's controversial reaction to the crisis and the CIA's lack of disclosure. Disclosing possible secrets: At the Denver talk in October, Broadwell spoke about a theory that the embassy was holding a number of Libyan prisoners at the time of the September 11 attack . Making the rounds: She spoke regularly about Petraeus in an effort to promote her book . 'The challenging thing for General . Petraeus is that in his new position he is not allowed to communicate . with the press. So he’s known all of this, they had correspondence with . the CIA station chief in Libya. Within 24 hours they kind of knew what . was happening,' she said. 'If you remember at the time, the Muslim video, the Mohammed video that came out, the demonstrations that were going on in Cairo- there were demonstrations in 22 other countries at the time, tens of thousands of people and our government was very concerned that this was going to become a nightmare for us. 'So you can understand if you put yourself in his shoes, or Secretary Clinton's shoes, or the President's shoes, that we thought it was tied somehow to the demonstrations in Cairo. It's true that we have signal intelligence that shows the militia members in Libya were watching the demonstrations in Cairo and that did galvanize their efforts. 'As a former intel officer, it’s frustrating to me because it reveals our sources and methods. I don’t think the public needs to know all of that. Broadwell has come under intense scrutiny ever since Petraeus, the four star general credited with the surge in Afghanistan, submitted his resignation citing an extramarital affair. Working benefits: Broadwell wrote that she learned a great deal by being mentored by Petraeus . Out: Petraeus resigned on Friday November 9 citing an extramarital affair . During the lengthy discussion, Broadwell's high aspirations are clear as she spoke repeatedly about how she has had the life-long goal of becoming the National Security Adviser. When asked if she had the chance to talk to any previous NSA's, she said that she had not but she considers 'Maddie' and 'Condi' to be great role models, referring to Madeline Albright and Condoleezza Rice by their nicknames. Broadwell's high achieving personality and her unusually comfortable nature around Petraeus raised concerns among Petraeus' close advisers in the year leading up to the revelation of the affair. To those outside the general's tight-knit circle, however, news of the affair came as a big surprise when it was announced on Friday. Petraeus was expected to make headlines when he was made to testify in front of Congress about what and when the CIA knew regarding the timeline of events in Libya when a group of terrorists stormed the consulate killing ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The affair was discovered by the FBI when they responded Jill Kelley, a Florida woman and friend of Petraeus who allegedly received email threats from Broadwell. Both Kelley and Broadwell are married with children, but that didn't stop Broadwell from becoming defensive of Petraeus. She supposedly told Kelley to 'stay away from my man'. Though there were multiple threatening emails, none of them were considered criminal so the FBI has not charged the army reservist. News of the affair 'was like a lightning bolt', said Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Petraeus was scheduled to testify in front of Congress on Thursday, but that has since been pushed back in light of his resignation. Now his replacement, CIA deputy director Michael Morell, will appear instead of Petraeus. Feinstein went on to say that just because Petraeus no longer works at the CIA, that does prohibit Congress from compelling him to testify about Benghazi at a later date.

'It did seem odd to me,' his boss, William Cartwright, said. 'I expected more of a splinter or scrape . than what looked like rope burns.' Still, community members and Jeffrey's . father Bernard maintain that he is innocent. It took two days to find . an impartial, 12-member jury.

'The people in the community are . hugely supportive of this young man,' Detroit Free Press journalist Lori . Brasier told ABC News. 'Even people who believe he may have actually . killed his mother still support him, and you don't usually find that in . the community.' The defense has suggested that the . brutal murder could have been committed by an intruder although nothing . was stolen from the home, according to the Detroit News.

R&B artist Ryan Leslie is singing the blues now that he's been ordered to dish out $1million to a German man who returned his stolen laptop. The decision came down from a New York judge on Wednesday, ending a two-year legal battle with the German man who brought it back to him. Leslie was desperate to find the computer and an external hard drive stolen from him in 2010, which he said contained several 'in development' tracks he was working on. Facing defeat: Ryan Leslie is pictured entering Federal Court in Manhattan, on Wednesday morning before a judge ruled in favor of German auto shop owner Armin Augstein . He made a YouTube plea, urging anybody who finds the laptop to hand it in and receive a $1million reward. But when German auto shop proprietor Armin Augstein turned up with the laptop, Leslie reneged on the deal, after he couldn't access the songs on the hard drive. Reaping the benefits: Augstein, of Pulheim, Germany, said that he felt 'very good' about the verdict now that he's $1million richer . Armstein took him to court, and Judge . Harold Baer Jr ruled that since Leslie returned the hard drive to the . computer company to have it wiped of its contents, the songs were likely . there as Armstein returned it, according to the New York Post. Augstein, of Pulheim, Germany, told The Post that he felt 'very good' about the verdict. Speaking in German and translated by one . his lawyers, Steven Thal, Augstein told the paper: 'I'm very happy… that the . American judicial system, which is so totally different from ours, . functioned so well with a jury that are not professionals and are . laymen.' Augstein added: 'No one forced him to make an offer of so much money for a finder's fee. It seems like he believes that that which he promised, he doesn’t have to live up to.' Leslie accepted defeat in the matter, . evoking his own lyrics as he told his Twitter fans: '""Ain't no way to . get around ups & downs."" Jury of my peers rules for the plaintiff.' As for Augstein, he told the Post that he is in no rush to spend his $1million award. He told the paper: 'As we say here in Germany, we can only eat the chicken after it’s been plucked.'

A New York businessman claims that Jill Kelley was so eager to close a billion-dollar business deal that the Florida socialite stood up her own husband on their anniversary. Kelley reportedly met Adam Victor at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. Shortly after they were introduced by mutual friend Don Phillips, the two began to talk business. Victor is the president and CEO of TransGas Development Systems, a New York-based firm dedicated to the pursuit of clean energy. Connections: Emails reveal that Jill Kelley, pictured leaving her Florida home last week, bailed on anniversary plans with her husband with the goal of sealing an energy deal . Kelley claimed that in her capacity as honorary consul for South Korea, she could help Victor set up a coal plant there. Emails between Kelley and Victor exclusively obtained by ABC News revealed how Kelley doggedly pursued the deal. Energy mogul: Kelley claimed that in her capacity as honorary consul for South Korea, she could help Adam Victor set up a coal plant there . At one point, Kelley emailed Victor: 'Adam, I'm on my flight. It was wonderful to meet with you. I was quite impressed learning about the project to say the least. 'I'm emailing around some contacts, calling in favors, and totally anxious to take this to the next step. It has HUGE potential. It just needs a catalyst like me. :-)' While wheeling and dealing with Victor, Phillips claimed to ABC that Kelley wasn't interested in moving forward, telling him: 'As a result of my personal investigations and business intelligence this is just not going anywhere, Don, and you just don't want to associate with [Victor].' But Kelley soon emailed one of Victor's employee, saying she was blowing off her husband Scott on their anniversary so that she could speak more about the South Korea deal. The email shown to the network read: '[M]y husband is in agreement with me canceling our 13th Anniversary dinner plans. Please call me.' But the deal apparently collapsed . when Kelley informed Victor of the commission she was hoping to take in . for helping to complete the deal - a whopping 2 per cent, or $80million. Victor's . next email informed Kelley: 'The suggested fee you have asked for is so . out of market, I have no way of working out any acceptable deal with . you. You should not contact anyone on our behalf.' Victor . said he was told by Kelley that Petraeus had set her up as an honorary . consul to South Korea, a claim refuted by the general's longtime . spokesman, retired Army Col Steve Boylan. Phillips, Kelley's friend, also told ABC that she has never sought any benefits from . her friendship with the disgraced general. Socialite: Kelley kisses General Petraeus at an awards ceremony for him at her home last year . Kelley is the woman who blew the lid off the Petraeus affair and ensuing scandal after she received threatening emails from the generals mistress and biographer, Paula Broadwell. It was revealed on Tuesday that the Florida socialite took multiple flights aboard military aircraft on the taxpayers' dime. She even reportedly flew to . Washington, DC, with General John Allen - the military commander she is . said to have exchanged tens of thousands of emails with while he was in . Afghanistan. It is not . known why Kelley, 37, flew to the U.S. capital with Allen but it has . emerged that in recent months she has had three visits to the White . House. Close: Jill Kelley (second right) and her twin sister Natalie (left) are pictured with David Petraeus, his wife Holly and Kelley's husband Scott (centre) at a party at their Tampa home . The mother of three from Tampa has so far refused to comment publicly on her role in the scandal that ended the career of CIA director Petraeus and put the distinguished career of Allen in jeopardy. The commander of the coalition forces in Afghanistan is under investigation for 'flirty' emails said to number as many as 30,000 that he exchanged with Kelley. An investigation by 10 News Tampa has revealed that Kelley, whose complaint over threatening emails revealed David Petraeus' affair, has enjoyed several trips on military planes. The news stations said they have made several requests to defense officials to see how many times Kelley has flown from the MacDill Air Force base where she acted as an unpaid social liaison officer. Pentagon officials told News 10 they have not been able to track down the exact number of flights. But they did confirm she flew on a KC-135 jet in May 2010. Travel partner: She reportedly travelled with Gen. John Allen, who is pictured with his wife and daughter. Allen is now under investigation after exchanging 'flirty' emails with Kelley . Tour: Kelley has travelled on a KC-135, pictured, which military staff use to show the public what they do . The KC-135 jets are primarily used to refuel other aircraft in mid-air. 'It's an educational opportunity for people to just see what hard working military members are doing each day,' Lt. Col. Jack Miller told the TV station. Officials said about 150 people each year take an orientation flight at MacDill, with the flights leaving and then returning to Tampa. 'I've seen anything from community leaders to Cub Scouts to sports teams. 'But by in large, it's generally folks throughout the community that just have an interest in the instillation. Sometimes it's just a matter of requesting to do it.' Kelley, who is mired in debt and facing foreclosure on her $1.3million home overlooking Tampa Bay, sparked the investigation into Petraeus after she went to the FBI after receiving threatening emails from Paula Broadwell, the general's biographer. Unstoppable: Jill Kelley, pictured with General Petraeus and his wife Holly at her home last year, visited the White House three times in three months as the guest of an aide, it has emerged . 'Courtesy': Kelley and her sister were invited to dine at the White House on two occasions by a mid-level aide . The latest example of how she rubbed . shoulders with the military's top brass comes after it emerged she has . visited the White House three times in the past three months. The shrewd socialite and . her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, were invited to two 'courtesy' meals . in the Executive Mansion mess hall as a guest of a White House aide. She . met the mid-level aide through her work with MacDill Air Force Base . near Tampa, where she also rubbed shoulders with the military bosses . including General Petraeus. On one further occasion, she received a White House tour with her family, the official added. It confirms that Kelley was telling the truth in an email she wrote to a reporter at the Tampa Bay Times on September 28, in which she boasted of visiting the White House. 'Btw I was made the [honorary] Ambassador to US Central Command's Coalition!' she wrote. 'In addition to that, I was just recently appointed to be the Honorary Consulate General to South Korea! I'm in DC today - just left from breakfast at the White House.... I really hope to see you soon!' Rubbing shoulders: Jill Kelley, left, and her twin sister Natalie Khawam pose with Marco Rubio, then a candidate for Senate, in March 2010. They only attended his event for the photo, staff said . Host: Kelley, who worked as a volunteer social liaison for the military, with Petreaus and his wife Holly . Demands: She had earlier asked for diplomatic protection at her $1.3 million home in Tampa . Who's who? A chart shows the connections between the major players in the Petraeus scandal . Kelley's shrewd social-climbing . tactics also came to light this week when she was pictured with Marco . Rubio and her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, when he was running for the Senate. The photograph was tweeted by Republican Angelette Aviles who said that it was taken at a March 2010 fundraiser, where tickets were $1,000. But the twins didn't pay - instead, they . appeared to have taken the photo and left, Aviles told the Tampa Bay Times, and never contributed to the Rubio campaign. Yet over the past week, Kelley's connections have given her more exposure than she was perhaps intending. After Petraeus dramatically resigned from the top of the CIA last Friday, it emerged that Kelley had played a key role in exposing his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. Affair: Kelley tipped off the FBI about threatening emails she received from Paula Broadwell, right, and during their investigation they uncovered her affair with David Petraeus . In May, Kelley alerted the FBI that . she had been receiving threatening, anonymous emails warning her to . 'back off' Petraeus, whom Kelley and her husband are good friends with. The . FBI was forced to launch an in-depth investigation as some messages . contained classified information about Petraeus' whereabouts, and they . feared there could have been a security breach. The catty emails were traced back to Broadwell and, in the process of the investigation, agents also uncovered messages revealing the affair between the biographer and Petraeus. The scandal later dragged in another general, the U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen, after the FBI investigated Kelley's emails from Broadwell. During the probe, they reportedly uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of email correspondence between Allen and Kelley, which officials said were 'flirtatious' and likened them to 'phone sex'. Both Allen and Kelley deny any wrongdoing. But Kelley has been told has been that she is no longer welcome at the military headquarters near her Florida home.","Jill Kelley tried to broker deal with energy mogul Adam Victor .

Smiling with his arms around his three young children as his wife looks on, Benjamin Johnson III is the picture of a supportive husband and father. And on Saturday, Mr Johnson made the ultimate sacrifice in a bid to save his children's lives, perishing in an early-morning fire after he ran back inside to save them. But along with their father, nine-year-old Ben, eight-year-old Leslie and four-year-old Ryan all died in the blaze that took firefighters two hours to extinguish. Only their mother, Christine Johnson, survived the deadly flames after escaping from a second-storey window onto the roof of their home in Orrington, Maine. Ripped apart: Christine Johnson was the only survivor of the fatal Orrington fire that killed her husband Ben Johnson III and their children (from left) Leslie, Benjamin Johnson IV and Ryan . Cardboard boxes left inches from a wood-burning stove are being blamed as the cause of the blaze. The fact that the family was only using the stove temporarily as they waited for loan approval to finance their purchase of a new furnace only adds to the tragedy of the situation. A funeral will be held on Sunday, and the community is holding a bowling fundraiser on December 9 at the Family Fun and Hollywood Casino, where the family went hours before the tragedy. 'Christine was very moved by the support when I talked to her last night,' family friend Mike Marsh wrote on the Facebook page for the event. 'She is very grateful for the love . and support she is getting and so amazed at how much love and support . the bowling family is showing.' The Bangor Daily News reports that . when the fire department arrived on the scene, they tried to enter . through a window but ruled the blaze too dangerous and were forced to . pull back. Tragic: Christine Johnson, 31, survived by climbing out a window but she realized that her husband and three children, including Leslie, four, 'went the wrong way' Bucksport fire . chief Craig Bowden said that the four victims were likely already dead . when the responders got to the scene around 2.30am. Neighbors Terri and Doug Winslow called the police when they heard Christine screaming and they called the fire department. 'We . jumped out of bed and saw the orange fire on the front of the . house,' neighbor Terri Winslow told the Bangor Daily News. 'I called 911 while my husband jumped into some clothes. 'While I was on the phone with emergency, I opened the . window and hollered out to her that I heard her and she kept hollering . to please help. '(Christine) said that her husband and kids were in the house which I relayed to 911. When . I opened the window I heard her and her husband talking ... and she . just kept saying ""they went the wrong way, they went the wrong way!""' Horror: A fire at this rural wood home early on Saturday killed a father and his three children, while the childrens' mother escaped and was taken to a hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation . The bodies of the three children were found in a bedroom on the second floor while the father’s body was found at the top of the stairs nearby. Christine was on the roof when emergency workers arrived. This fire - which is the deadliest fire in Maine in the past 20 years - is not the family’s first tragedy, as The Portland Press Herald reports that one of the couple’s son Thomas died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2007. Christine Johnson is still being treated for smoke inhalation at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and is fielding visits from friends as she plans the funerals for her husband and children. 'Ben was her soul, the kids were her soul, so I just don’t know how well she’s going to recover,' her friend Tabitha Robertson told the paper. 'It’s just been one thing after another for her.' Deadly: Firefighting crews from Bangor and four other towns were called in after the fire was reported at around 2:30 a.m., and it took an hour to extinguish the blaze . Remainders: The husband was found at the top of the stairs on the second floor and the three children were found together in a second floor bedroom . The children attended Center Drive School where Principal Roy Allen described them as 'great kids, very nice kids.' 'This is just such a tragedy. It's going to be devastating for the kids because it's such a small school and everybody knows everybody,' Allen told the Bangor Daily News. The Johnsons had just moved into the house in the rural town of Orrington six months ago. They were in the process of buying the house through a short sale, meaning that it would take months for the loan agreement would be finalized by the lender, JP Morgan Chase, in the coming months. Once the sale was approved, they were planning on replacing the 46-year-old hot water furnace, which explains their use of the wood stove with a propane heater. The Johnsons arrived home late Friday night after an evening of family bowling and lit the stove in the first floor living room. Investigators found empty cardboard boxes - which were likely used as kindling to start the fire in the first place - just inches away from the stove. A container of lighter fluid was nearby as well, which added to the pace at which the fire spread. Damage: The fire ravaged the house and caused part of the roof to collapse . Tragic end of a nice night: The family lit the fire to keep the house warm after returning home from a night at the local bowling lanes . Police are still investigating the fire, but their initial reports suggest that they did not have smoke alarms installed in the home. One of the last people to see the husband and children alive was the owner of their local bowling center, Family Fun, who was in shock at the news of the fire. ‘The entire bowling center is in shock. It feels like he’s been here forever,’ owner Andy Meucci said of Benjamin Johnson. Her work: Christine Johnson works from home and self published this novel over the summer . ‘We were surprised he was only 30 because it seems like he’s been here so long. He started up with the Saturday morning youth league and did that for five or six years and has been in adult leagues ever since,’ Meucci told the Bangor Daily News. Benjamin worked at Hollywood Casino in Bangor and Christine is a self-published author who released her first book ‘The Quest For The Enchanted Stone’ earlier this summer. In her brief author bio, she describes herself as living happily in a small town in Maine with her husband of 10 years. She also says that she is the mother of four, including her son Thomas who died in 2007. 'I enjoy drawing, and have enough books in my house to start my own bookstore. I enjoy horseback riding, singing, and as strange as this sounds, yard work. I've travelled all over as an ex-military brat,' she wrote. Friends and family remembered . how the children had vivid imaginations, playing 'spies' with each other . at the house, where the family had moved just six months ago. Ryan loved hot dogs and Disney shows, . while his big sister hoped to be a horse trainer or jockey when she . grew up, and loved helping her mother in the kitchen. Their big brother Benjamin shared . many of his father's hobbies - building and bowling - and looked forward . to learning golf with his dad and grandfather. Center Drive School remained open during the Veteran’s Day holiday Monday in order for the victim’s classmates to meet with grief counsellors that were available. One of those students was Hatty May Hubler, whose mother Jennifer brought the third grader to meet with a counsellor because she was friends with Leslie. 'It's hard trying to come to terms with it. It comes in waves but the school is doing a good job for the students,' Ms Hubler said.

The offenders were picking up council tax discounts worth £1.4million by falsely claiming they lived alone. But they were caught out by technology that analyses phone calls for signs of stress in the speaker’s voice. Lie detector: Southwark council is using voice stress analysis software to catch benefits . cheats - a move which is credited as catching some 4,000 fraudsters and . saving more than £1,400,000 in four months . Southwark council in South London used the system to check on 53,000 households claiming the 25 per cent council tax discount. It found that in approximately one in 13 cases, the discount was being wrongly claimed. A council spokesman said: ‘We are very . pleased with the results. Between July and November, we have removed . 3,851 people from the list of those claiming the discount. ‘It has resulted in additional bills of £1.4million of council tax which is payable.’ The voice risk analysis system works . by analysing the pitch of callers’ voices when they are asked questions . by council officials. If the system suspects a lie is being . told, a beep sounds in the operator’s ear. Once alerted, the operator is . trained to begin asking questions that may uncover the truth. It can lead to a full investigation . into claims for housing benefit, council tax, income support and . jobseeker’s allowance. Claimants are warned in advance that the phone . call is being ‘recorded and monitored for the detection of fraud’. Anyone who refuses to take part in the . call is likely to be visited in person for an assessment of their . claim. It is not the first time lie detectors have been used by . councils. Investigators working for Southwark council (pictured) have begun using software which analyses telephone calls from claimants for signs of stress in their voices . Lie detectors were trialled by former Work and Pensions Secretary John Hutton four years ago with 24 councils across Britain . Former work and pensions secretary John Hutton ordered a pilot . study four years ago in which 24 local authorities tested the concept. Two years ago, however, the  Government abandoned the detector tests saying they were unreliable. An academic study also raised doubts by suggesting the technology was little better than ‘astronomy’ at detecting fraud. Insurance companies similar systems to catch fraudsters. A Southwark spokesman said claimants . who did not speak English as their first language or had hearing or . cognitive problems were exempt from the voice checks. Richard Livingstone, the council’s cabinet member for finance and resources, said: ‘We are taking a tough stance against fraud. ‘Any resident found making a false claim will be fully investigated and the necessary action taken.’ A spokesman for Capita – the private . firm contracted by Southwark to carry out the checks – said it preferred . not to describe it as a lie detector test, insisting it used the voice . checking system together with ‘behavioural analysis by trained . operators’. He insisted: ‘The technology is not used in isolation.’ A spokesman for London Councils said he did not know of any other authorities in the capital using the system. A similar response was given by a . spokesman for the Local Government Association, which represents 423 . authorities across Britain. Harrow Council has used the voice analysis system to check on housing benefit and council tax benefit claims.

Brazen thieves have stolen $1.5m worth of Apple iPad minis from the JFK airport cargo hold - the same site as the 1978 Lufthansa heist which inspired mob film GoodFellas. The crooks, who used the airport's own forklift to shift the haul of two pallets of tablet computers into a nearby truck, struck shortly before midnight on Monday. It is exactly the same building that $5million in cash and nearly $900,000 worth of jewellery was stolen from on December 11, 1978 during the heist. The robbery has been ranked as America's largest haul of cash ever. The thieves could have stolen more, the New York Post reports, but they drove off leaving three more pallets of the Apple tablets behind after they were challenged by an airport worker returning from a break. A source told the paper: 'So, as a caper goes, it was probably unsuccessful' Police have since been questioning airport workers and given three of them lie detector tests, the sources said. The possibility of an inside job has not been ruled out. It is believed the thieves arrived at Building 261 around 11pm, in a white tractor trailer marked with the name CEVA on the side, it has been reported. They pulled up to a side of the airport building which faces onto a street and has less security than the other side. It is also accessible from the airport tarmac.

Goodfellas: The Martin Scorsese film was inspired by the infamous heist in which thieves made off with the equivalent of $21million . Cargo: The $1.5m worth of Apple iPad minis were taken from the JFK airport cargo hold . Airport sources believe someone let them into the area and then let them out after they grabbed the iPads. They took about 3,600 of the minis that were being shipped by a company called Cargo Airport Services, which said the iPads had just arrived from China and were destined for locations around the US. In the  Lufthansa heist $5 million in cash and nearly $900,000 was taken, which if adjusted for inflation would be some $21million today. The alleged mastermind of the robbery was Luchese crime-family associate James 'Jimmy the Gent' Burke. He allegedly got away with the crime after 'whacking' nearly all of his co-conspirators in the heist.

Mr Godfrey, a cable technician, also had his bladder ripped off and suffered bowel damage and a broken pelvis . He had skin removed from his leg for a graft (pictured) to cover a band about a foot wide where his skin had been ripped away . He has since taught himself to walk again . On the night he was admitted to the Queens Medical Centre he was operated on by surgeon, Mr Daren Forward. Mr Forward said: 'When he came in it was clear he’d been crushed under a lorry. He had a bleed in his head, with a substantial head injury. Five months after the horrific smash Mr Godfrey has made a full recovery, thanks to staff at the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham. As well as undergoing emergency surgery, the 23-year-old has had a skin graft to repair his thigh. He also had a titanium plate inserted into his skull to keep the shape of his head relatively normal. Prior to going home, he also required extensive physiotherapy to walk again - and succeeded, despite initially being warned he may be paralysed. 'The skin had essentially been ripped off his body in a band about a foot wide. His bowel had been damaged and his bladder ripped off.'

'It was a strain at first - I couldn’t even feed myself but it’s a lot better now.' Mr Godfrey's father Graham, 48, said: 'When we first arrived at the hospital, we were only allowed to see Lewis very briefly. 'They draped a sheet over him to cover his injuries, and I held his hand for a bit, and whispered in his ear to keep fighting. 'There were at least 12 tubes in him, and there was a huge bandage wrapped around his head.' Five months on, Mr Godfrey is well on the road to recovery. Although he faces further surgery and physiotherapy he hopes to be back at work by January.","Lewis Godfrey, 23, was attacked on a night out and pushed into the road, where he was dragged under the wheels of a lorry .

Louis Walsh has today accepted 500,000 euro (£403,500) in libel damages from The Sun in Ireland after it published a story falsely claiming he had sexually assaulted a man in a Dublin nightspot. The out-of-court deal was reached after the X Factor judge sued News Group Newspapers over a story published last year based on a false allegation by an unemployed dance teacher. Leonard Watters was jailed for six months in July for wrongly accusing music mogul Walsh of groping him in a celebrity nightclub after a Westlife concert in April 2011. Scroll down for video . The case was launched after a story based on an unfounded sex assault allegation against Walsh (pictured outside court today) X Factor judge Louis Walsh (centre) on his way into court today with his legal team solicitor Paul Tweed (right) and Gavin Bonner (left). Walsh has settled a 500,000 euro (£403,500) defamation action against The Sun . Eoin McCullough, senior counsel for News Group Newspapers, read a statement to the High Court in Dublin apologising to Walsh. 'The Sun published an article in its editions of 23 June 2011, in which we reported that Louis Walsh was being investigated in relation to a sexual assault on Leonard Watters,' he said. Leonard Watters, 24, who accused X-Factor judge Louis Walsh of groping him in a nightclub. He was jailed for six months in July for lying . 'In fact it transpired that Leonard Watters had made a false statement to An Garda Siochana, and he has since been convicted in relation to this matter. 'The Sun fully accepts that the alleged assault did not occur in the first place and Louis Walsh is entirely innocent of any such assault. 'The Sun unreservedly apologies to Louis Walsh for any distress caused to him as a result of our article.' Walsh took legal action against the Murdoch group for damages over the article published on June 23 2011 with the headline 'Louis Probed Over ‘Sex Attack’ on Man in Loo'. The paper accepted the accusation was false but initially denied defamation, saying that it had acted fairly as the story was based on police inquiries in to the allegation. Outside court, Walsh said he would not have wished what happened to him on his worst enemy. 'I’m very relieved,  this has had a terrible effect on me guys. It was all lies. 'And I’m very satisfied with this total vindication for me, but I remain very angry at the treatment I received at the hands of The Sun.' Walsh’s lawyer Paul Tweed confirmed his client would be paid damages of 500,000 euro, along with his legal costs. 'This headline story should never have been published,' Mr Tweed said. 'Although the person who fabricated the story has since been convicted in the criminal courts, this is a prime example of the serious damage that can be inflicted on an individual, whether they are well known or not, by the publication of totally unfounded allegations which, in the age of the internet, can circumnavigate the globe in a matter of seconds. 'The serious consequences of worldwide dissemination online of a defamatory story is a fundamental problem which Lord (Justice) Leveson’s report, to be published tomorrow in the UK, will hopefully address on the principle that prevention is always better than cure.' Mr Walsh said he felt vindicated by the settlement and said that the story had started with The Irish Sun. Walsh said he had a 'good relationship' with journalists but remained angry at the way he was treated by the paper . 'I have the utmost respect and time for most journalists with whom I’ve always enjoyed a good relationship,' he said. Walsh said he remained angry at the way he was treated by the paper. 'I am therefore absolutely gutted and traumatised that these allegations against me should have been published, particularly as I had made it clear at the time there was not one iota of truth in them, that I was totally bewildered as to who would have made up this type of story,' he said. 'Although the perpetrator has since been convicted as a result of concocting the allegations this didn’t stop the story being spread all around the world as a result of The Sun’s headlines.' He added that while no amount of money would compensate him for what he had been through he was glad to have achieved a decisive and categorical settlement.","Walsh was falsely accused of groping a man outside a celebrity nightclub in 2011 .

FBI Special Agent Fred Humphries has been identified as the 'Shirtless FBI Agent' who helped begin the investigation that brought down David Petraeus . It was Humphries who initiated the . investigation into harassing emails sent to Kelley that ultimately led . to the resignation of Petraeus. Amid the heat of that exposure the . news of his own apparent indiscretion was treated as another layer of . sexual intrigue in this tangled tale. In fact, Humphries insists, it is . nothing of the sort. The email was a joke that backfired more . spectacularly than he could possibly have imagined and, perhaps, was . allowed to. Emails to a friend: Socialite Jill Kelly arrives home in Tampa on Tuesday night . The image in question was not some . leering pose, directed at the object of his desire, but a round-robin . joke - the sort of which the 47-year-old Special Agent was in the habit . of sending - that ended with a picture punchline. In stark contrast to the covert 'dead . drop' technique of Broadwell and Petraeus's email correspondence, . Humphries's message was sent from an account he shared with his wife, . teacher Sara. The snapshot showing Humphries - . bald, muscular and shirtless - posed between two buff, bullet-ridden . target dummies and carrying the punchline, 'Which one is Fred?' was . framed and displayed on his wife's desk at work. His supervisor even . pinned it on the notice board in the Bureau. Serious: Humphries is pictured at a news conference in July 2005 at the Federal Courthouse in Seattle . In fact as the Seattle Times reports, . one of the newspaper's staff was among those to receive the email, sent . in 2010 shortly after the Special Agent had been transferred from .

All of which points to the motivation of the sources that first . leaked word of its existence being mischievous at best. Because if not quite an Icarus figure . fallen to earth, Humphries reputation has certainly been allowed to . wilt in the heat of the media glare. July 27, 2005, FBI Agent Frederick Humphries . According to the New York Times, . Humphries has a reputation as a 'hard-charging' field agent. It is a . turn of phrase that implies an approach more likely to earn results than . friends. Humphries reportedly received a . dressing down from his superiors when he impatiently tried to push . forward the investigation into the emails received by Kelley. It has been alleged that, frustrated . by what he perceived as a lack of progress, Humphries leaked details of . the probe to the Republicans in Congress, contacting Representative Dave . Reichert in October and asking for his help. In the field: In this April 12, 2007, photo, Frederick Humphries, right, works a scene in Tampa, Florida . Mr Reichert directed him to House . majority leader Eric Cantor, who eventually passed the message onto the . FBI director, Robert S.

Election Day, Mueller went to James Capper, the director of national . intelligence and Petraeus' immediate superior - who urged him to resign . as head of the CIA. In fact, the House Judiciary . Committee has written to Mueller to ask why it took him a week to come . forward with the information that Humphries gave him. This photo taken Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2012 shows the home owned by FBI agent Frederick Humphries in Dover, Florida . This is not the first time Humphries has found himself on the receiving end of his boss's opprobrium. 'Fred is a passionate kind of guy,' said one former colleague. 'He's . kind of an obsessive type. If he locked his teeth onto something, he'd . be a bulldog.' Humphries 'strong sense of right' led him to push forward the investigation that exposed the affair between Broadwell, pictured above at her brother's home in Washington, and Gen Petraeus . It didn't take long for that tenacity . to show. For some who have worked with him it is part of what makes . Humphries 'one of the finest agents there is'. It is coupled with a . strong sense of right - admirable traits but not always the most welcome . combination to those concerned with the subtleties of state and . politics. Humphries studied Criminology at the . University of Tampa and joined the FBI in 1996. Within two years he was . made the case agent in the Rassam Investigation which foiled Ahmed . Ressam's 1999 plan to attack Los Angeles International Airport. The trial judge in that case . repeatedly praised Humphries for his integrity and efforts. But the . agent still managed to fall foul of his bosses for his outspoken . opposition to the decision to turn Ressam over to New York agents. He . felt that the tactic would unravel what trust had been established and . lead to Ressam's co-operation drying up. He was proved right. Having served in Guantanamo Bay . Humphries might have felt himself on safer ground, transferred to the . Tampa Office, but the opposite has proven true twice over. Tampa society was far more dangerous territory than Humphries could have known. Natalie Khawam, Gen. David Petraeus; Scott and Jill Kelley and Holly Petraeus watch the .

Smiling: The US-born actress-turned-photographer, famed for appearing naked in the soft porn film Emily, is accused of taking an oil painting from her former partner . Prince Andrew’s former girlfriend Koo Stark had her trial date for stealing a painting set back because she is due to meet the Dalai Lama, it emerged today. Appearing at Hammersmith Magistrates Court she smiled as she was sent to face trial for allegedly stealing a £40,000 painting from her former partner. The hearing was to set a court date for her trial. Defence barrister Edward Henry requested she not appear until after December 18 because she has a 'longstanding commitment' with the Dalai Lama. He said 'My client has a long-standing religious engagement that requires her to travel abroad. 'She is due to see an emminent person, the Dalai Lama, after November 26th and will be back on December 16th. 'Its a long-standing religious engagement and I wonder if the court would give some consideration to that commitment?' The court then set a date of December 18th for a preliminary hearing at Isleworth Crown Court. Mr Henry asked whether December 21st could be given as he is unavailable on December 18th, but was told the court could not comply with that request. The US-born actress-turned-photographer, 56, famously appeared naked in the erotic film Emily. She is accused of taking the oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape by Dutch master Anthonie Van Borssom from the home of her ex-partner American financier Warren Walker. Looking younger than her years and glamorous in a beige skirt suit, black top and black strappy sandals, she arrived at Hammersmith Magistrates Court in a white Fiat 500, but was forced to drive off after being refused entry to the car park. She then returned on foot and looked happy and relaxed as she entered the building. It is said she arrived at Mr Walker’s Notting Hill home with a bunch of flowers on July 21 and told the housekeeper she was taking two pictures. As the housekeeper went to get a vase Miss Stark is said to have taken a picture off the wall and the pair got in a ‘tug-of-war’ over it, it is alleged. Miss Stark lost when the housekeeper managed to hold on to it but she then ran up the staircase and took another painting before fleeing the property, it is said. Relaxed: Ms Stark looked carefree as she entered court today. It is believed she has requested her trial is after 18 December as she has a 'longstanding commitment' with the Dalai Lama . Miss Stark, whose real name is Kathleen, indicated through her solicitor she ‘strenuously denied’ the charge and was given the painting as a gift by her former lover. Miss Stark will appear at Isleworth Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on 18 December. The photographer was in a relationship with Mr Walker until he jilted her 10 days before their 1997 wedding when she was seven months pregnant with their daughter Tatiana, now 15. The pair have had a tempestuous relationship since and she once threatened to sue him for ‘emotional distress’ after he applied for custody of their daughter when she was 11. She also dated Prince Andrew when he returned from the Falklands conflict in 1981, after they met on a blind date during his leave from the Royal Navy. He took her on holiday to Mustique, she was invited to Balmoral to meet the Royal Family and there were rumours of an engagement. But the romance ended when it emerged she had appeared semi-naked in a raunchy film called Emily in 1976.

Facebook has sparked hysteria among its users by proposing to remove their right to vote on changes to the rules which govern the site. The end to the site's experiment in democracy marks an attempt to gain more control over its own future as it tries to build a robust business model for the future. But many users have reacted with fury, and attempted to protect themselves against changes to Facebook's privacy policy by posting a lengthy - but useless - legal disclaimer on their own profile pages. Users hoping to stop the firm exploiting their data to make money will be disappointed to learn that updating their Facebook status provides no legal protection whatsoever. Rule change: Facebook will no longer allow users to vote on its policies . Outrage: The backlash to the firm's decision is another headache for founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg . Should Facebook end their democratic system which lets users vote on changes to site rules? Since 2009, the web giant has held a vote on any changes to its privacy policies which attract at least 7,000 comments. The referendum then overrides the new policy as long as 30 per cent of Facebook's active users - around 300million people - participate in the vote. But now the company is stepping back from the innovative reform, which was intended to mark it out as a community governed by its users rather than a typical firm focussed only on the bottom line. Facebook issued a statement claiming the voting mechanism 'resulted in a system that incentivized the quantity of comments over their quality'. The site promised to replace the system with a new process offering 'more meaningful feedback and engagement' - but did not elaborate on how they would continue to take the view of users into account. Announcement: Facebook has revealed it is revoking users' right to vote on its privacy policy . Useless: Many users have posted notices like this one on their own profile, but they provide no protection . However, Facebook account-holders hoping to retain their democratic rights have one last chance to stop the change - as nearly 20,000 people have already registered their opposition to the new policy, the site is likely to hold a vote this week or next or whether the change will go through. It will be the third time in the site's history that it has allowed its users to vote on a policy change. The firm insists that even if the right to vote on changes is repealed, it will still consult users on its privacy policies and seek their approval before sharing more of their information with advertisers. But Facebook's assurances are apparently not enough for thousands of its users, who have lashed out at the site. Disaster: The social network has seen its share price slump since its IPO in May . In an attempt to prevent the site from using their data for commercial purposes, many have posted statements such as: 'In response to the new Facebook guidelines I hereby declare that my copyright is attached to all of my personal details, illustrations, paintings, writing, publications, photos and videos, etc. (as a results of the Berner Convention.) 'For commercial use of the above my written consent is needed at all times. (Anyone reading this can copy this text and paste it on their Facebook Wall. This will place them under protection of copyright laws.)' Unfortunately for worried Facebook users, posting that comment has no legal force, and does not overrule the terms of service to which people agree when they start using the site. The mention of the 'Berner Convention' is particularly unhelpful, as there is no such thing - it appears to be an erroneous reference to the Berne Convention which governs the validity of copyright law across national borders. Ultimately, the only way to stop Facebook exploiting your information for commercial gain is to delete all your posts and shut down your account. This latest PR disaster caps off a dismal year for the social network, which launched a much-hyped $100billion IPO in May but has seen its share price slump by a third since then amidst fears it will be unable to convert its runaway popularity into lasting profit.","Site announces it will end three-year experiment in democratic voting .

Repeated claims: Brown believes Princess Margaret gave birth to him in 1955, after an affair . A Jersey accountant who believes he is the secret son of Princess Margaret is renewing his legal battle to 'prove it'. Robert Brown, 57, said he was prepared to pay up to £100,000 to get access to documents relating to her will. Mr Brown, of St Lawrence, Jersey, said he has now appointed solicitors to obtain secret court papers about royal wills drawn up around the time of Margaret's death in 2002. He has appointed the law firm Christian Khan, which prides itself on taking on 'larger organisations, including the state'. Brown claims Princess Margaret gave birth to him in 1955, and he believes his father could be Robin Douglas Home, a Scottish musician who Margaret had a well publicised affair with, the Guardian reports. He died in 1968. Mr Brown believes that the Princess hid the later stages of her pregnancy by using body doubles and that he was sent to Kenya to be brought up as the child of Cynthia and Douglas Brown in Nairobi. He claims the documents will reveal that Buckingham Palace, the attorney general and a senior judge colluded to keep secret her last testament, which he believes contains details of his birth. The case has previously been dismissed by lawyers for the royal family as that of 'a fantasist seeking to feed his private obsession'. But Mr Brown insists he has the right to find out if the Queen's sister is his mother. Records confirm Brown was born on 5 January 1955 in Nairobi, Kenya, but his birth was not registered until 2 February. A privy council meeting was held on the day he was born, a fact Brown believes is important. Later in 1955, Princess Margaret called off her wedding to Peter Townsend. Brown's parents, Cynthia and Douglas Brown, are both now dead, but he said Cynthia had been a model working for Hardy Amies, a designer who the princess was said to be a fan of.Mr Brown told the Guardian: 'I can't get it out of my head that I am right. I can understand people are sceptical because it seems to be childhood fantasy stuff, but it is not like that with me.' He first went to the high court to seek disclosure of her will in 2006 and 2007. 'Parents': Brown believes his father could be Robin Douglas Home (left) and that Princess Margaret (right) kept her secret by using 'body doubles' He lost the case, but Brown is now fighting under freedom of information laws. He said: 'It is constitutionally wholly . inappropriate for the palace and private lawyers with the assistance of . the attorney general to enter into utterly secret formal arrangements, . to reflect Her Majesty's wishes, with senior judges.' A spokesman for the Queen said the palace would not comment on the allegations made by Mr Brown. He said he had long believed he was not his parent's natural son as they were distant compared to the way they treated his supposed siblings. He claims his birthday would sometimes be forgotten altogether, and his birth was not discussed with him. He has also looked into whether he was related to Edward VIII, before considering whether Prince Philip might be his father. Last month, Dominic Grieve, the attorney . general, put an absolute block on the publication . of 27 letters between Prince Charles and ministers, because the letters held the 'most deeply held . personal views and beliefs'.","Robert Brown claims Princess Margaret gave birth to him in 1955 .

A blind pensioner was told by an ambulance service operator she could get to hospital on her own as her guide dog would read the signs. Outraged Alfreda Weir, 64, has had three strokes, kidney failure, heart failure and depends on her 10-year-old guide dog Yoko for getting around. She has to make regular visits to the hospital for treatment and until recently she was regularly picked up by the Scottish Ambulance Service and taken to her appointments. Blind Alfreda Weir, 64, was effectively told that her guide dog Yoko, pictured with her, could read signs and get her to hospital . But after calling the service last week, Ms Weir was informed by an operator that she no longer met criteria and would have to make her own way to the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. Ms Weir, who lives alone in Dunfermline and has no family, was then left speechless when the operator effectively told her that her Labrador could read the hospital signs for her when she got there. She said yesterday: 'When the lady on the phone made it clear the ambulance wouldn’t be taking me for my appointment, I asked her what I would do if I made my own way to the hospital. 'It’s a big place and they use signs to direct patients, but obviously I can’t read them. Ms Weir was trying to get to her appointment at the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, pictured, when the operator refused to provide her with an ambulance . 'She said to me ""there are signs"". So I reminded her that I am visually impaired, to which she replied ""but you’ve got a guide dog"". 'So I had to tell her that my dog can’t read. She’s a lovely, clever little thing but she’s not that clever. I’m not sure if the operator was being rude or just stupid.' As well as being blind, Ms Weir has 26 different medications for conditions such as bronchitis, diabetes and asthma. She has used the patient transport system for years to get to appointments but a new booking system was introduced in October and she was told she no longer met criteria for a lift. Margaret Watt, from the Scottish Patients Association said Alfreda’s treatment was 'Absolutely inhuman'. Ms Weir, pictured at her home with her guide dog Yoko, was left outraged by the Scottish Ambulance Service's refusal to provide her with transport to her hospital appointment . She said: 'I doubt any of the people in the ambulance service would think that was clever if it was one of their relatives. 'What a ridiculous thing to say. That operator should be retrained on respect, compassion and dignity for patients, because she obviously hasn’t got any. 'With regards to Ms Weir not being taken to hospital, that is also not acceptable. Not only is it inconvenient for the patient it costs a lot of money. 'They should be making sure this lady gets to and from hospital safely and has no difficulties in getting around hospitals.' The matter has now been resolved and Alfreda will be picked up by the ambulance again, but she said she is nervous about calling the operator to book up. A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said that they would not comment on specifics of the case because of patient confidentiality, but issued this statement: 'Ambulance transport is provided for patients who have a mobility or medical need. 'The decision to provide transport was based upon the initial information provided by the patient. Once further information and the patient’s circumstances were clarified, transport was confirmed and will continue to be provided in future.'","Alfreda Weir, 64, has 26 medical conditions .

When the invasion began on April 1 1982, Sir Rex made Government House the operational headquarters for the Royal Marines, sending his wife and son away to a safe house, while all servants and domestic staff were told to leave with their most valued possessions. After a fierce battle in which outnumbered Royal Marines shot dead an Argentine navy officer, Sir Rex took the painful decision to surrender.In full gubernatorial uniform, including plumed governor's hat, he went to the town hall in Stanley to meet Admiral Carlos Busser, the Argentine general commanding the invasion.He refused to shake hands with him, and said: 'You have landed unlawfully on British territory and I order you to remove yourself and your troops forthwith.'This is British territory. You're not invited. We don't want you here. I want you to go now and take all your men with you.'Sir Rex also refused to shake hands with the new Argentine governor, General Garcia.

Tragedy: Nicholas Harrison-Longmate, 36, was found dead outside his ex-partner's home after drinking a bottle of vodka . A man found dead outside his ex-partner's home has been camping in the block of flats for weeks in a desperate bid to win her back. Nicholas Harrison-Longmate had inundated former partner Kerry Buchanan with poems, letters, phone calls and text messages after she called time on their five-year romance. When she refused to give in to his attempts to win her back, he began following her around and took to sleeping outside Ms Buchanans flat. He spent nearly a month living there, sometimes on her . neighbour’s balcony or in the corridor of the block of flats, a coroner in Reading, Berkshire said. The 36-year-old's campaign ended tragically when he was found outside her Reading home following a heavy drinking session. Mr Harrison-Longmate has been following Ms Buchanan as she shopped at her local Tesco supermarket and was . regularly spotted drinking beer and bottles of vodka as he lurked . around her block of flats in the weeks prior to his death. The . 6ft 4in Manchester United fan was described by his family as 'a gentle . giant' who was simply 'trying to rekindle a lost love.' The inquest into his death was told that Mr Harrison-Longmate had drunk excessively after the relationship ended and had downed a one litre bottle of vodka on the day of his death this summer. He . sent a series of alarming text messages to Ms Buchanan where he indicated . that he wished to take his own life, some of which were read out during . the inquest on Tuesday. One response sent by Kerry a month before his death, read: ‘I’m sorry but it’s over. Please let me get on with my life.’ Mr Harrison-Longmate was found outside his former girlfriend’s home in Reading, Berkshire on July 29 this year. Paramedics were called but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Detective James Faulkner of Thames Valley Police, confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death. Recording . a verdict of misadventure, Mr Bedford said he could not be sure Mr . Harrison-Longmate intended to take his own life using alcohol, but noted . the ‘tragic circumstances’. Mr Harrison-Longmate’s family was . present at the inquest with his mother Susan, 56, releasing a family . statement which described him as a thoughtful man with a big heart. ‘Nick never meant any harm to anyone. He was a gentle sort, with a huge grin and abundant generosity of heart and assets. ‘A big heart, kind, thoughtful, loving son, brother and grandson.' Broken heart: Mr Harrison-Longmate was desperate to win his ex-girlfriend back and after trying to contact her through letters and phone calls he began following her and sleeping outside her Reading home . The statement read: ‘He never settled in one place for long, either moved job or house, never settling until he met his last girlfriend. ‘He died trying to re-kindle a lost love. He had become besotted with his ex-girlfriend and wanted to marry and start a family. ‘Sadly, this never happened and he leaves a heartbroken family to struggle with this tragic loss. We knew he found happiness, until recently and now hope he has found peace. - Family statement . ‘Nick’s long term girlfriend ended their relationship of five years a short while before his death. ‘He felt utterly betrayed and couldn’t understand, nor accept, this had happened. ‘He never came to terms with this rejection and quickly spiralled downhill to the point where he just sat outside her flat. ‘He did just that on Sunday, 29 July 2012, complete with vodka and energy drinks - and that is where he died. ‘I do not think he set out to end his life that day. His rucksack contained a clean change of clothes, a few snacks and his deodorant and toothbrush. ‘I just think it all became just too much to bear that day.’ A post-mortem examination concluded Mr Harrison-Longmate died from ‘acute alcohol toxicity.’ The inquest was told his liver showed a history of chronic alcoholism, and the toxicity levels in his blood showed 352mg per 100ml of blood - more than four times the drink drive limit. The report concluded that the results show that Mr Harrison-Longmate consumed a very large amount of alcohol prior to his death, adding that more than 300mg could cause loss of consciousness or coma and up to 400mg is lethal.","Nicholas Harrison-Longmate, 36, was found dead outside his ex-partner's home in Reading .

Shoppers have been left outraged after town hall bosses ditched their traditional Christmas tree in favour of  a 'futuristic' £10,000 monstrosity. The towering 21st century ‘tree’ has left people in Ipswich town centre bemused after it appeared this weekend - with one comparing it to 'a load of space-age hamster balls'. The 30ft Christmas decoration includes 41 aluminium spheres covered in more than 40,000 low energy LED lights. The futuristic £10,000 tree looks out of place against the traditional backdrop in the Ipswich market square as Christmas shoppers rush past . The tree is part of a brand new £100,000 Christmas display across the town funded by taxpayers and businesses in Ipswich, Suffolk. The costly display - which includes 250,000 low energy bulbs - was thought up by business bosses in a bid to help attract more shoppers to the town during the festive season. But shoppers have been less than impressed by the tree. Mother-of-two Maggie Bailey, 38, from Ipswich, said: 'It looks like a load of space-age hamster balls rather than a Christmas tree. 'I dread to think how much it has cost but surely Christmas is a time of tradition, so why do they have to have an arty tree? 'Children love to see a Christmas tree with all the decorations on but they are hardly going to get excited about this.'

Paul Clement, chief executive of Ipswich Central, defended his towns controversial futuristic structure saying its now infamous design will help get people talking about the town. He said: 'This is the most talked about tree in East Anglia - probably in the UK this year. “Love it or hate it, everyone is talking about it, and thousands of people are heading into Ipswich to see it and make up their own minds. 'Most other towns would give their right arm to have this amount of conversation about them at this time of year.' But that response didn’t impress traditional shopper Dennis Nedd. He concluded: 'I would have just liked a normal Christmas tree. 'I keep wondering when the real tree and decorations are going to be delivered.' In Herne Bay, Kent, last week pantomime stars Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox were jeered by crowds who were shocked by the 'atrocious' decorations as they tried to turn on the lights. The pathetic tree did not look like it was in the Christmas spirit with merely a handful of lights - leading residents and business leaders to slam it as having the 'worst decorations in Britain'.

It had originally been erected because of 'elf and safety fears that a traditional tree could blow over .

It's always been the goal of humans to scale the highest mountains - but getting down the other side unfortunately doesn't do us any good. Descending the rocky terrain on foot plays havoc with our joints, leading to stress and injury, and it sometimes just isn't worth the effort. Rushing down effortlessly on a mountain bike or other mode of transport is undoubtedly an adrenaline-powered thrill - it's just a case of getting the kit up there. But now, a Dutch company may have come up with the perfect solution. Scroll down for video . New innovation: KOGA has invented an integrated rucksack and scooter to allow mountaineers to easily glide back down the hillside after climbing it . Compact: The Bergmonch folds away into a 9kg rucksack which can easily be carried on the back up any mountain . Fold away: The Bergmonch can be assembled from rucksack to scooter in two minutes . KOGA have invented the Bergmonch, an integrated rucksack and scooter, which allows you to easily glide downhill in either a standing or kneeling position. The manufacturers say the upright riding position and different sized wheels ensure perfect handling and safety as you wind your way down. And the scooter can then be re-packed in just two minutes into a 9kg rucksack which fits comfortably on your back. The company are hoping to appeal to the increasingly young groups of climbers and hikers, saying they have a trendy mode of transport for wheeling downhill which is also unobtrusive when climbing uphill. Gadget: The makers of Bergmonch are hoping to appeal to the increasingly young demographic of hikers and climbers . Quick way down: The scooter can be used in a kneeling or standing position on all kinds of terrain . They point to studies that show 67 per cent of all mountaineers suffer from knee and ankle problems because when walking downhill, our joints have to cope with several times the amount of our own weight. The Bergmonch, which means 'Mountain Monk', can be used on mountain bike tracks and paths, as well as smoother roads. It is perfectly capable of covering large distances effortlessly, KOGA say. Portable but pricey: The Bergmonch will set you back £1,200 . In the long run, the makers hope their product will make Alpine tourism safer and more sustainable by reducing reliance on railways and toboggan runs to transport mountain bikes to the summits. Saving your joints and muscles comes at a price though - the Bergmonch retails at around £1,200.","The Bergmonch is a two-wheeled scooter that folds up into a lightweight backpack you can carry up a mountain .

The attackers also used rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and small arms fire, according to Agence France-Presse. A spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, General Mohammad Zahir Azimi, said none of the militants were able to enter. The NATO military coalition also described it as a failed attack. ‘We can confirm insurgents, including multiple suicide bombers, attacked Jalalabad Airfield this morning. None of the attackers succeeded in breaching the perimeter,’ Lieutenant. Colonel Hagen Messer, a spokesman for the international military coalition, said in an email to the AP. He said that the fighting had ended by mid-morning and that reports showed one member of the Afghan security forces was killed. Several foreign troops were wounded, but Messer did not give any numbers or details. The December 2 attack follows a Taliban suicide bombing that killed 23 people at a Shiite Muslim procession near Pakistan’s capital Islamabad on November 21. NATO, which currently has some 130,000 troops in Afghanistan, is gradually handing security over to Afghan forces ahead of the departure of most combat troops in 2014.

From cinemas to supermarkets, factories to mausoleums, a new book has revealed the deep-seated influence the ancient territory has had on British building design for more than 200 years.

A two-month-old baby boy drowned after his mother suffered an epileptic fit while giving him bath. Tragic Luis Wilmott-Diaz, from Poynton, Cheshire, was discovered face down in a baby bath with his mother Julianna Willmott in a 'confused and disorientated' state by his side. Ms Willmott has no recollection of the event until waking up at Stepping Hill Hospital and discovering her baby son had died. Tragedy: The baby's mother Julianna Willmott woke up in Stepping Hill hospital to be told her boy had died . Speaking at an inquest at Macclesfield Town Hall on Monday, Ms Wilmott, who is originally from Bulgaria, said they were preparing to go to baby yoga. She said: 'I remember taking him to the bathroom and washing his hair. I remember nothing after that. All I remember is being woken up and told I was at Stepping Hill Hospital.' Mum-of-three Julianna, who is aged in her later thirties or early forties, suffers from a form of epilepsy which usually manifests itself in the form of ‘jerks’. She said: 'I was the happiest I’ve ever been in my life. 'I do not understand why something like this could happen. It’s beyond comprehension, it’s inconceivable. 'For the life of me I can’t understand how there was nothing wrong with me one minute and the next minute I’m totally out of it.' The inquest heard that Luis, born on June 1, 2011, died at Stepping Hill Hospital where he was taken by ambulance after being discoveredby family friend Penelope Guest. Mrs Guest, also of Poynton, said: 'I opened the door and heard what I thought was a baby crying or a wail - indescribable noises coming from upstairs. 'I found (Ms Wilmott) on the bathroom floor, it was in total disarray. I looked at Julianna and tried to get some sense out of her. She was sat on the floor rocking and her eyes were rolling back into her head. 'I looked over the side of the bath and saw the baby lying face down.' Dr Anna Richardson, consultant neurologist, said it is likely Julianna suffered an unusually severe epileptic fit, which could have beenaggravated by changes in hormones and medication. She said: 'I think it would be very much in keeping that the behavioural disturbance and subsequent amnesia was due to a prolonged seizure.' Matthew Lyall, forensic pathologist, confirmed drowning was the most likely cause of death in the absence of any other medical evidence. He said: 'Immersion is a reasonable explanation. The fact that the baby was in water is why he has died. How he’s ended up there I can’tsay.' Police officer DS Janet Moor ruled out any criminal activity following an extensive police investigation, and evidence was heard from MsWilmott’s brother Angel Tetrador, friend Susan Marshall, paramedic Graham Harrington and GP Emma Ward. Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, Dr Janet Napier, deputy coroner for Cheshire, said: 'This is an extremely tragic case. Thiswas a very much loved and cherished baby. 'There’s been an extensive police investigation because the only witness in the event was unable to remember anything. We’ve heard the evidence of the neurologist and neuropsychologist and both of them are of the opinion that more likely than not, Julianna suffered an epileptic form of attack at the time which lead to these particularly tragic circumstances.' The family declined to comment.","Tragic Luis Wilmott-Diaz found face down in baby bath .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 07:28 EST, 30 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:15 EST, 30 September 2012 . An Afghan soldier turned his gun on American troops at a checkpoint in the country's east, in a shooting that marked both the continuance of a disturbing trend of insider attacks and the 2,000th U.S. troop death in the long-running war, officials said today. The string of insider attacks is one of the greatest threats to NATO's mission in the country, endangering a partnership key to training up Afghan security forces and withdrawing international troops. Saturday's shooting took place at an Afghan army checkpoint just outside a joint U.S.-Afghan base in Wardak province, said Shahidullah Shahid, a provincial government spokesman. Tragedy: The latest insider attack has marked the 2,000th U.S. troop death in the long-running war in Afghanistan . 'Initial reports indicate that a misunderstanding happened between Afghan army soldiers and American soldiers,' Shahid said. At least two fellow members of Afghanistan's army were also among the dead. He said investigators had been sent to the site to try to figure out what happened. An Afghan official speaking on condition of anonymity said three Afghan soldiers were killed in the clash. It was not clear if the assailant was among the dead. The attack happened about 5pm in Sayd Abad district, Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen Zahir Azimi said in an emailed statement. He did not provide further details, saying he would wait for a report from investigators. Cause for alarm: Insider attacks are taking a toll on the partnership between international and Afghan forces, prompting the U.S. military to restrict operations with small-sized Afghan units . NATO forces announced the assault early Sunday morning, saying only that it was 'suspected insider attack' and that a NATO service member and civilian contractor were killed. One U.S. official confirmed that the service member killed was American, while another confirmed that the civilian was also American. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the nationality of the dead had not yet been formally announced. Afghan soldiers and policemen - or militants in their uniforms - have gunned down more than 50 foreign troops so far this year, eroding the trust between coalition forces and their Afghan partners. Disturbing trend: The so-called 'insider attacks,' which have killed about 50 foreign troops in 2012, are one of NATO's biggest challenges in Afghanistan . An equal number of Afghan policemen and soldiers also died in these attacks, giving them reason as well to be suspicious of possible infiltrators within their ranks. The attacks are taking a toll on the partnership between international and Afghan forces, prompting the U.S. military to restrict operations with small-sized Afghan units earlier this month. The close contact - with coalition forces working side by side with Afghan troops as advisers, mentors and trainers - is a key part of the U.S. strategy for preparing the Afghans to take the lead in security operations as the U.S. and other nations prepare to pull out their last combat troops at the end of 2014, just 27 months away. The number of American military dead reflects an Associated Press count of those members of the armed services killed inside Afghanistan since the U.S.-led invasion on Oct. 7, 2001.","Two Afghan soldiers also killed in 'misunderstanding' between forces .

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 04:20 EST, 29 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:45 EST, 29 November 2012 . A charity raffle organiser who wrote to David Cameron in the hope that the Prime Minister could donate a prize has been left baffled after Downing Street sent back a signed picture. Dementia campaigner Peter Smith is not sure that anyone who buys a ticket for his Christmas Tea Cosy Dementia Cafe raffle will want an autographed photo of the Prime Minister. The 65-year-old from Leeds, West Yorkshire, was initially thrilled when Downing Street agreed to help. Baffled: Peter Smith says that he doesn't know what to do with the signed picture of David Cameron offered by Downing Street as a raffle prize . But rather than send a dinner set or a hamper - the sort of prizes usually on offer as part of the prize draw - he received what he now says will be his 'booby prize'. Peter, who runs the monthly dementia cafe with his 58-year-old wife Elizabeth, said: 'I was honestly shocked when I opened the package and it was a picture of Mr Cameron. 'The gifts we usually have in our raffles are useful prizes - so for the Christmas raffle we've got a TV, a hamper, a three-piece bistro set, a microwave, a trip to Thorpe Park hotel and spa, which would be a great gift for a carer. 'Alongside that, this picture of David Cameron looks a bit like a joke. 'I cannot think of anyone who would actually want it.' Peter said the one pound-a-go raffle, which usually attracts around 60 people, aims to help carers and people with dementia, a condition that can affect memory, understanding and speech. He explained that he wrote to the Prime Minister around six weeks ago inviting Mr Cameron to attend his Christmas raffle. He received a reply on headed notepaper saying due to commitments, the PM would not be able to attend - but added: 'If you have another raffle, please contact us directly and with reasonable notive we may be able to provide a prize.' 'Booby prize': Peter Smith is not sure what to do with the picture of David Cameron, pictured . Excited Peter wrote back telling them the next raffle was a special Christmas event on December 1 - and received the signed picture along with a letter that read: 'The Prime Minister is delighted to provide the enclosed signed photograph which comes with his good wishes for your fundraising.' Peter, who worked in newspaper distribution and with the Alzheimers Society before retiring last year, added: 'I was a bit deflated. I don't know what I was expecting him to send, whether it would be a hamper or whatever, but there seems to be some crossed wires somewhere. 'We make sure all the raffle prizes are something that people who attend the event can use. I think that message might have got a bit lost at Downing Street, so they sent this picture.'So it's a bit of a bizarre prize. I don't really know what to do about it. 'I'd told everyone and they were all really excited to see what Downing Street sent up, so I don't know what they're going to say. 'Usually before the raffle I'll give a bit of a speech and get everyone excited about the prizes we've got on offer, but I honestly don't know what I'm going to say about this. 'I've put it in a frame because it didn't come in one. We're going to have to put our heads together and see what we can make of it.' Peter, who worked for the Alzheimer's Society following his mother Phyllis' battle with the condition, said: 'I wouldn't buy it. I think it's a bit presumptuous as a raffle prize.' A Downing Street spokesman said the gift was 'intended as a gesture of good will'.","Peter Smith, 65, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, wrote to David Cameron asking for a prize for his Christmas fundraiser raffle .

A mother-of-three who suffers from an incredibly rare medical condition has compared herself to comic-book hero the Incredible Hulk after her muscles swelled five stone when it recently flared up. Helen Stephens, 50, who suffers from one-in-a-million Stiff-Person Syndrome, knows that her ailment - which strikes in minutes - could prove deadly. The grandmother from Wednesbury, West Midlands, suffered a major attack earlier this month and saw her weight shoot up a staggering five stone and neck swell by four inches. In pain: Helen Stephens suffers from incredibly rare Stiff-Person Syndrome . She said: 'When I have a bad attack I swell up like the Hulk. 'I look enormous and I even call myself the Hulk, Arnie (Arnold Schwarzenegger) or Rambo. I’m like a bodybuilder.' A seizure could leave her body frozen and permanently swollen if she is not treated in time. She was diagnosed with the syndrome after she began suffering spasms and walking problems after a car accident 14 years ago. Doctors were initially  mystified and she was even branded a hypochondriac as she searched for the answer to her ailments. The syndrome was finally diagnosed in 2004 by the neurology team at Birmingham’s City Hospital. She was put on diazepam to control the stiffness, pain and swelling. But then came the hammer blow - it was terminal. More than a decade on, the condition - which tears her muscles and sets them solid in response to triggers like noise and distress - has taken a terrible toll on Helen’s body. She said: 'My muscles tear at the same time and they increase in mass meaning my weight balloons. 'If I don’t get an injection of diazepam quickly enough my whole body stiffens, leaving me unable to have any treatment because a needle will just snap. 'The symptoms in each person suffering from the condition can differ.' Rare: The condition causes the mother-of-three's body to swell up and she can become 'frozen' if not treated quickly . Stiff-Person Syndrome afflicts twice as many women as men and is often misdiagnosed as a range of conditions, including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. Recalling her battle for a diagnosis, Helen, a former social worker, said: 'I had never heard of this thing. 'But at last I had an answer about what I was suffering from. They believed I had something wrong with me. 'They told me it came in three stages and I was currently in the initial one. But it was terminal. It was devastating.' Over the years, Helen found herself becoming reliant on a wheelchair and the spasms and stiffness began to worsen. She said: 'I had always been a size eight but this has left me at a size 16.' 'I can’t eat properly and am on soft foods. It’s completely ruined my life. 'My body is covered in scar tissues from where the muscles have been torn. I am in constant pain and I have to rely on carers and family to help me. 'I want people out there to know this condition exists because I am constantly met with problems when I am admitted to hospital suffering from an attack. 'Medical staff don’t know what to do because it’s so rare.' Although she carries around a letter alerting medical professionals of her condition and instructing them how to treat her, Helen says that this was ignored by staff at City Hospital, Winson Green when she had her latest attack. Life-changing: Helen, pictured as a child, left, was a petite size eight, right, before she was diagnosed with the condition following a car accident . 'I gave the letter to staff but I was left on a bed for two hours without any treatment,' she said. 'I could have died. My condition means I can die if I don’t have medication injected into me within minutes. 'My throat shuts down and my rib cage contracts, along with my heart, making it difficult to breathe and for blood to be pumped around my body. 'I explained this numerous times but I was left on a bed screaming in agony as everything in my body was ripping apart. 'They needed to get a canula into me so medication could be given on a regular basis to calm my symptoms. 'This had to be done before my muscles hardened and they only had a matter of minutes to do this. 'But it wasn’t until a complaint was made that something was done.' Helen said two carers complained to the patient liaison service, which contacted her former neurologist. Swollen: Helen has said that the condition leaves her looking like the Incredible hulk, pictured, when she suffers an attack . She said: 'He called the A&E department and told them exactly what should be done. But I was as stiff as a rock by the time they put a line inside me. 'I was in unbearable pain and it was by far the worst seizure I have had. I’ve decided to speak out because I have had enough of medical staff not knowing about my condition. 'I cannot complain about the neurology team that has treated me over the years. 'They have been nothing short of brilliant. I was diagnosed by the City Hospital team and the doctors have saved my life on more than one occasion. 'But I cannot understand why the staff in the emergency department do not take notice of what I am saying. I want to raise awareness of this condition so people know about it.' A Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Hospital Trust spokeswoman said: 'The Trust is grateful to Ms Stephens for alerting us to her concerns about her care in the Accident and Emergency Unit. 'We are sorry she is not happy with the care she received. 'We understand she will be providing us with details as part of a formal complaint and, until we have completed the subsequent investigation, we are unable to comment further.'","Helen Stephens, 50, of Wednesbury, West Midlands, was diagnosed with Stiff-Person Syndrome after a car accident .

As the real referees are welcomed back to the NFL with open arms, one of the dismissed replacements has admitted that they may not have been ready for the job. Jerry Frump, a banker from Chicago who has worked in college football for three decades, was one of the most experienced of the replacements. But during an interview published on Friday, Mr Frump questioned the experience of his colleagues as they jumped up from various levels of college football. Scroll down for video . Making the call: With his 30 years in college football Jerry Frump was one of the more experienced replacement referees who took the field during the lockout . When asked by Time magazine if his crew was ready to be officiating at NFL games, Frump said: 'No, I don't think you could say that.' As for moments like the hotly disputed call that had one referee calling touchdown and another calling interception last Monday night, Mr Frump said the NFL was getting what it paid for. He told the magazine: 'We were pawns. This really became a business deal… This was [the NFL's] choice. They chose to take this position in the negotiation with the union.' But despite his lack of NFL experience, Mr Frump accepted what he believed to be the chance of a lifetime. Botched: The referee on the left, Lance Easley, called the play a touchdown for Seattle, even though most fans believe Green Bay had intercepted the ball. The ref on the right called for a stoppage of play . He told Time: 'If I hadn't done it, somebody else would have. We did the best we could.' The league's referees took the field on Thursday night to a standing ovation from fans after the labor dispute was resolved. Also last week, the NFL replacement ref who signaled a touchdown on the final play of Monday night's Packers-Seahawks game said he stands by his controversial decision which allowed the Seahawks to win 14-12. Lance Easley, a banker from California whose controversial decision is believed to be the event that sparked the resolution, is adamant he made the correct call. 'I don’t appreciate the negative stuff,' said Easley, who feels that he’s had to shoulder the blame for Monday night's decision. Scapegoat: Lance Easley claims that he didn't do anything wrong . 'I didn't do anything wrong,' Easley told TMZ. 'Put any other official who knows the rules and they would make the same call.' Easley said the Packers player who allegedly intercepted the ball never had singular possession because, 'You have to not only have the ball but have either two feet or a body part on the ground, and that never happened.' Although the NFL rulebook cites simultaneous possession is awarded to the passing team, Packers cornerback M.D. Jennings clearly came away with the ball prior to Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate, who stripped the ball away as he was tangled with Jennings. Easley, who normally refs at El Camino and Pierce Junior Colleges as well as Occidental, all in Southern California, said the replacement refs did what they were expected to do. 'We did a damn good job... for the most part.' His controversial call followed months of an intense labor lockout between the NFL and NFLRA, who finally came to an eight-year agreement on Thursday morning. The stalemate, which saw the NFL's referees locked out since the beginning for the pre-season, had been whittled down to disagreements over 'a little money.' The real refs returned to the field to officiate Thursday night's game between the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens. Referee Gene Steratore and his seven-man crew received a standing ovation as they walked on the field in their familiar stripes for the first game of Week 4. One fan held up a sign that read: 'Finally! We get to yell at real refs! Welcome back!' 'The other refs just made dumb calls,' said Jessie Riley, a 15-year-old fan wearing an Ed Reed jersey. 'I couldn't stand them. Now we won't get robbed; everything will be fair - hopefully.' The officials ran a mostly smooth and efficient first game back, with no headline-making calls as the Ravens beat the Browns 23-16. Welcome back: A Baltimore Ravens fan holds a sign supporting the return of the real refs prior to the game against the Cleveland Browns . Ready for action: Referee Gene Steratore, right, and back judge Bob Waggoner, left, look around the field before the game between the Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns . NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged that Monday night’s disputed touchdown 'may have pushed the parties further along' in the talks. 'Obviously when you go through something like this it is painful for everybody,' Goodell said. 'Most importantly, it is painful for our fans. We are sorry to have to put our fans through that, but it is something that in the short term you sometimes have to do to make sure you get the right kind of deal for the long term and make sure you continue to grow the game.' The deal is only tentative - it must be ratified by 51 percent of the union's 121 members in a vote scheduled for Friday and Saturday in Dallas. The lockout ended after marathon negotiations produced an eight-year agreement to end the lockout that began in June. However, for the Packers, Redskins, Lions and other teams who voiced their displeasure with calls that might have swayed games, the agreement doesn't change their records. Unwanted fame: Lance Easley gestures on the field following his controversial call in the Seattle Seahawks' 14-12 victory over the Green Bay Packers . The commissioner said he watched Monday night's frenetic Packers-Seahawks finish at home. 'You never want to see a game end like that,' he said. The new agreement will improve officiating in the future, Goodell asserted, reducing mistakes like those made Monday and making the strains of the last three weeks worthwhile. Goodell acknowledged 'you're always worried' about the perception of the league. 'Obviously, this has gotten a lot of attention,' he said. 'It hasn't been positive, and it's something that you have to fight through and get to the long term. ... We always are going to have to work harder to make sure we get people's trust and confidence in us.' The dispute even made its way to the campaign trail, with President Barack Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, calling Thursday 'a great day for America.' 'The president's very pleased that the two sides have come together,' Carney said.","Lance Easley claims he made the right call in Monday night's Packers-Seahawks game .

On the run: Eugene Palmer, pictured, is armed and dangerous in the woods, police believe . A 73-year-old grandfather wanted for the fatal shooting of his daughter-in-law, had previously threatened to kill a Department of Environmental Conservation officer, police said. Eugene Palmer, of Stony point, New York, is on the run after allegedly confronting 39-year-old Tammy Palmer with his shotgun as she returned home from putting her two children on the school bus. Having killed her, he then went on the run, police said, confessing his crime to his sister and fleeing the area. As detectives investigated the brutal . slaying of the young mother, they revealed the sordid details of . Palmer's criminal past and warned that he is believed to be dangerous - . owing to a large gun collection. He was first arrested and charged . with second-degree aggravated harassment after he made repeated 'life . threatening' calls to DEC employee Kenneth Didion’s home over a period . of months starting in December 1984, The Journal News reported. Palmer, working as a truck driver at . the time, pleaded guilty in April 1986 and the next month was sentenced . to one year probation and fined $750. He also was ordered to avoid any . contact with Didion for a year. In this latest case, Palmer is . accused of killing his daughter-in-law, with whom he had a cagey . relationship, on Monday. She was found dead with a bullet wound to her . chest, hours after the attack. According to the paper the first shot of pellets struck her in the arm and she screamed and the second and third struck her in the right side of the chest, killing her. The weapon used in the slaying was found in the yard of her Willow Grove Road home near her body. Dead: Tammy Palmer, pictured right with her two kids, was shot dead on Monday . Tammy Palmer's family said that Eugene Palmer had began a campaign of harassment against her after the 39-year-old took out an order of protection against her estranged husband, John. The order preventing him from the home where she was raising their two children, aged 12 and 16. She lived in a separate house but on the same property as her father-in-law. 'This morning she put the kids on the bus, I think she was hanging clothes,' said the victim’s father John Pannirello. 'He went there, I guess they had an argument. Went to get a gun, killed her.' Eugene Palmer's sister, Elaine Babcock, said he rushed to her house straight after the slaying and admitted what he'd done. 'He just came in and said, 'Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough. 'I . shot and killed Tammy. Give me an hour to get away and then do whatever . you have to do — call the police... whatever you have to do,' and then . he just took off,' Babcock told CBS. Harassed: Tammy Palmer, pictured left, said the man had been harassing her since she separated from his son, John . Mourning: The victim's mother, Violet Pannirello, pictured, said she didn't think Mr Palmer would kill her daughter . School: Palmer, pictured, had just dropped her kids at the school bus when she was shot dead . The woman said she immediately called police, who believe he fled into Harriman State Park, which backs on to his property. Search teams spent Monday hunting the woods for the man, a retired park ranger, and were using tracking dogs and helicopters to help them. On Tuesday they discovered his vehicle, a 1995 green Dodge Ram pickup truck, shortly after 1pm, and remain confident he is somewhere in the park. Tammy Palmer's parents are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their daughter, and are fighting to take custody of her two children. They say her relationship with her father-in-law had grown increasingly ugly, culminating in a fight last week. But they never thought the man would end her life. Crime scene: Palmer's body was found with a shotgun nearby at her home, pictured . 'She told me 'Mommy, don’t worry I’ll be alright.' I don’t think she ever thought that this man would kill her,' Tammy's mother Violet Pannirello told CBS. 'She’s gone. She’s resting. She’s not scared anymore. It’s so sad,' Pannirello said, adding 'a part of me died today.'","New York Mother-of-two Tammy Palmer, 39, shot dead on Monday .

A knifeman who stabbed four police officers in a butcher's shop using a stolen meat cleaver was heard chanting ‘God help me to kill my enemies’ moments before the attack. Christopher Haughton, 33, was described as ‘acting very strangely’ prior to the attack by a the first police officer who arrived at the scene, a court heard today. PC Stephen Barker was responding to a call about a man shouting in the street in Kingsbury, northwest London and spotted Mr Haughton screaming at a block of flats. Attack: Police have cordoned off the scene as medical supplies is seen strewn across the road in Kingsbury, northwest London at the time of the stabbings . He told the Old Bailey: He was obviously causing concern to members of the public. ‘Once we got a little bit closer, we worked out what he was saying: “God help me to kill my enemies.” ‘I tried to speak to Mr Haughton, but I got no response. I asked him his name, and he replied: “You don’t need my name - I’m just f***ing angry”. ‘He ignored me, and continued to shout as before, about killing his “enemies”. ‘In a vain attempt to calm the situation, I tapped him gently on his left shoulder, and said “calm down, tell me what the matter is”.’ Responding immediately, the paranoid schizophrenic clenched his fist and threw a punch towards PC Barker, jurors heard. Evidence: PC Stephen Barker, seen arriving at the Old Bailey today, said Christopher Haughton bit him and tore his sleeve off with his teeth . The two officers then grappled with him . as they tried to make an arrest, but were thrown off by the ‘unusually . strong’ paranoid schizophrenic. PC Barker said: ‘He put his head down - I initially thought he was trying to struggle free - but he was biting my left arm. ‘It took a few seconds to acknowledge the fact he was biting me, and then it was searing pain - enough for me to let go. ‘When I pulled my jacket away, it firmly remained within Mr Haughton’s jaws, and he ripped the sleeve off.’ The two officers had been called to the scene outside a hairdressers in Kenton Road at around 9am on November 19 last year - some 300 metres from the butchers shop where their colleagues were later stabbed. Both men then drew their batons, before calling for backup and making another unsuccessful attempt to detain Haughton. Minutes later, in CCTV footage shown to the jury, the knifeman can be seen storming into Kingsbury Road Halal Butchers, pursued by a group of police officers. In the recording, taken outside from a camera in the street, members of the public can be seen massing outside the butchers as the alleged attacks take place. Previous attack: Mr Haughton allegedly bit WPC Vicky Vincent in her thigh drawing blood and spat blood into WPC Alison Spruce’s face when they visited his home following a noise complaint . After a short pause, police can be . seen running from the building, with an injured officer being dragged . out by his desperate colleagues. Mr Haughton had grabbed a fillet knife from the butcher’s shop and launched an attack on the police officers, it was said. After officers managed to subdue him, he shouted ‘Kill me, kill me, I want to die. I want to come back as Freddie Kruger.’ He . added ‘F*****g pigs, I hope you all die, and all your children die,’ as . he chanted and hurled Caribbean insults, such as ‘you bumbaclat’. When . formally arrested at the police station, he replied: ‘You can f*****g . put me in jail for life. I want to kill you all, I’ll kill more of you . next time.’ He then said: ‘I curse all of you, I hope those officers die,’ ‘I’m Lucifer, you all have Aids now,’ and ‘I have Aids, I love giving women Aids. I hope you all get Aids.’ It was alleged that as police tried to put Haughton into handcuffs he attempted to stab another officer in the neck . Prosecutor . Edward Brown QC said: 'Some of the officers suffered very significant . injuries indeed, all the result of this defendant’s violence. 'It was perhaps only a matter of very good fortune that some of the police officers escaped with their lives.' One . officer PC Thomas Harding tried to pin him down with a riot shield but . Haughton managed to straddle him and stabbed the officer in the stomach, . it was said. As another . officer PC Alastair Hinchliff tried to restrain him, he too fell to the . floor and Haughton, it was said, slashed him across the left side of his face from . temple to ear with the knife penetrating his cheek into the mouth. He . then stabbed PC Hinchliff in the upper and lower arm exposing the . muscle and tendons of the arm as other officers struck him with their . batons with no effect, it was claimed. As they did this Haughton lashed out twice cutting across PC Andre Robb’s knee causing a 15 cm wound, Mr Brown said. The . Old Bailey heard 'despite his continued violence, officers were able to . pin the defendant against the meat display counter, with his head . forced downwards.' Before launching his alleged attack, Haughton went into a butcher's shop where he took a fillet knife, it was claimed in court . But as they tried to cuff him, Haughton attempted to stab PC Shaun Haque in the neck but an officer managed to grab his wrists and the blade stopped just millimetres away. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC said: 'The scene was a dreadful one - officers very badly injured, some critically so and blood everywhere from their injuries, with police and ambulance personnel doing what they could to give first aid to the officers before they were rushed to hospital. 'Uninjured officers succeeded in handcuffing the defendant, placing him in leg restraints and he was taken to a police van. 'Three officers remained in the back of the van to ensure both the safety of the defendant and to control him. He continued to be violent and aggressive even when restrained.' Haughton was on bail when he went on the rampage and 'it demonstrates how his hostility towards the police was not something that arose just on the morning of 19th November. 'It will become plain during the evidence that the defendant was in a disturbed state of mind at the time. In the months that followed he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.' But he added Haughton had the intention to kill the police officers as he had 'called out that he wanted to kill the police who were there, and threatened to do so,' and 'he hoped that the police whom he had injured were going to die. 'His actions were of course determined, dreadful and carried out in real anger, directed at the officers who were trying to detain him. ‘ . Haughton denies assault causing actual bodily harm to PC Alison Spruce in an earlier attack in Streatham on October 9, and also denies the attempted murder of PCs Thomas Harding, Alastair Hinchliff, Andrew Robb and Sham Haque and alternative counts of wounding each with intent. He further denies causing actual bodily harm to PCs John Charlton and Barker, and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to Sgt. David Weir. The trial continues.

At first glance these beautiful images appear to show a frozen river caked in fresh snow. But these photographs actually reveal the shocking extent of pollution of the Yamuna River in India that has caused a thick layer of foam to completely cover it. Parts of the Yamuna are now described as a 'dead river' meaning the pollution level is so bad that there is not enough oxygen in it for fish or other marine life to survive. Scroll down for video . Taking a bubble bath: A Hindu devotee offers prayers after a dip in the Yamuna River, surrounded by industrial waste, during the religious Karthik Purnima ceremony in New Delhi, India . Diving in: This Hindu doesn't seem to mind the foam caused by industrial and residential waste . Taking a dip: Hindus traditionally bath rivers to offer their prayers as part of the Kartik Poornima ceremony . But that didn't stop one devoted Hindu going for an industrial bubble bath to mark the Karthik Purnima religious ceremony celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu calendar month of Karthik. Other worshippers can be seen making their way through the foam on small wooden boats or carrying out prayers by the water's edge. The images show poor water quality of the Yamuna despite efforts by the Indian government to rectify the situation. India has spent almost £200 million on unsuccessful schemes to clean the river, which is revered by Hindus and still plays an important role in many religious ceremonies. Most of the pollution is centered around Delhi where 18 drains dump 600 million gallons of sewage in the river every year. As well as industrial waste from local factories, locals also wash their clothes and utensils in the river. Field of ice: At first glance, it appears these Hindus are crossing a frozen river . Steady now: Worshipers make their way to shore after travelling across the foam-coated Yamuna river . Fireside: Groups of Hindus light candles and small fires by the side of the river as part of the ceremony . A 600km stretch of the river surrounding Delhi has been declared dead - similar to the Thames 55 years ago before efforts were made to clean it up. The Yamuna's polluted stretch was about 500km - from Wazirabad in Delhi to Juhika in Uttar Pradesh - according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)'s 2010 data. But latest data show the pollution now starts from Panipat in Haryana, almost 100km upstream of Wazirabad. Scientists have also recently raised concerns about the risks of the river infecting food produce grown nearby with an insecticide called Lindane, widely used in mosquito repellents. If not washed properly before being cooked, the chemical can remain in the vegetables and fruits grown on the river's floodplains and enter the human body. Residents of settlements along the river who use the contaminated water for washing, cooking, bathing and drinking, continue to be susceptible to diseases.

Leila Johnston, 33, spent her childhood in Gourock, Inverclyde, playing with IBM components . When Leila Johnston was growing up she knew she was different from her friends. While their bedroom walls were plastered with the latest popstars, hers was covered with a giant picture of the nearby IBM building. While they played with dolls and Lego, she played with IBM computer components brought home from the nearby Inverclyde plant by friends and family. Yes, Leila, 33, is a self-confessed IBM addict. And proud. Her obsession with the American technology company is such that she has spent the last year tracking down IBM tills in shops, cafes and pharmacists and posting them online. She was even given the chance to bring her strange obsession to a live audience when she was asked to speak at the annual Boring Festival in London earlier this month. She opened her address with: 'I know I’ll never be able to get them all, but I’ve found I can’t stop. 'It’s as though the logo sings out to me. IBM tills are a beacon of . research and intelligence hidden in the plain sight of consumerism' When she spots an IBM till she takes a picture, plots its location and uploads it to her blog, for other IBM fanatics out there who appreciate the technology's beauty. Paying for your coffee will never be the same again: IBM on display in London's coffee bars Paul (left) and Starbucks (right). Leila has spent the last year taking pictures of IBM cash registers all over the country . Just stunning: IBM's tills ringing and singing in Boots (left) and HMV (right).

'It sounds… unusual, I realise, but I . believe it’s no stranger than bird watching or trainspotting. I’ve . found an elusive thin-client series 300 and the almost-unheard-of series . 700.' For those reading this and interested in . joining Leila in capturing on camera IBM tills across Britain, it's not as simple as it sounds. On her blog she lists 'The Golden Rules of IBM Spotting' ('because the public can’t really be relied upon for these kinds of projects, I came up with some rules') she outlines the process to which 'spotters' must adhere. 'IBM logo must be clearly visible in the photo and you must photograph exactly as you find it. Do not interfere with the scene', she writes. If an IBM spotter ever has the rare fortune of stumbling across more than one piece of IBM equipment in the one shot, they are advised 'to email me immediately' because 'it's quite rare to find a full set in the wild', she says. Leila, who now lives in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, added: 'I think it’d be unhealthy to take it too seriously, but the history of IBM is genuinely interesting, and as a company they are as worthy of our interest as Apple or Microsoft. But they have become invisible over the years. 'They are no longer associated with great technical achievement when I think they really ought to be. They invented the first PC after all.' Amazingly, the 45 photos she posted on her finalbullet.com blog have attracted thousands of visitors from all over the world. Guess where: Boots in London (left) and Asda in Sheffield (right).

Cobbled together from just an old motorbike, plywood and some pieces of plastic, Chinese farmer Zhang Xuelin was convinced that he could take his aircraft into the skies. But as an expectant crowd gathered to watch him set off on his maiden flight, Mr Xuelin's aircraft - perhaps unsurprisingly - threw a wobbler. He emerged from the plane after the botched attempt with badly-scratched legs. But Zhang's confidence had not been dented by the experience. Pride and joy: Zhang Xuelin has studied aircraft since he dropped out of school as a 12-year-old . Rocket man: The farmer inspects the aircraft that he constructed for only £200 using plywood, an old motorbike and old pieces of plastic . Does that go there: Zhang said it is his 'dream' to take to the skies in his aircraft . The aspiring aviator told onlookers: 'How could I forget to adjust the throttle . in the air? And the tail is way too big, which made the plane . impossible to balance and made the nose go down. But I will fix it next . time.' Having dreamt of flying a plane since he dropped out of school as a 12-year-old child, Mr Xuelin decided to act on his dream, constructing the aircraft over the past 11 months. After hours of toil, Mr Xuelin finally finished the vehicle earlier this month. It measures 3.4 metres and weights over 230 kilograms. The aircraft could be considered a low-cost investment for the farmer - after he spent only 2,000 yuan (£200) on its construction. A crowd of locals gathered around the aircraft in Jinan, Shandong province, for its first attempted takeoff. Using a main road as a runway, they gave Mr Xuelin a push as he sought to gain momentum. After two hours of trying, the . enthusiast was forced to give up. His determination to soar into the . skies though is as strong as ever. He said: 'It's my dream, better than playing cards.' Mr Xuelin can take inspiration from another amateur aviator from Hunan province who flew a hand-crafted aircraft in 2008 after spending six years building it. Ready for takeoff: Onlookers give Mr Xuelin's plane a push as he attempts to take off for the first time using a main road as a runway .

Everyone likes a little pampering from time to time and this 40 stone, 7ft tall brown bear is no exception. Having emerged from a swamp in Finland, he decided to treat himself to a special spa treatment, using only the most natural materials. Still dripping with water, he exfoliated by scratching his back against the bark of a pine tree, then indulged in a facial, scrubbing away with leaves in his paws. That's the spot: The brown bear was dripping with water as it scrubbed its back on the tree trunk . After that revitalising experience, he no doubt felt considerably less grizzly than when he arrived. The European brown bear's al-fresco ablutions were captured on camera by photographer Marko Koenig, who witnessed the scene from his position in a hide in Suomussalmi, in the Kainuu region of Finland. 'The bear was scratching his back and marking his territory against a pine,' the 38-year-old said. 'He was having a good scrub for a few minutes near the swamp. I have never seen this before.'

The Army private charged in the biggest security breach in U.S. history took the stand Thursday at a military hearing about what he contends was needlessly harsh treatment at a Marine Corps brig. Private First Class Bradley Manning testified on the third day of a pretrial hearing at Fort Meade, outside Baltimore saying that he lost all hope when he was detained for weeks in a segregation tent in Camp Arifjan, an Army installation in Kuwait where he was stationed. Manning says he remembers thinking 'I'm going to die, I'm stuck inside this cage.' His turn on the stand: Bradley Manning seen arriving at a courthouse at military base Fort Meade, Maryland where he will testify about the treatment he received during his two-years in prison . The noose: This artist rendering shows Army Pfc. Bradley Manning being shown a bedsheet as he testified in his pretrial Wikileaks hearing . Wearing his dress uniform, he appeared nervous, stuttering over his words as he tried to answer questions from a defense attorney about his arrest in Baghdad in May 2010. He was testifying only about his arrest and confinement and not about how he leaked classified documents to Wikileaks. Seated in the witness booth, he swiveled back and forth and gestured with his hands as he described the layout of his confinement quarters overseas. 'I was in a pretty stressed situation...I was getting very little information' from his attorney while he was being held, he said, noting that he felt increasingly ‘hopeless’. 'I had pretty much given up. My world had just shrunk,' Manning said, explaining how he had suicidal thoughts while being held by authorities. Manning is trying to avoid trial in the WikiLeaks case by arguing he was punished enough when he was locked up alone in a small cell for nearly nine months at a brig in Quantico, Virginia, and had to sleep naked for several nights. 'I totally started to fall apart,' the 24-year-old said. The military contends the treatment was proper, given Manning's classification then as a maximum-security detainee who posed a risk of injury to himself or others. Goal: Manning is trying to avoid trial in the WikiLeaks case by arguing he was punished enough when he was locked up alone in a small cell for nearly nine months at a brig in Quantico, Virginia, and had to sleep naked for several nights . Earlier Thursday, a military judge accepted the terms under which Manning would plead guilty to eight charges for sending classified documents to the secret-spilling WikiLeaks website. Colonel Denise Lind's ruling doesn't mean the pleas have been formally accepted. That could happen in December. But Lind approved the language of the offenses to which Manning would admit. She said those offenses carry a total maximum prison term of 16 years. Manning made the offer as a way of accepting responsibility for the leak. Smile: Manning was decidedly more excited when he appeared in court for the first time on Tuesday (pictured) Controversial: Supporters stood outside the Maryland military courthouse where he was due to appear Tuesday . Make or break: If a judge rules he was tortured then the entire trial could be abandoned, though that is not expected to happen . Government officials have not said whether they would continue prosecuting him for the other 14 counts he faces, including aiding the enemy. That offense carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Under the proposal, Manning would admit to willfully sending the following material: a battlefield video file, some classified memos, more than 20 Iraq war logs, more than 20 Afghanistan war logs and other classified materials. He would also plead guilty to wrongfully storing classified information. Meanwhile, Manning's lawyers are arguing that the charges against the soldier should be dismissed because of how he was treated while confined at Quantico. Other prospective witnesses include a military psychiatrist who examined Manning at Quantico, and the former commander of the confinement facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Manning was later moved there, re-evaluated and given a medium-security classification.","Wikileaks informant testified about the treatment he received both in Kuwait holding area and once he returned to Virginia in the U.S.

A drug addict who battered her war hero neighbour to death so she could profit from his will was jailed for life yesterday. Charlotte Frazier-Doody beat 92-year-old William Davis around the head with what is believed to have been a saucepan after tricking her way into his home by bringing him a meal. Mr Davis, who won nine medals for his Royal Navy service in the Second World War, was found alive by neighbours in his bloodstained terraced home. Jailed for life: Charlotte Frazier-Doody (right) was today given a life sentence the brutal beating death of William Davis (pictured left during his days in the navy), who was found in his house, lying in a pool of blood . Despite horrific injuries, he managed to survive for another three hours before dying in hospital. The court was told Frazier-Doody, 36, . who lived opposite and claimed to look out for the widower, continued to . attack him as he lay on the floor. The heroin user had been heard boasting about how she would benefit from Mr Davis’s will. ‘The only conceivable explanation for . the violence is that she wanted money and that led to violence,’ said . Peter Grieves-Smith, prosecuting. ‘If there be another explanation we . haven’t heard it, and in our submission it is a safe and sound inference . from all the evidence. ‘Violence against a man she knew to be . elderly and physically frail, violence in his own home. He was attacked . in his back room. Experts believe the blows were delivered when he was . lying on the ground, defenceless.’ 'Defenceless': A police tent set up at the murder scene in April this year in which Frazier-Doody had attacked him as he lay 'defenceless' on the floor of his home, the court heard . War hero: During his time in the Royal Navy (right) he was awarded nine medals (pictured left making a toast at his daughter's wedding) and was described as a 'proud and independent man' Frazier-Doody had denied murder but . yesterday a jury of three men and nine women took five hours to return a . unanimous guilty verdict at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Judge John Warner ordered her to serve a minimum of 20 years behind bars. ‘Only two people know the true . circumstances of what happened on that day and why he came to be . murdered and one of them is no longer with us,’ he told Frazier-Doody. ‘In what should have been the safety . and security of his own home, he was savagely beaten to death by you, . one of his neighbours, and that involved the use of some kind of . substantial object. ‘He suffered many blows to his head . and it is clear that he was either attacked when on the floor or the . attack continued when he fell on the floor. Her DNA: Police forensics search for evidence. A clump of hair, which appeared to have been ripped out from the roots, found at the murder scene matched Frazier-Doody's DNA . ‘He also clearly tried to protect . himself judging by the injuries to his arms and forearms. He was . obviously desperately grabbing your hair and he pulled out a clump of . it. ‘But clearly he was no match for you . and whatever weapon you were using. The motive for this frenzied attack . remains a mystery and will continue to be so unless you decide to say at . some stage what actually happened and why.’ Caught on camera: Frazier-Doody was seen on CCTV driving her moped towards Mr Davis's house shortly before the murder . Mr Grieves-Smith told the court the veteran’s family were still mourning the loss of a ‘proud and independent man’. In a bid to cover up her crime on . April 1, Frazier-Doody tried to get rid of her bloodied clothes by . dumping them in a friend’s rubbish bin. The court heard the clump of her hair was found in the room next to Mr Davis’s body. DNA taken from splatters of blood on . the kitchen sink also matched hers and specks of his blood was found on . her jeans and her moped when she was arrested two days later. The jury was told that the back room of Mr Davis’s semi-detached home in Willenhall, West Midlands, was covered in blood. Mr Grieves-Smith said CCTV cameras caught Frazier-Doody driving her moped towards the house shortly before the murder. Nothing except a set of saucepans was missing from his home and his wallet – containing £280 – was still in his pocket. Mr Davis, who had two children, four . grandchildren and one great grandchild, worked as a locksmith after . leaving the Navy where he had  served in Japan, Malta and Dunkirk. His . wife, Clara, died in 2006. Speaking after the case, Martin . Lindop, of West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘William Davis . was a war veteran who had served his country with great courage and . pride. ‘He was extremely independent, but his . neighbours would always assist him when he needed any help. To this . extent, he trusted those around him.’ He added: ‘We do not know what motivated Charlotte Frazier-Doody to kill Mr Davis. ‘She was addicted to heroin and crack cocaine. However, she has never told the truth about what happened.’","Charlotte Frazier-Doody beat William Davis, 92, with a 'heavy object'

"By . Hugo Duncan . PUBLISHED: . 19:11 EST, 29 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:56 EST, 30 November 2012 . Sir Mervyn King said banks need to raise £60billion to protect against future losses . British banks are not as strong as they claim and could need to raise as much as £60billion of emergency funds to protect against future losses, the Bank of England warned yesterday. Its governor, Sir Mervyn King, said the black hole at the heart of the banking system was ‘holding back our recovery’ and must be tackled ‘head on’. The Bank blamed the shortfall on hidden losses on toxic loans, the mounting bill from mis-selling scandals, and ‘misleading’ accounting by the country’s biggest lenders – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC. The cost of the payment protection insurance debacle – already £11.1billion – could almost double. The damning assessment came in the half-yearly financial stability report by the Bank’s new financial policy committee, set up to monitor the health of the banking system. It ordered an audit into the true state of banks’ finances and called for lenders to raise new funds or restructure their businesses where necessary to bolster confidence in the industry. In a warning shot ahead of this year’s bonus round, the Bank said bankers’ pay should reflect this. The report raised concerns that the Government could be forced to pump yet more funds into RBS and Lloyds, the part-nationalised lenders already propped up with £66billion of taxpayers’ money. Sir Mervyn said the issue ‘does warrant immediate action’ – in the form of an investigation by the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog – but added that it was ‘manageable’ and played down the prospect of another state bailout. Warning: The Bank of England (building pictured) blamed the shortfall on hidden losses on toxic loans . However, the report piled pressure on . Britain’s troubled banks as they struggle to repair their battered . balance sheets at the same time as lending to households and businesses. Sir Mervyn, who will be replaced by . Canadian Mark Carney at the end of next June, said sentiment in the . financial markets ‘has improved a little’ since the summer but added: . ‘We continue to face an exceptionally challenging environment.’ The . governor said UK banks have reported ‘substantial’ cash buffers, . exceeding the minimum level required by regulators. He . warned, however, that there were ‘good reasons’ to think the cash . buffers lenders claim to have ‘do not in fact provide an accurate . picture of banks’ health’. The . report said banks could face another £15billion of losses on toxic . loans made to households in Britain and businesses in the crumbling . eurozone. It also said banks have ‘underestimated and underprovisioned’ for the costs relating to scandals such as the mis-selling of PPI and the Libor interest rate rigging scandal. Although banks have already set aside £13billion – including £11.1billion for PPI – another £10billion could be needed as costs escalate. The report by the Bank of England said that HSBC (pictured), Barclays, Lloyds and Barclays would need another £5billion to £35billion . The report added that –HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and Barclays – would need another £5billion to £35billion because of ‘aggressive’ bookkeeping involving ‘complex and opaque’ techniques. It said these factors meant banks’ ability to ‘cushion losses and maintain the supply of credit are not as great’ as implied. Sir Mervyn said: ‘The choice we face is to tackle the situation head on, or to suffer a prolonged period of adjustment in which an inadequately capitalised banking system holds back recovery in the wider economy.’","Sir Mervyn King said the black hole was 'holding back our recovery'

Cleared: PC David Hair was found not guilty of using racist language after he admitted asking a black female colleague if she was 'going home to cook bananas'. He claimed it was an honest reference to cooking . Two police officers were cleared of racial harassment today after one admitted saying a black man looked like a monkey while another allegedly told a black colleague that she was 'going home to cook bananas'. Metropolitan Police constables Kevin Hughes, 36, and Pc David Hair, 42, were both found not guilty on two separate charges each at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court. PC Kevin Hughes, 42, was patrolling the East End of London in a squad . car when he made the remark about a black man looking like a monkey to colleague PC Costas Dakoutros. When challenged by PC Dakoutros, Hughes said ‘It’s true’ and added: . ‘They’re closely related to chimpanzees and more closely related to . Neanderthals.’ During the same patrol another workmate, PC Kirk Baker, heard Hughes . say: ‘Black people haven’t evolved, they live in mud huts in Africa.’ He went on to say that black people’s ‘sticking out ears and thick lips’ made them resemble primates. Prosecutors claimed the case revealed a culture of racism in the Victim . Offenders Location Time (VOLT) team which was based in Newham, one of . the most ethnically diverse areas of the country. But Hughes, along with PC David Hair, 36, a fellow member of the VOLT . team, was cleared of a public order offence and racially aggravated . harassment. Hughes wept as District Judge Howard Riddle announced the verdicts at . Westminster Magistrates’ Court, while Hair signed with relief. But today a police watchdog urged the Met to still consider taking legal action against the officers. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Scotland Yard should 'seriously consider' its findings in relation to the case. IPCC commissioner Mike Franklin said: 'The IPCC’s investigation into alleged racist comments made by Pcs Hughes and Hair concluded in June when we passed our findings of potential gross misconduct to the Metropolitan Police Service for their consideration. 'I urge the Metropolitan Police Service to give serious consideration to the issues raised in our report. 'Any misconduct hearing will need to determine whether the comments are a breach of the professional standards expected of police officers.' Hair was alleged to have racially abused PC Julia Dacres while travelling in a police minibus last March 13. He asked her if she was going to do some overtime and then said: ‘I . didn’t know if you were going to go into a little rant and say how you . had to go home and cook bananas’. Hughes would also talk in a mock-Asian accent call other officers ‘auntie’ and ‘uncle’. He thought it was hilarious because he had dealt with Asian man who said . he was ‘visiting his aunty for a party’ in a very thick accent. Witnesses: Hair was alleged to have racially abused PC Julia Dacres, right. PC Kevin Hughes, 42,  made the remark about a black man looking like a monkey to colleague PC Costas Dakoutros, left . He admitted he had referred to the men’s similarities to monkeys but . said it was during an innocent conversation about evolution and had . nothing to do with his race. ‘I just said it has nothing to do with him being black, I noticed him . because he had elongated limbs, his gait,’ Hughes told the court. Relief: PC Kevin Hughes arriving at Westminster Magistrates Court yesterday where he was cleared of threatening, abusive words or behaviour . ‘I said that was why I picked him out, because of the way he was walking - it was a fleeting glance. ‘I was just trying to reinforce my point that I believe that some human beings had characteristics that resemble monkeys.’ Hair admitted making the bananas comment, but denied that it was racially motivated. He told the court: 'I could've used any food but I'm aware that bananas are something that are cooked, sometimes as fritters. 'Unfortunately for me, I'm now aware that they are called plantain. 'As far as I'm aware a banana is a banana.' Senior District Judge Howard Riddle said: 'Whatever precisely Pc Hughes said, it was unacceptable and offensive.' He said that 'in these circumstances it did not amount to a criminal offence'. Noting that 'context is central', Mr Riddle pointed out there had been no aggression or threat. He said: 'Freedom of speech is a cherished principle. Freedom of speech includes the freedom to be offensive. 'It . is, of course, restrained in a number of ways - employers can require . employees to avoid offensive language or lose their jobs. The civil . courts can provide redress for harm caused. 'But when the state tells people . what they can or cannot say, on pain of criminal sanction, the position . is different. 'Citizens expect strong justification for curtailing . freedom of expression. Offensiveness is not enough. Context is central.'

Jailed: Emily Goode stabbed a university student in the back while performing a sex act on him during a one-night stand . A woman who stabbed a university student in the back while performing a sex act on him during a one-night stand has been jailed today. Emily Goode met student Josh Nock in Lloyds Bar, Stourbridge, in October last year. After spending time talking to Goode, Mr Nock - who thought she was friendly and flirty - decided to go back to her home in Brierley Hill. Once they got inside the house, Mr Nock was invited to sit on a sofa as she undressed. Goode, 28, then reached for a knife, the court heard, and began running the blade up and down the student’s chest. Richard Franck, prosecuting, said: 'Things . started to turn rather strange. They were sitting on the sofa and he . said in his statement that she came on quite strongly.' Mr Franck said that the pair got undressed and started to engage in sexual activities. He added: 'There was a knife on the table next to the sofa and she picked it up. 'She started running the blade up and . down his chest and torso, softly at first. He said she said ""It turns . me on, trust me, I won’t hurt you"".' Goode put the knife down for a short time before picking it back up again. Mr Franck told the court: 'She then inflicted a deep scratch on his front which he said did hurt. 'He then shouted at her that she was a psycho, but she begged him not to leave. 'Goode started to perform oral sex on Mr Nock before telling him to turn around and face the wall.'She then stabbed him twice to the back through his shirt.' The victim, who had to take pain-killers for three weeks, was not immediately aware that he had been stabbed, but managed to escape from the rear of Goode’s house after finding the front door locked. He alerted police shortly after 4am and Goode was arrested at 6.21am. Attack: Goode took Mr Nock to her house in Brierley Hill, West Midlands, after meeting him in Lloyds Bar in Stourbridge, pictured . But when officers arrived to take his . statement they arrested him after Goode also called 999 and claimed she . was the victim of a sexual assault. Goode later admitted to detectives she had made up the rape allegation. Offering mitigation, defence barrister Simon Rippon said he had never encountered an offence that included the kind of detail which surrounded the stabbing. 'Very plainly, she wasn’t thinking straight,' said Mr Rippon, who submitted that alcohol and cocaine abuse had been symptoms of an underlying psychiatric problem. Goode was also sentenced for injuring a policeman with a shard of pottery during an incident in  Amblecote, Stourbridge, in May. Goode, who admitted two counts of wounding, was told by Judge John Warner: 'There came a time when you stabbed this man twice in the back - that’s obviously a very serious thing to do. 'Sometimes that sort of act can cause immense injury.' Jailing her for 27 months, Judge John Warner told Goode: '[Your barrister] on your behalf said the circumstances of this offence were unique. 'I can say, sitting here as I have done for many years, that they are unique in my experience as well. 'I won’t dwell on the circumstances that led up to the actual act of violence because that’s already been well set out. 'But the long and short of it are that there came a time when you stabbed this man twice in the back and that is obviously a very serious thing to do. 'Sometimes that sort of act can cause immense injury, albeit when that’s not intended. 'Fortunately his injuries were not as serious as they might have been.'","Emily Goode met student Josh Nock in a Lloyds Bar .

Car makers around the world have, for decades, regarded the appropriate place to put airbags as on the inside of their vehicles. Now a team of Japanese researchers have turned that received knowledge on its head with their latest invention - an electric car covered in cushions. Humanix, a startup business affiliated with Hiroshima University, has recently revealed the golf cart-like vehicle, which is covered in airbag-like cushions that spring back into shape after absorbing impacts. iSAVE YOU: The Japanese-designed electric car turns received wisdom about airbags on its head by putting shock absorbing cushions all around the outside of the vehicle . Mmm, soft: A man tests out the cushioning with his hand . The company, formed by researchers from the university, is set to bring the innovative vehicle to market - dubbed iSAVE YOU - for a mere 790,000 yen (about £6,000). Professor Tsutomu Masujima, president of Humanix, told Japanese magazine Sponichi Annex: 'The car will be perfect for our rapidly ageing society and we've already has many enquiries from elderly and disabled people.' The shock-absorbing cushions protecting the outside of the vehicle are made of sponge, covered with tent fabric. Every side of the car, except the roof and underbody, is fitted with the impact-absorbing pillows, particularly at the front and rear. Ultra safe: The iSAVE YOU is so well-cushioned it can even pin pedestrians against the wall without doing them any harm. Its makers say they have had a lot of enquiries from elderly and disabled people about the vehicle . Infographic: For Japanese speakers, this image offers information about the iSAVE YOU vehicle . While the cars cushioning is intended to absorb the energy in the event of an impact, it's not clear how much this will contribute to passenger safety in a high speed crash. But since the vehicle only has a top speed of about 30mph, it's unlikely to be too much of an issue. The video below even shows how it can be driven into bystanders causing minimal harm. A single charge will run the iSAVE YOU for 18 miles and it can be recharged from any regular household plug. Apart from the vital safety aspect, the Humanix website claims that the biggest advantage of their vehicle is the ease with which it can be registered. Because of its light structure, the iSAVE YOU can be registered in Japan as a trike and it only needs a single inspection by authorities.","iSAVE YOU electric car turns received wisdom about airbags on its head .

Campaign groups have hit out at alcohol sold 'for pocket money' as one of the UK’s largest off licence chains sell bottles of booze for just 39p. As debate rages over the Government’s plan to introduce a minimum price on an alcohol unit, top chain Rhythm and Booze is selling Turbo, a heady four per cent mix of lager and lemonade, for the tiny sum.With a Crunchie costing 69p and a packet of Munchies 82p, drinkers are able to pick up a 275 ml bottle of the alcoholic beverage for a fraction of the price. Alcohol campaign groups have blasted cheap booze and claim youngsters are particularly vulnerable to alcohol sold at low prices. The Rhythm and Booze off licence chain have had the promotion on show in their store in Farsley, West Yorkshire, pictured . The outlet in Farsley, West Yorkshire, . had the bargain deal on display in the shop and confirmed a case of 24 . could be sold to a buyer - which would cost under a tenner. Emily Robinson, Director of Campaigns at Alcohol Concern, said: 'We’re calling on the Government to implement a minimum price per unit for alcohol precisely because cheap alcohol sold at pocket money can be very damaging.

Turbo, pictured, a heady four per cent mix of lager and lemonade is being sold for just 39p a bottle by off licence chain Rhythm and Booze . This week the Government announced controversial plans to tackle binge-drinking by introducing a higher-than-expected minimum price of 45p a unit for the sale of alcohol in England and Wales. Conservative Councillor Rod Wood, who represents the Calverley and Farsley, said: 'A four percent bottle of Turbo being sold at 39 pence is certainly very cheap and that is stronger than most beers.” But he added: 'I don’t think that the Government’s proposed changes to the price of alcohol will necessarily change the amount people drink. Our local licensees will, of course, conform to any changes in law, but I don’t believe this will reduce the level of alcohol consumed.' A manager at the store, who refused to be named, said: 'It is a turbo shandy and personally I don't think that there is anything wrong with it. 'To be honest, I haven't really sold any of it. I don't think it appeals to the younger market and I certainly don't think the price has made younger people want to buy it.' It is also considering banning multi-buy promotions, such as two-for-the-price-of-one.

Joanna Coles is perched on an arm of a purple velour sofa in her glass-walled Manhattan office, and talking, without a blush, about sex. ‘I’ve never met anyone who will tell you, “I’m having too much sex”,’ she says. ‘I think we’ve forgotten about the power of sex. That if you have a healthy sex life, you’re likely to live longer, you’re going to be happier, your skin will be better, your hair will be better. ‘Most people would like to have more sex but we’re all working really long hours and everybody is connected to work and social media so there is this tremendous pressure to stay engaged all the time.’ Coles, born and brought up in West Yorkshire in a village outside Leeds, is the newly-appointed editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan, the world’s largest women’s magazine and it is one of the most talked-about magazine appointments in America for years. Does Angelina, pictured with Joanna, really need sex advice? She and ex Billy-Bob Thornton were said to have had a sex dungeon . Joanna's pal Lindsay Lohan is already pretty racy. She has a habit of smashing up cars. Likes lots of lovers, not a steady guy . The magazine is read by millions in the US and Britain and is published in 64 countries around the world.What it says about sex is hugely influential in shaping the attitudes of a whole generation of young women. Cosmo . is already a title infamously, almost comically, associated with sex . yet Coles has a mission and it is this: To help women not only have . healthier and happier, but also more active, sex lives as well. Coles . continues: ‘I don’t think sex needs to be fancy, where you have orgasms . that are a symphony of glory and musicians appear at the end of the bed . playing Beethoven’s Fifth, or where you have to be tied up and wearing . the latest Agent Provocateur. I think it’s fine to have 20 or 30 minutes . of kissing and hugging and plain, old sex. Sex is this fantastic . connector and it’s free. It’s a great way to improve communication. The . other thing I’ve realised is that you don’t have to be rich to have . great sex, and that’s a good thing in this economy.’ There’s . already an App which she looks up on her iPhone. It’s called . Cosmopolitan Sex Position Of The Day. ‘I’m already in shock about the . 365 positions. Obviously I’ve got a lot of learning to do,’ she says . with a poker face. She peers at the diagram on her screen illustrating . what appears to be a particularly gymnastic approach to the act of love . and starts to laugh. ‘Today, it’s Chairway to Heaven,’ she announces. In her US size 6 Victoria Beckham . dress (a British size 10) and peep-toed Givenchy shoes, Coles at 50, . has, as they say, arrived. With sooty eyelashes, polished complexion and . a crop of expensive blonde hair, she exudes pared-down chic.

There . is a shelf crammed with photographs of Coles with America’s great and . good including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Angelina Jolie. ‘That’s . my ego wall,’ she laughs. ‘God, it’s going to sound dreadful in Britain . but over here everyone has one. People think it’s strange if you don’t . have one.’ Hob-nobbing . with presidents and movie stars, Coles, a mother of two and assiduous . networker, has come a long way from her Yorkshire upbringing. Her father . was a teacher and her mother a medical social worker – who both . encouraged her to believe she could do whatever she wanted. At . the age of ten, she had her first piece published in the children’s . section of her local newspaper, the Yorkshire Post, for a fee of £2. Coles . went on to graduate from the University of East Anglia with a degree in . English and American literature. Since then she has made a determined . push for the top. From The Spectator she went to the Daily Telegraph and . The Guardian. Four years after arriving in . Manhattan in 1997 as The Guardian’s New York correspondent, she had the . chance to return to London as a parliamentary sketchwriter for another . newspaper. She turned it down. Looking out of her window last week, she . surmises that if she had taken the job she would be, ‘living in Chiswick . right now, still working as a sketchwriter and having a really great . life. But what’s fun about New York is that it’s so much bigger’. Last year, after improving both . circulation and advertising as editor of Marie Claire, she shrewdly let . it be known she was thinking about her next move. When Kate White, . editor of Cosmo for 14 years, announced that she was stepping down, . Coles was in pole position to replace her. She now plans to update the fashion coverage and add a campaigning aspect to the magazine.‘I . want Cosmo to be right in the middle of the fight that’s going on in . America about abortion, birth control and women’s health issues. We’re . living in the dark ages in America in terms of women’s access to . contraception,’ she says.

Designer Donna Karan, another of Joanna's connections, must have a steamy sub-conscious. She created a perfume bottle that looks like a sex toy . Career . support is important to young women entering the workplace and Cosmo . has always encouraged women to be ambitious, she adds. ‘I had a great . time in my 20s,’ she remembers. ‘I had a few boyfriends but mainly, like . all my female friends, I was focused on getting my career in the right . place so I wasn’t in any hurry to settle down. ‘We . really did live our version of Sex And The City, only in Notting Hill. It was brunches and trips and shopping and panicking about whether our . bosses thought we were doing a good enough job. I knew I would . eventually have children, I just wanted to feel financially secure . before I did.’ She says she wishes she had not been so sensible and had . taken more risks. She met her husband Peter Godwin, a writer and human rights activist, when she was 28 and they have two sons – Thomas, 13, and Hugo, ten. The family lives on the Upper West Side of the city in a large apartment where they entertain a glossy mix of actors, media types and politicians. Martin Amis, Alan Rickman, Oliver Platt, Peter Mandelson and Sir John Sawers are all part of what Coles describes as ‘her posse’. Coles tweets and has taken part in reality TV shows such as Project Runway and Running In Heels. She is also making a film with Wendy Finerman, who produced The Devil Wears Prada. ‘It’s based on an article that appeared in Marie Claire about a man who asked his wife if he could have a threesome for his 40th birthday. She reluctantly agreed as long as she could choose the woman. I think every studio in Hollywood wanted to buy the story.’ Does all this activity leave much time for family? ‘I don’t feel guilty about working full-time or suffer maternal guilt. I’m there when my kids wake up in the mornings – unless I’m in Paris or Milan,’ she says. ‘I’m not a helicopter parent by nature and managing family and work is easier when you’re the boss because you control your own schedule.’ She is still getting to know her editorial team but has already scolded them for not going out to enough parties. ‘I want us to fan out like a Cosmo army of sexily clad young women every single evening and bring back intelligence from the social frontlines of Manhattan,’ she says. Coles adds that she used to have ‘a truly dreadful fashion sense’ but has learned over the years how to make the best of herself. ‘Buy everything a size bigger and get it tailored,’ she says. ‘That’s  the best dressing tip I can give  anyone.’ Her wider family still lives in Yorkshire and Coles has a sort of Brit grittiness that keeps her grounded. ‘One of the first people I heard from when I got the job was Barbara Taylor Bradford,’ she says. ‘She’s in her 80s and sent me the nicest letter saying we should have lunch and do some Yorkshire bonding. I was like – fantastic – break out the Hovis and the Yorkshire teabags!’ Coles may be in charge of the world’s biggest women’s magazine but she still baulks at having her own photograph taken. ‘I like control, I love retouching,’ she says. Yet she looks directly into the camera. ‘Make me look younger, thinner, richer, blonder!’ she tells the photographer as Manhattan glimmers behind her.",Yorkshire-born Joanna Coles is the new editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan - the world's largest women's magazine .
"By . Sam Greenhill . PUBLISHED: . 11:20 EST, 28 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:01 EST, 29 November 2012 . Paula Hamilton was detained by a tracker dog . The brakes went on Paula Hamilton’s high-flying career years ago. But the downfall of the former model – who found fame starring in an iconic car TV commercial – appeared complete yesterday as she was banned from driving after drunkenly crashing into a neighbour’s conservatory. In an illustration of just how bizarre her life has become, the 51-year-old seemed more concerned about how she was addressed in court than the offence itself. She took particular exception to presiding magistrate Philip Dobson calling her ‘Mrs’ rather than Miss Hamilton. Speaking from the dock at Aylesbury Magistrates’ Court in Buckinghamshire, she said: ‘Sorry, I must correct you, it’s Miss Hamilton. I have not been married sadly.’ The comment is a little puzzling. She is on record as having wed cameraman Danny Mindel in 1987 in a union that lasted two-and-a-half years. Miss Hamilton was the glamorous face of Volkswagen cars in the Eighties. She is most famous for a 1987 advert in which she was seen leaving a house, ripping off her pearls, fur coat and her wedding ring, but keeping the keys to a VW Golf. ‘If only everything in life was as reliable as a Volkswagen,’ ran the tagline. Sadly, her own life has been lacking in such reliability. After failed relationships, cocaine and drink addictions, and years of therapy, she reached a new low in the late-night car crash on September 4 this year in which she  lost her front teeth. The court heard the crash happened at 4am  when her green-coloured Hyundai car veered off the road just 200 yards from her home in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire. Scroll down for video . Former supermodel Paula Hamilton (left after the crash this year, right in 1991 when she was discovered by David Bailey) claimed in court she was 'mauled' by a police dog when it found her after the crash in September . She demolished a garden fence and smashed into the newly-built £20,000 conservatory of her 68-year-old neighbour. Peter Bird, prosecuting, said paramedics could not find the driver with the wreckage of the car, and alerted police. A police dog discovered Hamilton . collapsed in an alleyway nearby, said Mr Bird. She later claimed the . animal had ‘mauled’ her. The court heard the dog inflicted some ‘some . bruising’. A sample of Hamilton’s blood showed that she had 106mg of alcohol – the legal limit is 80mg – per 100ml of her blood. The extensive damage caused to the conservatory by former supermodel Paula Hamilton who does not remember getting behind the wheel . The crash happened at 4am on September 4, when the supermodel's green Hyundai smashed into the property . Troubled life: Miss Hamilton's life began to unravel as she fought battles against alcohol and cocaine (pictured left in 1991 and right in 1994) Tragedy has dogged Paula Hamilton from birth. The product of an affair her mother had with a family friend, John Johnson – who was battered to death in a drunken brawl in 1976 – she had four younger half-siblings. She never settled in at school and left at 16, but not before losing her virginity to Simon Cowell. They were childhood sweethearts while growing up in Hertfordshire in the 1970s, and she said that, in contrast to his ‘Mr Nasty’ image on TV, he was ‘very, very protective’. She is most famous for her iconic VW ad in 1987, when she was 27, in which she was made up to look like Princess Diana. But she was also the main model of the Queen’s couturier Sir Hardy Amies and a muse of royal photographer Lord Lichfield. Her life began to unravel as she fought battles against alcohol and cocaine, and she emigrated to New Zealand in 2000 after racking up a series of convictions for drink-driving. After moving back to Britain in 2006, she became a judge on reality TV series Britain’s Next Top Model. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in that year, but in 2007 it was revealed she was in fact suffering from dyspraxia, a condition that affects coordination. Two weeks later, Miss Hamilton . claimed in a press interview that she had swerved to avoid hitting deer . in the road. She was quoted as saying: ‘I’ve lost my front teeth and . I’m in huge amounts of pain, but it was worth it to save that mother . deer and her baby.’ Miss Hamilton, who is having dental . work costing £15,000, explained driving at 4am by saying she had been . heading to a spot near her home in search of nettles, which she blends . into smoothies or makes into soup. ‘I often go nettle hunting and I keep irregular hours, so if the urge takes me I just go,’ she said. Later, in a police interview, she . answered mainly no comment despite admitting to officers she had told . the press she was involved in the accident. But in court yesterday, Miss Hamilton . claimed she could not remember getting into the car at all, nor leaving . it after the crash. David Hicks, defending, explained . that his client had been in a pub before the crash, suggesting she had . gone there to help with her conditions such as dyslexia. He said she had . been diagnosed with dyslexia, dyspraxia and Asperger’s syndrome – a . form of autism – at the age of 47, and as a result was ‘encouraged to . seek social occasions’. ‘On this occasion she attended a public house,’ said Mr Hicks. He added: ‘She has no recollection of . getting back into the car after walking home from the public house, and . does not recall leaving the vehicle before the police arrived.’ He said Hamilton wanted to put ‘the mistake behind her’ and ‘realises that she made an error of judgment’. At times, dark-haired Hamilton, . wearing a smart navy coat and brown scarf, appeared to struggle to hear . what was being said as she sat in the dock. Magistrate Mr Dobson . disqualified her from driving for 14 months. He also ordered her to pay a . £160 fine, a £15 ‘victim surcharge’ and court costs of £85. The former model, seen here in a Volkswagen car advert, wants to put the mistake 'behind her' She was told her driving ban could be reduced by three months if she took part in a drink-driver rehabilitation course. Discovered by photographer David Bailey, Hamilton was one of the modelling stars of the 1980s. At the height of her success, she had . an affair with the billionaire former Conservative party vice-chairman . Lord  Ashcroft, and in the 1990s  was engaged to film-maker Henry Cole. She also had flings with former . England cricketer Ed Giddins and a former Life Guards Captain called . Sebastian Rhodes-Stampa, who proposed but then left her two days later. Miss Hamilton, seen arriving at court, realised that 'she made an error of judgement,' the defence lawyer said .","Former model had her two front teeth knocked out in crash, and does not remember getting into the car or leaving the scene .

A lorry driver who killed a policeman who had stopped to help a woman on a motorway with a flat tyre has been jailed. PC Mark Goodlad, 41, was helping a female motorist with a flat tyre when Andrew Abernethy’s truck smashed into his marked BMW X5 police car on the southbound carriageway of the M1 near Wakefield in West Yorkshire. Abernethy, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, admitted dangerous driving and was found to be travelling at around 56mph when the accident occurred in October last year. Motorway collision: PC Mark Goodlad (left) was killed when Andrew Abernethy (right) drove his lorry at 'full speed' into Mr Goodlad's stationary police car, pinning him between two cars . The 45-year-old claimed he had something irritating his left eye as his lorry, carrying a 17,000lbs load of bedding, drifted from the lane onto the hard shoulder, partly mounting the grass verge. He then smashed into Mr Goodlad’s car, pinning him between his vehicle and Sharon Burgess’ Suzuki Swift as he helped her. Father-of-one Mr Goodlad, who had remarried just months earlier, was getting the spare tyre out of Mrs Burgess’ car at the time. He was freed by firemen but died soon afterwards from multiple injuries. Mrs Burgess was slightly injured and has suffered psychological trauma since the accident, Leeds Crown Court heard. In sentencing Abernethy to two years and . nine months jail, Judge Scott Wolstenholme said: ‘You were not paying . attention to the road for a considerable time and all along trundling . along in that enormous truck at fifty miles an hour.’ After the case, Mr Goodlad's widow Helen said: ‘The past thirteen months have been agonising. Mounted the verge: Abernethy admitted to dangerous driving after claiming he had something irritating his left eye when his lorry drifted off the road and hit Mr Goodlad's police car (pictured) ‘We all know that Mr Abernethy did . not set out that day with the intention of taking a life but it is . without doubt that he is solely responsible for the death of my husband . Mark.’ Abernethy had started driving that . day just one hour earlier, travelling from his depot in  Middleton, . Manchester, and was on his way to Chesterfield when the collision . happened, the court heard. Jailed: Abernethy arrives at Leeds Crown Court where he was jailed for two years, nine months for the accident . Andrew Dallas, prosecuting, said that there was no suggestion that Abernethy, a father of a teenage daughter, had fallen asleep at the wheel before the late afternoon crash. The driver claimed he had suddenly got a pain in his left eye and had taken his spectacles off to ‘remove a foreign object’. Abernethy said he had woken up that morning feeling a pain in his left eye and a hospital examination did discover an abrasion on the cornea. He failed to notice that his lorry was drifting onto the hard shoulder and said he did not see the police vehicle, which had its flashing warning lights on, until the last second. Other drivers said they saw the lorry slowly drift from motorway onto the hard shoulder and one claimed it then hit the police car ‘at full speed’. Experts said that the lorry could have . travelled for up to 10 seconds for 820ft along the hard shoulder, . drifting partly onto the grass verge. Judge Wolstenholme said he was satisfied . that Abernethy had a problem with his eye but said he had failed to pay . attention to the road ahead. Abernethy will serve half his jail sentence and was banned from driving for three years. Mrs . Goodlad said her husband was her ‘life,’ adding: ‘There are no words to . describe how much I love and miss him.

Although neither Wang nor Balenciaga would confirm the appointment, WWD say that market sources have revealed that the appointment is a done deal. Scottish designer Christopher Kane had been tipped for the role by many in the fashion industry but Wang's simple, structured design ethic has helped him to triumph in the race to replace Nicolas Ghesquière, who leaves the fashion house this week after 15 years at the helm. Balenciaga bound: 28-year-old fashion designer, Alexander Wang is set to take the reins at Balenciaga . Missed out: Christopher Kane (pictured left with stylist Caroline Sieber) lost out to Alexander Wang in the fight to replace Nicolas Ghesquière (pictured right with actress Jennifer Connolly) at Balenciaga . Balenciaga is one of the biggest and oldest fashion houses on the . planet, with offerings that range from ready-to-wear to fragrance. The label came into existence in 1918, when Spanish designer, Cristóbal Balenciaga, opened his first shop in San Sebastián in Spain. After the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his shop, Balenciaga decamped to Paris, where he quickly became one of the French capital's top design talents, with Christian Dior describing him as 'the master of us all.' Following Balenciaga's death in 1972, the house lay dormant until 1986 when it was taken over by the Gucci Group and handed over to designer Michel Goma who reigned for five years before passing on the mantle to Josephus Thimister . Included in his team was Nicolas Ghesquière who presided over the fashion house for 15 years and was responsible for a period that saw sales soar and legions of celebrity fans come on board.

Today, the brand is best known for its motorcycle inspired handbags, including the 2000 smash hit 'Lariat' bag, while Twilight actress Kirsten Stewart is the face of Balenciaga's current fragrance, Flora Botanica. Despite Ghesquière's trademark avant-garde aesthetic, the brand regularly dresses the A-list for red carpet events, with fans including actresses Nicole Kidman and Sienna Miller, as well as fashion industry titans such as French Vogue's Emmanuelle Alt and American Vogue supremo, Anna Wintour. Alexander Wang graduated from New York's Parsons School of Design in 2005 and interned at Teen Vogue before launching his eponymous label. Beginning with a capsule collection of cashmere knitwear, plaudits followed thick and fast, and Wang launched his first full ready-to-wear collection in 2007.  Not far behind was his diffusion line, T by Alexander Wang, which launched in 2009 - the same year that he won the Vogue/CFDA Fashion Fund Award. The 28-year-old opened his debut flagship store in Manhattan in 2011 and remains hugely popular thanks to his chic, pared down designs.","Alexander Wang has become a cult fashion industry figure since launching his eponymous line in 2007 .

Oxfam is calling for an increase in the minimum wage to protect low-income workers from a 'perfect storm' of benefit cuts, rising living standards and a lack of jobs. The charity called for the rise as part of a package of measures ahead of today's publication of official figures which they predicted would show an increase in the number of working people in poverty. Already six in every 10 of the 7.9 million working-age adults in poverty are not from jobless households, it said, because austerity measures are 'disproportionately impacting' the low-paid. Pay rise: Oxfam is calling for an increase in the minimum wage to protect low-income workers . Thousands more than last year are turning to food banks and other charity facilities as average earnings have shrunk 4.4 per cent, the report noted, while pay of FTSE 100 company directors rose 49 per cent. Improving that rate requires actions such as reversing cuts to working tax credits and reducing the amount of the new Universal Credit people lose when starting a job, from 65 per cent to 55 per cent. Oxfam's director of UK poverty Chris . Johnes said: 'Despite the Government's rhetoric about making work pay, . having a job is no longer necessarily enough to lift someone out of . poverty.

'If we carry on down this path, the UK will return to levels of inequality not seen since Victorian times.' A DWP spokesman said: 'Over the last decade vast sums of money have been poured into the benefits system in an attempt to address poverty - £150 billion was spent on tax credits alone between 2004 and 2010. 'This approach has failed, with the UK likely to miss its own 2010 child poverty targets. 'We need to address the root causes of poverty including worklessness. 'The universal credit will replace a complex mess of benefits and tax credits and make work pay.

The John Terry racism trial will follow his accuser Anton Ferdinand ‘for the rest of his career’, a court heard yesterday. Duncan Penny, prosecuting, said it had taken courage to make a criminal allegation against a fellow footballer. He said Terry must be judged guilty if the court was satisfied he said ‘f***ing black c***’ as an insult, regardless of his motivation. Scroll down for video . In court: John Terry, pictured today,  is accused of calling Anton Ferdinand a 'f****** black c*** during a Premier League game but he denies a racially aggravated public order offence claiming he was repeating a slur . Denial: Terry denies a racially aggravated public . order offence, and claims that he was sarcastically repeating the slur . that Ferdinand mistakenly thought he had used. A verdict is expected tomorrow . The Chelsea defender, and former . England captain, is accused of lashing out verbally in a Premier League . match after being goaded about an extra-marital affair with a . team-mate’s girlfriend. Terry, 31, admits using the offending . words, but claims he was simply repeating back the slur he thought . Ferdinand had directed at him, and denies a racially aggravated public . order offence. Making his closing speech at . Westminster magistrates’ court, Mr Penny said Ferdinand, who plays for . QPR, did not have the ‘motivation or frankly the sophistication’ to make . up the allegation. He said the brother of Manchester . United star Rio did not even believe he had been abused until he saw . footage of October’s incident on YouTube. ‘This case will follow him for the rest of his career. He made it clear he did not wish to be here,’ added Mr Penny. George Carter-Stephenson, QC, defending, said there was an abundance of evidence to prove ‘this is not a case about racism’. He said Ferdinand’s evidence was . inconsistent and unreliable and argued that Terry may have misheard the . word ‘black’ or been confused by a shout from the crowd. Support: Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho denied Terry was a racist in a statement read at court. Yesterday, team mate Ashley Cole, right, said Terry should not have been brought to court over the claims . Mr Carter-Stephenson rejected claims . that Terry lost his temper to goading about the alleged affair, taunts . which he had faced 'hundreds of times before'. The barrister asked: 'Can it really . be right that Mr Terry totally loses his cool, as suggested by the . prosecution, in relation to a further taunt by Mr Ferdinand about . s******* his team mate's missus? 'The defence suggests that there is an inherent implausibility in that, given the evidence before this court. 'Mr Terry has 600 games behind him by . way of professional top-level football experience, spanning 14 years. He . has been sent off on four occasions, never in relation to his language. 'It is inconceivable to suggest that . the taunt from Anton Ferdinand, that Mr Terry has heard hundreds of . times before, and you may think he's heard far worse in relation to his . mother, made him snap in the way suggested.' After hearing the speeches, magistrates adjourned the hearing until tomorrow afternoon when they will deliver a verdict. The court heard yesterday that some fans have chanted sexual insults about Terry's mother. Expert lip-readers were called in by both the prosecution and defence as part of the trial. However Mr Carter-Stephenson said lip-reading even in controlled conditions only has an accuracy of 60 to 80 per cent. Key moment: Terry and QPR's Anton Ferdinand clash during the Barclays Premier League match at Loftus Road . Terry, 31, is accused of using the racial slur on the pitch during a game on October 23 last year. He denies a racially aggravated . public order offence, and claims that he was sarcastically repeating the . slur that Ferdinand mistakenly thought he had used. Earlier, England and Chelsea team mate Ashley Cole said Terry should not have been brought to court over the claims. Cole, also 31, told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'I think we shouldn't be sitting here.' He said while racism should never be tolerated, repeating what you thought someone said was 'completely different'. Cole said: 'If I repeated something that I thought you said, that's totally different than if someone just says something.' The court was read a statement from former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who denied Terry was racist. Mourinho, . who manages Spanish champions Real Madrid, said Terry had an excellent . relationship with all the players regardless of ethnicity when he was . Chelsea boss between June 2004 and September 2009. Terry also championed . the FA's anti-racism campaigns. Mourinho said: 'I never once . witnessed any demonstration of racism or racial abuse or behaviour. I am . certain that John Terry is not a racist.' Several . players - including Frank Lampard, Fernando Torres and Petr Cech - had . signed copies of a prepared statement that said: 'I have never heard . John Terry use any form of racist language and have never heard any . suggestion that he may have done so.' Earlier, Cole told the court that on the day of the match at Loftus Road, he saw Ferdinand make a fist gesture to imply sex and could see him saying something. He said: 'I can't make out - him either saying Bridgey (Cole made the fist gesture) or black.' This has been taken as a taunt about Terry's alleged affair with Wayne Bridges' ex-girlfriend. Cole did not hear Terry say anything in reply to the goading, he said. After the match, Cole was present when Terry asked Ferdinand what had happened. 'I think John said, ""did you think I called you a black c***, did you think I was being racist?'"".Then I said, ""did you think John was being racist?"". Anton said, ""no, no"".' The two players then shook hands and went their separate ways. It is expected that prosecution and defence counsel will give their closing speeches today, and Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle will give his verdict tomorrow afternoon. A verdict is expected today.

An extremely rare set of 400-year-old playing cards made of silver and gold that were owned by a princess have been discovered. The extraordinary deck of ‘silver cards’ gilded with gold were first sold at auction at Christie’s auction house for £2,421,123 in 2010. Recently a historian described them as one of only five known decks of silver cards and the only complete set. Gilded with gold: The set of 'silver cards' is one of only five known decks and the only complete set and was created around 1616 . Legend has it that the cards were owned by Portuguese princess Infanta Carlota Joaquina, who married a prince in Portugal before fleeing to Brazil when Napoleon’s armies marched into Iberia in 1807. Stories say she took the set with her. Timothy Schroder, a historian specialising in gold and silver decorative arts, recently wrote in his book: ‘Only five sets of silver cards are known today and of these only one — the Zilkha set (referring to the current owner) — is complete. ‘They were not made for playing with but as works of art for the collector's cabinet, or Kunstkammer.’ Creating the silver cards was a hazardous job as each of the 52 cards was gilded using mercury, a deadly chemical, a process which is illegal today. Even in Renaissance times, people knew the process was dangerous. Risky process: Mercury was used to gild the gold to the silver - a process which is illegal today and even in Renaissance times, people knew the process was dangerous . Mr Schroder was quoted in Live Science saying: ‘I don't think they quite understood why it was dangerous, but they did appreciate the dangers of it. ‘You ground up gold into kind of a dust, and you mix it with mercury, and you painted that onto the surface where you wished the gilding to appear.’ He explained that the mercury disperses in the kiln in a process ‘that would leave the gold chemically bonded to the silver’. In her hands: Legend has it that Portuguese princess Infanta Carlota Joaquina took the set of silver cards with her when she fled to Brazil as Napoleon's armies marched into Iberia in 1807 . Prince Carlota is thought to have given the silver cards to the wife of Felipe Contucci, a man who helped her try to take the Spanish crown after Napoleon forced her brother, Ferdinand VII, to abdicate. The cards were created in Germany around 1616 and engraved by Michael Frömmer at a time when no standardised style of cards existed. At the time, different parts of Europe had their own styles of cards. This set uses a suit that has been seen in Italy with coins, swords, cups and batons each suit with a king, a knight, a knave, and pip cards ace through ten. Each card is about 3.4 x 2 inches and blank on the back.","They are one of just five known sets and the only complete set .

'Stop, please, try to be nice,' Hope has asked them, weeping. They claim that their actions were motivated by a long-standing feud between their family and Holly's family, the Knights. 'It started last year we had trouble on the bus, she was miserable she didn’t want to ride the bus, cried every morning,' said Tricia Knight, Hope’s mother, to Fox. 'He treats her like crap, and most recently the dad got involved.' The Baileys, who have five children, live next door to the Knights. Maryann Abel, the assistant court . administrator for Stark County Family Court, told MailOnline that the . Joseph will not face any charges because of his young age. '(Prosecutors) thought he was acting under the influence of his father,' she said. They say the bullying has grown more intense and hurtful in the past few months and they had to raise the alarm.

'They . were down at the bus stop yelling ""retard"" and I told my son, ""If they . want to call us 'retard,' we’ll show them a 'retard.'"" And we walked to . the car from the bus like that. I did that with my son,' he said. Retaliation: Mr Bailey said that the Knights have repeatedly mocked his son, who suffers from seizures and ADHD . Plea: 'Stop, please, try to be nice,' Hope has asked them, weeping . His wife Vickie Bailey defended his actions. 'He . did get out of the car, you’ve seen the video I am sure, my kid was . walking like, but no offense to Hope so why they are taking it that way, . I have no idea,' Mrs Bailey said. Solidarity: The family has created t-shirts that read 'STOP the bullying' to band together . She insisted this was not a case of a grown man bullying a defenseless girl, claiming instead that the two families have a long standing rivalry. Both families have filed complaints with the prosecutors office, Fox reports, but no charges have been filed. 'We are aware that there are neighbor problems between the families ... name-calling, loud music and other violations,' said Sgt. Terry Curry. 'We will address any violation of the Ohio law, any incident that may occur.' Neighbors say they are fed up with the feud between the two clans. 'Their daughters play together and ride bikes together, their sons ride bikes together, the (Knight) kids swim in the (Bailey) kids’ pool with them,' Ray Burdette, who lives about 500 feet away, told the Canton Rep. 'Two weeks ago, they were down playing basketball and riding bikes together and now this.' Mrs Knight and Mrs Baily agreed that the families have been close, perhaps too close for comfort, since the Knights moved in two years ago. 'Kids don’t always get along. I would be a liar if I told you my kids weren’t brats, too,' Mrs Knight told the newspaper. Mrs Bailey claims she was heart-broken over the fighting. 'I love those guys. I still do,' she said. 'But this needs to stop.'","Parents Mike and Tricia Knight say Hope Holcomb,10, is humiliated .

Property ladder: Young people are having to wait longer to buy their first property - with two-thirds relying on help from their parents . Two-thirds  of first-time buyers are relying on the ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’ to get on the property ladder. Figures released yesterday by the Council of Mortgage Lenders highlight the crippling impact of high house prices on a generation of young people, who are forced into renting or living with parents or friends. The CML said 66 per cent of first-time buyers in recent years have had parental assistance courtesy of what has become known as the ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’. This rises to 72 per cent in London because house prices are so much higher in the capital – £364,000 on average, compared with £163,000 nationally. Overall, the CML said a typical . first-time buyer is 29, puts down a 20 per cent deposit – with parental . help – and has a total household income of £34,000. In London, they are typically 31, put . down a 25 per cent deposit – also with help from their parents – and . have a total household income of £50,000. By comparison, retired homeowners . over the age of 65 have more than £750billion of ‘property wealth’ tied . up in the value of their homes, the equity release firm Key Retirement . Solutions said yesterday. Housing minister Mark Prisk has said it ‘cannot be right’ that so many young people are unable to fulfil their dream of buying their own home. Speaking at a CML conference earlier this month, the Tory MP, a former chartered surveyor, said the Coalition had inherited ‘a dysfunctional housing market whether it is freehold or leasehold’. He added: ‘We see 1.6million young people – people in their 20s and 30s – still living with mum and dad because they can’t afford their own place. That cannot be right.’ At the same conference, Martijn van der Heijden, chairman of the CML, said owning a home was still hugely important to millions. He said: ‘We know – pretty much – that the UK housing psyche, while a bit bruised, still holds homeownership extremely dear.’ But he added that it is ‘more difficult to achieve than it used to be’, and would-be owners need to accept renting ‘is likely to be a tenure in which most new households will spend at least some time.’ Around 17million people in Britain own their own home, around nine million have a mortgage and around eight million have no loan and own their property outright. But the number of first-time buyers getting a loan has collapsed since the credit crunch. There were around 570,000 in 2001, but only 193,000 last year. Jamie Askew, 26, and his girlfriend Catherine Davies, 25, managed to get on the property ladder last year, thanks to Miss Davies’s father. The couple, who were childhood sweethearts, had saved a deposit of £7,000. But they were only able to afford their three-bedroom home in Prenton, the Wirral, because Miss Davies’s father, George, used his savings to help them under Lloyds TSB’s Lend a Hand Scheme. It meant the couple only needed to put down a 5 per cent deposit on their £148,000 home. Mr Davies put around £30,000 into a savings account at the bank, which acts as a guarantee on repayments. Mr Askew joked that without his help, ‘we wouldn’t have been able to buy for at least 25 years’. He added: ‘Catherine’s dad did everything that he could to help us to buy something that could be our home.’ Last week, a Bank of England report said that the availability of credit ‘continued to restrain first-time buyers’, and added that stamp duty thresholds may also be ‘restraining’ homeowners from trading up to a larger property. For example, the tax is charged at 3 per cent on a property of £500,000 but it jumps to 4 per cent at £500,001. Duncan Stott, of Priced Out, a first-time buyer campaign group, said: ‘Sky-high house prices are destroying the aspirations of a whole generation of would-be first time buyers. Britain simply can’t call itself a property-owning democracy if homeownership is only open to those from the wealthiest backgrounds.’ Concern: Housing minister Mark Prisk said the coalition had inherited a 'dysfunctional housing market'","Figure highlight generation forced to rent or live with parents or friends .

Gary and Sandra Coyne both had good jobs, a house in a desirable area and a comfortable lifestyle. So what made them exchange all that for the chaos that comes with renovating an old property – and sharing it with live-in builders? The answer is a derelict windmill in Stoke Ferry near King’s Lynn, Norfolk, which Gary spotted while browsing the internet. At the time the Coynes had not even decided to move from their home in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, let alone relocate to Norfolk. But Gary, who had been working as a restaurant manager in London, fancied a change of pace and the couple could see the benefits of having more space for their five-year-old twins Louis and Rory. Change of pace: Sandra and Gary Coyne fell in love with The Old Mill in Stoke Ferry and decided to do it up to live a rural life . For Sandra, 44, an air hostess based at  Heathrow, moving to Norfolk presented the prospect of a very long commute. However, after visiting the property just once, the  couple fell in love with it, and in 2005 they bought The Old Mill, complete with two-and-half acres of land, for £315,000. The property comprises a mill house and an adjoining Grade II listed tower. Both needed a lot of updating – especially the tower, which hadn’t been used for nearly 100 years except by nesting birds. To complicate matters further, the Coynes’ house in Gerrards Cross took a long time to sell, which meant the couple had to borrow the deposit for the mill and rent their old home until they found a buyer. During one stage of the building work at their new property, the Coynes found themselves living in the four-bedroom mill house with their builders. The team knocked out walls to transform four small rooms into a large open-plan kitchen and living space. New bathrooms were also added. The Coynes did not have a kitchen for three months, so meals were cooked on a camping stove, and the dishes were rinsed in the shower. As a tidy person, Sandra hated the chaos of living with builders, and confesses she was unprepared for all the upheaval. Renovated: The Coynes in their living room, complete with the old millstone . Gary, 47, who gave up his restaurant job, did as much of the work as he could himself, including removing all the windows to repair broken panes before refitting them. But when a firm came to sandblast the interior walls to take them back to the original Victorian red brick, they failed to cover the windows, destroying all Gary’s hard work. The tower’s ground floor has now been turned into a formal dining room with a circular table. The floor above is a games room and there are bedrooms on the next three floors. The final two floors have been transformed into a gallery with views over the surrounding countryside. The ground-floor dining room has underfloor heating, but the tower’s listed status meant it was not possible to plumb in bathrooms. Instead, a glass walkway from the first floor of the tower links it to the house and its three bathrooms. In the winter, the upper floors of the tower are heated with plug-in oil radiators. It took nearly two years, but the work was finished in time for Sandra’s 40th birthday party at the end of 2007. The improvements cost the Coynes about £150,000. They are delighted with what they’ve achieved, although Sandra admits there were times when she would have gladly scrapped the entire project. ‘I would remember back to when we lived in Gerrards Cross and had two good salaries, a comfortable house and a settled life, and wondered what on earth we were doing,’ she says. The Coynes soon realised they had the ideal property to rent out and began letting  The Old Mill as a holiday home in 2008 when they were away. Then, in July 2008, Sandra spotted a farmhouse in nearby Boughton. The Coynes raised the money to buy it and moved out of The Old Mill, enabling them to rent it all year round. The Old Mill, which now has seven bedrooms and three bathrooms and sleeps 15, has proved a big hit as a holiday let. And with Gary’s new private chef service offering holidaymakers gourmet meals, the property earns the couple £100,000 a year. ‘We do everything ourselves – we want everything to be perfect,’ says Sandra. The Old Mill costs from £2,500 a week through holidaylettings.co.uk .","Gary and Sandra Coyne upped sticks and moved into a derelict windmill .

It's a time of year that sees millions of families get together to celebrate and exchange gifts - but relatives of Armed Forces personnel serving their country abroad will not get to pass on those presents in person. Those families can still let their brother, sister, son or daughter know that they are thinking about them by sending a Christmas parcel to the front line. And for personnel at the Army's transport hub at RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, the hard work of playing Santa and making sure tonnes of festive treats reach Afghanistan in time has already begun. Inundated: Troops at Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, unload bags of Christmas mail from the UK . Festive: A transport hub at RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, has already dispatched 10,500 sacks of Christmas mail to Afghanistan this week . This week more than 10,500 bags of mail and gifts were dispatched and will arrive with serving soldiers before Christmas Day. Lieutenant Colonel Brett Duxbury, of the British Forces Post Office (BFPO), said: 'As with every year, the Christmas post period is by far our busiest. 'Just this week we dispatched more than 10,500 bags of mail to operational theatres, which will arrive in time for Christmas Day. 'We do not underestimate the impact that mail from friends and family can have on morale and it is for that reason we make it our priority each year to ensure it arrives on time.' The military's premier transport hub at RAF Brize Norton at Carterton in Oxfordshire is gearing up for its busiest time of the year. Gifts: Christmas mail ready for delivery to Afghanistan is pile high in a hangar at RAF Brize Norton . Hundreds of service personnel are working hard to ensure that this mail is delivered alongside other vital supplies such as helicopters, armoured vehicles and life-saving equipment. Logistician Corporal Daniel Smith, of 1 Air Mobility Wing, said: 'In the last two days more than 23 tonnes of mail has arrived at Brize Norton from BFPO, which has been loaded onto aircraft and is now en route to various operational theatres including Afghanistan. 'It's a challenging but important task ensuring it is all dispatched quickly. 'Having served in Afghanistan at Christmas last year, I understand how much value our boys and girls place on receiving post from people closest to them.' This year, Army bosses have urged well-wishers . to stop sending Christmas gifts to soldiers in Afghanistan - because they . are stopping packages from military families from getting through. A torrent of gifts are sent to . soldiers serving abroad each year, and while senior Army officials say . that the gifts are greatly appreciated, they are clogging up postal . system stopping letters from soldiers' loved ones getting through. Instead, well-wishers have been asked to make a donation to a service charity this year. Not only can the gifts delay . morale-boosting parcels from loved ones, but the onward delivery of . parcels to forward operating bases requires extra re-supply flights and . convoys, which can place troops at risk from attack. Mark Francois, Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, added: 'This Government is dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of our Armed Forces, particularly those deployed on operations. Heavy work: Postal Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) for Lashkah Gar, Lance Corporal Jagprasad Jugjali, 30 from Nepal gets hands on a fresh batch of mail at Camp Bastion, Afghanistan . 'This is reflected in the Deployed Welfare Package, a key part of which is the safe and timely delivery of free personal mail from family and friends. 'In the past this mechanism has been used by the general public to show their support and resulted in huge volumes of unsolicited goodwill parcels being sent, which have overwhelmed the in-theatre postal and logistics capability. 'Whilst unsolicited mail is well-intentioned, mail sent by families and friends is the most important to be deployed personnel and is our absolute priority. 'Moreover, unsolicited mail strains the logistics supply and prevents mail from families getting through. 'For this reason the Ministry of Defence will be repeating its unsolicited mail campaign. 'Rather than sending their own letter or parcel, I would encourage people to make a donation to one of Britain's excellent service charities. 'They might also consider 'uk4u Thanks!' - a charity that provides Christmas gifts to deployed service personnel. 'Once again I would like to say thank you to the British public, on behalf of the MoD and Armed Forces, for their incredible support of our serving personnel.' uk4u Thanks! will for the ninth year deliver a Christmas box of practical gifts and treats to every soldier, sailor and airman deployed overseas - in Afghanistan and elsewhere - in time for Christmas Day. Its parcels are delivered via the supply chain, meaning there is no impact on the mail network.","More than 10,500 bags of mail and gifts have been dispatched to Afghanistan this week .

We are going to start a petition and send it to the council. I was hoping to emigrate to Gambia next year but I will never be able to sell the house. 'My son is in the building trade and he said the house has devalued by £20,000. The council needs to do something. When I moved in it was not like this. I just don’t know what to do because it’s really getting me down.' Mr Hudson has also raised concerns about the health risks posed by the rat infested tower of rubbish. He added: 'There are rats everywhere and I’ve even had to get two cats because we were getting so many of them. 'It is only a metre away from my back . yard. We have seen rats running about all over, you wouldn’t believe . the amount the cats kill. 'This is meant to be a plastic recycling centre but I don’t see much recycling going on. 'Some say its like an ocean of plastic but I would say it was worse than that - it’s like a tidal wave when you look out at it. 'Even the environmental health said that it was bad and he said that in his eyes it was illegal but they’ve said what is happening is not illegal.' Untidy: The view from Mr Hudson's back garden shows huge piles of plastic covering the V10 Polymers site . Health concerns: Mr Hudson claims the mound of plastic recycling at the plant is infested with rats and now owns two cats to help cope with the problem . Big loss: Mr Hudson claims the state of the recycling plant has devalued his property by £20,000 . Mr Hudson said the problems started when a factory was torn down on the site and replaced with the dump. He said: 'When I moved in 10 years ago it was . summer and everything was flowering and I had a reasonable view looking . out over the factory and it was fine - but not anymore. 'They found asbestos in the roof and demolished it and this started piling up. If the factory was still there it wouldn’t be like this. They wouldn’t be able to pile all this stuff up in a factory. Campaign: Mr Hudson is now asking his local council and the Environment Agency to take action against V10 Polymers . 'There was a wall behind my yard which . went straight across but they demolished that, I had to stop them . demolishing the wall in front otherwise the rubbish would have been up . to my back yard. 'I kept thinking that something would be done about it because it was getting out of hand but nothing was ever done about it. 'In winter when all the leaves have fallen and there aren’t my roses and clematis it looks really bare and all you can see is that eyesore. 'I can’t get out because no one will want to buy the house and have this in their back yard. It just seems to be getting worse. I can’t win and it’s so frustrating. 'I don’t look out of my window anymore I’m at my wits end. I have blinds so I can’t see out at that eyesore.' Neighbour Diane Hargreaves said: 'I knew V10 was there when I moved in, but cannot believe how bad it is. 'The view is dreadful and the noise from lorries, especially in the morning is terrible. I want the company or the council to do something about it. Even a wall or screen between us and the recycling site would be an improvement.' V10 Polymers which handles in excess of 5,000 tonnes of plastic scrap per year has been operating legally at the site for many years and is not controvening any planning rules. It said its recycling operations met Environment Agency and borough requirements. Manager David Holt said: 'We have controlled facilities for our waste and the items that we recycle disposed of accordingly. And as for the rats we are situated right next to the canal.'

"Cosy knits, winter coats and sparkles are hot looks for Fearne this season . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 11:59 EST, 30 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:16 EST, 30 November 2012 . Even at six months pregnant, Fearne Cotton still manages to look bang on trend. From her cosy yet cool fur coats to her kooky knitted hats, the Very designer and presenter never has a fashion faux pas. And now, she has passed on her words of wisdom speaking exclusively to FEMAIL about her winter wardrobe staples. The presenter turned designer always has her style bang on trend and now she shares her secrets with FEMAIL . What are your three winter clothing staples? Good pair of tights, definitely – couldn’t live without them. A good pair of boots, like I say those studded ones I’ve been wearing to death at the moment. And just a really good, durable winter coat that still looks nice, so something faux fur or a nice tailored, warm coat. What are your favourite winter party wear trends this year? Over the years Christmas-wise we’ve done some really fun stuff, and you can be a bit extra glitzy and glam, so I’ve done some that have been full-on sequins, I did one with a big bow on it, like a sequin dress that’s really cute. One year I did this black dress with a big white sequin bow on it, so I think it’s an opportunity to wear stuff that’s slightly camper and more glitzy, so yeah, sequins and glitz. Fearne's love of sequins was chanelled through her Children in Need dress that added some real sparkle to the stage . Have you got your ‘Christmas party’ look planned? It’s so difficult, I was looking for something glitzy to wear for Children In Need but it’s very challenging having a body that doesn’t fit normal clothes at the moment. So yeah, I guess it’s just about being inventive, and probably more about a plain dress with a big, bejewelled necklace, something like that is probably going to be my winter staples this year. Are there any fashion pieces on your Christmas wishlist this year? It’ll probably unfortunately be slippers because I’ll want to just be hibernating for a little while at Christmas. But yeah I can’t get enough of big, cosy jumpers, so knitwear at the moment, anything like that. And just good winter coats, can’t have too many of those – and also hats, love a winter hat, maybe a little beret or something like that. Are you a last-minute Christmas gift buyer, or do you plan way in advance? I’m doing my Christmas gift shopping right now, as we speak, I’m getting it done, I’m not leaving it until the last minute this year, no way. I never usually leave it to the last minute but I usually do it in December. But this year I want it all done in November, so that’s my aim and my goal. Have you ever/would you ever consider spending Christmas abroad somewhere hot and sunny? I never have. I’ve gone away for New Year most years but never for Christmas because for me it’s all about family and getting all of us out anywhere would be a nightmare because there’s so many of us. So for me Christmas is more about who I’m with rather than where I’m with, but if someone wants to take all of the Cottons away one year to a tropical island I’m not going to say no! Cosy knitwear and big cardigans are on Fearne's wish list this Christmas . How will you be spending Christmas and New Year’s Eve this year? Just spending time with my family because I’ll be huge by then! And I would have just finished working, so it’ll be a time to really start winding down and spending loads of time with my cousins and mum and dad and brother and boyfriend and his kids, so yep, just lots of food and family! What’s the best/worst Christmas present you’ve ever received? Best… I’ve had lots of nice ones, I’m very lucky. One year I got KitchenAid, which I use more than anything I own, so that was a pretty good one. The worst… I’m not going to say it was the worst, but the most unusual was my mum once sponsored me a tree in the New Forest. Which is weird considering I will never see that tree, but it’s there and I sponsor it, so that was quite a while back now. We love your Christmas collection for Very - what’s your favourite piece/piece that you’ve worn the most that you have designed? I always go on things that I’ve worn the most, and the two things that I’ve definitely worn the most are the black boots with all the studs up the back, I’ve worn to the point of them falling apart. And there was another pair of black boots, I think it was my second collection ages ago, that are just plain black flat boots, and I wore them so much that at Reading this year they fell apart and I had to leave them there, and I was like ‘But I can’t get these again because they don’t sell them anymore! Oh my god!’ and I had to just put them in the bin, I was so upset about it. So those two pairs of boots I wore loads, and also in the Autumn/Winter stuff that’s on sale now, there’s a cream faux fur coat that I wear all the time because it’s so cosy and looks really glam and 50s, so I’ve worn that loads and loads. Last Christmas saw Fearne's very collection go retro with a Debbie Harris inspired look . And it’s always those pieces that I know – because a lot of my Very stuff, because obviously there’s so much of it coming in each season, and I wear as much of it as I can, I’ll put a lot of it in storage so I can give it to my kids one day or whatever. And it all goes flat-pack in boxes, but then there’s some pieces that never go in, like this cream coat definitely won’t, the boots won’t, a couple of the duffel coats from before I always keep out because I know that I’ll wear them each year, so it’s nice to have stuff that isn’t disposable, that will come back each Winter or Spring/Summer. Have you got into using blogs for inspiration? I do a bit, I tend to more so look at fashion shows online afterwards, because I don’t really go to many because I find them utterly bizarre and terrifying (apart from my own one, of course). So yeah, I tend to look at a few blogs off of either shopping websites, obviously Very have got one and there’s other online stores that have them as well, and magazines like Glamour have a whole fashion blog. Despite being heavily pregnant, Fearne still looks super stylish . I look at magazine websites quite a lot but I try and limit my internet use for when I’m just at Radio 1 because I think the internet’s quite evil, so I don’t usually go on it when I’m at home. So a lot of mine is more like magazine research, and books and stuff, and then the odd look at – if there’s been a massive fashion show that I’ve loved the look of – then I’ll have a look through the pictures of it when it’s been online. Do you have any red carpet fashion rules? You have to walk out the door feeling comfortable and confident, because if you walk out the door and think ‘Oh my god, I feel really exposed in this’ or uncomfortable or it’s too tight, you’re going to feel like crap all night, so just walk out the door feeling good.

A mother brought up her baby girl as a boy for two years, deceiving even the child's own father, it was reported today. The Brazilian woman convinced everyone her daughter was a boy after altering her birth certificate while in hospital and christening her 'Samuel'. She was finally found out when the girl's aunt became suspicious and managed to peek under the two year old's nappy. Forged: The mother said that she changed the child's birth certificate at a registry office in Goiania, Brazil. She changed the child's sex to male . The mother reportedly claimed she did it because she had been abused as a child and didn't want her daughter to suffer in the same way because she was a girl. She told how after being discharged from hospital she scratched out the tick on the 'female' box on the baby's birth certificate and marked 'male' instead. She then managed to dupe staff at a registry office in Goiania, central Brazil, and the girl was registered as male. Brazil's Record TV reported how the mother convinced even the baby's father and grandparents that she was a boy. It is not known if the woman lives with the girl's father. For two year she kept up the deception and treated 'Samuel' as a boy, dressing her in boys' clothes, giving her boys' toys and cutting her hair short. The girl's paternal grandmother told Record TV she never once imagined that her grandchild wasn't a little boy. She said: ""I didn't suspect a thing. For me, he was a boy. Why would I think anything different? ""It was an aunt who had doubts about Samuel's sex, but she didn't tell the rest of the family. She asked to hold Samuel at a family party and managed to look. ""It was a huge shock for everyone. Now I have to get used to the fact I don't have a grandson any more, I have a granddaughter.""

Brad Pitt says that even though his mother came out against President Obama and same-sex marriage, he is very happy about the election and feels that the country is headed in the right direction by allowing equal rights to all couples. In an interview with People magazine, Pitt said that he respectfully disagrees with his mother's position and has been an outspoken advocate for legalizing gay marriage throughout the U.S. 'Sure, I believe in it. I believe in the idea of fairness and equality in our country. I truly believe it's a matter of time. The next generation isn't frightened by anything,' Pitt said. Different opinions: Jane Pitt, seen with Brad and Angelina at the Oscars, is a conservative Christian who does not support Obama but the Hollywood couple are famously liberal . He explained that while he and partner Angelina Jolie, who he called 'Mama' throughout the interview, are planning to get married in the near future, they believe that it is a right that should be extended to everyone. 'I come from a Christian family, and (gay marriage) goes against Christian beliefs, as far as what's going to get you into heaven or not. My argument is, that you may be as you believe, and it may be true in the end0 I don't think so- but let your God make that call, and in the meantime we live in a country where everyone should be treated equally, so let's treat everyone equally,' he said. Hey Mama: Brad repeatedly referred to Angelina as 'Mama' throughout a recent interview . Pitt's political beliefs were called into question when his mother Jane wrote a letter to her local paper claiming that Mr Obama should not serve a second term because he lacks moral conviction and backs gay marriage and ‘the killing of unborn babies’. Mrs Pitt wrote in her letter to  the Springfield News-Leader, in Missouri: ‘I hope all Christians give their vote prayerful consideration because voting is a sacred privilege and a serious responsibility’. Brad, 49, said that discussions don't get too heated over the family dinner table at holidays, explaining: 'We grew up with a very specific set of rules and challenging those rules has never been a closed door. Certainly our views can evolve. I don't see them as letting go.'

Dozens of MPs and peers, including nine former Cabinet ministers, today urge David Cameron to resist laws which would shackle Britain’s 300-year-old free Press. On the eve of Lord Justice Leveson’s report into media standards, the cross-party group of 86 insists that any form of statutory regulation risks undermining a cornerstone of our democracy and asks the Prime Minister to reject any form of statutory media regulation. Signatories to a letter opposing any prospect of legislation to regulate newspapers include the widely respected former Speaker of the Commons, Baroness Boothroyd, Olympics boss Lord Coe, former Conservative Party leadership contender David Davis, Downton Abbey creator Lord Fellowes and former Labour home secretary David Blunkett. Media standards: David Cameron (right) has been urged by 86 MPs to resist laws which would shackle Britain's 300-year-old free Press on the eve of Lord Justice Leveson's (left) report into media standards . They say that as Parliamentarians, they ‘believe in free speech and are opposed to the imposition of any form of statutory control even if it is dressed up as underpinning’ and question the signal such a move would send to ‘emerging democracies around the world’. The initiative was organised by Conservative MP Conor Burns, a member of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, and Mr Blunkett amid increasing signs of divisions in Labour and the Liberal Democrats despite their leaders’ suggestions that the Leveson proposals should be implemented. There is growing speculation that the judge, whose inquiry was set up by the Prime Minister in the wake of revelations that reporters at the News of the World had tapped into voicemail messages, will tomorrow recommend some form of ‘underpinning’ in law to a new Press watchdog, as well a definition of the public interest. Senior ministers, including Foreign Secretary William Hague, Home Secretary Theresa May and Education Secretary Michael Gove, have however spoken up in favour of a free Press. Prime movers: Former home secretary David Blunkett (left) signed a letter opposing any prospect of legislation to regulate newspapers which was an initiative organised by Tory MP Conor Burns (right) Senior colleagues are now urging Mr Cameron to back tougher self-regulation by a new body with the power to issue large fines, with the threat held in reserve of laws being introduced if it is shown not to work. Those among the 86 backing today’s letter include former Conservative cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Stephen Dorrell, Peter Lilley, John Redwood, Lord Tebbit, Baroness Shephard, Lord Wakeham and Lord Forsyth. They are joined by the chairman of the 1922 Committee of back-bench Conservative MPs, Graham Brady, and all of the Tory members of the culture, media and sport committee, which conducted its own inquiry into phone hacking. Crucially, it is supported by MPs from all sides of the Conservative Party, in an indication that Mr Cameron will enjoy strong backing if he rejects a call from Lord Justice Leveson for a statutory system. In its wake: The last edition of News of The World, the newspaper that sparked the inquiry by the Prime Minister in the wake of revelations that reporters had tapped into voicemail messages . Forty-two Tory MPs, led by the Prime Minister’s former Press secretary George Eustice, signed an earlier letter suggesting that new laws be considered. Last night Chris Skidmore, one of the . 42, said he had changed his mind and should not have signed up. ‘The . power of the media to chasten and criticise politicians has been good . for democracy, and must remain unchallenged,’ he said. Mr . Burns said the purpose of the new letter ‘is to demonstrate that there . is significant Parliamentary support for ongoing self-regulation of the . Press, to accept that there has to be an improvement in regulation, but . we don’t believe in going back to a form of state licensing of the Press . which we abolished in Britain in 1695. ‘A free Press, an investigative Press, is at the very core of an open and democratic country.’ Liberal . Democrat MP John Hemming, who has endured headlines about having 26 . mistresses, a figure he says is a ‘wild exaggeration’, said he had . signed the letter because it is ‘important that the Press should be able . to fearlessly speak truth’. Mr . Hemming said it was clear that his party was ‘not of one view’ on how . to respond to the Leveson report, with deputy leader Simon Hughes and . former leader Sir Menzies Campbell having expressed doubts about . statutory regulation this week.

Wonderful: The beautiful cutscenes are reason alone to check out the Professor's latest adventure . Gameplay is as expected, combining both screens to solve a series of puzzles. Thankfully, there’s enough variation to keep things feeling fresh. Puzzles range from simple ‘join-the-dots’-style outings, to the vastly more enjoyable brain teasers. Indeed, some are so difficult that you'll spend hours trying to figure it out, only to realise the solution is actually quite simple. If you get stuck, there is a hint system, although you have to search different environments to find Hint coins to pay for these. There is also the option to revisit puzzles when completed, but it never quite works given that you can remember the solution. The real star of the show, though, are the game’s visuals. The 3D works brilliantly, and the cutscenes are strong enough to be a standalone feature. There’s a real sense that you’re playing through something special, the charming hand-drawn artwork adequately masking perhaps a slight lack of gameplay innovation. Dialogue is delivered through both spoken and written means, which keeps the narrative ticking along, but some may find it’s a bit too wordy at times. The chirpy, albeit, slightly samey soundtrack may start to grate after a while, too. But this is another brilliant entry into the series, proving that the Professor’s winning formula has lost none of its charm.

A resolution to Egypt’s ‘pharaoh president’ crisis is imminent, the justice minister said today. President Mohammed Mursi’s decision to grant himself sweeping powers and place himself above the courts has triggered days of violent street protests. In the Nile Delta city of Damanhoor, a . teenager was killed when anti-Mursi protesters stormed the offices of . the president’s fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood party, Egypt’s most . powerful political force. Scroll down for video . Determined: An injured protester rests in a tent as he continues his sit-in, after Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi issued a decree temporarily widening his powers . Defiant: Protesters and activists stay in tents as they continue their sit-in . Opposition activists have denounced Mursi's . decrees as a blatant power grab, likening him to a ‘pharaoh’ and . refusing to enter into dialogue with him. But justice minister Ahmed Mekki, who . has been mediating between the courts and the presidency and was due to . meet members of the Supreme Judiciary Council today, said there was . hope of a breakthrough. Mursi says his new powers are necessary to implement badly needed reforms and protect the transition to democracy. The crisis has played out in . street protests in cities, with the Health Ministry saying 444 people . have been wounded nationwide since clashes erupted on Friday. The decree was announced last week, fueling the violent nationwide protests and . leading to a 9 percent drop in Egypt's stock market. Deterrent: Boys peep through a wall that police have built to block the streets on Sunday, to prevent clashes . Divisions: Egyptian protesters gather in Tahrir Square on Sunday following days of violent clashes with security forces and Mursi supporters . Both Mursi's supporters and his opponents have grown more entrenched in their potentially destabilising battle over the Islamist leader's decision with neither side appearing willing to back down. Clashes between the two sides spilled . on to the streets yesterday for a third day since the president issued . edicts that make him immune to oversight of any kind, including that of . the courts. The teenager . was killed and at least 40 people were wounded when a group of . anti-Mursi protesters tried to storm the local offices of the political . arm of the president's Muslim Brotherhood in the Nile Delta city of . Damanhoor, according to security officials. It was the first reported death from the street battles that erupted across much of the nation on Friday - the day after President Mursi's announcement. Officials identified the boy as 15-year-old Islam Hamdi Abdel-Maqsood. The tensions also dealt a fresh blow to the economy, which has suffered due to the problems plaguing the Arab world's most populous nation since Mubarak's ousting. Egypt's benchmark EGX30 stock index dropped 9.59 percentage points today in the first trading session since Mr Morsi issued his decrees. The losses were among the biggest since the turbulent days and weeks immediately after Mubarak's demise in a popular uprising last year. Tear gas: Protesters flee from security forces during continued clashes with security forces on Sunday . The loss in the value of shares was estimated at close to £3 billion. The judiciary, the main target of the edicts, has pushed back, calling the decrees a power grab and an 'assault' on the branch's independence. Judges and prosecutors stayed away from many courts in Cairo and other cities yesterday. But the nation's highest judicial body, the Supreme Judiciary Council, watered down its opposition to the decrees. It told judges and prosecutors to return to work and announced that its members would meet Mr Mursi today to try to persuade him to restrict immunity to major state decisions like declaring war or martial law or breaking diplomatic relations with foreign nations. Mursi supporters insist that the measures were necessary to prevent the courts, which already dissolved the elected lower house of parliament, from further holding up moves to stability by disbanding the assembly writing the new constitution, as judges were considering doing. Protestors: Egyptian opponents of President Mohamed Mursi throw stone at anti-riot security forces during clashes, in front of US embassy, in Cairo on Sunday . Both the parliament and the constitutional assembly are dominated by Islamists. Mr Mursi accuses Mubarak loyalists in the judiciary of seeking to thwart the revolution's goals and barred the judiciary from disbanding the constitutional assembly or parliament's upper house. Opposition activists however, have been adamant since the crisis first erupted that they would not enter a dialogue with Mr Mursi's regime before the decrees are rescinded. Protesters also clashed with police at Cairo's Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the mass protests that toppled Mubarak, and in the side streets and avenues leading off the plaza. The Interior Ministry, which is in charge of the police, said 267 protesters had been arrested and 164 policemen injured since the unrest began a week ago, initially to mark the anniversary of street protests a year ago against the nation's then-military rulers. Forty-two protesters were killed in those demonstrations. The ministry did not say how many protesters were injured in the latest clashes in Tahrir, but security officials put the figure at 260. Hundreds of protesters staging a sit-in in Tahrir have vowed not to leave before Mr Mursi rescinds his decrees. The two sides also have called for massive rival protests on Tuesday in Cairo, signalling a protracted struggle. Anger: Egyptian protesters hurl stones towards riot police during clashes at Simon Bolivar square on Sunday . Mr Mursi's office issued an English-language statement last night, defending his decrees and repeating the argument he used when addressing supporters on Friday outside his Cairo palace - that they were designed to bolster the country's transition to democratic rule and dismantle Mubarak's old regime. 'The presidency reiterates the temporary nature of the said measures, which are not meant to concentrate powers,' it said. The statement also pledged Mr Mursi's commitment to engaging all political forces on the drafting of a new constitution. Secular and Christian members withdrew from the panel drafting the document, alleging that the Islamists who dominate the body had hijacked the process to produce a charter with an Islamist slant. Nader Omran, of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, said any changes to the decrees were 'out of the question'but Mr Mursi might 'make pledges, vows or addendums explaining his position to clarify the decrees'. He said Mursi would hand over his legislative powers to parliament's upper chamber once a new constitution was adopted in a nationwide referendum and ahead of parliamentary elections. The presidency did not confirm the claim, but doing so would leave the Egyptian leader with the state's executive and legislative powers until around April. The move also has caused some internal discord among the Mursi camp, with one aide, Samer Marqous, already resigning to protest at the 'undemocratic' decree. Leading Egyptian democracy advocate Mohammed ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Laureate and a former director of the United Nations nuclear agency, warned yesterday of increasing turmoil that could potentially lead to the military stepping in unless Mr Mursi rescinded his new powers.","Teenager killed and 40 people wounded when a group of anti-Mursi protesters tried to storm offices of Muslim Brotherhood .

"Halle's mother says she hopes 'things calm down' after fight . Gabriel Aubry 'asks judge to ban Olivier Martinez' from contacting Nahla . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:56 EST, 27 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:05 EST, 28 November 2012 . Gabriel Aubry has failed in his bid to overturn an order banning him from seeing Nahla. The French-Canadian model appealed to a Los Angeles court on Tuesday to lift an emergency protective order issued in the wake of his brutal Thanksgiving fight with Olivier Martinez. The order banned him from going within a 100 yards of the four-year-old, her mother Halle Berry and Halle's fiance Martinez. Serious: A straight-faced Halle Berry carries her daughter's pink headphones after dropping her off at school in Beverly Hills on Tuesday . Back to normal: After their disastrous Thanksgiving holiday Halle and Nahla are settling back into their routines . TMZ reported that Aubry, 36, was not granted his request to have the order ended immediately. Instead it will now expire on Thursday. Initially the order ran until December 3, but the judge acknowledged a clerical error meant it was only valid for two more days. Should Halle wish to extend the order than she will have to appeal to the court by Thursday. Initial reports erroneously stated that the order had been lifted. The . ruling came as Halle was seen looking deep in thought and shielding . herself behind her sunglasses as she dropped her daughter off at school. Frustrated: A recent custody case saw Halle attempt to win the right to move to Paris with her daughter, but her ex argued it would affect his relationship with his daughter . Getting more legal advice: Halle and Gabriel were seen arriving at their lawyer's office together in Beverly Hills later on in the day . She . was present for the confrontation between her fiancé and former lover, . but is believed to have rushed her daughter inside to shield her from . witnessing the brutal scenes. Brutal scenes: Gabriel Aubry shows off his injuries in a photo taken from a restraining order he filed against Martinez . Halle's mother spoke out on Tuesday, saying she hoped 'things calm down'. Former nurse Judith told CelebBuzz: 'This cannot go on things have got to calm down.' And she added: 'I hope that things get better, I really hope that they do; they have got to get better.' But when asked how her daughter was she replied: 'As far as I know Halle and Nahla are fine though.' The fight followed a bitter custody dispute which saw Halle fail in her attempt to move to Paris with her daughter. Both . men have claimed that they were attacked by the other. While Aubry was . arrested and charged with battery after the confrontation he also came . off worse for wear, sporting a shockingly bruised black eye and various . injuries. On Monday he obtained a restraining order against Martinez, who he says should never have been involved in the handover. According . to a sworn declaration within his restraining order application, the . previous night Martinez had threatened him as the three watched Nahla in . her school play. Before the fight: On Wednesday Gabriel Aubry had attended a Thanksgiving party alongside his ex Halle Berry and her fiancé Olivier Martinez . Aubry . alleges Martinez whispered in his ear: 'I wish I could beat the s*** out . of you right now. 'You're lucky we're in a school right now. We're going . to take Nahla right now and you're not going to follow us.' Aubry . also alleges that when he arrived to drop off Nahla . at 10am Martinez told him they needed to talk before following him to . the car where he attacked him. He says that even before the fight things had seemed unusual. 'I . remember thinking that is was odd for [Olivier] to be there, as he is . generally not present during custody transition,' he said.

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 07:52 EST, 18 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:54 EST, 19 September 2012 . Doctors have carried out the world’s first womb transplants between a mother and daughter. Within the past few days, two women have received organs donated by their mothers in the hope they will be able to have children. The recipients, whose names have not yet been revealed, are aged between 32 and 37, and are from Sweden. Scroll down to watch the video . The team from the University of Gothenburg performed the transplant operation on two consecutive days . The operations each lasted seven hours and were carried out at the weekend by a team of ten surgeons from the University of Gothenburg. One of the women had been born without a womb while the other had recently had the organ removed following surgery for cervical cancer. Both were still able to release eggs from their ovaries and underwent IVF before the operation to produce embryos. These have been frozen and doctors intend to implant them into the women’s new wombs next year in the hope they will become pregnant. The women were ‘tired’ following  the surgery but were recovering well, the Swedish doctors said. When the uterus is taken from the donor, an incision is made in the lower abdomen. The operation consists of removing the complete uterus from the surrounding tissue. After the uterus has been detached from the donor it is placed on a bed of ice and blood vessels to the uterus are flushed with preservation solution. From the time the organ has been lifted in to the receiver it takes between 20 and 40 minutes before the new blood vessels begin to function. When the blood circulation is working effectively the uterus is connected to the patient's vaginal top and fixed in the pelvis (above). However, the team will not hail the . operations a ‘complete success’ until the women have given birth to . healthy babies. Even though the mothers are in their 50s and 60s, the . doctors believe they will be healthy enough to bear children. And the women’s bodies are less likely to reject wombs from their own mothers because the tissue is very similar to their own. Over the next few months the doctors . will gradually give the women fewer ‘immunosuppressant’ drugs, which . stop their immune systems rejecting the organs, in the hope they will . begin functioning normally. Professor Mats Brännström, an expert in . obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Gothenburg who led the . team of surgeons,  said: ‘This is a major step forward. ‘The women are well, they are walking . but are tired after surgery. The donating mothers are up and walking . and will be discharged from the hospital within a few days.’ The woman whose womb had been removed . following cervical cancer, identified only as Anna, said she had been . ‘handed a fantastic opportunity’. Writing on the University of . Gothenburg’s website she said: ‘I have been very careful to make my . mother feel that she does not have to do what she is doing. My mother, . however, is totally focused upon my welfare.’ She and her boyfriend had . created ten embryos, she added. Over the coming months the surgeons . plan to carry out similar transplants on another eight women. They . include seven who will receive wombs from their mothers and one who is . being donated the organ by her older sister. They are unable to have children . unless they use a surrogate mother, which is illegal in Sweden – . although it is allowed in Britain. Last year Turkish doctors announced . they had carried out the world’s first womb transplant, in which . 22-year-old Derya Sert was given the organ of a woman who had died in a . car crash. She was due to begin IVF treatment this month in the hope of . conceiving a child in her new womb. But these latest operations are the first time doctors have carried out transplants between mothers and daughters. Last night British fertility experts . said that although the procedure was a significant breakthrough, it . could only offer hope to a handful of infertile women, including those . born without wombs or those who have had them removed due to cancer or . gynaecological conditions. Dr Gedis Grudzinskas, a leading . consultant in infertility and gynaecology, said: ‘This is a potential . advance for a small group of women but I am cautious about how . widespread the implications will be. Applicability is limited.’ Now watch the video .","Two women in their thirties received their mother's uterus .

Chancellor George Osborne will deliver his Autumn Statement to the Commons on Wednesday . Senior Cabinet ministers are embroiled in a blame game over who is responsible for the lack of economic growth. George Osborne challenged colleagues at yesterday's Cabinet meeting to explain why they are not 100 per cent focused on getting the economy moving. Today Labour leader Ed Miliband said in the Commons: 'They were at each other like rats in a sack.' In a sign of the Chancellor’s unease at the state of the economy ahead of his mini-Budget next week, he warned too many departments do not think they are responsible for jobs and growth. David Cameron also voiced his . frustration during the weekly Cabinet meeting yesterday, complaining at . slow progress in delivering major transport and broadband projects. But some in Whitehall believe the Cabinet ambush is an attempt to deflect blame for the lack of growth ahead of next Wednesday's Autumn Statement when more grim forecasts are expected to be published. Yesterday . the influential Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development . (OECD) downgraded its forecast for growth in the UK. In . May it had predicted the economy would grow by 1.9 per cent in 2013 but . now it thinks it will only expand by 1 per cent. Bank of England . governor Sir Mervyn King warned of ‘a slow and protracted recovery’. The Office for National Statistics yesterday confirmed that the UK economy grew by 1 per cent over the summer 2012. The Prime Minister has put Whitehall . on an economic ‘war footing’, insisting normal rules need not apply in . the battle for growth. ‘I want every department in Whitehall to be a growth department,’ he said in a speech at the CBI last week. ‘And . I want every Minister and every official to understand that the dangers . are not just in what you do but what you don’t do – that the costs of . delay are felt in businesses going bust, jobs being lost, livelihoods . being destroyed.’ The Cabinet meeting yesterday saw several senior ministers singled out for failing to grasp the urgent need to focus on growth . But anger at some ministers dragging . their feet erupted at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting, with individual . ministers singled out of criticism. Communities . Secretary Eric Pickles, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and . Business Secretary Vince Cable were among those targeted. Downing . Street is growing increasingly frustrated that some ministers do not . think it is their responsibility to react to the economic threat posed y . the likes of China and Brazil. Cabinet ministers singled out for criticism at yesterday's meeting included (left to right) Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, Culture Secretary Maria Miller, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith . Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions . Secretary, is under pressure after his flagship £5billion Work . Programme helped just 2.3 per cent of participants into a long-term job . in its first year. A No. 10 source said: 'The PM and Chancellor are a hundred per cent focused on making sure Britain succeeds in the global race. ‘We have countries around the world like China, India and Brazil, that are forging ahead, and we can't afford to have UK government departments not doing everything they can to support economic growth.' Culture . Secretary Maria Miller was in the firing line for delays in delivering . high speed broadband to the whole country, though she countered that Mr . Osborne was using out of date figures. At Prime Minister Question's today, Mr Miliband seized on reports of the Cabinet blame game.'Look, we know in reality what happened in yesterday’s cabinet – they were at each other like rats in a sack... the Prime Minister is doing what he does best – he is blaming everyone else for a failure.' Mr Miliband attacked Mr Cameron: 'His welfare programme is failing; his welfare reform programme is failing because there isn’t the work and his economic strategy. He’s got a Work Programme that isn’t working, a growth strategy that is not delivering and a deficit that is rising.' But the PM said Mr Miliband had worked in a Labour government under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown 'where the Prime Minister and the Chancellor couldn't be in the same room as each other, rats in a sack doesnt' even do it'.","David Cameron and George Osborne single out ministers at Cabinet meeting for not focusing on jobs and growth .

She has now become favourite to win the competition, alongside shy singer Jahmene Douglas, who also managed to wow after battling his shyness.

Many parents refused to have their . children vaccinated after Dr Andrew Wakefield’s 1998 research linked the . MMR jab with autism. His study has since been discredited. Children should receive their first . dose of MMR between 12 and 13 months and then a second dose between . three years four months and five years. Experts welcomed the increase but . pointed out it is still short of the World Health Organisation’s target . of at least 95 per cent of children being vaccinated. In London the figure is significantly lower, with just 86.1 per cent of children under two having the first MMR jab in 2011-12. The uptake was highest in Thames Valley, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight where 93.5 per cent of children were vaccinated, according to the HSCIC’s NHS immunisation statistics report. The uptake of the vaccination programme has varied over the last two decades. HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said: 'Our annual figures have tracked the course of immunisation coverage for several vaccines for children over the years including that for measles, mumps and rubella. 'Today’s report marks a significant point in the continued rise of MMR coverage since it hit a low in 2003-04 - as for the first time in 14 years nine out of 10 children in England have had the MMR vaccine before they turn two. 'However, although MMR coverage at two years has risen in all regions of England, and overall the country’s coverage has increased in recent years, the national figure remains below the WHO target of at least 95 per cent.' Prof Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics, University of Bristol, said the upward trend for MMR uptake was encouraging. However, he added: 'Measles cases are still occurring at much higher levels than previously. There are a lot of older children of different ages out there who missed one or both MMR doses over the last 15 years and they are vulnerable and able to pass the infection on to others. 'Measles is extremely infectious and only with continuous vaccine uptake rates at 95 per cent and above over many years can it come under effective control. We also need to keep our eyes open for cases of mumps and rubella and congenital rubella going forward. 'Any parents who decided against MMR in the past should now reconsider having their children immunised and contact their GP.'","Nine in 10 children under the age of two .

Egypt's Muslim-led assembly has raced through approval of a new draft constitution without the participation of liberal and Christian members. Critics fear the move, which saw the assembly vote unanimously to retain the principles of Islamic law as the main source of legislation, could lead to restrictions on women's rights and freedom of speech. The draft charter is at the heart of the struggle between Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi and opposition parties that was sparked when the Muslim Brotherhood leader granted himself sweeping new powers last week. Struggle: President Mohamed Morsi, seen flanked by bodyguards, sparked a crisis in Egypt when he granted himself sweeping new powers . The president's decision to put himself above the power of the courts triggered days of violent protests in Egypt. Opposition activists had likened Morsi to a 'pharaoh' and refused to enter into dialogue with the leader. The latest development in the ongoing power struggle saw the controversial draft charter approved after a marathon all-night assembly session. The document, which is expected to be put to a nationwide referendum in the coming weeks, is being viewed as the 'Muslim Brotherhood constitution', according to an Al Jazeera report. Many liberal, secularist and Coptic . Christian representatives have been boycotting assembly sessions in . recent months. Just four women participated in last night's vote, and not a single Christian member was present, the report said. Human rights activists have warned that some elements of the document resemble a 'penal code'. The new draft retains the principles of Islamic law as the basis of legislation, but adds an article stating that al-Azhar, Egypt's leading Islamic institution, must be consulted on matters related to Sharia. It says the state will protect the 'true nature of the Egyptian family' and promote its 'morals and values'. The document also states that a woman must balance her duties towards her family with those towards outside work, implying that a woman could be held accountable if her public role is deemed to be in conflict with her duty towards her family. Tahrir Square: Thousands of demonstrators filled Cairo's Tahrir Square to protest against Morsi's assumption of broad new powers . The charter will replace the one suspended when President Hosni Mubarak's regime was overthrown in 2011. The president has been locked in a stand-off with senior judges in Egypt since he issued an emergency decree last week which said his decisions could not be revoked by any authority - including the judiciary. Morsi has insisted the decree was a temporary emergency measure, but opponents have described his assumption of new powers as 'dictatorial', and the high appeals court - known as the Court of Cassation -  went on strike in protest. Thousands of Egyptians also took to the streets in cities across the country as pressure mounted on the president to rescind his decrees. Last night's marathon assembly session has further fuelled outrage Morsi, whose actions have led pro-democracy activists to claim he is acting too much like Hosni Mubarak, the authoritarian leader he replaced.","Egypt's Muslim dominated assembly hurriedly approved a draft constitution that will retain the principles of Islamic law as the main source of legislation .

At its peak, it was a bustling town manufacturing millions of wooden doors to cater for the housing boom in Spain. But all that’s left now is a ghost town with an abandoned factory that is a stark reminder of more prosperous times. Villacanas is one of the many former buoyant industrial Spanish towns that is now struggling with huge unemployment problems. Stark: The sun rises over Villacanas, 55 miles from Madrid. At its peak, it was a buoyant manufacturing town making millions of wooden doors . Abandoned: The terrain of the Mavisa door factory is strewn with rubbish. During the boom years, the factory employed 5,700 people and produced seven million wooden doors a year . Destroyed: Material is scattered around an old working bench inside the abandoned Mavisa door factory. Since its closure, the town of Villacanas has been struggling with huge unemployment problems . Between 2001 and 2007, Spain was leading the property boom in Europe with prices increasing annually at an average of around 13 per cent. Around 800,000 houses were being built a year and the people of Villacas were part of Spain’s middle class enjoying high wages and permanent jobs. During the construction boom, the majority of doors used with the new developments were made in this small industrial town. Approximately seven million doors a year were once assembled at the Mavisa factory which employed a workforce of almost 5,700 people. Desolate: The state of the Mavisa door factory is a stark reminder of more prosperous times when the population of Villacanas was part of Spain's middle class enjoying high wages and permanent jobs . Bleak outlook: A man crosses an old bridge leading to the other side of the railroad track in Villacanas. Times now are different from the boom years when Spain was building some 800,000 houses a year . Shutting up shop: A market salesman packs up his unsold vegetables after a day on the local market . Empty: A neon sign illuminates on a bar in Calle Mayor. The town has been left desolate with the Villacanas industrial park now empty and redundant . Quiet: A pedestrian crosses the street devoid of traffic. With Spain in the grip of recession and the housing bubble burst, Villacanas is typical of many former buoyant industrial Spanish towns now struggling with huge problems . Then the economic downturn hit in 2008. The Spanish government estimates that over 780,000 houses built since 2005 have not been sold. The housing bubble has burst and the country is in the grip of recession. Meanwhile, the town has been left almost desolate with the Villacanas industrial park now empty and redundant. The town is reminiscent of the country’s situation as a whole. The unemployment rate in Spain stands at 25 per cent with more than half of young people out of work . Between July and September 2012, 85,000 more people joined the ranks of the unemployed raising the total to 5.78 million, according to the National Statistics Institute.

Over the past 12 months some 800,000 people have lost their jobs, proving that the economic crisis is tightening its grip on the country. Spain is under pressure to ask for outside aid to help deal with its debts. The country is in its second recession in three years. It has already been granted a 100 billion Euro bailout for its troubled banks while many of its regional governments are also in bad financial shape. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government, which pledged to reduce unemployment in its electoral campaign last year, has introduced austerity measures and financial and labour reforms to convince investors it has a grip on its accounts but they have yet to show any positive effect on the economy.

The unemployment rate stands at 25 per cent and more than half of young people are out of work . Organisations such as the Spanish Red Cross and the Catholic Church charity organisation Caritas say unemployment and the austerity measures are leaving tens of thousands of people in need of food and financial help. There are now 1.8million households in Spain in which no one has work.

He is known for his cool on-screen persona as much as for his frosty off-camera feuds. And now TODAY show host Matt Lauer is upset that executive producer Jim Bell is being phased out for Alexandra Wallace, sources told RadarOnline. A source close to the situation exclusively told the website that the longstanding co-host of TODAY is ‘not happy that Bell…has been forced out,’ adding that Lauer never had a good working relationship with Wallace, who is a longtime supporter of ousted Ann Curry. Off with the old: Jim Bell (left, at a NYC event in Oct. 2010) is expected to . leave his role as executive producer at the Today show. Alexandra .

Wallace, who previously worked with . NBC News and CBS, will also challenge Lauer’s wish to use only NBC-paid . experts to remark on current events, the source said, so as to be more . applicable to TODAY’s viewers. A spokesperson for NBC did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment. Mr Bell, who had worked for the show . since 2005, was responsible for the choice to broadcast this summer’s . Olympics on a delay, so that the events shot live in London would then . be shown at prime time in the U.S. The executive decision caused . outrage, as viewers missed out on London’s Opening Ceremonies, gymnast . Gabby Douglas’ stunning gold medal-winning performance, and sprinter . Usain Bolt’s 100m victory hours after they actually happened. Bell will go on to be the full-time executive producer of the network's Olympic coverage. He was also responsible for what many . thought was an offensive overlook of a national moment of silence on . the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Rather than . airing the moment, the TODAY show aired a segment with Kardashian . matriarch Kris Jenner talking about her breast implants. Wrong direction? Matt Lauer, pictured today with Harry Styles of One Direction, left, and Savannah Guthrie, right; Lauer is said to be upset over the new executive producer . Smiling: Matt Lauer attended TIME's Person of the Year panel on Tuesday in New York . NBC is expected to officially announce . the departure of Bell soon, after the morning program lost its 16-year . consecutive ratings win to the competition. The . set at Studio 1A in New York's Rockefeller Center has been in a state . of constant flux, with a revolving door among the cast and a lack of . viewer confidence in the show that once dominated morning television. New York Times media reporter Brian Stelter broke the news on Monday, citing unnamed sources who said Alexandra Wallace, now a senior vice president of NBC News, will succeed Bell and become the first female EP of the morning program. Sources suggested to the Associated Press that Wallace will assume the role on an interim basis, while the Peacock Network searched for a replacement. But NBC insiders have remained tight-lipped about when the forthcoming changes could take effect at 30 Rock. Stelter spun the story on Twitter to highlight the fact that Bell is expected to assume a full time role producing the upcoming Olympics but the move is seen as a clear sign that Bell is taking the fall for the pandemonium on set that has been turning off viewers. Bad morning: After rumors of tension on the set, Ann Curry announced on June 28th that she was leaving the Today Show in an emotional farewell that left viewers squeamish . Not pleased: Though Matt Lauer tried to assure Curry of her contributions to the show, it was clear to viewers that she was shown the door . Bell, who started his career as a sport's producer, took the helm at Today seven years ago - taking on the role when the show was at the height of its success in 2005. The program has long been seen to be untouchable with its 16-year lead among viewers but ABC's Good Morning America has given the NBC show a run for their money. In April, Today lost in the ratings battle to GMA, which has grown in popularity among the am sect with its full-loving crew of Robin Roberts and George Stephanopoulos. In response to the crushing loss, Today said farewell to Ann Curry, who was crowned the co-host of the show in 2011 after serving as the newsreader for years, but her unceremonious exit did not sit well with viewers. 'This is not as I expected to ever leave this couch,' she said on June 28, when she gave an emotional goodbye to viewers. Rumors were rampant that Matt Lauer, the long serving co-host, had been unhappy with Curry's performance and had pushed for her departure but Bell came forward as the fall guy, saying he had decided to push Curry out. 'We made some tough calls,' Bell told The Hollywood Reporter in a soul-baring interview in September. Winning: Good Morning America raced ahead of Today in the ratings. The GMA crew (pictured in August left to right) Josh Elliott, Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Lara Spencer enjoy their newfound success . 'I think it’s really unfortunate how that played out,' he continued about the drama over Curry's ouster. 'Obviously the transition didn't go quite as we had hoped,' he conceded, admitting that viewers may have been turned off by how the episode played out. 'Matt, I need to say for the record, . really should not bear any of the blame for that. I’m the executive . producer of the show. He’s not. He’s the public face of the show, so . he’s taken some of this. But it has been wrong. And that fact should be . corrected.' 'I think it’s really unfortunate how that played out. Obviously the transition didn't go quite as we had hoped' -Jim Bell in September about the network's changes to the show . Despite the bad press about the show's direction, he expressed confidence (at least, at that time) in the future. 'We’re taking some shots. But that’s OK. We have the right team in place now. We’re just trying to move forward here.' But . even with his assurances that Lauer was not the bad guy, Lauer became . cast as a bit of a diva when reports emerged he negotiated a lucrative . contract, estimated at $25 million, that reportedly allowed him to cut . back on his work schedule despite his pay increase. Former . lawyer turned cheery TV personality, Savannah Guthrie, was named . Curry's replacement in July and even with her girl-next-door charm and . astute reporting abilities, the show has continued to struggle alongside . the competition. Tension: Savannah Guthrie (left) joined the show this summer but Matt Lauer has reportedly been micromanaging decisions on set, frustrating the rest of the crew . Bad timing? At the precise moment that CBS and ABC were broadcasting the moment's . silence to commemorate 9/11 from, NBC's TODAY show was airing an interview with Kris Jenner about breast implants . Users of Twitter took to the social networking site to express their disgust over the perceived lack of respect from NBC in broadcasting an interview with Kris Jenner instead of the 9/11 moment of silence at 8.46. a.m. After taking a hit to their ratings, Lauer . addressed the show's decline in a CNN interview in May and took . responsibility for its lackluster performance. ‘Perhaps we have let up on in the . past couple of years ... the competition is tougher and there are a lot . of challenges out there,’ he said on Piers Morgan Tonight on May 30. 'When people start to write articles . about what might be wrong with the Today show you know where you should . point the finger, point it at me because I have been there the longest. And it's my responsibility,’ he added. But with a new side-kick, reports circulated that Lauer saw himself as the show's savior and began micromanaging decisions on set at 30 Rock, much to the chagrin of the show's crew.","Executive producer Jim Bell fired after ratings have continued to drop .

Good news: A pill that could save the lives of thousands suffering from a common heart condition has been approved for use on the NHS. This picture is posed by models . A pill that could save the lives of thousands suffering from a common heart condition has been approved for use on the NHS. Ivabradine slows heart rate and improves its pumping ability, with trial data showing it cuts deaths by at least 17 per cent. Around one in five of the 900,000 Britons with heart failure – almost 200,000 patients – could benefit from treatment costing around £1.40 a day, say specialists. The pill, which could also slash NHS costs by cutting hospital admissions by more than a quarter, will be available in three months. The NHS drug rationing body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, says the drug will not only save lives, it will improve the quality of life for those with chronic heart failure. It will be prescribed to patients whose condition is worsening despite the use of existing medication, or who cannot tolerate it. Professor Martin Cowie, who was involved in running a major trial of 6,500 patients, said many who cannot take beta blockers, standard drugs used to reduce the heart rate, are likely to benefit. The consultant cardiologist and specialist in heart failure at the Royal Brompton Hospital, said: ‘Heart failure is a very common problem and this is good news for a large number of patients. ‘We have results showing ivabradine not only improves symptoms and prevents disease progression, but also helps patients return to normal daily activities and increases their enjoyment of life.’ The guidance applies in England and Wales – the drug regulatory body in Scotland made a similar decision last week. Heart specialists have previously estimated that prescribing ivabradine could save between 5,000 and 10,000 lives a year. Ivabradine, also known as Procoralan, was licensed for angina five years ago and is taken by around 20,000 NHS patients. More than 700,000 people over the age of 45 live with heart failure, which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently. Around 100,000 a year are thought to die from it and an estimated 68,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles.",Ivabradine slows heart rate and improves its pumping ability .

A treasure haul salvaged from a sunken Spanish galleon sunk by British warships in 1804 was unveiled today. The loot was found in the wreck of Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes and had been at the centre of a five-year legal battle between a U.S. salvage company and Spain. US firm Odyssey Marine Exploration found the lost treasure off Portugal's Atlantic coast in 2007. At the time, the treasure was estimated to be worth $500m (£316m). Treasure haul: A block of encrusted silver coins from the shipwreck of a 1804 galleon, on its first display to the media at a ministry building, in Madrid . Discovery: A worker holds up a gold tobacco box from the shipwreck of a 1804 galleon . Treasure trove: A block of encrusted silver coins - the inventory counted 574,553 silver coins and 212 gold coins .

Only a tiny portion of the haul from the galleon that sank off Portugal's . Atlantic coast near the straits of Gibraltar was shown to the . media - 12 individual silver coins, a block of encrusted silver coins . stuck together after centuries underwater, two gold tobacco boxes and a . bronze pulley. Authorities who have been inventorying the treasure since it was flown from Florida to Spain in February said it will be transferred later this year from Madrid to the National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in the Mediterranean city of Cartagena. Precious: The trove is worth an estimated $500 million . Viewing: Displays are expected to start next year, with some items put on rotating temporary displays at museums across the country . Battle: Spain took possession of the treasure after courts rejected arguments that Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration was entitled to all or most of the treasure . Find: Officials said that the weight of the treasure was not the 17 tons reported during the legal fight because that included a ton of sea water used to help preserve many of the silver coins in storage containers . Displays are expected to start next year, with some items put on rotating temporary displays at museums across the country. Though . previous estimates have put the value of the treasure at $500 million, . Spanish officials said they weren't trying to determine an amount . because the haul is part of the nation's cultural heritage and can never . be sold under Spanish law. 'It's invaluable,' said Elisa de Cabo, the Culture Ministry's deputy director of national heritage. 'How would you put a price on the Mona Lisa?"" Hands on the haul: Spanish military personnel load a Hercules with some of the 594,000 coins and artifacts recovered by U.S. treasure hunters from the ship in 2007 .

Keeping track: A member of Spain's Culture Ministry documents one of the coins from the sunken Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes earlier this year . Spain took possession of the treasure after courts rejected arguments that Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration was entitled to all or most of the treasure.

Trove: This picture shows hundreds of the silver coins recovered by Odyssey from the seabed off the coast of Portugal . Hunting the loot: Crew members of the Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration used a remote-controlled submersible to bring the coins to the surface . The Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was sunk by British warships off the coast of Portugal during the Battle of Cape Santa Maria in 1804 while sailing back from South America with more than 200 people on board. Spain was a neutral country at the time, but had been showing signs of declaring war in alliance with Napoleonic France. The galleon was ordered to change course towards England, but its senior Spanish officer refused and opened fire on the British. Tales recount that the Mercedes broke 'like an egg, dumping her yolk into the deep' after the attack Most of the survivors were rescued from one or two small boats. The English Prize Office removed 4,773,153 gold and silver pesos from three captured ships, 1,307,634 of which belonged to the king of Spain. After the incident, Spain declared war on England. The inventory counted 574,553 silver coins and 212 gold coins. Odyssey had argued that the wreck was . never positively identified as the Mercedes. And if it was that vessel, . the company contended, then the ship was on a commercial trade trip — . not a sovereign mission — at the time it sank, meaning Spain would have . no firm claim to the cargo. I . nternational treaties generally hold that . warships sunk in battle are protected from treasure seekers. Odyssey . lost every round in federal courts as the Spanish government painted . the company as modern-day pirates. The company has said in earnings . statements that it has spent $2.6 million salvaging, transporting, . storing and conserving the treasure.# . The metals were mined and the coins minted in the Andes, from places that are now in Bolivia, Chile and Peru. How it all started: This painting shows the Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes being sunk by the Royal Navy as it makes it way back from South America in 1804 . Spain overcame a last-minute effort by the Peruvian government to block the transfer of the treasure back to Spain. Peru did not gain its independence . until 1824, but the country's lawyers argued it was more than a simple . colony at the time because it was the local seat of the Spanish crown . when the ship sank. Spain's Queen Sofia promised in a visit to Bolivia several months ago that some of the treasure would be loaned to the country for display in museums.","Loot found in the wreck of Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 08:52 EST, 19 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:56 EST, 19 November 2012 . The former girlfriend of software mogul John McAfee, who has evaded authorities in Belize since they named him a 'person of interest' in his neighbour's murder, has revealed he is living 'in constant fear'. The woman, who would only identify herself as 'Francesca', spoke out as police dug up the remains of McAfee's four dogs, who were found poisoned days before his neighbour, American businessman Gregory Faull, was found shot in the head. McAfee is believed to have shot the dogs to put them out of their misery and police are now investigating whether the same type of bullets killed the animals and Mr Faull. Francesca said she has spoken regularly with McAfee, 67, since he disappeared a week ago. On the run: Antivirus mogul John McAfee, seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor, claims he is being set up by the Belize government and lives in 'constant fear' 'He's in constant fear, paranoid,' she told CNN. 'I would say it's because . of what he has been through. He thinks people are always after him, . which they really are right now.' She added that she does not know where he is, but that he is not at home, as he had claimed this weekend. 'It will never be ended until John is dead,' she said. 'That's what I believe, until they kill him.' Her claims come as McAfee apparently began writing a blog, entitled The Hinterland: The Official Blog of John McAfee about being on the run after his 'harassment' by the Belize government. 'I am asking all people of conscience to read this blog, and see the ugly truth unfolding here,' he wrote. On the blog he also claims that he . has dyed his beard and hair almost white and darkened his skin with shoe . polish in an effort to stay ahead of authorities. Killed: American businessman Gregory Faull was found fatally shot in the back of the head earlier this month . 'I stuffed my cheeks with chewed bubble gum stuck to the outside of my upper and lower molars – making my face appear much fatter,' he added. 'I darkened and browned my front teeth. 'I stuffed a shaved down tampon deep into my right nostril and died the tip dark brown – giving my nose an awkward, lopsided, disgusting appearance.' He added that he has changed his clothes, walks with a limp and speaks with a heavy Spanish accent. So convincing is his appearance, he wrote, that 'while peddling small wooden carvings, I nearly sold a dolphin carving to an Associated Press reporter standing at the edge of my dock'. Despite his fears, police say they have not named McAfee a suspect and simply want him to come in for questioning, with someone else in tow if he would prefer. 'My goodness,' Raphael Martinez, a police spokesman, said in response to McAfee's fear. 'He needs to come in so that we . can clear the air. We are law-abiding people here. We follow the laws . to the letter. We believe at this point that he has absolutely no fear . of being killed by anybody.' Beach house: The home of anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee in San . Pedro . Lying low: McAfee, is pictured at his former home in Rodeo, New Mexico . Faull, 52, was killed earlier this month . in his home near San Pedro, on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye, . and McAfee has not been seen since. Three other people have been held for questioning in the murder and police continue to investigate other leads, authorities said. Officers have searched McAfee's home and dug up the remains of four of McAfee's 11 dogs, who were fatally poisoned before the murder of Faull. It is believed the neighbour had complained about the dogs' barking, but McAfee has denied a role in Mr Faull's murder. 'He did not like my dogs,' McAfee said in an interview over the weekend. 'He was . a minor annoyance. All neighbours can be minor annoyances from time to . time but without them the world would be empty. I know he didn't kill my . dogs.' Witnesses told CNN that police only left with the dogs' heads for ballistics testing. Suspicious: Gregory Faull's home in San Pedro. Belizean police want to question anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee, 67, about the murder of his neighbor and fellow U.S. citizen, Faull, 52 . Pastime: Mr Faull posted several pictures of himself on his boat in Belize. He titled this photo 'new friends' Well liked: Faull is pictured with basketball legends Michael Jordan, left, and Patrick Ewing, right . Despite evading police for days, McAfee has claimed that he is in his home in Belize. 'I am where I am most of the time,' he told CNBC on Friday. 'I am certainly inside my compound.' As soon as the news reached Belize police they were on their way, spokesman Martinez said, adding that McAfee has several buildings on his compound and that any one of them could have hidden safe house. The revelation of his location seemed somewhat out of character for a man who's said he's terrified of being executed by Belize police. Yet his behavior has been increasingly erratic in recent days. Speaking briefly to a British newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, . McAfee, 67, denied all knowledge of the murder of Faull and claimed he . is being set up by the prime minister of the country, Dean Barrow. When asked what he thought would happen to him if he turned himself in, McAfee said: 'I think I will be summarily executed.' Cache: Some of the weapons that Belize's Gang Suppression Unit . claim they recovered from McAfee's home . Grim task: Police officers carry the body of US citizen Gregory Viant Faull following his murder this weekend . 'I know the prime minister laughs at this. He's a clever and charismatic person. 'The . constitution has been ridden away with. They can make up some excuse . for removing me. This is the way it is in this country.' McAfee added that he is now accompanied by a woman and will never surrender to the authorities. 'I wish I had a TV, that would be . very informative. I'm keeping tabs through friends. I have intermittent . access to the internet, again through friends,' said McAfee. 'They . nationalised the phone company and so they can trace calls and . triangulate. I cannot talk on this phone for long. My plan is a . day-to-day plan, simply to avoid detection.' Indeed, . on Thursday night, McAfee took to the Internet under his 'stuffmonger' alias and asked for advice on how to avoid being caught because of his . phone being tracked. Survivor: McAfee's dog Soltan and a security guard stand near his home, where four dogs were poisoned . 'How long does it take for a phone company to triangulate a cell phone signal?' said McAfee. 'With . what accuracy? Is there any way to confuse/delay the system? If a cell . phone is turned off, but the battery is installed, is there any way to . locate the phone? 'Are there any brands of phones are more/less difficult to triangulate?' McAfee . denied he had anything to do with his neighbours murder, saying, 'I was . at home. I heard nothing. I knew nothing until the following day.' The founder and creator of the McAfee . anti-virus software business said that in addition to hiding, he was . employing the use of a disguise to evade capture. However, he added, 'To say what your disguise is would be foolish.' New life: John McAfee, 67, has been a follower of alternative therapies and . philosophies all his life and taught yoga after he sold his antivirus business . McAfee's home on Ambergris Caye, an . island off Belize was raided by Belize's Gang Supression Unit in April, . amid reports that he was arming himself and running a meth lab. 'The GSU sent people looking for a meth lab that did not exist and I never received an apology,' said McAfee. 'My . experience of this government has not been positive. The GSU is the . right hand of the prime minister. It's supposed to report to the police . but everyone knows it doesn't. 'There was no meth lab, what on Earth would I be doing running a meth lab?' Earlier this week the prime minister of Belize called the antivirus pioneer 'bonkers' as he remained on the run while cops investigate the murder of his neighbor. Prime Minister Dean Barrow said McAfee was only wanted for questioning and should report to authorities. Exasperated: San Pedro's Mayor Daniel Guerrero says police want to question McAfee, who is not a suspect . Barrow also expressed doubts about . McAfee's mental state, saying: 'I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I . believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers.' McAfee told The Associated Press by . telephone that he didn't kill Faull, though he acknowledged he had . differences with the dead man. 'I . barely knew him, I barely spoke ten words to him in the last three . years,' McAfee said, speaking on a cellphone. 'Certainly he was not my . favorite person and I was not his.' 'He . was a heavy drinker and an annoyance. But the world is full of . annoyances; if we killed all of our annoyances, there would be nobody . left,' McAfee said. Tropical: John McAfee, founder of the anti-virus software firm, moved to Belize in 2008 . Other . expat residents of the island of Ambergris Caye, where San Pedro is . located, have described Faull, the owner of a construction business in . Orlando, Florida, as peaceful and well-liked. McAfee, the creator of the McAfee . antivirus program, has led a life of eccentricity since he sold his . stake in the anti-virus software company that is named for him in the . early 1990s and moved to Belize about three years ago to lower his . taxes.

The company, which was set up in 1962 by Ray Hancock and his wife Liz, saw a 20% leap in profits after the demise of Woolworths in 2009, which had been the leading pick 'n' mix retailer on British high streets. Hancocks was founded in Loughborough 1962 by couple Ray and Liz Hancock . They began wholesaling to increase profits and quickly expanded . The pair opened depots and cash and carries as their supplier list grew . In 1986, the company was taken over by sons when Ray Hancock died . Business was boosted in 2009 when sweet rivals Woolworth's closed forcing customers to shop elsewhere - including major chains supplied by Hancocks . Yesterday, the Hancock family confirmed they sold up for £50 million . The disappearance of the chain meant customers flocked elsewhere, including many of the big chains Hancock supplies such as Tesco, Asda and Morrisons. They also supply discount companies Costco and Makro, as well as newsagents, Poundland, 99p stores and Hamleys. It now has Britain's biggest range of pick 'n' mix sweets, bagged confectionery and sweet jars. Jonathan Buxton, a partner at .

Mr and Mrs Hancock moved into wholesaling in 1962 from their shop in Shepshed near Loughborough . in 1962 when he realised it yielded a bigger profit. They quickly expanded the business to include two depots within seven year. The owners opened their second depot in . Sheffield in 1969, with new depots following in Stoke-on-Trent, . Manchester and Birmingham soon after and by 1986 it boasted seven cash . and carries. The head office remains on Jubilee Drive in Loughborough - close to the original site. Popular: A sweetshop in Paris in 1853. Confectionery became increasingly popular during the 18th and 19th centuries as the price of sugar dropped . Mass-market confectionery began in the 1800s when the price of sugar dropped allowing the middle and lower classes to buy bags of sweets such as aniseed balls. During the century, traditional favourites such as butterscotch, Kendal mint cake, mint creams, sherbert and Turkish delight were born. In 1865, Fisherman's Friend was developed as a cough syrup, then a chest rub and finally as a lozenge. A year later Frank Woolworth, the founder of Woolworth's, pioneered the penny sweets. The launch in 1886 was a sell out and competitors were forced to copy his prices or lose custom. He drove suppliers down to such a . cheap price that he was able to sell sweets for 3 cents a quarter in his . American stores - that included chocolate candy, boiled sweets and toffees. Over the next 33 years, the chain ordered 4,400,000 pounds of sweets from just one supplier. The pick 'n' mix counter was not launched in British Woolworth stores until 1910 where the sweets were sold for just 2p per quarter of a pound. By 1930 the chain had become the dominant sweet shop in Britain and Ireland. In 2010, the chocolate confectionery market in the UK alone was worth £3.5 billion.","Hancocks Group, including Hancock's Cash and Carry, confirmed sale yesterday .

The U.S. consulate in Libya was attacked twice in the months leading up to the deadly attack that claimed the lives of four Americans, it was revealed today. The militants responsible for the bombings were also active on social networks, and used Facebook to issue . additional threats - including some against Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador who was killed in the strike. The information is likely to increase pressure on the Obama administration as it suggests little was done to secure the facility despite the fact that it was a prime terror target. Scroll down for video . Deadly attack: The consulate, located in the city of Benghazi, was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks . The consulate, located in the city of . Benghazi, was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the . attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 . terror attacks. The Daily Beast reported that various whistleblowers have come forward since the attack to testify about prior attacks and a series of threats, which are described in a letter from Rep Darrel Issa and Rep Jason Chaffetz to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The letter, obtained by the site, says that both the consulate and Stevens were prime terror targets because threats had been made against both on Facebook. One such post mentioned the route that Stevens took on his morning jog, prompting the diplomat to briefly stop running for his own safety. Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four Americans . The letter also mentions two separate . bombings on the consulate - one on April 6 (when two former security . guards hurled improvised explosives at the building) and another on June . 6. Neither attack resulted in deaths or injuries. The revelations came as the White House announced it was pulling all U.S. personnel out of Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city. Bomb attacks on the facility on April 6 and June 6 . Specific threats on Facebook threatening Ambassador Chris Stevens . Officials initially claimed that attack was a protest gone wrong, despite clues that it was a planned terrorist act . White House admitted last week that it knew the attack was terrorism, despite first statements on Benghazi assault . State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told The Washington Post: 'Everybody who was in Benghazi and posted there has been withdrawn.' Yesterday, new evidence suggested that there were obvious clues that terrorism was involved in the attack, despite initial claims by officials that it was a protest gone wrong. Stevens and three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods and Glen Doherty - perished in the assault. Confusion over what sparked the Benghazi violence may have stemmed from the CIA, which distributed 'talking points' to top officials on September 14. The unclassified documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, said in part: 'The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex.' 'There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.' Likely working off the CIA document, . government officials like UN Ambassador Susan Rice and White House Press . Secretary Jay Carney, said there was little evidence the violence was . planned. However, the document went on to say that the 'assessment may change as additional information is collected' and that the investigation is 'on-going.' Flames: The White House has admitted they knew the deadly assault, pictured, was an act of terrorism within 24 hours . Additionally, The Daily Beast reported that an intercepted phone call between a local militia group and al-Qaeda's north Africa arm, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), indicated that the two factions worked and planned the attack together. On Saturday, the Obama . administration admitted that it knew within 24 hours that the strike . was a pre-planned terrorist attack and not by crazed protestors enraged . by an anti-Islam film. Senior U.S. officials have now . confessed the government privately labelled the attack a terrorist act . almost immediately after it happened, and even knew that the . perpetrators had links to al-Qaeda. Assault: The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was burned during a protest by an armed group on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks . Shawn Turner, a spokesman for . Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, said that as U.S. intelligence subsequently learned more about the attack, 'we revised our . initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a . deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists.' Turner said it remained 'unclear' if . any individual or specific group commanded the attack. U.S. agencies . nonetheless believe that some of the militants involved in the attack . were 'linked to groups affiliated with, or sympathetic to al-Qaeda.' Rep Peter King, a senior Republican from New York, demanded last week that Rice resign over her statement that the Benghazi attack was not premeditated. Connection: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said last week that there was an explicit link between al-Qaeda and the September 11 attack on the consulate in Benghazi . The State Department rejected King's call this afternoon, defending Rice and saying she has done 'a superb job.' Last week, Secretary of State Hillary . Clinton admitted there was an explicit link between the al-Qaeda network . in North Africa and the deadly attacks that killed Ambassador Stevens as well as information management officer Sean .

More working people are living in poverty than families where no one has a job, a new study shows. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has repeatedly claimed he wants to ‘make work pay’ but a new report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows how a million more working families are in poverty than households where everyone is on the dole. Around 6.1million people are classed as being in poverty despite someone going out to work. By comparison 5.1 million people live in poverty where everyone is unemployed. The report said 6.1million people are in poverty despite someone going out to work compared to 5.1 million people who live in poverty in homes where everyone is unemployed . The government’s welfare bill has continued to balloon, after benefits rose by 5 per cent while earnings for those in work have on average gone up by just 1.8 per cent. Julia Unwin, Chief Executive of JRF, said: ‘The most distinctive characteristic of poverty today is the very high number of working people who are also poor. ‘Many more people have experienced poverty since the downturn, cycling in and out of insecure, short-term and poorly paid jobs. ‘Tackling poverty requires a comprehensive strategy, but overcoming the frail jobs market must be the starting point.’ The amount of money spent by the Government on welfare soared by 7.7 per cent last year. Despite the Coalition’s efforts to crack down on the huge bill, it has risen by far more than the 1.8 per cent rise in average pay for those in work. The Centre for Policy Studies think tank said the spiralling welfare costs do not fit in with the Government’s stated objective of making work pay. The number of people who are working part-time but looking for full-time employment is now 1.4 million, up by 500,000 since 2009. The number of working families who get working tax credits from the state to top up wages is up by 50 per cent since 2003, to 3.3 million. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has insisted his welfare reforms will make sure work always pays . Millions of people are moving in and out of work every year, with the jobs market more insecure than ever. Tom MacInnes, research director of New Policy Institute which wrote the JRF report, said: ‘Low wages are a drag on economic recovery and cause families to struggle with the costs they face, trapping them below the breadline. ‘Changes across five decades demonstrate poverty is not inevitable - reductions in child and pensioner poverty show that. ‘But it is in-work poverty that is becoming the modern face of hardship, and at the same time support for working people is being cut. The high level of in-work poverty undermines any idea that better incentives to enter work, the centrepiece of Universal Credit, is some kind of cure-all.’ The Department for Work and Pensions insisted welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families. The new Universal Credit, to be introduce from next year, with simplify the complex myriad of means-tested benefits. A spokesman added: ‘It will make work pay - by allowing people to keep more of their hard-earned money as they move into work - and directly lift hundreds of thousands out of poverty altogether. ‘Furthermore, for people who have been dependent on benefits for years moving into work can seem a big risk, Universal Credit will reward people who choose to go back to work by ensuring that you are better off in work than on benefits for taking that risk.’","Joseph Rowntree Foundation says 6.1million people live in poverty despite someone in their family going out to work .

They moaned that the room was gloomy with no soft lighting to make it more welcoming. 'My starter of beetroot and pumpkin salad consisted of one piece of beetroot in a puddle of pumpkin puree and was tasteless. Complaint: '""The bucket of chips"", while attractive to some and no doubt trendy, makes for soggy chips. The tower arrangement is better' Cheeky: A member complains about the quality of food in the House of Commons and then demands a discount as an enticement to come back. The redacted complaint was released under freedom of information laws . Row: Politicians have moaned about the layout of chips, the price of beer and the cost of creme eggs . 'My main course of fish cake was far too dry to eat and both main courses were too salty.' Another ingrate accused staff of making them feel like 'second-class citizens' because they had run out of breakfast at 10.30am. While a dish of kedgeree sparked a furious outburst from one MP who fumed at only receiving three quarter pieces of an egg and not the fourth - describing it as a 'petty and insulting way to save a buck'. Another major bone of contention was the cost of drinks. The . cost of a pint of bitter at the Commons Stranger's bar was recently . raised to £2.60 and a glass of Merlot to £2.35 - still far cheaper than . the cost at a typical pub. But . one patron claimed to be 'amazed' at the increase and vowed to switch . his or her allegiance to the Sports and Social club instead. Gripes: One politician complained about chips being served in the wrong formation, while the price of drinks was a common bone of contention . While an increase in the cost of Lucozade from 80p to £1.40 was deemed 'frankly stupid'. MPs enjoy a wide choice of dishes which would not look out of place on the menus of a top restaurant. However thanks to the huge subsidies they come in at a fraction of the cost.. A typical lunch menu - from Thursday, January 12 this year - included artichokes, ratatouille and olives with basil dressing at £2.05, braised pork belly with black pudding bonbon and apple salad at £2.70 and halibut and soft boiled quail egg with carrot dressing at £4.15. Mains included rib eye steak with hand cut chips and béarnaise sauce for £7.80, haddock and leek fish cake with tomato and dill cream for £6.75 and chickpea and lentil curry with red onion fritter for £6.75. And for dessert there was a choice of chocolate and orange torte at £2.05, fresh fruit salad at £2.05 or home-made ice creams and sorbets at £2.05. A selection of fine cheeses and biscuits were also on offer for £3.10. Last year a plan to cut costs by allowing peers to use the MPs' dining room for lunch was deemed contentious. Emma Boon, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said that MPs should not get subsidised meals at all. 'It’s shocking that MPs are complaining about the dining room in the House of Commons when they get such a good deal,' she said. 'Some of the food on offer is nicer than what many taxpayers can afford to feed themselves and yet it is all subsidised by taxpayers. 'No one expects MPs to eat gruel but instead of lodging petty complaints they should count themselves lucky they aren’t paying full price. It’s high time these subsidies were ended.'","House of Commons restaurant subsidies cost taxpayer £5.8million a year .

A depressed 53-year-old stockbroker hanged himself in his father-in-law’s home while his wife and children went to watch the Paralympics, an inquest heard yesterday. Andrew Heath waved off his wife and four children at a London Underground station in September as they travelled to the Games and headed back to his in-law’s house in Chelsea, south-west London. He had told his wife Camilla that he was going to fly to Scotland for a friend’s birthday, but he instead went into the basement bathroom of the home and hanged himself. Business: Andrew Heath worked for stockbroker firm Oriel Securities in central London (offices pictured) Mr Heath had moved with his family from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, to the three-storey home of Mrs Heath’s parents, Westminster Coroners’ Court heard yesterday. He had suffered from depression but had apparently made a recovery despite the ‘stressful’ nature of his job. Mr Heath’s father-in-law, Jonathon Fry, said: ‘Camilla went to the Paralympics and arrived back about 6pm. Andrew was meant to be on the plane to Scotland to attend a friend’s birthday party. Recording an open verdict, Coroner Dr . Fiona Cox said she did not believe it was an accident but could not be . certain he intended to kill himself. She . said: ‘Andrew Heath was only 53 years old. At the time he had a past . history of depression for which he received some treatment. ‘Within the last few months, his wife thought he was suffering from a recurrence. During the week he worked in the city. ‘On that morning, he had taken his wife to the Tube station, kissed them goodbye and seen them off. The family arrived home about 6pm and went to a restaurant. Around 8.30pm that evening, they arrived back at the house. ‘His wife entered the bathroom first and touched his arm but Mr Heath was clearly deceased. There was no suicide note.’ She added the death was not suspicious, giving the cause as compression of the neck before recording an open verdict. ‘He was unusually quiet. I last saw . him at 9am on September 1 when he was about to fly to Scotland. In the . last few months he had not been getting on with his wife.’ Mr Heath, head of sales for stockbroker firm Oriel Securities in central London, was discovered later that evening by his wife. Mrs Heath said: ‘We had been married since 1999. There had been a few issues recently but we had been trying to work out our relationship. ‘We travelled to my father’s house, we all had dinner together. ‘There had never been any arguments to suggest he would do something like this. That day we all went out for Chinese.’ She added that he had suffered from depression four or five years ago, but it had apparently got better - despite his ‘stressful job’. PC Patrick Marshall, who attended the scene, said: ‘There was no third party involvement. We found no alcohol or drugs and his phone showed a missed call from his wife. The death was non-suspicious.’ The coroner recorded an open verdict.","Andrew Heath waved off his wife and four children at Underground station .

Anyone caught rigging energy bills will face the 'full force of the law' the government warned today after a whistleblower claimed power firms regularly fixed  Britain's £300 billion wholesale gas market. Energy Secretary Ed Davey told the Commons that any attempt to manipulate markets was wrong, but the impact would be even more severe at a time when families are struggling to pay soaring heating bills. City watchdog the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and Energy regulator Ofgem have launched investigations into the claims, as industry insiders complained of a 'very laxly-regulated environment'. Scroll down to watch . 'Bent' market: Former trader turned whistleblower Seth Freedman claimed that manipulation is 'rife' Mr Davey told MPs in a Commons statement: 'Market abuse is always wrong, but at a time when people and companies are struggling with high energy bills, the country would expect us to take firm action if these allegations prove true, and we will. 'These allegations of market manipulation are being taken very seriously. We will support the regulators taking whatever steps necessary to ensure that the full force of the law is applied, if they are true, so that any guilty parties are held to account.' Downing Street called for a speedy inquiry. A spokesman for David Cameron said: 'If there has been manipulation of the energy market, then action needs to be taken very quickly. 'People in this country deserve markets that are fair and if there has been wrongdoing, that is totally unacceptable and the regulator should come down on those people very hard.' The manipulation of wholesale prices - linked to the bills charged to households - is alleged by a . whistleblower who spotted unusual gas market trading patterns and price changes . in September. Seth Freedman, a former City trader who worked as a price . reporter at the energy analyst firm ICIS Heren for nine months, claimed the market is 'bent' and said tighter regulation is urgently required. He said: 'As I was getting closer and closer to traders and participators in the market it became apparent that people thought manipulation was rife. Then various examples were brought to light. 'The big six are trading in the gas market, but so are banks, hedge funds and all kinds of participants,' he told Sky News. 'Commodities are traded in a very laxly-regulated environment.' Mr Freedman added that many European politicians are calling for tougher regulation to make the markets more transparent and avoid 'cloak and dagger' dealings behind the scenes. He told Sky News: 'The idea that people don't know what's going on at wholesale level will certainly raise suspicion and the response from MPs so far is that this needs to be urgently addressed.'

Struggling: The UK is currently suffering the longest cost of living squeeze in at least a century with many households facing a nightmare choice between heating and eating (file picture) Mr Freedman claims to have identified a series . of suspect trades on September 28 this year which were indicative of a . widespread problem, reported the Guardian. The date is important as it marks the end of the gas . financial year and can have an important influence on future prices. 'As I was getting closer and closer to traders and participators in the market it became apparent that people thought manipulation was rife' Seth Freedman, former City trader . The alleged manipulation is claimed to . have cut the wholesale price of gas, which therefore does not imply it . had an impact on consumer prices. The process has similarities to the . way banks rigged the interest rates at which they borrowed from each . other during the Libor scandal. The benchmark prices are critically . important because they form the basis for many wholesale gas contracts, . while small changes in the price can cost or save companies millions of . pounds. Britain’s energy supplies are . dominated by a ‘big six’ group of British Gas (which is part of . Centrica), Scottish and Southern Energy, Eon, Npower, EDF and Scottish . Power. All but one of these companies has . raised prices in the last few weeks, blaming a combination of the rising . cost of wholesale gas and the high cost of switching to green energy. Punishments possible: Energy Secretary Ed Davey warned anyone found guilty would be held to account . Any proof that power companies have . rigged wholesale prices would be devastating in terms of public trust, . while it could also lead to fines running to tens of millions of pounds. Mr Clegg told Sky News: ‘So many people are struggling to pay their bills - and gas bills during the winter are one of the biggest expenses that many families are having to deal with at the moment. 'If there is evidence that those household prices are higher because of cynical manipulation in the wholesale market, I think people will be enraged' Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister . 'If there is evidence that those household prices are higher because of cynical manipulation in the wholesale market, I think people will be enraged.

At the same time, thousands of . elderly people will die this winter from illnesses exacerbated by the . fact they are living in cold homes. The companies deny the claims and insist they have procedures in place to prevent any form of price fixing by their traders. Living cost squeeze: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said 'people will be enraged' if the manipulation is proven . The central allegation is that gas . prices were rigged to appear either higher or lower in order to suit the . financial interests of traders who buy and sell huge quantities of gas . on a daily basis. Mr Davey, said he was first alerted to the allegations last Friday and offered to change the law if the powers of regulators including the FSA, Ofgem and the Office of Fair Trading are found to be lacking.

Changes: Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint called for greater transparency in the energy sector . She said: ‘Whether these allegations prove right or not there is a huge lack of confidence in this country in the energy sector - people just don’t trust it any more. ‘Our energy bills have gone up by over . £200 in recent years and in the last few weeks prices have gone up again . so these latest allegations couldn’t have come at a worse time for . people trying to heat their homes.’ 'Our energy bills have gone up by over £200 in recent years and in the last few weeks prices have gone up again so these latest allegations couldn’t have come at a worse time for people trying to heat their homes' Caroline Flint, Shadow energy secretary . Officials stressed the investigations . by Ofgem and the FSA should not be pre-empted, however they insisted it . is important to ensure ‘any wrongdoers are held to account’. Mr Freedman is understood to have . taped conversations with traders about the unusual price changes on . September 28. These have been handed over to the FSA. One power company trader reportedly . says: ‘There’s a feeling among some people that somebody’s taking the . p*** a bit on the day ahead index. Between us I think [Company X] got in . a bit of trouble for that about six months ago.’ ICIS Heren confirmed that it had . detected some ‘unusual trading’ activity on the British wholesale gas . market on September 28, which it subsequently reported to Ofgem. Cooker: The Financial Services Authority (FSA) and energy regulator Ofgem are investigating claims that power companies are manipulating wholesale gas prices . The company said: ‘The cause of the . trading pattern, which involved a series of deals done below the . prevailing market trend, has not yet been established. ‘ICIS welcomes the seriousness with . which the regulator has so far responded to this information and we have . provided all the evidence at our disposal to help the regulator . determine what happened.’ It is believed that on September 28 prices went down by about 0.4 per cent.

Sarah Silverman's father has attacked an Orthodox rabbi who criticised his daughter's life choices. Ronald Silverman, 75, called rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt an 'a**hole,' and warned, 'don't f**k with my family'. His angered response comes after Rabbi Rosenblatt published on open letter on JewishPress.com, which takes issue with the 42-year-old's use of 'biblical language' in her Let My People Vote campaign, and assaults her choice to focus on her career rather than have a family. Dad's duty: Sarah Silverman's father, Donald, has attacked an Orthodox rabbi who criticised his daughter's life choices and the language she uses in her political campaigns . Rabbi Rosenblatt, who has since been labelled a misogynist by commenters, wrote: 'You will soon turn 42 and your destiny, as you stated, will not . include children. You blame it on your depression, saying you don’t want . to pass it on to another generation. 'Surely you appreciate being alive and . surely, if the wonder of your womb were afflicted with your weaknesses . and blessed with your strengths, it would be happy to be alive, too. He continued: 'I think, Sarah, that marriage and childrearing are not in the cards for you because you can’t focus on building life when you spend your days and nights tearing it down. 'Take your false god, and shove god up your judgmental a**' 'That is why you have had trouble forging a permanent relationship – the most basic desire of the feminine soul.' He adds: 'Nothing . you say or stand for, Sarah, from your sickening sexual proposal to a . Republican donor to your equally vulgar tweet to Mitt Romney, has the . slightest thing to do with the most basic of tenets which Judaism has . taught the world – that the monogamous relationship is the most . meaningful one and that a happy marriage is the key to wholesomeness.' The 'sickening sexual proposal' rabbi . Rosenblatt refers to is Ms Silverman's Let My People Vote . campaign, in which she uses 'biblical language' to make a counter . proposal to Mitt Romney's campaign backer Sheldon Adelson. Open letter: Rabbi Rosenblatt took issue with the 42-year-old's choice to focus on her career rather than have a family . Mr . Adelson pledged to give the GOP presidential candidate as much as $100 . million for his fight, and Ms Silverman asked him to give it to . Barack Obama, instead. Mr Silverman took to the comments section of the rabbi's online letter, writing about . the comedienne's older sister Susan, who is a rabbi living in . Jerusalem, and whose husband, Jewish leader Yosef Abramowitz, has . received three co-nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. 'Hey a**hole. Daughter #1 is a rabbi,' Mr Silverman writes. 'Not by your standards. She's reform. How dare she, a lowly woman think god wants her to be a rabbi, created from a mere rib. 'Her . hubby, three times nominated for a nobel peace prize was listed by the . Jerusalem Post as the 49th most influential jew in the world built the . worlds largest solar field in Israel. 'By the way, Sarah was also on the . list. I missed your name. Oldest granddaughter is serving in the Israel . Defense Forces. I'm sure you also served.Oh I forgot the orthodox don't . do that. You don't f*ck with my family.' He also added: 'Is your wife allowed to go to a minion or sit at the front if a bus or choose between abortion or birth. Take your false god and shove god up your judgmental a**'. An appreciative Ms Silverman tweeted in response: 'Oh, Dad! You're my hero. Where do you get such moxie??' Interestingly, a writer for The Jewish Press posted an update on the news website's blog section, fundamentally disagreeing with the rabbi. 'Why single out Sarah? Pick . on Simon and Garfunkel instead' Tzvi Fishman wrote: 'What is a rabbi doing in a place he doesn’t belong? 'Furthermore, is he now going to set out on a campaign to rebuke every . Jewish comedian in Hollywood, and every Jewish actor, director, . playwright, musician, politician, Facebook inventor, and Jewish . Federation president who married a gentile? Why single out Sarah? Pick . on Simon and Garfunkel instead.' Commenters on the site have also retaliated. Hannah Riederer, from Minnesota, wrote: 'I found this article rather insulting as a Jew and a women.Sarah Silverman is standing up for justice. This article is just judgmental.' Jason Feifer, from Florida, added: 'Thank you, Rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt, for continuing to prove that . religious intolerance such as yours is completely disgusting, no matter . what religion it comes from.' And one Californian resident commented: 'As a 44 year old Jewess who is married and childless by choice, I would like to offer this thought -- Anything you may have said in your ""open letter"" that was of value is completely drowned out by your misogynist leanings and tunnel vision.'","Rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt took issue with the 42-year-old's choice to focus on her career rather than have a family .

Paintings by Stone Roses guitarist John Squire have been destroyed in a fire which burned his art studio to the ground. The blaze broke out at Mr Squire's home in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where he had a purpose-built studio which he used to create his popular Squire's Celebrity series. Paintings of Harry Houdini and serial killer Aileen Wournos were lost in Wednesday's inferno. Stone Roses guitarist John Squire says he is 'extremely sad' at losing his paintings and art studio in a blaze at his home in Macclesfield, Cheshire . This inferno ripped through the art studio belonging to Stone Roses guitarist John Squire, destroying two of his abstract paintings . Mr Squire's agent, Vivienne Gaskin, said the performer was 'extremely sad' over the losses but grateful no one was hurt. 'It could have been much much worse,' said Ms Gaskin. 'He has got about four of the paintings from the collection in his home and the others have been sold. 'The studio was built near his home so his family were his main priority but they are all fine.' The fire brigade are investigating the cause of the blaze but believe it was an accident . She added: “Knowing they are safe, he is obviously extremely sad that these paintings have gone and he will now have to completely re-build the studio.' Police are not treating the blaze as suspicious. Mancunian Mr Squire’s Celebrity series gained many admirers for his abstract style and broad range of subjects. The Stone Roses were one of the biggest bands of the 1980s and 1990s and one of the pioneering rock bands of the 'Madchester movement', featuring groups like the Happy Mondays and The Charlatans. After disbanding in the 1990s, they delighted fans earlier this year when announcing a reunion and world tour. The news sent fans into a frenzy and tickets to their three reunion gigs at Heaton Park sold out in 14 minutes. Led by singer Ian Brown, they have so far released two albums, The Stone Roses and Second Coming, and say they plan to release a third soon. There were representations of another serial killer, Harold Shipman, and Austrian monster Josef Fritzl, who held his daughter captive for 24 years, while film director Woody Allen, footballer David Beckham and Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan also featured. Mr Squire's artwork has also adorned the singles, album covers and promotional posters for his and the Stone Roses' music. Other examples of his work include a surfboard covered with Beach Boys song titles, while he has held well received exhibitions at The Smithfield Gallery in London and abroad in Austria and Tokyo. After the Stone Roses broke up in 1996, Mr Squire formed The Seahorses, who released one album before splitting. He also made two solo albums. In 2007 he said he was giving up music for good to focus on his painting career but rejoined the Stone Roses this year.

Voters are turning away from the Tories because of David Cameron’s support for gay marriage, according to a poll. The finding casts doubt on the Prime Minister and George Osborne’s claims that backing same-sex weddings will boost Conservative chances of securing a majority at the next election. A ComRes survey published today found that 62 per cent of voters and 68 per cent of Tories believe marriage should continue to be defined as a ‘life-long exclusive commitment between a man and a woman’. PM David Cameron (left, pictured yesterday) and George Osbourne both support gay marriage, but a poll suggests voters do not agree . In a further blow for the PM, 65 per cent agree that his plans to legalise gay marriage are ‘more to do with trying to make the Conservative Party look trendy and modern’ than a matter of conviction. One in four voters says gay marriage could sway their vote at the next election. But while 7 per cent say they are more likely to vote Tory, 18 per cent – more than twice as many – say they are less likely. More significantly, the effect is dramatically magnified among those who voted Conservative in 2010 but say they may not do so at the next election. Only 4 per cent of this group say they are more likely to vote Tory over gay marriage, while 36 per cent say they are less likely. That eightfold margin has increased as public discussion of the issue has intensified in recent months. In April the margin was just three to one. Union: The PM and the Chancellor both believe the Conservative Party has a better chance of re-election if they support gay marriage (file picture) The poll comes after the Chancellor wrote a newspaper article earlier this month arguing that the Conservative Party would be wrong to drop its support for gay marriage. Only 23 per cent of all voters agree with the Tory leadership that gay marriage will help them win the next election, while 40 per cent disagree. Of those who have turned away from the Tories since 2010, 17 per cent agree and 56 disagree. The poll of more than 2,000 voters conducted over the past week also found that 63 per cent believe many of those opposed to gay marriage are reluctant to say so ‘for fear of being called a bigot’. The poll also suggested that voters see their support for legislation to allow gay people to marry as an attempt to look modern (file picture) By a margin of 45 to 38 per cent, voters do not think opponents of gay marriage are bigots who should be ignored. In another result that piles pressure on Mr Cameron, 71 per cent say ‘marriage is important to society and should be promoted by the state’. That will embolden Cabinet ministers such as Iain Duncan Smith who are telling Mr Cameron he must honour his long-standing pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system at the next Budget, rather than waiting until 2015 as the Chancellor would prefer. Another huge majority – 69 per cent – believes children should be raised by a father and a mother in a committed permanent relationship. There is some solace for gay rights campaigners. Two thirds of voters back civil partnerships for same-sex couples. And by a margin of 44 to 38, voters say legalising gay marriage is important because maintaining the distinction between civil partnerships and marriage ‘worsens public attitudes towards gay people’. Gay marriage is not part of the Government’s current legislative programme but all three party leaders have said they will support its introduction before the next election. Colin Hart, campaign director of the Coalition for Marriage pressure group, said: ‘This poll is the latest blow to a profoundly undemocratic plan that day by day is falling apart before our eyes. ‘[Mr Osborne] should concentrate on fixing Britain’s broken economy instead of trying to rip up the centuries-old definition of marriage in a desperate bid to appear progressive and trendy.’ Daily Mail, November 15 .","Poll suggests most voters don't share support of gay marriage .

A teenager who killed her best friend in a car accident when she ‘showed off’ driving into a blind bend and collided with a tree just four months after passing her test was today jailed for six months. Naomi Jones, 19, of Wesham, Lancashire, admitted causing the death of Elysia Ashworth, 17, of St Annes, by careless driving after crashing her Vauxhall Corsa near Blackpool Airport in July 2011. The pair had been close friends since the age of 13, regularly had sleepovers at each other's houses and Jones had even gone on holiday to Cyprus with Miss Ashworth's family three years ago. Death: Naomi Jones (left), 19, of Wesham, Lancashire, admitted causing the death of Elysia Ashworth (right), 17, of St Annes, by careless driving after crashing her Vauxhall Corsa near Blackpool Airport in July 2011 . Blackpool Sixth Form College student Jones, who wanted to become a teacher, admitted careless driving at her Preston Crown Court trial last month in which she was cleared of dangerous driving. Jones lost control of the car on the narrow, uneven road and failed to negotiate the left-hand bend, which left rear seat passenger Miss Ashworth with multiple injuries. She died two days later. The car hit two bumps in the derestricted Division Lane in quick succession, and an accident investigator estimated the speed at point of impact with the tree at between 30mph and 35mph. Her approach speed must have been more than 35mph, the jury heard. Judge Christopher Cornwall said the verdict should not be questioned but he believed it was not far short of dangerous driving. He told her: ‘There seems to have been every conceivable reason that you should have reduced your speed on that road. ‘There is no doubt in my mind that the considerable jolt you experienced ought to have acted as a warning that your speed was unacceptably fast. Sadness: The family of Elysia Ashworth, (left-to-right) sister Amelia, mother Maxine and father Chris, outside Preston Crown Court where Naomi Jones was sentenced to six months in prison . ‘There was no evidence of braking; only a desperate attempt to steer around the corner which failed.’ Judge Cornwall accepted she was not racing but pointed out ‘there may however have been an element of showing off to your friends in the car and those following’. 'This is an accident that could have happened to only someone like you who was driving at a wholly unacceptable speed' Judge Christopher Cornwall . He continued: ‘I do not accept this is an accident that could have happened to anyone. This is an accident that could have happened to only someone like you who was driving at a wholly unacceptable speed.’ Jones, whose mother had bought her the car as a present, will serve her sentence in a young offenders’ institution. She was given a 12-month driving ban and ordered to take an extended re-test. Jones said she was ‘completely devastated’ at the loss of her best friend. Tearfully giving evidence, she said she had broken her left arm and right ankle in the crash, requiring reconstructive surgery. She had had to use a wheelchair for two months and still had pain in her ankle. She was undergoing counselling and psychotherapy after she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Life cut short: Elysia Ashworth (left and right), known as 'Elly', had been preparing to take her driving test and wanted to study performing arts after her final year of studies at King Edward Queen Mary School in Lytham . She suffered nightmares and flashbacks about the accident. ‘There has not been a day since the accident that I have not thought about the accident and Elly (Miss Ashworth),’ Jones said in a statement to police given several months after the crash. 'I have been left completely devastated by the consequences of this accident but I know whatever I am going through does not compare to the suffering felt by Elly's family and my thoughts are with them always' Naomi Jones . ‘I have been left completely devastated by the consequences of this accident but I know whatever I am going through does not compare to the suffering felt by Elly's family and my thoughts are with them always.’ Jones was re-taking her A-levels after her studies were affected by the crash. Another girl in the car, Ellen Richardson, also suffered serious injuries in the collision but was recovering and was studying at university, the court heard. Miss Ashworth had been preparing to take her driving test and wanted to study performing arts after her final year of studies at King Edward Queen Mary School in Lytham. Scene: The car hit two bumps in the derestricted Division Lane in Blackpool. This is a file photo of the road . On the night of the crash, the girls were planning to meet friends in Lytham but took a detour when Miss Ashworth had asked her to drive past the home of her boyfriend whom she had argued with. 'In circumstances such as these there is no direct relationship between the sentence of the court and on the other hand the inexpressible grief of Elysia's family' Judge Christopher Cornwall . Miss Ashworth's parents, Chris and Maxine, had written to the judge before the trial to express their feelings of injustice that their daughter's life had ended and Jones's would continue. He said he had also read their ‘intensely moving’ victim impact statements. The families of the victim and the defendant sat together in the public gallery at the trial but today they were separated in court with Jones's parents flanked by a uniformed police officer. Judge Cornwall said: ‘In circumstances such as these there is no direct relationship between the sentence of the court and on the other hand the inexpressible grief of Elysia's family... the value of Elysia's life is beyond all measurement and calculation.’ Mr and Mrs Ashworth made no comment as they left court. Education: Jones was a student at Blackpool Sixth Form College (pictured) and wanted to become a teacher . Michael Shorrock QC, defending, said a suspended custodial sentence or a high community order could be imposed. He said Jones had to ‘live forever’ knowing that she had killed her best friend. He added it was a lack of attention, probably momentary, which caused her to lose control but the judge rejected that view. 'She has expressed genuine remorse. This offence has had serious consequences as far as she is concerned' Michael Shorrock QC, defending . Mr Shorrock said: ‘She has expressed genuine remorse. This offence has had serious consequences as far as she is concerned. ‘What possible purpose can be served in a case like this to send a young girl to prison? What she did could have happened to anyone. It came about through inexperience.’ He said it was ‘an accident waiting to happen’ with the former layout of the road, but that the ‘overwhelming probability’ was that would not have happened today after changes had been made. Mr Shorrock said her ‘supportive, loving family’ would help Jones deal with the ‘terrible, terrible’ consequences of her driving and that she had already been ‘severely punished’.","Naomi Jones, 19, admitted causing death of Elysia Ashworth, 17, in 2011 .

The numbers are in and digital gurus are projecting Cyber Monday 2012 to be the biggest online shopping day in history. E-commerce sales were up 28.4 per cent on Monday compared with the same time period last year, according to IBM Benchmark, which tracks online sales. Sales from mobile devices, which include tablets, rose 10.1 per cent. Lots'a boxes: Workers pack a shipping truck at the Amazon.com 1.2 million square foot fulfillment center in Phoenix, Arizona, on Monday, November 26, 2012 . Shoppers are expected to have spent $1.5 billion on Cyber Monday, according to research firm comScore. That would not only make it the biggest online shopping day of the year, but the biggest since comScore started tracking shoppers' online buying habits in 2001. The strong start to Cyber Monday, a term coined in 2005 by a shopping trade group that noticed people were doing a lot of shopping on their work computers on the Monday following Thanksgiving, comes after overall online sales rose significantly during the four-day holiday shopping weekend that began on Thanksgiving. ‘Online's piece of the holiday pie is growing every day, and all the key dates are growing with it,’ said Forrester Research analyst Sucharita Mulpuru. ‘The Web is becoming a more significant part of the traditional brick-and-mortar holiday shopping season.’ It's the latest sign that Americans are becoming addicted to the convenience of the Web. With the growth in smartphones and tablet computers, shoppers can buy what they want, whenever they want, wherever they want. As a result, retailers have ramped up the deals they're offering on their websites during the holiday shopping season, a time when stores can make up to 40 per cent of their annual revenue. Cyber Monday Palace: Workers pull merchandise as it arrives at the Amazon.com fulfillment center . Amazon.com, which started its Cyber Monday deals at 12:01 a.m. Monday, offered as much as 60 per cent off a Panasonic VIERA 55-inch TV that's usually priced higher than $1,000. Sears offered $430 off a Maytag washer and dryer, each on sale for $399. And Kmart offered75 per cent off all of its diamond earrings and $60 off a 12-in-1 multigame table on sale for $89.99. Delisa O'Brien, 24, of Brooklyn, New York, took advantage of some of the deals on Monday. O'Brien, who said she would rather shop online than deal with the crowds in stores, bought an H-P Notebook for $399 on Hewlett Packard's website for her mother. The company threw in a free Nook e-book reader with her purchase. ‘When it comes to Black Friday, I'm a tiny, 5'1"" woman and the thought of having to push and shove my way through hoards of people just to get cheap merchandise is kind of a nightmare to me,’ said O'Brien. ‘My mom gets a new laptop, I get an e-reader, and all without spending too much money ... Everybody wins.’ Busy at work: While Andres Munoz, left, gets shipping boxes in place, Gabriel Melendres packs up an order on Cyber Monday . Out the door: Packages ready to ship move along a conveyor belt . Chas Rowland, 34, a pastor in Vicksburg, Mississippi, agrees. He said that he prefers shopping online on his iPad. On Cyber Monday, he bought clothes at several online retailers, toys at Toys ‘R’ Us and electronics and phone accessories from Best Buy. He got at least 40 per cent off everything and free shipping on some items. ‘The best part was that I got to sleep while everyone else was standing in lines all night long on Black Friday,’ he said. How well retailers fare on Cyber Monday will offer insight into Americans' evolving shopping habits during the holiday shopping season. Careful placement: Yolanda Holden places a completed order onto a conveyor belt prior to packaging . With the growth in high speed Internet access and the wide use of smartphones and tablets, people are relying less on their work computers to shop than they did when Shop.org, the digital division of trade group The National Retail Federation, introduced the term ‘Cyber Monday.’ As a result, the period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday has become busy for online shopping as well. Indeed, online sales on Thanksgiving Day, traditionally not a popular day for online shopping, rose 32 per cent over last year to $633 million, according to comScore. And online sales on Black Friday were up 26 per cent from the same day last year, to $1.042 billion. It was the first time online sales on Black Friday surpassed $1 billion. For the holiday season-to-date, comScore found that $13.7 billion has been spent online, marking a 16 per cent increase over last year. Lost in the crates: A worker organizes containers at Amazon's fulfillment center . The research firm predicts that online sales will surpass 10 per cent of total retail spending this holiday season. The National Retail Federation estimates that overall retail sales in November and December will be up 4.1 per cent this year to $586.1 billion. But as other days become popular for online shopping, Cyber Monday may lose some of its cache. To be sure, Cyber Monday hasn't always been the biggest online shopping day. In fact, up until three years ago, that title was historically earned by the last day shoppers could order items with standard shipping rates and get them delivered before Christmas. That day changes every year, but usually falls in late December. Even though Cyber Monday is expected to be the biggest online shopping day of the year, industry watchers say it could just be a matter of time before other days take that ranking. ‘Of all the benchmark spending days, Thanksgiving is growing at the fastest rate, up 128 per cent over the last five years,’ said Andrew Lipsman, a spokesman with comScore.

Child abuser Cyril Smith groomed and abused a young activist inside the Houses of Parliament, it has been claimed. The late Liberal MP for Rochdale has been accused of assaulting a 17-year-old-alleged victim in an office while other politicians passed by. The victim said the assaults worsened over time and that he was groomed over a period of 18 months by Smith who died two years ago. He claimed that the incident in Westminster was the culmination of the abuse. He told the Telegraph: ‘There we were in Parliament . and he was manhandling me. I was and still am deeply ashamed about what . I let him do to me.’ The accusation comes days after it was revealed that the 29-stone MP sexually abused boys at a children’s home as late as 1980. Prosecutors missed three chances to convict Smith for indecent assault, despite the fact detectives 40 years ago were convinced he was guilty. Simon Danczuk, the current MP for Rochdale, who spoke out about Smith two weeks ago, said the latest case indicated the MP had been abusing victims over three decades. He said: ‘I am confident in saying, having met a number of the victims, that he went on to abuse into the 70s, 80s and even into the 90s, so he was empowered by the fact that he hadn’t been prosecuted.’ The Telegraph reported that the alleged victim, now a businessman and a father of four, was a Liberal activist and said the abuse in Westminster came after 18 months of assaults. He met Smith aged 19 when he was in a vulnerable state having fallen out with his adoptive parents. He told Smith about it. Missed opportunities: Both Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said if Smith, right, had been accused today he would be charged and prosecuted . He said: ‘He offered to pick me up in . his car and took me to the moors. While he was driving and as we spoke . to each other, his left hand moved up my leg into my groin.’ On . some days, he said Smith grabbed and assaulted him but on others . nothing would happen when they were alone. He has reported the matter to . police. The assault in Parliament happened after Smith invited the alleged victim down for a day. Police have admitted that Cyril Smith should have been prosecuted . After 40 years, officers and lawyers have now agreed that Sir Cyril Smith attacked teenage boys and should have been prosecuted. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'The Force is now publicly acknowledging . that young boys were victims of physical and sexual abuse committed by . Smith. 'Three separate . files regarding Sir Cyril Smith's actions were passed to first the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Crown Prosecution Service . although on each occasion no prosecution was pursued.' Nazir . Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor confirmed that a file was handed to Sir . Norman in 1970, which contained allegations made by eight men that they . had been subjected to indecent assaults by Smith as teenagers. But the then Director of Public . Prosecutions wrote back to the Lancashire Constabulary, who had passed . on the file, advising against a prosecution. The politician inflicted humiliating punishments on teenage boys at a . hostel in the 1960s. His victims detailed how he would spank their naked bottoms and order them to strip for ‘degrading’ and unnecessary medicals. The claims were later investigated by . police and files passed to lawyers but no case was brought against the . former MP, who died two years ago aged 82.","Smith accused of assaulting a 17-year-old while other politicians walked by .

A BBC editor took his own life after expressing concerns to his GP about the introduction of new shift patterns, an inquest heard. Paul Crompton was found dead in a country park a month after he began to work nights as part of changes brought in following the broadcaster’s move to MediaCityUK. The 49-year-old,a father-of-three, had more than 30 years’ experience at the BBC and was described as a ‘model employee.' MediaCity in Salford: BBC Editor Paul Crompton was found hanged in a country park after suffering anxiety about his changing shift patterns . Mr Crompton had been based at Oxford Road in Manchester, working on a number of regional news programmes including North West Tonight and Inside Out. But he told his doctor he began to suffer from anxiety when the BBC proposed a new 24-hour rolling news working regime with the move of programmes to Salford. The new shift patterns were presented to staff in August 2011 and meant Mr Crompton would work more irregular hours, including night shifts. He became increasingly stressed by the changes and was also worried by other issues including equipment failures at the Liverpool studios and having to travel up to three hours a day from his home in Woodley, Stockport. Picturesque: Etherow Country Park at Compstall near Stockport, where Mr Crompton's body was discovered . His wife Susan, told an inquest that her husband felt that the working conditions were likely to worsen in future. Tragedy: Paul Crompton was found hanged at Etherow Country Park. He had been at the BBC for 30 years . She said he had told her shortly before his death: 'As long as I am there they are going to keep taking.' The inquest in Stockport was told Mr Crompton had spoken to his GP Dr Monica Chandran to express his concerns. Dr . Chandran said: 'He was suffering from anxiety and poor sleep which was . related to the new work patterns which he was unhappy about.' But following a later consultation, the doctor described how Mr Crompton appeared to be improving. 'His . blood pressure was normal and he felt he was coping better,' she said. 'Things had improved and there was no evidence of depression on that . occasion.' Mr Crompton was allowed by the BBC to stay on his regular shifts after he raised concerns but eventually started the new rota last April. This required him to work blocks of night shifts, including nine nights during that month. He was found hanged from a tree at Etherow Country Park, by a man out walking dogs on May 18. Head of BBC news in Salford, Stephen Jackson, said: 'Paul was pretty quiet and unassuming, he was very professional and creative and he was an individual you could trust to get the job done and was well regarded.” He said Mr Crompton had raised concerns about how things might change under the new working pattern at an appraisal in June 2011. He added: 'Paul seemed to want to move on and had a wish or a need to move to the video library. We discussed what his job was going to be like and he had reservations about working nights.' The manager said he stressed to Mr Crompton that ‘his door was always open’. Elizabeth Smith, head of human resources at the BBC, provided a statement to the inquest saying since Mr Crompton’s death there had been additional efforts made within the corporation to encourage staff who worked nights to come forward, in an effort to ‘flush out issues.’ Deputy South Manchester coroner Joanne Kearsley acknowledged the BBC had been trying manage his stress and would have had ‘no reason’ to expect he would take his own life. She said: 'I have to conclude that the deceased has taken his own life. I know what you really want me to do is to tell you what happened and it’s not the question I can answer for you. There was no evidence left telling us about his intentions.' After the inquest the BBC released a statement saying: 'The BBC extends its sincere sympathies to Paul’s wife and children; his wider family; his friends and colleagues at this very sad time. 'Paul was a highly valued and well-respected BBC employee for 30 years. He is deeply missed by everyone who he worked with and who knew him well.'","Father-of-three was a 'model employee' but he became increasingly stressed, inquest told .

Four children at the centre of an international tug-of-love battle will be reunited with their mother. Briton Jennifer Jones went on the run with the youngsters during a bitter custody battle with their Spanish soldier father. The English language teacher vanished in October after losing an Appeal Court ruling to prevent them being returned to Spain. But 30 hours later she was arrested after being found 50 miles from her home in Gwent, south Wales. Her two youngest children Eva, 10, and David, eight were immediately returned to their father Lieutenant Colonel Tomas Palacin Cambra in Majorca, where her eldest child Sara, 16, had remained. But in a dramatic twist it emerged that Jessica, 14, and Tomas, 12, refused to go and sought legal advice in a bid to remain in Britain. They have been in local authority care since then. In a bid to strengthen their case, the Jones family released a series of letters and cards suggesting that the children were scared of their father. Last night, a High Court judge ruled that the two children could be returned to Miss Jones, 46, albeit temporarily. Sitting in the Family Division, Mrs Justice Theis said that the future of Jessica and Tomas needed further consideration. But she said the youngsters, who she has met, could return to their mother while litigation continued, having spent more than a month in care. She said: ‘Both children continue to express strong wishes to remain with their mother.’ After the ruling, Miss Jones, who will collect her children this, said: ‘I’m so very pleased but there’s a long way to go yet. ‘I love my children so much.’ The judge’s decision is the latest stage in a long-running dispute between the children’s divorced parents.

She was arrested 30 hours later and her two youngest children, Eva and David, were returned to their father in Spain . Spanish courts granted Colonel Cambra custody of the children after his 12 year marriage to Miss Jones ended in 2008. In June, four of their five children came to stay with Miss Jones for a summer holiday but did not return. They started schools whilst their mother launched a legal battle to keep them in the UK. But in October, the Family Division of the High Court ruled the children should be returned to their father. After this failed to happen, High Court judge Mr Justice Roderic Wood made a public appeal for their whereabouts and ruled that the children should be taken from her home by police and social services. But when they arrived, Miss Jones, her partner John Williams, a builder, 48, and the four children had packed up and gone. Dramatic twist: It emerged that Jessica and Tomas refused to go back to Spain to join their father (left). The Jones family released a series of letters and cards suggesting that they were scared of their father . After this, Colonel Cambra, 52, flew to . Wales with his eldest daughter to collect all of the children but only . returned with two of them. He has since accused his former wife of turning their children against him as this is not the first time his wife has abducted their children. He has vowed to keep on fighting to keep his children together. Colonel Cambra wants Mrs Justice Theis to enforce the Spanish court ruling but Miss Jones says the enforcement process should be ‘stayed’, claiming the children do not want to go back to Spain and should be in her care permanently. The judge says it is too early to consider a ‘stay’ and is still considering the ‘question of enforcement’. In a bid to strengthen their case, the Jones family released a series of letters (pictured) Pictured is part of the letter sent by Jessica to the judge in which she says she is scared of her father . Miss Jones met Colonel Cambra when he was a young soldier while she was teaching English in Spain. They were married in 1996 and lived in the Canary Islands and Ibiza but frequently returned to Llanelli to stay with Ms Jones’s family.

Angus T Jones will return to Two and a Half Men, but the 19-year-old is not expected to sign up for a further season. Jones, who branded the show 'filth' in a now viral religious video, is thought to want to show up for the rest of his schedule after January but sources say there are murmurs show bosses are not keen to have him back for a new season as a main character. A source close to the star told People: 'Angus expects to report to work after the holiday break in January. In the video the young star laughs as he admits his worried family have described the Seventh-day Adventist movement as a 'cult' 'He intends to honor his contract through the end of the season.' In the meantime Angus is thought to be spending some time with family and friends away from the busy metropolis. Jones' character Jake joined the army at the end of season 9 and has only appeared in a few episodes of the current season. 'He won't be in every episode,' the source added says of the remaining season 10 episodes. How he was: Angus, seen here with ex-show star Charlie Sheen, has been on Two and a Half Men since he was a child . 'How much they use him will be up to [creator] Chuck Lorre. The intention wasn't ever for him to be in every ep this year anyway. Now it might be less.' Network CBS has yet to pick up the show for season 11. But sources told E!: 'Should Two and a Half Men be renewed, it's 'unlikely"" that Jones will return as a series regular. You might see him for a few guest spots.' Those closest to Angus, who is a Seventh Day Adventist, say the teenager doesn't want to risk turning into troubled Charlie Sheen so became involved in the church. Friends: Angus T Jones and his spiritual advisor Christopher Hudson share a joke . 'Part of the reason Angus is so wary of the [TV] industry and so involved with the church is that he's seen what's happened to Charlie [Sheen] front and center. 'He doesn't want to end up like that. Who would?', the family friend told E! Angus issued a statement apologising, in the most tenuous sense, for making a video branding Two and a Half Men 'filth' then entreating viewers to switch off from the show that made him both rich and famous. In his statement, Jones, 19, speaks up for his bosses on the CBS show, by saying: 'Chuck Lorre, Peter Roth and many others at Warner Bros. and CBS are responsible for what has been one of the most significant experiences in my life to date. Rant: Angus T Jones rages against his hit sitcom, calling it 'filth' The document obtained by TMZ continues: 'I thank them for the opportunity they have given and continue to give me and the help and guidance I have and expect to continue to receive from them.' Without actually taking back anything . he said, the teenager attempted to appease his cast: 'I apologise if my . remarks reflect me showing indifference to and disrespect of my . colleagues and a lack of appreciation of the extraordinary opportunity . of which I have been blessed. I never intended that.' Meanwhile, Christopher Hudson - the Seventh Day Adventist guiding Jones - denied that he was exploiting the actor, as the young star's mother Carey fears. Solace: Angus T Jones told how he found happiness at the Valley Crossroads Seventh-day Adventist Church in California . Hudson, who is believed to be in his 40s, confirmed that he recorded the video in the actor's trailer on the set of Two and A Half Men last week. Jones - who makes $350,000 per episode playing Jake Harper - was seen . urging fans to 'turn off' the show, saying it would damage their brains. And speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Hudson - who runs what he describes as a . christian-based ministry called the Forerunner Chronicles -  said Jones believes that Jesus Christ is returning to earth soon - and that he feels a strong urge to prepare others for the Second Coming. He said he had spoken to Jones since the video was made public, adding: 'I respect his . mother and the love she has for her child and her need to protect him. She is concerned about his well being as are many other people. 'But Angus has not had a breakdown and I am not manipulating him. He said let's do an interview - and I turned on the camera. 'Angus is a very educated, thoughtful young man. What was expressed in the video was from the sincere heart of a young man. 'I didn't encourage him to do anything. I turned the cameras on with a young man who had a story to tell. Second coming: Spiritual advisor Christopher Hudson rallies against Jay Z and President Obama . 'He's making a stand with the statements that resonate with his belief system. 'Angus has a burden in his heart.

Game show host: Clare Balding will present a new TV show called Britain's Brightest which will test contestants' intelligence . The show will see 24 'ordinary people with extraordinary minds' selected from auditions around Britain go head to head in tasks to test the brain and examining everything from emotional intelligence to processing speed. After a series of demanding challenges and puzzles staged in studio and on location, the contestant with the best all-round mind will be crowned champion. Auditions have already taken place and the programme, hosted by Clare Balding, will air in January. Clare Balding said: 'I have always said that ""facts are my friend"" but knowing things doesn't make you clever.

She hasn't contact any family members or friends since that date and fears are growing for the teenager's safety. Her parents Lisa and Tony Pratt today made a direct appeal to their daughter to come home, saying: 'Shellz, you’re not in trouble. We love you and we miss you. Your . brothers and sisters are missing you like mad.' Her parents told how Shelley - one of six children - went missing for three days last year but was . found at a 19-year-old man’s home.

A kindergarten teacher locked a 5-year-old boy in a small, dark room alone at the end of a school day then forgot the child was there for over an hour, the boy’s outraged father says. School officials in Caldwell, Idaho, said Friday they were investigating after hearing from James Cagle, who says that when his wife found their son he was crying and had urinated on himself. ‘He was scared,’ Cagle told Boise television station KTVB. ‘You know just think about that… A 5-year-old boy.’ Scroll down for video . Furious father: James Cagle says he is outraged that a kindergarten teacher locked a 5-year-old boy in a small, dark room alone at the end of a school day and then forgot he was there for over an hour . Tough time: Cagle says that when his wife found their son he was crying and had urinated on himself . Cagle said he and his wife panicked when their son didn't come home from his morning kindergarten class Wednesday. About 45 minutes after he was supposed to be home, they headed to Washington Elementary School to look for him. Cagle said his wife and a school secretary found the boy crying and afraid in the small room in the dark, where he had apparently been for around an hour and a half after the teacher put him there for misbehaving. ‘I know that if I locked my child in a room long enough for him to urinate on himself, I'd be going to jail or child protective services would dang sure be here taking him out of my house that night,’ Cagle said. School officials dispute that the room was locked, saying the teacher would not have had a key. Assistant District Superintendent Monica White also noted that the door to the room has a large window, which allows light in from the hallway. Still, officials acknowledge that the discipline was inappropriate. Frustrated district superintendent: The teacher ¿should not have done that,¿ said District Superintendent Tim Rosandick . The teacher ‘should not have done that,’ said District Superintendent Tim Rosandick. ‘That's not a preferred practice,’ Rosandick added. ‘That is not what we would have wanted her to do.’ The district hasn't released the teacher's name, nor will officials say whether she is still employed.White also said she can't discuss what offense prompted the teacher to place the boy in the room, citing federal student privacy laws. Cagle said administrators told him that an incident report had been placed in the teacher's personnel file, and that she was still teaching at the school. Rosandick said the room is used for tutoring, where aides work with students one-on-one. It's also used for emotionally impaired students, when a child needs to be removed from a class for becoming violent. Alone time: This is the room that Cagle's son was left in . Closer look: School officials in Caldwell, Idaho, said they are investigating the incident . Neither of those instances apply in this case, however, Rosandick said. ‘What is very regrettable, and the teacher certainly feels awful about this, is the fact that the child was left in there and was, essentially, she had forgotten that she had placed the child in that room,’ said Rosandick. The district is reviewing its policies and procedures on the tutoring rooms, White said. Cagle has also met with the school principal, Steve Foley, who agreed to place his son in another kindergarten class. ‘I'm not saying I want to get her fired. I don't want to ruin her career,’ Cagle said. ‘But in the very same breath, it's my kid,’ he added. Cagle said he has had other problems with the school, including three incidents where the boy didn't get home on the bus as he should have. Twice he was placed on the wrong bus, and once he wasn't placed on the bus at all. Cagle said he complained each time. White, for her part, said she hadn't heard those reports and that it's possible school officials had not notified district administrators. ‘The last thing we ever want to do is lose a child,’ White said.

Tragedy: Christine Barrett died after accidentally downing a deadly mixture of alcohol and painkillers . A woman who was plagued for years by 'neighbours from hell' died after accidentally downing a cocktail of drink and drugs to help her cope. Christine Barrett, 58, who had arthritis in her back, died after washing down her usual dose of painkillers with alcohol to try and block out the noise at the council flat where she lived alone in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Her sister - who said Ms Barrett had been forced to suffer the anti-social behaviour for at least five years - has claimed the council should have rehoused the 'frightened' secretary, who was taking medication for anxiety and depression. Ms Barrett's GP, Dr Xanthe Cross, told an inquest her patient had admitted drinking at night time because the noise created by her rowdy neighbours was preventing her from sleeping. The inquest heard Ms Barrett - who lived on the second floor - was desperate to move to a new home and had told St Albans City and District Council she was struggling to get up the stairs because of her arthritis. The woman's sister, who did not want to be named, said: 'She sent her medical records to the council but that didn't help. It was like she was forgotten about. 'She was very frightened living there and she got to the stage where she walked round the corner and didn't even want to go in the door.' She claimed the anti-social behaviour was affecting the lives of other residents of the Bardwell Court flats, as well as her sister. 'Christine was such a houseproud woman but she had given up - it was tragic to see her like that,' she said, adding that the whole family felt the local authority was partly to blame for Ms Barrett's death. Karen Dragovic, head of housing at the council, said they had offered Ms Barrett an alternative flat earlier this year. Criticised: Ms Barrett's family claim her death could have been prevented had the council rehoused her . 'We were extremely sad to hear of the accidental death of Christine Barrett,' Ms Dragovic said. 'We are aware of anti-social behaviour at Bardwell Court and have been working with residents to take action to deal with this. 'We were also trying to rehouse Christine Barrett and she was offered a move earlier in the year.' On the night of her death on July 19 . Ms Barrett consumed enough alcohol to render her more than twice the . drink drive limit. Combined with the painkillers, it caused her to stop . breathing, the inquest heard.

A Formula 1 race car once dubbed 'the most radical ever' has gone on sale for £750,000. The unconventional six-wheeled Tyrrell P34 was conjured up by engineer Derek Gardner in 1976 for the iconic British F1 race team. Fitted with four smaller front wheels, the design was intended to improve its aerodynamics and improve cornering by giving it more grip on the track. Scroll down for video . On sale: The six-wheeled Tyrrell P34, which has gone on sale for £750,000 . In the two seasons it raced, the bizarre racer picked up a total of 14 podiums and one victory for Tyrrell. And in 2004 it was named the most radical F1 car ever, picking up an emphatic 63.5 per cent of the vote in a poll by F1 enthusiasts' magazine Autosport. Now this particular model, which was raced by Frenchman Patrick Depailler, has been put on the market by London-based race car specialists Taylor & Crawley for £750,000. The car, which has been meticulously maintained, is race ready - making it the ultimate toy for wealthy amateurs itching to take to the track. Depailler picked up five podium spots in the two seasons he raced the P34, helping Tyrrell to third place in the 1976 Constructors' Championship alongside South African teammate Jody Scheckter. Dubbed 'the six-wheeler', the P34 was fitted with two sets of ten-inch front wheels to maximise the contact area between rubber and tarmac to boost grip through corners. Although the car was powered with a 3-litre V8 engine that could muster a roaring 465bhp, the lightweight vehicle tips the scales at just 595kg. Scheckter picked up a victory in his P34 that 1976 season - with the pair picking up a one-two at the Swedish Grand Prix. But the race driver left the team at the end of the season and described the P34 as a 'piece of junk'. One careful owner: The car, which has been meticulously maintained, is race ready - making it the ultimate toy for wealthy amateurs itching to take to the track . Pretty nippy: Although the car is powered with a 3-litre V8 engine that can muster a roaring 465bhp, the lightweight vehicle tips the scales at just 595kg . The P34 failed to maintain its momentum in 1977 as Tyrrell finished fifth overall - with the model for sale competing twice in races where Depailler finished third and fourth. Taylor & Crawley's David Clarke said: 'It was an extraordinary, innovative car when it was launched and something that wouldn’t happen today. The classic car market is enormous, with people investing in them as tangible assets. 'This is a fantastic opportunity as cars like this just don’t come up for sale. It has spent a lot of time in a museum but it is all ready to go.' The car’s iconic designer, Derek Gardner, passed away this year at the age of 79. Its driver Depailler was tragically killed in 1980 while testing a new vehicle in Hockenheim, Germany. Unique: Fitted with four smaller front wheels, the design, which shocked the F1 world, was intended to improve its aerodynamics and improve cornering by giving it more grip on the track . Contender: The model on sale was raced by Frenchman Patrick Depailler, who drove it to five podium spots in two seasons, positions which helped Tyrrell win the 1976 Constructors' Championship . Keith Collantine, editor of motorsport website www.F1Fanatic.co.uk, described the P34 as unique car which shocked the world of Formula 1. 'The word ""unique"" is overused and abused. But the Tyrrell P34 was exactly that: the only six-wheeled F1 racer to win a Grand Prix,' he said. 'Just looking at this car you can imagine the shocked faces among the F1 establishment when it took to the track - and beat them. 'The Seventies was a decade of weird and wonderful Formula One cars. 'But even among that strange breed of racing machines this was something remarkably different. A classically F1 piece of lateral thinking. 'But pity the poor mechanics who had 50 per cent more work to do during every pit stop.' Mr Collantine believes the Tyrrell is deserving of its six-figure price-tag and added it would make an enviable addition to any racing car collection. 'Tyrrell was a great British F1 success story and a name that is sadly missing from the sport today,' he said. 'While this concept of theirs may not have proved to be the future of F1 racing, it’s a fascinating piece of its past.'","1976 car was fitted with four front wheels for better grip and aerodynamics .

"By . Tim Shipman . UPDATED: . 11:06 EST, 14 January 2012 . Osborne: The Government is looking at options to ease child benefit cuts . George Osborne signalled  yesterday that he will try to ease the burden of child benefit cuts on middle-income families. Families earning between £40,000 and £80,000 are expected to receive some financial relief to ease the pain of plans to strip the benefit from those with one parent paying the 40p rate of income tax. The Chancellor said the Government would announce details of how the child benefit policy would work in the next few months – after coming under public pressure from David Cameron to act. The Mail understands that one option being looked at is to raise the threshold at which child benefit would be removed from £42,375 to £50,000. Under official calculations, that would reduce the number of families hit from 1.2 million to under a million. Other plans being looked at would see the benefit gradually cut for those higher on the income scale or phased out over time. It could also be taken away from second and third children. Mr Osborne insisted he would press ahead with the policy, due to come into force in April 2013. ‘We are very clear that it is fair that those who are better off in our society make a contribution to the saving of money we need to make to pay down the debts so we will be removing child benefit from higher rate taxpayers,’ said the Chancellor. Should middle-income families keep child benefit? ‘We haven’t set out how we are going to implement that and we are going to do that in the next few months. ‘But the principle that it is not fair to ask someone who is earning say £20,000 or £25,000 to pay for someone who is on £80,000 or £100,000 to get child benefit is one that I think is very important.’ Mr Osborne was forced to make a public statement after the Prime Minister voiced concerns about fairness on Thursday. Simply . raising the threshold to £50,000 or £80,000 would not end the ‘cliff . edge’ loss of benefits when one partner becomes a higher rate taxpayer. The Prime Minister has called for changes that would alter ‘the . steepness of the curve’. Mr Cameron received vocal support . yesterday from Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who stated explicitly that . the Government is rethinking the issue. ‘We are looking at ways to make . it fairer,’ he said. Child benefit is usually claimed by mothers and polls show the coalition's plans have not played well with women voters . Downing Street wants to see changes because child benefit is usually claimed by mothers and polls show the plans have not played well with women voters. Treasury sources sought to downplay widespread speculation in Westminster that Mr Osborne would use March’s Budget statement to announce a change of heart. One official said there is ‘every chance’ details may be delayed until later in the year because the Chancellor wants to focus the Budget on measures to kickstart the economy. But a senior Government source said: ‘We are going to do it, but it’s not yet clear how. It’s very difficult but we want to get it done.’ Tory MPs welcomed the apparent change of heart. Pauline Latham said: ‘It did seem unfair for those people who have only one earner in a higher tax bracket losing the child benefit.’ But Labour accused the Government of presiding over a ‘total shambles’. Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said: ‘We have repeatedly warned that the Government’s current plans to cut child benefit are unfair and highly bureaucratic.’","Families earning between £40,000 and .

Pena Nieto has promised to govern democratically with transparency. But his first moves even before the inauguration showed a solid link to the past. In announcing his Cabinet on Friday, he turned to the old guard as well as new technocrats to run his administration. 'I don't think there is any such thing as a `new PRI,""' said Rodrigo Aguilera, the Mexico analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit. 'There is a new generation of PRI members, but they don't represent any fundamentally different outlook.' Pena Nieto has pledged to make economic growth and job creation the centerpiece of his administration, with campaign manager and long-time confidant Luis Videgaray the point person. Videgaray, a 44-year-old economist with a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ,will lead the treasury department. Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, a 48-year-old former state governor who is known as a political operator and deal maker, has been named secretary of the interior, a post that will play a key role in security matters. Pena Nieto has also promised to push for reforms that could bring major new private investment into Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the crucial but struggling state-owned oil industry. Such changes that have been blocked for decades by nationalist suspicion of foreign meddling in the oil business.","Demonstrators opposed to Enrique Pena .

Christmas Day comes but once a year - but preparations for December 25 take up almost a fortnight, new research has found. The typical family Christmas takes 12 days, 14 hours and 13 minutes to organise, according to a new study. Between shopping for presents, hanging decorations, and preparing and cooking a festive feast, the hours mums and dads devote to making Christmas Day as special as possible add up to almost two weeks. The big day: A typical family Christmas day takes an average 12 days, 14 hours and 13 minutes to organise . All that organising is not restricted to the festive season itself - the average British family begins planning and saving money for Christmas in the last week of August, while one in seven start buying gifts in the January sales. But not everybody is quite so well-prepared, a third of families leave all the work to the four weeks leading up to December 25. The survey of 2,000 UK parents, commissioned by Wilkinsons, found that nine days, 15 hours and 48 minutes is spent researching and shopping for presents. A further three hours and 26 minutes is spent wrapping the gifts, while writing Christmas cards takes up two hours and 31 minutes. A total of three hours and six . minutes is spent retrieving decorations from the loft and hanging them . up around the house, while two . days, 10 hours and 48 minutes is taken up thinking, planning and . shopping for food for Christmas dinner. A further two hours and 34 . minutes is spent cooking the festive feast and laying the table. Forward planning: Christmas shopping, left, and decorating, right, take up plenty of time ahead of December 25 . Steph Chambers, Christmas buyer for the company, said: 'A lot of time and effort goes into making Christmas Day the most special of the year, and thanks to our research we are able to pinpoint exactly how much time and effort it takes. 'So from now on, we won’t talk about the 12 days of Christmas but the 12 days, 14 hours and 13 minutes of Christmas. 'All the effort that parents put in shows just how important an event a family Christmas is. It is a great tradition and despite any stresses and strains most of us wouldn’t have it any other way. 'We love Christmas just the way it is.' Oxford is the Christmas shopping capital of the UK, where parents spend the longest time looking for gifts - 11 days, 15 hours and 54 minutes. Parents in Edinburgh spend the least time buying presents - seven days, one hour and 15 minutes. Eight out of 10 families have relatives over to stay during the seasonal period. One in 10 spend at least a week getting the house in order before they arrive, but 5 per cent have a quick dust around just an hour or less beforehand.","Preparations for a typical family Christmas Day take up 12 days, 14 hours and 13 minutes, researchers say .

As St. Clairsville High football star Michael Ferns raced towards the end zone there was nothing in front of him but his 12th touchdown of the season. So fans were all the more shocked when the Ohio teen stopped only one yard from the end zone, and purposely stepped out of bounds. The only people who weren’t confused were his team-mates, who immediately understood that Ferns had just sacrificed glory so that a teammate could honour his recently passed father. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Only two days before his football game, Logan Thompson's father Paul died of a stroke at 44 . Just two days before the team’s game against Edison High, Logan Thompson, a devoted freshman varsity player who’d never played in a single game, had lost his father to a stroke at age 44. Thompson’s father, Paul, has suffered the stroke while unconscious in the bathroom as his sons got ready for school. Logan battered down the door with a baseball bat to get to him and the paramedics came, Paul was sadly pronounced dead at a local hospital. ‘In that instant, Logan stopped being a kid,’ his mother, Daniele, told ESPN. ‘He made grown-up decisions. In the blink of an eye his world changed and he went from being and adolescent to a young man.’ Teammates: Star player Michael Fern knew how devoted Thompson¿s family was to football and wanted to find a way to ease his teammate's suffering . Before the visitation or the funeral, Logan had a football game to attend. Though Logan typically spent his varsity games on the bench, he knew his father would’ve wanted him to go. Until the last quarter of the October 5 game, the time passed like any other game for Logan, supporting his team from the sidelines. Unbeknown to Logan, the team’s coach Brett McLean had secretly urged his top players to stop short of the end zone if they had a chance, allowing grieving freshman a chance to final score. Michael Fern: With only one yard to the end zone, Fern stepped out of bounds stopping the game and setting up Logan Thompson for his first touchdown . The plan was almost foiled by two referees, who at first ruled that Fern had actually scored a touchdown. They finally relented after teammates came rushing on to the field to protest their own touchdown. As the team regrouped, McLean yelled for Logan. ‘You’re going in at running back,’ McLean told him. ‘Tell them to run 26 Power.’ When the boy, a linebacker who only rarely played wide receiver, looked at his couch in shock, McLean offered some last words of encouragement before sending him on to the field. Bench warming: Logan, a freshman who'd never scored a touchdown, spent most games on the sidelines until his teammates executed their plan . ‘It’s easy,’ he said. ‘Just follow Michael Ferns’ big butt.’ On the next play Thompson was given the ball and darted straight into the end zone through a five-yard gap between the right guard and tackle. ‘It felt like slow motion,’ Thompson told reporters. ‘I saw this humongous hole. I don’t think our line has blocked this well all season.’ Ferns went to Thompson and hugged him. Shocked: Fans who's never seen Logan's number 17 jersey on the field had no idea what to make of the last second entrant . At one end zone St. Clairsville principal Walt Skaggs broke down while at the other At the other McLean was wiping away tears. In the stands, Logan’s brother, Landen, texted Daniele: ‘Mom, Logan scored a touchdown.’ ‘Looking straight up into the sky after scoring my first varsity touchdown’ Thompson later wrote on Twitter. ‘I know the old man was watching! Love and miss you so much daddy.’","High school star gives up chance to score his 12th touchdown of the season .

Olympic shooting star Peter Wilson may be forced to quit the sport after his practice range was accused of polluting a multi-millionaire neighbour’s land with pellets. Equities trader Alastair Cooper claims that lead pellets from Southern Counties Shooting (SCS) - where Wilson trains - are raining down onto his  £6million Dorset estate, killing livestock and polluting the land. The owner of SCS fears a legal row over the issue could force the business to close as early as January with the loss of 40 jobs. On the brink: Peter Wilson, who won gold for Britain in the double trap shooting, may be forced to hang up his shotgun . The firing range: Southern Counties Shooting facility where Peter Wilson trains . If that happens Mr Wilson, 26, will have to make a six-hour round trip to London to practice - forcing him to hang up his shotgun. He said: 'I had heard that closure was a possibility but I never thought it would come to this, never in a million years. The impact would be dreadful. 'I don’t have enough money to move, so living at home is my only option right now. 'I would have to quit the sport, I would have to call it a day - it is as drastic as that. 'How many other Peter Wilsons are out there that would be affected by this?' The shooting range at Evershot has more than 450 fully-automatic traps and was an official training range for London 2012. Complaint: The home of Alastair Cooper who claims that lead pellets from the shooting range are ruining his land in Dorset . Doubt: Wilson may not represent his country at Rio in 2016 . It has been the long-term training base of Mr Wilson - winner of the Double Trap event at London 2012 - who lives just a few miles away at Glanvilles Wootton near Sherborne. Mr Cooper, a former head of European equity derivatives at Morgan Stanley, bought the neighbouring 3,000 acre estate at Sydling St Nicholas for £6million in 2001. He set about restoring the heavily-farmed land into an organic paradise where he now rears and sells traditional breeds of sheep, pig and cattle under the Sydling Brook Organic label. Mr Cooper said he does not want the shooting range to close and is simply trying to protect his land. He said: 'We are not trying to close the shooting ground at all. How the shooting ground operates is nothing to do with me. 'All I have been trying to stop, as has the Environment Agency and Environmental Health, is levels of toxic lead falling on my agricultural farmland. 'Unfortunately the lead levels have become so high on the land neighbouring the shooting ground that my crops have been destroyed, my lambs have been slaughtered and the land has been declassified as organic. Gold-medallist Peter Wilson would have to do a daily six-hour round trip to London from his Dorset home when training if his local shooting range closes . Tender hooks: Bosses of the Southern Counties Shooting facility, pictured, are concerned a legal battle could force the range out of business . 'It is not fit for agricultural consumption, there is a fear about lead contamination into the watercourse and because of that the various agencies have said that further lead deposits have to stop because of those fears. 'We are seeking to stop further lead deposits and that is all it is.' But Kevin Newton, manager of SCS, said he cannot afford to wage a legal battle against his wealthy neighbour and will have to close rather than see the case go to court. He added: 'We have been here for 53 years and we have always dropped lead on to that land. Alastair knew that when he bought the farm ten years ago. 'For the first eight years, he used to come up here for shooting lessons. Then, two years ago, he started complaining - he says his lambs had to be slaughtered, but they were slaughtered for human consumption, not because they were contaminated. 'He’s got all the money in the world, and over 3,000 acres of land. 'Why he’s complaining about only 60 acres of land I’ll never know - he’s got plenty more land and we are offering to buy it from him for three times market rate. It’s ridiculous.' He added that if the business closed, the nearest professional range would be in London. Mr Newton said: 'Peter would have to travel to London and . that’s totally impractical. You can put ranges on your own land but . it’s not the same as shooting at a professional range.' The Environment Agency are aware of the situation but declined to comment.","Peter Wilson won the double Trap event at London 2012 .

A fisherman got the shock of his life after accidentally catching a massive shark just 100 yards off the British coast. Skipper Chris Glaves and his crew were fishing for seabass when they hauled in the 320-pound thresher shark just north of Padstow, Cornwall. Luckily for the crew of the Good Intent the thresher was already dead when it was brought onboard. At 15 feet from its nose to the tip of its trailing tail, it could have decapitated a man with just a single swish. Jaws-dropping: Skipper Chris Glaves with the 320-pound thresher shark he caught off Padstow, Cornwall . Killer: The 15-foot shark could have decapitated a man with its powerful tail . The shark - a relative of the Great White - was lurking thousands of miles from its usual home in the seas around Asia and North America. But it drew a huge crowd when it was brought into Newquay Harbour and then again when it was sold at Plymouth Fish Market. Chris said: 'There was nothing that could have been done to rescue it. A shark needs oxygen to breath and it got wrapped up in the net which was too tight for it. 'If the shark was alive when it came up we would have freed it. As it was dead the shark was taken to the fish market to be sold.' Trapped: The predator had suffocated after getting caught in fishing nets . Sighting: A thresher shark was captured on camera as it leapt from Welsh coastal waters earlier this year . Sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills, meaning they have to keep moving to respire. Threshers use their long scythe-like tails, which can make up around half of their total length, to stun prey before they tear at the flesh. Thresher sharks are usually found . along the continental shelves of North America and Asia in the North . Pacific, but exist in all oceans of the world. They tend to stay in the open ocean, but do not venture below 500m, preferring to feed on schools of fish at shallower depths. The thresher shark has a torpedo-shaped body and small head and teeth. It is named after its long . scythe-like tail, which is used to stun prey before the shark goes in for the kill. The breed is considered a 'vulnerable' species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. The predator is the third of its kind to have been caught in Cornwall in the last few months. Angler Malcolm Roberts, 49, was fishing with friends off the coast of Looe when a 350-pound thresher tugged on his line. It took them an hour and a half to haul in the 13-foot shark. And in July a 20-foot thresher was caught off Falmouth by the trawler The John Boy, which was fishing for mackerel in the English Channel. One of the fish was also photographed recently as it jumped spectacularly out of the sea off the Welsh coast.","Crew were fishing for seabass off the coast of Padstow, Cornwall, when they netted the shark .

Standing in the midst of a group of reporters with his back against a wall at the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles, David Beckham suddenly seems struck by his longevity as a footballer. ‘It’s amazing isn’t it?’ he laughed. ‘Twenty years we’ve all been doing this. But I’m just thankful I’m still playing. ‘You guys are the same. You’re still reporting on games. You are probably thinking: “Oh sh*t, not again”. But this game never gets old for me. I never get tired of it.’ Still going strong: Beckham has made it clear that he wants to play on . At 37, Beckham still hasn’t changed much. From Manchester to Madrid to Los Angeles (with a pit stop in Milan), Beckham’s career has been more eclectic than anybody would have imagined, but it’s clear the fire has not yet gone out. He will play in the MLS Cup Final for LA Galaxy against Houston at lunchtime local time today - his final game for the club - and then  quickly turn his head to stare down the next challenge. Despite the aches and pains of an ageing athlete, retirement isn’t an option. Not yet. Events across the pond at Old Trafford in the first month of this year convinced him of that. ‘I saw what happened with Scholesy,’ he said, referring to Paul Scholes’s decision to reverse his retirement. ‘I plan to keep playing as long as I can because I know when Scholesy stepped away he came back and regretted stopping. Old friends: Beckham in his United days with Scholes (centre) and Giggs (left) ‘You know when it’s time and  obviously Scholesy realised it wasn’t his time at that moment and I’m the same. It’s not my time. It’s nice to see him and Giggsy still playing at Man U. They’ve had successful careers there and to see them  playing like they do now is great. We grew up together and, like them, I want to play as long as my legs will take me.’ Thursday was pretty much ‘Beckham day’ at Galaxy training. A conditioning session in the Californian drizzle at 10am and then media commitments ahead of his final game after six seasons in the States. After all this time, he remains the MLS’s biggest media draw. They will miss him. Beckham wasn’t due to speak to English journalists but, as usual, he found the extra time. Although his plans were off limits, he did admit that he harbours ambitions to play in the Champions League again. ‘I think that because I always loved it,’ he said. ‘I still miss playing in it; they are the games you love playing in. Centre of attention: Beckham took the time out to speak to English journalists . ‘We’ll see where I go next. If it’s a team that’s in the Champions League then it will be nice to be back. Wherever I’ve gone it’s been a big deal throughout my career. Whether it’s been going on loan to AC Milan or leaving Manchester United for Real Madrid or Real to here, it’s always been big news. This next move will be a move that is about the football. That has never been any different for me. ‘People say some of the moves have been about money but my answer is always the same, that my career has never been about money. I’m not money motivated, I just want to play for the best team and with the best players.’ It is remarkable to think it is almost a decade since Beckham left United. ‘I couldn’t have stayed, it wasn’t an option obviously,’ he said with a smile. Since that time, little has changed in England. United were top of the Premier League when he left and are top again ahead of this weekend’s games. ‘I’m not surprised by that, I don’t know why anybody is surprised by that,’ he said. Up for the cup: Beckham will line up alongside Robbie Keane (right) for LA Galaxy for the last time . ‘I’ve always said that money at football clubs is OK sometimes, but it doesn’t last forever. I think  Manchester United are a club about history. Other clubs might have the money and might be able to pay players more but when Man United come calling it’s impossible to turn them down. ‘You see a player like Robin van Persie has spent the years he has at Arsenal but when Man United come knocking it’s impossible to say no. It doesn’t matter what other clubs are interested and what money is being thrown around.’ Beckham will one day take up an  ambassadorial role at Old Trafford. ‘I’m sure that will happen in some way,’ he confirmed. For now, though, he is looking forward to owning one of the MLS  ‘development franchises’ (essentially one of the smaller, newer clubs) in the near future and keeping retirement at bay that little bit longer. Mum's the word: Beckham did not discuss his future . ‘I wouldn’t say I’m scared of retiring,’ he said. ‘But I know I will miss it when I finish playing, of course. Every player and every professional person who walks away from a job misses it. ‘I’d like to be an owner because I don’t want to be a manager.  Management has never interested me. I love playing and coaching but I would rather be an owner. In the MLS.’ Beckham is expected to spend Christmas in England. Indeed his wife Victoria and their four children have already left America for the UK. It won’t be long before his next move becomes clear. Meanwhile he will have time to watch his best friend Gary Neville’s TV career blossoming. ‘He’s always loved to talk so it doesn’t surprise me,’ he laughed. ‘Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just have to ignore him.’","Scholes retired too early, I won’t do that .

The original Batmobile is to go under the hammer for the first time, 47 years after its designer built it from an old Lincoln Futura - that he bought for $1. American car customiser George Barris transformed the banger into the sleek black vehicle that starred in the legendary film and TV series in 1966. Now the 87-year-old, who has owned it ever since, has decided to sell the caped crusader’s company car - which he today called the 'most valuable car in the world'. The 'most valuable car in the world': George Barris (pictured) has decided to sell the original Batmobile 47 years after he built it from an old Lincoln Futura . It will be auctioned off by Barrett Jackson on January 19 at its sale in Scottsdale, Arizona with both auction house and owner tight-lipped on the car’s reserve. However both parties expect the 19ft long piece of automotive history will sell for 'multiple millions'. The Batmobile started out as a 1955 Lincoln Futura which Barris bought from Ford in 1965 for a nominal $1. He then spent 15 days and $15,000 transforming the concept car into the one-of-a-kind Batmobile to be driven by actor Adam West. Appealing: The Batmobile (pictured with Adam West as Batman) uses a V8 engine and automatic gearbox. It's unmistakeable design and famous history will appeal to collectors . Making history: Adam West, in full Batman costume, drives the original Batmobile, which is really a 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car weighing nearly three tons . George said yesterday: 'I think it is . the most valuable car in the world and the public really get a kick out . of it when they see it. 'I . designed and built the Batmobile and I have shown it all around the . world but now I think it is time that someone else can enjoy it. 'Over . the years I have built many cars and I always get attached to them and . it will be sad to see it go but I would like someone else to enjoy it . now. 'When I created it I wanted to make it a star like Adam West and Burt Ward. It was not just a car.' The Batmobile uses a V8 engine and . automatic gearbox but it is its unmistakable design and famous history . which will appeal to collectors.

Dream team: Adam West, and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin in the Batmobile. Mr Barris spent 15 days and $15,000 transforming the concept car . Craig Jackson, chairman and CEO of Barrett-Jackson, said: 'The Batmobile is true Americana and it’s hard to put a dollar figure on something like that. 'The difference is that this is the real deal, the original and the only one to have been on the Batman series - it’s been in George Barris’ garage for all these years and that is invaluable. 'This vehicle not only marks the significant Bat logo that sits on the middle of its door, but a time in television history where they defied the odds of making a car the real star of the show. 'It revolutionised an entire industry that followed in its footsteps and we couldn’t be prouder to have it cross our block in Scottsdale as it goes up for sale for the very first time.

A Chinese baby is struggling to learn to walk and crawl because she has giant tumours on one side of her body, making her chest and her right arm swell. One-year-old Xinlei, of Mingxian County, in the Gansu Province of China, was born with an egg-sized tumour on her chest and doctors . diagnosed her as having congenital haemangioma and lipoma. Haemangiomas are actually types of birthmarks and are rarely more than a raised lump on the skin. One-year-old Chinese toddler Xinlai suffers from giant tumors on one side of her body, which make her chest on the right side and her right arm swell . And a lipoma is a soft, fatty lump that grows under the skin, and can occur on any area of skin where there are fat cells. It is harmless and can usually be left alone. But in little Xinlei's case, as she has grown older the tumours have spread over her right side, making it difficult for her to move and meaning she is in constant discomfort. Father Wang . Wei and his wife Wang Jinfang are now trying to raise 200,000 Yuan (£20,000) in surgery fees to help cure their daughter Xinlei. Her parents are now trying to raise money to treat the one year old for her unusual growth condition. It leaves her in almost constant discomfort .

Daddy's girl: The toddler's condition can almost be concealed in clothes, with just a slightly enlarged hand a tell-tale sign. But when her clothes are removed, the full extent of the growth of the tumours is clearly visible . Although a Communist country, China does not have a cradle-to-grave free-at-the-point of use healthcare system. Instead around half of the population buy basic medical insurance which covers for half the costs of their healthcare. The remainder is paid either by patients or their health insurer. However, this leaves the poorest in China struggling to meet medical bills for serious condition like Xinlei’s.","Xinlei, of Mingxian County, in the Gansu Province of China, was born with just an egg-sized tumour on her chest .

You may be forgiven for thinking that the only present passengers flying off from Heathrow this Christmas REALLY want is the reassurance that they’ll take-off on time, without huge queues, lost baggage or the risk of their flight being grounded by uncleared snow on the runway. But instead, millions of passengers at Britain and Europe’s busiest airport run the risk of being accosted by a ‘Secret Santa’ dishing out presents to take their minds off potential mishaps. A Heathrow spokeswoman said: ’Santa’s arrival marks the beginning of 24 days of unexpected surprises for the lucky 4.3million passengers travelling through Heathrow, making their journey even more memorable as they make their way through the airport for Christmas.’ Something to take your mind of it: Stressed passengers passing through Heathrow over the busy festive period could receive a treat from the airport's Secret Santa .

One month ago, the massively powerful winds, rain, and floodwaters of Superstorm Sandy devastated much of New York and New Jersey, killing 60 in the region and causing more than $62billion in damage. In the aftermath of the storm, relief groups offered their aid, but many have blasted the Red Cross for being absent in the areas hit hardest by the storm. Many have slammed the organization for not helping families who needed the most relief and are asking what the Red Cross has done with the $150million in donations it has received. Scroll down for video . Lamentable? A Superstorm Sandy volunteer has blasted the Red Cross for its response to Sandy, asking where the $150million in donations has gone . Help: Hundreds who were impacted by Sandy, wait in line for distributions from FEMA and Red Cross on November 19 in Coney Island; the activist said she only saw two Red Cross trucks in the Rockaways in two weeks . Nightmare: A still-running water pipe floods the foundation of a home destroyed by Sandy in Oakwood, Staten Island on November 28 . New York-based activist Michelle Manning wrote a piece detailing her experiences volunteering in Sandy’s wake, published by the Daily Beast. What she saw was astounding. She wrote that in the first two weeks following the storm, she saw Red Cross vehicles only twice, but had worked in the hard-hit Far Rockaways every day. Ms Manning said: ‘The first time there were two white vans. Dazzlingly white. (Most of the relief vehicles, including my own, were filthy and battered. 'This has been dirty work.) They weren’t at work. They weren’t handing out supplies. They were waiting for Governor Cuomo. For a photo-op.’ The other time, she said, was when President Obama was visiting the most devastated areas of Staten Island. Aftermath: American flags are displayed on flood-damaged homes in the hard-hit Breezy Point neighborhood of Queens on Wednesday . A month later: A group of people walk on the beach this morning past sections of boardwalk damaged by the storm surge of superstorm Sandy in Long Beach in Long Island . Erosion: Houses are surrounded by sand in Ortley Beach, New Jersey, almost a month after the area was hit by Hurricane Sandy . The activist wrote that in every case she has seen out in the field, the Red Cross was underprepared and not stocked with necessities. In one instance, she said, Red Cross workers asked volunteers for water to hand out ‘because they didn’t have any themselves - $150million should buy a few bottles of water.’ 'I went to a shelter Monday night after . the storm. People were coming in with no socks, with no shoes. They were . in desperate need. Their housing was destroyed. They were crying. Where . was the Red Cross?' -Staten Island president Jim Molinaro, speaking on November 1 . But Ms Manning hasn’t been the only one to notice the obvious absence of the relief organization. In a November 1 press conference, Staten Island Borough President Jim Molinaro called the organization an ‘absolute disgrace.’ He later described his logic: ‘I went to a shelter Monday night after the storm. People were coming in with no socks, with no shoes. They were in desperate need. Their housing was destroyed. They were crying. Where was the Red Cross? ‘Isn’t that their function? They collect millions of dollars. Whenever there’s a drive in Staten Island, we give openly and honestly. Where are they? Where are they?’ He encouraged residents of Staten Island not to donate to the non-profit, saying, ‘let them get their money elsewhere.’ However, Mr Molinaro spoke on CNN with Anderson Cooper a day later, saying that ‘things are looking up.' He said that more aid was coming, and had spoken with Gov. Cuomo and President Obama over receiving necessary assistance. Aftermath: An aerial photo from Halloween shows the wrecked amusement park on the Jersey Shore in Seaside Heights . Submerged: A photo from October 30 shows a parking lot full of yellow cabs in Hoboken, New Jersey; officials now estimate the storm caused more than $62billion in damages . Flooded: An MTA official shines a flashlight on standing water inside the South Ferry 1 train station in New York days after Sandy; the station is closed and authorities say it will cost $600m to restore . Anne Marie Borrego, a spokesperson for the Red Cross, told MailOnline that her organization was indeed on the ground in the days following Sandy. ‘There are some things in the [Daily Beast] piece that are inaccurate. We have been all over the Rockaways, there have been tons of press releases of where we would be, and we alerted local media.’She said that the Red Cross was not contacted for comment before the Beast’s story was published.‘We positioned supplies so we were ready to go in after the storm. We don’t put people or supplies in harm’s way, so once the storm passed; we were able to move supplies and individuals in. 'We had thousands of volunteers on the ground, we were spanning across all five boroughs.’ Ms Borrego said that the Red Cross has already spent $60-$70million of the donated funds for items like blankets and cleaning supplies, and said that they’ve served over 7.5million meals. Help: The Red Cross says they have served more than 7million meals and spent $50-$60million in relief efforts; Red Cross volunteer Ellen Foreman hands hot meals to Atlantic City residents on November 12 . The waiting game: Pictured November 14, people wait in line to receive free food from the American Red Cross in the heavily damaged Rockaway neighborhood in Queens . Assistance: Cleaning products, food and water are stacked at the Operation: Gut and Pump encampment in the Breezy Point on Wednesday, a month after the storm . She added: ‘For a consistent period of time, we’ve had 5,000 workers and volunteers on the ground.’ According to the organization’s website, the Red Cross responds to some 70,000 natural and man-made disasters each year across the United States. ‘People count on the Red Cross to help them in their darkest hour,’ the site reads. ‘In turn, the support of donors makes it possible for the Red Cross to fulfil its humanitarian mission.’ Among other things, the organization provides food and shelter in the wake of a disaster.The Red Cross was founded by Clara Barton in 1881. Sandy is being blamed for about $62 billion in damage and other losses in the U.S., the vast majority of it in New York and New Jersey — a number that could likely increase. It is the second-costliest storm in U.S. history after 2005's Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, which caused $128 billion in damage in inflation-adjusted dollars. Sandy damaged or destroyed homes and businesses, more than 72,000 in New Jersey alone, Gov. Chris Christie said yesterday. Photo op? Activist Michelle Manning said she only saw the Red Cross at key events, such as when President Obama, left, visited Staten Island on November 15 . Furious: Staten Island borough president James Molinaro blasted the Red Cross during a November 1 press release, calling the organization an 'absolute disgrace' New York is seeking $42 billion in federal aid, including about $9billion for projects to head off damage in future storms. Meanwhile, New Jersey is seeking nearly $37billion in aid, including $7.4billion for future projects. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg met with congressional leaders Wednesday to encourage quick action on storm aid. A month after the Superstorm, the true power and scope of Sandy has been calculated by the National Hurricane Center. The organization now says tropical force winds extended 820 miles at their widest, down from an earlier estimate of 1,000 miles. More work to do: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, right, held a press conference with U.S. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, left, at the U.S. Capitol to request more federal aid . All of the lights: Lasers have been installed on the rooftop of The Standard hotel on West 13th Street in Manhattan to commemorate the month anniversary of Sandy . Sandy's pure kinetic energy for storm surge and wave 'destruction potential' reached a 5.8 on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 0 to 6 scale, the highest measured. Governments are seeking money to help head off future disasters, as climate scientists continue to predict rising sea levels and the potential for more bad storms. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants electrical transformers in commercial buildings hauled to upper floors; the ability to shutter key tunnels, airports and subways; and to require hospitals to have backup power on high ground instead of on lower floors or in basements.

Kim Kardashian's divorce attorney told a judge Wednesday that the reality star wants to move on with her life but is 'handcuffed' to her estranged husband because the case is not yet ready for trial. Superior Court Judge Stephen Moloney told attorneys for Kardashian and NBA player Kris Humphries to return to court in mid-February to set a trial date to either dissolve or annul the couple's 72-day marriage. He didn't set a deadline for depositions and other pre-trial investigation to be completed, but indicated a trial could be held early next year if it is ready by Feb. 15. 'Handcuffed': Kim Kardashian's divorce lawyer says the reality star cannot move on with her life because her divorce case with estranged husband Kris Humphries is still not ready for trial, pictured on Tuesday in Florida . Humphries, a power forward for the Brooklyn Nets, is seeking an annulment based on fraud, but his attorney says he needs more time to collect documents from companies that handle Kardashian's reality shows. Kardashian is seeking a traditional divorce and her attorney Laura Wasser has cited both the marriage's short duration and a prenuptial agreement as reasons for why it should be quickly resolved. 'I don't think his client has a fraud case,' Wasser said in court of Humphries' attorney. 'I think there's a fishing expedition going on here.' Humphries' attorney Marshall Waller said he needed to be sure he had documents from E! Entertainment and NBC Universal before deciding the scope of his case, but that he was narrowing it down. 'I do understand the desire to get this case moved,' Waller said. 'There's nothing in particular about this case that makes it more important than anybody else.' Past and present: Kim with estranged husband Kris Humphries and, right, with current boyfriend Kanye West who has been deposed in the divorce case . Wasser however said that unlike in a regular divorce proceeding, Kardashian cannot have her marriage dissolved and resolve other issues later. 'Ms. Kardashian is now handcuffed to Mr. Humphries,' she said. Kardashian filed for divorce more than a year ago, citing irreconcilable differences just weeks after the couple's star-studded and televised wedding. Humphries later filed for an annulment, claiming the marriage was based on fraud but he has yet to lay out any specific evidence for his claim. Wasser says Kardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, and current boyfriend, Kanye West, have been deposed in the case. Kardashian, 32, has not yet been deposed in the case. She is the star of the E! Entertainment Television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the network's top-rated show, which averaged more than 3 million viewers in its sixth season. She also appears on other series involving her family.","Kardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, and current boyfriend, Kanye West, have been deposed in the divorce trial ."

Many people in India have not recognised the mop-haired Mayor at all, and some have mistaken him for tennis star Boris Becker and even the King of England. But chat show host Arnab Goswami – dubbed India’s answer to David Letterman claims millions of Indians do know Mr Johnson for his high wire antics during the London Olympics. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson has used a six-day trade visit to drum up publicity for London, playing cricket on Juhu beach with Mumbai school boys, taking part in a football game, meeting Bollywood film directors and appearing on one of India's biggest chat shows . Mr Johnson ended up dangling from a zipwire in London's Victoria Park in August when a publicity stunt at a public viewing area for the Olympic Games went awry leaving him stranded some 15 feet off the ground . ‘Our viewers certainly know who Boris Johnson is because of the Olympics and that memorable moment when he was dangling on a rope, which made headlines all over the place,’ Mr Goswani told reporters. ‘I think that Mr Johnson is an up-and-coming politician. Everyone in India saw the Olympics so they are interested in him personally. Many people in India believe that Boris Johnson is going to go on to greater things.’ But when the London Mayor appeared on his TV show, he played down talk of one day making a bid for Number 10. ‘I can assure that is about as likely as me being decapitated by a frizbee,’ he said. Mr Johnson also revealed how, when stuck on the zipwire while promoting the 2012 Games, he looked in vain to his special branch protection officer for help. ‘They gave me a security guard during the Olympics.

I spotted him the crowd and I said: “Carl, can you do something?” ‘Very slowly he reached in to his pocket and took out his mobile phone and took a photograph. That was his contribution to my predicament.’ Tough talk: London mayor Boris Johnson talks to India's equivalent of David Letterman, Arnab Goswami . Earlier Mr Johnson used a trip to the Bombay Stock Exchange to urge George Osborne to consider cutting the top rate of tax. The London Mayor compared the coalition’s 45 per cent tax rate for highest earners to the 30 per cent paid in India and said the Chancellor should ‘brood on’ whether Britain could be made more attractive for entrepreneurs . He has spent almost a week on the sub-continent wooing playing football, cricket riding a bicycle and joking about his Bollywood dancing. Labour said he should be focussing on jobs. Take the bull by the horns: London Mayor Boris Johnson poses with a bronze replica of a bull during his visit to the Bombay Stock Exchange . Making his point: Boris Johnson speaks during his visit at the Bombay Stock Exchange . The Mayor has insisted his trip is crucial to attracting more investment in London. Today he met Mumbai-based businessmen . who suggested the UK capital could lure more trade through lower rates . of tax and less regulation. Speaking at the Bombay Stock Exchange Mr Johnson claimed the tax regime ‘needed to be looked at’. He added: ‘You've got tax rates here . of only 30 per cent - a point George Osborne might like to brood on. It's 10 per cent for freelance income, and of course you have a market . of about 600 million people under 25.’ Skilful: London Mayor Boris Johnson shows off his sporting prowess by joining in a game of football with slum children in Mumbai . Sporting: The children were more interested in the sporting equipment on offer than the presence of either Mr Johnson, right, or England cricketer Kevin Pieterson . Charity: Mr Johnson, pictured playing with a cricket bat and ball, right, and with cricketer Kevin Pieterson (back right) and rugby legend Lawrence Dallaglio (back left) left, took time out from his six day tour of India to see the work of the Magic Bus project . He later told reporters: ‘One . businessman said to me this morning that he loved London, he loved the . quality of life in London. There are so many attractions of living in . London that you can't find anywhere else. That is a very high card. ‘But another businessman asked about . making London more attractive in terms of tax and regulation and . certainly the tax regime. As I have said many times before, that needs . to be looked at.’ Mr Johnson also posed with a bull statue at the exchanges' main entrance, gripping its horns as if he was a rodeo rider desperately clinging on. Goal: Boris Johnson plays football with Lawrence Dallaglio, centre, and Mumbai children . Charity: Boris visited the Magic Bus project, which uses sport to engage children on the edges of society in education and improving life skills . He has . attracted huge media attention during his visit, but faced claims from . the Labour party that he should have made trade trips during his first . term as London Mayor. A . Labour source said: ‘Boris should spend less time on Bollywood dancing, . cricket and football and more time meeting Indian business people. Taxpayers wanting getting jobs not on a glorified jolly.’ Mr Johnson might not be a seasoned sportsman - . despite being mistaken for Tennis legend Boris Becker during his trip . of India - but he was able to show off his . prowess on the football field yesterday as he joined in a game of . 23-a-side in the Mumbai slums. Never one to find himself on the . sidelines, the London Mayor donned a charity T shirt and played football . with children from the Magic Bus project, an enterprise ran by a . British charity. Until . now Mr Johnson had enjoyed the royal treatment on his six day tour of . the subcontinent and had been welcomed by everyone from Bollywood film . producers to state governors. Line-up: Boris Johnson, back centre, with Lawrence Dallaglio, back left, Kevin Pieterson and slum children from Mumbai . Helping: Kevin Pieterson, left, spent time with the Magic Bus children and watched as Boris Johnson gave the youngsters some coaching . But . the mayor took the afternoon off to meet some of the city's poorest . children when he visited Mumbai's port slum, where the average monthly . wage is just £25, untreated sewage flows through the streets and there . is no running water or electricity. Just . two years ago, the field where the children played was covered in . 'defecation and broken glass' according to one cameraman who had visited . and had to dodge puddles of sewage while the children ran in bare feet. Now . there was grass and the children - who would otherwise have been out . gathering rubbish from the dumps surrounding their homes so their . parents could sell the scraps - were able to play freely. Unconcerned . by the presence of Mr Johnson, England cricketer Kevin Pieterson or . Rugby World Cup winner Lawrence Dallaglio, the children rushed to grab . cricket equipment from the trio. Joining the youngsters for a game of . football afterwards, Mr Johnson said that the children had 'zap' after . being hit repeatedly as the group kicked footballs at each other. Indian . journalists asked the mayor about his favourite sports. Cricket, tick. Football, tick. But they had no idea about Eton’s Wall Game and Mr . Johnson quickly realised it was best not to try to explain. It was then time for a round of the hokey-cokey, with what appeared to be some Maori dance moves led by Dallaglio. By that stage, the mayor’s convoy was moving on. Back through the slum and to Mumbai’s five-star Taj Mahal hotel. VIDEO: Boris for England?

A trainee teacher who stole a rare 18th century violin worth £500,000 has been jailed after a police sting operation. The Guarnerius violin, made in 1735, was stolen from the home of classical musician David Roth, who had owned it for more than 40 years. John Powles, 24, who is training to be a teacher, was jailed for eight months after admitting the burglary. His accomplice Dean Barton, also 24, was sentenced to nine months in jail for the same charge, and a further three months for handling stolen goods. Convicted: Dean Barton (left)  was sentenced to nine months in jail for burglary and a further three months for handling stolen goods. John Powles (right) was jailed for eight months after also admitting to burglary . The duo admitted breaking into Mr Roth’s home in Cricklewood, north west London, on August 17. Harrow . Crown Court heard how Barton and Powles forced their way in while Mr . Roth was out and made off with the violin, along with two candlesticks, . some jewellery and a quantity of collectable foreign coins. But . they were caught just a few days later when they tried to sell the . violin to undercover police officers posing as would-be buyers. Chris . Carey, prosecuting, said: 'This is an unusual case. The men were under . surveillance by officers while trying to sell these goods.' The . court heard that four days after the violin was stolen another burglary . took place at an address in Kilburn in which several items were stolen . including two Apple Mac computers and a quantity of jewellery. The thieves also took the keys to a BMW and Lexus car. The BMW was then stolen from outside the house. Police probing the raids visited pawn and music shops in the local area. Rare: The Guarnerius violin, made in 1735, was stolen from the home of classical musician David Roth who had owned it for more than 40 years. On . the same day as the second burglary, a man visited a music store and . asked a member of staff to obtain a valuation for a violin - now . identified as Mr Roth’s. Staff at the shop obtained a mobile phone number from the man. Police made contact with the suspect via the mobile number and arrangements were made to meet at a hotel to buy the violin. Powles, of Haverstock Hill, Belsize Park, north London, and Barton, of Brassey Road, Kilburn, north west London, were arrested when they turned up. When police searched their homes a large amount of property was seized at Barton’s address and later identified as being stolen from the two burglaries. Mr Roth, who played in the Allegri String Quartet for 30 years and is now semi-retired, said he was left distraught when his cherished instrument was stolen, having bought it from the Bond Street violin-makers W. E. Hill & Sons in 1968. He added: 'It was a good one that was on the market at the time. The best I could afford I suppose, a fine Italian made violin. I was very upset when it was taken. We’ve got it back now.' Detective Chief Inspector Steve Burns, who led the investigation, said: 'Any theft is distressing, but experiencing loss following an intruder breaking into your home is particularly awful. 'Officers carried out an excellent fast time investigation demonstrating teamwork and professionalism that resulted in the arrest of two residential burglars and return the stolen property to their rightful owners. 'We will continue to track down those who commit burglary on this borough. 'We are also determined to raise people’s awareness of security and help stop burglary from happening in the first place. 'Burglary, on the whole, is an opportunist crime often resulting from insecure premises, residents can secure their homes by taking some simple crime prevention measures.' Chief Superintendant Matthew Gardner, Brent Police Borough Commander, said: 'This case evidences a superb piece of detective work which my officers deliver everyday. 'I am delighted that we were able to return precious belongings to the victim.' In a separate incident, a rare 18th century violin worth £140,000 has been stolen from its owner’s flat, police said. The instrument, a Nicola Gagliano dating back to 1747, is possibly one of only three in the world. Its 31-year-old owner returned to his home in Erlanger Road, New Cross, south east London, at 10.45pm last night to find that the main communal door had been forced open along with his own front door. Various rooms were searched and a number of items taken including the violin, which was in a brown rectangular case with two straps. Detectives in Lewisham are appealing for information about the incident.","Previous violin was taken in house raid along with foreign coin collection .

A wife-beater who stabbed his partner to death with a kitchen knife has been jailed for life. Ian Hope had repeatedly assaulted Sarah Gosling, 41, during their relationship but his final, deadly attack left her with no blood left in her body. The single stab wound, inflicted with a knife to her chest, severed an artery and led to rapid bleeding and then death. Sarah Gosling, 41, who was stabbed to death by her partner during a row at their home in February . When police asked what had happened, the 53-year-old said: 'She’s been on at me.' During a trial at Newcastle Crown Court the paramedic who attended to Miss Gosling said: 'She had no blood within her circulatory system. 'I gave her fluid through a vein and it went through her system and was just coming out of the wound as water.' The attack came just weeks after Hope split Miss Gosling’s head open with a rolling pin because she 'wouldn’t shut up'. During the trial Hope claimed the kitchen knife 'ended up in her' after she hit him with a bottle during a row as he used the weapon to prepare chicken for dinner. No remorse: Ian Hope, 53, pictured left, showed no remorse at murdering his partner Sarah Gosling, 41, right, with a knife at their home in Newcastl . But prosecutor John Elvedge QC told jurors: 'The prosecution say Sarah Gosling was the victim of a sustained attack in the course of which a number of blows were delivered by the defendant. 'At the time he stabbed her he intended to kill her or cause her serious injury.' After just an hour of deliberation, jurors found the former distribution worker guilty of murder.  Hope shook his head as the jury foreman announced the guilty verdict yesterday. Judge Paul Sloan QC said Hope must serve at least 17 years behind bars before he can even apply for parole. The judge told him: 'A row erupted into violence and I am satisfied, as on previous occasions, you were the aggressor. The judge told him: 'A row erupted into violence and I am satisfied, as on previous occasions, you were the aggressor. 'You . punched her at least twice to the face, causing her injury, causing a . black eye and a gaping laceration to the inside of her bottom lip from . her lip having been forced into her teeth by the blow. 'She defended herself and hit you back, striking you on the nose, causing it to bleed. 'Perhaps . because she had the temerity to fight back and bloody your nose, you . armed yourself quite deliberately with a kitchen knife and you set about . attacking Sarah Gosling with that knife. 'She . tried to defend herself, warding off knife blows with her hand and in . the process she sustained five wounds to the back of her left hand. 'Eventually . you drove the blade into her right upper chest. Sarah Gosling collapsed . and bled to death within a short space of time.' Neighbours complained of a disturbance: The scene on Tewkesbury Road, Newcastle, after Sarah Gosling was knifed to death by her partner. Police had attended hours before the attack but left after the couple reassured them . The judge said Miss Gosling’s death has had a 'devastating' effect on her family and added: 'Their loss is immeasurable, no sentence I can impose will ease their pain.' He added that the jury clearly saw through Hope’s 'fabricated account' of what happened that night between the couple, who had met on Facebook in 2009. The court heard that just over a week before the killing, Hope had been ordered to go on a domestic violence course after cutting her head open with a rolling pin in January. A month after that attack, on . February 25, Hope rang the emergency services to say he had stabbed the . supermarket worker after an argument at their home in Tewkesbury Road, . Lemington, Newcastle. The . police had been at the house an hour before after neighbours complained . of a disturbance, but left after assurances from the couple that . everything was fine. The court heard Ms Gosling, originally from Guernsey, had suffered ten black eyes in a year at the hands of Hope. Mr . Elvedge told jurors: 'It is a fact that the defendant unlawfully . assaulted her on a number of occasions, sometimes using weapons. 'For . example, on Jan 18 2012, when he hit her with a rolling pin while she . was in bed, causing a deep laceration which required hospital treatment . by staples.' The Law Courts on Newcastle upon Tyne's Quayside, where Hope was sentenced . The court heard Miss Gosling had taken photographs of her own injuries from March 2011 until a week before her death. Mr . Elvedge added: 'Those photos show she had sustained black eyes in a . number of occasions which, say the prosecution, were deliberately and . unlawfully inflicted by the defendant.' Jamie Hill QC, defending, said Hope has summoned help immediately after the incident and showed 'regret' straight away. Following Hope’s sentencing, DCI . Christina Barrett, Northumbria Police Senior Investigating Officer, . said: 'My thoughts have been with Sarah’s family throughout this . investigation, it has been a difficult ordeal and has had a devastating . impact on them. 'Hope has shown no remorse whatsoever and has never admitted his actions, continually denying he had murdered Sarah.' Following the guilty verdict and sentence, Miss Gosling’s brother, Andrew Bernard said: 'Sarah Gosling was a mother, daughter and sister when she was robbed of her young life by Ian Hope. 'Before she met Hope she was an important part of a family with a husband, son and daughter. She had a stable life. 'Sarah’s death was completely unexpected to her mother, Jean. She remains to this day, nine months on, in denial, in shock and in mourning. 'She told me this week that she was ""heartbroken"" by Sarah’s death. It is of small comfort that our father David passed away quickly in 2003, for there is no doubt that as an ex-policeman, witnessing this would have crushed him. 'Being in court in the past two weeks has been the most harrowing and horrific time of my life. 'I thought I’d be able to cope with hearing the evidence, that my disgust in Ian Hope would somehow carry me through hearing about the circumstances of Sarah’s life in the North East and of her death at his hands. 'Nothing could have prepared me or Val, my wife, for hearing of the systematic and brutal way he controlled Sarah, their jealous fights, his continued goading of her using Facebook, their alcohol abuse and the violence he meted out ""to shut her up"". 'The verdict of murder is justice for Ian Hope. 'The pain that his killing of my sister has left us with will remain always. 'It is not lost on us the irony of the name ""Hope"" and this name will be a sickening reminder of what he has stolen from Sarah, her future, her children, and her wider family and friends.'","Ian Hope, 53, knifed Sarah Gosling, 41, in her chest, severing artery .

Nazi training: Fidel Castro, pictured in 2004, allegedly hired ex-SS officers to train his troops during the Cold War . Fidel Castro recruited former members of the Nazi SS to train Cuban troops during the Cold War, newly released German secret service files have revealed. The then Communist President of Cuba also bought Belgian-fabricated arms from two middle-men who had strong links to the extreme German right. It sheds light on the extent Castro, who in public was stringently committed to socialism, was willing to go in order to further his grip on the island nation and prevent an invasion from the U.S. Bodo Hechelhammer, historical investigations director at German foreign intelligence agency Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) said: 'Evidently, the Cuban revolutionary army did not fear contagion from personal links to Nazism, so long as it served its objectives.' The documents, released by the BND and published online by German newspaper Die Welt, show a series of plans developed in October 1962 - at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis. They reveal that two of the four former SS officers invited to La Havana had taken up the offer - and that they would receive 'substantial wages' of more than four times the average German salary at that time. And regarding the purchase of right-wing linked arms, they show how Castro had dealt with two traffickers - Otto Ernst Remer and Ernst Wilhelm Springer - in buying 4,000 pistols. The conclusion drawn by German secret . service officials was that the Cuban regime wanted to lessen its . dependence on buying Soviet-produced arms. Right-wing weapons: Fidel Castro, seen here giving a speech in Cuba in October 1962, also bought 4,000 pistols from men with links to the German extreme-right . October . 1962 was the month that the U.S. and the USSR came close to going to . war over Russian missiles stationed on the Caribbean island. The 13-day confrontation, between October 16 and 28, ended when a secret deal was reached between U.S. President John F Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. Publicly, the Soviets agreed to dismantle the weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification. In turn, the U.S. agreed to declare that it would never invade Cuba. Secretly, the U.S. also agreed it would dismantle all U.S.-built Jupiter IRBMs deployed in Turkey and Italy. This comes as thousands of documents authored by Robert F Kennedy during the years 1961-1964 were made public, including plans to assassinate Fidel Castro. Training for war: Fidel Castro, center, speaks with ally Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, right, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in 1960 as the Cold War gripped the world . During these years Robert F. Kennedy was the closest advisor to his brother John  and the 2,700 pages offers an insight into U.S. government’s decision-making during the Cold War. One CIA document offers a profile of Castro: It calls him intelligent but 'not very stable' and 'touchy, impatient and rash,’ whilst another one outlines a 1964 plan to assassinate the Cuban leader using ‘the mafia’. The mob and 'patriotic Cuban exiles' eventually settled on a payment of $100,000 for assassinating Castro, $20,000 for his brother Raul and $20,000 for revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara, plus $2,500 for expenses. Another prominent thread throughout the documents is the 13-day missile stand-off. On one white page from a meeting on Oct. 16, 1962, the first day of the crisis, Kennedy wrote out two columns: proponents of a blockade against Cuba and supporters of a military strike.","Two former SS officers trained Cuban troops during the Cold War .

And now NBC chiefs are keen to find Matt Lauer a new 'bromance' on the ailing breakfast show in a desperate bid to increase ratings. They want to hark back to the chemistry Lauer, 54, found with Gumbel, 64, who left the show after 15 years as co-host in January 1997. Ahead of the arrival of Today's new executives Alexandra Wallace and Don Nash next week, a source told MailOnline: 'If you look at Josh Elliott and Sam Champion on Good Morning America, they are really great friends and that shines through on air - not since Matt and Bryant have we seen chemistry like this on morning TV.' Frosty: Matt Lauer and his wife Annette at the UNICEF Snowflake Ball at Cipriani 42nd Street in Manhattan on Tuesday night . There is no love lost between Lauer and Today's other senior male presenter Al Roker - who is close friends . with Ann Curry. Ann, 56, was unceremoniously axed in June after just a year as Today's co-host, a move that has been blamed on Lauer, who last night made a rare public appearance with his wife Annette at UNICEF's Snowflake Ball in Manhattan. A senior TV source denied recent rumours that Lauer - who is on a staggering $25 million-a-year-deal - would be axed after Good Morning America took over Today's top spot in the ratings. The source, close to the Today show, said: 'Matt is on a huge deal, he's hugely important to NBC - he's not going anywhere.' Another source added: 'There is no chance in hell that Matt's getting fired. 'Of course, there are huge issues at Today and the big problem will be when the affiliates who pay all the money to air Today start complaining about ratings - they're never afraid to call a spade a spade. 'Every ratings point is worth millions in advertising revenue and Today knows it's not going to win its spot back overnight. 'We're waiting to see if Don Nash can do something bold. The consensus in the corridors at NBC is that Today desperately needs the right team. 'They need chemistry and the anchors need people to play with. 'Viewers like to see the presenters connecting, it's all about connectibility and there's no-one for Matt to banter with.' Best friends: Matt Lauer and former Today co-host Bryant Gumbel . Veteran: Bryant Gumbel and his wife Hilary Quinlan joined Matt and Annette Lauer at the Snowflake Ball on Tuesday night . 'And when push comes to shove, viewers know nothing about Matt. Savannah Guthrie is super smart, but again, viewers know nothing about her. 'On GMA, people know that Sam's getting married, Josh talks all the time about his daughter, they're going through Robin Roberts' illness with her and Lara just doesn't stop talking! 'In effect, Today needs to find its 'secret sauce'. NBC chiefs are already trying out new talent on air. Willie Geist has been moved to the 9am slot and is proving popular as a stand-in for Lauer, while other presenters are being trialled. Viewership for Good Morning America is . up three per cent so far this season, according to Nielsen ratings. Today is down . about 15 per cent. GMA has been averaging around 5.5 million viewers a show, while Today is averaging 5.3 million. Chemistry: GMA's Josh Elliott and Sam Champion on air together last week . Earlier this month, NBC announced Today's long-time executive producer Jim Bell - a good friend of Lauer - was being replaced by veteran news executives to take over the troubled morning programme. Nash, 47, a 23-year veteran of the show, is taking over as executive producer, and will be responsible for all four hours of Today. He starts on Tuesday, and will report to Alexandra Wallace, who was promoted to the newly created role of executive in charge of the Today show. Wallace, 47, will continue as executive producer of NBC's prime time news programme, Rock Center with Brian Williams, which is also struggling and faces the axe, according to TV insiders. What's up Al: Today stars Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer share a joke with Scarlett Johansson this week - but Al Roker doesn't look so happy . Bryant Gumbel, who co-hosted Today alongside Katie Couric, acknowledged that he is 'best friends' with Lauer as he spoke out following Ann Curry's departure. He spoke out in Lauer's defence as he told the LA Times: 'I’m surprised and disappointed at this idea that Ann was a martyr, that she was thrown under the bus. 'I don’t know why she’s being portrayed as a modern-day Joan of Arc. In every job, in every walk of life, people are hired to do a job, and if they don't do it well they are relieved of that job.' The outspoken star added: 'It’s a big-boy business, and when things don’t work out, people are asked to leave. It’s happened to me; it’s happened to almost everyone in this business,; . Gumbel said he doesn’t watch Today, in keeping with a practice he began during his own run between 1982 and 1997, adding: 'I’m not a TV watcher and I’m not a morning-show watcher.' As for Savannah Guthrie, Gumbel added: 'Matt tells me she’s a good person, and I believe him.'","TV execs want to rival the chemistry ABC rival Good Morning America has found between Josh Elliott and Sam Champion .

Though panning for gold might seem like an outdated activity better suited for the rough-and-tumble prospectors of the 19th century, that hasn’t stopped hundreds of people from sifting through gravel and silt, in hopes of striking gold. But in Colorado, residents who have been prospecting through the state’s rivers and creeks for gold dust could be in for an unfavorable change. Lawmakers are considering a ban on harvesting of the precious mineral. Forbidden: Colorado lawmakers are considering a ban on harvesting of gold on city land along with other minerals . Hard day's work: Hours of scooping and sifting often yiled no more than $20 worth of gold dust . Gold panning has experienced a spike in popularity in part because of shows like ‘Gold Rush’ on the Discovery Channel, which depicts people finding fortune within river basins and streams. Officials in Larimer County, Colorado, will vote on banning the retrieval of minerals from city land next month, though recreational prospectors said the motion is unnecessary. ‘There are other issues that the county commissioners, I feel, should be devoting their efforts to,’ Darrell Koleber told 9News. He added that there is little to no gold left in the region. Despite the lack of the precious mineral, many recreational prospectors still sift through mud and sediment – not as a means to gain wealth, but as a pastime.

The can of worms for us is the mineral rights,’ he told the paper. The environmental factor, he said, was negligible. If commissioners do sign off on the rule change, gold hunting in Larimer County would be banned on any land owned by the Department of Natural Resources. Trend: In 2011, gold prices climbed from $1,388 per ounce to well over $1,700, leveling off by the end of the year at $1,500 . Last year, gold prices climbed from $1,388 per ounce to well over $1,700, leveling off by the end of the year at $1,500.

They were the undisputed literary hits of the summer breaking all sorts of records as copies flew off the shelves at unimaginable speed. But rather than enjoying racy scenes featuring Anastasia and Christian Grey, a quarterly magazine has taken a more analytical approach to reading EL James' 'Fifty Shades of Grey' trilogy. Journalists at Delayed Gratification trawled through all three books - Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Free - to find out just how much of the novels was about sex and to highlight the kinkiest moments. Each successive novel was found to feature less sex than its predecessor but the later books did score higher on the kinkiness scale. Readers reached the sexiest scenes earlier in the second and third books after having to trawl through 80 pages of Fifty Shades of Grey to reach the saucy stuff. The statistics show that the first book in the trilogy, Fifty Shades of Grey, was made up of 13 per cent sex, that's 71 out of 528 pages. The kinkiest highlights for readers, according to the statistics, included Grey's 'red room of pain' and the employment of leather handcuffs, eye masks and a flagellation device. The second book, Fifty Shades Darker, features less sex, making up 11 per cent of the book or 62 pages out of 544. Readers found scenes where a silk tie and massage oil were used as among the most titillating. Finally, the trilogy's last outing, Fifty Shades Freed, featured the least sex with eight per cent or 50 pages of 592. Among the hottest highlights was a sadomasochistic scene featuring flagellation. Sexy stats: Delayed Gratification magazine produced statistics charting all the action in EL James' trilogy . Delayed Gratification editor Rob Orchard told The Economist: 'The idea to pull together the data came from that old story about copies of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" falling open on the ""interesting"" bits, which made us think we should provide a user's guide to the ""Fifty Shades"" books. 'We were spurred on by the secret code we kept hearing between people reading the books on the train–""Have you reached page 348 yet?""'

When Paula Broadwell wrote the biography of her lover David Petraeus, she managed to keep out any hint of their relationship from the book. But when Saturday Night Live took on the notorious relationship during the opening sketch of last night's show, they reimagined it as a significantly more steamy tome similar to bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey. The irreverent comedy showcase featured comic Cecily Strong portraying Broadwell giving a reading of her biography of the former director of the CIA, with a surreal erotic twist. Scroll down for video . Mocking: Cecily Strong played Paula Broadwell in a sketch on Saturday Night Live . Parody: 'Broadwell' read from a pornographic rendition of her biography of David Petraeus . The fictional Broadwell was holding a genuine copy of All In, the fawning biography of Petraeus published earlier this year, as she read in front of a crowd of stuffy politicoes. But she immediately launched into a filthy rendition of her extra-marital liaison with the general, supposedly started when she was shadowing him during his time as head of the western forces in Afghanistan. The extracts began with sincere comments about military matters such as the troop surge and counter-insurgency efforts. However, they then descended into aggressively explicit descriptions of her relationship with Petraeus, as she described her telling him, 'You are a dirty girl, Paula. You're my dirty girl.' Strong also praised a group of soldiers who 'barely seemed to notice as General Petraeus and I went at it like a pair of rutting baboons behind a Jeep barely 50 yards away.' Obviously disgusted by the surreal reading, the sketch showed nearly all of the audience walking out - leaving just Fred Armisen remaining, with a creepy grin on his face. Fan: Fred Armisen played a creepy audience member who was disturbingly titillated by the performance . Returning to the well: Jason Sudeikis played Wolf Blitzer in a sketch mocking Florida socialite Jill Kelley . The show then turned its comedic guns on Jill Kelley, the Florida socialite who inadvertently exposed the scandal when she reported threatening emails she had received from Broadwell to the FBI. Strong read an invented extract from the book describing her and Petraeus spying on Kelley using a military drone. She said that the general asked, 'Would you like to be with a woman like that? 'You know, she has a twin sister.' As the sketch became increasingly more explicit, it faded out after Strong began another extract saying: 'Like most people, I have always had mixed feelings about erotic aspyxiation.' Seth Myers tossed out a series of witty one-liners about the scandal during the 'Weekend Update' segment of the show, describing it as 'a sexy new reboot of You've Got Mail'. He joked that one of the big winners from the story would be 'whoever writes the next biography of Petraeus', as he would be able to include details of the scandal itself, adding: 'Reading the Broadwell biography is like reading a biography of Batman before his parents died.' Star: Guest host Jeremy Renner played 'Fat Douche Derek', the 'self-proclaimed mayor of Tampa' Joke: Tim Armstrong took part in a fake dramatisation of video footage featuring Kelley . Myers pointed out that Petraeus' downfall was an ominous warning for 'people trying to have affairs in the digital age', saying: 'You can't get away with it - even the director of the CIA couldn't get away with it.' And he mocked Kelley's involvement as he said her description as a 'Tampa socialite' sounded like 'a 1920s euphemism for prostitute' and quipped: 'Sex scandals are like Jewish New Yorkers, eventually they all make their way to Florida.' Unsurprisingly, SNL returned to the week's biggest news story later in the show, with Jason Sudeikis playing CNN's Wolf Blitzer in a sketch mocking the media's coverage of the case. He introduces Kelley - also played by Strong - walking out of her house, then shows the video again, commenting that she is 'seen here in the same clip doing the same thing because it's the only footage we have of her'. The seconds-long clip was played several times, then replaced with a deliberately shoddy 'dramatisation' of the clip with Kelley played by Tim Armstrong. Sudeikis also conducted an interview with 'Fat Douche Derek', the 'self-proclaimed Mayor of Tampa', played by guest host Jeremy Renner, who when asked about Kelley would only say, 'She fine,' and replied to a question about Petraeus and General John Allen by saying, 'Who they?' Allen was roped in to the controversy when it exchanged that he and Kelley had apparently exhanged thousands of emails after becoming acquainted while he was serving at Central Command in Afghanistan.","Author, played by Cecily Strong, recites filthy biography of her lover .

After weeks on the run from authorities in Belize, has multi millionaire software developer John McAfee, 67, finally been captured? A posting on the anti-computer-virus pioneer's own blog suggests that indeed he has - which if it proves to be true will end an increasingly bizarre saga that has lasted almost a month. Wanted by police in the Central American country for questioning regarding his neighbour's murder, whoismcafee.com was updated on Saturday afternoon with an 'unconfirmed report that John McAfee has been captured at the border of Belize and Mexico.' Scroll Down for Video . Multi-millionaire software developer John McAfee appeared on CNN for an interview on Friday and his blog was updated claiming 'unconfirmed reports' he had been arrest on Saturday . McAfee has frequently used the blog to keep the world updated on his weird and wonderful attempts to evade captured in Belize, which have included dressing in outlandish disguises and swapping cell phones over to avoid satellite detection. He has in the past claimed that there exists enough material to keep the blog going for a year and has also stated that should anything happen to him a man named Chad would be put in charge of posting information - and it seems that day has come. In Belize, a source at the U.S. Embassy speaking anonymously to reporters said that friends of McAfee denied he had been captured and that they and the police had no information on a possible arrest. If the outlaw software developer has been apprehended it comes directly after an interview with CNN, in which he claimed his life was in danger and that he had tired of life on the run, which he has been since his neighbour, Gregory Faull, was discovered with a bullet in his head on November 11th. Anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee at The San Pedro Sun in May of this year for an interview . In the brief talk with a CNN reporter, McAfee said, 'I will certainly not turn myself in, and I will certainly not quit fighting. I will not stop my blog.' Claiming that he will either be arrested or get away, clarifying 'Get away doesn't mean leave the country. It means they will, No.1, find the murderer of Mr. Faull and, No.2, the people of this country - who are by and large terrified to speak out - start speaking out.' McAfee and Faull repeatedly had run-ins with each other the dogs that the multi-millionaire owned and in one interview with Wired claimed that the killers of Mr. Faull were looking for him in fact and not his unfortunate neighbour. In fact, the last six months have proven to be one odd episode after another for McAfee, which began in May when his home was raided and police said they found multiple firearms and the 67-year-old living with a 17-year-old girl. The CNN report also noted that police in Belize have said they don't consider . McAfee a suspect in the killing; they say they only want him for questioning. And yesterday, the ecentric fugitive millionaire . software mogul, dropped the f-bomb on . live television Friday while explaining his dislike for local . politicians. ‘I . do not donate to any political party. When I was asked to donate, I . said, “Get the f*** off my property,”’ McAfee, 67, said during a . telephone interview with CNBC from ‘an undisclosed location.’ On the run: John McAfee, seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor, claims he is being set up by the Belizean government . He then apologized to the cable network for his verbal slip-up, one of many recent gaffes. McAfee was in the midst . of recounting an incident earlier this month in which 42 armed Belizean . officers allegedly stormed his compound, arrested him and detained him . for 14 hours with no food or water, and then let him go without charges. When . CNBC reporter, Robert Frank, asked McAfee why he thought the police had . done that, he said it was because he ‘does not play by the rules.’ McAfee . said that he has donated millions of dollars to the local economy, . including police departments and homeless agencies, but not through the . Belizean government itself. ‘I . don’t do it by giving to the government and letting them dole it out . because if I give $5 million to the government, $10,000 goes to the . people and $4 million plus change goes into the pockets of the . politicians,’ he said. ‘I give directly to the people. And I have been . doing this all along.’ McAfee, . founder of the anti-virus software company that bears his last name, . said he has been hiding out in the jungles if Belize and wearing . disguises in public when he needs to purchase supplies. He would not say what the disguises look like because he has ‘a feeling’ he will be wearing them again soon, he said. John McAfee has been a follower of alternative therapies and philosophies all his life and taught yoga after he sold his business . The . fugitive software mogul has been on the run from local police since . November 11, the day after his American neighbour, Greg Faull, a . 52-year-old contractor from Florida, was found shot in the head. Two . days before Faull's body was discovered, four of McAfee's dogs were . poisoned to death, making McAfee a 'person of interest,' Belize . authorities have said. McAfee . says he is innocent and that he will not turn himself in. He has said . on several occasions that he will be killed if he is taken into custody. He has also said the he was set up by the Belizean government and that . it all goes back to a bribe he didn't pay to a politician. But he is certainly not shying away from reporters while hiding out. Over the past three weeks . he has given multiple media appearances, including two interviews with . CNBC, an interview with The Daily Telegraph, an interview with ABC News, . and an interview with Wired Magazine. He also set up a blog, . where he details his jungle adventures, his ongoing claims of . government corruption, his thoughts about the highly addictive drug bath . salts, and his own personal investigation into Faull’s murder. A . few days after the news of his hiding made headlines, McAfee logged . onto the Internet to seek technical support on how phone tracking works, . Gizmodo reported. Not surprisingly, skeptics are disputing the validity of McAfee’s claims. The . fugitive software mogul told CNBC Friday that he is beginning to run . out of money and is having trouble getting cash from his bank in Belize. ‘My life has been up and down from a comfort standpoint,’ he told CNBC.

McAfee said he has no plans to leave the .

Though he could have turned a larger profit by selling to a chain, the store-owner said it wouldn’t be right not to share his wealth with those who had helped him the most. 'My employees are largely responsible for any success I've had, and they deserve to get some of the benefits of that,' he told the paper. 'You can't always take. You also have to give back.' Beloved: Mr Lueken is a beacon in the community of Bemidji, Minnesota, offering aid to anyone he can . Great boss: An employee chats with Mr Lueken, who has owned the grocery stores for 45 years . He said that his parents, who grew up in the Great Depression, taught him a motto that has shaped his life philosophy: 'Do the right thing.' Mr Lueken owns two supermarkets in . Bemidji and another in Wahpeton, North Dakota. He will begin . transferring ownership of his three stores beginning January 1. His workers will receive possession of the stores through an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), based on their salary and length of service. The ESOP allows the store's employees to form a trust and contribute to it, letting profits go back into the community. Publix Supermarkets is another U.S. grocery store that operates under this model. The idea was planted when Mr Lueken realized his four sons had no interest in taking over the family business. His adult children live and work on the East and West Coasts, and agreed that giving back to the community was the best option. Benefits: Workers will receive possession of the stores through an employee stock ownership plan based on their salary and the length of time they have worked there . Family business: Lueken first worked at the store in 1966 and later bought it from his brother . Community store: One of the three Lueken's Village Food stores in Bemidji, Minnesota . Mr Lueken also suffers from Parkinson’s Disease and was diagnosed in the 1990s. When he was about to undergo surgery, he realized his physician had been the recipient of one of his scholarships. That, he told ABC News, put him more at ease for his operation. The real-life story of Mr Lueken’s generosity echoes a Hollywood holiday classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life,' by famed director Frank Capra. The movie depicts James Stewart as Good Samaritan George Bailey, who sacrifices his dreams of traveling the world to ensure the dreams of others are realized. In one poignant scene, George and his new wife Mary give the money they had saved for their honeymoon to a local bank after there was a run on the money. Reminiscent: The story echoes the Hollywood holiday classic, It's A Wonderful Life, where James Stewart (pictured center) plays as Good Samaritan George Bailey . While it ensured the bank's future, it meant that the Baileys would not be taking a honeymoon. But Mr Lueken's act of kindness will allow for peregrination. With only a month left at the helm of his stores, Mr Lueken is planning to travel the world with his wife, Janice, and visit his grandchildren. The son of a baker, Mr Lueken spent his childhood greasing pans for his father. According to the Bemidji Pioneer, he was paid 26 cents a week. He worked at his first Lueken's store in 1966. At the time, the grocery store was owned by his brother, but Mr Lueken later bought it from him.","Joe Lueken, owner of Lueken's Village Foods, will transfer ownership to his employees on January 1 .

The girls were left orphaned when their family, including father Saad Al-Hilli (pictured) were gunned down. Now friends and family say they are struggling to see and get information about the sisters . The two young survivors of the French Alps massacre have been ‘kidnapped by social services’, it was claimed yesterday. Zainab al-Hilli, seven, and her sister Zeena, four, were orphaned when their parents were gunned down in their BMW on a holiday to Lake Annecy on September 5. Their father Saad al-Hilli, 50, mother Ikbal, 47, and grandmother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were killed alongside 45-year-old French cyclist Sylvain Mollier. The murders have baffled police both in France and Britain, where the Al-Hillis had a £1million home in Surrey. Relatives claim they want to care for the girls but they have been placed in foster care by Surrey County Council ‘against their will’. Their great-uncle, Ahmed al-Saffar, said Zainab and Zeena  had been upset when parting from their aunt Fadwa al-Saffar, their mother’s sister, after a brief recent visit. He was also at the meeting. He said: ‘They were crying, asking “why are our meetings so short? We want to be with you forever”. We were devastated by it.’ Mr al-Saffar, a Swedish-based pharmacologist in his sixties, fears the council’s approach to the girls’ welfare has compounded the tragedy they are striving to cope with. He said: ‘They would like to be with their family. We see their suffering after the pain and loss of their parents and how this then continues in their separation from the one they love to be with, which is their auntie.’ He said he had no criticism of the girls’ white British foster family, describing them as ‘kind and supportive’. ‘But the situation is not satisfactory and it is getting more difficult. He said the family wanted ‘answers to questions about the girls’ future’ but there had been no response to emails and inquiries. Murder scene: Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and his mother-in-law were all killed in an isolated lay-by near Lake Annecy . Zainab was shot in the shoulder and suffered serious head injuries in an apparent ‘pistol whipping’ during the attack in France. Zeena was found unharmed but . terrorised hours after the shooting. She had hidden beneath her mother’s . body in the rear seat well of the family car. Another friend of the family told the Sunday Times that the girls had effectively been ‘kidnapped by social services’. They have formed a private Facebook support group for the sisters, and the friends have said they are ready to adopt the girls. They say they want to offer them some sense of normality as they come to terms with the tragedy. One friend of the family said he has complained about the situation to his Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith, after becoming frustrated at a lack of response from social services to his attempts to pass messages and gifts to the sisters, the Sunday Times reported. Court orders obtained by Surrey county council protect the girls from publicity and  ban publication of any details that might disclose their whereabouts. Prayers: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, was laid to rest in the same grave . Detectives have not made a single arrest since the horror in the mountains and remain baffled as to who was responsible. A British cyclist and former RAF officer  was the first to arrive at the murder scene. He found the three adults dead in the car and a dazed and badly injured Zainab wandering nearby. Zeena was not discovered by police for another eight hours, hiding in the car. Detectives have combed Mr al-Hilli’s finances, investigated his links to Iraq and examined claims of a family feud in their attempts to track down the killer. The prosecutor leading the French police investigation, Eric Maillaud, has said that ‘all lines of inquiry remain open’. He is sending a formal request for judicial assistance to Baghdad about the family’s background and whether there was anything in their past that may have made Mr al-Hilli a murder target. Surrey County Council declined to comment. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Survivors of gun slaying in French Alps want to live with aunt .

A toddler has died in a farming tragedy after being hit by a pick-up truck on his mother's birthday. The boy, who was nearly two-years-old, died after being hit by a silver Nissan 4x4 at the farm near Fersfield in countryside between Diss and Kenninghall in Norfolk at around 4pm yesterday. Paramedics battled to save the child’s life but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Tragedy: The boy was hit by a Nissan 4X4 at around 4pm yesterday on private land between Diss and Kenninghall . The man driving the truck was in his 60s and is believed to be a close friend of the family who had worked on the estate for years. Detective Inspector Andy Coller said the death appeared to be 'a tragic accident'. He said: 'Our investigations are continuing with officers working closely with the Health and Safety Executive, however, at this time all indications are that this appears to have been a tragic accident. 'We have a specialist officer lending support to the family at this very difficult time and this will continue.' The farm worker was due to retire after Christmas, it is understood. A close family friend of the toddler's grandmother said the village has been completely 'rocked' by the tragedy. The friend, who asked not to be named, said: 'We found out yesterday and the village is completely in shock. It is a terrible farming accident that the family will have to live with forever. 'It was one of the old chaps who has worked on their family farm for years - he was due to retire at Christmas. I can't imagine what he's going through. It's just a tragic, tragic accident.

Heartbreak: The boy, aged nearly two, is understood to have died on the day of his mother's birthday . 'I found out last night before choir practice and just couldn't believe it. The village is totally rocked and devastated by the news. 'We were all practising Christmas carols and made the decision not to practise 'Away in a Manger'. 'It would have been too heartbreaking. The family had so much to look forward too, especially with Christmas coming up, I don't know how they'll cope. 'It was the boy's mum's birthday yesterday too, just devastating it's all happened at once.'

The model said that even though giving birth was ‘fulfilling’, she enjoyed it less because she was unable to smoke the entire time. In an interview the wife of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy also said that she found breastfeeding ‘absolutely sensual’ and revealed that ‘intimacy’ is what keeps her love alive. Cravings: Carla Bruni admitted that pregnancy would have been more enjoyable if she had been allowed to smoke . Miss Bruni, 44, gave birth to daughter Giulia in November last year when Mr Sarkozy, 57, was still in office. The two met at a dinner party in 2007 and got married the following year. It was her first time down the aisle, his third. Speaking to Vogue, Miss Bruni suggested she appears to have resisted her urge to smoke whilst pregnant, not least because of the health concerns. She said: ‘Pregnancy, giving birth... there are women who like it. She also said she found breastfeeding 'sensual' and revealed that 'intimacy' is what keeps her love alive . A good relationship: Carla Bruni said that Nicolas Sarkozy has been faithful to her as she has to him . ‘It is certainly fulfilling - but... In the eighth month, I wanted to go on a trampoline, smoke cigarettes.’ In the interview Miss Bruni said her verdict on giving birth was that it was a ‘sort of fabulous miracle’. She said: ‘It’s always astounded me to have succeeded at having kids. It’s crazy! ‘Perhaps the little girl inside me did not ever imagine being able to incarnate that reality’. Up close and personal: Carla Bruni revealed everything in an interview with Vogue . Prior to meeting Mr Sarkozy, Miss Bruni had been linked with a string of men including Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton. But despite being sought after she was grateful to be married because it ‘put an end to solitude’, she said. Miss Bruni said: ‘Before, I only knew solitude. I liked it... When I married the president of the republic I was stupefied by the way people judged me. It would never occur to me to judge anyone. I only judge people in one way. I like them or I don’t. But I don’t have preconceived ideas.’ They key to a good relationship, according to Miss Bruni, is ‘intimacy’ which she describes as ‘the geographical sharing of the physical life’ even if it is just sleeping or eating together. She also believes that Mr Sarkozy has been faithful to her, as she has to him, even though he is not the love of her life. She said: ‘I would not say he is the man of my life, I don’t like the expression — at this moment my father is also the man of my life, or my brother — but in any case he is the man I married.’ In an extract of the interview already published Miss Bruni said that a woman’ s place is in the home and that ‘we don’t need to be feminist in my generation’. Following outrage from women’s rights groups she apologised and said the remark was ‘very clumsy’.","The model gave birth to daughter Giulia in November last year .

Flying the flag: Gordon Brown with the Jolly Roger from Second World War submarine HMS Tantalus which has resurfaced after 40 years missing . A Jolly Roger flag flown atop a World War Two submarine has resurfaced - after going missing for 40 years. The flag was last flown on HMS Tantalus at the end of the war in 1945 and was given to the boat's youngest submariner, telegraphist Jack Brown, at the end of its service. But the Jolly Roger went missing following Jack's death four decades ago and has only just been found again by his delighted son Gordon in his sister's attic. He now wants to see the flag flying again. Mr Brown, 66, from Gosport, Hampshire, said: 'I was so pleased to have found it again, especially in such good condition. 'I thought it had been lost but I'd been nagging my sister to look for it and thankfully it turned up in her attic. 'Someone offered my £1,000 for it but I will never sell it. 'I want to see it flying again as it would be the first time since 1945 and then I will give it to a museum perhaps.' The history of HMS Tantalus is told by the symbols on the flag, with four bars representing the torpedoing of four ships and two daggers denoting the submarine's two 'cloak and dagger' operations. The eight stars in the top right corner surrounding crossed cannons represent eight times the deck gun was fired. Mr Brown’s father joined HMS Tantalus, which was a T-class submarine, at the age of 18. Gordon said: 'When my dad died he gave me the flag, a life jacket and his medals. Warship: HMS Tantalus was launched in February 1943 . Symbolic: Mr Brown holds the flag aloft, the symbols surrounding the skull and crossbones illustrate the submarine's history . Found: The flag flying atop HMS Tantalus at the end of the Second World War . 'I was only young at the time and I think I traded his medals for some marbles, which earned me a clip round the ear. 'I wish I hadn’t given away the medals now but at least I’ve still got the flag.' The first use of a Jolly Roger on a British submarine was in 1914 after it successfully torpedoed a German cruiser ship. The act was a humorous response to Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson's remark that submarines were ‘damned un-English’ and crews of enemy subs would be hanged as pirates. During World War Two British subs were allowed to fly the Jolly Roger on the day of their return from a successful patrol. The oldest surviving Jolly Roger flag, from First World War submarine E54, is on display at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Portsmouth. The Jolly Roger dates back to the 1700s when pirates flew it to make their victims surrender readily. HMS Tantalus was launched in February 1943 and served in the Far East for much of its wartime career. The submarine sank a long list of other vessels during its time in service including the Malaysian tug Kampung Besar and the Pulo Salanama in April 1944 and several Japanese Army cargo ships. The craft survived the war intact but was scrapped at Milford Haven in November 1950. The flag most commonly identified as the Jolly Roger today is the skull and crossbones, a flag consisting of a human skull above two long bones set in an x-mark arrangement on a black field. This design was used by several pirates, including Captains Edward England and John Taylor. Some Jolly Roger flags also include an hourglass, another common symbol representing death in 17th- and 18th-century Europe. Despite its prominence in popular culture, plain black flags were often employed by most pirates in the 17th and 18th century. Historically, the flag was flown to frighten pirates' victims into surrendering without a fight, since it conveyed the message that the attackers were outlaws who would not consider themselves bound by the usual rules of engagement—and might, therefore, slaughter those they defeated (since captured pirates were usually hanged, they did not have much to gain by asking quarter if defeated). The same message was sometimes conveyed by a red flag. Since the decline of piracy, various military units have used the Jolly Roger, usually in skull-and-crossbones design, as a unit identification insignia or a victory flag to ascribe to themselves the proverbial ferocity and toughness of pirates. In a non-naval context the skull and crossbones motif has additional meanings, for example, to signify a hazard such as poison.","Gordon Brown, 66, of Gosport, Hants, found the flag, which belonged to the HMS Tantalus in his sister's attic .

A pro-Kremlin blogger has warned Russian dissidents who flee to Britain they are 'cheats and pawns' and could face a sticky end. Nikolai Starikov was writing following the death in Britain of 44 year old whistleblower Alexander Perepilichny. Businessman Perepilichny had been assisting Swiss prosecutors in a case of suspected high level money laundering by Russian officials, prompting fears that an 'invisible' poison could have been used to kill him. Sticky end: Pro-Kremlin blogger Nikolai Starikov (right) has warned Russian dissidents who flee to Britain they are 'cheats and pawns' following the death of whistleblower Alexander Perephilichny (left) in Surrey last month . The case is similar to that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who died after drinking tea poisoned with radioactive polonium six years ago in London. Perepilichny was found dead outside his Surrey home last month and in-depth toxicological tests are being carried out. In his latest blog, Mr Starikov warned that those who betray Russia become  'pawns in a complicated geopolitical game. And they die because they do not understand it'. He suggested that Litvinenko was murdered not by those acting for the Russian secret services but by exiles in Britain. 'This is what happened to Alexander Litvinenko who was killed by polonium according to an ‘order from Kremlin’ as our English 'partners' say, but more likely he was poisoned by thallium salt,' he said, pointing the finger at a well-known exile. An author and journalist, Starikov is behind the 'Goebbels' Award' which goes to 'people who lie about, slander and vilify Russia'. On the latest mysterious death, Starikov wrote that 'three years ago according to the best traditions of Russian cheats, Alexander Perepilichnyy escaped to England and applied for asylum'. He then gave evidence to Swiss prosecutors against Russian officials. In a sinister phrase, Starikov said: 'In such situations the death is rarely occasional.'

'It is not just honourable to the honest . patriot to love your Motherland more than personal selfish interests, . but it is also very good for your health.' One comment darkly warns Russians: 'Here are the best traditions of  British intelligence for you.' Alexander Perepilichny . was a fit, energetic businessman with no history of medical problems, . when, it seems, he simply dropped dead in the one-acre grounds of his . seven-bedroom home. Yet exactly how he died remains shrouded in . mystery. His body was . discovered by a member of his staff in the early evening. He had . last been seen out jogging that morning and was still in his running . gear when he was found. A . post-mortem examination was carried out, which was inconclusive and forensic experts . are carrying out further tests for traces of poison. Amid growing fears among associates . that this wealthy individual was the victim of a sophisticated . professional assassin, forensic experts are working to identify any . lethal substance in the dead man’s organs or bloodstream. The extra tests were ordered — . following a routine autopsy — after Surrey police were informed that the . dead man had fled from Russia to Britain three years ago and had turned . supergrass against members of a feared Russian crime syndicate. The Coach House, home of Russian supergrass Alexander Perepilichnaya, can be seen at the top left of this picture of millionaires' luxury private estate, St George's Hill, in Weybridge, Surrey . Following the death it emerged that . Perepilichny had been warned via a Russian police official that his name . was on a hit list discovered in the possession of a known Chechen . hitman in Russia, who had details of his former addresses. The . death comes six months after another Russian businessman was gunned . down in broad daylight outside London’s Canary Wharf when a hitman . sprayed him with bullets. One theory is that the businessman was shot because he knew too much about a 2009 gun attack on a Russian banker in Moscow. Litvinenko . had fled to Britain with evidence that gangs linked to Russia’s . leadership were plotting the murder of Boris Berezovsky, an oligarch . who had fallen out with President Vladimir Putin. He fell ill after meeting a KGB officer and his associate at the Millennium Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square.

Dubbed . the Assassins’ Poison, polonium-210 is substance considered to be . 250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide. Toxicologists estimate . that a dose the size of a grain of salt would be fatal. The substance . used in the Litvinenko case was traced back to a Russian nuclear plant. If . polonium or another toxin is found to have been used in the latest . case, experts say it would not have been difficult to administer the . substance: for example, a food delivery bound for the victim’s home . could have been intercepted and tampered with. The . effects of polonium can take hours or days to become apparent — though . the poison can trigger a heart attack — and only specialised tests can . discover traces of the substance, which rapidly diminish after death. What was particularly chilling in the wake of Litvinenko’s murder was . the refusal of President Putin to hand over the prime suspect — the KGB . man who was at the London hotel on the day in question. When . David Cameron went to Moscow last year and demanded the suspect be sent . to Britain, he was told bluntly: ‘That will never happen, no matter . what the circumstances.’ Now, . with a Tory MP and a clutch of former Foreign Secretaries expressing . increasing concern about Russian criminals operating in Britain, . diplomatic relations between Moscow and London could plunge to an icy . new low if the death in St George’s Hill proves to be murder.

Toxicology . specialists have been brought in to study blood and tissue samples . after detectives learned the identity of the dead man. Certainly, Alexei . Navalny, a high-profile Russian anti-corruption campaigner, believes . the latest death bears all the hallmarks of a professional hit. ‘He . died at the age of 44, which in general is not typical, and there were . no signs of violent death.

Back on her feet: Tilly is healthy again after £2,000 surgery for swallowing a bone . Lisa and Neil Hilder were landed with . bills totalling £2,000 last year after their dog, Tilly, swallowed a . sharp piece from a bone they had given her as a Christmas present. ‘She had broken bits off and ended up . swallowing a very pointed piece,’ said Lisa, of Worthing, West Sussex.

Lisa added: ‘It . was quite nerve-racking and upsetting. We were worried as we didn’t know . whether she would pull through.

The 'Fiore di Cristallo' on display last night is currently the only model available in the world but prospective buyers who want the kitchen designed to their needs must join the eight-month queue. Speaking at the launch, Mr Zilli said: 'Claudio, in my mind, is an inspiration to all interior designers out there, whether you're designing a kitchen, a whole house and indeed one of my restaurants. 'As far as I am concerned this kitchen, the 'Fiore di Cristallo,' to me is the equivalent of a kilo of white truffles on my pasta. 'In other words, Claudio has combined innovative design with functionality faultlessly. This is ultimate luxury at its best.' Top design: Like this fridge, the cabinets can be encased in copper, which is regarded as one of the most hygienic kitchen materials because it counteracts microbes .

Launch: Guests take a closer look at the world's most expensive kitchen at the unveiling at One Mayfair in London last night . Mr Celiberti said: 'As a visionary designer who is committed to perfection, I wanted to create a bespoke space that pushed boundaries, exemplified beauty and defined ultimate luxury. 'The end result is a kitchen that is not only functional but also a work of art with each cut, component and flourish being nothing short of perfection, even down to the finest detail.' The name derives from the 'Cristallo di Murano', the world famous gems made using a complex and closely guarded technique on the Italian island of Murano. Copper linings were chosen because the mineral is acknowledged to have hygienic qualities as it counteracts harmful microbes. The chandelier is specially designed to bounce light off the reflective crystal surfaces on the worktops, drawing attention to the kitchen.","The Claudio Celiberti-designed kitchen, which comes with a £37,000 solid Murano crystal 'Island' and 27 crystal-fronted cabinets, costs £1m .

"Rescue mission could have endangered public health, claims whistleblower . Crew put future patients 'at risk of TB and allergic reactions' By . Hayley Dixon . PUBLISHED: . 10:11 EST, 29 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:44 EST, 30 November 2012 . Ambulance crews have been blasted for endangering public safety after paramedics stopped to pick up an injured badger and gave it a lift to the vets - where it was put down. Rescue teams spotted the injured animal as they returned from taking a patient to hospital at 3am on October 28. Their Good Samaritan act has been criticised by a whistleblower who claims they put public health at risk. The badger (not pictured) was spotted at the side of the road by paramedics who rushed it to the vets in their Ambulance (not pictured) - prompting fears for public health . South Central Ambulance Service NHS . Foundation Trust (SCAS) admitted crews transported the badger after . spotting it on the road near Banbury, Oxon. A worker wrote on Facebook: 'We found an injured badger in the road about 3am on night shift the other night. 'I rang my vet and we took it down to her in the ambulance. She put it down (it was too far gone for saving). :(' But the whistleblower, who has not been named, accused the service of endangering patients’ safety. They said: 'My concern is that it sounds like a dying wild badger was transported to a vet via an emergency ambulance. 'This is obviously a risk to patients and to the public - the chance of infection e.g badger tuberculosis, the risk of a patient being allergic to badger hair, possible badger bodily fluids etc. 'Was the ambulance thoroughly cleaned afterwards? Are people happy knowing their tax money was spent on transporting an ill badger?' SCAS confirmed staff had used an ambulance to transport an injured badger to a veterinary practice in Banbury on October 28, but denied there was any risk to public health. Spokesman James Keating-Wilkes said: 'In the early hours of October 28 an ambulance crew returning from hospital to base encountered what they believed to be a dead badger in the road in Banbury and, believing that this posed a danger to other road users, stopped to move it to the side of the road. 'On approaching the animal the crew noticed that the badger was alive and in considerable distress. 'They contacted a local vet who asked them to bring the badger in to a veterinary practice approximately half a mile from the scene, which they did. South Central Ambulance Service has a compassionate and caring workforce. The crew’s actions will be reviewed. At no point was patient safety compromised.' Despite the efforts to save the badger, it was taken to West Bar Veterinary Surgery in Banbury, Oxon., where it was put down.","Rescue mission could have endangered public health, claims whistleblower .
