"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Friday awarded posthumous Congressional Gold Medals to four African-American girls killed in a Birmingham, Alabama, church bombing that became a key and tragic moment of the civil rights movement. Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, all 14, and Denise McNair, 11, were killed during Sunday services on September 15, 1963, at the 16th Street Baptist Church. At least 14 others were injured. Three former Ku Klux Klan members were convicted of murder. Obama signed legislation at a White House ceremony granting the posthumous honor and acknowledged the families who pressed for the recognition. ""To the families who are here today, those who lost daughters and sisters, we just want to express incredible thanks not only for the strength you showed in suffering but also in your persistence,"" Obama said. President John F. Kennedy hoped in the aftermath of the bombing that it would spur action against racial hatred. ""If these cruel and tragic events can only awaken that city and state -- if they can only awaken this entire nation to a realization of the folly of racial injustice and hatred and violence -- then it is not too late for all concerned to unite in steps toward peaceful progress before more lives are lost,"" he said.","Four African-American girls killed in 1963 church bombing receive posthumous honor .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Senate committee approved legislation on Tuesday that would expand background checks covering all U.S. firearms sales, part of a federal gun-control push prompted by December's school massacre in Connecticut. The Judiciary Committee decision by a party-line vote of 10-8 cleared the way for the Democratic-crafted background check measure to be debated and put to a vote in the full Senate. Less clear is the fate of a proposed ban on military assault rifles proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. The panel put off a vote on that plan, but is expected to revisit it as early as Thursday. There is little expectation Feinstein's proposal, which President Barack Obama backs along with expanded background checks and other steps, will win congressional approval due mainly to stiff opposition from lawmakers aligned with the politically potent National Rifle Association. The background check proposal by Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, is also expected to face tough opposition once the full Senate takes it up. Maine town shoots down requirement for gun in every household . It is among the first gun-control proposals to begin moving through Congress since the school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, by a lone gunman armed with an assault weapon jolted the nation and renewed debate on the issue. A bipartisan effort in the Senate in recent weeks to put together background check legislation crumbled prior to the committee vote. One sticking point concerned checks involving private sales and what records would be maintained once guns are purchased. Schumer's bill would mandate background checks for all gun sales, including private transactions. It would also require increased cooperation by states with the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and would prohibit people deemed by the courts as unfit to own guns from obtaining them. In opposing Schumer's measure, Sen. Chuck Grassley disputed whether tougher background check laws would prevent criminals from obtaining a gun. ""Obviously, criminals do get guns. They obtain them because they do not comply with background checks,"" the Iowa Republican said. ""Supporters of this bill contend that if we only make background checks universal, criminals will not get guns. But criminals do not comply with existing background check laws."" New law lets South Dakota schools arm teachers, volunteers . Schumer took issue with Grassley's comments. ""On terrorism, on robbery, on murder, on money laundering, we never see the argument that we shouldn't have laws because the bad people will get around them anyway,"" a visibly frustrated Schumer said. ""Only on this issue and it makes no sense."" Whether the measure approved by the committee on Tuesday can garner enough support in the Senate remains to be seen. Finding Republican support has been tough. For weeks, Schumer was in talks with Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn in an attempt to find agreement across the aisle. Hours before the committee took up the issue last week, those talks fell apart. Lawmakers once supportive of Schumer's bipartisan effort, including Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, and Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, quickly distanced themselves from it when it became clear the legislation wasn't what they envisioned. The NRA has said increased checks are nothing more than an attempt to create a national gun registry, a move the group vehemently opposes. Georgia town mulls mandatory gun ownership . ""Criminals won't participate in a 'universal' system. They'll always steal or get their guns and everything else they want on the black market. Reasonable people know that criminals will never be part of the 'universe,'"" NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said on the group's website. Schumer said in a statement following the committee meeting that the issue of background checks remains the political ""sweet spot"" on gun control and promised continued efforts to find bipartisan support. A second measure was approved on Tuesday by the panel that would establish a framework for the Department of Education to set safety guidelines aimed at protecting schools from gun violence. The bill, proposed by Sen, Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, was approved 14-4 with bipartisan support. Before the committee vote Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he hoped for increased discussion on funding armed security officers in schools but voted in favor of the measure promising to negotiate details when it reaches the Senate floor. Last week, the Senate panel also approved a bill that would toughen laws on gun trafficking and straw purchases of firearms. Complete coverage: The gun debate .

"(CNN) -- The images still inspire. Children sitting on their parents' shoulders amid a sea of American flags, fluttering on a cool Chicago night. A young black woman running to get as close as possible to the stage. On November 4, 2008, Grant Park absorbed the world's focus: Barack Obama was elected president of the United States. His victory speech stopped the Earth from spinning, if only for an evening, and drew the world's attention to an America where anything was again possible. Obama's victory energized a pulsing crowd of a hundred-thousand, their dream deferred no longer. Journalist Lois Wille called it ""a great big huge happy evening"" that would perhaps ""wipe the memory"" of a more divided America away. Still, the podium was wrapped in bulletproof glass. Chicago charged all its 13,500 police officers with protecting America's great hope. It sent firefighters home wearing their uniforms so they would be ready to respond. We were not sure the promise and possibility of that moment was shared by every American. Yet that clear night, we celebrated the peaceful transition of power and the dawn of a different day. This is a good country, full of good and great people, dedicated to an extraordinary American promise, our commitment to equal opportunity for everyone. That evening, even the most hardened partisan hearts could feel it. Our country had taken a step forward in racial relations, a big step, something that spoke of what our nation might yet become. A good nation had become an even better one, where the scars of some old wounds had healed and the pain of intense divisions, though not forgotten, had receded farther into memory. Now the world is stopped no longer. How did we get from that America to this? Benghazi. The IRS. AP phone records. The failures for which Barack Obama will be remembered are not just those of one man or one administration. They are the failures of an old idea, that big, old, dumb, top-down, factory style government can manage the complexities of modern times. The institutions of the past had their day but can't keep up with the hyper-connected, adaptive society we see emerging. The attorney general says his department's secret acquisition of reporters' phone records is a ""matter about which I know nothing."" The then-secretary of state testifies she didn't know about and never reviewed specific security requests from those under her care in Benghazi. Our president learns about ""outrageous"" acts admitted by the IRS under his watch from the news media. These days, everyone takes responsibility but no one is actually responsible. David Axelrod explained it. ""Part of being president is there's so much beneath you that you can't know because the government is so vast,"" he told MSNBC. Exactly. So making it bigger and more expansive can only amplify its failures. This is the best Washington can do, not the worst. However, older industrial-age government is what President Obama insists upon. His administration still wants to control health care, retirement, the economy and almost everything else top-down, politically and artificially from distant palaces of marble. They want to run America from a bureaucracy so vast, its actions can't be known, even by those responsible for them. Yet the failure of Barack Obama's old ideas about governing may not be the most disappointing element of his legacy. Unable to accept the constant and consistent failure of ""progressive government,"" some of the president's defenders have already been reduced to saying that the attacks on Obama are unjust, launched against him, not on their merits, but because of his race. Chris Matthews of MSNBC could find no better way to rationalize the loss of his well known ""tingle"" than to explain that the country that just elected Obama a second time is inimical to his color. Matthews explained the dimming of Obama's halo like this: . ""The problem is there are people in this country ... who want this president to have an asterisk next to his name in the history books. ... They can't stand the idea that he's president and a piece of it is racism."" Matthews continued, ""It is the sense that the white race must rule. That's what racism is. And they can't stand the idea that a man who is not white is president. That is real. That sense of racial superiority and rule is in the hearts of some people in this country, not all conservatives, not even all right wingers. ... And a big part of it is bought into by people like John Boehner."" Back we go to the day when old wounds were open and divisions among Americans were fresh. No, Mr. Matthews, racism is not the problem here. This president can and is being judged on the measure of his actions. He is being judged on the content of his character, not the color of his skin. We've reached a good place in America. We have our first black president. Have we reached the place where we can have our first bad black one? Chris Matthews' hysteria is evidence we are not there yet. These next few months, Republicans, Democrats and the news media must conduct themselves better than this.

"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published this fall by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events. Julian Zelizer says interest groups have eroded the quality of America's democratic process. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- Last week, Americans saw some disturbing images. During town hall meetings about health care reform, legislators and citizens were loudly interrupted and intimidated by members of the audience who refused to let them speak. We don't yet have solid evidence as to whether the protesters were local citizens simply expressing their genuine concerns about the cost of the health care proposals -- concerns that have been showing up in recent polls -- or whether they were people primarily recruited and sent into these meetings by such groups as FreedomWorks, Americans for Prosperity, and Conservatives for Patients' Rights. At the same time, we did learn last week that a firm hired by the coal industry sent fake letters to members of Congress, allegedly from Latino and African-American organizations, opposing climate and energy legislation. The letters were sent on behalf of an industry group, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, by a subcontractor, Bonner Associates, a firm that manages grassroots campaigns on behalf of interest groups. The coal industry said it was outraged to learn of the fake letters, and Bonner blamed them on a temporary employee who it said has been fired. The incident brought to mind ""Astroturf"" campaigns, which are sophisticated lobbying operations that give the impression of an actual grassroots mobilization. While advocacy organizations have long worked on letter-writing campaigns to members of Congress -- where citizens are asked to sign and send letters in support of or against legislation -- the coal scandal provides evidence of a practice of claiming support without any consent. These events bring back memories of a movie that came out a little over 10 years ago called ""Bulworth."" In that film, Warren Beatty played Democratic Sen. Jay Billington Bulworth, a politician who came out of the liberal politics of the 1960s but had become disillusioned by the corrupting life of Washington. He is so distraught that he hires a hit man to kill him after taking out a multimillion-dollar life insurance policy. Yet after meeting an enchanting young woman, played by Halle Berry, Bulworth is re-energized. While trying to avoid the assassin whom he hired, Bulworth spends the weekend railing against the power of lobbyists and interest groups in the political process, explaining to citizens in one inner-city neighborhood that politicians will never pay attention to them because they don't contribute enough money. Though he is excited about life once again, the film ends with a lobbyist shooting the senator because he is frightened by the threat he presents. The film is obviously a gross exaggeration of what lobbyists will do to protect their interests. Nor should we vilify interest groups, which have always been part of our democracy. The truth is that there are many kinds of interest groups, dealing with all sorts of issues and reflecting all sorts of political perspectives. But interest groups have clearly eroded the quality of our democratic process. The most obvious way has been through outright corruption. There are many historical examples of how powerful interest groups tried to buy their way to success. American politics was rocked in 1905 and 1906 by revelations that the life insurance industry had bribed politicians. During the congressional hearings over Watergate in 1973, the investigation revealed that the milk industry had donated money to President Richard Nixon's administration and powerful members of Congress in exchange for favorable decisions by the Department of Agriculture. Lobbyists and politicians on the left and right have been guilty of these sins. The recent corruption scandal that has shaken New Jersey is a painful reminder of this dark side of our political system. Interest groups have also eroded the quality of our political system even when they are not engaged in corruption. Since the 1970s, there has been a massive proliferation of interest groups in Washington, D.C. The level of campaign contributions from these sources has steadily increased as politicians scramble to find sufficient funds to meet the rising cost of campaigns. The campaign finance system gives interest groups better access to elected officials. Now, interested parties are gradually extending their reach into areas far from Washington. We have seen the use of these tactics several times in recent years. In 2005 and 2006, for example, the nation learned how Jack Abramoff's lobbying firm worked with Ralph Reed's conservative organizations to mount Astroturf protests against state efforts to legalize gambling because they threatened Native American groups that were clients of Abramoff. If reports that advocacy groups have been behind the recent outbursts at town hall meetings are true, these revelations would signal a disturbing trend in interest group politics. Some liberal supporters of health care reform are naturally talking about responding in kind, fighting fire with fire. While this might very well create a more level yelling field, such warfare will crowd out legitimate efforts by unaffiliated citizens to talk about, question and debate the legislation with their representatives. But the danger is lobby creep, as we have seen with the coal industry's lobbying campaign. The concern is not primarily about rabble-rousers, who frequently emerge on the left and right at these events, employing disruptive tactics that we have seen since the 1960s. Rather the concern has to do with Washington-based interest groups and lobbyists sending people to local meetings to convey a specific and choreographed message, while preventing debate among actual local citizens. It is easy to foresee how interest groups can take this even further, sending their employees to impersonate local citizens while preventing discussions. Such tactics would dangerously threaten to close one of the few remaining doors in the democratic process to everyone other than those with the largest resources. It is not difficult to envision in the near future a surreal world of town hall meetings where legislators meet with a room filled with paid operatives from interest groups. These kinds of operations must stop. This is not an issue that can be solved through regulation, since our democracy must always protect and cherish the right to organize and mobilize politically. But citizens and politicians must not tolerate these kinds of activities from interest and advocacy groups -- even those that represent positions that they support. The stakes are high. We need to save what little room is left for civic engagement in America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Zelizer:  Interest groups are focus of controversy over disruptive town hall tactics .

"(CNN) -- Sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military ""are a profound betrayal of sacred oaths and sacred trusts,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told cadets Saturday at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. ""This scourge must be stamped out,"" he said during a commencement address. ""we are all accountable and responsible for ensuring that this happens. We cannot fail the Army or America. We cannot fail each other and we cannot fail the men and women that we lead."" Hagel cited similar admonitions made Friday by President Barack Obama to newly commissioned officers at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Sexual assaults in the armed forces undermine Americans' confidence in the military, the commander-in-chief said. ""That's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes,"" Obama said. ""Because they have no place in the greatest military on Earth."" Their comments came in the wake of a series of allegations of sexual impropriety in the military and an estimate that their incidence is growing: . -- This week, the Army said it had suspended Brig. Gen. Bryan Roberts, the top general at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, after allegations of adultery and assault. -- Last week, a U.S. Army sergeant first class stationed at West Point was charged with covertly shooting videos of female cadets in showers and latrines. -- This month, an Army sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at Fort Hood, Texas, came under investigation for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates. He has been relieved of duty while investigators look in to the allegations. -- Also this month, an Air Force officer who managed an assault prevention unit, was charged with sexual battery, accused of grabbing a woman and groping her buttocks and breasts in an Arlington County parking lot near his Washington office. -- The Department of Defense estimated this month that 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact -- from groping to rape -- occurred last year in the military, 35% higher than the estimate from 2010. The vast majority of those incidents went unreported as crimes, the study showed.

"(CNN) -- When Rob Portman signed on to the Mitt Romney campaign in January 2012, he was seen as a key supporter -- a rising star in the Republican Party, a swing state campaigner and a staunch conservative who could protect Romney on the right. For the next 11 months, Portman zipped around the country, pitching the candidate he said was ""exactly what our nation needs."" The Ohio senator's hard-nosed approach landed him on Romney's vice presidential short list. He was even vetted for the job. The Romney campaign was undoubtedly the height of Portman's political career. After he failed to deliver his state and Romney lost the election, Portman stepped out of the limelight and remained relatively quiet on Capitol Hill as President Barack Obama settled in for a second term. Until Friday. That's when Portman, a former White House budget director, was thrust into the divisive national debate when he publicly acknowledged that he had changed his mind on same-sex marriage. ""I'm announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples' opportunity to marry,"" Portman told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash two years after learning his son, Will, was gay. Will Portman 'especially proud' of father . ""I've come to the conclusion that for me, personally, I think this is something that we should allow people to do, to get married, and to have the joy and stability of marriage that I've had for over 26 years. That I want all of my children to have, including our son, who is gay,"" Portman said. Portman is an unexpected advocate for same-sex marriage -- and he admitted as much in the interview. ""What happened to me is really personal,"" Portman said. ""I mean, I hadn't thought a lot about this issue. Again, my focus has been on other issues over my public policy career."" Even though he is seen as a social conservative, someone whose social policy is deeply rooted in his Christian faith, Portman is noticeably out of his comfort zone in this discussion. It is budget and tax issues, not marriage and sexuality, that he is better known for. Portman was first elected to the Senate in 2010 after receiving little challenge from Democrat Lee Fisher for a seat vacated by Republican George Voinovich. While there, he has pushed fiscal issues, including a balanced budget amendment. This focus tracks with Portman's past. His first foray into elected office was when he won a House seat in 1993, representing Ohio's 2nd Congressional District. Portman stirs mixed reaction with same-sex marriage reversal . In that role, he began to hone his expertise on budget and fiscal issues. During his 12 years in the House, Portman sat on the Ways and Means and Budget committees -- two powerful budget and tax-writing panels -- and co-chaired the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. His expertise was noticed by the George W. Bush White House. Bush made Portman the U.S. trade representative in 2005 and he became the Republican president's budget director the next year. The job required Portman to dive into the esoteric world of federal spending. On his website, Portman describes himself as ""a deficit hawk"" that proposed ""a balanced budget,"" fought ""irresponsible earmarks"" and advocated for more transparency. Not everyone agrees with that assessment, however. Portman was only at the budget office for a year where he worked with the White House on its fiscal 2008 budget -- a document that led to a deficit of $459 billion. When Portman was rumored as a possible vice presidential candidate for Romney, nearly all Democratic operatives attacked him for his time as Bush's top budget deputy. Many said he portrayed himself as a deficit hawk, but didn't live up to those ideals when he worked for the White House. Greg Schultz, the Ohio state director for Obama's 2012 campaign, stressed these critiques in a blog post for the campaign. ""As one of the architects of the top-down Bush budget, Portman practically invented the policies that punished middle-class families while exploding the deficit, and crashing our economy,"" Schultz wrote. Portman, in the middle of the presidential campaign, even tried to distance himself from the Bush administration. ""I was frustrated when I was there about some spending issues â€” specifically, as you know, I wanted to offer a balanced budget over five years, and a lot of people didn't,"" Portman said in an interview with the Hill Magazine. ""I prevailed. The president sent his budget â€” not my budget, his budget â€” a five-year balanced budget. But it was a fight, internally.""","Republican Rob Portman reverses course, now supports same-sex marriage .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Flip through YouTube for five minutes and beyond the bad ""Star Wars"" parodies and nose-picking tutorials, you'll notice there are a lot of people out there who can sing. Really sing. David Foster is involved with a talent contest in which winners get to perform with him on tour. ""There's so much talent,"" says long-time record producer David Foster. ""Everywhere you go, there's talent that have no clue how to be heard."" But give 16-year-old Mia Boostrom props for having the right idea. She recently set up a camera in her Dighton, Massachusetts, bedroom, propped her guitar on her thigh, hit the record button then sang a breathy rendition of the Maroon 5 song, ""Secret."" Instead of uploading the video to YouTube in the hopes that a record executive might chance upon it, she sent the video to the social-networking site NameDrop.com because she'd heard it was hosting a talent contest involving Foster. (Her video is here.) Then she got a call: Would she perform with the 15-time Grammy winner on his October 25 tour stop in Boston, Massachusetts? The man credited for nurturing such talents as Celine Dion, Josh Groban and Michael Buble? Umm, yeah. ""My brother and I always joke around that David Foster has the Midas touch, and everything he touches turns to gold,"" Boostrom says. ""He's like the god of all music.""  Watch Foster talk about the contest » . Even Foster jokes about his eminence. ""It's good to be around me,"" he says. ""I think. Is that wrong to say that?"" Boostrom is one of 20 finalists chosen by Foster to join his ""David Foster & Friends"" tour that kicks off Wednesday in Chicago, Illinois. At each of the 10 stops, two finalists will perform on stage with Foster, one of whom will be chosen to compete in a final showdown at the tour's last stop in Vancouver, Canada, on November 8. The finalists will share the stage with a star-filled cast of musicians Foster is taking on tour with him. The group includes former Chicago frontman Peter Cetera; Earth, Wind and Fire's Philip Bailey; ""American Idol"" graduates Ruben Studdard and Michael Johns; and Charice, the 17-year-old Filipino newcomer with vocal pipes that some have said rival Whitney Houston's and Celine Dion's. The tour is a spin-off from the PBS special ""Hit Man: David Foster & Friends,"" in which Foster used the piano to accompany artists such as Andrea Bocelli, Groban and Buble in a showcase of songs he'd written or produced in his 35-year career. Foster says to expect special guests in each city, such as Richard Marx in Chicago, and Paul Anka and Neil Sedaka in New York. The contest aspect will give audiences a chance to watch Foster groom fresh talent, a process normally confined to sterile recording studios. For 27-year-old Rosalee Sher, a back-up singer from Las Vegas, Nevada, who's been picked to compete at Foster's San Jose, California, gig, this contest is far more appealing than ""American Idol."" ""I've always been a bit wary of 'American Idol,' "" she says. ""I think it's the whole television aspect. I may even be a little intimidated by Simon Cowell."" But not by Foster? ""Not so much,"" she laughs. ""I'm just really excited to perform with him."" But it won't just be the contestants who'll get a chance to prove their worth on Foster's tour. If you're in the audience, don't be surprised to get a shot at showing Foster what you've got. He says he plans to go into the crowd, mic in hand, inviting people to sing. As Foster was quoted on ""American Idol"" last season, ""In life, the microphone passes your lips but once ... you had better be ready to sing.""","David Foster offering unknowns a shot to sing on tour with him .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Five Americans on trial in Pakistan on terrorism charges appeared at a brief hearing Saturday, but did not face the detailed questioning they had expected. The hearing at the jailhouse in Sargodha, Pakistan, lasted about half an hour. All five suspects submitted their written statements, and the next hearing was set for June 9. The men's defense attorney, Hassan Dastagir Katchela, had told CNN he expected the five to be questioned in detail about the charges Saturday. It wasn't immediately clear why they only submitted written statements. Katchela has said he is confident the college-age men, who face life in prison if convicted, will be proven innocent and released soon. He called the allegations against them ""fake and baseless."" The trial of the men opened on the last day of March, with the defense accusing Pakistani authorities of fabricating evidence that the Americans plotted attacks on Pakistan. Their lawyers said the men planned no such terrorist attacks and were implicated by Pakistani authorities, who were under intense pressure to bring an indictment. The defense has said it believes some of the evidence obtained on the suspects' computers could have been manipulated. Katchela said all prosecution witnesses have been cross-examined, and he believes the defense will rest its case soon, perhaps ""following two more hearings after which the judge could rule on the case."" The group has been called the D.C. Five because they all lived around the U.S. capital. They have been charged with several terrorism-related counts, including criminal conspiracy to commit terrorism and waging war against Pakistan and its allies, including the United States. The five Americans -- Ahmed Abdullah Minni, Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan and Ramy Zamzam -- used to worship together at a mosque in Alexandria, Virginia, until they went missing in November and turned up in Pakistan. They were arrested in December in Sargodha, about 120 miles south of Islamabad, after their parents in the United States reported them missing. Zamzam's mother, Amal Khalifa, said last month the five men went to Pakistan for a wedding without telling their parents and were watching television when 30 armed men put guns in their faces and took them away. She said authorities held the men for 36 hours without food or water. ""They tortured them, they beat them up,"" Khalifa said. ""As soon as they fell asleep, somebody hit them so they don't fall asleep."" Khalifa said that during a visit with her son in prison and in a letter, Zamzam claimed the men were tortured into confessing. Nadeem Kiani, a spokesman for the Pakistani embassy in Washington, has denied the allegations. Sargodha Police Chief Usman Anwar previously testified that he has strong evidence that the five men planned to attack specific targets. Pakistani authorities have described the men as intent on waging holy war against ""infidels for the atrocities committed by them against Muslims around the world.""

"London (CNN) -- The BBC aired just a short clip of the Wizard of Oz song ""Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead"" on its pop chart show on Sunday -- not the whole song -- after sales of the tune skyrocketed in the wake of the death of Margaret Thatcher. A Facebook campaign has been encouraging people to buy the track to celebrate the former prime minister's death on Monday, and by the end of the week it reached number 2 in the official national charts. BBC Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper called the decision to play an excerpt on the Official Chart Show ""a difficult compromise,"" the BBC reported. On Sunday's show, a reporter explained the context to the song: ""Tributes poured in from across the world for Margaret Thatcher when she died on Monday, but there were also people who threw street parties around the UK. ""An online campaign began in 2007 to try to get this song, 'Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead,' to number 1 in the charts the week Lady Thatcher died."" A few seconds of the song, featuring the lyrics: ""Ding dong! The wicked witch is dead,"" were then played. Thatcher remains a highly polarizing figure in British politics. Many Britons blame her for creating soaring unemployment, when she reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to businesses and took on unions.

"(CNN) -- For years, prosecutors said, they padded their paychecks by virtue of their stature as leaders in Bell, California's city government. On Wednesday, they paid for it. Oscar Hernandez was found guilty on five felony charges for the misappropriation of funds stemming from his years as Bell's mayor, by the same jury that also convicted four former city council members on various counts. But it wasn't a sweeping verdict. Nearly two months after the trial started in January, the jurors also found Hernandez not guilty on five other charges, as they did with others. More acquittals -- and convictions -- could be coming, as the jury continues to weigh several counts pending against each defendant. And one ex-council member, Luis Antonio Artiga, cried in court when he heard he'd been found not guilty on all charges he had faced. ""You are free to go sir,"" Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy said afterward. ""Good luck to you."" The split verdicts for Hernandez, Teresa Jacobo, George Mirabal, George Cole and Victor Bello came two and a half years after the Los Angeles Times first reported salaries for them and others were well above the norm -- especially considering that Bell, situated about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, is a relatively small city of 36,000 people. Their indictments left a cloud over the city, which was mired in a financial mess. ""This community is left with a burden, a huge burden. Not just economically, but a burden of trust,"" current city council member Nestor Enrique Valencia told reporters following Wednesday's verdict. ""The people are ashamed of them."" Prosecutors alleged that the six ex-council members, as well as the two other former city officials, turned the city treasury into ""their own piggy bank, which they looted at will."" Between 2006 and 2010, they ""illegally gamed the system to receive ridiculous salaries for doing no work"" and were paid nearly $8,000 a month for meetings on four boards that never took place or lasted just a few minutes, prosecutors have alleged. Those boards were the Solid Waste and Recycling Authority, Surplus Property Authority, Public Finance Authority and Community Housing Authority, authorities said. Except for Artiga, the jury found the defendants guilty of misappropriation of funds for ""payment of services as (members) of the Solid Waste and Recycling Authority."" They were found not guilty of misappropriating funds while members of the public financing authority. Verdicts have not yet been reached on charges tied to the former public officials' work -- except for Artiga -- related to the two other committees. Hernandez's lawyer, Stanley Friedman, told reporters after the verdicts Wednesday that his client didn't knowingly break the law. He just took the salary offered him and did his job. ""I suspect all of us, if we got a job and they said you're getting paid $90,000 a year for a full-time job, we'd be pleased and we wouldn't do analysis of how the employer broke down the salaries,"" Friedman said. Friedman suggested that his client, at least, will fight the convictions thus far. ""These individuals didn't know that it was illegal,"" the lawyer said. ""... And I think they have very significant appeal issues, all of them."" Even with the jury still weighing some charges and more fights ahead in court, some Bell residents nonetheless took satisfaction in Wednesday's verdict. After believing her public officials had bilked her for years, Dennise Rodarte said she was happy that -- at least to some extent -- the jurors saw that too. And with that, she's ready to end this chapter in the city's history and move forward. ""It's justice,"" the clean government activist told CNN affiliate KTLA.

"(CNN) -- As we enter the final months of 2011, the thoughts of tech watchers like me are turning to what we can expect in 2012. Voice recognition in all our devices? Touch control replacing the mouse and keyboard? The death of the wallet as mobile payments become mainstream? Maybe. But what I'm most excited about is something far more audacious: flexible screens. Expecting this much-anticipated technology to become widely available in 2012 is optimistic but not unthinkable. Last week, Nokia demoed a mindblowing prototype handheld device that lets you bend and twist the screen to complete actions like scrolling and zooming. Meanwhile, Samsung said on an earnings call last week that it expected to debut phones with flexible displays in 2012 and that flexible tablets would follow. The advantages of flexible displays are obvious: They're more durable, and they pave the way for new input methods, such as bending the display to zoom. But where will this new tech take us? I think this technology will lead to the biggest breakthrough in mobile devices since the touchscreen. In fact, the next innovation in screen technologies may be an even bigger leap forward than touch displays. Think not of a bendable display but of a foldable one. You see, the biggest limitation of any device these days is screen size. There's a constant tension at play: You can have a small screen that fits in your pocket (your phone) or a big screen for home use (a tablet computer). But you can't have both. Or can you? The ultimate dream for these flexible displays is that they could roll up: Imagine a phone-sized device that could unfurl to be the size of a tablet. Perhaps it would be like an ancient scroll, a tube that unrolls to create a full 10-inch screen. Or perhaps a phone display could expand in two directions, making it useable both when collapsed and when unfurled. Ah, but why stop with our current form factors? Wouldn't it be wonderful if these devices could take forms more like the paper they replaced? While the transition from newspapers, magazines and books to digital devices has led to a few compromises -- those tactile forms are all reduced to a rectangular square of glass -- flexible screens can mimic the paper they replace. E-book readers might simply become single sheets of digital paper. Magazines and newspapers could be made up of multiple sheets that update their content wirelessly on a daily or even hourly basis. Where flexible screens might have the biggest impact, however, is in their ubiquity. The iPad remains an expensive device, but that hasn't stopped it popping up in unexpected locations. Some hotels let guests check in on an iPad installed with a custom app or even borrow one for the duration of their stay. Upscale restaurants are using iPads instead of menus. One auto enthusiast installed one as his in-car entertainment system. Another put one in his kitchen cupboard, calling it a ""kitchen entertainment system."" What will happen when screens are millimeters thick and virtually unbreakable? Simply put: The cheaper, thinner, more portable and more durable screens become, the more uses we'll find for them. And what could be thinner or more durable than a flexible display? Any surface could -- and will -- become a screen. Microsoft released a video this past week imagining what will happen when every surface is a digital display. It too is mindblowing. It's an exciting future and one that's rapidly approaching: If the device makers can pull it off, next year could see the launch of the first ""bendable"" phone. Let's hope so.","Last week, Nokia demoed a prototype device that lets you bend and twist the screen .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan was ordered Tuesday to serve 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. The judge also ordered Lohan to spend 90 days in a drug and alcohol rehab program after her jail term is completed. The actress must begin serving her sentence on July 20, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel said. After Revel ruled that Lohan had violated her probation in a 2007 drunken driving conviction by missing weekly alcohol counseling sessions, Lohan began sobbing as she addressed the court. ""I did do everthing that I was told to do and did the best I could,"" she said. Earlier, the alcohol counseling program director testified at the probation revocation hearing that Lohan missed nine alcohol counseling sessions since December, when the judge ordered her to attend weekly classes or face jail. Lohan has apparently not missed a weekly counseling session since May 20, when Revel ruled that there was ""probable cause to believe [Lohan] is in violation of probation"" from a 2007 drunken driving conviction. Lohan was ordered not to drink alcohol and an electronic bracelet was fitted on her leg on May 24 to detect if she did. The SCRAM bracelet measured an alcohol level of 0.03 percent in the actress' body at midnight on June 7, but reported a zero reading four hours later, Revel said during Tuesday's hearing. The alert would be a bond violation, but not a probation violation, she said. Revel said she would consider only if Lohan missed weekly alcohol counseling sessions, as Revel ordered in December. Cheryl Marshall, the director of the Right On program where Lohan has been attending counseling, testified Tuesday morning that Lohan would sometimes call ahead when she was going to miss a weekly session. A report from the program to the judge said Lohan ""kept making up creative excuses"" about her absences, prosecutor Danette Meyers said. Lohan's father, Michael Lohan, was in court for the hearing. The judge denied him a chance to speak, although she did accept a letter from him. Michael Lohan has been calling for the court to order his daughter into alcohol and drug rehab.","NEW: Lindsay Lohan gets 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions .

"(CNN) -- The moderator for Thursday night's vice presidential debate is Martha Raddatz, senior foreign affairs correspondent for ABC News since 2008. According to her ABCNews.go.com biography, Raddatz was ABC's White House correspondent during the George W. Bush administration, after serving as senior national security correspondent and State Department correspondent. She has traveled widely, including 21 trips to Iraq and multiple visits to Pakistan and Afghanistan. She has flown in an F-15 fighter jet over Afghanistan twice. Before joining ABC, Raddatz was NPR's Pentagon correspondent for five years, during which time she made numerous trips to Europe covering the war in the former Yugoslavia. Complete coverage: Presidential debates . In a separate profile on the site, Raddatz said moderating a debate may be scarier than going into a combat zone, ""because you don't wear body armor"" at a debate. Raddatz has won four Emmy awards, the 2012 First Amendment Award from the Radio Television Digital News Foundation, the 2007 International Urbino Press Award, the 2005 Daniel Pearl Award from the Chicago Journalists Association, and an Overseas Press Club Award for coverage of the 1995 assassination of Israeli statesman Yitzhak Rabin. The White House Correspondents' Association gave Raddatz an award in 2007 for excellence in presidential news coverage under deadline pressure. What would you have asked? Raddatz's 2007 book, ""The Long Road Home -- a Story of War and Family,"" was a New York Times and Washington Post best-seller. You can follow Raddatz, 59, (@martharaddatz) on Twitter. She was raised by her mother in Salt Lake City after her father died when Raddatz was 2 years old, she told an interviewer from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, site of Thursday's debate. According to the website NNDB, she never completed college. The conservative blog Daily Caller raised a flag on Raddatz on Wednesday, saying President Obama, while still a student at Harvard Law, attended her wedding to Obama classmate Julius Genachowski, whom Obama later appointed to lead the Federal Communications Commission, according to Politico. The Drudge Report and other conservative outlets subsequently raised doubts about Raddatz's objectivity. Photos: The Vice Presidential Debate . ""This is absurd,"" an ABC News spokesperson told Politico. ""Martha Raddatz is known for her tough, fair reporting, which is why it was no surprise to her colleagues inside and outside ABC News that she was chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates for this assignment. ""Barack Obama was a law school classmate of Raddatz's ex-husband Julius Genachowski at Harvard. At the time Barack Obama was a student and president of the Law Review. He attended their wedding over two decades ago along with nearly the entire Law Review, many of whom went on to successful careers including some in the Bush administration.

Raddatz broke up a White House press briefing in January 2007 when her cell phone suddenly started ringing loudly to the tune of ""Ridin'"" by Chamillionaire. White House spokesman Tony Snow's reaction -- ""Does Martha have a hip-hop ringtone?"" -- prompted raucous laughter from her fellow journalists while she scrambled to silence the phone.

"(CNN) -- If Tiger Woods fails in his double bid to retain the Bay Hill title and regain his world No. 1 ranking this weekend, then it's a fair bet he'll be ruing his late lapses on the opening two days. The 14-time major winner surrendered two strokes at the last two holes on Thursday, and lost three at the final three on Friday to be four off the lead at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. ""I played way better than what I scored today,"" Woods said on the PGA Tour website. ""I missed a couple of short ones, and I had a rough finish."" It was another frustrating finish for the 37-year-old, who started the tournament in high spirits after publicly acknowledging his relationship with skiing star Lindsey Vonn. He last held the No. 1 ranking in late October 2010, having occupied it for 281 weeks before a marital scandal that ended in in his divorce. Added to injury problems, he dropped as low as 58th in the standings before resurrecting his career with three titles last year and two more this season. Woods started the second round with a promising birdie and then eagled the par-five sixth hole before picking up further shots at 11 and 13. However, it all went wrong as he bogeyed 16, 17 and 18 to drop to a tie for seventh place on five-under-par 139, having carded 70 after his opening 69. ""The good news is we've got 36 holes to go,"" said Woods, who seeking to join Sam Snead as the only player to win the same tournament eight times. ""Certainly four shots can be made up. ""I've made my share of mistakes on the last few holes the last couple days. I need to clean that up."" Alongside him were fellow former world No. 1 Vijay Singh and fellow American Mark Wilson, who both moved up from 15th overnight with their 68s. Bill Haas joined overnight leader Justin Rose at the top, with both on 135 after shooting 66 and 70 respectively. Englishman Rose dropped a shot at his final hole, while American Haas had earlier finished strongly with an eagle at 16 -- emulating Woods' opening-day effort. Haas, whose wife is due to deliver their first child in two months, is battling neck pain he suffered reaching down to pick up a towel at the Northern Trust Open. ""We should call it a sore neck, not an injury. When you're playing poorly, it hurts, and when you're playing well, it doesn't hurt,"" he said. John Huh, born in New York to South Korean parents, dropped to third on 136 after a 69, while fellow U.S. players Ken Duke, J.J Henry and Jimmy Walker were tied for fourth on 138. Major champions Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson, Webb Simpson, Lucas Glover and Trevor Immelman all missed the halfway cut along with FedEx Cup series leader Brandt Snedeker. Mickelson, who will be seeking his fourth Green Jacket at Augusta next month, shot his worst round at Bay Hill -- 79 -- as he battles to regain the form he showed in winning at Phoenix last month. ""From where it was a few months ago, where I felt so good and my ball-striking was some of the best I've ever had, it is a little surprising,"" the 42-year-old lefthander said. It was Snedeker's first start in a month following a rib injury, and he struggled with successive 76s.","Tiger Woods four shots off lead in Bay Hill title defense after more late mistakes .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband holds the title of prince but he may look more like a movie pirate for the next two weeks as he wears a patch over an eye. The patch protects an eye that Prince Frederic Von Anhalt accidentally glued shut Tuesday morning, publicist John Blanchette said. ""It was dark and he grabbed his wife's nail glue instead of eye drops,"" Blanchette said. ""It was stupid,"" Von Anhalt said after a doctor repaired the damage at a Beverly Hills eye clinic. When Von Anhalt returned to his Bel Air, California, home later Tuesday morning he moved his wife's nail glue from the couple's bathroom. ""She doesn't use it anymore,"" Von Anhalt said. Von Anhalt, 68, will have to wear the patch over his right eye for two weeks, he said. Gabor, 93, suffered an eye injury years ago when she mistakenly used ""crazy glue"" on her eyelashes, her daughter Francesca Hilton said. She has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Gabor underwent hip replacement surgery last summer after she fell from her bed. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge,"" in 1952, ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953, ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957, and Orson Welles' 1958 cult classic, ""Touch of Evil.""

"(CNN) -- The Soyuz capsule returned Friday night landing in northeast Kazakhstan bringing an American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts back from a journey to the International Space Station, NASA said. The vessel capsule needed less than three and a half hours to descend to Earth. The return, initially scheduled for Thursday, was postponed because of inclement weather at the landing site northeast of the Russian town of Arkalyk, NASA said. The American expedition commander, Kevin Ford, and Russian Flight Engineers Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin spent 142 days on the station after launching into space on October 23, 2012. The crew members spent their unexpected extra day in space reviewing undocking and landing procedures as well as working with the remaining crew members on the handover of duties, NASA said. Ford passed the helm of the space station to Chris Hadfield of the Canadian Space Agency. Hadfield and his crewmates, U.S. astronaut Tom Marshburn and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko, will oversee the space station until the arrival of the next crew in two weeks, according to NASA. The journey up to the station takes longer than the return trip to Earth, NASA said. The Soyuz needs a total of two days to catch up with the ISS in its orbit.

"(CNN) -- The Greek footballer who achieved global infamy on Saturday after celebrating a goal with a fascist salute has been barred by his club until the end of the season. Having already been issued with a life ban from the Greek national team for his actions in the 2-1 league win over Veria, Giorgos Katidis has now been sanctioned by AEK Athens as well. The move follows widespread criticism of the 20-year-old's behavior, with many commentators expressing disbelief at the player's claim that he was ignorant of the full meaning of his actions. In a statement, AEK confirmed rumors that the club future of the onetime Greek under-19 captain is now in serious question. ""The board has decided to suspend Katidis until the end of the 2012-13 season, taking into consideration the horrific image his behavior provoked and has imposed the highest possible fine according to internal regulations,"" the club said. ""Whether he continues or not at the club will be decided in the summer after giving him the chance to prove his behavior was the result of immaturity and after assessing whether his re-introduction into the side will be possible without creating shockwaves to AEK."" A section of AEK's support -- influential fan group Original 21 -- has already said that it wishes to see Katidis expelled from the club. Champions on 11 occasions prior to a recent slump caused, in part, by enormous debts, AEK has long been proud of its reputation as a club with a left-wing feel. It was founded in 1924 by Greek refugees from Constantinople (now Istanbul) -- with AEK standing for Athletic Union of Constantinople in English -- following the Greco-Turkish war of 1919-1922. An example of the club's political leanings came when AEK played a friendly in Belgrade against local side Partizan in April 1999, a fortnight into NATO's bombing campaign of Serbia, in a show of solidarity. Given this background, not to mention Germany's detested wartime occupation of Greece and the recent rise of neo-fascist political party Golden Dawn, Katidis has since admitted the ""stupidity"" of his actions. His club ban follows on from a statement he gave on Sunday, in which he asked to be dropped from the first team because of the way in which he had ""offended the history"" of AEK. His announcement came shortly after a man who steered Greece to the UEFA Under-19 Championship final in 2012 learned of his lifetime ban from the senior national team by the Hellenic Fooball Federation. ""I made the mistake so I will be the one to pay for it -- AEK is not responsible,"" Katidis' statement read. ""So that is why I have decided to put myself out of the team because I have now realized how much I have offended the history of the club. ""I sincerely apologize to my team mates and everyone involved with the club that I insulted in not knowing exactly what I had done in my celebration. Nonetheless, the fact that I did not know what I was doing is no excuse."" The sentiment was shared by many around the world and particularly in Greece, where the midfielder's actions came on the very weekend that marked the 70th anniversary of Greek Jew deportations to German concentration camps. Although his 84th minute goal helped lift troubled AEK four points clear from the relegation zone, Katidis will play no further role in the remaining two months of the season as the traditional giants of the Greek game try to avoid the first relegation in their long history.","AEK Athens bans Giorgos Katidis until end of season for controversial goal celebration .

"Watertown, Massachusetts (CNN) -- First there was a burst of gunfire. Then a series of blasts. Then, less than an hour later, cheers. After a day-long massive manhunt for one Boston Marathon bombing suspect that terrorized several cities and riveted a nation, the shouting and applause on the streets of Watertown, Massachusetts, was a welcome sign of victory. Police shouted, ""Yay!"" Neighbors clapped. Residents and reporters who had been anxiously waiting on a nearby corner saw a concrete sign of progress. Police began leaving the backyard of a Watertown home where suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev had been holed up in a boat. A law enforcement vehicle with tinted windows drove by the crowd. When someone asked whether they have the suspect in custody, a police officer said, ""Yes"" -- and the crowd of residents erupted in cheers again. Minutes later, a series of Twitter posts from the Boston Police Department trumpeted the news. ""CAPTURED!!!"" one post said. ""The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over. And justice has won. Suspect in custody."" In Watertown, it wasn't long before SWAT teams shouted over a loudspeaker: ""Thank you, thank you! It was a pleasure! USA! USA!"" The crowd joined in. Watertown resident Mary Sullivan was among those cheering. She was walking her young black Labrador, Lucy, when gunshots rang out in her neighborhood on Friday. She waited for word on the fate of the suspect at the corner of Franklin and Mount Auburn with dozens of other residents. ""I'm glad it's over,"" she said. ""The city and the people have gone through so much pain over these irrational decisions of these young men."" Jubilant crowds celebrated beyond Watertown's borders. Residents, once holed up in houses and apartment buildings across the Boston area, poured out onto downtown streets. Music blared as revelers brandished American flags across the city. Near Boston's Northeastern University, students hugged each other, waved flags and chanted, ""Let's go Boston!"" and ""USA, USA!"" Myles Marcus, a student at Berklee College of Music, said he was happy to join the celebration. ""We've all been watching the TV, the computer, the live updates since the beginning of this whole thing,"" he said. ""I just feel relieved. I feel like I can go back to school now and know that I'm safe."" Some were more hesitant as celebrations unfolded across the city. ""There's always this thing in the back of my head that wonders if all this is a little premature,"" said Sara Pradziak, 21, who looked on as mostly college-age revelers filled Hemingway Street in downtown Boston. Boston police quickly worked to disperse the expanding group. ""Folks, do us a favor,"" one officer said. ""If you want to thank us, just go home."" And yet, several officers smiled as the crowd greeted their slow-moving motorcycle line with enthusiastic cheers and applause. At least two ambulances screeched past the Friday night celebrations, sirens blaring -- a sober reminder of the deadly week that many in Boston said they hoped had finally come to an end. Across the country, on a packed Delta 757 flying from Atlanta to Chicago, passengers clapped after a flight attendant made an announcement over the intercom: ""Police have the suspect in custody. He's alive."" Sarah-Ann Soffer, 30, gave the flight attendant the news after spotting it on Twitter. Reading the news and sharing it with her fellow passengers was an experience the public relations manager says she'll never forget. ""Everyone, you could tell, was just like holding in their breath at that moment. You could tell there was that kind of sigh of relief. You could breathe again,"" she said. ""It was one of these moments, where you know where you are when they happen. ... I wasn't sitting on my couch. I was 30,000 feet above the ground, witnessing history.""

"Frederick, Maryland (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday told 149 regional airports across the country it would begin closing their air traffic control towers in April, but said it would spare another 40 towers that had been on the chopping block. The agency said the cuts are necessary to help meet $637 million in forced spending cuts. The tower closures will begin April 7 and will be phased in over four weeks, FAA Chief Operating Officer David Grizzle said in a memo obtained by CNN. Some towers were spared after the FAA considered appeals from towers, and consulted with the departments of defense and homeland security. Among those to be closed are towers at regional airports in Frederick, Maryland, and near St. Petersburg, Florida, that were built with federal stimulus money and have been open less than a year. Read the full list of tower closures . The decision ""will have both short-term and long-term effects,"" warned the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. ""These towers serve other important functions -- including law enforcement activity, medical transport flights, search and rescue missions, business and commerce and supporting flight schools across America,"" the association said in a statement. ""Ultimately, the partisan posturing in Washington that led to sequestration is the reason for (Friday's) decision and its destructive effects on aviation."" The FAA had been expected to announce the closure of 189 low- or moderate-volume towers staffed by contractors. Before Friday's announcement, it said it would consider keeping a tower open if the airport convinces the agency it is in the ""national interest"" to do so. New air traffic control towers among those on chopping block . A news release from the FAA quoted Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood as saying, ""We heard from communities across the country about the importance of their towers and these were very tough decisions ... Unfortunately we are faced with a series of difficult choices that we have to make to reach the required cuts under sequestration."" By congressional mandate, the FAA must cut nearly $600 million from its nearly $48 billion budget this fiscal year. Because the majority of its 47,000 employees are air traffic controllers, it is impossible to cut its budget without affecting controllers, the agency said. FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in the agency's news release that the agency ""will work with the airports and the operators to ensure the procedures are in place to maintain the high level of safety at non-towered airports."" Two Republican members of Congress -- Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation; and Rep. Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure -- wrote to LaHood calling for ""a detailed justification and explanation for how the FAA determined each contract tower would be closed."" ""It is worth noting that, the specified towers in the FAA Contract Tower Program were all operational in 2009, when the FAA received less funding than it will under sequestration,"" the two said in their letter. Their was no immediate response from LaHood or the FAA to the letter. Survey: U.S. entry driving visitors away .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded Thursday at a northwest Pakistan camp for internally displaced people, killing 12 people and injuring 32 others, police said. The Jalozai camp is located about 35 kilometers (22 miles) outside of Peshawar and houses hundreds of thousands of people who have left the country's volatile tribal region. Authorities estimate the car contained 30-35 kilograms (66-77 lbs) of explosive material. Three other vehicles were destroyed in the blast. People at the camp were returning after receiving their rations -- packages containing basic supplies like rice, flour and soap, according to Noor Akbar Afridi, the head of the camp. About 200,00 people live at the camp. Some of those injured and killed were with a World Food Program affiliate that distributes the food aid. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, of which Peshawar is the capital, is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of recent clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. It was formerly known as the North West Frontier Province, a name assigned during the British colonial rule. The ruling party changed the name to reflect the province's majority Pashtun population.","NEW: About 200,00 people live at the camp.

"(CNN) -- The United States announced new sanctions Friday against Syria and its supporters, focusing on Hezbollah's support for the regime and a Syrian oil company for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. The U.S. State Department sanctioned the refiner Sytrol for selling $36 million of gasoline to Iran in April. Earlier Friday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced an extension of sanctions against Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based Shiite militant group, for its support of the Syrian government. Hezbollah, which the United States has designated a terrorist organization supported by Iran, has provided training, advice and extensive logistical support to President Bashar al-Assad's military campaign against an uprising that began in March 2011, the department said. The agency accused the group of training Syrian government personnel inside Syria, and facilitating the training of Syrian forces by the Quds Force, an elite unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. ""Hezbollah's extensive support to the Syrian government's violent suppression of the Syrian people exposes the true nature of this terrorist organization and its destabilizing presence in the region,"" Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen said in a statement. Al-Assad's inner circle: Mostly family, like 'mafia' Friday's announcements came as fighting for control of Aleppo continued. Also Friday, Great Britain announced $7.8 million more aid for the Syrian rebels. The money is intended not for weapons, but for medical and communication supplies, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said. ""The people of Syria cannot wait indefinitely,"" he said. Hague's announcement came as shelling and clashes continued throughout Syria. Syrian security forces killed at least 180 people, including 75 in Aleppo, said the Local Coordination Committees (LCC) of Syria, a network of opposition activists. On Thursday, the opposition group said at least 134 people were killed. Syrian rebels arrested a number of pro-regime journalists while they were covering military operations in al-Tal, a suburb of Damascus, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Syrian state TV reported that a crew from Al-Ikhbariya TV, which is pro-regime, had lost communication with their office and that ""armed groups and countries that are supporting them"" are to be held responsible. Residents reported intense shelling Friday in a village in Hama, as well as in two neighborhoods in Homs, the LCC reported. An activist from the Al Midan neighborhood of Damascus told CNN that tanks were in the streets and smoke was billowing in the capital. Troops, he said, were raiding homes and arresting people. ""The situation is terrible,"" said the activist, who was not identified because of security reasons. Witnesses also reported shelling in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, the LCC said. Syrian armed forces were inflicting ""heavy losses"" on rebels in the neighborhoods of Al-Ithaa and Saif Al-Dawla, Syrian state TV said Friday. The Syrian government and rebel groups have been battling for days to control Aleppo, a key front in a conflict that morphed into a civil war after government forces began cracking down on peaceful protesters in March 2011. The International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday that its first convoy in two weeks had entered the city a day ealier and was delivering humanitarian aid. ""Our priority has been getting them food, clean water, mattresses, things people take for granted,"" said Rabab Al-RifaÃ¯, head of communication for ICRC Damascus. ""Though the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent are doing everything possible to assist civilians affected by the violence, it is up to the parties to the conflict to take every feasible measure to spare the civilian population the effects of the fighting,"" said Marianne Gasser, the head of the ICRC delegation in Syria. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent had suspended most of its activities due to the danger, she said. ""Still, dozens of volunteers have continued to work under extremely difficult conditions to meet the growing needs of the civilian population."" Strapped for supplies and personnel, health-care facilities were finding it difficult to treat the wounded, said the ICRC, which has 50 staff members in Syria. An activist who provides relief aid to Aleppo's internally displaced residents told CNN on Friday that fewer demonstrations were taking place in the city, but that security forces were using live ammunition against those protesters who ventured out. In recent weeks, thousands of residents of its outskirts and other cities, including Homs, had converged on its central district, many of them bunking with relatives or renting low-budget apartments located in the city's poorer areas, said the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the recent outbreak of fighting in Aleppo itself has led many of those who had sought safety there to flee again, the activist said. ""Most of those people would come and ask us, 'Where should we go now? Is there a safe place left in Syria so we can go to?'"" he said. Many residents who had fled the devastated city of Homs opted to return there; others chose to stick it out in Aleppo, seeking shelter in schools located in safer areas, the activist said. ""Today, there around 50-60 schools open for the displaced; the average number of people in these schools is around 250."" He described the conditions in the schools as ""terrible."" Most Aleppo residents favor neither side in the battle, but most of the displaced residents hate the regime, he said. ""Even informants and members of security forces who had to flee their areas with their families despise the regime now,"" he added. But others blame Free Syrian Army fighters, saying government forces and troops would not have shelled their homes had it not been for the FSA's presence in their neighborhoods, he said. Roughly 17,000 people have been killed since the fighting began, the United Nations said last month. The opposition has put the toll at more than 20,000. Two days in Aleppo: Guns, graveyards and stairwell beds . Civilians in Aleppo were increasingly at risk from aerial attacks, artillery shelling and gunfire, Human Rights Watch said Friday. ""As Syria deploys helicopters, fighter jets, tanks, and heavy artillery in populated areas of Aleppo, it should do everything feasible to protect civilians from harm,"" said Anna Neistat, acting emergencies director at Human Rights Watch. ""At the same time, the Free Syrian Army forces in and around the city should do what they can to minimize the risk to civilians in the fighting."" The bloodshed has prompted increasing numbers of Syrians to flee into Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, the United Nations refugee agency said Friday. Almost 150,000 Syrians are now living as refugees, the agency said. What does Iran get for supporting al-Assad? In Turkey alone, the refugee population has exceeded 50,000, with more than 6,000 new arrivals -- many from the Aleppo area -- this week. Syria's harshest critics, including the United States, were absent from a meeting called this week by Iran to discuss the crisis. More than two dozen countries -- including Syria's allies China and Russia -- did attend. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi called the meeting a success, Iran's state-run news agency IRNA reported Friday. ""Attendance of more than 30 countries at the conference shows its success, and we hope that more countries whose policies correspond and are in line with Iran's diplomacies attend similar conferences in the future,"" the foreign minister said, according to IRNA. A spokesman for the opposition Syrian National Council said the problem had nothing to do with finding places to hold conferences. ""The main problem is to stop the regime from mass-murdering innocent civilians and shelling every city in Syria,"" said George Sabra. CNN exclusive: Inside Syria .

"(CNN) -- At least two people were killed and as many as 120 injured in Thanksgiving pileups involving an estimated 100 cars on a foggy stretch of highway in southeast Texas, authorities said. The first accident -- a multi-car wreck in the eastbound lands of Interstate 10 -- occurred about 8:45 a.m., according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Chain-reaction crashes followed, the department said in a news release, and included several accidents in the westbound lanes of the intersate, southwest of Beaumont in Jefferson County. ""Initial reports at the time of the crash indicated there was dense fog, which could be a contributing factor to those crashes,"" Texas Highway Patrol Trooper Stephanie Davis said. The two fatalities occurred in the same vehicle, authorities said. The victims were identified as Vincent Leggio, 64, and Debra Leggio, 60, both of Pearland, Texas. The two were killed when their vehicle was hit from behind by an 18-wheeler, the Department of Public Safety said. Video from CNN affiliate KBMT showed badly mangled vehicles atop one another and people who appeared to be injured stretched out in grass alongside the highway and on ambulance gurneys. Long lines of cars, each battered and some appearing to be totaled, lined the roadway. The vehicles included cars, minivans, pickups, tractor-trailer trucks and at least one FedEx truck. In several pictures, there appeared to be a slight sheen of fog. It was not known exactly how many injuries resulted from the accidents, said Davis. Jefferson County Deputy Sheriff Rod Carroll said that at least 80 and as many as 120 injured people were taken from the scene. The most seriously injured were being transported to Houston, about 75 miles away. Several victims were transported to neighboring hospitals in Beaumont and Port Arthur. The role of fog and the causes of the accidents were still under investigation, Davis said. Westbound lanes of the interstate were closed for nearly four hours before being reopened. The eastbound lanes of I-10 were closed after the accident throughout most of the day, with the Department of Public Safety saying shortly after 5 p.m. that those lanes had been cleared of debris and reopened.","After being closed for hours following the accident, all lanes of Interstae 10 reopened .

"(CNN) -- In Chicago in 1968, anti-war protesters at the Democratic National Convention chanted ""The Whole World Is Watching."" World news events of the past had few reporting electronically, but hundreds are in Iran. They were talking about television cameras that showed police beatings on the evening news. More than 40 years later, with a massive movement aimed at reversing election results and possibly even toppling a regime in Iran, online networking is instantly sharing protesters' actions. And the whole world is watching. ""That wasn't true in Chicago,"" Clay Shirky, a writer, consultant and New York University instructor who focuses on the social impact of the Internet, said of the slogan. ""Now, it's true."" The watching isn't the end of the story -- and may not even end up being its most important piece -- according to Shirky. ""Since we don't know how this ends, the lessons are all provisional at the moment,"" he said. ""But it seems to me that the biggest potential difference right now is not just that the whole world is watching, but that people from outside -- civilians from outside -- Iran are trying to actually affect the outcome."" From the moment Iranians took to the streets of Tehran to protest results of an election they believe President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stole, electronic media has been a part of the story. Demonstrators made plans by text message -- when they could get around reported government interference with their signals. Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube were used to organize, drum up support and share images of street protests -- and the brutal retribution that sometimes followed -- with a world hungry for news. As the Iranian government began limiting the freedom of traditional news outlets to report in the country, citizen journalists became crucial in showing scenes from the movement. It's the latest step forward in a media technology march that has included stops at the Spanish-American War, when telegraphs wired updates to the world, and the Vietnam War, when television first gave viewers a daily look at how the conflict was going. ""Every new technology gives those at home, or for that matter in the war rooms, a different way [to see] and perhaps a larger perspective on what's out there,"" said Susan Moeller, director of the University of Maryland's International Center for Media and the Public Agenda. ""In Vietnam, you might have had two or three networks out there covering it -- you could count on your fingers the number of perspectives on what was going on,"" she said. ""Today, you have the ability to literally have hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands, of perspectives from people not only of different geographical perspectives, but also from different cultural and philosophical perspectives."" Moeller said online networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have ""come into flowering"" since even the most recent world events, like natural disasters or political upheavals, that have garnered widespread attention. The growing number of people becoming Web-savvy makes the online networks more powerful, she said. ""It's not just the half-dozen geeks that used to be part of the HAM radio network, but millions of people have figured out how to sign up at Facebook and can get to [opposition candidate Mir Hossein] Moussavi's Facebook site."" Sarah Jaffe, a blogger and self-professed ""new media geek"" living in New York, is among those who have tuned in to the action in Iran through online media. In a blog Thursday titled, ""Iran Protests: It's not about Twitter, it's not about us,"" she noted the important role the Internet has played in spreading the word and engaging the public. But at the end of the day, she said, the online tools are just that -- tools. And the real story is the massive, nonvirtual movement in Iran. ""I love Twitter and all that stuff ... but it's not all about us,"" she said to CNN Thursday. ""We wouldn't be paying attention on Twitter if it were not for thousands and possibly millions of people in the street."" Helping free up Internet access for Iranians creates a way for people all over the world to show support for those protesters from the comfort of their own homes, Shirky said. ""One of the easy criticisms to make of people on Facebook and Twitter is, 'You're changing your avatar picture to green [the color Moussavi supporters wear]. Isn't that sweet? How pointless,"" he said. ""But one of the things that emboldens people turning out in the streets is visible evidence that there's an audience outside their immediate area."" The online activism does raise some unanswered questions, though, according to Shirky. He said some of them are troubling. He noted that some of the Americans working to help Iranian dissidents fight their own government were among those who criticized former U.S. President George W. Bush for pushing for regime change in neighboring Iraq. ""It's a kind of civilian diplomacy,"" he said. ""The regime will certainly use this as evidence of American meddling and it is American meddling,"" he said. ""It's just not meddling by the American state."" The anonymity of online citizen journalism also presents problems for people trying to process the news. While some bloggers and frequent users of networking sites have become trusted names among followers of news out of Iran, it can be otherwise difficult to figure out who the source of a piece of information is. ""It puts a demand on the person at home to make sense of it,"" Moeller said. ""And to be able to add some context and so forth."" Suspicion of intentional misinformation from the Iranian government also has rippled through the networks. For example, a Twitter user claiming to be an Iranian student was posting misinformation Wednesday -- including a report that demonstrations had been canceled -- and listed a phone number for a supposed safe house for protesters. And while it's impossible to deny the game-changing impact the Internet is having on the Iranian situation, there's no guarantee it will help topple Iran's hard-line leadership, according to Moeller. ""It doesn't mean we're going to see the brand new day of Iran dawning,"" she said. ""But the technology is there to stay. You can't pull the plug on the Internet.""","Experts on Iran: Online world is watching, acting .

"New York (CNN) -- Dumpster-lined streets and sidewalks strewn with destroyed art hint at the damage Hurricane Sandy wreaked on New York's most important art district last week; but as electricity slowly returns and flood waters recede, the impact of the ""super storm"" is still uncertain in New York's downtown Chelsea neighborhood. ""Chelsea is the center of America for contemporary art,"" Zach Feuer, owner of Zach Feuer gallery, told CNN. ""This is a big cultural loss."" The destruction has left the contemporary and modern art world reeling, and as the recovery effort continues the massive creative and monetary toll is rising fast. ""I would not be surprised if, when it's all said and done, the damage that is done to our art world will be in the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in unrecoverable work,"" gallery owner Leo Koenig said. The storm that broke records -- and hearts . What caused so much damage? When the surge from Hurricane Sandy pushed water levels to record highs on Monday night, flooding from the Hudson River quickly filled basements and street level facilities that are used primarily for art storage and exhibitions in Chelsea. In many cases, precautionary sandbags and sealants were washed away easily, and even works that were elevated high on the wall were soaked by morning. As the storm subsided, gallery owners and managers returned early on Tuesday, but much of the permanent damage had already been done. Gallery owner Derek Eller returned to his building but couldn't operate his electric gate because of the power outage. From a back window he was able to see boxes on the ground floor that had floated up when flooding in his 1,800-square-foot basement nearly reached the ceiling. ""It's a disaster, pieces are lost forever,"" Eller said after emerging from his still-soaked basement. ""We have been saving works over the past three days."" Storm victims' latest adversary: Cold . Koenig sealed the bottom of the entrance to his space in preparation for the hurricane. ""My common sense told me that if there was a foot and a half of water standing on 23rd Street, the world was about to end,"" he said. But when Koenig opened his doors the following day, water trapped in the gallery all night by the sealant came gushing out onto the sidewalk. While many returned to find their collections in ruins, some witnessed the wreckage as it unfolded. ""The surge came in and broke through the door, and knocked me down,"" Silas Seandel, a sculptor who lives above his studio, told CNN. ""[It] threw me and thousands of pounds of steel, and bronze, and sheets, all the way to the back door."" Remarkably, Seandel was able to return to higher ground and wait out the storm. From Eller's basement to those barely affected, galleries and conservators seem to agree that the priority right now is recovering as much work as possible and keeping it dry. ""The conservators were here immediately, there are trucks leaving with art constantly to get repaired,"" said Feuer, who estimates millions of dollars in damage to his gallery alone. ""The mold is kind of our biggest race, so there's a speed issue."" Other galleries have had to perform restorations on their own, reaching out to artists and conservators for insight during this crucial time. Marisa Newman, co-owner of Newman Popiashvili Gallery, gathered as much work as she could and raced uptown to her parents' home on Tuesday, knowing they still had power. Opinion: Sandy shouts climate change . ""I used their apartment for art triage,"" Newman recounted, ""I brought as much there, and we just cracked open all the frames, got everything out so they would just dry."" Newman is now using the space above her gallery to hold and restore other works. To further assist this process, the Museum of Modern Art and conservators from the American Institute for Conservation Collections Emergency Response Team, are offering official guidelines and ""a free public presentation on recovering wet art and cultural materials,"" according to an official release from MoMA. Despite the chaos, this generally competitive community has worked tirelessly to come together and ease the blow that Sandy has dealt, providing each other with generators, food and everything in between. ""This kind of event brings back the human factor to it,"" said Emilio Steinberger, senior director at the gallery Haunch of Venison. ""These are artists, these are dealers, people put their heart and soul into the art world and they're moving to save it, and put things back together."" How to help . This sentiment seems to be echoing through the galleries of the damaged neighborhood, and many have been adamant that Chelsea's art culture will not only recover but maintain its prestigious position within the art world. Seandel, who has worked and held exhibits in the same studio since 1978, has already insisted that he will repair and refinish all damaged works. ""I'm 75 years old, but I feel I've still got a lot of life in me, my work is still in demand all over the world,"" Seandel said. ""The thing about the New York gallery community is that it's an industry full of extremely intelligent, extremely capable people,"" gallery owner Cristin Tierney said. ""So, I really believe that as dire as things are now, we're going to bounce back."" Photos: New York recovers from Sandy .

"(CNN) -- Dylan Quick overcame a childhood disability and had big plans for the future. But on Tuesday, the 20-year-old student went on a stabbing spree on his Texas college campus, authorities said. By the time campus police took him into custody, 14 people had been injured at Lone Star College. It's unclear how many of the injured were stabbed and how many suffered other injuries. The campus shut down Tuesday, but will reopen Wednesday. Quick landed in jail. For now, his plans for the future may be in jeopardy. Overcoming obstacles . Quick was born deaf and received a cochlear implant at age 7, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. An article on how he overcame challenges early in life appeared on a Lone Star student blog the first week of April. The implant gave him the ability to hear, but he had to play catch-up to learn how to speak English. His mother homeschooled him and got him involved in Lone Star's library programs, when he was a teen, according to KPRC. Quick became a voracious reader and developed a close connection with the school northwest of Houston, where he later became a student, the affiliate said. He was planning to finish his associate's degree there and transfer to the University of Houston to study accounting. The young man dreamed of starting a book club. But Quick had also been harboring a darker dream, police said. Authorities: The rampage was premeditated . Quick told investigators he had fantasies of killing people and had been planning the attack for some time, sheriff's officials said late Tuesday. Quick used ""a razor-type knife"" to stab his victims, they added. ""According to the statement the suspect voluntarily gave investigators, he has had fantasies of stabbing people to death since he was in elementary school,"" a statement from the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. Quick has been charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, said Donna Hawkins of the Harris County Prosecutor's Office. Two of those injured remained hospitalized in critical condition late Tuesday, said Kathryn Klein, a spokeswoman for the Memorial Hermann Texas Trauma Institute. Witnesses described a chaotic scene. Bleeding victims collapsed to the ground. Students and teachers ran for cover. Some sprang into action, chasing after the assailant and helping the wounded. Cassie Foe was in the school's nursing lab when she heard a scream coming from the hallway. Moments later, the nursing student put her training into action, placing pressure on a wound in a stabbing victim's neck. ""It just seemed like he was just going around, basically getting whoever was more open and easiest for him to reach,"" Foe told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. Steven Maida said he saw so many people swarming that he thought it was a campus tour. Then, he saw them running and heard someone say, ""My friend's been stabbed."" Maida said he saw blood on a stairway and several injured victims. ""I just took off downstairs running,"" he said. He was looking for the attacker. Maida described joining a group of students who chased the suspect, tackled him and pinned him down until authorities arrived. ""I couldn't run the other way like everyone else was,"" he said. A bloody spree . Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Gilliland said authorities received an initial report that the suspect had been wrestled to the ground by a student before campus police arrested him. At least one injured victim had what appeared to be the blade of a box cutter or an X-Acto knife sticking out of her cheek, student Melody Vinton told CNN affiliate KHOU. Vinton said she had just left her chemistry class when she saw the attacker stabbing people, aiming at their necks and faces. Soon, she was trying to help victims, ripping a paper towel dispenser off a bathroom wall to get enough paper to help stem the bleeding. ""I turned around, and there was just blood. Just blood dripping down the stairs, all over the floor, all over everyone's towels on their necks. Just a lot of blood,"" told KHOU. Lockdown . The school was on lockdown Tuesday afternoon while authorities combed the campus to ensure no other injured people or attackers were there, Harris County sheriff's spokesman Alan Bernstein said. While authorities investigated, teachers and students huddled together in locked rooms, said Marianna Sviland, a teacher who was in a faculty workroom at the time of the stabbing. ""Outside the window, I saw cops running around. I saw students running, and I realized something was going on,"" she said. ""It was scary."" Four injured victims ""were taken out on helicopters,"" Bernstein said. Tuesday's incident comes more than two months after three people were wounded in a shooting at a different Lone Star College campus -- the North Harris campus in Houston. CNN's Dave Alsup, Chandler Friedman, Jason Morris, Ed Lavandera, Greg Botelho, Paul Caron, Chuck Johnston, Ashley Fantz and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Dylan Quick, 20, is charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon .

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN)  -- American children aren't necessarily getting smarter or dumber, but that might not be good enough to compete globally, according to numbers cited Tuesday by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. The National Center for Education Statistics found U.S. students placed below average in math and science. He noted a special analysis put out last week by the National Center for Education Statistics that compares 15-year-old U.S. students with students from other countries in the Organization for Economic Development. It found the U.S. students placed below average in math and science. In math, U.S. high schoolers were in the bottom quarter of the countries that participated, trailing countries including Finland, China and Estonia. According to the report, the U.S. math scores were not measurably different in 2006 from the previous scores in 2003. But while other countries have improved, the United States has remained stagnant. In science, the United States falls behind countries such as Canada, Japan and the Czech Republic. Duncan told a room full of science and math experts of the National Science Board on Tuesday morning that this will hurt the United States as it competes internationally. ""We are lagging the rest of the world, and we are lagging it in pretty substantial ways,"" he said. ""I think we have become complacent. We've sort of lost our way."" He acknowledged that in some areas of the United States it is hard to find good math and science teachers. To solve that problem, he said, ""I think we should pay math and science teachers a lot more money. We pay everybody the same. We have areas of critical need -- math, science, foreign language, special education in some places. I think we need to pay a premium for that."" The National Education Association, which represents teachers, argues against such a proposal. ""Simply being a teacher of a hard-to-staff subject does not equate with effective instruction, and therefore, should not be rewarded in-and-of-itself through a salary differential,"" the organization says in a position statement. The fourth- and eighth-graders who were part of the mathematics testing have improved their average scores compared with their European counterparts, but they still lag behind their Asian peers in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Singapore. In science, fourth-graders have fallen behind other students even though their average scores remained about the same. The eighth-graders' scores remain about the same compared to 1995. ""It has huge implications,"" Duncan said. ""I think as a real economic imperative we have to educate our way to a better economy.""","National Center for Education Statistics put out special analysis .

"(CNN) -- Of all the inhumane conditions in the detention of immigrants, the most serious is simply the condition of being locked up. Detention means that parents are taken from their children and shipped hundreds of miles away to jails where visits are impossible. Immigrants who have lived in the United States for nearly their whole lives lose their jobs, their homes, and their livelihoods while locked up in Immigration and Customs Enforcement jails, trying to fight deportation to a country they don't even remember, often without even a lawyer to help guide them through the complicated morass of immigration law. That is why it was good news to learn that hundreds of immigrants returned home to their communities and families after being released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement from detention centers across the country last week in anticipation of the federal budget cuts . This action is moving us, as a nation, in the right direction. Locking up thousands of immigrants is not critical for the agency to fulfill its enforcement mission. And now, we've been given an opportunity to consider better alternatives. The impact of this decision was far more than fiscal savings: It brought loved ones home to their families, returned breadwinners to their communities, and released asylum seekers from confinement that exacerbated their past trauma. Having worked as a lawyer for eight years with thousands of immigrants detained in the Arizona desert, I have seen the devastating, and ultimately ineffective, results of our rapidly expanding detention system. Our office regularly received desperate phone calls from wives, mostly U.S. citizens, whose husbands were in detention. Often the husbands were the sole breadwinners. The women and their children faced eviction from their homes because they could not keep up mortgage payments. They were forced to go on welfare, and their children's school performance suffered. Among my clients were asylum seekers who fled persecution and torture in their countries, only to find themselves locked up behind barbed wire for months and even years as they sought protection in America. Since 2003, more than 2.4 million people have passed through immigration detention facilities in a network of over 250 jails and prisons. At an average cost of $164 per day per person, ICE spent more than $1.7 billion in 2011 to detain a record 429,000 immigrants. Much of this money goes to private prison corporations that have contracts to house nearly half of the immigrants in ICE custody every day and are looking to grow their business -- having spent millions of dollars during the past 10 years on campaign donations and lobbyists at the state and federal level. Immigrants in detention include lawful permanent residents with deep family and community ties, undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for decades as part of mixed status families, survivors of torture, asylum seekers, pregnant women, military veterans, and the infirm. No matter their background, they are confined behind bars for months and sometimes years as they await a hearing to determine whether they can remain in the U.S. legally. Conditions in detention are punitive and inhumane. A recent set of reports compiled by Detention Watch Network members highlighted conditions in 10 jails where immigrants are held that exemplify the egregious problems inherent throughout the immigration detention system. We found immigrants in detention wait weeks or months for medical care; have inadequate, and in some cases absolutely no, outdoor recreation time or access to sunlight or fresh air; are offered inadequate and nutritionally lacking food; and are subjected to the use of solitary confinement as punishment, as outlined in a report by the National Immigrant Justice Center and Physicians for Human Rights. Their families suffer extraordinary difficulties trying to visit their imprisoned relatives. In some facilities, families drive hundreds of miles to visit their loved ones, only to be forced to ""visit"" with them via video link in a separate building -- not because they pose a risk, but because the facility does not want to incur additional costs for in-person visits. The remote location of many facilities also interferes dangerously with people's ability to get legal help to fight their cases. They often have no access to a lawyer. In the words of one immigrant detained at Baker County Jail in Florida, ""We are like dogs, we can't see the sun or the sky. Actually, even a dog gets to go outside."" Since 2003, at least 131 men and women died while in custody in these centers, which include private jails, county cells and federal centers, according to ICE reports. It does not have to be this way. Alternatives to detention -- such as community-based programs that offer legal and social service support -- are effective and significantly cheaper, with some programs costing as little as $14 per day. These alternatives to detention yield about a 93% appearance rate before the immigration courts and allow people to remain with their families and communities. Given what we know about this hidden and punitive system, it is heartening to hear from members around the country that immigrants are being released from some of the worst facilities outlined in the reports. ICE should expand on this recent action by releasing everyone not subject to mandatory detention, and using alternative programs for those that are. The government's action must also be a part of a larger initiative to reform our immigration detention system. One critical step is the congressional repeal of mandatory detention laws that have been responsible for tripling the number of people in detention. Under these laws, up to 70% of immigrants in detention are required to be imprisoned, without any individual assessment of their risk to public safety, while the government tries to prove that it has the authority to deport them. This practice is contrary to our practice in the criminal justice system and wholly un-American. Until Congress acts, the Obama administration must renew its commitment to urgent reform of the detention system by closing the most egregious detention facilities, aggressively working with nongovernmental organizations to promote community-based supervision programs for those in proceedings, and pushing for legal regulation and third party oversight of the remaining detention centers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrea Black.","Andrea Black: Release of hundreds of immigrants from detention centers is good step .

"(CNN) -- A golfer's bid to raise money for the victims of the Boston bombings was given an unlikely boost when a record-equaling 91 players made the halfway cut at the PGA Tour tournament in South Carolina. James Driscoll is pledging $1,000 for each birdie he makes at the RBC Heritage at Hilton Head, but he was in danger of missing the weekend action. However, a missed putt by Jesper Parnevik meant that a group of 21 players -- including Driscoll -- moved above the cut line and went through to Saturday's third round. ""@JesperParnevik can I buy you a drink or 14 tonight?"" Driscoll wrote on Twitter. Driscoll, who was born in Boston, had a big group of friends at the finish line of the marathon when the explosions went off on Monday but none were hurt. ""I've had tons of players ask if my family is OK and if I knew anybody close by,"" he said on the PGA Tour website. ""The crowds have been good. I can tell they've been pulling for me with what I'm trying to do."" Driscoll carded seven birdies in 36 holes across Thursday and Friday, having set up a pledge site for donations. One of the bombing suspects was killed by police early Friday, while the other was taken into custody in the evening. ""Before the round I was glued to the TV and the news,"" Driscoll said. ""It's crazy when you watch the news, it's like you're watching a movie. It doesn't seem real."" Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs has pledged to donate $100,000 on behalf of the baseball franchise to the One Fund Boston charity, while the owner of its home venue, the T.D. Garden â€” shared with the city's NBA team the Celtics -- will put in $50,000. The Celtics announced Saturday that the team will seek to raise $200,00 through multiple initiatives. ""I think that's where it gets its reputation as a crazy sports town; people rally so hard around the local teams that it's such a tight-knit community,"" Driscoll said. ""People are quick to support one another and that's what I'm trying to do."" Usually around half of the 140-strong field at a tournament will be cut at the halfway stage, but Parnevik's 18th-hole miss meant that the weekend ranks were swelled to a number not seen since the 1981 Travelers Championship. ""Everybody in the field at +2, put your envelopes in my locker..."" tweeted Parnevik, who was one of 17 players to complete their second rounds on Saturday. Driscoll did not make the third-round cut, which is the top 70 players, having carded one birdie and two double-bogeys in his opening nine holes. He added another birdie to take his pledge total to $9,000 but was left in a tie for 88th after recording a 76. Driscoll was 18 shots behind leader Charley Hoffman, who will take a two-stroke advantage over 2012 U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson into Sunday's final round.","Boston-born golfer James Driscoll pledges $1,000 for every birdie he makes .

"(CNN) -- Argentina's president declared three days of national mourning Wednesday after heavy rains claimed dozens of lives. At least 48 people were killed in La Plata, outside Buenos Aires, officials said Wednesday. ""In 12 hours it has rained what it normally rains in the entire month of April,"" Santiago Martorelli, cabinet chief of the city, told the state-run Telam news agency. The rainfall in that period was 13 inches, he said. ""This storm is a catastrophe without precedent,"" Martorelli said. Some 3,000 residents of La Plata have evacuated due to the rain, officials said. Earlier, eight storm-related deaths were reported in Buenos Aires, the capital. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner toured some of the most heavily damaged areas Wednesday evening. ""I have come to see what happened with this disaster,"" she said as she entered a flooded home, according to Telam. ""I am not going to leave you alone.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Tables set in apple green, ruby and gold with arrangements of roses, hydrangeas and sweet peas awaited guests to Tuesday's White House state dinner. The place settings in fine china from three previous administrations -- Eisenhower, Clinton and George W. Bush -- are flanked by crystal glasses and five pieces of silverware. Place cards are handwritten, including two that read ""The President"" and ""Mrs. Obama."" The first state dinner of Barack Obama's presidency, in honor of visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, will take place in a tent set up on the White House South Lawn, with a view of the Washington Monument. Guests will sit at round tables for 10, with the floral arrangements intended to pay homage to the state bird of India, the Indian peacock, and the dinner featuring a seasonal menu reflecting American and Indian flavors, according to the White House. The first course will be a potato and eggplant salad made with White House-grown arugula and accompanied by an onion-seed vinaigrette. Red lentil soup with fresh cheese follows, and then a choice of entrees: roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, chickpeas and okra for vegetarians, or green curry prawns and caramelized salsify with smoked collard greens. Dessert will be pumpkin pie tart or pear tatin with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Each course is paired with its own wine, all of American vintage. Michelle Obama worked with guest chef Marcus Samuelsson and White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford to ""create a menu that reflects the best of American cuisine, continues this White House's commitment to serving fresh, sustainable and regional food, and honors the culinary excellence and flavors that are present in Indian cuisine,"" the White House said. The herbs and lettuces were harvested from the White House Kitchen Garden started by the first lady, and honey from the White House beehive is being used to poach the dessert pears.","Dinner in honor of Indian premier will take place on White House South Lawn .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Where have you gone Walter Cronkite, and why have you been replaced by the likes of woopig.net? Well, at least in the world of sports journalism. Bobby Petrino is no longer calling Hogs at the University of Arkansas, because somebody by the handle of ""hoggrad"" on that popular woopig.net website for Razorback fans first reported that the Arkansas football coach wasn't exactly watching game film that evening. Let's just say Petrino was the April Fool on the first day of this month courtesy of a motorcycle, a crash and a blonde. Then along came a police report, a lie and a firing. The story began on woopig.net, with much help from hoggrad, whose new handle should be Woodward or Bernstein. We're in a different place, folks. That's because new media have created a slew of investigative reporters among average citizens through personal blogs, Twitter, YouTube, talk-show radio, cellphone cameras and recorders, Facebook and fan websites. As a result, those who run professional sports teams have combined with athletics directors on the collegiate level to use a new approach regarding highly successful coaches, managers and others involved with scandalous situations: They whack them. Not only that, they whack them immediately, before their franchise or university gets embarrassed by several more waves of comments at the end of somebody's Internet post. Petrino fired as Arkansas head football coach . ""All of this (instant reporting of scandal) in regards to how it relates to the electronic media has certainly heightened the information and interest and lessened tolerance,"" said Georgia Tech athletics director Dan Radakovich, who has worked for big-time intercollegiate athletic programs for nearly three decades. He also is on the executive committee of the Division 1A Athletic Directors' Association. These intentional and unintentional scoops by nonjournalists go beyond college sports. It's just that the Petrino situation and others have placed those on campuses in the forefront of it all. ""(Electronic media) certainly has sped up the process. Before, it may have taken a lot longer to make a decision (on whether to fire somebody). You had to talk to a number of different people before you felt like -- or the organization felt like -- they had gathered enough information to be able to make a reasonable or rational decision,"" Radakovich added. ""Now I think that all comes a lot quicker. And, in some ways, there's an expectation that the decision should come quicker. I just hope that in these circumstances that the gathering continues to be thorough and that all sides of the issue are being reviewed."" No problem there. In January 2003, everybody saw many sides of Larry Eustachy, and it wasn't pretty. The Des Moines Register ran a photo of the former Iowa State basketball coach drinking beer and kissing women at a party near the campus of the University of Missouri after an Iowa State loss. The Eustachy photo was the first in a string of high-profile sports scandals broken by a random person. This one started when a reporter for the Register clicked onto a link on an Iowa State fan site that eventually led him to a fan site for the Missouri Tigers. Moments later, the reporter saw pictures in living color of a plastered Eustachy. They were posted on the site by a Missouri student who snapped the pictures at the party. The Register acquired the negatives from the Missouri student, published the photos, and Eustachy was fired. That same year, ESPN received an audiotape of a 2002 telephone conversation between the wife of Syracuse associate head basketball coach Bernie Fine and a former team ball boy. The tape featured Fine's wife, Laurie, confirming to that former ball boy, Bobby Davis, that she knew he had been molested by her husband. The tape came to light at the end of last year, and among other things, it contributed to the end of Fine's 35-year tenure under legendary Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim. There also was that 2010 tweet by former University of North Carolina defensive lineman Marvin Austin. It talked of parties and gifts for North Carolina football players, and those revelations led to the Tar Heels receiving NCAA probation, vacating two seasons worth of games and the firing of popular coach Butch Davis. Eustachy. Fine. Davis. Their firings were in contrast to what university bosses did in the past to guilty but effective employees: nothing. OK, little. If the situation was bad enough back then, university bosses might deliver a private or public reprimand. They might even clench their teeth while issuing a fine, a suspension or both. But firing such a person? No way. Not if we're talking about that generation's Petrino, who isn't in line to become the next pope, but who has those worshipping (as in giving financially to) the University of Arkansas as if it were the Vatican of college football. Petrino had a 21-5 record during the last two of his four years at Arkansas, and one of his Razorback teams earned a berth in the coveted Bowl Championship Series for the first time in school history. More impressive, Arkansas was picked as a contender for the national championship this season. If that isn't enough, Arkansas plays in the Southeastern Conference, where life revolves around breathing and football. So, if this were 20, 30 or any of those years before ""tweet"" meant more than what birds do, Arkansas officials would have shrugged over Petrino lying about being alone, when he left a ditch on the side of a rural Arkansas road with four broken ribs and a cracked vertebra after he crashed his motorcycle. College suspends woman in Bobby Petrino crash . They also would have covered their ears when their 51-year-old coach later confessed that he was riding with a 25-year-old female employee of the university named Jessica Dorrell. And that he hired Dorrell under dubious circumstances. And that Dorrell wasn't his wife or the mother of his four children. And that he gave Dorrell a $20,000 gift at some point for unknown reasons. Finally, did we mention that Dorrell was engaged to be married in June to Josh Morgan, the director of operations for the University of Arkansas women's swimming and diving team? Woopig.net surely did.","Social media is playing a role in some of the biggest college football scandals .

"(CNN) -- I am an American Muslim. When I was growing up in a small town in upstate New York, the America I lived in cherished diversity and the freedom to worship, regardless of one's religion. People of various faiths resided in my community: Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Mormons. How a person prayed was never a factor in how we treated each other. Yet today, Muslims in America are viewed as suspect and legitimate targets for surveillance by the New York Police Department because of their faith. This is not the America I know, and it is time for the courts to weigh in and ban discriminatory policing by the NYPD. Let me be clear: Anyone who engages in criminal acts should be stopped and brought to justice. But the NYPD can do that without targeting an entire community for blanket surveillance. The NYPD has been spying on American Muslims in New York as well as in towns, communities and college campuses throughout the Northeast. In New Jersey, for example, the NYPD visited mosques, schools, Muslim-owned restaurants and small stores and took photographs and videos of people and their cars, collecting information about ordinary people's daily lives, clothing and eating habits. Muslims have been a part of America since the first slave ships arrived. We have contributed to our nation's growth and fought and given up our lives defending it. Today, we are as diverse as our nation: We are white, black, Latino, Pakistani, Indian, Arab, Iranian and Indonesian. We are teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, store owners and business leaders. We are members of the military and Congress. But living freely as a Muslim in America today has become increasingly difficult. In New York and New Jersey, worshipers at local mosques fear that their discussions may be monitored and misinterpreted by police informants. Store owners wonder whether one of the customers might be an undercover cop looking to eavesdrop. Parents of college students caution their children about participating in Muslim student group activities. More than 100 faiths and civil liberties organizations have publicly objected to the NYPD's conduct. They are joined by numerous public officials, including 35 members of Congress. Newark Mayor Cory Booker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have voiced their objections. In addition, Reps. Rush Holt of New Jersey, Judy Chu of California and Keith Ellison of Minnesota have recently introduced a resolution condemning the NYPD's discriminatory practices and calling for an investigation of the NYPD. Despite all this outrage, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and federal officials with an obligation to enforce the law and protect Americans have refused to launch an investigation. That is why today, victims of NYPD's spying program have stepped up and filed a lawsuit against the police department, asking a federal court in New Jersey to ban religious discrimination by law enforcement. Since public officials with direct oversight responsibility have turned a blind eye toward this bigotry, the victims have bravely come forward, turning to the courts as a last resort. This lawsuit is about the pervasive and discriminatory policies and practices that Commissioner Ray Kelly and his leadership team have put into motion and that need to stop. Standing up to the largest police department in the country takes courage, and these brave individuals have done so in order to protect America's future. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit include college students, a military serviceman who has put his life on the front lines in Iraq and a small-business owner who is also a Vietnam veteran. They are ordinary Americans just trying to live a normal life, raising their families and supporting their country. These plaintiffs are parents, students, business leaders and service members who enrich our communities. Their only ""crime"" is that they are Muslim in America. Throughout our nation's history, the courts have often been called upon to protect fundamental rights and defend justice. Following this well-worn path, American Muslims are now raising their voices and knocking on the courthouse door, determined that our system of justice will protect the rights of all Americans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Farhana Khera.","Farhana Khera: Muslims are targets of surveillance by the NYPD because of their faith .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan must decide by March 23 if she will accept a plea deal that would send her to jail or move closer to a trial in the necklace theft case, a judge told the actress Thursday. Lohan would return to Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Keith Schwartz's courtroom on March 25 if she is ready to plead guilty or no contest to the felony grand theft charge. Otherwise, a preliminary hearing will be held April 22 before another judge, Schwartz said. Lohan's defense lawyer, Shawn Holley, must tell the court of her client's decision at least two days before the next hearing, he said. Judge Stephanie Sautner, who would hear the case in the event of a trial, would also consider the matter of Lohan's probation violation at the April hearing, Schwartz said. The actress faces possible jail time for violating her probation for a drunk driving arrest because of the theft charge. Schwartz told Lohan at a hearing last month that any plea deal would involve jail time. ""If you plead in front of me, you are going to jail, period!"" he said during the February 23 hearing. Holley previously said her client would welcome a plea deal, but only if it did not involve going to jail. Thursday's hearing marked Lohan's ninth court hearing in 10 months. The actress is accused of walking out with a $2,500 necklace from Kamofie and Company, a jewelry store in Venice, California, on January 22. The case against Lohan took another twist this week when the jewelry store sold the rights to the security video of Lohan -- which is key to the prosecution -- to the Associated Press for an undisclosed price. ""We hope that everyone understands that this is beyond our control, the flood of the requests to see this video were simply too overwhelming,"" a representative for the store said Tuesday. ""It was truly necessary to put it out."" The store owners said Wednesday they will auction off the necklace and donate the proceeds to charity. ""Sofia Kaman would rather the money go to help an appropriate charity, since at least that way some good can result from this incident,"" the store said. The auction will have to wait until the case is resolved, since the necklace is being held as evidence by prosecutors, the store said. The felony grand theft charge triggered a charge that Lohan violated her probation for a 2007 drunk driving conviction. The actress is free on bond on the probation violation and the grand theft charge while her lawyer and the prosecutor discuss a plea deal, or until a full hearing. The penalty for a felony grand theft conviction ranges from 16 months to three years in a California state prison. The exact term would be based on the value of the property stolen and the criminal record of the defendant. Shoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than $950. The store owner claims the ""one of a kind"" necklace is worth $2,500, police said. CNN's Douglas Hyde contributed to this report.","NEW: Lindsay Lohan will return to court March 25 if she accepts a plea deal .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A judge granted Lindsay Lohan bail Friday night, overturning a decision earlier Friday that sent the actress to jail until a probation revocation hearing four weeks away, a court spokesman said. Lohan can leave jail after she posts a $300,000 bond, but she must be fitted with a SCRAM alcohol-detection bracelet within 24 hours, Los Angeles County Superior Court spokesman Allan Parachini said. Judge Patricia Schnegg granted Lohan's bail after her lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, filed a writ of habeas corpus just before court closed Friday afternoon, Parachini said. ""I pray to God that Shawn does the right thing and advises her to go right into rehab now, and show the judge she's serious, because in 30 days when she goes back before the judge he can do whatever he wants,"" Michael Lohan, her father, told CNN. Judge Eldin Fox ordered the preliminary revocation of Lohan's probation Friday morning based on a probation report saying she tested positive for controlled-substance use. The probation revocation hearing was set for October 22. When Holley asked the judge in court to hear her arguments for bail, he answered, ""Nope."" Holley returned to the Beverly Hills courthouse to meet with the prosecutor and the judge Friday afternoon, but Fox again refused to grant bail. Holley then filed her writ with Judge Schnegg just before 4 p.m., Parachini said. The actress showed no emotion as deputies handcuffed her hands behind her back and walked her out of the Beverly Hills courtroom Friday morning. Her father, who watched the short hearing from the rear of the courtroom, showed his own anger outside after his daughter was taken away. ""It's a horrible situation. I just hope the judge remands Lindsay to a rehab for a longer period of time and the people in Lindsay's life that are destroying her life and leading her down the wrong path are weeded out,"" Michael Lohan said. He singled out Holley for giving his daughter poor advice. Lohan cited his daughter's court-approved trip to New York during Fashion Week, saying she stayed alone in a hotel room, which opened her up to bad influences. Lohan's supervised probation for a 2007 drunken driving conviction requires frequent drug tests. The judge warned her last month that any failure could send her back to jail. ""Regrettably, I did in fact fail my most recent drug test and if I am asked, I am prepared to appear before judge Fox next week as a result,"" Lohan tweeted on September 17. She spent 23 days in a court-ordered drug rehab program last month, which followed a 13-day jail stint imposed when a Los Angeles judge ruled that Lohan violated her probation. Fox, who took over Lohan's case when she was released, imposed a new set of rules for her to follow until November. It included weekly counseling sessions for alcohol and drug rehabilitation, random drug tests and behavioral therapy. ""Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away overnight,"" Lohan tweeted. ""I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps."" Lohan tweeted that she was ""doing what I must do to prevent any mishaps in the future."" ""This was certainly a setback for me, but I am taking responsibility for my actions and I'm prepared to face the consequences,"" she tweeted. Lohan made fun of her substance abuse troubles in a backstage skit broadcast during the MTV Video Music Awards earlier in September. She appeared with show host Chelsea Handler, who was wearing an alcohol-detection bracelet like the one Lohan recently wore. ""Wake up, Handler; pull it together,"" Lohan said as she slammed Handler against a wall. ""You're a menace. Do you think anyone will work with a drunk? Take it from me, they don't."" Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident, she was charged with cocaine possession. The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later, when she played identical twins in Disney's remake of ""The Parent Trap.""","NEW: Another judge overrules Lohan's no-bail order .

"Washington (CNN) -- On the surface, the type of heated exchanges that boiled over at a congressional hearing on Monday on immigration reform appeared to center on the two foreign-born suspects in last week's Boston Marathon bombings. Beneath the surface, however, simmered tensions over the depth, breadth and pacing of plans to overhaul U.S. immigration policy currently wending through the Senate. ""Last week, opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the Boston Marathon bombing. ... I urge restraint in that regard,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said at the beginning of Monday's hearing. ""Refugees and asylum-seekers have enriched the fabric of this country from our founding."" Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, was one of the first conservatives to publicly connect the bombings to the roiling immigration debate and question whether the attacks would suggest a need to slow down and re-examine immigration reform efforts. He took exception to suggestions that he and others are trying to ""exploit"" the bombing for political purposes. ""I don't hear any criticism ... when there (were) 14 people killed in West,Texas, and (some political activists took) advantage of that tragedy to warn about more government action to make sure that fertilizer factories are safe,"" Grassley said. Boston terror fears raised at Senate immigration hearing . Both sides in the contentious immigration debate accuse the other of cynicism and using a national tragedy to score political points. The back and forth focuses on Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, brothers of northern Caucasus origin who lived legally in the United States. Investigators believe the pair were behind the attacks near last Monday's Boston Marathon finish line that killed three people and injured more than 170 others. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, immigrated to the United States with his parents in 2002 and became a U.S. citizen in 2012. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, followed a few years later and was a legal resident. Supporters of the bipartisan immigration measure authored by the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" accuse the other side of using any excuse, including using the Boston bombings, to stoke nationalistic sentiments as a way to derail the bill. Political rhetoric finds its way into post-bombing debate . New York Democrat Sen. Charles Schumer, one of the ""Gang of Eight"" senators who drafted the immigration plan, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" some on the right who opposed the bill ""from the get-go"" are simply using Boston ""as an excuse"" to stall the legislation. Opponents assert that the measure's supporters are rushing through immigration reform legislation. Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that Congress should wait until the emotional reaction to the violence subsides before tackling immigration legislation. Other lawmakers such as Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas and Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa have made similar assertion. Immigration reformers seek to avoid deja vu . Immigration law experts say they can see little merit to attempts to connect the Boston Marathon bombings to current immigration reform efforts. ""What I do see is the opponents of immigration reform who have no arguments about the morality and politics of (this immigration package) very cynically jumping on this horrible tragedy to derail this bill,"" said David Leopold, an immigration attorney and past president of the Washington-based American Immigration Lawyers Association. However, others caution that the current immigration reform measure has ""fundamental problems"" and applaud efforts to slow the pace of legislation. ""The bill is 132,000 words. The New Testament is 180,000 words. This isn't quite as long but it's going to take a little time to go through,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research for the non-profit Center for Immigration Studies. Immigration reformers seek to avoid deja vu . CNN's Tom Cohen and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","The Boston Marathon bombings are influencing the immigration reform debate .

"(CNN) -- ESPN ""SportsCenter"" host Hannah Storm suffered severe burns as the result of a propane grill accident at her Connecticut home on December 11.

I was the best person off in that burn unit. What many or so many suffer from is so exponentially worse than I could ever imagine. I'm so grateful to be able to do my job, to sit here and to talk to you and to be able to carry on. So the only reason that I will have wanted to share what I have wanted is because I don't want it to happen to anybody else, and I also want people to you know understand a little bit about what burn victims go through. The pain is there for a long time; the trauma is there for a long time. I think it's not always obvious. CNN: When the doctor came in and finally told you all the burns and the types of things that had happened, do you remember how they described to you what had happened? They said, ""You have first-degree burns on your hand and your neck."" The neck, you could actually see the flame -- it was like a flame shape, going up the neck. CNN: What was the treatment at that time, initially? Storm: I had to have a silver patch. It was a huge silver patch, so I was all ... patched up from like here to here. My hands were bandaged. But the body is ... incredible. You know, what it can do. I don't think people realize how exhausting it is when -- it's that pervasive feeling of exhaustion when you're recovering from burns. It's something that's still really surprising to me, because I still feel that way. You're just so incredibly tired, and then you're just ... you are so sore and then even now ... my chest is hot and my hands ... you feel that heat, and you feel the pins-and-needles feeling, you know, and you feel sensitive. You almost still feel it. It's really strange. CNN: Medical care here, how was it? Because again, these are significant injuries but if they're treated well or early ... Storm: Every burn has its own personality. It goes in its own direction. This hand got swollen and got infected. Infection is your No. 1 enemy with burns. ... This then got a fungal infection. So this hand really went through the wringer and was pretty ... double the size and really, you know, monstrous looking. Every burn on my body has had its own different personality. And all of them needed different things. So I got this cream (that) went here, and this hand needed this, and this hand needed that. My youngest daughter, Riley, because there were so many different lotions and types of bandages and wraps ... she actually took sticky notes and organized everything. Just taking care of that and taking care of the wounds was pretty much all I could do. It was so time-consuming. CNN: Is it hard for you to just be by that grill where this all happened, psychologically? Storm: I haven't really gone to the grill. It's the first time I've been out there. I won't cook on that grill. Maybe that seems silly, and maybe that's just today, but it was ... a terrible, traumatic, frightening event. And I don't want to be -- I don't like being afraid. I believe in tackling things you're afraid of. But I think it will be a very long time before I grill on that type of grill again. You know, I was in a hurry. That's when a lot of accidents happen. You're hurried, you're distracted, you're rushing, and that's a big personal lesson for me is, slow down. Sportscasting pioneer returns to TV after serious burns . CNN: I hope that a lot of people are listening, because I have to say, guilty, you know, I've probably been in that same position before. Storm: And also ... how many people are drinking beers and grilling, just talking, you know how many little kids are wandering about around the grill and you know, it's like a lot of things. It can very safe, and it can be very useful, and it can be a healthy way to cook. All of those things ... can also be dangerous if you don't do it properly and use it properly. CNN: Let me ask you a couple of specific questions with regard to burns. Sometimes, people can develop a pigmentation, some excessive and some not enough. Is that something your doctor spoke about? Storm: Yes. I can't go in the sun at all for six months. And there are some pretty significant pigmentation dangers with permanent pigmentation issues to my face and to my neck. Obviously, I've got potentially really big issues on the horizon there with my chest and my hands. CNN: Hot/cold sensitivity? Is that something that came up? Storm: Yes. Hot and cold and just the temperature. I know that when I've gone to work, that even the lights in the studio ... all of a sudden, that can bring on like a really serious heat flash, like change your body temperature, and at times you also get really, really cold ... inability to regulate your own body temperature. CNN: Obviously, the concern when you're working and you're at outside events, has that happened to you? Storm: Well, you know, the Super Bowl is outside, so I'm going to have to be really, really, really careful. I'm going to be in direct sunlight, so I'm worried about that. In the studio, we read our copy off a teleprompter, and I have had vision change since the accident so the corneas are singed. ... I had all my prescriptions changed. They have to move the cameras closer and change the type that we read in the teleprompter. CNN: But you're able to -- you're making it work. Do you think you're over the worst of it now? Storm: Physically, I think that the discomfort and the fatigue is still there. ... This is my big thing for the day, talking to you, you know. Whereas normally this would have been a part of an extraordinarily busy day. And so, you know, being a mom, being an anchor, having a production company, running a foundation ... I'm one of those go, go, go, go ... people, and I'm just going to put one ""go."" ... Just go and proceed with caution and attention to what you're doing instead of the crazy rush.

"(EW.com) -- There have been so many shrill, dumb, rinky-dink romantic comedies that it's easy to feel downright grateful when a smart, non-cheesy one comes along. ""Admission,"" a likable breezy campus movie directed by Paul Weitz (""About a Boy""), is blissfully non-insulting. The film is set at Princeton University, and Karen Croner's screenplay, which is based on Jean Hanff Korelitz's novel, crackles with the sound of very clever people trying to out-talk each other — an all too rare and happy thing to encounter in a Hollywood movie. Box office preview: 'The Croods' will oust 'Oz' from top spot . Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) is one of Princeton's elite team of admissions officers. She has the job of helping to choose which of the college's more than 26,000 yearly applicants, all of whom believe they deserve a place in the Princeton pantheon, are going to get in. (Approximate acceptance ratio: 1 in 26.) In this academic seller's market, Portia holds the power. But so much is riding on her decisions that the pressure of sorting through all those high school seniors, with their hilariously overstuffed extracurricular résumés (and their even more obsessive parents), has strung her tight. Fey's sweet-and-sour line readings at first sound like Liz Lemon redux, and I was glad for the moment when her 10-year relationship with a twit of an English professor (Michael Sheen, who also played one of Liz's disastrous boyfriends on ""30 Rock"") crashes and burns. The breakup unhinges Fey's character, and liberates her performance. From that point on, she's falling apart — or at least falling into a pit of desperation — and the neurotic crack-up looks good on her. It gives almost everything she does a shimmer of spontaneity. John Pressman (Paul Rudd), a teacher at a woodsy alternative New Hampshire high school called New Quest, is Portia's opposite: a do-gooding globe-trotter who believes in the kind of excellence that can't always be measured by grades or ''official'' achievement. 'Admission' star Nat Wolff applied early-decision for stardom . He's pushing one of his students for admission to Princeton; the kid, Jeremiah (Nat Wolff), is a prodigy with a troubled background, and John and Portia begin to tussle over his future from the moment they meet. John thinks that Jeremiah may be Portia's son, and the battle, as far as it goes, is lively. But then, just about every character in ""Admission"" has an enjoyably feisty intellectual attitude, from the wily dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn, for once not used as a walking punchline, and all the better for it), to Portia's switchblade-sharp office rival (Gloria Reuben), to the precocious students at John's school who question Portia about Princeton being a ''corporation'' devoted to the status quo. That Portia answers their gripe every bit as tartly demonstrates that the movie holds its traditional-versus-free-thinking priorities in a nice yin-and-yang balance. ""Admission"" has a promising first half, and the movie springs a real wild card in Lily Tomlin's brashly cutting and funny turn as Portia's mother, who wears her die-hard '70s feminism like a suit of burlap armor. Tomlin totally lets go. Her performance is an inspired satire of boomer self-righteousness and, at the same time, an unapologetic celebration of it. Line by line, ""Admission"" is often fresh, yet it's also one of those films that are so diagrammed that a soggy predictability begins to settle in. For a while, Fey and Rudd spark each other, but the bantering flirtation loses heat. I think that's because Portia, as written, has a genuine edge to her, whereas Rudd, with his smiley sincerity, is stuck playing too nice and flawless a guy. John would have been a more logical romantic foil if he'd had a pesky, holier-than-thou side. Kate Winslet confirmed for role in 'Divergent' Even with this soft-boiled romance at its center, ""Admission"" really is a movie about whether Jeremiah, with his lowly grade-point average and astonishing AP test scores, is going to get into Princeton. And here, I'm afraid, the film's values are a bit out of whack. It makes us pine for that ideal of Ivy League opportunity, a dream that it hangs on the issue of Jeremiah's admission. But what if he didn't get in? Surely he could go to some other good college. (He would seem perfect for Oberlin.) For a movie that's out to tweak the control-freak nature of the college-application process, ""Admission,"" in the end, bows down far too slavishly to it. It confuses achievement with acceptance.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A third man in China has died from the H7N9 virus, a strain of avian flu not previously detected in humans, the Zhejiang provincial department of health said Wednesday, according to state-run media outlet Xinhua. The disclosure of the third death comes only days after Chinese authorities announced the first three known cases of humans infected with the H7N9 bird flu virus on Sunday. The total number of people infected with H7N9 in China has risen to nine, Xinhua reported Wednesday. The death reported Wednesday was that of a 38-year-old man who passed away on March 27 in his home province of Zhejiang in eastern China, Xinhua reported. He worked in nearby Jiangsu province, where at least four other cases of humans infected with H7N9 were reported Tuesday. Two other people who died -- men aged 27 and 87 -- lived in nearby Shanghai, according to Xinhua. The World Health Organization confirmed those deaths Monday. Chinese authorities are trying to find the source of the human infections. They have so far said there are no signs of transmission of the H7N9 virus between any of the victims or people they have come into close contact with, suggesting the virus isn't highly contagious among humans. They have also dismissed suggestions linking the infections with the discovery of thousands of pig carcasses from the Huangpu River which runs through Shanghai. The Shanghai Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center on Monday tested 34 samples of pig carcasses pulled from the river and found no bird flu viruses, Xinhua reported. On Tuesday, the Jiangsu provincial health bureau reported four cases of H7N9 in humans: a 45-year-old woman from Nanjing, a 48-year-old woman from Suqian, an 83-year-old man from Suzhou, and a 32-year-old woman from Wuxi. The Nanjing woman worked culling poultry, it said. Malik Peiris, a professor at Hong Kong University's School of Public Health, said Monday that the H7N9 strain of avian flu, already known to exist in wild birds, had probably been transmitted to poultry, and it infected the humans. ""It's really important to understand where this virus is coming from,"" he said. Authorities in Shanghai are gathering daily data on cases of pneumonia resulting from unknown causes and will set up a team of experts to assess the ""severity and risk"" of H7N9, Xinhua reported Tuesday. Since the transmission of these types of viruses from animals to humans is usually ""extremely inefficient,"" there are often tens of thousands of infected birds for every human case, according to Peiris. As a result, ""it is very likely that there is a quite widespread outbreak happening"" among the animals from which it came, he said, underscoring the urgent need to track down the source. The World Health Organization said Monday it was ""in contact with the national authorities and is following the event closely."" Because there are so few cases of H7N9 detected so far, little research has been done, according to Xinhua. There are no known vaccines against this virus, it said. But Peiris said it was likely that existing anti-flu drugs, such as Tamiflu, are likely to work against the H7N9 strain. He also noted that the WHO has identified the H7 virus family as a potential threat and earmarked possible vaccine candidates. He said other strains from the H7 family had caused previous outbreaks in poultry in countries including the Netherlands, Britain, Canada, the United States and Mexico. Human infection was documented in all of those cases except the Mexican one. The outbreak of the H7N7 strain in the Netherlands in 2003 infected 89 people, one of whom died, according to Peiris. The better known H5N1 avian flu virus has infected more than 600 people since 2003, of which 371 have died, according to the WHO. In February, China reported two new human cases of H5N1 in the southern province of Guizhou, both of whom were in a critical condition, the WHO said. A spike in H5N1 deaths, many of them children, has been reported in Cambodia, prompting concern among health authorities. READ MORE: 2 dead in China from unusual bird flu strain .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The consequences of ordering the military to crack down on anti-government demonstrations more than two years ago has come back to haunt the former Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. Thai authorities have charged Abhisit and his former deputy with murder in relation to the killing of Pan Kumkong, a taxi driver, amid the unrest that brought chaos to the streets of the capital city, Bangkok, in 2010. The Department of Special Investigation (DSI) said Thursday that the charges against Abhisit and Suthep Thaungsuban concern orders to soldiers to use live ammunition in the area were Pan was shot. If convicted, they would face the punishment of death or life in prison. The Court of Justice ruled in September that the taxi driver's death resulted from acts carried out by the military under instructions from the Center for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation, a temporary task force set up by Abhisit. He and Suthep have been summoned to hear the charges on Wednesday, said Thairt Pengdit, director general of the DSI. Political tensions erupted in early 2010 with protesters demanding that Abhisit step down. He resisted the calls, and clashes between his supporters and those of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup, turned violent. Abhisit sent in government troops to quell the long-running protests in Bangkok. More than 90 people died and hundreds were injured in the street battles that followed, one of the bloodiest episodes in recent Thai history. In July 2011, Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was elected as prime minister, defeating Abhisit.","Abhisit Vejjajiva and his former deputy are charged over the death of a taxi driver .

"(CNN) -- Ray Lewis had to wait a half hour, but the Raven got the swan song he wanted. The renowned linebacker, considered by many to be one of the greatest to ever play the game, went out a winner, as the Baltimore Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in a Super Bowl delayed by a third-quarter power outage. ""What better way to go out,"" Lewis said after the Sunday night win at the Superdome in New Orleans. ""The things that we have been through all year, we were battle tested through this journey, the up and down roller coaster, the injuries, the passings of people. We stayed together, and now I get to ride off into the sunset with my second ring."" The Ravens took a 22-point lead before the 49ers rallied after a 35-minute delay for a power failure. San Francisco got within two points, but Baltimore held on. ""We talk to our guys all the time, it's never very pretty, it's never perfect but it is us,"" Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said. It is the second victory in the NFL championship for the Ravens, who also won Super Bowl XXXV. It was also a bitter sweet one for coach John Harbaugh. His younger brother, Jim, is the 49ers' coach. Lights go out . About 90 second into the third quarter and with the Ravens leading 28-6, the power in about half of the Superdome went out. The referee called a halt to the game, while stadium officials worked to fix the problem. Players sat on the field, stretching or talking to one another. Spectators -- and there were 71,024 in attendance -- mostly stayead in their seats. About 35 minutes later -- and with the cause of the outage not fully known -- the game resumed. The break in play appeared to help the 49ers, who scored three times in just over four minutes. Michael Crabtree scored on a 31-yard touchdown throw from Colin Kaepernick and Frank Gore scored on a six-yard run. David Akers kicked his third field goal of the contest as the 49ers scored the first 17 points after the near blackout. ""I felt our guys battled, they competed,"" losing coach Jim Harbaugh said. ""We got a spark, and we weren't going to look back. It was a heck of a football game."" 'Heck of a football game' After Ravens rookie Justin Tucker kicked a field goal, Kaepenick scored on a 15-yard scamper -- the longest touchdown run by a quarterback in Super Bowl history. The 49ers went for a two-point conversion that would have tied the score, but Kaepernick threw too high. Another Tucker field goal made it 34-29 Ravens before the 49ers had their final shot. The 49ers drove to the Ravens' five-yard line but Kaepernick's lofted pass to Crabtree sailed out of bounds with 1:49 remaining. Jim Harbaugh pleaded with the officials to call a holding penalty on the Ravens' defensive back, but there was no flag. After running three plays, the Ravens took a safety with four seconds left in the game instead of punting out of their end zone. The 49ers ran out of time as they returned the game-ending free kick. Ravens' quarterback Joe Flacco -- who was selected as the game's most valuable player -- was 22 of 33 for 287 yards. Kaepernick was 16 of 28 for 246 yards. Flacco threw red-zone touchdown passes in the first half -- the first to Anquan Boldin and another to Dennis Pitta. He also hit Jones for a 56-yard touchdown pass, where the wide-open receiver fell down catching the ball at the 8-yard line, got up and evaded one defender before sprinting into the end zone. Baltimoreans rejoice . Late Sunday night, euphoric Baltimore residents spilled into the streets, dancing and waving flags. Many darted in between cars, which in turn honked their horns and joined in the celebrations. ""I think it's a very exciting time for us,"" City Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told CNN. He said his officers were keeping an eye but were letting residents enjoy themselves. ""We have a number of residents that are out doing celebratory jumping in the street, which is normal and expected."" Back in New Orleans, the Harbaugh brothers met at midfield after the game. ""I told him I was proud of him"" Jim Harbaugh said. ""I think he said the same.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is moving toward increasing aid to the Syrian opposition, including providing nonlethal military equipment and possibly strategic military training, sources told CNN Tuesday. The changes are under discussion with allies as well, as part Secretary of State John Kerry's meetings this week in Europe, a senior administration official said. The sources said the United States is not considering providing weapons. The administration is also moving toward giving humanitarian aid directly to the Syrian Opposition Coalition, the official said, adding that this was already happening in limited amounts. Obama's national security policy resembles Eisenhower's . The consideration was first reported on Tuesday by The Washington Post. The United States is also looking to remove restrictions on ""dual-use"" equipment, such as those involving communications, body armor, flak jackets, night-vision equipment and military vehicles, according to another source familiar with the policy discussions. Such items are defensive in nature, but they could be used to aid in combat. The training would be intended to help rebels allocate resources and set objectives, strategize and possibly train a potential police force, the source said. ""They are doing a redefinition of what is lethal,"" the source said. ""They have been working on this for a while."" The source said the United States is also helping the new Syrian government in exile get on its feet by developing government institutions, strategic communications and outreach. The increase is being done in coordination with the Europeans. A senior European diplomat said that though the European Union is not lifting its arms embargo against Syria, its members are moving to loosen restrictions on nonlethal military aid -- including night-vision goggles, body armor and possible military training. Each EU nation would decide on its own what to supply, the official said. Reversing course, Syrian opposition group to attend Rome conference . In meetings on his first official trip, Kerry has focused on Syria. He met Tuesday with German officials and with Russia's foreign minister. Their two-hour discussion included Syria, said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. On Thursday, Kerry travels to Rome for a meeting of countries supporting the opposition. Kerry was involved in an effort to keep the Syrian opposition -- upset by the government's attacks on Aleppo and a perceived lack of movement by other countries to prevent it -- from following through on an announced boycott of the Rome meeting. The U.S. ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, flew Sunday to Cairo to talk to the opposition and Kerry spoke Monday by phone with the group. By Monday evening, the group announced it would attend Thursday's meetings. ""We are determined that the Syrian opposition is not going to be dangling in the wind wondering where the support is or if it is coming, and we are determined to change the calculation on the ground for President (Bashar al-Assad),"" Kerrry said Monday in London. Until recently, the loosely coordinated rebel movement was heavily outgunned by al-Assad's military forces, who leveraged superior weaponry and an air force. But rebels have made significant gains recently. As foreign countries have funneled more weapons to the opposition, rebels have seized control of greater territory, and the fighting has moved closer to the capital of Damascus, according to opposition fighters. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia was supplying the rebels with Croatian weapons funneled through Jordan. ""Indeed, we procured new anti-aircraft and heavy defensive weapons donated from Arab and non-Arab countries recently,"" Louay Almokdad, political and media coordinator for the Free Syrian Army, told CNN on Sunday. ""But they are not enough to stand against the regime's forces at this point."" French journalist killed while covering Syrian civil war .

"(CNN) -- In the cold, predawn hours of February 20, 2007, shortly after 4 a.m., armed men stormed into the home I owned with my family and burst into my bedroom, shouting at me to show my hands. My husband had left for work, and our 4-year-old son began to cry with fright. I stumbled out of bed in my nightclothes to the family living area, terrified and confused. Two armed men were coming upstairs from our basement, having searched it without permission, and others were demanding that we tell them the location of my ex-husband, with whom I had not lived for several years. As I had reported to the immigration service on my daughters' citizenship applications, I had been remarried for four years. The men acted as if they had the right to be in our home, but we knew to ask questions: Who were they? Did they have a warrant? They refused to identify themselves or show a warrant, and they put their hands on their guns when we tried to move. They interrogated my 12-year-old daughter and ordered my brother, a U.S. citizen since he was a teenager, to produce his papers. That's when I realized the men were U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. When they left, they threatened to return. The same scene was happening all over New York: Armed agents surrounding homes, pounding on doors and windows, ordering residents to open the door and storming in, sometimes damaging doors and walls, sometimes pointing guns as they entered. It didn't seem to matter to the agents whether they found the person they were looking for or if frightened people in the home could not produce papers. The agents arrested people even if they hadn't been a target. The ICE agents had no judicial warrants; instead, they claimed that the rudely awakened men, women and sometimes children in the homes had provided consent. We decided to sue and discovered that ICE had embarked on a nationwide program of warrantless immigration sweeps with names such as ""Return to Sender"" and ""Community Shield"" to invade private homes in search of undocumented immigrants. Last week, more than six years and many court battles later, our class-action suit Aguilar v ICE, which included 22 New York men, women and children, was settled in Federal District Court for a million dollars. ICE has also been required to change national training and policy to conform with existing law to avoid further abuses from home raids. We are proud of this accomplishment, even though we know that home raid operations have continued in the Obama era, most notably in Tennessee and Alabama, where Latinos report ICE engaging in the very same unconstitutional behavior that traumatized my family. During those raids in 2006 and 2007, thousands of terrified people, mostly Latino, were pulled out of bed. ICE claimed it was looking for people not suspected of a crime, but merely those in violation of civil immigration laws. Although ICE was supposedly seeking fugitives -- people who may have evaded a deportation order -- most of the people they arrested had never had any encounter with the agency before. They were arrested because many ICE agents were operating under a quota policy that gave credit for arrests of any undocumented person, not just the target. Citizens and lawful permanent residents like us were not immune; if ICE had an old address for someone they were looking for, that address was fair game. In the home of three of the other people in our case, ICE knew it had already deported the person it were seeking. But agents invaded anyway, storming inside after a 12-year-old girl opened the door in her pajamas. ICE invaded the home of another family in our case twice in little more than a year, because when agents didn't find their target the first time, they didn't bother to record the mistake. It seemed that being Latino, and nothing more, was enough to arouse suspicion. ICE declined to enter the homes of white residents who opened their doors in shock. Latino men and women were handcuffed before they were even asked about their status, and some agents even admitted to using the derogatory word ""wet"" to describe the Latinos they encountered. I studied the U.S. Constitution in order to naturalize. I knew that the government is not supposed to enter your home without a warrant or handcuff you only because you are Latino. But that night in 2007, and in the months after, I lost a sense of hope in our government's ability to make its own agents obey the law. The fact that ICE has agreed to some changes helps me regain that hope. As the country debates immigration reform and enforcement, we owe it to ourselves to hold ICE's leaders and agents accountable and to make sure that they are subject to the same laws as everyone else. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the writers.","Class-action suit brought by Adriana Leon requires ICE to change policy on home raids .

"(CNN) -- At times it was almost painful to watch. At one end of the court the world's No. 1 female tennis star playing well within herself; at the other her sister, a long way away from regaining that form and status. ""Venus has had a great week, and honestly, if she hadn't had to play so many matches, it would have been a much tougher match,"" Serena Williams said after comfortably beating her older sibling on Saturday to reach the final of the Family Circle Cup in Charleston. The 31-year-old was slightly overstating the rigors of the competition in South Carolina, a tournament that heralded the formation of the women's tour back in 1973 but has this week attracted just two of the world's top-10 players. Serena is one, and the other -- 10th-ranked Caroline Wozniacki -- crashed out in the quarterfinals on Friday against Swiss No. 63 Stefanie Vogele. Both Williams sisters won two matches on Friday to set up their first meeting since 2009, but it was defending champion Serena who looked the least affected as she won 6-1 6-2 in just 54 minutes. ""She'll never admit it, but I don't think she was 100%,"" Serena said of her sister, who was diagnosed with a debilitating autoimmune disease before the 2011 U.S. Open -- a grand slam she has won twice, along with her five Wimbledons. ""But you will never get that out of her. And quite frankly, three matches for her is much tougher than three matches for me. It's definitely not easy -- because I'm struggling, and I can't imagine what she must be feeling."" Venus, seeded fifth this week and ranked 24th, brushed off suggestions that her health issues had hindered her. ""I felt pretty good actually -- it would have been nicer to have more space between the matches, but it did not work out,"" the 32-year-old American said. ""But I played under the same circumstances as everyone else, at least in the top half of the draw. ""I had a chance to win the match. We both had rackets. But I didn't take advantage of my chances. I was controlling the points, but then I would miss. ""I have to improve my game. I have to get in these situations more often.

"(CNN) -- In a matter of days, my phone will start talking back. Given that I already have what you might call a ""co-dependent"" relationship with my gadgets, this development is perhaps the next natural step. Yet I know that phones are phones, and people are people, and the two must never be confused. The iPhone 4S, which will make my old iPhone 4 obsolete when it launches this Friday, features the ability to hold voice conversations with its owner. The feature, named Siri Personal Assistant, means that your iPhone will respond to your voice commands -- ask it to find a nice restaurant, check your schedule or send a text message for you. You'll receive a courteous reply. What's more, your new iPhone not only speaks but also has a gender: Siri has a female voice. Ask Siri, ""Do I need a raincoat today?"" and she'll look up the weather for you, replying helpfully, ""It sure looks like rain today."" She's so generous, in fact, that she'll help you out before you even ask. Passively say, ""I'm in the mood for sushi,"" and Siri comes to your aid: ""I've found a number of sushi restaurants,"" she'll proclaim, adding in her characteristically specific fashion: ""22 of them are fairly close to you."" She's pretty much an expert on food, to be honest. Italian restaurants? Indian cuisine? Offer her dinner in any city, and she'll know the best places to go. She knows all your friends, of course, and remembers all their phone numbers. She knows all your favorite songs and offers to wake you up in the morning. She's adorably helpful like that. She has an amazing memory, too. Tell her about any upcoming event, and she'll remind you nearer to the time it's scheduled. That kind of dependability is hard to find these days. Not to mention, she's quite the philosopher. Her thoughts on the eternal question, ""What is the meaning of life?"" show her softer side: ""Try and be nice to people. Avoid eating fat."" She's keenly intelligent, too, adding as an afterthought, ""Read a good book every now and then."" Did I mention she's great at directions? Go anywhere in the United States and ask her how to get home: She'll know. (Swoon!) And that's what's great about this new era of voice-enabled technology: We can converse with our phones, newly equipped with intonation and intuition, without ever forming a dependence on them. We can accept that their creators have imbued them with a dose of personality without ever thinking that they're actually people. We can converse more with our devices than we do with our spouses and yet never let our digital dialogues impinge on our human ones. This is a very bright future, and I'm sure these new advances will have no negative consequences at all. Siri assured me of it -- and she's right about everything.","The iPhone 4s features the ability to hold voice conversations with its owner .

"(CNN) -- The debates this presidential primary season have been less like Lincoln-Douglas than former heavyweight champ Buster Douglas -- punch-drunk pugilism, providing entertainment and some great upsets along the way. But for all the excitement of the fights, there is a civic cost to the radioactive rhetoric that gets thrown out to excite the conservative crowds. It's not just that the most irresponsible candidates can play to the base and get a boost in the polls, while more sober-minded candidates like Jon Huntsman fail to get attention. The real damage is to the process of running for president itself. Because when low blows get rewarded, the incentive to try to emulate Lincoln -- holding yourself to a higher standard -- is diminished. And one barometer of this atmospheric shift is in the increasingly overheated rhetoric by candidates attacking the current president. This serial disrespect ends up unintentionally diminishing the office of president itself. Look, I know that politics is a full-contact sport: Elbows get thrown and egos get bruised. But ask yourself if Ronald Reagan ever called Jimmy Carter a socialist or a communist on the stump. Sure, there were deep philosophical and policy disagreements between them, and Carter was called a failed president many times. But there was a lingering respect for the office that retained an essential bit of dignity. It was only the far-right fringe who indulged in the kind of rhetoric we now hear routinely from presidential candidates. For example, Newt Gingrich gained steam early in the primary process by accusing President Obama of having a ""Kenyan anti-Colonial mindset,"" and invoking the specter of a ""Obama's secular socialist machine."" As a highly compensated historian, Newt should have known better than to say that Obama is the ""most radical president in American history."" But then accuracy -- or even aiming in the general vicinity of the truth -- isn't the point. Rick Santorum raised eyebrows this past weekend for saying Obama wants to impose a ""phony theology"" on America. Santorum has since tried to clarify that he was not trying to raise doubts about the president's religion and I'll take him at his word. Likewise, when Santorum compares GOP primary voters to members of the ""greatest generation"" called to act against the rise of Nazi Germany, I'll assume that Santorum isn't intentionally comparing the president to Hitler. But a month ago, when a Santorum supporter accused Obama of being ""an avowed Muslim"" who ""constantly says that our Constitution is passÃ©"" and ""has no legal right to be calling himself president"" -- Santorum did nothing to correct her. Instead, he told CNN: ""I don't feel it's my obligation every time someone says something I don't agree with to contradict them."" But I think standing up for the truth in the face of unhinged hate is part of a potential president's job. So did John McCain. Four years ago, at the height of the general election, when a supporter called then-candidate Obama an ""Arab,"" McCain corrected her. He said, ""No, ma'am. He's a decent family man ... (a) citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues."" That's the voice of a loyal opposition, putting patriotism above partisanship. Even the sober-minded Mitt Romney has gotten into the hyper-partisan pandering game lately. Maybe he's trying to compensate for a lack of enthusiasm on the far-right with red meat rhetoric, but the effect is desperate. For example, when Mitt was barnstorming through Florida, a standard part of his stump speech was this: ""Sometimes I think we have a president who doesn't understand America."" This line was straight out of the ""Alien in the White House"" playbook, a riff that reinforced the worst impulses of some in the audience, as one woman at a Romney rally named Katheryn Sarka eagerly reaffirmed when I asked her what she thought of the line: ""Obama doesn't understand America. He follows George Soros. Obama is against our Constitution and our democracy."" After his big Nevada win, this line of Mitt's scripted victory speech stood out: ""President Obama demonizes and denigrates almost every sector of our economy."" Romney knows this isn't true, but he's been convinced that it works and he seems to be willing to say whatever it takes to make the sale. Here's what's most troubling about this trend: It doesn't seem remarkable anymore. For the candidates and many in the press, it is just the new normal, the cost of doing business. The overheated rhetoric simply reflects the conversation that's been going on at the grassroots for a long time. Like a frog in a slowly boiling pot of water, we don't realize that the heat is killing us until it is too late -- except that the casualty here is the quality of our civic debate and the bonds that are bigger than partisan politics. It's naÃ¯ve to think it will stop when Mr. Obama is no longer president, whether that is in one year or five. Because the next Republican president will inherit the political atmosphere that's been created and find that it is almost impossible to unite the nation absent a crisis. Some Democratic activists will no doubt take a tactical page from recent conservative successes. This cycle of incitement -- where extremes inflame and empower each other -- will make our politics more of an ideological bloodsport and less about actually solving problems. Perspective is the thing we have least of in our politics these days. But perspective is what the presidency is all about -- rising above divisions and distractions to make long-term decisions in the national interest. By pouring gasoline on an already inflammatory political environment, the GOP presidential candidates not only diminish themselves, they diminish the process of running for president, and make it less likely that they would succeed in uniting the nation if they actually won the office.

"(CNN) -- A legal chapter closes now that a federal judge has lifted an injunction on Arizona's ""show me your papers"" provision of its tough immigration law, but the legal combat won't end and will merely take a new direction, analysts and attorneys say. At the same time, implementation of the law will heighten a wary relationship between police who must enforce the law and Latinos who allege it will inevitably cause racial profiling. The court's demand for evidence of such profiling is prompting Latino advocates to police the police and monitor arrest practices. The controversial provision authorizes local police, while performing other state law enforcement duties, to check on the immigration status of people they stop for another reason. The federal judge in Arizona this week based her decision on a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding the provision, she said. Undocumented immigrants face arrest as they proclaim, 'No papers, no fear' Police monitoring and a public awareness campaign have already begun in the state's Hispanic communities, who make up most of the state's immigrants, advocates say. ""We're already doing it,"" said Isabel Garcia, co-chair of the Coalicion de Derechos Humanos, a civil and human rights group in Tucson that opposes the law. ""We formed a 'Yo Soy Testigo' -- 'I Am a Witness' -- hot line. We're getting so many calls now it's unbelievable,"" Garcia said. In the meantime, the stage is set for continued fighting between the state and federal governments over the administration of the law, as the Department of Homeland Security reiterated this week that it will only respond to immigration enforcement requests in priority cases, such as those involving convicted criminals. Additional legal wrangling could arise from executing U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton's ruling to terminate the injunction. Both sides have 10 days to agree on the wording of the order to lift the injunction, but they may disagree on how the provision should be carried out, said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, a party in the case that is challenging the law. MALDEF and co-counsels in the case have yet to decide whether to appeal the judge's ruling, Saenz said. Saenz is expecting a long legal slog, he said. ""There will certainly be other chapters,"" Saenz said. ""There will definitely be additional court skirmishes before Section 2b -- the show-your-papers provision -- takes effect. This is not a dead issue because of the possibility of appeal,"" Saenz said. Proving racial profiling is difficult, Saenz said. In a separate Arizona case, MALDEF and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona are now waiting for a federal judge's ruling after a trial of their class-action lawsuit against the Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his department, both of whom are accused of racial profiling and discrimination against Latinos. Arpaio denies any discrimination. Immigration lawsuit revives DREAM Act debate . ""What Arpaio is doing sort of previews what will likely happen statewide if the show-your-papers provision is implemented,"" Saenz said. Meanwhile, the number of federal immigration checks sought by local Arizona police continues to show an overall downward trend as it has for the past three years, said spokeswoman Amber Cargile of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Phoenix. ICE responds only to local police calls deemed in line with federal priorities, which are cases involving criminal aliens, threats to public safety, recent border crossers and illegal immigrants who have entered the country a second time, Cargile said. In June, 61 calls from local police agencies resulted in the arrest of 151 people on immigration violations; there were 35 calls and 86 arrests in July and 41 calls and 65 arrests in August, Cargile said. ""We are seeing a continued downward trend in numbers,"" Cargile said. ""This is consistent across the board over the past three years. Our drop house encounters in Phoenix are down considerably, and Border Patrol apprehensionsâ€”a key indicator of illegal immigrationâ€”have decreased significantly as well."" Once the injunction is officially lifted, the government of Arizona will have to decide when to begin enforcing the provision, said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. Arizona could choose to wait a period before implementing the provision to provide training or other guidance to its law enforcement, she said. Barring a call by opponents for an emergency ruling to maintain the injunction, it is just a matter of time before it goes into effect. Once it does, Meissner said, the strategy used by opponents of the law is expected to change. From the moment it begins to be enforced, opponents will be focused on monitoring its implementation, she said. That's where the next challenge is expected to come. In short, what Bolton's ruling said was that, given the Supreme Court ruling, the provision cannot be blocked on the speculation that it is discriminatory. There has to be evidence of racial profiling for the law to be blocked. ""You can't do it in the abstract. You need a person, or persons, who believe they have been discriminated against,"" Meissner said. Judge weighs Arizona immigration law . But those kinds of cases aren't easy to win, said Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy think tank. Trying to prove racial profiling in court can turn into a he-said, she-said affair between alleged victims and police, he said. ""There's a story to tell, and a counternarrative that police officers will tell,"" Fitz said. ""It's not impossible, but I think any litigator will tell you it is a steep hill to climb."" Implementation of the ""show me your papers"" provision will set off a potential multi-year process of litigators and activists collecting evidence to convince a court that systemic racial profiling exists. After this week's ruling, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer denied the law would discriminate. ""As I have said consistently, it is not enough that this law be enforced. It must be enforced efficiently, effectively and in harmony with the Constitution and civil rights. I have no doubt Arizona's law enforcement officers are up for the task ahead,"" she said. The law that supporters envisioned, however, may not produce the results they wanted, even in enforcement. The Obama administration has a policy to remove only certain groups of undocumented immigrants, such as convicted criminals. Even if Arizona police requests overwhelm ICE, the agency will not respond unless the subject meets its criteria, said Cargile. ""As we've previously emphasized, Department of Homeland Security officials in Arizona have been directed not to respond to requests from state and local police officers for assistance in enforcing immigration laws unless the individual or individuals in question meet DHS' enforcement priorities,"" she said. The department will continue to verify a person's immigration status upon request, however.

"(CNN) -- Kevin-Prince Boateng has urged football authorities to give referees ""all the power"" in the game's bid to stamp out racism on and off the pitch. The AC Milan star started something big when he walked off during a friendly match in January in protest at racist abuse from the crowd, and he told CNN he is determined to help bring in even stronger sanctions to combat one of the game's biggest problems. ""I would give all the power to the referees,"" he said Friday before meeting with the head of football's governing body to discuss issues of discrimination. ""I would even go so far to say, even if you hear a little bit, and you hear it again, stop the game -- because that's the only way I think you can make these voices silent. That's the only way. ""Even maybe put people in the stadium, maybe sit some people in the crowd so that they can hear and see maybe that it's racial or that it's very aggressive ... and tell (the match officials) what they heard."" After the meeting with Sepp Blatter in Zurich, FIFA announced that Boateng has been invited to become part of its task force against racism and discrimination. The other members have yet to be named, but Boateng hopes they will be able to lay down strong guidelines to deter racist behavior. ""I hope they are going to wake up tomorrow morning and say, 'Today -- even more.' And, the next day wake up and say we fight even more against it,"" said Boateng, who on Thursday gave a speech at a United Nations conference in Geneva discussing racism and sport. ""In this moment now we are speaking about it, but to wake up tomorrow morning and do something about it, that's a different thing. ""Things will change, I'm very positive about that. We can see the changes already. There are going to be more sanctions -- harder -- and I think this is the right way, I'm looking forward to that."" The 26-year-old is still coming to terms with the impact of his actions in January, when his teammates followed him off the pitch. It not only ended the match against Italian fourth division team Pro Patria, but it also sparked worldwide debate about whether it was the right thing to do. ""At the end, after not even 10 minutes, I had like 86 phone calls on my phone and I thought something had happened, but it was just an unbelievable impact. It went all around the world within the first hour,"" Boateng said. ""People were calling me, my agent was calling me, my family members, and I was like, what did I do? Because for me it was just a situation, I felt I needed to do that -- I was angry and a bit disappointed. But it was just unbelievable how it spread around the world."" Boateng reiterated his stance that he would do the same again, if it was a top-level European match or even the World Cup final. ""I think we should not accept and tolerate it anywhere, or any game, whether it's a friendly game or a World Cup final. If I feel this is racial abuse I would even do it in a Champions League final. ""Then of course it's a different situation, there's a lot of money involved. Would my teammates all follow me? I don't know because it's a totally different situation, but for my part I would do the same."" Boateng admitted that when he was younger he had ""ignored"" racist abuse, but now as a father he is determined to make a difference. ""I have a little son -- I'm taking care of these things because I want my son to grow up in a nice place and not in a place where he has to be confronted by racism,"" he said. Boateng grew up in Berlin and represented Germany at youth level, but switched allegiances to Ghana -- where his father was born. He said earlier in his career he had no faith the football authorities would take effective steps against racism, but has recently been impressed with sanctions -- such as Greek club AEK Athens banning one of its promising young players who made a fascist salute. ""I thought it's never going to change, maybe they will not ever do enough to fight against it. But now the most recent example we saw of it, I think they are doing much, much better -- that players get banned for playing forever for a club or teams playing without the supporters. ""I think that is the right direction we have to move forward like that and I think then the people will understand.""","AC Milan player invited to become part of FIFA's anti-discrimination task force .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- An airstrike Saturday hit a parking lot outside the compound in central Tripoli of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, killing three people, a government spokesman said. Musa Ibrahim said he had no information about the identities of the dead in the attack on the compound, called Bab el-Azizia. The attack, presumably from NATO forces, came shortly after Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Khaim announced that Libya's army will withdraw from the besieged coastal city of Misrata and allow tribal leaders to attempt to deal with the rebels. ""The situation in Misrata will be eased and will be dealt with by the tribes surrounding Misrata,"" Khaim told reporters. ""You will see how they will be swift and quick and fast."" He added that the residents of Libya's third-largest city have been in the grip of the conflict. ""The tactic of the Libyan army is to have a surgical solution, but it doesn't work,"" Khaim said. ""With the airstrikes, it does not work. We will leave it for the tribes and Misrata people to deal with the situation -- either to use force or negotiations."" He added, ""The tribal leaders have issued an ultimatum to the military saying they will deal with the situation if the military cannot do it. ... They will speak with the rebels and, if there is no solution, they will fight the rebels."" In the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, in the east, rebel spokesman Ahmed Bani reacted to Khaim's comments with laughter and derision. ""This only confirms that he wants to save face,"" Bani said of Gadhafi. ""This confirms that our rebels in Misrata have liberated Misrata and that Libya is still in one piece, not two, the way Gadhafi hoped. In regards to the tribes fighting the rebels; how would you believe that a person will fight his brother? And who are the tribes that are supporting Gadhafi, anyway?"" He predicted that if Gadhafi forces leave Misrata, ""it will mean that this game is over."" But he added that he did not necessarily believe they will. Earlier Friday, Bani said that Libyan rebels had wrested control of a key building in Misrata and made other advances in the city. ""This victory is quite important for us, and it shows that we are advancing and we are heading in the right direction,"" Bani told CNN about the rebels' control of the National Insurance Building, which is on the main thoroughfare, Tripoli Street. Its height provided snipers with a clear view of surrounding streets. Bani said some fighters loyal to Gadhafi were negotiating to surrender their weapons to the rebels in exchange for the rebels' assurances that they would not be harmed. But the carnage of recent days was on display at the city's hospitals, where doctors were working long hours and beds were full. Gadhafi's forces retain control of roads that lead to the seacoast city. But access by sea remains open, and on Friday another aid ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration left Benghazi for Misrata carrying food, medicine and other supplies. The organization said it hopes to rescue more casualties and stranded migrants from the city. ""Given the increasing number of casualties in Misrata and the thousands of lives that are in danger, we felt a responsibility to act,"" said Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore of Ireland, which is helping fund the chartered vessels. ""Colonel Gadhafi's forces have agreed to allow ships into the port to evacuate civilians and we have requested that the IOM undertake an emergency operation on our behalf,"" Gilmore said. At a news conference in Baghdad, America's top military chief acknowledged a stalemate on Libya's eastern front, around the oil towns of Ajdabiya and al-Brega, both of which have changed hands several times. ""The regime forces have changed their tactics, and changed it in a way where they essentially look like the opposition forces, so it's become a much more difficult fight,"" U.S. Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters. ""And as I've observed in recent days, essentially it is very much stalemate-like in the vicinity of Ajdabiya and al-Brega,"" Mullen said. He said the outcome -- toppling Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of rule -- is certain. But the timing, he said, is ""difficult to predict."" Also Friday, Sen. John McCain made an unannounced visit to Benghazi, the rebel stronghold, where residents welcomed him. Some waved American flags, some chanted, ""Thank you John McCain! Thank you Obama! Thank you America! We need freedom! Gadhafi go away!"" The senator from Arizona's arrival came a day after the United States said it was deploying drones to Libya. McCain, a proponent of beefing up U.S. efforts to oust Gadhafi, said the drones will increase NATO's capability but not enough to break a ""significant degree of stalemate."" Though he opposes sending U.S. ground troops to Libya, he said the international community needs to ""facilitate"" weapons and training for the rebels. McCain, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Libya since the conflict erupted in February, challenged critics of intervention to tour Benghazi, as he did Friday, to see a ""powerful and hopeful example of what a free Libya can be."" The top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee stopped by a hospital and suggested that Western powers are not doing enough for the rebels. ""Let's face it: This is not a fair fight,"" said McCain, a decorated Vietnam veteran with clout in defense circles. ""Maybe we should be doing everything we can to help these people and maybe we're not, and they're dying."" U.S. Predator drones were deployed Thursday in the North African nation as part of the NATO-led military efforts there. But as of Friday night, the drones had made no strikes, said a Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Darryn James. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier that bad weather forced the deployed drones to return. Libya's deputy foreign minister told reporters that the decision reflects poorly on U.S. President Barack Obama. ""He is involving himself in a dirty game,"" Khaim said. ""This is will be another crime against humanity committed by the American administration and I feel very sad for President Obama to be involved in such a thing."" CNN's Reza Sayah, Saad Abedine, Frederik Pleitgen and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Airstrike hits parking lot outside Gadhafi's compound in central Tripoli .

"Tombstone, Arizona (CNN) -- The six Forest Service rangers suddenly crouched, whispering, on their way up the rocky mountain trail. It was early Friday afternoon, the first day of the Tombstone Shovel Brigade, and the rangers were out in force, hiking to the spot where dozens of volunteers worked with picks and shovels to move and bury Tombstone's makeshift water line. Shhh! Look! Do you see it? The rangers stopped in their tracks. Binoculars emerged from pockets, and fingers pointed to a stand of trees. And there it was, a Mexican spotted owl, perched high in a pine tree. It was a male, the rangers said, with his back turned to the intruders. He scratched and preened. But mostly, the owl seemed to be watching the nest in a nearby sycamore tree where his mate tended to an owlet. The owl is a threatened species, and until a few days ago its presence in fire-scorched Miller Canyon was a matter of speculation. But now that it has surfaced, the owl could be a game-changer in the water war between the U.S. Forest Service and the Wild West city made famous by the 30-second gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Tombstone is trying to repair a 26-mile pipeline that has brought mountain spring water into the city since 1881. It was damaged during last summer's Monument Fire and monsoon rains that brought mud, water and boulders crashing down the denuded slopes. The Miller Peak Wilderness Area, where owls nest in the trees above Tombstone's pipeline, was hit particularly hard. Sections of pipeline simply vanished, and Tombstone's reservoir ran dry by August. Kevin Rudd, project manager for the Tombstone pipeline, said the repaired pipeline needs to be shored up or it surely will be washed away when the monsoon rains return next month. Planned tasks for the shovel brigade include reinforcing the spring and diverting its flow by using boulders, sand, downed trees and other flood debris. As for the owl, nobody could say for certain after the fire whether it would return. But it's the big reason why the Forest Service wouldn't simply hand Tombstone a permit to use heavy construction equipment to fix the pipeline. Tombstone responded by taking the feds to court. Since then, the conflict has escalated, taking on a life of its own. Tombstone now asserts that it owns 25 springs in the Huachuca Mountains and shouldn't have to ask anyone for permission to maintain its own water line. The Forest Service says Tombstone holds permits for just five springs, and it argues the city is trying to exploit a natural disaster to expand its water system. With the conservative Goldwater Institute taking on Tombstone's legal work, the court battle has blossomed into a full-blown states rights dispute. Tombstone is getting the attention of activists from Utah, New Mexico and other Western states who say the federal government has gone too far. It has become ground zero in a rekindled Sagebrush Rebellion. ""I'd love to say that this is a partisan issue and that if this administration changes, it's going to be all sweetness and light,"" said Caren Cowan, a Tombstone native who now heads the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association. ""But I have 22 years of experience telling me otherwise. It's not a partisan issue."" Cowan said she has battled the Forest Service often on behalf of ranchers in her state and has found that ""people in Washington just don't understand the West. They don't understand the wide open spaces and how we live and how we manage the land."" The federal government controls millions of acres in the West, and some folks believe the feds have reneged on a promise to turn over large swaths to local control once statehood was achieved. It's a battle cry once made by oilmen and ranchers, and now state and local governments are taking up the cause. The leaders of the Jarbidge Shovel Brigade, which in 2000 used volunteer muscle power to move a boulder and reopen a wilderness road near Elko, Nevada, rallied to Tombstone's side. A nonprofit organization was set up, and Tombstone so far has received $2,000 in donations and about 400 shovels. The Jarbidge contingent then traveled to Tombstone, hiked up the mountain and labored on the pipeline. So did Ken Ivory, a state representative from Utah, who won passage of legislation that seeks to turn over federal land to his state. He says the conflict playing out in Tombstone is an example of the Forest Service dictating to, rather than working with, local government officials. He says the feds suddenly cut off Tombstone's access to springs and roads the city has maintained for 130 years under ""an arbitrary and irrational federal policy."" As a result, Ivory said, Tombstone ""is minutes away from going up in smoke"" because it is ""a wooden town in the middle of the desert in the middle of a drought."" At the center of the debate is the Mexican spotted owl. ""What is more important, owls or the people of Tombstone?"" James Upchurch, a Forest Service supervisor who oversees the wilderness, was asked in court earlier this year. Upchurch responded that there was no easy answer, which left jaws dropping on Tombstone's side of the courtroom. So far, the Forest Service had been winning in court; Tombstone's request for an emergency injunction went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court but was turned down. The feds seemed to be losing in the court of public opinion, though. Tombstone tells a compelling story, portraying the Forest Service as a rogue agency of obstructionist, tree-hugging bureaucrats. The Forest Service had offered little comment, and when it did say something, it sounded to the people of Tombstone, well, tree-hugging and bureaucratic. But the rangers came out in force on Friday, presenting their helpful side. A group of Forest Service firefighters hiked up the mountain and used a two-man crosscut saw to take down a tree and clear a path for the pipeline. While everyone agrees the relationship between Tombstone city officials and Forest Service rangers has improved in recent weeks, their differences simmer just below the surface. The agency is working with the city to come up with a plan to keep water flowing to Tombstone, but it isn't standing down. The Forest Service granted permits Thursday for the city to bring the all-volunteer shovel brigade into the canyon to shore up the pipeline. Tombstone has until 8 p.m. Saturday to finish the job. And so, under an unforgiving desert sun, about 100 people -- including Old West cowboy types with monikers such as ""Whiskers"" and ""Cowboy Doug"" -- gathered at Tombstone's old high school football field Friday for the first day of an event that was billed as part protest and part work party. Cowan, who heads the cattle growers group, grew up in Tombstone and remembers playing powder puff football on that field during the 1970s. Her great-grandfather was among Tombstone's first settlers and made a name for himself in banking and ranching, but she considers herself ""an economic refugee from Arizona."" She says she knows all too well how difficult navigating Forest Service regulations can be. ""The idea that the Forest Service is trying to take water away from my hometown is just beyond words,"" she said. ""I'm very proud to be here today to help and to fight. We're going to fix this, and the Forest Service is going to listen."" The three-mile hike up the mountain was grueling in the 100-degree heat. The trail is steep and rocky, and some of the volunteers didn't make it to the top. Those who did found themselves moving boulders, digging trenches and sliding on gravelly slopes. Soaked with sweat, they staggered down the mountain after a couple of hours of hard labor. ""It's just a lot of manual labor,"" said Ben Headen, president of Tombstone's American Legion post. It was frustrating, he said, because ""we shouldn't be doing it by manual labor, we should be using equipment."" His friend Tim Ferrick, a fellow veteran, said he considered it his ""patriotic duty"" to stand up for Tombstone's water rights. Meanwhile, Tombstone's cause has found a champion in Washington. U.S. Rep. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, recently introduced H.R. 5971, the Emergency Water Supply Restoration Act. It proposes to set aside Forest Service restrictions against the use of construction equipment during state-declared water emergencies. Flake and Nancy Sosa, Tombstone's archivist, were among the witnesses who testified before a subcommittee of the House on Friday. Flake said: ""The unforeseen consequences of federal laws and regulations threaten to do something outlaws, economic busts and the Arizona desert couldn't: Kill the town too tough to die.""","Volunteer shovel brigade heads to hills to fix Tombstone water line by hand .

"(CNN) -- No carry-on luggage? No problem. American Airlines may soon allow customers without carry-on luggage to board right after first class and elite status passengers -- and before other coach customers hauling luggage into the passenger cabin. The airline has been quietly testing the program for several weeks to positive response at Dulles International Airport, Baltimore Washington International Airport, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, said an American spokeswoman. ""This boarding test is one more example of the progress we're making to provide our customers with an exceptional travel experience as we leverage innovation to evaluate and improve every step of the customer journey,"" said American spokeswoman Andrea Huguely, in a statement. Huguely added that this is ""a limited test."" ""Should we decide to modify our regular boarding process, we will be informing our people and our customers first,"" she said. The policy makes sense to travel blogger John DiScala of JohnnyJet.com, who first noticed and tweeted about the American test program during the boarding of a Chicago flight at the Fort Lauderdale airport last week. ""The plane doesn't make money when it's sitting on the ground,"" he said. ""Having people without carry-ons board (first) makes the boarding process quicker. They're always waiting for people with bags (to stow their bags). And they're always trying to get people to check their bags (for a fee)."" Other airlines already reward passengers . American was the first airline to charge a checked bag fee in 2008. But it's not the first airline to give priority to passengers boarding bag-free. Alaska Airlines has been offering early boarding for passengers with no carry-ons since October 2011. ""We don't offer this on every flight, but do offer this on our fuller flights,"" said airline spokeswoman Bobbie Egan, via e-mail. Those passengers get to board after travelers needing assistance or traveling with children, uniformed members of the military, first class and frequent flier passengers. In addition to allowing its frequent fliers and purchasers of premium seats to board first, Frontier Airlines also boards customers without carry-on luggage ahead of burdened passengers. American carriers collected $2.6 billion in baggage fees in the first three quarters of 2012, according to Department of Transportation figures.","Passengers without carry-on luggage may board after first class and frequent fliers .

"(CNN) -- Multiple Obama administration officials tell CNN that the White House is not pushing to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill this year. A fence separates the United States from Mexico in the U.S. Border Patrol's Yuma Sector in San Luis, Arizona. While it's a top priority for the president's first term, White House spokesman Nick Shapiro says ""the president has consistently said that he wants to start the discussion later this year because our immigration system is broken ... but the economy comes first."" The White House insisted that Thursday's New York Times story reporting that President Obama would start addressing immigration ""isn't news."" Administration officials say the president previously told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce that he's always planned to start discussions on immigration reform this year. ""There are a lot of things on his plate and a lot of pressing issues relating to the economy. I don't think he expects that it will be done this year,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday. But the mood on Capitol Hill could be different. Jim Manley, senior communications adviser for Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, tells CNN that the majority leader ""intends to try to take comprehensive immigration reform to the floor later this year, probably in the fall."" The situation in the House is trickier. A vote on the hot-button issue could hurt freshman Democrats who were elected in swing districts. But House Democrats were presented with compelling evidence that voters want to see them trying to fix the immigration system. During the House Democrats' February retreat, Pete Brodnitz, who works for the same firm that does polling for the president, argued that Democratic House members should promote their own immigration reform plans. ""The downturn in the economy has not weakened the case for comprehensive reform and has the potential to strengthen the case for it,"" Brodnitz said. He added that Democrats must take a lead because ""the problem won't go away as long as the GOP continues to raise it"" and that since Democrats run Congress and the White House, that ""makes us increasingly accountable for results."" There are roughly 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States. In addition to making a way for some of them to stay in the country legally, CNN has learned the Obama administration wants to remove incentives to enter the U.S. illegally, beef up border security and work with Mexico to cut down on illegal immigration.  Watch how the immigration fight is shaping up » . Obama will rely on a bipartisan, diverse group of experts to help build the framework for legislation, two senior administration officials said Thursday. The White House is expected to start work on the issue as early as May, the officials said. Meanwhile, the administration is dismissing suggestions that taking on immigration this year will put pressure on Obama's already ambitious domestic agenda. Even before the debate begins, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, is throwing the first punch, saying: ""President Obama's amnesty plan is a dangerous path for our nation that will sacrifice the rule of law."" As a senator, Obama supported immigration legislation backed by President Bush, which would have increased funding and improved border security technology, improved enforcement of existing laws, and provided a legal path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants. He also voted to authorize construction of a 700-mile fence along the U.S.-Mexican border. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said Thursday that Congress was willing to work with Obama on comprehensive immigration reform. ""We must solve the immigration issue, and we can, even in these difficult economic times. I believe there is a real chance of passing comprehensive reform this year, and the Senate panel on immigration will begin a series of meetings and hearings later this month with an eye towards meeting that goal,"" said Schumer, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on immigration. But is the political climate right for immigration reform to be brought up, given the struggling economy? Marisa Trevino, who runs the blog LatinaLista.net, said there's simply ""never going to be a good time"" for immigration reform. Trevino argues that immigration is tied to economic growth, and therefore timely. ""It's not going to be popular with some people, but I think this actually is a good time to bring it up because immigration is tied so closely with our economy, and what drives economic growth is economic development."" It's a point that one longtime immigration attorney agrees with. ""The immigration lawyers community really believes that it's long overdue. ... There are actually many economic studies and reports that confirm that there's a stimulus benefit to immigration reform,"" said Laura Danielson, who is the chairwoman of the immigration department at the firm of Fredrikson & Byron. ""There's a lot to be said for the fact that immigrants stimulate our economic growth, particularly those already living here, who are hiding in the shadows, [undocumented workers] who would be able to buy homes and come out in the open and work more effectively by perhaps starting businesses,"" she added. CNN's Dan Lothian and Ed Hornick contributed to this report.","Obama does not expect immigration reform to come this year, press secretary says .

"London (CNN) -- Despite the spring sunshine, the start of the London Marathon on Sunday was a somber occasion. Thousands of runners joined in a 30-second silence on the start line to remember those killed and injured by the blasts near the finish of the Boston Marathon on Monday. Before the tribute, signaled by a whistle blast, an announcer told the massed runners: ""We will join together in silence to remember our friends and colleagues for whom a day of joy turned into a day of sadness. ""Let us now show our respect and support for the victims of the tragedy in Boston."" The runners, many also wearing black ribbons as a Boston tribute, then poured over the start line to begin the 26.2-mile race. Along the route, the mood became more festive, with loud cheers and applause for the passing runners from the spectators lining the barriers. Prince Harry also made an appearance, visiting the finish line to show his support for the race stewards. READ MORE: Silence falls over London Marathon . Tatyana McFadden, who won the women's wheelchair marathons in London on Sunday and in Boston last week, dedicated her Sunday victory to those who died or suffered in last week's Boston bombings. ""We hope such small acts will help the healing process. Other efforts are in the works,"" her mother, Deborah, told CNN. McFadden, who was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, spent her early years in a Russian orphanage -- walking on her hands because she had no wheelchair -- but embraced athletics after she was adopted and brought to the United States by her new family. The winner of the men's wheelchair race was Australia's Kurt Fearnley, and the winning runner in the men's elite race was Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia. The first-placed runner in the elite women's event was Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya. Fellow countrywoman Edna Kiplagat came in second. The race is being staged amid heightened security, as police take extra precautions after the Boston Marathon bombing six days ago. Although some spectators admitted to slight apprehension about coming out Sunday, the prevailing mood seemed one of solidarity. ""If you live your life just scared of what's going to happen, you won't do much,"" one man near the finish line told CNN. ""I think it's important everyone comes and just shows that there are thousands of people who are here for the right intentions."" More than three-quarters of those taking part in Sunday's race are raising money for charity. Race organizers are also donating 2 British pounds to the One Fund Boston -- set up to help those most affected by the Boston bombing -- for each runner to cross the finish line. With about 35,000 runners, that's expected to come to about $100,000. Mayor of London Boris Johnson tweeted Sunday to wish all those involved in the event good luck and ""a great day out,"" adding, ""@bostonmarathon our thoughts are with you today."" Race director Hugh Brasher urged participants in an e-mail Friday not to lose sight of what the London Marathon stands for. ""One of the original aims of the London Marathon was 'to provide some fun and a sense of achievement in a troubled world,' "" he wrote. ""Following the tragic events in Boston earlier this week, that goal will be even more meaningful when the running community comes together on the start line of this Sunday's race."" Several hundred additional officers were on the streets for the event, a move the Metropolitan Police said was intended to ""provide visible reassurance to the participants and spectators."" Police also appealed for anyone there to take extra care with their belongings, to avoid sparking security scares. Hundreds of thousands of spectators usually turn out to support those taking part in the race. WATCH: Boston wheelchair champ races London . Chief Supt. Julia Pendry, police commander for the event, said police worked with the organizers, partners and other emergency services to ensure the right plans were in place. ""Following the terrible events in Boston, we are providing additional visible reassurance to the public in what is naturally a worrying time,"" she said. ""I would stress there is no change to the threat level to London and nothing at this stage to link the Boston bombings to the London marathon."" Will Geddes, managing director of threat management company International Corporate Protection, told CNN this week that it is ""very difficult"" to secure a marathon because of the length of the route. Any potential terrorist ""will be looking for the largest number of casualties they can achieve, so the start point and the finish point will no doubt be two areas the Metropolitan Police will be focusing on and how they can secure those,"" he said. But, he added, ""to a certain degree, there is only so much they can do."" The course, which starts in southeast London, wends through the Canary Wharf business district and passes by some of the capital's most famous landmarks, including Tower Bridge and Westminster, before finishing near Buckingham Palace. Last summer, authorities implemented a huge security plan to keep the city safe during the London Olympics. And they sought to reassure the public ahead of Sunday's race, with calls for supporters to come out in droves to show solidarity after the tragic events in Boston. Sport Minister Hugh Robertson told the UK public broadcaster, the BBC, ""The best way for us to react is to push ahead with the marathon, to get people on the streets and to celebrate it as we always do in London -- and to send a very clear message that we won't be cowed by this sort of behavior."" The London Marathon's chief executive, Nigel Bitel, also said, ""It's a great occasion, the London Marathon, and I know that people will want to come out and send a message of support to runners on the day.""

"(CNN) -- A city official in the remote Brazilian Amazon village of Envira told CNN that five members of the Kulina tribe are on the run after being accused of murdering, butchering and eating a farmer in a ritual act of cannibalism. The village's chief of staff, Maronilton da Silva Clementino, said Kulina tribesmen took the life of Ocelio Alves de Carvalho, 19, last week on the outskirts of Envira, which is in the far western part of Brazil that bumps up against Peru. Portal Amazonia newspaper reported that the Indians escaped after being held for a few hours in the city's police station. No arrest warrants were issued. Brazilian law does not allow the military or civil police to enter Indian lands, Portal Amazonia reported. It is still unknown how many people took part in the alleged cannibalistic ritual, although several Indians have fled into the jungle fearing prosecution, the newspaper Diario do Amazonas reported. Clementino said the victim was herding cattle when he met with a group of Indians who invited him back to their village. ""They knew each other and they sometimes helped one another. They invited him to their reservation three days ago and he was never seen again,"" Clementino said. ""The family decided to go into the reservation and that's when they saw his body quartered and his skull hanging on a tree. It was very tragic for the family,"" he said. The news of the incident came from the Indians themselves, who apparently bragged about eating the man's organs, Clementino said. Members of the tribe told residents of Envira -- where 190 Kulina families brush shoulders with non-tribal Brazilians -- that they held a cannibalistic ritual in which they cooked the victim's organs, Clementino said. He said Kulina Indians began surrounding the police station where the suspects were briefly interrogated. Villagers told authorities they are incensed by the lack of response from FUNAI, Brazil's National Indian Foundation. ""The family is very frustrated with the law here, which protects the Indians and doesn't help protect us,"" he said. ""They start drinking and local farmers here are afraid who could be next."" Clementino said groups Indians -- often outnumbering police -- pose a security threat to locals. He said the man's family are upset that authorities did not arrive until three days later. But a FUNAI official told the newspaper Voz do Acre that access to Envira is very difficult, requiring long boat or helicopter rides. According to FUNAI, about 2,500 Kulina live in Brazil's Acre state, which borders with Peru, where 450 Kulina live. This remote jungle corridor is known for its isolated tribes. The Kulina are classified as an ""isolated"" tribe but some have contact with the non-indian population. The Kulina are also known for their complex language. FUNAI studies show that Kulina women speak a completely different language from the men. According to FUNAI, there are 460,000 Indians in Brazil and 1,300 indian languages. There are 55 groups considered to live in isolation.","Five members of the Kulina tribe on the run after being accused of cannibalism .

"(CNN) -- At Dubai's newest hotel, an elevator ride is a journey in itself. The JW Marriott Marquis Dubai officially opened Wednesday as the world's tallest hotel. Granted the official record from the Guinness Book of World Records, the latest icon in Dubai's skyline is made up of two towers standing 72 stories, 1,164 feet. Only one tower is currently open; the second is slated to open in 2014. It's the first of the Marquis brand of JW Marriotts -- ""reserved only for the most iconic properties within the Marriott International portfolio,"" according to the company -- to be built outside North America. The hotel adds nine restaurants and five bars and lounges to the dining and nightlife options in the city. Nine glamorous movie star hotels . While dwarfed by the Burj Khalifa, currently Dubai's and the world's tallest manmade structure at 2,723 feet, it's the tallest building entirely dedicated to a hotel. Still, it's not the world's highest hotel. That title goes to the Ritz-Carlton in Hong Kong, which occupies the top floors of the 1,601-foot-tall International Commerce Center. The JW Marriott Marquis Dubai hopes to tap into the MICE market (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions), a segment that in the United States is worth about $106 billion, according to JW Marriott. ""The hotel will fill a long identified gap in the market where groups, meetings and conventions of up to 1,000 people can meet, sleep and dine under one roof,"" said Rupprecht Queitsch, general manager of the new property.

"(CNN) -- ""May God bring you pain, Bashar."" The curse is from a woman as she stands over a young child, dressed in purple pants and a matching shirt. Cursing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, she asks why the girl had to die -- one of 10 children killed by shelling Sunday on a playground in a Damascus suburb, according to opposition activists. The woman's cries are among a host of heart-wrenching moments captured on video from Deir al-Assafir. Posted on YouTube and quickly spread via social media, it begins by showing the bodies of two seemingly dead little girls on the ground, then two more bodies in a car, then adults carrying even more limp children. A young girl on the pavement cries uncontrollably until she's picked up. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said cluster bombs from Syrian warplanes killed children while they were playing. Alexia Jade, a spokeswoman for the opposition-run Damascus Media Office, said residents in Deir al-Assafir believe the attack was committed by the government in retaliation for rebels taking over a nearby military airport. Rami Abdulrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, however, said it's not known what happened. Whatever the explanation, the images represent another sordid chapter in Syria's bloody civil war. The violence raged again on Monday, with at least 168 people killed across the country. More than half of those reported deaths -- 90 of them -- were in the capital and its suburbs, with another 35 in Aleppo, the LCC reported. Rockets pummeled the Syrian city of Atma on Monday, not far from a key command center for the rebel Free Syrian Army, a witness said. Two rockets fell within several hundred meters of the command center, the witness said. It's unclear whether any rebels were injured, but the building did not appear to be damaged. About 40,000 civilians have been killed since the first protests sprung up about 20 months ago against al-Assad's government, according to the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. Meanwhile, more than 380,000 Syrians have fled the violence and become refugees in countries such as Turkey and Lebanon, the United Nations reports. The Syrian government routinely refers to its battle against ""terrorists,"" the term it uses for rebel fighters and extremist elements in the country. On Sunday, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported on several military operations ""in pursuit of al Qaeda terrorists who are perpetrating acts of killing and looting,"" in some instances identifying those killed and where they purportedly came from, such as Saudi Arabia, Libya and Palestinian territories. CNN cannot confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within Syria. What started as security forces cracking down on mostly nonviolent protesters has spiraled into a civil war between pro-government forces and the rebels, including the Free Syrian Army. Rebel fighters scored significant victories over the weekend, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Overnight Saturday, rebels stormed Marj al-Sultan airport, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) from Damascus, and destroyed two helicopters and a number of vehicles. In Daraa province, rebels claimed to have taken over a base near the Jordanian border that once housed the Syrian army's fourth battalion. The violence has spilled over, too, into neighboring countries. Turkey has turned against its former ally, asking its fellow NATO members last week for Patriot missiles to bolster its air defenses because of several deaths in its territory blamed on Syrian forces. A delegation of Turkish and NATO officials was to begin a site survey Tuesday to determine where to deploy the batteries, the Turkish military said Monday. ""The deployment of the Air and Missile Defense System is a precaution for defensive purposes for possible air and missile threats from Syria, and is not for the establishment of a no fly zone or for offensive maneuvers,"" according to the Turkish military statement. The bloodshed has seeped into Lebanon as well, where there have been deadly clashes between pro- and anti-Syrian factions. And Israel's army fired warning shots toward Syria earlier this month after a mortar shell hit one of its military posts. Protests continue in Egypt . CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Ammar Cheikhomar, Samira Said, Raja Razek, Roba Alhenawi and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: 168 dead across Syria, mostly in the Damascus area, an opposition group says .

"(CNN) -- Inspired by Psalm 103 verse 11 -- ""For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward those that fear him"" -- two men with lofty ambitions in a midwestern town of the United States have finally realized them after months of endeavor -- and then some. In July 2012, in a bid to attract golfers and tourists to the Casey Country Club in Illinois --a town with a population of just under 3,000 -- Bolin Enterprises operations manager Michael ""Bo"" Bohannon and the company's vice president Jim Bolin concocted the idea of building a golf tee of biblical proportions. The two men hope the 30 ft ยพ structure, which has those words from Psalm 103 carved into its wooden edifice, will be officially crowned the world's largest golf tee. It is not the first over-sized Bolin Enterprises construction -- last year the company produced the world's largest wind chime, a 55-foot long structure now proudly hanging in Casey. Hours of chainsaw carving, 60 gallons of glue and 120 pounds of screws were involved in the making of the colossal tee, which weighs 6,659 pounds and consists of yellow pine boards. Measurements were taken and sent to the Guinness World Records, with the club hoping it will be officially verified as the world's biggest tee, possibly as early as next week. It will be sited on the 10th hole on the Casey course, although that is just the start for Bohannon and Bohin to put Casey on the tourist map. If the record is confirmed, an 18 ft diameter hollowed out golf ball will be constructed to sit atop the tee, from where golfers will be able to tee off. ""Hopefully our world's largest tee construction receives the Guinness recognition next week,"" Bohannon told CNN. ""We have plans to erect the tee this spring at the Casey Country Club. Prior to the installation, there is a lot of prep work to do -- earthwork and landscaping -- that will accompany the world's largest golf tee. ""We truly hope this will be a draw to golfers and visitors worldwide,"" added Bohannon. ""Once the tee is erected, we plan to build the ball for the top. This ball will be constructed so golfers will be able to tee out of it. This portion of the project will be completed later this year. To maximize the potential pulling power of having the world's biggest tee in Casey, Bohannon is also thinking on a grand scale to market the town's gargantuan landmark. ""We have contacted a world famous golfer and invited him to be the first to tee off of it when it is ready for the grand opening,"" said Bolin's operations manager. ""If you know of any other famous golfers that would like to be a part of this, by all means please pass along my contact information to them as we would love to have them. ""We would also plan to offer the opportunity to 'Sponsor the Golf Ball' to the major golf companies."" The current record is 26 ft 8in and belongs to the students of Jerry Havills Team Problem Solving Course at Bay de Noc Community College (all USA) in Escanaba, USA, on 23 July 2009. The students' effort had a head diameter of 88.9 cm (35 in) and a shaft width of 35.24 cm (13.87 in).","A golf course in Casey, Illinois hopes to soon boast the world's largest golf tee .

"(CNN) -- I give Bob Newhart a call because I have a hunch he will have something funny to say. I am right. The subject: Loyola of Chicago and the 50th anniversary (this Saturday) of its winning 1963's national championship of college basketball. The man on the phone: A proud Loyola grad, maybe the school's most well-known: a comedian, actor and star like few others in this great big TV Land of ours. Hi, Bob. ""You know, my first memory of Loyola basketball actually goes back to 1949,"" says the 83-year-old Newhart, who is still second to none in knowing how to begin a monologue. ""Loyola's team came home from winning a big tournament game that we weren't supposed to win. 'Giant killers!' they were called. We were all naturally proud of our team. 'Loyola the Giant Killer.' ""Then it turned out that players from the team we beat (Kentucky) got caught shaving points. They were crooked. So I guess that giant we killed wasn't quite as gigantic as we thought.'' Funny now. Not so much back then, but funny now. Happily, a funnier thing happened on March 23, 1963, when the Loyola Ramblers shocked the two-time defending champion Cincinnati Bearcats and the whole college basketball world by winning the NCAA tournament. Bleacher Report: Last-Minute Bracket Advice . That team: . Won by the wacky score of 111-42 over Tennessee Tech in the tournament's opening game, to this day, the largest margin of victory in the NCAA Division I men's tournament's history. Next defeated a Mississippi State team that had to sneak OUT of the state of Mississippi just to play the game, certain parties down South objecting to their all-white boys occupying the same court as a Chicago team with non-white young men on it. Next bounced the Big Ten boys from Illinois by 15 points. Next decked the Duke team in the Final Four by 19 points. And then, down by 15 points in the second half, came back to conquer Cincinnati in overtime 60-58 on a last-second shot. What a story. ""We win! We win!"" roared the Ramblers' radio voice, Red Rush, on the air. The NCAA title game had also been on national TV for the first time, but Chicago's WGN delayed it to air a live telecast of a high school championship game instead. ""So throughout the city,"" Chicago historian and author John R. Schmidt recalled recently for WBEZ 91.5 FM, ""many crafty radio listeners used their knowledge of Loyola's amazing comeback to clean up on barroom bets."" I tell Newhart this. ""Ah, now THAT's the Loyola I know!"" he says mirthfully. No joke, though, Bob: Loyola (29-2) was king of college ball. Not another university from the state of Illinois has won the NCAA men's crown since. UCLA took 10 of the next 12. The football-free Jesuit institution from the Near North Side of Chicago went back into relative anonymity in big-time athletics, an onlooker as the likes of Indiana and Duke and (yes) Kentucky became lords of the rings. Loyola hasn't even been in the NCAA tournament field since 1985. Bleacher Report: 25 Greatest Moments in March Madness History . I recently enjoyed phone conversations with three of Loyola's surviving 1963 players -- Les Hunter, Jerry Harkness and John Egan -- while doing a story for History Channel's magazine. Each is pleased by this burst of golden anniversary limelight, although it sure would be a nicer honor if the Naismith basketball museum in Springfield, Massachusetts, would heed a proclamation made by lawmakers in Springfield, Illinois, that the Ramblers should be enshrined in the game's Hall of Fame. Because guys of a certain age can tell you: This was one amazing team. ""I remember pulling for them because Cincy was a basketball power back then and this little school from Chicago beat them,"" said Bill Frieder, 71, who later would coach Michigan and Arizona State. ""I think everyone was stunned."" Stunned by the WAY this school won, not just the fact that it did win. It used just five players. No other Rambler set foot on a court in that NCAA title game except Hunter, Harkness, Egan, Ron Miller and the man whose last-instant putback of a Hunter miss gave Loyola the championship, Vic Rouse. Coach George Ireland did have a couple of other valuable guys for a while, but Pablo Robertson (who became a Harlem Globetrotter after college) and Billy Smith flunked their midterms in early February and were ruled ineligible. ""We played five guys a lot, and we had our tongues hanging out a lot,"" Egan, 70, a Chicago attorney, told me. He didn't mean the way Michael Jordan's tongue would later hang out. This was sheer exhaustion, not a facial tic. The coach ran the Ramblers ragged, pressing opponents from one end of the gym to the other, no matter how many tongues hung. Loyola scored 100 points or more in its first six games. Topped the 100 mark 11 times in all. Lit up Western Michigan for 123. One of the season's first foes was North Dakota, coached by Bill Fitch, who would later take the Boston Celtics to the 1981 NBA championship. An under-used member of Loyola's team who is still with us, Rich Rochelle, did an interview not long ago in which he remembered the way Ron Miller guarded the visiting team's top player so relentlessly, Miller even followed the kid during a timeout to the North Dakota bench. Substitutions with a big lead? Sympathy for the losing side? Nah. ""Ireland had no mercy,"" Rochelle recalled. The coach had a bleeding ulcer and a curt manner at times, which didn't endear him to his own guys. But he's the one who got them there. His contacts in New York City landed him Harkness, Miller and Robertson. He turned to Nashville to recruit high school teammates Hunter and Rouse. He added the feisty Irish local boy Egan to the stew. He started four black players when such a thing wasn't being done. Mississippi State's players didn't cotton to racial bias any more than the Chicago school's did. They and their coach defied Dixie politicians by catching a plane to Michigan for a regional game in East Lansing. Hands were shaken, black and white, and a splendidly played game ended 61-51 in Loyola's favor. Eight days and two victories later, Loyola found itself in Louisville, Kentucky, making history. Championships were not in Loyola's DNA. It did get to that National Invitation Tournament title game at Madison Square Garden in 1949. But the wins over City College of New York and Kentucky lost their luster when point-shaving accusations were confirmed against both losing teams. Bleacher Report: Power Ranking Cinderellas with Bracket-Busting Potential . Newhart, class of '52, didn't go there for basketball. ""No, but I think at that time they enforced a 5-foot-9 or over limit,"" he fibs. When a chance came for his college to become as famous in sports as he had just become in show biz, Newhart said he didn't pay attention because ""I was still worrying they'd find me out and make me go back to being an accountant."" He was for real and Loyola was as well. Oh, the Cincinnati kids did go up by 45-30, but the Ramblers wouldn't fold. Harkness, a legit All-America player, and Hunter, one of the most unfairly underrated college players of all time, led the way. In overtime, tied at 58, Harkness expected to shoot, but said, ""I just didn't feel it."" He passed to Hunter, who let it fly but missed. Rouse rebounded it and laid it in at the horn. Fifty years later, not everybody's still around. The buzzer-beating hero, Rouse, died in 1999. The cagey coach, Ireland, went two years later. The rah-rah radio guy, Rush -- ""He eyes it, he tries it, he buys it!"" -- was silenced eternally in 2009. Several players do remain, basking in the glory of their school's one shining moment. As do other alumni. ""It's a great, great school,"" said Newhart sincerely, and not just because the Newhart Family Theater on campus now bears his name. ""You know, my sister taught there, and she became a nun. And the new pope is a Jesuit, and I'm a Jesuit-educated guy, so I'll be praying that he knows what he's doing.

"(CNN) -- As the head of world soccer, Sepp Blatter has been trying hard to address the problem of racism in football since infamously telling CNN in 2011 that instances of it on the pitch could with solved ""with a handshake."" Now, however, he is facing calls to quit as FIFA president following comments on Friday which have led to accusations that he has gone soft on fighting the issue. ""Sepp Blatter is erratic, his behavior is erratic, his declarations are erratic. He should just quit. It's completely unacceptable, what he said,"" Valeriu Nicolae of the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) group told CNN Friday. After supporting Kevin-Prince Boateng, who walked off in protest after being racially abused during a friendly match in January, Blatter last month invited the AC Milan player to join the ruling body's new anti-racism taskforce. But the 77-year-old appeared to have taken a big step backwards with his comments on Friday, casting doubt on his previous statements that offending clubs should face points deductions or even be relegated. ""Can we bring an end to violence or racism by docking points or relegating a team? Or would such measures lead people to come to games to get the match abandoned,"" Blatter said in a speech at a meeting of the company Early Warning System, with which FIFA works in its fight against match-fixing. ""We should do all we can but there's a risk that if we have matches replayed or if we punish clubs on the sporting front, it will open the door to hooligan groups who will come to deliberately cause trouble."" FIFA confirmed to CNN that the quotes were correct, but insisted that Blatter had not reversed his position on punishments for racism -- and that the comments merely raised the challenges faced in implementing such penalties. ""Today he reiterated the need for punishment that hits hard against any form of racism,"" a spokesperson from FIFA's media department said. ""He underlined that fines achieve little, but points deductions and exclusion from competitions would be effective measures. He also stressed that prevention must go hand in hand with punishment. ""He acknowledged that the implementation of these sanctions might pose some challenges, such as a potential risk that the system could be abused by some spectators for the only purpose of getting a very unfair advantage for their team. ""Such issues will be carefully examined and will in no way alter the FIFA President's very strong commitment towards the eradication of the racism scourge from football and his zero tolerance towards any form of racism."" Nicolae's call for Blatter to resign -- and thus end a reign that began in 1998 -- was supported by others on online social media. ""Sepp Blatter just gave every racist in football a licence to abuse. Even by his standards this is utterly outrageous,"" CNN's Piers Morgan wrote on Twitter, adding to the #Blatterout hashtag. Nicolae said Blatter is out of touch with the realities of the game. ""Maybe it would be good for Sepp Blatter to spend some time outside of fancy meetings,"" he said. ""He would understand a lot more if he would come and see a game, see what is happening during the games and see what happens when you take the right measures. ""(What he said) makes absolutely no sense and goes against all our experience."" FARE works closely with European soccer's ruling body UEFA, monitoring crowds at matches and reporting any racist behavior that its staff witness. UEFA has been criticized for what is seen as relatively light punishments for racist offenses, but has come down harder on offending clubs this season. Italy's Lazio has been punished on four occasions due to misbehavior by its fans. ""I have great confidence in UEFA,"" Nicolae said. ""UEFA proved time and time again that they know what to do and they did the right thing. With FIFA I don't have that. Blatter is erratic and I think it's time for him to resign."" On Friday, the Greek football federation banned Giorgos Katidis for five club matches and fined the AEK Athens midfielder 1,000 euros ($1,300) following his Nazi-style goal celebration last month. The ban is largely symbolic as the 20-year-old had already been suspended for the rest of this season by his club, and the federation had earlier banned him for life from representing his country. Also on Friday, FIFA confirmed that Brazil will not be completely ready to host June's Confederations Cup -- a precursor event to next year's World Cup in the South American country. ""It will be a fantastic tournament -- but not all operational arrangements will be 100%"" secretary general Jerome Valcke wrote in his monthly column on the FIFA website, on the same day of the inauguration of the third of the tournament's six host stadiums at the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador. He said work on venues in Recife, Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro (the redeveloped Maracana stadium) is due to be completed by the end of this month. There will be 12 grounds used at the 32-team World Cup, which will host 64 matches -- four times that of the eight-nation Confederations Cup. ""It is impossible to expect this to happen in the shortened preparation time -- in most cases, less than two months instead of the scheduled six -- due to the compromises we made with the cities,"" Valcke said. ""I want to reiterate: this will be impossible to repeat for the FIFA World Cup, and has been acknowledged by the federal government and LOC. The deadline for the FIFA World Cup stadiums delivery stands firm as December 2013. There will be no compromise.""","Sepp Blatter causes angry response after remarks made during a speech .

"(CNN) -- The ruler of Dubai's prestigious Godolphin operation in Britain is at the center of a major doping scandal after 11 of the stable's horses failed drugs tests. Godolphin said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum was ""absolutely appalled"" after regulator British Horseracing Authority (BHA) found anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- in 11 samples taken from 45 horses from its Newmarket stable in eastern England on April 9. ""I deeply regret what has happened,"" said Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni, who now faces a BHA disciplinary inquiry, in a statement by Godolphin. ""I have made a catastrophic error. Because the horses involved were not racing at the time, I did not realize that what I was doing was in breach of the rules of racing. ""I can only apologize for the damage this will cause to Godolphin and to racing generally."" Anabolic steroids work on horses as they do on humans -- helping to build strength and muscle. Stanozolol was still legal as recently as 2008, when Big Brown won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in the U.S. after having regular injections. His trainer's admission, and the subsequent outcry, led to the drug being widely banned. However, it is still legal for out-of-competition use in Australia, such as helping to overcome injuries. ''Any horse that has been treated with anabolic steroids must be free of them by race day,"" Racing Victoria vet Dr Brian Stewart told the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday in reaction to Monday's Godolphin announcement. Godolphin is one of the world's most successful stables, with more than 2,000 race wins since it was formed in 1992. It has been named Champion British Owner eight times, including last year, while Sheikh Mohammed and his family have also taken the title on multiple occasions going back to the 1980s. Godolphin's Certify, unbeaten in four career outings and winner of the Shadwell Stud Fillies' Mile at Newmarket last September, was one of the horses to test positive and will not be allowed to take part in the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket next month. ""Mahmood Al Zarooni has been advised of the analysts' findings and has been visited by an investigating officer,"" said Adam Brickell, Director of Integrity, Legal and Risk for the BHA. Former Dubai Gold Cup winner Opinion Poll was another horse to test positive. Opinion Poll was ridden to victory in that race by Frankie Dettori, who worked for the Godolphin team for 18 years, but is now serving a six-month ban for doping. Urgent review . ""This is a dark day for Godolphin,"" said the British stable's racing manager Simon Crisford. ""We are all shocked by what has happened. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed was absolutely appalled when he was told and this is completely unacceptable to him. ""We will await the outcome of the BHA inquiry before taking any further internal action. ""Sheikh Mohammed has instructed me to begin an urgent review of all of our procedures and controls. That is already underway and we will take advice from the BHA in completing it."" The BHA said the disciplinary hearing will take place at the ""first available opportunity."" ""Ethylestranol and stanozolol are anabolic steroids and therefore prohibited substances under British Rules of Racing, at any time -- either in training or racing,"" added Brickell, outlining the sport's doping rules on the BHA's website. ""The horses which have produced positive tests will also not be permitted to race with immediate effect and for an extended period of time. ""As part of the ongoing process, a decision will be made as to what period this suspension will be imposed for. ""The BHA understands the importance of this process being carried out as quickly as possible because of implications for betting markets."" Zarooni joined Godolphin in March 2010 and won the St. Leger, one of Britain's five classics, in his first season. ""News reports so far suggest this case is an aberration and is not indicative of wider use of anabolic steroids in British horse racing,"" said National Trainers' Federation chief executive Rupert Arnold.","A total of 11 horses at prestigious stable Godolphin fail drugs tests .

"(CNN) -- Thailand's rice bowl is now Thailand's nightmare. The Chao Phraya River delta nourishes the nation's vast rice paddies. But Friday, the river and its many tributaries eyed the capital, Bangkok, like a ferocious animal stalking its prey. Monsoonal rains have flooded Thailand's plains and now the bursting river threatens to drown Bangkok. The water has already turned parking lots into marinas, markets into lakes and houses into homes suitable only for fish. It has gushed into houses of the holy -- Buddhist temples stood amid rising water -- and into sanctuaries of the vulnerable. Fifteen elephants, including seven mothers with babies and a 9-year-old known for its painting skills, are stranded on top of Ayutthaya's Royal Elephant Kraal. The elephants climbed on top of the building last week and are going hungry now that food can only be brought in small quantities on rowing boats. Elephants can swim but the babies might drown in an attempt to escape. In Bangkok and other deluged cities and towns, the strong carried the feeble on their backs. The young aided the old. Everyone helped each other. It was hard to imagine that last year, Red Shirts battled Yellow Shirts in deadly political street protests that prompted a state of emergency in Thailand and left a nation deeply divided. Disaster brought them back together this week. An English Facebook page set up to help foreigners in Thailand saw a frenzy of action Friday. ""Kidney failure patients'd like to get in dialysis process can contact HSRI co. with NE Kidney Medico"" ""Free shuttle bus from Dusit Thani hotel to TU DOME available for donation stuffs logistic tomorrow"" ""Slippers (foam type) needed for any sizes at Don Muang Evacuation Cent."" ""Both lanes of Bangkruy-Sainoi Rd... flooded"" With 283 people dead and another 8 million affected by the flooding, the fears were real in Bangkok. Workers stuffed sandbags furiously and shored up barriers. Evacuation centers began to fill with people. Banjong Palim, 43, said he had never seen anything like this in his lifetime. He was forced to flee when his suburban Bangkok home drowned. Some recalled the devastating 2004 tsunami that wiped out everything with walls of water. And panicked. Ed White watched the river flow over containment walls in Ayutthaya. He stacked the furniture as high as he could get it in his house in there, and felt lucky it was made of concrete and brick, not wood, like so many traditional Thai homes. White grew up in Ocean City, Maryland. He was used to hurricanes and the Atlantic's fury. But this was different. The water was not raging. There weren't torrents. It just kept inching upward. Slowly, but surely. At the market where White gets his hair cut, people scurried, spreading rumors born from fear. In two hours, they said, everything would be under water. The flood was coming! The flood was coming! White moved to Thailand in 2003 to work for a rubber company. Friday, he said he had moved into a second-floor company apartment in Bangkok, confident he would be safe there. Meanwhile, his employer had made a fortress out of the rubber factory, erecting concrete barriers around everything as though it were a war zone. For many it was a losing battle. The military helped evacuate them, whisking them away by boat or carrying them through chest-high water. Just about every day now, rain has come down hard, exacerbating worries. This is already the worst flooding Thailand has seen in decades. Some wondered Friday how much worse it could get. The government's Flood Relief Centre chief said that Bangkok would be spared. But with a chance of thunderstorms in the forecast for the next few days, reassurances Friday were difficult to swallow.","Thailand's monsoonal flooding is the worst in decades .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The death toll from the earthquake in southwest China's Sichuan Province has risen to 180 people with another 24 missing, China's Xinhua news agency reported Sunday. More than 11,200 are injured. Thousands of emergency workers, including soldiers, rushed to reach the affected zones in the hilly region, and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang traveled to the area from Beijing, state media reported. Xu Mengjia, the Communist Party chief of Ya'an, the city that administers the area where the quake struck, told state broadcaster CCTV that because of landslides and disruption to communications, determining the total number of casualties may take some time. Students gather outside to escape the quake . The quake struck just after 8 a.m. local time Saturday, about 115 kilometers (70 miles) away from the provincial capital, Chengdu, at a depth of around 12 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There was conflicting information about the earthquake's strength, with the USGS putting the magnitude at 6.6 and the China Earthquake Networks Center gauging it at 7.0. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, some of them as strong as magnitude 5.1, the USGS said. Authorities have responded by sending rescue workers to the area around the epicenter, briefly halting flights at the airport in Chengdu and suspending high-speed rail operations, state media reported. The event stirred memories of the devastating earthquake that hit Sichuan in 2008, killing more than 87,000 people. First responders to Saturday's quake reported that the damage caused didn't appear to be as severe as what was seen in the aftermath of the 2008 disaster, according to CCTV. Fan Xiaodong, a student in Chengdu, said when the tremors began to shake buildings in the city, many of his startled classmates rushed out of their dorms, some of them wearing only the clothes they'd been sleeping in. At first, Fan said, he only felt a slight trembling as he dozed in bed. ""I thought it was my roommates shaking the bed,"" he said. ""But the shock became stronger soon, and it came to me that an earthquake happened."" The epicenter was in Lushan country, a district of Ya'an. That area is home to China's famous giant pandas and houses the country's biggest panda research center. CCTV reported that the pandas at the facility, which is about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) from the epicenter, were safe. Residents of Chongqing, a sprawling metropolis more than 300 kilometers (about 190 miles) from Ya'an, said the quake also shook buildings there. Are you there? Send your iReports .

"(CNN) -- We learned a few things on Monday night, those of us watching Anderson Cooper on ""AC360,"" about Alex Teves, one of the people who died in the gunfire at theater 9 in the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colorado. We learned that in high school, ""for no reason whatever,"" as his father put it, Alex always wore white T-shirts and blue jeans, and that one day some 400 to 500 kids from the school wore the same outfit, declaring an unofficial ""Alex Teves Day."" We got to meet Alex's best friend, Ryan Cooper, who spoke about how people were ""drawn to him."" And his girlfriend, Amanda Lindgren, who told us, among other things, about the last act of Alex's life, which in some ways is all you need to know: He dove across her body to protect her from the bullets. Opinion: Three Aurora heroes gave their lives . Perhaps most painfully, we met Tom Teves, the father of Alex, a likeable, visibly hurt man. He said, when Cooper asked how he was holding up: ""It's the worst day of my life every day. Alex was my firstborn son. I love him with all my heart."" Teves had something to say to the news media, too, something impossible to ignore: ""And if we don't stop talking about the gunman -- so somebody took a gun and went in and shot a 6-year-old girl? Why are we talking about that person?"" He went on: ""I would like to see CNN come out with a policy that said, 'Moving forward, we're not going to talk about the gunman. What we're going to say is: A coward walked into a movie theater and started shooting people. He's apprehended. The coward's in jail. He will never see the light of day again. Let's move on'... CNN, Fox News, the major networks. Why don't you guys all come out with a policy that says, we're not going to show this [killer] again? That would be my -- that would be my challenge to you and to every network."" As compelling and tempting as his plea is, I would argue that Teves is only half right. The mass killings certainly dominated the news, quickly becoming one of the biggest stories of 2012. Nearly three quarters of the nation has been following it ""very"" or ""fairly"" closely, according to Pew Research Center. Still, if mass shootings weren't big news, you would worry. James Holmes' face, meanwhile, made it to a number of front pages in the wake of the massacre, as shown in Newseum's Today's Front Page feature, but not as often or as large as you might think. And you did want to know what he looked like, didn't you? Even Tom Teves went to court to see his face. Looking into the minds of killers . Like Teves, many people suspect that some sort of media glory is part of the payoff for these mass killers. And that seems plausible. But the truth of the matter is we don't have a clue. Nor do we have an idea if some sort of media blackout about them would have any effect in preventing this type of incident from occurring again. Court appearance fuels theories about Colorado shooting suspect . As an analogy, one he freely admitted is on a wholly different level, Teves used the example of people running on fields during professional ball games. The media stopped showing such incidents, he pointed out, and now that the TV cameras no longer show these runners, he asked, ""When was the last time you saw somebody jump on the field?"" The problem, unfortunately, is that people still jump on ball fields. I just search for ""people running on baseball fields"" on Google and up popped recent incidents in 10 cities, all recorded on cell phones, as well as two websites that collects such videos. Stories of survival amidst the shooting . What really causes mass murderers to commit their crimes? Mental illness? Environmental factors? Something worse? News media speculation about the motive isn't helpful to anyone. Yet people around the country are concerned; some are even traumatized by this event. It is natural to wonder why and how the horrific shooting happened. And to the extent that it can address such big questions, news organizations should make the necessary inquiries -- dig into the suspect's past, find indicators of questionable behavior, look for signs of terrifying intent. This is the media's responsibility. Warning signs of violence: What to do . News outlets should never glorify killers in any way. In the chance that being on television and across the front pages could be a draw to killers, the news media must err on the side of caution in its coverage. The prime focus should be properly on the victims. And, I would add, on the victims' friends and families, who tell us so movingly that they will remember. As Teves said, ""You know, Alex would have expected us to live. We're going to live."" To report that kind of love and guts is essential. Still, when something like this happens, we are, as a society, like a tribe discussing the events around the campfire. Reporters are something like the tribal scouts. There are wolves, and we have questions: How many wolves? How do they act? Which way should we go? How to help the victims . Here, too, we have questions: Who is this killer? What concrete facts give clues to how he got that way? Is there any law or cultural change that might deter the next one? Were signals missed? All of this matters. Tell us about the wolves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Hoyt.","On Anderson Cooper's show, a father of a victim of the Aurora shooting asks about media's role .
Mike Hoyt: Is Tom Teves right to say news organizations should ignore the mass killers .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Friday that he would strike down a ban on same-sex marriage if he were on the Supreme Court, and that he believed his administration was obligated to weigh in on a California case before the justices. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Obama opened up about his rationale for signing off on a government brief that was filed in an appeal of California's 2008 prohibition of same-sex marriage. The Justice Department brief submitted on Thursday urged the high court to invalidate the ban. ""Let's treat everybody fairly. Let's treat everybody equally,"" Obama said. The issue could be a defining moment in Obama's presidency, similar to the political impact last year when the high court upheld the health care reform law that he spearheaded. The president and the nation have evolved on same-sex marriage . It is rare for a president to become personally involved in the legal and political considerations in a Supreme Court appeal, and sources say Obama spent a good deal of time reading up on the issue and articulating his views privately before the brief was filed. The administration is not a party in the California appeal, one of two same-sex marriage cases before the high court this term, and was not required to offer an opinion although the Justice Department often does so in important constitutional cases. Sources said Obama made the final decision for the administration to submit a viewpoint and signed off on the wording. He said Friday that he believed it was ""important for us to articulate what I believe and what this administration stands for."" The California law, known as Proposition 8, does not provide any rationale for ""discriminating against same-sex couples,"" Obama said. The evolution of the nation's 'first gay president' When faced with a question of whether that's constitutional, Obama said it was ""important for us to answer"" honestly. ""And the answer is no,"" he said. Obama once supported only civil unions, but he described his position as evolving and declared during last year's election campaign he was personally comforable with letting gays and lesbians marry. The president further raised expectations of an expanded view in the sweeping rhetoric of his inaugural address in January. Much of the reasoning in any government brief would, in large part, reflect Obama's personal thinking, gained from his years as a former constitutional law professor. He offered a studied analysis of the issue. ""What we've said is that same-sex couples are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny. The Supreme Court needs to ask the state why it's doing it, and if the state doesn't have a good reason, it should be struck down. That's the core principle, as applied to this case,"" Obama said Friday. ""Now, what the court may decide that if it doesn't apply in this case, it probably can't apply in any case,"" he continued. ""There's no good reason for it. If I were on the court, that would probably be the view that I would put forward. But I'm not a judge, I'm the president."" The new Obama has his heart on his sleeve . CNN Supreme Court Producer Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Obama says he'd strike down California prohibition, but ""I'm not a judge""

"(CNN) -- The killing of 6-month-old Jonylah Watkins has been held up as a new low in Chicago's struggle to keep senseless death off its streets, as a rallying cry to do something about gun violence and as proof that no one -- even the most innocent among us -- is safe. On Tuesday, it was also about Jonylah. Hundreds braved the cold on the city's South Side, standing in a line that wrapped around the New Beginnings Church as they waited to pay their respects. Some people, many of whom had never met Jonylah or her family, broke down in tears when her hearse passed by. Inside the church, more tears flowed. Mourners walked past the infant's open casket, as pictures flashed behind on a screen behind -- an ultrasound, from baby showers, of her as a newborn. To the side sat stuffed animals, including one large pink teddy bear, and a drawing of Jonylah with the words, ""God's angel."" Chicago baby shot while dad changes diaper . ""It's just very, very sad,"" said Victor Brunner, a friend of the family. ""I just wish we could do something about it."" Beyond remembering the little girl, doing something in the wake of her violent death was a prevailing theme at the funeral. Some of that message involved taking personal responsibility; some of it involved coming together, as a community, to reject gun violence. Brunner said progress might start with being more willing to ""snitch"" to police about those behind shootings that have ravaged his city in recent months. The church's pastor, Corey Brooks, told mourners this incident should show people they must always be prepared for ""tragedy"" to come to their doorstep. Jeneen Thomas, an activist who did not know Jonylah's family but felt compelled to come out Tuesday, says she hoped the pointless killing of a baby girl, as she sat on her father's lap, wakes people up. She hopes that there won't be more parents like Jonylah's, faced with the horrible task of burying their child. ""We sort of left our children behind and to fend for themselves,"" Thomas said. ""And it's time for us to take our children back."" Some 506 people were killed in Chicago last year, according to local crime statistics, up from 433 in 2011.

Jonylah became part of those grisly statistics when one bullet struck her March 11, not several as initially reported, as she sat with her father in a vehicle on the South Side. That bullet damaged several parts of her small body, and she died the next day. Her father, Jonathan Watkins -- believed to be the target of the shooting, according to police -- was also hit. Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said Watkins has been cooperating with authorities, adding that police have surveillance footage of a van in which the gunman sped away after the shooting. Despite his injuries, Watkins attended his daughter's funeral. Mourners also saw images of him holding his baby girl. Brooks, the church's pastor, said he hopes Tuesday's outpouring of support -- and the positive steps he hopes Chicagoans will take in their own lives, and those of their neighbors, to prevent such violence -- will show the world their suffering and their dedication to stand behind one another. ""The world thinks that there's nothing but animals that live on the South Side, but we've proved to them today that we are real people ... with real experiences,"" he said. ""And we hurt just like they hurt."" CNN's George Howell reported from Chicago, and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg has claimed a surprise pole position for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix, but qualifying positions were once again almost a secondary consideration in a race already overshadowed by ongoing protests in the Gulf kingdom. The German was more than two-tenths of a second faster than triple world champion Sebastian Vettel, who admitted he held back at the end when he saw how far ahead the Mercedes driver was in Saturday's final session. ""When I got told the gap to P1, it was clear that even with a perfect lap he was unbeatable today, but nevertheless I'm very happy,"" said the Red Bull star, who won last year's race from pole at the Sakhir circuit. ""We managed to save some tires throughout qualifying and it will be about tire degradation tomorrow, so we'll see what happens."" F1 interactive: Explore Sakhir's highlights . Rosberg won the second pole of his career, but downplayed his hopes of repeat last season's success of winning from the front of the grid in China. ""For the first time this season everything went perfectly today and that's a great feeling,"" he said. ""The race tomorrow is a different story. It will be difficult, especially with the rear tires, and we know that other teams were stronger than us on the long runs on Friday. It will be a big challenge to stay ahead, but starting from the front helps."" Fernando Alonso will start third for Ferrari, and the Spaniard is confident of repeating his victory last time out in Shanghai after also deciding to conserve his tires by giving up his final run, with track temperatures rising above 40C and playing havoc with the rubber. ""At the last corner, I saw I was half a tenth to one-tenth slower so we decided to come in and save one lap on those tires -- you never know if you'll have to use it in the race,"" Alonso said. He will start the race alongside teammate Felipe Massa after Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton was dropped five places from fourth -- having needed a new gearbox after problems in final practice -- and Red Bull's Mark Webber was demoted from fifth to seventh because of his grid penalty following a collision in the China race. ""I started on the hard (tires), it can be that I gain positions on the first stint because of that,"" said Massa, who took a different tire strategy to Alonso. The Force India duo of Paul Di Resta and Adrian Sutil will start fifth and sixth respectively, while Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen -- who was fastest in Friday's practice sessions -- will be eighth. Hamilton will be alongside 10th-placed former McLaren teammate Jenson Button, who succeeded him as world champion in 2009. ""The best chance to gain some positions will come at the start and then we'll see how it goes,"" said Hamilton, who won pole in Shanghai. ""Tire degradation will be a huge factor so it's going to be a very interesting race."" Several media outlets reported that human rights protesters clashed with Bahrain's security forces into the early hours of Saturday morning. Bernie Ecclestone, the head of Formula One Management, told a group of television reporters that the Bahrain government was ""stupid"" to host the race because it can be used ""as a platform for people to use protesting."" ""The government here were stupid, in a lot of ways, to put this race on,"" the 82-year-old said Saturday ahead of the qualifying sessions in response to a question from a BBC reporter . The race was canceled in 2011 after violent protests by factions of the majority Shiite population against Bahrain's Sunni rulers. F1 bosses tried to reschedule it for later that year but backed down in the wake of widespread criticism and a lack of evidence that the situation had stabilized. Last year's race passed without incident, though there were again protests before it was held. The Bahrain government insists the race will bring long-term benefits to its people. ""F1 brings significant benefits to everyone in Bahrain, especially economically,"" it said in a statement Friday. ""Bahrain upholds the right to peaceful protest. It is a country made up of many communities with different views on its development. ""This is why it has launched a dialogue between all political groups to address political issues in a manner that will ensure the country develops in a sustainable way. It should be noted that in some cases protests encouraged by extreme opposition groups result in deliberate and targeted violence.""","Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg earns second pole position of his career in Bahrain .

"(CNN) -- ""Downton Abbey"" has called it a season, and the concluding chapter had its fair share of the romance, births, deaths and scheming that make the show ""must-see television"" every week. That is, for everyone but Maggie Smith, it seems. But for those of us who have been watching since the very beginning, this season was seven episodes of welcoming new characters and mourning the loss of a few fan favorites. Oh, and did we mention Shirley MacLaine?! Production will soon begin on Season 4, but until then, here are our top five takeaways from Sunday's finale. 1. The end of Matthew Crawley . The end EVERYONE saw coming. It was reported months ago that main cast member Dan Stevens would be shutting the door on his time at Downton. It wasn't long after that news of a death in the Season 3 ender began circulating. For many, it was just a matter of putting two and two together. But for those who remained unspoiled, the car accident at the end of this episode may have come as quite the shocker. The end had come for heartthrob Matthew Crawley. After this, and the earlier death of Lady Sybil, it appears no life is brought into the world of Downton without the loss of another. Yes, Mary gave birth to her first son -- a child who will never get to know his father. The family dynamic at our favorite Edwardian country home certainly has changed since the start of the Roaring '20s. We now have a widow, widower, two young children and a teen occupying space at Downton. How will the family come to terms with the loss of Matthew? How will Cousin Isobel deal with the death of her only son? Will Lady Mary find love again? One can only hope the next season explores this hardship instead of jumping a year or two ahead. 2. Romance is in the air . Almost everyone at Downton faced love life developments before last night's credits rolled. Lady Edith appears more interested in following her heart than her mind as she warms up to the advances of her married editor, Gregson. But is Edith willing to risk bringing scandal to Downton as ""the other woman""? We'll have to wait for the next season to know for sure. Anna and Bates appear more in love than ever as they share picnics and let their hair down on their Scotland trip with the family. In the presence of the warring MacClares, Robert and Cora drew closer and shared a couple of tender moments. Even Mrs. Patmore and Isobel each found an admirer in this sprawling episode -- or so they thought. It's not long before both those flames are put out, but it was a pleasant surprise seeing focus spent on the loves of our favorite supporting players. 3. Tom is still dealing with his upgraded social status . Tom did not join the Crawley clan on the Scotland trip, and decided to spend his time with the staff to keep from feeling alone. There was one employee in particular who caught Branson's attention: new maid Edna. Edna develops an attraction to the widower and proceeds to act on her feelings with a kiss. It doesn't take long for Carson and Hughes to catch onto the pair, and they fire the chambermaid before things can go any further. Tom is still reeling from Sybil's death and is still struggling with his transition from employee to family member. He wants to relate to both sides, but has to accept that he is leading a new life. Will Tom find a new mother for Baby Sybbie? Perhaps, but neither he nor fans may be prepared for that just yet. 4. The staff finally get out of the house for a spot of fun . It was nice to see the staff get some time off from their employers. It's not often we see this bunch out of uniform enjoying a little fun outdoors. The trip to the fair provided a chance for the gang to let loose. We also got a nice resolution to the Thomas-Jimmy conflict that plagued episode six. After Jimmy is jumped by a trio of men, it's Thomas who comes to his rescue! There may be a heart of gold hidden underneath those layers of lies and schemes that initially made Thomas so villainous. It's not long before Jimmy thanks Thomas and the two agree to be friends. Strictly platonic, that is. 5. Cousin Rose is here to stay! That's right, much to many fans' dismay, we haven't seen the last of Rose. In fact, the rebellious teen will be moving in with the Crawley family as her parents travel to India. We suspect it's only a matter of time before the Dowager Countess grows tired of Rose's antics and has her killed off, but perhaps that's mixing confusion with desire. Either way, the latest lady to enter Downton is sure to stir up trouble, and we all know the Abbey can't run without a little scandal mixed in.","Popular British drama on PBS has viewers hanging on every arch word .
Birth and death, love and loss mark season-ender .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- About 2.5 million young people have received health insurance coverage as a result of health care reform measures that President Barack Obama signed into law last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday. The Obama administration trumpeted the figure as a sign that the controversial legislation is succeeding. About 2.5 million more people, aged 19 to 25, have health insurance than had it before the law took effect because of a provision that lets young adults remain on their parents' insurance plans through age 26, the agency's National Center for Health Statistics said. ""Moms and dads around the country can breathe a little easier knowing their children are covered,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement. Young adults have traditionally been the age group least likely to have health insurance, the Department of Health and Human Services said. The policy extending dependent coverage up to age 26 took effect for plan renewals beginning in September 2010. The new estimates show that by the following June, the percentage of insured young people in that age group rose from 64% to 73%, Health and Human Services said. Based on census figures, that percentage change equates to about 2.5 million young people, the agency said. Obama signed the health care reform package into law in March 2010 after the legislation made it through Congress with no Republican support. GOP leaders argued the bill creates a government bureaucracy, burdens small business owners, and will prove costly. The measure involving coverage for dependents up to age 26 has generally not been a source of dispute. ""This is the result of a bipartisan policy change that was also in our alternative -- there was no reason it had to be enacted as part of a job-killing government takeover of health care,"" Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said Wednesday. CNN's Josh Levs and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: The provision was also supported by GOP, a John Boehner spokesman says .

"(AOL Autos)  -- With gas prices as volatile as a swarm of bees that just had their honey stolen, the SUV market has started to shatter. You can rent cargo trailers from U-Haul and other retailers, starting as low as $14.95 per day. If you drive a big SUV or pickup truck, you're probably trying to think of ways to save fuel, or -- gasp -- getting rid of that big vehicle and driving a fuel-efficient sedan or coupe. But you probably bought that truck for a reason -- you need to carry people and or lots of stuff. Don't despair. There are options if you decide to ditch the behemoth. If you're used to throwing everything from bicycles to sports equipment to home improvement material in the back of your SUV, abandoning it for a smaller more efficient car doesn't have to mean abandoning your active lifestyle. There are plenty of simple, creative solutions to enhance the utility of your ordinary car. Just use common sense when you load up, and you can safely transport an amazing load of equipment and people in a smaller vehicle. Here are 10 tips and products to help you out: . Tip No. 1: Install a trailer hitch . If you're serious about getting the most out of your car as a gear-hauler, you're going to want to install a trailer hitch. SUVs and pickup trucks usually come equipped with a receiver from the factory. Most cars today built are unibodies or monocoques (meaning that the body pieces and structural elements are all fused together into one structural element), as opposed to body-on-frame construction (where the body pieces are attached to an underlying frame). In general, body-on-frame vehicles are more robust, and have higher tow ratings, but unibodies can still be equipped with trailer hitches. U-Haul is an excellent source for information about hitches and towing, and sells self-install tow hitches starting at around $120. Tip No. 2: Know your limits . Overloading your car can be disastrous. It's not only dangerous, it's also potentially damaging to your vehicle. You can damage your suspension components, wheels and tires, ruin your transmission and over-tax your engine if you aren't careful. Check your owner's manual for payload limits and towing capacities before you start piling cargo in and on your vehicle. And don't forget to account for the weight of passengers when you calculate your payload -- a sedan full of six adults could weigh a thousand pounds or more, especially if you've got big friends. AOL Autos: Safest cars -- sedans . Tip No. 3: Bring the bicycles . Riding a bike is fun but you've got to get your bicycle to the starting point. There are several safe, efficient ways to transport your bike outside a sedan. Toss it on the trunk -- For a temporary mount that doesn't require any permanent alteration to your car, a trunk-mounted carrier is a great choice. Tuckerman Racks has models that start as low as $100. AOL Autos: Most popular crossovers . Rack it on the roof -- Take advantage of that lower profile, and mount a specialty bike rack on your car's roof. Yakima makes several models starting at around $150. Just watch out for low-hanging branches and avoid urban parking garages. Strap it to the spare -- Some small crossovers, like the Toyota RAV4, store their spare tire on the tailgate. Allen Racks and other companies make bike carriers that use the spare tire mount as a support for bike racks starting around $100. AOL Autos: Top 10 most fuel-efficient cars . Hook it on the hitch -- If you followed Tip No.1, and you have a hitch receiver installed on your car already, there's a wide variety of hitch-mounted bicycle racks to choose from, including Hollywood Racks, which has models starting at about $125. Tip No. 4: Roof rack systems . Just because you're not driving a Tahoe anymore, that doesn't mean you can't get your kayak to the shore. Thule makes a roof rack system (starting at around $320) that can be fitted with a multi-kayak carrier that will have you floating downstream in no time -- just don't forget your paddle. Tip No. 5: Soft-sided car top carriers . What if you're going camping and you just need to get your tent to the campsite? Then a soft-sided car top carrier might be the ticket. Piggy Pack makes a variety of weather-resistant carriers that start at just $69. AOL Autos: Affordable crossover vehicles . Tip No. 6: Streamlined car top boxes . If you're traveling a little further, or if you want a little bit of additional security for your rooftop load, a streamlined car top box, like the ones from Thule, can do the job, starting at around $200. In addition to great protection from the weather, these lightweight fiberglass carriers are designed to reduce wind resistance and noise, so they're quieter and more efficient than soft-sided carriers. Tip No. 7: Hitch-mounted cargo carriers . If you are nervous about hauling gear on top of your vehicle, and you followed Tip No.1, you could take advantage of a hitch-mounted cargo carrier like the ones from B-Dawg, starting at about $125. AOL Autos: Top 10 SUVs to take off-road . Hitch-mounted cargo carriers have distinct advantages over roof-mounted units: They are much easier to load; once loaded, they have a much lower center of gravity and less of a negative effect on vehicle handling. Just don't forget that you've increased your vehicle's effective overall length, so parking and maneuvering in traffic will be a little trickier. Tip No. 8: Utility trailers . Sometimes there's just not enough room in or around your car, and you have to think outside the box. A utility trailer, like the ones from Carry-On Trailer, starts at about $500, and will help you carry that lawn mower, picnic bench or new grille home with ease. Many home centers rent utility trailers for short term use -- if you've installed a trailer hitch, you can drag that cool sale item home. Tip No. 9: Cargo trailers . If you find yourself regularly hauling sensitive large items home, like antique furniture or artwork, you might want to investigate a lightweight cargo trailer like the ones from Wells Cargo, starting at around $1,500. A closed trailer protects your cargo from prying eyes, from the weather and from the effects of wind in transit. You can also rent cargo trailers from U-Haul and other retailers, starting as low as $14.95 per day. Tip No. 10: Tow dollies . Sometimes you're doing the towing, sometimes you're being towed. If you've got too much stuff to fit inside, on top of or behind your car, maybe you should consider renting a cargo van or truck and hooking your car up on a car tow dolly, like one from Tracy Performance, starting at about $1,400. Most cars can be safely towed with a dolly -- then when you arrive at your destination, you've got your stuff, and you've got your car for quick trips. In some cases, it's the best of both worlds. And you can do that all without a full-sized SUV or pickup truck.","You can safely transport loads of equipment and people in a small vehicle .

"(EW.com) -- What a crapfest! The judges DID end up using their save this week. Before Jessica Sanchez could make it through a single verse of ""Nobody's Supposed to be Here,"" tangerine dream Jennifer Lopez had stormed the stage. ""Gimme that mic!"" she snapped. ""Shall we dance?"" she continued. ""Why didn't all you b****** watch Â¡Q'Viva!?"" Randy Jackson stepped in. ""We are saving Jessica without any doubt,"" he announced. ""This girl is one of the best singers in America. Are you kidding me? Everybody please vote for the best."" ""Are you kidding me?"" said the sparkly tongue-sticking-out emoticon pin on Randy's lapel. ""Let the people do what they want. <3 <3 <3."" Ugh, it was all so staged! To make matters worse, we'd already been warned that this charade was about to happen. ""We're gonna use our card tonight, especially with an outcome like this,"" Steven Tyler had assured Ryan once the shocking bottom three -- Jessica, Joshua Ledet, and Elise Testone -- had been announced. Could have used a spoiler alert there Steven! That tinkling sound you hear behind you is bits of evil gargoyle overlord Nigel Lythgoe's granite teeth crumbling to the floor from over-clenching. Just beautiful. Anyway, the judges saved Jessica. Not surprising. Ryan Seacrest carried on his annual tradition of separating the top and bottom three contestants and then making the only officially ""safe"" person -- Skylar Laine -- ""pick the group you think you belong with."" Skylar promptly marched over to the couches and refused, but Ryan's meaty grip got her in the end. Turned out Hollie Cavanagh, Phillip Phillips, and Colton Dixon were safe this week. Jimmy Iovine had predicted Hollie, Phillip, and Elise for the bottom three. After Joshua and Jessica landed there instead, Jimmy growled, ""I'm gonna get a new flat-screen."" So you can...see everyone better? Great plan. Best wishes to Sebastian the crab on his continued wealth. James Durbin -- that mythical creature with the tail from season 10 -- returned with blonde ambition to scream ""Higher Than Heaven,"" off his debut album Memories of a Broken Disaster. I thought I was high myself when they kept randomly zooming in on his drummer's feet. This time the cloth dangling from the Durbinator's butt was white, possibly as a metaphor for the diapers he can now afford to purchase for his baby. Good looking out! I kept worrying that Jennifer Hudson's ""before weight"" hologram from the Weight Watchers commercials would creep into the frame and try to duet with her on ""Think Like a Man,"" but luckily Ne-Yo did instead. Does anyone not love Ne-Yo? I kept obsessing over this during their performance filled with push-and-pull flirting and plenty of sass appeal. I think he is universally adored. I even ended up marveling that the ""design"" on his white t-shirt was just a big black rectangle. That's genius, I thought, genuinely. Ne-Yo's gotta have it, Ryan! Hopefully no one was home or visiting or peering at you through a hidden camera as you watched the Top 7's ""Raise Your Glass"" abomination. I actually apologized to my recapping buddy Tanner out of secondhand embarrassment. Two visual moments did save these dirty little freaks from complete failure, though: Phillip gently caressing Colton's hair-animal in his lap (?!) and a final pose featuring an off-balance Ryan Seacrest clutching a Coke cup (!!). Cheers, queers. Can you believe Jessica received the lowest amount of votes? Was this J. Lo's best acting performance since ""Out of Sight""?

"(CNN) -- The United States is offering millions of dollars for the whereabouts of seven key members of the al Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab, a Somalia-based terror group behind bombings and attacks in the region. The announcement posted on the website of the U.S. State Department's Rewards for Justice program offers $7 million for information on the location of Ahmed Abdi Aw-Mohamed, the founder of al-Shabaab. In announcing the bounties on Mohamed and his key associates Thursday, the State Department called al-Shabaab ""a threat to the stability of East Africa and to the national security interests of the United States."" Kenyan forces take Somali town from militants . This year, he and al Qaeda's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, released a joint video formally announcing a merger between the terror groups. The announcement of the bounties follows U.S. strikes that have taken out key al Qaeda leaders, including this week's killing of Abu Yahya al-Libi -- considered the longtime public face of the group. Last year, a U.S. drone strike killed Anwar al-Awlaki and al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was shot to death by U.S. commandos. Al-Shabaab, which has battled Somalia's weak transitional government since 2007, controls much of southern Somalia and is active around the capital city of Mogadishu. The U.S. listed it as a terror organization in 2008. ""The group is responsible for the killing of thousands of Somali civilians, Somali peace activists, international aid workers, journalists and African Union peacekeepers,"" the State Department said. Kenyan blast injures 28; authorities disagree on cause . The State Department is also offering up to $5 million each for information leading to the location of four of Aw-Mohamed's associates, who make up his inner circle: Ibrahim Haji Jama, Fuad Mohamed Khalaf, Bashir Mohamed Mahamoud, and Mukhtar Robow, who acts as the group's spokesman and spiritual leader. In addition, it is offering up to $3 million each for two of the terror group's other leaders: Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi and Abdullahi Yare. Al-Shabaab's reach extends beyond Somalia's borders. It claimed responsibility for 2010 suicide bombings that killed more than 70 people in Uganda and threatened attacks against U.S., Kenyan and Burundian interests in the region. Mohamed is considered al-Shabaab's operational commander in Somalia and is believed to have been born July 10, 1977, in the Somali city of Hargeisa. Somali, AU troops target militant stronghold . Among Mohamed's inner circle targeted is Jama, described by the State Department as a senior leader. He sometimes uses the alias al-Afghani, which translates as ""the Afghan,"" a nickname he was given because he fought in Afghanistan for several years. Khalaf is considered the group's leading fundraiser, while Mahamoud is a described as a military commander, according to the Rewards for Justice site. Hersi, according to the website, is the group's head of intelligence and Yare is the head of its media operations. The Rewards for Justice program was established in 1984 and has paid some $100 million to more than 70 people for information about terrorists. Rewards go as high as $25 million for information on al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. The State Department calls the program ""one of the most valuable assets the U.S. government has in the fight against international terrorism.""","The United States is offering $7 million for the whereabouts of al-Shabaab's founder .

"(CNN) -- Evidence is mounting that it is possible to control the virus that causes AIDS with early treatment, so further therapy is not immediately needed. A recent study in the journal PLOS Pathogens reports that 14 patients with HIV, who received antiretroviral treatment within 10 weeks of infection, had their viral loads decreased so much that scientists say they are ""functionally cured."" ""The amazing thing is that it seems that by early treatment, we can induce this type of control of infection in 10-15% of individuals,"" says lead study author Asier Saez-Cirion of the Institute Pasteur in Paris. The usual definition of a ""cure"" is that someone who was once infected has no virus left in his or her body. But in situations like this one, it can be said that there is ""sustained remission that doesn't require therapy,"" says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That's what scientists call a ""functional cure."" ""You haven't eradicated the virus, but interestingly, when you stop therapy, even though the virus is still there and you can measure it, it doesn't come back with a vengeance and cause disease in the person,"" he says. These 14 were identified out of 70 people with HIV whose treatment had been interrupted. The virus in these patients is not completely eradicated, even though they have been off therapy for up to about 10 years. There is still a possibility that disease will return in these patients, but the chances are low, Fauci says, and being able to live many years without therapy is ""a pretty good bonus"" of early treatment. Normally, after a person gets infected with HIV and years pass, the virus establishes a reservoir in the long-lived T-cells called lymphocytes, Fauci explains. ""Those latent cells are kind of like embers of a fire, and when we take our treatment away, those latent embers reignite the infection and a fire breaks out,"" says Dr. Michael Saag, professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who was not involved in the study. But when a person with HIV receives aggressive treatment soon after infection, according to the hypothesis put forth by the study, the virus forms a reservoir in the shorter-lived lymphocytes. When therapy was stopped, according to this theory, the viral reservoir was extremely low. Cases of HIV are most often not treated immediately after infection, Fauci says. People commonly find out they have HIV because they feel poorly or happen to take an HIV test; in these situations, the infection may have been in the body for several years already. Where everyone wants to work with HIV . The new study's conclusion ""is even greater fortification for the concept of really seeking out people and identify(ing) them very very soon after they get infected, and treating them aggressively,"" Fauci says. That means screening people in high-risk communities. It's important to understand the distinction between controlling the virus in the new study and so-called ""elite controllers,"" people who, because of their genetic makeup, are able to control HIV naturally. Fewer than 1% of people with HIV have this immune response. Saez-Cirion's study demonstrates a significantly greater probability of control when therapy is administered early. Saez-Cirion and colleagues are following up in a clinical trial that looks at 90 HIV patients who were treated early. The study also gives extra hope that a vaccine could work, Saag said, as it suggests that priming the immune system can induce a response that controls the virus. ""If it can be induced in a large number of people, then I would guess that that immune response could well be protective against an infectious challenge,"" Saag said. This new study adds to another development in the HIV research arena. Earlier this month, a baby in Mississippi who was born with HIV was also shown to be ""functionally cured."" She received high doses of three antiretroviral drugs within 30 hours of her birth. There is no evidence, two years later, that HIV is present in her blood. This probably does represent a ""cure,"" more so than in the 14 patients in French study, but the treatment was delivered much faster than it would be in adults, Saag says. The baby's case could change the practice for how high-risk babies are treated, says Fauci. Usually, babies born to mothers with uncontrolled infections, or whose HIV is diagnosed close to delivery time, receive antiviral drugs at preventative doses for six weeks, and then HIV therapy if the virus is detected. Prevention can mean no babies with HIV . In the case of this baby, a more aggressive treatment showcases a potential for a cure with antiretroviral therapy given early, researchers say. But the news about the baby isn't a total game-changer for the developed world. Usually, mothers with HIV get treatment so that the infection is not transmitted to their baby in the first place; for the United States, the situation is a ""fluke,"" Fauci said. But untreated mothers give birth all the time in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, making the baby's case more relevant to the developing world. CNN's Saundra Young contributed to this report.","14 patients treated early don't need HIV therapy anymore .

"(CNN) -- Sports reporter Erin Andrews has filed a lawsuit alleging the hotels where a peephole stalker secretly videotaped her were negligent, according to a statement from the law firm representing her. The lawsuit also accuses Michael David Barrett, who has pleaded guilty to stalking the ESPN reporter, of invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The suit, filed Thursday, alleges that Barrett received information from hotels when he called them to see if Andrews had made reservations to stay there. ""Not only did the hotels confirm that Ms. Andrews was intending to register as a guest, but they also released, without Ms. Andrews' consent, her room number. The hotels then provided Michael David Barrett a hotel room immediately adjacent to hers,"" the statement from law firm Greene, Broilett & Wheeler said. Hotels named as defendants in the civil suit include Marriott International Inc. and Radisson Hotels International Inc. Representatives from those companies did not immediately return requests for comment. ""Although I'll never be able to fully erase the impact that this invasion of privacy has had upon me and my family, I do hope that my experience will cause the hospitality industry to be more vigilant in protecting its guests from the time they reserve a hotel room until they check out,"" Andrews said in a statement Thursday. She said she filed the lawsuit ""to hold accountable those who put my personal safety at risk and who allowed my privacy to be invaded while I was a guest at their hotel, as well as for actually stalking me and making my most personal moments public."" Barrett pleaded guilty to a federal stalking charge in December 2009 after prosecutors accused him of altering hotel peepholes so he could shoot video of Andrews while she was nude. In court papers, prosecutors stated that Barrett -- an insurance company employee from Westmont, Illinois -- posted as many as 10 videos of Andrews to the internet. In March, a federal judge in Los Angeles, California, sentenced Barrett to two and a half years in prison. Andrews' civil suit, filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, accuses the hotels of negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy.","The ESPN reporter is suing the hotels where a man recorded nude videos of her .

"(CNN) -- Cholera is an intestinal infection that's rare in the United States currently. But in the developing world it's a serious problem, with 3 to 5 million cases every year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The disease brings on diarrhea, which can kill a person if he or she is not properly hydrated. A tremendous advance in hydration was invented by David Nalin, along with his colleague Richard Cash. Nalin was working in Bangladesh during a cholera epidemic in 1968, when intravenous solutions were the only treatment. He knew that an oral method of rehydration would be much more accessible and cost-effective for the people who needed it most. This idea had been around before. Other doctors had tried oral methods but failed because they had the wrong proportions, and because they were focused on trying to give every person the same ""magic bullet"" dosage of therapy. Nalin recognized that the volume of oral rehydration therapy required isn't the same for every patient. Individual losses need to be replaced with equal volumes of the absorbable solution. What exactly did he deliver to patients? Essentially, a mixture of salt, water and sugar in the right proportions. This simple idea has saved millions of lives -- not just from cholera, but from any diarrhea. The Lancet, a prestigious British medical journal, called this ""potentially the most important medical advance of this century."" ""The devastating conditions suffered by the Bangladeshi refugees as they fled the war with Pakistan offered ORT (oral rehydration therapy) its definitive test,"" according to an August 2003 paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. ""When the medical team ran out of intravenous fluids at the camp, oral glucose-salt packets were used to treat (more than) 3,000 patients, resulting in a reduction in the mortality rate from 30% to only 3.6%,"" the journal said. CNN's Edythe McNamee contributed to this report.","There are 3 to 5 million cases of cholera every year .

"(CNN) -- Sprinter Shawn Crawford might have been coming to the latter part of his athletics career, but his failure to inform doping regulators as to his ""whereabouts"" has landed the Olympic gold medalist with a two-year ban. The American, who sprinted to 200 meter gold at the Athens 2004 Games, has been sanctioned after failing to provide the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) with a location for drug testing three times during the past 18 months. The ""whereabouts"" rule requires athletes in advance to tell regulators where they are for one hour every day and make themselves available at that time for a drug's test. The ban means results recorded or prize money won by Crawford on or after November 17, 2012 have been scratched. CNN contacted Crawford's representative to ask if he will appeal the ban, but the agent was not immediately available for comment. ""Shawn Crawford of Culver City, Calif., an athlete in the sport of track & field, has received a two-year suspension for committing an anti-doping rule violation in which he failed to file his whereabouts information,"" read a USADA statement. ""Crawford failed to comply with the whereabouts requirements and, as a result, accrued three whereabouts failures within an 18-month period. ""A whereabouts failure for National Testing Pool athletes includes failure to provide required quarterly whereabouts filings and/or failure to be available for testing due to inaccurate or incomplete information provided by the athlete. ""USADA is responsible for the testing and results management process for athletes in the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Movement, and is equally dedicated to preserving the integrity of sport through research initiatives and educational programs."" As well as gold in Athens, which was clinched with a time of 19.79 seconds, Crawford won a silver medal as part of the U.S. 4 x 100 meter relay team. He was awarded the silver medal in the 200m final at the Beijing Games of 2008 after Churandy Martina was punished for outside of his lane.

"(Financial Times) -- China's premier has waded into an intensifying trade dispute with Europe, warning that EU investigations into Chinese-made solar panels and telecommunications equipment would backfire by hurting European consumers. ""The cases over these two types of products will hurt Chinese industries, business and jobs and also damage the vital interests of European users and consumers,"" Li Keqiang said en route to Berlin on Sunday during his first foreign trip since becoming premier. ""We express firm opposition."" Mr Li's comments mark the first time that China's top leadership has weighed in on the trade disputes, and come as the solar case -- the EU's biggest ever trade investigation -- enters a critical phase. The EU must decide before June 6 whether to go ahead with a proposal from Karel De Gucht, trade commissioner, to impose provisional duties averaging 47 per cent on imported Chinese solar products for dumping, or selling goods below cost. EU member states were due to submit their reactions to the proposal by Friday. As the deadline approached -- and even over the weekend -- those supporting and opposing duties stepped up their lobbying campaigns to try to win over undecided governments. On Sunday the vote appeared to be on a knife edge, with several people close to the investigation claiming as many as 15 of the 27 member states had opposed the duties. The commission declined to confirm this, and the numbers appeared to be fluid. A spokesman for Mr De Gucht said the commission would ""take note"" of member states' positions. ""At this stage, any potential temporary measures are an emergency response to rebalance the market place for European companies facing life-threatening dumping and unfair competition from China's solar panel industry,"" he added. Under EU rules, the commission -- not the member states -- makes the final decision on provisional duties. Imposing them without majority backing from national governments would be an embarrassment for Mr De Gucht and weaken his hand as the investigation moves toward a final outcome in December. Greg Barker, the UK's minister for energy and climate change, led a group of energy executives to Brussels last week to try to persuade the commission to drop the solar case. Philipp RÃ¶sler, Germany's economy minister, has also weighed in, publicly urging Mr De Gucht to negotiate a solution. Zhong Shan, vice-minister of China's ministry of commerce, is set to meet the commissioner in Brussels on Monday to discuss the solar case, as well as a pending EU probe into China's telecommunications network equipment suppliers, Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp. Mr De Gucht was given a green light from fellow commissioners to open an investigation after informing them he believes both companies benefited from illegal government subsidies, including cheap land and financing, and then dumped their products in Europe. Mr Li made his remarks ahead of a visit to Germany, China's biggest EU trading partner and a potentially pivotal player in determining the outcome of the investigations. At a press conference in Berlin on Sunday evening, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""Germany will make every effort so that we make real progress in these talks."" Mr Li's remarks coincide with a comment piece in Monday's Financial Times written by Wu Hailong, China's ambassador to the EU, accusing Brussels of resorting to protectionism and remarking that its ""repeated attempts to stir up trade frictions with China are astonishing and confusing"". Mr Wu said the trade cases were counter-productive at a time when the EU was still mired in recession and struggling to regain investor confidence. He also warned of broader damage to the bloc's reputation, writing: ""The commission's actions have tarnished its image as an advocate of free trade, fuelled the rise of protectionism and run counter to the commitment by the leaders of the G20 group of industrialised nations not to introduce protectionist measures."" © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","China's premier warns EU investigations into Chinese-made solar panels would backfire .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- An insidious, microscopic protein that has been found in the brain tissue of professional football players after death may now be detectable in living people by scanning their brains. Researchers say they found tau protein in the brains of five living retired National Football League players with varying levels of cognitive and emotional problems. ""It's definite, we found it, it's there,"" said Dr. Julian Bailes, co-director of the NorthShore Neurological Institute in Evanston, Illinois, and co-author of a new study that identified the tau. ""It was there consistently and in all the right places."" Using a scan called positron emission tomography, or PET -- typically used to measure nascent Alzheimer's disease -- researchers injected the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and latches on to tau. Then, the NFL retirees had their brains scanned. ""We found (the tau) in their brains, it lit up,"" said Dr. Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and lead author of the study, published Tuesday in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. What was startling, said Small, was the specific pattern of the tau they found: ""It was identical to what's seen in a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, CTE, that has only been diagnosed at autopsy."" CTE is the disease that most likely played a role in the deaths of former NFL players like Dave Duerson, Ray Easterling, Shane Dronett, and Junior Seau. What has stymied researchers for years is that tau can only be uncovered after death. Finding it in living players is considered by many researchers to be the ""holy grail"" of concussion research, according to Bailes. ""After a while it gets old and not so fulfilling to take the brain out when (an athlete) is dead,"" said Bailes, a neurosurgeon and director of the Brain Injury Research Institute, which focuses on the study of traumatic brain injuries and their prevention. ""At that point there is no solution, no answer."" More cases of brain disease found in football players . The research provides the beginnings of an answer, according to Bailes and Small. But the study is tiny, and poses looming questions. ""This is a very exciting but preliminary study,"" said Robert Stern, co-founder of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine. ""The researchers did what so many of us have been wanting to do for the last couple of years. ""The problem is that the type of PET scan they used is really not specific to what we're looking at with chronic traumatic encephalopathy."" The marker used in the PET scan -- the one that binds to tau -- is called FDDNP. The problem with using that marker, said Stern, is that it is not specific enough. It binds not just to tau, but also to another protein called beta amyloid, which is commonly seen in Alzheimer's disease patients. ""In CTE, only tau is found in abundance,"" said Stern, an Alzheimer's expert. ""What researchers saw was parts of the brain lighting up and showing abnormal findings. ... But we don't know if what is lighting up is tau alone, or beta amyloid, or both."" It's the location of the protein that is important, Small said. In Alzheimer's disease, tau is typically found in the outer part of the brain, called the cortex. ""It's different from Alzheimer's,"" said Small, director of the UCLA Longevity Center, adding that he found tau in deeper structures of the brain. ""The patterns of the scans are identical to what's seen at autopsy in other people (with CTE),"" like Seau, Duerson and Easterling, he said. ""And we know at autopsy it's primarily tau."" When tau lodges into those deep brain structures -- for example, the amygdala, which is associated with rage and other emotions, or the hippocampus, a seat of memory -- it causes major disruptions to those areas. Questions linger about long-term impact of subtle hits to the head . That disruption may be related to depression, memory problems and suicidal behavior common in cases of CTE studied thus far -- not just in retired NFL players, but in athletes in other sports and members of the military. The hope among the study's authors is that a diagnostic brain scan might one day detect burgeoning CTE in all sorts of people who suffer concussions. But the current study is drawing some skepticism, doubts that likely will not ebb until future research examines a larger study group. ""Sometimes I wish (study authors) would hang on and wait until they have a more meaningful sample size,"" said Kevin Guskiewicz, a concussion expert and director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""I think that then people would be less skeptical of the findings."" Still, Guzkiewicz is encouraged by the study results. ""Unfortunately we tend to identify these (CTE) cases when they're already on the slippery slope toward dementia and it's too late to do anything,"" said Guskiewicz. ""I'm all for trying to build on studies like this."" Building on the research -- expanding the study population -- is what Small and Bailes are working on now. In the meantime, they are optimistic about their findings. ""Right now, the (FDDNP) PET scan is the only method that we know of that can measure tau protein in living people,"" said Small. ""It's not the perfect holy grail ... but for now it seems to be showing us what we're looking for."" Football players more likely to develop neurodegenerative disease .","Researchers find a protein called tau in the brains of living retired NFL players .
Its pattern is identical to that found in chronic traumatic encephalopathy cases .

"(CNN) -- At the intersection of the two country roads, charred debris lies strewn haphazardly. The earth around it is scorched. It is here, in this corner of Dumas, Texas, that a sport utility vehicle and a gas tanker collided Sunday afternoon. The tanker's flammable cargo sent both vehicles up in flames, seriously injuring the truck driver and killing all five passengers in the Chevrolet SUV. All of those who died were teenagers. The crash, coupled with another one in Warren, Ohio, the same day, highlight that motor vehicle wrecks continue to be the No. 1 killer of youths in the United States. Such accidents took the lives of about a quarter of the 15- to 24-year-olds who died in 2010, according to the most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They outpaced the other top culprits: firearm wounds, homicides, suicides and accidental poisonings. But the wrecks mask a broader improvement: Overall traffic fatalities have been dropping in a ""historic downward trend,"" according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2005, it tallied 43,510 traffic deaths; in 2011, there were 32,367, the lowest level since 1949. In 2009, motor vehicle crashes were the 11th-leading cause of death. That marked the first time since 1981, when data were first available, that motor vehicle crashes were not among the nation's top 10 causes of death. 6 teens killed, 2 injured when overcrowded SUV flips into pond . A fatal mistake . It wasn't clear where the teens were headed in the SUV when, authorities say, the driver, 16-year-old Jacob Paul Stipe, failed to stop at a stop sign. It was a fateful mistake. As the SUV entered the intersection, a truck smashed into its passenger side, CNN affiliate KFDA reported, quoting authorities. Paul died at the scene. So did his four passengers: October Dawn Roys, 17; Elizabeth Kay Roys, 15; Derrek Lee Hager, 17; and Christopher Lee Moore, 17. The truck driver, Ezequel Melecio Garcia, was flown to a hospital burn unit in Lubbock. Best of friends . The teens were friends, said Star Tovar, assistant manager at the local Dairy Queen. ""It was always them together, all five of them always together,"" she told CNN affiliate KVII. Chris had recently moved to the area. Elizabeth and October, who went by the nickname Toby, were sisters. October leaves an infant daughter. Their parents, Robert and Sheryl Roys, wept as they spoke to the affiliate. ""They changed hair color every month,"" Robert Roys said, smiling for a moment. ""It's going to be hard not having them around because they were there all the time. I love them with all my heart and they'll always be here, in my heart,"" said Sheryl. Grief in Ohio . Hours earlier and nearly 1,400 miles away, in Warren, Ohio, six teenagers were killed when an SUV struck a guard rail and flipped into a pond. They were among eight teens who had crammed into the Honda Passport, which was later reported stolen. It was built to seat no more than five. None of the dead had been wearing a seat belt, authorities said. The teenagers were speeding down a two-lane northeastern Ohio road, authorities say. Alexis Cayson, 19, was behind the wheel, the highway patrol said. Those who died alongside her were: Andrique Bennett, 14; Kirklan M. Behner, 15; Daylan Ray, 15; Brandon A. Murray, 14; and Ramone M. White, 15. All were from Warren. The two survivors escaped by breaking the rear window in the submerged vehicle, Ohio State Highway Patrol Lt. Brian Holt said. They ran a quarter mile to a nearby home and called 911, he said. Holt said weather was not a factor in the wreck -- the deadliest in his county's history and the worst in Ohio in at least three years. 'It's numbing' Monday night, mourners held a vigil near the guard rail and alongside a makeshift memorial of Teddy bears and a cross. They released helium-filled balloons into the air to commemorate the dead. ""It's numbing. It's confusing. It's hurtful,"" said Charlene Blackwell, whose nephew Ramone White was among the dead. Grief counselors visited area schools Monday to help students and staff with the emotional aftermath.","The crash killed everyone in the SUV .

"(CNN) -- The latest string of fatal shark attacks in Western Australia is creating a climate of fear that could haphazardly undo a very important environmental law that protects great white sharks. Last weekend, 24-year-old surfer Ben Linden was attacked by a great white near Perth, becoming the fifth fatality off that coast in the past 10 months. In response, the Western Australia Fishing Minister, Norman Moore, promised to write the federal government ""to know if there has been any update on the status of the white sharks and the sustainability level at which the Federal Government will lift protection."" If Mr. Moore has his way, hundreds if not thousands of sharks will be killed in Australia. I have a problem with that. Yes, my heart goes out to the victims' families and friends who are mourning the losses of these tragic events, and I in no way downplay the pain and sadness an attack has on an entire community. Shark attacks: Is 'Jaws' back? I know, as I lost my leg and nearly my life after being attacked by a large tiger shark here in Hawaii. I do feel that these predators play a very important role in the health of our oceans, and I strongly oppose any type of shark hunting or culling program. Let me explain. By fishing for the great white shark, the bycatch will surely be a bunch of other shark species that have never had a history of munching on people. They did a shark culling program in Hawaii in the 1960s and early '70s, and 4,668 sharks were killed. Only 554 were the targeted species, the tiger shark. If a judge put one criminal along with eight innocent people on death row for a murder, would that be justice? And what if the guilty criminal was found guilty only because he belonged to the same race as the suspect in the crime? This type of rationale doesn't make sense, and it surely doesn't do anything to solve the crime. White sharks, by most scientific studies, have been shown not to be territorial. The shark that attacked Ben Linden is very probably hundreds of miles away, quite possibly in the waters of another country. The odds of a culling program capturing the same animal responsible for any one of the attacks is very slim. Sharks, the dominant predators in the sea, by nature need to be on the move to be efficient eaters. The element of surprise is their weapon of choice, and if they hang in the same area for too long the fish get spooked and they lose out on an easy meal. Moving ensures a more efficient way of consuming food. Great whites tracked off of Australia's northwestern coast have been known to travel to South Africa, and have been recorded traveling more than 12,000 miles in just nine months. China bans shark fin soup from banquets . In Australia, the great white is protected by both domestic and international law, having been cited as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1996. In 2002, with input from scientists, environmentalists, fisheries, and fishermen, Australia's government initiated the White Shark Recovery Plan. This law took a long time to be put into place, and undoing it would jeopardize the marine ecosystem. Any marine biologist will tell you that a healthy shark population equals a healthy marine ecosystem. Sharks predate dinosaurs, and millions of years of evolution have positioned them in a critical and vital role as an apex predator. Predator removal can cause a cascading effect that destabilizes the entire marine food web and, in turn, our oceans. Great whites are slow to mature and have very few offspring, so any type of culling program, even if done for a limited amount of time, would put their existence in peril. From what I have learned about Ben Linden, his entire life revolved around the ocean. So does mine. And so do those of millions of other people across the globe who surf, fish, swim, dive and feel more comfortable in water than on land. The ocean is a complex web of marine life, with many species being driven to extinction year after year. For humans and sharks to coexist is for us to respect their place on Earth.

"(CNN) -- Two concerned mothers have been all over TV screens recently, but unlike most of the mothers who have made appearances on TV of late, they are not concerned about health care reform. Kate Gosselin, here smiling at a press event in April, has been making the talk show rounds. ""Jon & Kate Plus 8's"" Kate Gosselin -- minus estranged husband Jon and the kids -- did a teary interview with Meredith Vieira on NBC's ""Today"" last week; and on Wednesday, Fox will air a two-hour special featuring Nadya ""Octomom"" Suleman, the single California woman who gave birth to octuplets in January. Suleman and Gosselin have already received more than their proverbial 15 minutes of fame -- so should the media, particularly the news media, continue to fill the airwaves with stories and interviews of these two women? Howard Kurtz posed this question to a panel of media experts Sunday on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" Lisa Bloom, a CNN legal analyst, said the media may be feeding a public appetite for these stories, but not without a price.  Watch the debate over the TV moms » . ""How sad, really, that there's this insatiable appetite among American news consumers for stories like that -- about people's shortcomings. Is this the first time somebody has had a divorce, or in Octomom's case, is this the first time that somebody has been a lousy parent?"" Bloom asked. ""We are fiddling while Rome burns, covering these stories ad nauseam."" David Zurawik, television and media critic for The Baltimore Sun, said there is a legitimate sociological debate occurring about why there is public interest in these ""characters,"" and why the media continue to cover them. ""That's not enough just that [the audience cares] about them,"" Zurawik said. ""But here's what's going on with Kate Gosselin, at least. People are judging their own lives. They're judging themselves as parents. They're judging themselves as wives. They're judging themselves as families against her. And that's really important. ""Look,"" he continued, ""she is the most talked-about, the most discussed representation or image of motherhood on American television. Think back to the '50s, with Barbara Billingsley from 'Leave It to Beaver' and all those books and dissertations are written about them. We should care about her."" Zurawik said critics of the coverage are voicing ""a nice high-minded argument for Sunday morning TV."" Gosselin, who also appeared on ""Live! with Regis & Kelly"" on Thursday, has her fair share of critics, particularly in the tabloid media (who have, nevertheless, been willing to follow her every move). However, few mothers have been criticized more in the press than Nadya Suleman. Suleman, who gave birth to octuplets January as a result of being implanted with six embryos, has a total of 14 children under the age of 8. News of her collecting public assistance for some of her children outraged many taxpayers. Suleman has not been portrayed as a sympathetic figure in the press, but could the ""Octomom"" special on Fox do anything to turn her image around? Lola Ogunnaike, a popular culture reporter, is skeptical. ""I doubt it. I highly doubt it. I think that she's hoping that this will, in many ways, lead to something even bigger. But people really do see her as a villain,"" Ogunnaike said. ""Fox is also banking on that, and that's why they didn't actually give her a full reality series. They're sort of testing the waters with this show and seeing -- if she does, indeed, draw ratings."" Bloom said she has personal experience in trying to get what she believes are important stories about people in remote countries on the air, only to be passed over for tabloid stories. ""I have personally pitched stories like the Cambodian war crimes tribunal. ... That's an important legal story. You can't get those stories on the air,"" she said. ""Why? Because we want stories with sex, with bad parents, with people like Octomom."" Kurtz asked if either ""Octomom"" or the ""Jon & Kate Plus 8"" sagas could fade from the media spotlight after Gosselin and Suleman's TV shows this week. Ogunnaike said the opposite is likely true. ""There could be more, unfortunately,"" she said.","CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" focused on Kate Gosselin, Nadya Suleman coverage .

"Rome (CNN) -- Vatican workmen scaled the roof of the Sistine Chapel Saturday, as they installed the chimney which will release the black or white smoke that signifies whether a new pope has been elected. The chimney is the first publicly visible sign of the preparations going on inside the chapel, which is where the Roman Catholic cardinals will gather on Tuesday for the start of the conclave -- the secret papal election. Footage released by the Vatican has shown the installation of two stoves inside the chapel. One is used to burn the cardinals' ballots after they are cast and the other to send up the smoke signal. If no one has won, a chemical is added to make the smoke black. This lets people waiting in St. Peter's Square below -- and the people watching on TV around the world -- know what is happening. White smoke means a new pope has been chosen. If the smoke is released after dark, a spotlight will be trained on the chimney so that it can still be seen, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said Saturday. The stove will be tested before the conclave to make sure it can produce smoke, Lombardi said, but privately, so as not to cause too much excitement. The cardinals met Saturday morning for the latest in a series of sessions known as General Congregations. These are open to all the cardinals, not just those aged under 80, and are an important part of the preparations for the election. As well as getting to know their counterparts from around the world, the cardinals discuss the major issues facing the church, including its handling of allegations of child sex abuse by priests and a scandal over leaks from the Vatican last year that revealed claims of corruption, as well as the church's future direction. The final General Congregation will take place on Monday, the Vatican said. More than 130 cardinals have already spoken at the meetings. Once the conclave starts, the 115 cardinal-electors can't leave Vatican City until the process is done and aren't allowed to speak with anyone outside of the conclave. They stay in a Vatican hotel, Casa Santa Marta, for the duration and, in line with tradition, drew lots for their rooms during Saturday's meeting. 'Praying a lot' The cardinal-electors will move into Santa Marta first thing on Tuesday, the Vatican said. They will then attend a special morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. The first vote will be held that afternoon, with subsequent ballots cast over the following days until one of the contenders gains the two-thirds majority that means he is elected head of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. The longest conclave held since the turn of the 20th century lasted five days. The Sistine Chapel, whose famous ceiling was painted by Renaissance artist Michelangelo, has been closed to tourists while the preparations for the conclave are made. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, one of about a dozen leading candidates to become pope, wrote in a blog post Friday that he misses New York after 10 days and is sorry he won't be there on St. Patrick's Day. ""We cardinals sure are praying a lot,"" he said. Contrary to media reports, he said, the focus of the cardinals' meetings is much the same as it was two millenia ago, namely: ""How most effectively to present the Person, message, and invitation of Jesus to a world that, while searching for salvation and eternal truth, are also at times doubting, skeptical, too busy, or frustrated."" This means discussions on such subjects as preaching, teaching the faith, care of the poor and sick, and support for the church's clergy and the families that make up their congregations, Dolan said. ""Those are the 'big issues.' You may find that hard to believe, since the 'word on the street' is that all we talk about is corruption in the Vatican, sexual abuse, money. Do these topics come up? Yes! Do they dominate? No!"" he wrote. Ring destroyed . Meanwhile, the Italian press is full of speculation about which cardinal may win enough support from his counterparts to be elected, and what regional alliances are being formed. The United States has 11 of the 115 votes, making it the second largest national bloc after Italy. Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said Saturday that the symbolic Fisherman's Ring and the seal that Benedict XVI used as pope have been scratched to render them invalid. Three other symbols of Benedict XVI's papacy were destroyed in the same way, he said. The next pope will get a new Fisherman's Ring and seal with his own name on it after he is elected. Benedict XVI resigned 10 days ago, becoming the first pontiff to do so in six centuries. CNN's Dan Rivers and Richard Allen Greene reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","Vatican: The papal ring and seal belonging to Benedict XVI have now been destroyed .

"(CNN) -- The founder of a French company that made controversial breast implants has gone on trial, accused of fraud and causing involuntary injury. Proceedings against Jean Claude Mas, who founded Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, and four others connected to the company continued Thursday, a day after the trial opened in Marseille. A woman claimant in the case told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that she hoped to be able to speak during the trial ""to make him (Mas) understand all he's made us suffer, everything we've felt in the past three years because of him."" Mas has consistently denied any wrongdoing, insisting that his products were perfectly safe. He was arrested in January of last year in connection with an investigation after the 2010 cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants. An estimated 300,000 women in 65 countries received breast implants from the company. The implants were banned in 2010, and the company went bankrupt later that year. The implants are not approved for use in the United States. The French government said last year that it would pay for the removal of PIP implants for women in France.

"(CNN) -- Authors Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman have made a habit of slaying the sacred cows of parenting in their writing on child development. The pair made headlines two years ago in ""NurtureShock"" -- their first book together -- in which they criticized the way many parents choose to raise their children. Bronson and Merryman have just released their newest work, ""Top Dog."" In two interviews, they shared some thoughts with me on strategies parents should follow to best ensure their offspring are (broadly defined) winners, not losers. I imagine many parents will find validation in their advice, while others may argue their definition of success is far too narrow. Please use the comment section below to discuss your take. How do you measure your child's success? Q: You say parents have a common misconception about their role raising children. Can you explain that? Bronson: Parenting is not just about safety and security. It's about expanding your child's comfort zone. For example, a child needs to know he or she is safe, but after that, it's OK for a parent to make their son or daughter feel unstable. Meaning, children have to get used to the frustration and jealousy that come from competition. Q: What do you mean exactly? Merryman: We have placed too much focus on the importance of comforting children. There are still too many soccer teams that don't keep score and give trophies to every player. Kids aren't fooled when adults don't keep score. They know exactly who got what goal and who missed. Q: Why is competition so important? Merryman: Research says what makes an individual successful is the development of agency. Agency is that inherent belief in yourself -- the ability to have a vision and know you can go for it. The alternative is to look over your shoulder to get your friends' approval. Bronson: Healthy competition also teaches kids to stand up for themselves. They learn to be vocal. They learn to be comfortable getting attention. When they can be successful, competition also teaches children to circumvent the desire to quit. These are all precursors to what happens when they get older. Q: Not all children enjoy competition. Some kids shy away from it. What do you say to parents of these children? Bronson: Parents can wire their children so they are ready to compete. One way is to make sure you never put your child in a competition they don't have a fighting chance of winning. Merryman: Competition is not just about athletics. Competition could be a science fair or a spelling bee. In any competition, parents can help their children by asking them the right, open-ended questions: Do you need to work harder next time? What could you have done to produce a different result? The most important lesson for parents is to encourage their children to work through challenges in a problem-solving way. Bronson: Competition can also come from sibling rivalry. Q: What does that mean, though, for only children? Are they at a disadvantage? Bronson: The simple answer is yes. Q: Is there anything parents of only children can do to counter the vacuum of not having a sibling to compete with at home? Bronson: Parents of only children should focus on group play. Instead of having one kid over for a play date, have two, or four, or more. This doesn't mean parents always have to approach play dates this way. It's not a rule they have to follow. It's simply important to know about. It's a great way to supplement what may already be working in a family. Q: What are some of the gender differences you've discovered? What do parents of girls need to know? Merryman: Girls tend to develop friendships in pairs and believe relationships are threatened when there are winners and losers. Because of this, girls tend to play games that encourage taking turns, that foster sharing, that encourage feeling equal to one another. It's especially important for parents of girls to make sure their daughters have enough competition in their lives. Bronson: Girls can also get competitive experiences just by playing in groups at home. Instead of having one girlfriend come over to play, invite a few. Q: What should parents know about their sons? Merryman: Since boys grow up in groups, they live in an environment that automatically encourages competition and differences of opinion and ability. The challenge with boys is that they're overconfident and they don't pay attention to the likelihood of being successful. They ignore odds. Parents can help boys by teaching them to understand competition better -- that often winning will only come from working hard, not just showing up. Q: Finally, to raise a ""Top Dog,"" what's the worst mistake a parent can make? Merryman: Doing too much for your kid and protecting children from failure. Bronson: Parents who think they're helping their children by keeping them safe from losing may be inadvertently creating kids who are less capable of competing as adults. Parents must allow their children to fail. Children should be given the opportunity to connect the dots between winning and losing and that winning takes effort. Do you agree that ""Parenting is not just about safety and security?"" Share your take in the comments section below.","Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman write about the science of child rearing .

"(CNN) -- Voices across the political spectrum are debating how to prevent mass shootings such as the one in Newtown, Connecticut. Familiar ideological lines are being redrawn. Some want to renew the ban on assault weapons and expand waiting periods to buy a gun. Others want to place armed guards in schools. And then there is the challenge of preventing guns from falling into the hands of the mentally ill. While the debate rages on, it's worth thinking out of the box for a moment. What if we could design guns to be smarter and safer -- with hardware and software? The right technology could neutralize the killing capability of an assault weapon, even in a madman's hands. The root of the problem is that guns are ""dumb."" Pull the trigger and they discharge bullets mindlessly, regardless of who is doing the aiming or where they are aimed. Guns should ""know"" not to fire in schools, churches, hospitals or malls. They should sense when they are being aimed at a child, or at a person when no other guns are nearby. Hardware fixes alone -- such as a ban on extended clips -- may mitigate carnage in an assault, but they will not change the risk that an event happens at all if the person holding the gun wants to harm others. Addressing that challenge with reliable precision requires a hardware and software solution. Many complex products have been transformed by safety-enhancing technology. Look at airplanes, which have layers of computer-controlled safety features to temper pilot error. Cars, increasingly, have sophisticated controls to override drivers and avoid collisions. Guns, too, can benefit from technological advances. Opinion: Take politics out of gun research . After the Newtown shooting, a number of Silicon Valley leaders signed the ""Demand a Plan"" petition for new gun laws. It is good to know how strongly they feel about tougher regulation. It would be even better if they would invest their know-how and wealth to create a new kind of gun control -- the software kind. How might this work? Start with locational ""self-awareness."" Guns should know where they are and if another gun is nearby. Global positioning systems can meet most of the need, refining a gun's location to the building level, even within buildings. Control of the gun would remain in the hand of the person carrying it, but the ability to fire multiple shots in crowded areas or when no other guns are present would be limited by software that understands where the gun is being used. Guns should also be designed to sense where they are being aimed. Artificial vision and optical sensing technology can be adapted from military and medical communities. Sensory data can be used by built-in software to disable firing if the gun is pointed at a child or someone holding a child. Building software into guns need not affect gun owners' desire to protect their homes. Trigger control software could be relaxed when the gun is at home or in a car, while other safety features stay on to prevent accidental discharges. Guns used by the police would be exempt from such controls. Finally, guns should be designed to broadcast their location when they are loaded. Police could see if high-powered assault weapons are entering or getting close to a public place. Gun owners, too, could choose to broadcast their guns' locations publicly to increase deterrent effect. Couldn't gun software be hacked? Perhaps, but the risk can be reduced by open-sourcing code, requiring software patch downloads, and notifying gun makers or law enforcement if software is disabled. Open-sourcing code is not foolproof, but it will build a community of lawful gun owners and code writers who value safety and Second Amendment rights. Enabling two-way communication between guns and their original makers will help guns to be tracked beyond the initial sale, putting greater long-term responsibility on gun makers. Developing gun software and hardware adaptations could be hastened through a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency-style program. This Defense Department agency tries to solve difficult warfare challenges with cutting-edge ideas. It gave us GPS, among other things. In the private sector, rewards can be offered for specific technological achievements, such as what the X Prize Foundation has been doing. Gun makers, gun retailers, even the National Rifle Association could underwrite a similar prize. Gun software could be phased in, starting with the most lethal assault rifles. Today's guns are componentized, creating possibilities for a vibrant aftermarket, with add-ons tested and certified by a consortium of gun makers or responsible gun owners. Technology cannot end depravity or violence, but it can limit the evil a person can inflict on others. After this latest heart-wrenching massacre, enacting new laws may help us feel like we have done something. But smarter technology may actually do a lot more. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeremy Shane.","Jeremy Shane advocates changing the way guns work with ""smart"" technology .

"Oklahoma City (CNN) -- Some 300 mourners crowded inside Eagle Heights Baptist Church here Friday to pay their respects to an elementary school student killed when a tornado churned through nearby Moore, Oklahoma. ""It is hard to believe someone 8 years old can fill up a church like this,"" said Landon House, a soccer coach . A coffin adorned with soccer jerseys and a spray of flowers shaped like a soccer ball held the body of Kyle Davis, a soccer fanatic at Plaza Towers Elementary School, which was razed by the storm Monday. He was a force on the soccer field. His stocky build earned him a nickname: ""The Wall."" Read more about the victims . ""Kids just bounced off of him,"" Davis' grandfather Marvin Dixon said Wednesday. ""He just loved being with his Pawpaw and I loved being with him. I'm just going to miss him."" Kyle was among 24 people -- 10 of them children -- who lost their lives Monday when a massive tornado hit Moore. Seven children died at Plaza Towers Elementary School. His teacher in kindergarten and second grade struggled to maintain her composure. ""Kyle was always a thoughtful child in my classroom,"" said Emily Eischen, who likened the ""little blue-eyed, blond-hair boy"" to her own son. ""My heart aches."" Davis had attended a different church, but the number of attendees required a larger facility. Two hours before the funeral began, the church parking lot was already full. Dozens of children wore soccer uniforms in support of their fallen teammate. Many of those who spoke during the service cited Kyle's love of soccer and reputation for doling out hugs to anyone willing to accept them. A soccer ball was passed around for attendees to sign. His family wore jerseys bearing Kyle's number, 16, and a local soccer group announced it would retire that number as a gesture of support. ""A coach receives as much from the kids as the kids receive from the coach,"" said Josh White, who coached Kyle. ""I saw miracles in action. Thank you for letting me witness the miracle of Kyle."" The Rev. Dewayne Klepper said Kyle's last words to his mother were, ""I love you, Mama.""

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- The competitive spirit between Australia and New Zealand rarely dims, but New Zealand has sprinted ahead of its trans-Tasman rival to become the first country in the Asia Pacific region to legalize same-sex marriage. The move has left Australia's gay community feeling behind in terms of gay rights. The New Zealand Parliament passed legislation with a convincing 77 to 44 vote amending the Marriage Act to permit gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual and intersex couples to marry. The vote caused the supporting New Zealand lawmakers to erupt into applause and an overjoyed public gallery to burst into song. The lawmaker responsible for the bill, Louisa Wall, thanked her female partner as she grasped a bouquet of rainbow-colored flowers. ""Nothing could make me prouder to be a New Zealander than passing this bill,"" Wall said. Meanwhile in Australia, the rainbow symbol -- long associated with gay activism -- has taken on a more militant meaning with a social media-fuelled rainbow revolution underway in which activists across Australia have been ""chalking"" the colors of the rainbow in public spaces. The nationwide protest was triggered by a New South Wales government decision to remove a rainbow-painted pedestrian crossing in the city's gay heartland. Painted at a cost of 110,000 Australian dollars, and with the permission of the authorities during the last Sydney Mardi Gras in March, it was ordered to be removed by the state's roads minister, Duncan Gay, soon after the partying ended. Gay said removing the crossing, at a cost of 30,000 Australian dollars, was necessary because it was a distraction to drivers and posed safety risks. The move gave rise to a Facebook protest page that garnered widespread support and surprised even its instigator, James Brechney. ""I just thought it would be really funny to put on Facebook, I thought I'd get 50 Likes on my wall,"" Brechney told News Limited. Shops have reported depleted stocks of chalk as hundreds of rainbow crossings have appeared across the country, including small towns. The phenomenon, meanwhile, has spread worldwide. Rainbow crossings have appeared in London, Los Angeles, New York, Singapore, Vancouver, Berlin and Nairobi. But the chalk protest and the vote in New Zealand Parliament have not moved Australian politicians. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she couldn't see Australia following New Zealand, although she has permitted a conscience vote on a same-sex bill when it was debated and failed last year. ''I doubt we're going to end up agreeing,'' she told a member of the public at a community cabinet meeting in Melbourne. Gillard believes marriage is an act between a man and a woman. She has, however, said she would allow another conscience vote and has urged the opposition Coalition leader Tony Abbott to do likewise. Although several Coalition frontbenchers support it, Coalition lawmakers were denied a conscience vote during last year's same-sex marriage bill vote. Abbott, like Prime Minister Gillard, remains unmoved by New Zealand's decision. 'We had a parliamentary vote on this just a few months ago ... and it was fairly decisively rejected,"" he said. While Australia's political leaders have not been swayed, New Zealand's vote has given new hope to Australia's gay community. Australian Marriage Equality national convener, Rodney Croome, said the New Zealand move could be a 'game changer' because Australia and its nearest neighbor are so culturally inter-linked. ""Growing international pressure takes it up a notch,"" Croome said. ""Those Australians who support this reform will be inspired and encouraged to redouble our efforts in trying to achieve this for Australia,"" he said. Croome said the fact conservative New Zealand Prime Minister John Key allowed his parliamentary colleagues a conscience vote and voted for the law himself, could change the political appetite for reform in Australia. ""It sends a direct message that this is an issue conservatives can support. It will increase support for a conscience vote despite what Tony Abbott says,"" Croome said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if there's a push for a conscience vote before the election,"" he added. Croome predicts thousands of Australian gay couples will begin to make their way across the Tasman to marry because the New Zealand legislation does not limit the right to marry to residents. ""They'll be returning to Australia to find that their solemn vows of lifelong commitment are not recognized in Australian law. They will be one of the important catalysts for change in this country,"" he told CNN. Nevertheless, he said he won't be amongst those leaving Australia to tie the knot. ""I want to marry in my home state, Tasmania,"" he said. The benefit to the New Zealand economy is expected to be big. Croome's Australians Marriage Equality lobby estimates it will be in the order of 700 million Australian dollars while Chris McKellar of Gay Tourism New Zealand believes it will be worth between 150 and 160 million Australian dollars. ""New Zealand is set to reap a massive economic dividend from the wedding-spend of those Australian same-sex couples who are tired of their country's failure to act,"" Croome said. Australian census statistics show that some 1,300 gay couples had traveled to Canada and Argentina to take advantage of same-sex marriage laws. A sizeable proportion of couples using New Zealand's civil union law since it was passed in 2005, have been Australian too.","New Zealand Parliament votes 77 to 44 to allow same-sex couples to marry .

"(CNN) -- There are many unanswered questions about the motivations of the alleged Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. But it is becoming increasingly clear that they were inspired by faith in a radical Islamist ideology. Dzhokhar has told investigators that, among other things, he and his brother wanted to defend Islam, while Tamerlan's social media accounts are replete with clips by extremist clerics. As the investigation continues to unravel the seeming paradox of how two apparently normal young men could commit acts of violence, classmates, neighbors and relatives of those who knew them have expressed surprise and disbelief. I have interviewed over the past seven years more than a hundred radical extremists, including numerous al Qaeda and Taliban members, and it appears the Tsarnaev brothers fit the profile of many young men who turn to radicalism. Young men—and they are almost always between the ages of 16 and 30—who convert to the radical Islamist cause come from a variety of socioeconomic and family circumstances. Before their conversion (and even often after), to all outward appearances they resemble their peers and seem like any other young men. What changes them? While their friends, the Internet, or clerics may provide the spark or ostensible reason for radicalization, almost all these young men have some kind of deep and often hidden personal crisis in their lives that propels them to seek the all-encompassing, comprehensive answers that the radical Islamist ideology offers. This belief system can elevate lost individuals into a greater collective, convincing them that they are carrying out the will of God for their own glory and the redemption of Muslims everywhere. Imbued with that conviction, the young men believe they are serving the cause of God, performing good deeds in the world, and that their own lives suddenly have meaning. They consider themselves at last on the correct path in life. Repeatedly in my interviews, the surface reasons these men joined the cause, such as perceived American hostility to Islam or the American involvement in Iraq or Afghanistan, often masked a personal sense of alienation and individual crisis that gripped their lives, from a failed love affair or family conflict to not being able to relate to their peers. The radical Islam cause provides the relief from their crisis. It serves as the easy outlet to unleash their demons. They can now achieve a greater glory. Their lives now matter. They can become overnight heroes, featured in the media, endowed with fame and celebrated among their small, closed circle—either online or among fellow believers. Whether the Tsarnaev brothers were self-radicalized through the Internet or by other individuals in the United States or overseas, they tapped into a belief system that feeds on vulnerable young men. It is this radical interpretation of Islam and its ideology—which demonizes nonbelievers and creates an exclusivist community—that poses an all too real danger and cannot be defeated by force of arms alone. I met many young men who ended up leaving the radical movement. The reason each of them left centered on their own realization that al Qaeda and others were engaged in corruption or deception and did not represent true Islam. As we search for the most effective responses to Islamist radicalism, we would do well to remember that the answers ultimately must come from those who follow the faith. The United States can play a constructive role. The radical Islamist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, whose sermons can be found on the Internet, is still influential. U.S. authorities killed al-Awlaki with a drone strike in Yemen in 2011. If the United States put in effort to expose the fact that the cleric had been arrested for soliciting prostitutes -- a violation of Islamic precepts -- his standing among young men looking for an example of Islam could be diminished. Ideas drive the radical Islamist movement. Ideas can defeat it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Ballen.","Ken Ballen: The alleged Boston Marathon bombers were influenced by Islamic ideology .

"(CNN) -- Anthony Weiner's long-anticipated official announcement that he's running for mayor of New York City began with a slight glitch this week: A video announcing his candidacy was posted on YouTube in the middle of the night, then yanked off the site -- and eventually posted again. The two-minute video did exactly what it was intended to do: launch Weiner 2.0, promoting him as an earnest family man bursting with energy, ideas and promise, and offering to lead New York City as its chief executive. But the stutter-step in the timing is a metaphor for Weiner's relationship to media. It remains to be seen whether the same digital platforms that catapulted him to national prominence -- and later proved to be his undoing -- will end up being a blessing, a curse, or a distraction as Weiner joins a crowded race for City Hall. There's no question that Weiner has media star power that far outstrips his half-dozen or so Democratic rivals. For years, he was a fixture on cable news programs, ready with quips, strategic insight, and fighting words fired at adversaries on the floor of Congress. But almost exactly two years ago, the shadow side of Weiner's media life emerged, when the then-congressman mistakenly blasted a lewd photo to his thousands of Twitter followers. His conservative enemies pounced on the image and soon discovered -- and trumpeted to the world -- that Weiner was sending lascivious texts and photos to women around the country, some from his office on Capitol Hill. After a short period in which he told outrageous lies about the photos, claiming his computer was hacked, Weiner quit Congress and dropped out of public life. He now says that the six women with whom he's known to have exchanged randy messages -- and the lies he told about it -- represent the sum total of his misbehavior. That may be true, although New York's political insiders generally assume more photos could emerge in the weeks ahead. But the incident leaves Weiner as a strange media hybrid -- a star nationally, but an uprooted local candidate facing formidable challenges in his hometown. The national press finds him irresistible, with conservatives eager to bash him and liberals hoping to rehabilitate him. His wife, Huma Abedin, is a glamorous, globally famous personality in her own right, having served at the right hand of former Secretar of State Hillary Clinton. The couple moved from Weiner's working-class apartment in Queens -- he happened to quit as New York's congressional boundaries were being redrawn, and his district was simply eliminated. Weiner now lives in a luxury building on Park Avenue in Manhattan, where paparazzi lie in wait to snap photos nearly every time he leaves the house. To most New York politicians, such obsessive media attention would be considered a gift from the gods. But it's a double-edged sword for Weiner. At the same time he was electrifying left-leaning audiences on national TV, Weiner was building a reputation in New York City as a centrist Democrat arguing for tax cuts and other relief for working-class New Yorkers. The son of a public school teacher and a lawyer, he made much of his middle-class roots and vowed to bring gritty, neighborhood-based values to city hall. In local politics, that remains Weiner's central persona: a working-class truth teller, willing to ruffle feathers and challenge liberal orthodoxy. But it's hard to make that argument from Park Avenue, and Weiner's opponents seldom fail to mention his luxury digs, which are very much at odds with his persona as spokesman for the forgotten middle class. No other candidate in the race comes close to having Weiner's years of experience in delivering talking points on camera, debating one-on-one and packaging complex policies in short, comprehensible bites. But New York City mayoral contests aren't decided on TV or Twitter. Residents like to see their candidates up close and personal, in literally hundreds of meetings of political clubs, church basements, block associations and the like. Weiner has always been effective on the stump, but it remains to be seen how he'll be greeted. His video announcement was, among other things, a way to control his image. As he makes the rounds of debates, forums and other places where New Yorkers are known to give candidates an unscripted piece of their mind, we'll see if Weiner 2.0 will sell in the parts of New York that the national talking heads rarely visit. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","Errol Louis: Anthony Weiner launched his mayoral candidacy, touting, ideas promise .

"(CNN) -- Fresh accusations that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war have led many to renew calls for the world to take stronger actions to stop the growing humanitarian crisis. But recent polls have shown Americans are very reluctant to support military interventions in Syria. In a Huffington Post/YouGov poll, as few as 5% of respondents were willing to commit troops to the cause. The Obama administration has been similarly hesitant to get involved in Syria. Q&A: Is Syrian war escalating to wider conflict? While the administration has made some efforts to respond to humanitarian crises elsewhere in the world -- the U.S. joined NATO in its successful mission to assist Libyan rebels, military advisers have been sent to Uganda to combat the Lord's Resistance Army and to Jordan to help Syrian rebels -- full-scale military intervention in Syria does not appear to be on the table. Read more: Opposition source -- Syrian rebels get U.S.-organized training in Jordan . President Obama's varying view on humanitarian intervention is in keeping with over 20 years of inconsistent American policy on the issue. Over the last 20 years, the U.S. government has chosen to intervene in Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Haiti, and Libya while resisting calls to take action in Rwanda and Sudan. Read more: 5 reasons Syria's war suddenly looks more dangerous . To better predict whether the U.S. will intervene in Syria, or any other similar crisis, we must understand why Washington selectively engages in humanitarian intervention missions. Our recent research on when and why the U.S. engages in humanitarian intervention emphasizes two factors that might force the U.S. government's hand on humanitarian intervention: public opinion and Congressional partisanship. We analyzed public opinion polls and congressional votes during four episodes of humanitarian intervention -- Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo -- and found, as recent debates seems to suggest, humanitarian intervention is mired in the mundane world of politics. Contrary to conventional wisdom, politics do not end at ""water's edge."" There is some good news to report: both the general public and individual legislators understand and are responsive to the moral imperative of stopping humanitarian crises. The public is generally supportive of humanitarian missions. Even in the recent polls on Syria, respondents believe something should be done, even if they are unsupportive of military action by the U.S.. Opinion: Give peace talks in Syria a chance . Further, Congress is not wholly unresponsive to public preferences regarding intervention in humanitarian emergencies. Legislative support is more likely in cases where public opinion generally favors intervention. Those who push for more humanitarian missions can increase support for such missions by raising public outcry for action. But the bad news is that humanitarian crises, like in Syria, which should rise above politics as usual, are often mired in that very spot. Opinion: Why the Syrian quagmire threatens Turkey . Although public opinion appears to have an influence on legislative behavior, traditional factors such as partisanship have the strongest influence on how legislators cast their votes. Humanitarian intervention is most likely when the U.S. president enjoys a majority in Congress. In the case of the 1990s, humanitarian interventions failed to get off the ground when President Clinton lost majorities in Congress. If American politics is becoming increasingly partisan, future administrations should have an even harder time galvanizing the domestic support they need to address any humanitarian crises. Opinion: Obama's no-win options in Syria . This does not mean, however, that humanitarian intervention will only occur when a president enjoys a majority in Congress. As the recently launched humanitarian missions suggest, politicians are learning the lessons of the 1990s and circumventing Congress. This helps explain why President Obama's decision to contribute the U.S. military to NATO operations in Libya proceeded without Congressional authorization; the president was surely aware that such a vote would go down to defeat in a Republican-controlled House and deeply partisan Senate. Congress was similarly bypassed in October 2011 when the administration deployed military advisers to Uganda. Congress was similarly bypassed in 2011 and 2013 when the administration deployed military advisers to Uganda and Jordan, respectively. For those who advocate for a strong humanitarian intervention in Syria, our research does not paint a completely gloomy picture. Instead, it simply suggests that domestic political will is a necessary precondition for intervention missions and should not be overlooked. It is important to recognize that partisan bickering and political jockeying shape responses to humanitarian crises just as in trade policy, arms control, and immigration politics. While the atrocities are singular in their importance, the politics of dealing with them are not. For those eager to craft a uniform and effective international response to humanitarian crises as in Syria, they must first turn their attention to domestic politics. The political elites who must decide when, whether, where and how to fulfill the responsibility to protect, face their own domestic political battles. Ignoring these contexts threatens to over-simplify both the problems and the promises of humanitarian intervention. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Hildebrandt, Courtney Hillebrecht and Jon Pevehouse.","Experts: Washington selectively engages in humanitarian intervention missions .

"(CNN) -- If you take Jeff Bezos' word for it, Amazon's new Kindle Fire HD is ""the best tablet at any price."" Bold claim. And it's an obvious reaction to the reviews of last year's first-generation Kindle Fire, which praised the $199 price but made it clear you're getting the substandard tablet experience you just paid next to nothing for. This year, Amazon has a new Kindle Fire called the Kindle Fire HD that's a noticeable improvement over the original. But is it the ""best tablet at any price""? Nope. If you read the reviews, including mine, you'll quickly learn Bezos seems to have adopted the ""reality distortion field"" that Steve Jobs was famous for. Does that mean the Kindle Fire HD is horrible? No. Not at all. In fact, it's still a decent option if you don't want to shell out $500 or more on an iPad. But how is Amazon able to make a good tablet at such a cheap price? Simple. Like Amazon.com, the Kindle Fire HD is built to find ways to sell you more stuff. First, and most annoyingly of all, the Kindle Fire HD displays full-color ads on its lock screen. That means every time you switch the device on, you see an ad for stuff like a Kindle e-book, a movie download, music from Amazon's MP3 store and the like. Amazon told me you'll also see a lot of third-party ads for products outside Amazon's ecosystem. The good news is, if the ads really bother you, you can pay $15 to Amazon after you purchase the device to remove them for good. But Amazon didn't stop with the ads. When you're using the tablet, you're constantly inundated with suggestions to check out more Amazon products. The most blatant example of this is on the Kindle Fire HD's home screen. Whenever you hover over an app, movie, song or book, there's a section at the bottom of the screen that suggests other apps, movies, songs or books that you might want to buy. Do you like playing Angry Birds? Buy Cut the Rope! Do you like listening to Nicki Minaj? Check out Katy Perry's latest album! You get the idea. It's nearly identical to the way Amazon's website suggests items to you when you're shopping around. These ads and suggested items are a clever way for Amazon to continue to drive value out of you months and months after you buy the Kindle Fire HD. And it's completely antithetical to your typical tablet experience. Tablets are supposed to be computing devices, helping you browse the Web, check e-mail, manage your calendar and the like. Yes, they make it easy to buy new content, but on devices like the iPad and Google's Nexus 7, you're not constantly pushed to do so. But Amazon doesn't see it that way. It's just another portal to get you to buy. When you buy a Kindle Fire HD, it doesn't feel like your tablet. It feels like Amazon's. Is this a dealbreaker? No way.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York hardware clerk who pleaded guilty to abducting, smothering and dismembering an 8-year-old boy was sentenced Wednesday to 40 years to life behind bars on charges of second degree murder and kidnapping in the second degree. As part of a plea deal, Levi Aron will be eligible for parole after 40 years, though could serve life in prison. Aron was accused of snatching Leiby Kletzky last summer from the Brooklyn boy's neighborhood. His attorney, Howard Greenberg, said he asked for protective custody for Aron ""because there are a lot of sick and demented people."" The ""sentence was 40 years, not life."" The plea deal was announced in early August and at the time Aron's attorney, Jennifer L. McCann, said she was ""glad we were able to come up with an amenable resolution that both sides agreed to."" Police say Leiby's dismembered body was found in Aron's freezer and inside a suitcase in a nearby trash bin. New York City's chief medical examiner said the Brooklyn boy was drugged before he was slain. The autopsy results for Leiby listed a cocktail of four prescription and over-the-counter drugs in the boy's system: cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant; quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug; hydrocodone, a pain medication; and acetaminophen, the drug in Tylenol. Both Aron and Leiby were members of the borough's close-knit Orthodox Jewish community, although police say it doesn't appear that they knew each other. Kletzky's family released a statement saying they have ""finally received some partial closure on one aspect of this nightmare.""

"(CNN) -- All the talk this season has been that Robin van Persie is the difference between winning the English Premier League title, or not. Roberto Mancini wanted to sign him after his Manchester City side won a first championship in 44 years on the final day of the 2011-12 campaign. Much to his chagrin, even the deep pockets of the club's Abu Dhabi owners could not tempt the Dutchman. Even worse for the Italian, and for Arsenal fans hoping he would stay in London, the 29-year-old decided to join Manchester United for what has proved to be a bargain initial $34 million. Having never won a title at any of his previous clubs, the striker opted for Old Trafford -- and it has paid off handsomely. His first-half hat-trick in Monday's 3-0 win over struggling Aston Villa clinched a record-extending 20th English crown for United, and put him back on top of the EPL scoring charts. While City's top scorer Carlos Tevez has 11 this season, Van Persie has 24 -- one more than Liverpool's Luis Suarez, who may miss the rest of this season after being charged with violent conduct for biting a Chelsea opponent on Sunday. ""I'm very happy but it's weird. I had to wait for so long for my first title and it's a great feeling,"" Van Persie said in a post-match interview after United moved 16 points clear of second-placed City. Two of his goals were set up by 39-year-old Ryan Giggs, who claimed his 13th EPL title since starting his career with United. The second was a spectacular volley following a lofted pass from England striker Wayne Rooney, which virtually ended the game as a contest as early as the 13th minute. ""It was a great ball from Wayne, so the only thing I had to do was guide it right and hit it properly and it went in great,"" said the Netherlands international, whose efforts this season will cost United an extra $2 million in add-on fees. He went 10 games without a goal as United crashed out of the European Champions League, but has bounced back with five in the last three matches. Rooney has had to play second fiddle in the goalscoring stakes, but was able to celebrate his 400th United appearance with an impressive performance from a deeper-lying role. ""It's what we've worked all year for and we've fully deserved it. We won this game in the first half and it is a fantastic night for us,"" Rooney said. ""When you lose the title it's hard to take, and the way we did it wasn't a nice feeling last time so we've all dug in deep and all worked together and done fantastic to put ourselves in the position tonight to finish the job off."" Last season United blew an eight-point lead before surrendering the title in the final minutes as City snatched an injury-time victory. This season United did not let up, while City dropped points against lesser teams. ""You can go on and on about losing a title but at the end of the day, our consistency for the last 20 years is unbelievable,"" said United manager Alex Ferguson, who has also won 13 titles since joining in 1986. ""The focus of the team was good, they focused on the challenge of City and came up trumps."" The 71-year-old, the most successful manager since the EPL began in 1992, acknowledged the contribution of Van Persie this season. ""He's been unbelievable, his early form in the first six months was fantastic. He had the spell where he didn't score (for 10 games) but he was unbelievable tonight."" Ferguson's team can break the EPL points record held by Chelsea with victories in the club's four remaining games. ""We've now got 84 points with four games left -- we've never done that,"" he said when asked where this season's achievement ranks. ""We've won most of our games, drawn three, lost four, and the goal tonight (Van Persie's volley) ... all the great goals we've scored over the years, from David Beckham through Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Eric Cantona, that goal has joined that. These players have joined the pedestal."" While the result will likely quell any further protests against United's U.S. owners, the Glazer family -- unpopular after their highly leveraged takeover in 2005 -- the situation is not so positive for another American in charge of an EPL club. The defeat left Randy Lerner's Aston Villa three points above the relegation zone, having played one more match than the third-bottom team, Wigan. Villa manager Paul Lambert was relieved his side did not suffer a repeat of December's 8-0 defeat at Chelsea, having gone behind after just 90 seconds against United and then trailed 3-0 after 32 minutes. ""We wanted to make sure it didn't happen again. Credit to them they kept on going against a brilliant side, the best in the country,"" Lambert said. ""Congratulations to Man Utd. They have been the best team all season. They work really hard, they work for each other, they have a mentality that has been here for years and years. The best team always wins the league.""","Robin van Persie nets all three goals as Manchester United clinch English title .

"(CNN) -- Doctors say the discovery of a 4-year-old carrier of the H7N9 bird flu virus who shows no symptoms of the potentially lethal virus is a worrying development that could make the spread of the infection more difficult to monitor. The Beijing Municipal Health Bureau said the boy was detected from a group of close contacts of the first infection in Beijing and the laboratory results showed the boy was an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. The boy emerged after authorities screened 24 poultry owners in Naidong Village, Cuigezhuang County in Chaoyang District, taking throat swabs of those in contact with the group. The report said the boy's parents were engaged in poultry and fish trading. According to Dr. Leo Poon Lit-man, associate professor, School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong, while there is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from human to human, medical authorities need to be on the alert. ""It really depends on whether this H7N9 virus is transmissible between humans ... that key question needs to be answered,"" Dr. Poon told CNN. ""So far, we do not know the full spectrum of the clinical presentations of these H7N9 patients. ""In the beginning, we were only able to detect it because there were some severe cases and some people actually died. They are trying enhance the surveillance so that's we can detect those cases where there is only a mild infection."" H7N9 is normally found in birds. Until last month, it was never known to infect people. China has invited a team of international experts to assess the spread of the H7N9 bird flu virus in the country, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. A team composed of Chinese experts on epidemiology, laboratory tests and clinical treatment, as well as experts and officials from the U.S, the European Union and the WHO, ""will assess the outbreak and the response to guide further the prevention and control measures,"" Glenn Thomas, spokesman for the World Health Organization told reporters in Geneva. Poon said evidence of human-to-human transmission would put the H7N9 problem into a different category. ""If it can (transmit human to human), then it's a very different scenario -- we would not be able to detect asymptomatic carriers and that would be a huge problem,"" he said. The discovery of the carrier has meant Beijing has notched up a gear in its monitoring efforts, extending its action from a passive 'syndrome surveillance' to a more active 'pathogen monitoring'. This involves actively seeking out and targeting populations at risk from the disease. Health officials in China say there have been 77 confirmed cases of H7N9 and 16 confirmed deaths. Several cities in eastern China have suspended trading in live poultry in an effort to contain the problem.","NEW: There have been 77 confirmed cases and 16 confirmed deaths .

"(CNN) -- A 4-year-old Ohio girl who vanished more than three weeks ago was found alive and in good condition, halfway across the country in Southern California, authorities said. Haylee Donathan was found with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, fugitive sex offender Robbi Potter. Haylee Donathan, her mother, Candace Watson, and Robbi Potter were discovered after hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio. Potter is a registered sex offender, officials said. He was being sought by the U.S. Marshal's Service. Late Tuesday, Haylee was in the custody of a children's protective services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said. She was doing well but may have chicken pox, he added. ""We understand she is healthy and happy and I believe, waiting to come back to her grandmother here,"" he said.  Watch authorities announce their find » . The journey west took them more than 2,000 miles from Mansfield, the north-Central Ohio city where the girl and her mother live. ""I am very happy that my granddaughter's coming home,"" said Mary Watson, Haylee's grandmother. ""And I just want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart."" Watson, 24, and Potter, 27, were arrested without incident and held by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. When asked their reaction, Elliott said, ""I believe a little shocked that we were able to find them."" Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said. Watson's hair was a bit darker and Potter also changed his appearance slightly. Authorities had feared Haylee was endangered. Potter, a sex offender, had escaped a halfway house on May 28, the day the girl and her mother fell out of sight. Countless tips came in while they were missing but one in particular led to the breakthrough on Tuesday, Elliott said without elaborating. But a tip from members of the ranch could have led to the raid and arrest, a ranch member told CNN. Kevin Carlin, a member of the ranch in the neighborhood of Valley Center, told CNN in a telephone interview that ranch members became suspicious when a former ranch guest saw billboards urging help in finding Haylee and the two adults. Elliott also praised intense national news coverage from programs such as HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" and ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,"" as well as local media and Clear Channel, which put up missing child billboards across the country. When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said. The U.S. Marshals Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of 27-year-old Potter. Potter was wanted on a state warrant for parole violation and a federal warrant for probation violation. He is a convicted tier three sex offender, according to the U.S. Marshals Service, a unit of the Justice Department. While on the run, Potter and Watson were reportedly seen on surveillance video on May 31 at a Wal-Mart Store in Marion, Ohio, 40 miles from Mansfield. Haylee was not on that video. Adding to concerns, Watson's roommate, Samantha Covert, said last week in an interview on ""Nancy Grace"" that she saw the little girl in bed with her mother and Potter the morning they disappeared. Covert said Watson carried a basket of clothing, pillows and blankets. Watson will likely face state charges, including harboring a fugitive, according to Elliott. In addition to other charges, he said Potter may be prosecuted under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, a federal sex offender registration and self-reporting law that carries a multiyear felony sentence if violated. On its Web site, the Morning Star Ranch describes itself as ""a community of growers of organic, pesticide-free avocados, grapefruit, persimmons, nuts and other produce."" Elliot said he believed it is a rehabilitation facility and also called it a Christian retreat.","Ohio girl found alive near San Diego, California, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Don't simply saunter up to the boarding gate at a Spirit Airlines flight and think you can carry on your luggage for free. That'll cost you $100 starting Tuesday. While discount carrier Spirit Airlines makes customers pay for most carry-on and checked luggage, its customers could pay up to $100 to bring their bags if they forget to pay in advance . The airline has raised other fees as well. Carry-on baggage is now $35 if purchased during online booking ($25 for members of the airline's fare club) and $50 if purchased at the airport kiosk. Your first checked bag now costs $30 if paid during online booking ($20 for fare club member), increases to $45 if purchased at the airport kiosk and increases to $100 if you check it at the gate. You can still carry a purse, briefcase or other small personal item for free. ""Our goal is for no customer ever to pay the $100 fee,"" said Spirit Chief Operating Officer Tony Lefebvre in a statement. ""By planning ahead and paying for bags before getting to the boarding gate, our customers are saving time at the airport and speeding up the boarding process. When our customers choose these time-saving, self-service options, our costs go down, and we can pass those savings along to our customers."" Airlines making billions from fees . Spirit's fees may seem extreme to some passengers, but most airlines seem to be making money from charging for services beyond the basic ride they provide. Additional revenue is generated by ""a la carte"" services such as snacks, preferred seating, luggage fees, commissions for hotel bookings and frequent flier mile sales to partners. Airline ancillary revenue is projected to reach $36.1 billion worldwide this year, according to the Amadeus Worldwide Estimate of Ancillary Revenue, an increase of 11.3% over last year. That $36.1 billion is 5.4% of global airline revenues of $667 billion. ""As far as fees are concerned, airlines' attitude is, 'the more, the merrier,' "" said Douglas Quinby, PhoCusWright's senior director of research. ""Travelers who don't have enough mileage status to enjoy any exemptions should plan for some extra spending when planning their travel, especially if they are traveling during peak times around Thanksgiving and Christmas, when overhead bin space will be hard to come by."" Websites such as Kayak, Airfarewatchdog and FareCompare have convenient tables so travelers can plan in advance to some extent, Quinby added. Fees for 'extras' likely to continue . Will passengers see more fees in 2013? There's no end to the creativity of airlines to charge separate fees for things that used to be included in the price of a ticket, according to George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com. Allegiant now gives a discount for paying with a debit card versus a credit card, and Virgin America has charged an extra $20 on some flights for seats closer to the front of the plane with early boarding, wrote Hobica in an e-mail. ""We might even see fees scaled by distance flown. If these fees are really about fuel consumption, why should a checked bag flown 300 miles cost the same as one flown 2,500 miles? ""We may also see penalties -- er, fees -- for passengers who don't print their boarding passes, pay baggage fees and check in online before arriving at the airport,"" Hobica wrote. ""Want to deal with a human at the airport? You'll pay for that. There's no end to the imagination when it comes to new and 'improved' fee structures.""","Travelers can avoid Spirit Airlines $100 fee by paying for bags when booking flight online .

"(CNN) -- A massive dock, possibly debris from the March 2011 tsunami that struck Japan, has washed ashore in Washington state's Olympic National Park. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter spotted the dock Tuesday along a remote section of the park's coast, the Washington State Marine Debris Task Force said. Authorities were trying to reach the dock by ground Wednesday to determine whether it was tsunami debris and whether it harbors invasive species that could harm the area. The National Park Service has closed the beach in the area to the public. The Coast Guard had been searching for the dock since Friday, when a fishing vessel spotted it adrift in the ocean. Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire thanked the Coast Guard for finding the dock. ""They were out in challenging conditions looking for a needle in a haystack, and they found it,"" she said in a statement. If the dock is confirmed as tsunami debris, it would be the second to wash ashore in the Pacific Northwest this year. In June, a 66-foot-long dock turned up near Agate Beach, Oregon. In September, a 50-foot-long dock was spotted off the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Molokai. Alaska has seen much debris from the tsunami wash up on its beaches this year.","Dock lands on Olympic National Park beach in Washington state .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- While the world wallows in recession, climate change activists continue to raise alarm bells about the future of the world. So celebrate Earth Day with these 10 simple tips on how to help the environment and save money: . Earth Day on April 22, 2009 aims to raise awareness on how to reverse dangerous environmental trends. 1. Sharing is caring! In the European Union, cars are said to be responsible for almost 15 percent of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. So do your bit by joining a car pool, that will cut your travel bills and mean you can enjoy the company of other commuters, or try out an hourly car rental service like Zipcar. There are dozens of carpool Web sites around to help you find fellow commuters. 2. Glide through the waves Turn off lights and devices when you leave a room and cut your electricity bill. Unplug your cell phone charger from the wall when not using it. Just because you cannot see the electro-magnetic waves does not mean they are not frying your brain cells! To date, no study has definitively been able to show the risks between electro-magnetic waves and major health problems. But Dr. Ronald B. Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, warned last year: ""We shouldn't wait for a definitive study to come out, but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later."" 3. A road to a (farmer's) house is never long. Buy locally made products. Buying locally grown foods and goods does not just boost your local economy, but it also has a major impact on the environment. Reduced transport from trucks, boats and airplanes transporting goods can reduce carbon monoxide emissions by thousands of tons. 4. In nature's good books Who does not love the smell of weathered pages in age-old books? Save money and the forests by visiting your local library instead of buying new books. 5. Turn off the tap Congratulations for brushing your teeth for three minutes, twice a day, as per your dentist's urging. But if you care about the environment as much as you do your pearly whites, turn the tap off while brushing to save water. Do you have other tips? Tell us below in the Sound Off . 6. Good riddance to bad rubbish Go paperless. Read your favorite newspapers and magazines online. Publications are increasingly relying on advertising instead of subscriptions for revenue, meaning you can discover the latest buzz and even save some money. Also switch to electronic banking and credit card payments. It will save you time and energy. Ask your bank about how to register for online banking. If you really have to, print on both sides of the paper. 7. Come hell or high water Be a wo/man and take ""navy showers!"" Turning the water off every time you soap and shampoo will save countless liters of water. According to the World Health Organization, water scarcity affects one in three people on every continent of the globe. The situation is getting worse as needs for water rise along with population growth, urbanization and increases in household and industrial uses. Watch earth day celebrations around the world . 8. Living vintage Vintage items are all the rage, so opt for used furniture when thinking about home improvements. 9. Washing, the old-fashioned way To save water and energy and cut down on detergent entering the sewerage system, wait for a full load before using the dishwasher and washing machine. If you are hand washing the dishes or garments, try doing so in a plugged sink rather than under a running tap. 10. Grassroots all the way Use organic cleaning products such as non-toxic vinegar and baking soda. These have been proven for centuries, and can clean almost everything in the house.","On Earth Day, we give you 10 tips for saving money and the environment .

"Washington (CNN) -- Few answers have emerged to the myriad questions about the Boston Marathon bombing and its aftermath, but that didn't stop political leaders from clashing about what happened and why it did on Sunday talk shows. Republican members of Congress played up a possible connection to global terrorists and said the lone surviving suspect should be designated an enemy combatant to allow unfettered questioning and unlimited detention. Democratic legislators called for handling the 19-year-old suspect as a crime suspect rather than a war enemy, allowing the U.S. citizen the right to legal representation under federal law that could impose the death penalty. A closer look at their statements and arguments showed how politicians blend facts, conjecture and spin to push their side's agenda while countering arguments from across the aisle. The facts so far tell a still-convoluted story. Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, brothers of northern Caucasus origin who had lived in the United States for years, allegedly set off two bombs near the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 170. Graham: 'Ball was dropped' in probe of Tamerlan . After the FBI released video footage and photos of the pair on Thursday, they allegedly shot to death a university police officer and carjacked a getaway vehicle, leading to a wild chase through Boston and its suburbs that ended with Tamerlan dead and Dzhokhar on the lam. He was captured Friday night to culminate a day of door-to-door searches in an unprecedented manhunt in parts of Boston and its suburbs. With authorities still trying to nail down exactly what happened and why, the political chatter on Sunday provided more partisan posturing than solid answers. Republicans focused on a six-month trip last year to Russia and perhaps his former Dagestan homeland and other Caucusus regions by Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the elder brother who some family members said had become a radicalized Islamist in recent years. Timeline: A look at Tamerlan's past . The chairmen of the powerful House Intelligence and Homeland Affairs committees focused on Tamerlan's travels, insinuating links to terrorist training without making any definitive declarations or accusations. ""He, we believe, may have actually traveled on an alias to get back to his home country,"" Rep. Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who chairs the intelligence panel, told NBC. ""... So you know he had some radicalization before he left. You know that he didn't probably travel on his own name or some variation of his own name. And when he comes back, he has a renewed interest in that radicalization belief process."" Add it all up, Rogers said, and ""it would lead one to believe that's probably where he got that final radicalization to push him to commit acts of violence and where he may have received training on what we ultimately saw last Monday."" Rep. Michael McCaul, the Republican from Texas who chairs the homeland security committee, hinted to reporters that Tamerlan made additional trips to the northern Caucasus region than the 2012 visit made public by authorities. 'Enemy combatant' can be tried in civilian court . ""We know he's starting to radicalize in 2009, which would lead me to the, um, yeah, I could speculate that he was probably going over there more often,"" said McCaul, who is privy to congressional briefings on the matter. ""We don't have -- I don't have the evidence of that just yet. But that's obviously an area of focus."" Asked specifically about confirmation that Tamerlan made other trips, McCaul acknowledged that ""it's unconfirmed at this point,"" but added: ""My judgment is we'll probably see there were other trips to the region."" Such conjecture seeks in part to raise the specter of international terrorism at a time when Congress is wrestling with deficit reduction issues including forced spending cuts to the military and other government services. While concerns of an international terrorism link to the Boston bombers remains high, conservatives seek any opportunity to reinforce the need to maintain military readiness and national security in order to protect it as a spending priority amid the austerity debate in Washington. Republican Rep. Peter King of New York, who has complained that America let down its guard against terrorism, told ""Fox News Sunday"" he was referring specifically to Congress. ""Some of my own party want to start cutting funding for homeland security because they think this war is over,"" King said. ""It's not."" Meanwhile, Democratic legislators pushed back against GOP calls for designating 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev a war enemy to allow unfettered interrogation and possible indefinite detention, like terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay. Instead, they argued the suspect, who is hospitalized in serious but stable condition with wounds that included a gunshot to the throat, should be treated as a crime suspect with the right to legal representation. ""I don't think we have to cross the line and say he should be an enemy combatant, which could be challenged in court,"" Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York told CNN. Boston's week of terror . The issue dates to the ""war on terror"" from the Bush administration after the 9/11 attacks, and remains a sore point for liberals who question the constitutionality of designating a naturalized citizen such as the younger Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant. Schumer and follow Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California emphasized that a federal criminal charge against Tsarnaev could carry the death penalty in an effort to show their party wasn't soft on terrorism. ""The federal law allows the death penalty,"" Schumer said, noting that he wrote it in 1994. ""This is just the kind of case that it should be applied to. In fact, the only other time it's been used since '94 is on (Oklahoma City bomber) Timothy McVeigh and given the facts that I've seen, it would be appropriate to use the death penalty in this case and I would hope they would apply it in federal court."" Feinstein told reporters that Tsarnaev could be interrogated now for any information on possible further terrorism threats under a public safety exception to immediately informing a suspect of Miranda rights. ""If he's not Mirandized, it can't be used in a court of law,"" she said, noting authorities already had ""plenty of evidence"" that can be used to convict him. Suspects initially questioned under the public safety exemption and then later tried in civilian court include Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the ""underwear bomber"" who attempted to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009, and Faisal Shahzad for his 2010 attempt to detonate a bomb in Times Square. Conservative GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina made a similar argument to CNN in calling for Tsarnaev to be declared an enemy combatant for now, then later being criminally charged and put to trial in a civilian court. According to Graham, a public safety exception to reading Miranda rights will expire, meaning the ability to continue interrogating Tsarnaev could be jeopardized by his right to remain silent and be represented by an attorney. The public safety exception to the Miranda rule allows investigators to question suspects before apprising him of their rights when they believe there is an imminent public safety threat. Did one brother brainwash the other? Despite Graham's warning that the exception will expire, Attorney General Eric Holder has opened the door to longer interrogations for that purpose in cases involving ""operational"" terrorists. Another political dispute stemming from the Boston bombings involved calls by some conservative Republicans to put off consideration of bipartisan immigration reform legislation for now. GOP Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana said Sunday that Congress should wait until the emotional reaction to the bombings subsides before tackling the volatile issue of immigration. His comment to ABC followed a similar call last week by fellow Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who noted the Tsarnaev brothers were immigrants. ""It's important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,"" Grassley said, asking ""how can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil?"" Schumer, one of the ""Gang of Eight"" senators who drafted the immigration plan, said some on the right who opposed the bill were using the Boston bombing as an excuse to stall the legislation. ""If they have a reason, a suggestion as to how to change it based on what happened in Boston, we'll certainly be open to it,"" Schumer said. ""But we're not going to let them use what happened in Boston as an excuse, because our law toughens things up."" Graham, a Republican co-author, agreed it was time to tackle the immigration issue, saying ""we need to move on."" Immigration reform resonates with the Hispanic-American community, which is the nation's fastest-growing demographic and heavily supported President Barack Obama's re-election last year.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- It may be 23 years since Chinese soldiers gunned down unarmed protesters near Tiananmen Square but memories of that day remain raw for pro-democracy activists within and outside the country. More than 100,000 people are expected to gather in Hong Kong's Victoria Park Monday night for a candlelight vigil to remember the lives lost when tanks rolled into the Beijing square. The mainland government still bans public discussion of the events of June 4, 1989, when government forces intent on ending pro-democracy demonstrations opened fire on civilians. The official Chinese government account said 241, including soldiers, died and 7,000 were wounded. Rights campaigners say the number of dead was more likely to be in the thousands. In a written message to be read out at the Hong Kong vigil, Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng implored the Chinese government to ""follow the will of Heaven"" and advance democratic reforms. ""This Democracy Movement deserves universal approval,"" Chen said in the statement. ""We ask that its requests be treated appropriately. We do not desire revenge but we want to completely reveal the truth. We are in favor of tolerance, but against forgetfulness. People who are forgetful have no future,"" he said. Chen fled to the U.S. from China in May after escaping house arrest in his hometown of Dongshigu in Shandong province. He was kept a virtual prisoner in his home for 18 months, he said, following a four-year jail term for ""damaging property and organizing a mob to disturb traffic."" Chen discusses his next move . Chen is one of a number of activists who have been imprisoned or are currently detained for campaigning for human rights or religious freedom in Communist-led China. Bob Fu, founder of Christian human rights group ChinaAid, who helped Chen in his quest to relocate to the U.S., led a student protest on the day of the 1989 crackdown. ""It was a tragic massacre for simply the students exercising peaceful protest for demanding reform and anti-corruption and freedom in China,"" he told CNN. In China, there was no mention of the date in Monday's newspapers. And, government censors appeared to have been successful in deleting mention of the anniversary on Weibo, China's Twitter-like micro-blogging service. Some Weibo users were said to be trying to evade censorship by referring to June 4 as ""May 35th."" But, even those terms were quickly deleted on what is commonly referred to as the censors' busiest day of the year. The government is particularly sensitive this year, observers say, in the lead up to the once-in-a-decade leadership transition. In autumn, power will transfer to a new generation of politicians who will decide the future direction for China. Current President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao are both due to step down. In the days leading up to June 4, many known pro-democracy activists were said to have been detained as a pre-emptive measure to prevent dissent, according to Fu. ""Many of my friends and fellow freedom fighters have been under house arrest,"" Fu said. ""Especially in the last week or so, many were confined under soft detention without any freedom of movement."" Others have been held for far longer. Ahead of the anniversary, the U.S. State Department issued a statement urging the Chinese government to publicly acknowledge the day and end the persecution of those involved. ""We encourage the Chinese government to release all those still serving sentences for their participation in the demonstrations; to provide a full public accounting of those killed, detained or missing; and to end the continued harassment of demonstration participants and their families,"" the statement said. It added: ""We renew our call for China to protect the universal human rights of all its citizens; release those who have been wrongfully detained, prosecuted, incarcerated, forcibly disappeared, or placed under house arrest; and end the ongoing harassment of human rights activists and their families."" Amnesty International also issued a statement again calling for the government to hold an ""open and independent inquiry into the events of 1989."" The rights group paid tribute to Ya Weilin, the 73-year-old father of student who was shot and killed in the 1989 crackdown. Amnesty said Ya and his wife Zhang Zhenxia spent 20 years campaigning for the government to make amends for those killed in the 1989 demonstration. In a note written just before his death, Ya complained of the government's refusal to hear his grievances about his son's death and so he said he would ""fight with his death."" Ya was later found hanged in a garage below his home.","June 4 marks 23 years since Chinese soldiers opened fire on students .

"(CNN) -- He sports a ""Dux"" tattoo and has expressed a fascination with Benito Mussolini. Meet Paolo Di Canio -- the new Sunderland manager who is proving a polarizing figure after his appointment by the struggling English Premier League club. As his right-wing sympathies come under intense scrutiny, Di Canio says he only wants to talk about football -- though his controversial views threaten to overshadow his job of trying to keep Sunderland in the top flight. ""My life speaks for me so there is no need to speak any more about this situation because it is ridiculous and pathetic,"" Di Canio, who quit as manager of Swindon Town in England's third tier in February, told reporters. ""I can't every two weeks, every two months, every 10 months answer the same questions that are not really in my area."" But he might have to -- and in fact did a day later to try to stop more questions about his past. In 2005 while playing for Lazio, the club he supported as a boy, Di Canio told Italian news agency ANSA, ""I'm a fascist, not a racist,"" after making a straight-arm salute to Lazio fans in a game against city rival Roma. ""Dux,"" the Latin version of the nickname given to Mussolini, is branded on Di Canio's right arm and the Italian dictator is cited in his autobiography. Facebook criticism . Di Canio's appointment has already prompted British MP David Miliband to quit his post as Sunderland's vice-chairman and he isn't the only one dissatisfied with the Italian's hiring. A Facebook page, entitled ""Sunderland Against Fascist Di Canio"" has been set up and as of Wednesday morning UK time, had more than 4,000 ""likes."" A miners' association in the industrial north east of England region said it has written to Sunderland ""demanding"" the return of a banner at the club's Stadium of Light ""in protest of the decision to appoint the self-confessed fascist, Paolo Di Canio."" Sunderland's stadium was formerly the site of a coal mine. ""The appointment of Di Canio is a disgrace and a betrayal of all who fought and died in the fight against fascism,"" Dave Hopper, general secretary of the Durham Miners' Association, said on its website. The criticism didn't stop there. In a comment posted on website A Love Supreme, an independent Sunderland supporters' magazine, one reader wrote: ""If he supports fascism then he should be sacked immediately."" Such was the interest surrounding Di Canio's arrival at Sunderland, the site was overflowing with responses to the Italian's appointment. Is Di Canio racist? Given Italy's former fascist leader Mussolini enacted anti-Semitic laws and oversaw the deporting of thousands of Italian Jews to concentration and death camps, academic Kevin Passmore disagreed with the feeling of other Sunderland fans that Di Canio's political stance shouldn't have mattered when the club sought a new manager. However as for Di Canio's claim that he was a fascist ""but not a racist,"" Passmore acknowledged the 44-year-old may not be wrong. Di Canio -- still adored at West Ham, where he played for four years -- has attempted to quash suggestions he was a racist by claiming that two of his best friends during his playing career in England were black. ""Those who have called themselves fascists have had many different views, and they have often evolved over time,"" said Passmore, Reader in History at Cardiff University in Wales and the author of ""Fascism: a very short introduction"". ""Fascists did not agree what fascism was, and academics can't agree, either. So in principle, Di Canio could be right, and certainly Italian fascism was less racist than Nazism. However the story in practice could be different. ""These days, most people think that fascism does equal racism, rightly or wrongly, so one could argue that Di Canio is irresponsible,"" Passmore added. Another academic, Alberto Testa, agreed that differences existed in the definition of fascism, particularly in the United Kingdom and Italy. He pointed out that a fascist group in Italy had participated in charity work for minorities. In Italy, Testa said, Di Canio's comment of ""I am a fascist"" would mean ""many things."" ""I believe in Paolo Di Canio not being a racist,"" added Testa, who spent time ""embedded"" with Lazio and Roma ultras for the book ""Football, Fascism and Fandom: The UltraS of Italian Football,"" co-authored by Gary Armstrong. ""I also believe that a celebrity like him which has numerous fans in Italy and the UK should commit publicly to fight racism in football,"" said Testa, a lecturer at Brunel University in London. Fans back Italian . After Di Canio quit Swindon in February, the club's former chief executive provided a graphic description of his management style. ""Paolo would chuck a hand grenade and I would do the repair work at the end, like the Red Cross,"" said Nick Watkins. Janet Rowan, a season-ticket holder for nearly 20 years and secretary of a Sunderland supporters' association in Chester-le-Street, said Di Canio should not have been hired due to his lack of managerial experience. Though Swindon was promoted from the fourth division as champion under Di Canio in 2012, he lasted less than two seasons and resigned amid uncertainty involving the club's ownership. He claimed, too, that a player had been sold behind his back. ""It's down to his footballing experience rather than anything to do with politics,"" said Rowan. ""I think he's lacking in experience at the top level."" Simon Walsh, the 28-year-old editor of the Sunderland website Roker Report, said: ""He's trying to be made out as an uber-fascist when he's not."" In response to the question, ""Would you be happy if we appointed Paolo Di Canio?"" 61% of respondents on the Roker Report website said yes. If Sunderland wins or draw at Chelsea in Di Canio's first game in charge Sunday, much of the brouhaha surrounding him will dissipate, according to Walsh. Fred Taylor, from Sunderland's Boldon supporters' association, also said that the media was ""trying to make something out of nothing."" And Iain Dale, editor of website West Ham Till I Die and a radio broadcaster in London, wondered why Di Canio's past wasn't as intensely examined when he was in charge of Swindon. Di Canio's forward play for West Ham, including a stunning volley he struck against Wimbledon in 2000 that is widely regarded as one of the greatest goals in Premier League history, hasn't been forgotten by West Ham's supporters. ""If you want to be consistent, have a front page when he's played in this country and when he's come to Swindon, not just when he's appointed manager of a Premier League club,"" said Dale. When it comes to Di Canio, it seems, people will always agree to disagree.","Paolo Di Canio doesn't want to discuss his controversial political views .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to believe, but there was a time when Apple's computers were accused of being strictly last generation. Their computers were made with clunky Power PC processors, and Windows PC owners smirked at the wheezing Mac platform. Michael Dell even famously said the whole company was so behind the times that if it were up to him, he'd euthanize it. How things change. While the rest of the industry was counting Apple out, a Steve Jobs newly returned to Apple spent the early part of the last decade quietly assembling a time machine. Following the iPad, iPhone and MacBook Air before it, the retina-display MacBook Pro announced Monday at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco is just the latest time traveler Apple has sent back to us from the future. It's a machine so shiny, so shimmering, so futuristic, so unlike anything else out there that it will take the PC-making competition at least a year to release a truly competing product. How did this even happen? How did Apple assemble its time machine, and why can't the likes of Sony, HP, Dell, Acer and Lenovo seem to catch up? Apple announces high-res laptops . There's no flux capacitor involved, and although Apple's design team, led by Jony Ive, is truly visionary, there are lots of companies with revolutionary visions of the future of computing. The difference between Apple and other computer makers is that Apple can actually build the revolutionary, magical machines it dreams up. That's Apple's real mojo. They can actualize. Apple can say to themselves that they are going to revolutionize the professional laptop, or the smartphone, or the tablet, and then not only follow through with an enviable purity of design, source all of the parts and manufacture their product in utter secrecy, then ship the resulting en masse and sell them at unheard of profit margins. No one else can. It's all in Apple's mastery of the supply chain, which is Tim Cook's particular genius. His strategy is simple: When Apple decides to go ahead and make a revolutionary new product, it buys up literally almost all of the world's stock of the components that define the gadget. This not only gives Apple massive discounts in component prices, because they are buying in extreme bulk, but it also prevents the competition from quickly releasing clones of Apple's iconic machines, or matching Apple in price without cutting corners. It happens time and time again. When Apple first released the iPhone, it took the smartphone industry a year to release a phone that was even competitive, spec-for-spec, by which time Apple had already unveiled the iPhone 3GS. Hardware manufacturers trying to compete with Apple constantly discover that they can only build competing devices off of Apple's rejected parts, or else build new factories from the ground up to manufacture the parts they need. Look at the iPad. It has no competition, 2Â½ years in. Last quarter, Apple sold almost 12 million iPads. Comparatively, Apple's biggest competitor -- Samsung -- sold 1.1 million tablets. Why? Companies simply can't build products as good, or Apple's stranglehold on the manufacturing supply chain prevents them from doing so. Then there's a MacBook Air. We're starting to see competitive ultrabooks a year and a half after Apple unveiled the second-gen Air, but that's only after Intel reportedly set up a massive $500 million subsidy fund to help PC makers build a MacBook Air clone. The new retina-display MacBook Pro is another such product. It's a beast of a machine all around, but its defining feature is a high-resolution display with 220 pixels per inch, each smaller than the acuity of the human eye. It's far and away the best display of any notebook or even desktop on the market, and you can bet that Apple is in control of most of the world's supply of the panels necessary to make a machine that even comes close to competing. There's a famous Ray Bradbury story called ""A Sound of Thunder"" in which a man travels into the prehistoric past, accidentally squashes an insect underfoot and thus indelibly changes the future forever. Apple is that time traveler. The prehistoric insect is the competition. Apple crushes it underfoot with calculated purpose, and that is how the future of computing is once again forever changed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Brownlee.","John Brownlee: Unveiling of a new MacBook is another sign of Apple's competitive advantage .
He says Apple does more than innovate; it controls supply chain and freezes out competitors .
Apple's products can then be sold at extraordinarily high profit margins, he says .
Brownlee: Apple has a virtual ""time machine"" with which it's able to stay years ahead ."
"(CNN) -- With motor fluid spraying their faces and the weight of a car numbing their bodies, two Nevada college students struggled to stay calm after a drunk driver allegedly tore into their home, ripping them from their slumber. Kristin Palmer and Trent Wood were asleep in their home last week when a motorist allegedly drove into their bedroom around 4 a.m., mistakenly believing it was his ex-girlfriend's home. The University of Nevada students spent almost an hour pinned between the car and their bed while emergency workers battled furiously to free them. Somehow, the two left the scene with relatively minor scrapes and burns -- and a new lease on life, Wood said. ""When you experience something like that there's no limits anymore, you can try to do whatever you want to do,"" Wood told HLN's Mike Galanos. ""We feel like we have more of a purpose, like we were meant to live."" Authorities say the motorist was drunk when he drove into the couple's home in Sparks, mistakenly believing it was the home of his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend. Eric Cross is accused of drunken driving, battery with a deadly weapon, possession of a stolen vehicle, driving without a license and careless driving for his alleged role in the crash, which occurred October 21, according to the Washoe County Sheriff's Office. Initially, Woods struggled to comprehend what had happened to him after being abruptly torn from his slumber. ""I thought the roof caved in from an earthquake because it's an old house,"" Woods said. Then, his girlfriend began screaming and parts of the car came into focus, helping Woods to groggily piece the scene together, . ""I could see the tire to the right side and I was like, there's a car on top of me right now,"" he said. ""That was really hard to get through my head."" As fluid poured from the car, burning Palmer's face, the couple feared that the car might explode with them underneath, he said. Woods credited the slackness of the bed for preventing their legs from breaking altogether as the weight of the car pinned his girlfriend's entire body and his lower half to the bed. ""She was screaming really badly because I could actually move above my chest and neck, but she couldn't move anything,"" he said. The couple calmed down somewhat after emergency workers arrived at the scene, using chainsaws to rip through the wall, Wood said. About 42 minutes later, they had lifted the car enough to let the couple wiggle out from underneath it without it crushing their lower bodies. ""When the car was lifted and you could see blood circulating back through my legs, that was probably the happiest moment of my life: Yes! I'm not paralyzed,"" he said. ""I was so happy, hugging everyone and making sure Kristin was all right,"" he said. ""I was just real happy to get out of there."" The couple is accepting donations through the Bank of America to replace items lost in the incident. HLN's Amanda Sloane contributed to this report.","University of Nevada students asleep when motorist drove into home around 4 a.m.

"(CNN) -- For a while, it happened only every few years or so. Now, there rarely is a month, week or day that passes without a big-time program in college football sprinting deep into scandal while daring the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to tackle it. The University of Miami is just the latest team on the verge of drawing penalty flags from NCAA officials for unnecessary silliness. In fact, the Hurricanes could draw the ultimate penalty in college football, called the death penalty. The NCAA only considers giving such a penalty to a university facing a second major violation within five years or dealing with a particularly outrageous situation. SI: Why NCAA wouldn't give Miami the death penalty . That was the case for Southern Methodist University, whose football program was banned for two seasons during the 1980s. No other program ever has received the death penalty, but there is rampant speculation that Miami could be the second. The Hurricanes reportedly had dozens of past and former players spend a stretch from 2002 to 2010 receiving illegal gifts and other things from Nevin Shapiro, a convicted Ponzi schemer and Miami booster. Yahoo Sports broke the story after 100 hours of jailhouse interviews with Shapiro, who pleaded guilty to robbing investors of around $83 million in his Ponzi scheme of $930 million. Yahoo Sports also reported that several Miami coaches and administrators tried to cover up the matter. Among other revelations, Shapiro told the website that he spent ""millions"" on Miami players, ranging from sex parties on his yacht to expensive jewelry to an abortion for a woman impregnated by a Hurricane player. The Miami situation is so egregious that NCAA president Mark Emmert issued the following statement: ""If the assertions are true, the conduct at the University of Miami is an illustration of the need for serious and fundamental change in many critical aspects of college sports."" If this sounds familiar, it should. Along the Hurricanes' way to five national championships from 1983 through 2001, they flaunted their bad-boy image while ducking in and out of the NCAA slammer for rules violations. The Miami program crumbled after that. SI: The NCAA system is broken; here's how to fix it . Then, to hear these reports tell it, the Hurricanes tried to revive their glory days through shortcuts. They aren't alone with those shortcuts. Ohio State. Southern Cal. Auburn. North Carolina. Oregon. Tennessee. LSU. Those are just some of the other big-time college football programs in the news for stuff other than blocking and tackling. They've been mentioned more regarding cheating and scheming. Just take it from Kirk Herbstreit, the award-winning college football analyst for ESPN, who told CNN.com, ""I honestly don't think the sport has ever had as tumultuous of an off-season as we had during this year. I do mean, EVER, and I'm referring to the entire history of the sport."" Through it all, with NCAA enforcement people looking more powerless than Barney Fife from those old Andy Griffith sitcoms, there have been sordid tales involving automobiles, houses and even prostitutes. There have been recruiting violations -- gigantic ones -- of all shapes, sizes and situations. There have been cover-ups and alleged cover-ups, ranging from coaching staffs to the highest levels of universities. Mostly, there has been no reason to believe things will improve in big-time college football before the end of the millennium. ""I just think the leadership groups -- including coaches, people who care about the sport at the end of the day -- have got to come up with some ideas and brainstorming ways on how to police this,"" said Herbstreit, a former quarterback at Ohio State, where its last quarterback, Terrelle Pryor, was among those who helped place the school under its current NCAA investigation for a slew of things. Jim Tressel was forced to resign as head coach despite leading Ohio State to six Big Ten titles, a national championship and eight victories out nine games against despised rival Michigan. The thing is, even though Ohio State volunteered to ""vacate"" its 12 victories last season while submitting to a two-year probation -- in addition to whatever else the NCAA may impose this fall -- the Buckeyes remain a powerhouse in the Big Ten. They also continue to rank among the top recruiters in college football. They have little to no incentive not to thumb their noses again at the NCAA cops. Added Herbstreit, ""That's why we have to figure out how to try to get college football back to people in charge who generally care about the health of the game and not just about churning kids out to get them ready for the NFL. That's not what college football is all about."" As for reality, when it comes to the big boys, college football really is about teams acquiring as many NFL-caliber players as possible to help them with the bottom line -- winning. Winning big by any means necessary. Which raises a question: For the sake of that bottom line, are more than a few college football programs (and their conferences, for that matter) deciding to suffer the consequences of cheating on purpose these days? After all, winning means money, and the money associated with teams and conferences winning consistently in the NCAA's so-called Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as Division 1-A) is huge. The SEC is in the midst of a $2.2 billion contract with ESPN. During the last two seasons of the Big Ten Network, each conference school received slightly more than $6 million. The University of Texas is joining Notre Dame with its own television network, and the payouts for both contracts could slice chunks from the national debt. If you combine those TV examples with the NCAA setting another record for football attendance last year, the money/incentive for the big boys to continue as bad boys regarding NCAA rules is outrageous. According to the SportsBusiness Journal, the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) distributed more than $174 million earlier this year to teams that played in its five bowls. The Journal also said the payout was a 22 percent increase over last year's total, and consider this: The conferences receiving the most money -- $27.2 million each, for having two teams apiece in BCS games -- were the Big Ten, Pac-10 and Southeastern Conference (SEC). SI: This is more than a Miami problem . Some of the biggest scandals of the last few months have involved teams from those conferences. There is Auburn, for instance, and the Tigers are the latest in a string of five consecutive teams from the SEC to win the national championship. They did so with Heisman-winning quarterback Cam Newton spending his one year at Auburn battling opponents and reports that his father sought as much as $180,000 from schools for rights to his son. The NCAA allowed Newton to continue to play, but they say the investigation isn't closed. So did Auburn know about Newton's issues, ignore them and use his considerable talents for the sake of now instead of the future? Only Auburn officials know, but this is for sure: Members of the Tiger Nation always can say their folks whipped Oregon on the field last season for its first national championship since 1957. You know, that bottom line.","The University of Miami is being investigated over claims made by an ex-booster .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama used a Memorial Day ceremony to say it is time for America to properly welcome home Vietnam veterans and show them and their families the respect and gratitude they deserved but didn't receive decades ago. ""You came home and sometimes were denigrated when you should have been celebrated,"" Obama said beneath a scorching sun at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. ""It was a national shame, a disgrace that should have never happened. That's why here today, we resolve that it will not happen again."" The event, which launched a 13-year Vietnam War 50th anniversary commemoration, was the culmination of a day of somber events on the annual holiday honoring America's war dead. By the numbers: Veterans and Memorial Day . Earlier, Obama laid a wreath to fallen U.S. warriors at Arlington National Cemetery, then pledged the full support of a grateful nation to returning veterans and their families. ""For the first time in nine years, Americans are not fighting and dying in Iraq,"" the president said to applause. ""We are winding down the war in Afghanistan and our troops will continue to come home. After a decade under the dark cloud of war, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon."" Now the task is to remember those who died and ""meet our obligations to those who did come home,"" Obama said, adding, ""America will be there for you."" At the National World War II Memorial, retired Army Lt. Gen. Mick Kicklighter paid tribute to the fallen from that conflict. ""At this site, we remember the 400,000 men and women who lost their lives defending our freedom during World War II some 70 years ago,"" he said. ""Memorial Day remains a time of solemn observance as we remember and honor all of those who gave all their tomorrows. That's a very high price to pay when you're 18 and 19 years old. But they gave all their futures so that you and I could live in this strong, free and beautiful America. Freedom is not free."" This year marks the 50th anniversary of the United States deploying a significant military presence in Vietnam. In 1962, about 10,000 U.S. military advisers joined the 900 already in the country. A proclamation signed Friday by Obama said the Vietnam 50th anniversary commemoration will continue until November 11, 2025, ""to honor and give thanks to a generation of proud Americans who saw our country through one of the most challenging missions we have ever faced."" ""While no words will ever be fully worthy of their service, nor any honor truly befitting their sacrifice, let us remember that it is never too late to pay tribute to the men and women who answered the call of duty with courage and valor,"" the proclamation states. The first phase of the commemoration over the next two years involves generating support and participation, with a focus on ""hometown"" events providing personal recognition and thanks to Vietnam veterans, according to information provided to the media. 'The thing about remembering is that you don't forget' In his remarks at the ceremony, Obama spoke of making amends for the nation's failure to properly welcome home Vietnam veterans in the 1960s and '70s. ""A central part of this 50th anniversary is to tell your story as it should have been told all along,"" the president said, calling it ""another chance to set the record straight."" Later, he called it ""another opportunity to say to our Vietnam veterans what we should have been saying from the beginning: You did your job, you served with honor, you made us proud."" ""You have earned your place among the greatest generations,"" said Obama, who twice pulled out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat off his brow. In an emotional moment, he asked Vietnam veterans in the crowd to stand and spoke words he characterized as long overdue: ""Welcome home. Welcome home. Welcome home. Thank you. We appreciate you. Welcome home."" The lesson of Vietnam, Obama said, was to separate the war from the warrior, so that patriotism never again becomes what he called a ""political sword"" that divides the nation. ""Patriots can support a war, patriots can oppose a war and whatever our view, let us always stand united in support of our troops who we've placed in harm's way,"" he said. Decades later, Obama said, the true legacy from the ""hard lessons"" of Vietnam is that America is stronger and takes care of its returning veterans and their families. Obama and other speakers at the ceremony hosted by actor Tom Selleck, spoke of issues close to Vietnam veterans, including the continued effort to identify and repatriate remains of the more than 1,000 missing in action. Facing a tough re-election campaign this year, Obama avoided direct political references but made sure to emphasize his administration's efforts to help returning war veterans. Military spending will be a major political battleground in coming months, with both Democrats and Republicans agreeing on the need to reduce budget deficits but in sharp disagreement over how to do it. If they can't reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year, sharp spending cuts are scheduled to take effect that would include military funding. In San Diego, the certain Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, held a Memorial Day event to call for prioritizing military spending. Saying ""the world is not safe,"" Romney said the choice is between shrinking the military to pay for social needs or to ""commit to preserve America as the strongest military in the world."" ""We choose that course in America not so that we win wars but so we can prevent wars, because a strong America is the best deterrent to war there ever has been invented,"" Romney said.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama will find that much has changed in Mexico when he arrives on May 2. Our neighbor to the South -- and second-largest export market -- has moved far ahead with reforms. As Congress crafts comprehensive immigration legislation, Democrats and Republicans must keep in mind that Mexico is changing rapidly, and policies crafted to reflect yesterday's Mexico will not help the U.S. make the most of the potential of today's and tomorrow's Mexico. Mexico's future is bright, and tapping into this growth and economic prosperity is vital to U.S. competitiveness. But the U.S. needs immigration reform to build on its huge bilateral trade with Mexico -- more than $1 billion in goods and services each day, or $45 million an hour. Mexico's President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto has achieved in less than five months in office what eluded previous administrations for six years. In the second half of 2013, he hopes to add energy to the improvements in education and telecommunications that are sailing through under the umbrella of the Pact for Mexico political agreement. Demographic and economic transformations in Mexico mean that the U.S. can expect the number of Mexicans coming into the U.S. to slow to a trickle. Mexicans make up about 58% of the 11 million in the U.S. without authorization. The Pew Hispanic Center reports zero net migration from 2005 to 2010, with about 1.4 million Mexicans both entering and leaving the United States. Pew demographers even raise the possibility that the return flow may be exceeding the number of Mexicans coming north. The reasons for the drop in Mexican migration are a combination of changes in the ""push"" and ""pull"" factors that determine migratory patterns. The decline in the ""pull"" factor is all too well-known -- it's no longer so desirable to migrate to the U.S. for jobs. But Mexico's rise also means that going north is a less attractive option for getting ahead in life. Its economy grew at more than double the rate of the U.S. last year, with a projected 3.5% growth in 2013. Between 2005 and 2008, as noted in Americas Society and Council of the Americas ""Get the Facts"" series, the number of new Mexican businesses created each year increased by 27%, which is 2.5 times the G20 average. Over the same period, the number of students in Mexico graduating from advanced university level programs increased by 11%. If the February education reform, aimed at improving standards to boost the overall quality of education, is successful, more young Mexicans will have the training to compete in the 21st century workforce. In the past decade, the Mexican middle class grew by 17%, and in just two generations, the fertility rate dropped nearly 70% -- signaling the end of the youth bulge that contributed to the ""push"" to the United States. Mexico is a hub of business activity. Despite the insecurity in certain parts of the country, Mexican entrepreneurs and foreign companies are setting up shop. Guadalajara is fast-becoming Mexico's Silicon Valley with tech entrepreneurs from across Mexico flocking to the capital of Jalisco state. At the same time, as wages rise in China, firms are relocating their manufacturing options to Mexico, where wages remain competitive and where products have easier access to the U.S. and Canadian markets through the North American Free Trade Agreement. Comprehensive immigration reform will open a gateway to one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies. By providing a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants of Mexican origin, reform will make it easier for laborers to cross borders, which will harness the competitiveness of both countries. It would also show that the U.S. is a true economic partner with Mexico and the rest of the Americas. Legal status would open the door for these immigrants and their children to further increase their contributions to the U.S. economy and to start small businesses that would capitalize on their cross-border networks. This is a highly likely scenario as immigrants are more likely to start a business than those born in the U.S., and Mexicans represent the greatest number of foreign-born small-business owners. At the same time, greater emphasis on a demand-driven visa system would create new ways for workers to enter the U.S. who will be increasingly needed as baby boomers retire. Also critical for increasing cross-border trade is improving efficiency at the border. Any new border security plan should improve infrastructure and technology to reduce the congestion that delays trade. Improved trade means more U.S. jobs, with 6 million, or 1 in 24 jobs, across 22 states attributed to bilateral commerce. Undocumented immigration will keep declining as more Mexicans find new opportunities at home. That means the big question for Congress to consider should be how to ensure that our immigration system helps North American competitiveness and prosperity, and how the U.S. can attract the workers -- including Mexicans-- it will need.","Jason Marczak: Obama will see a Mexico on the rise economically when he visits .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A judge revoked Lindsay Lohan's probation Monday and the actress was ordered to appear in court Friday, a Los Angeles court spokesman said. Lohan acknowledged through Twitter postings Friday night that she failed a recent drug test and that she was ""prepared to appear before judge Fox next week as a result."" Judge Elden Fox signed a bench warrant for Lohan's arrest but is holding it until a hearing at 8:30 a.m. Friday, according to Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman Allan Parachini. Lohan's supervised probation for a 2007 drunken driving conviction requires frequent drug tests. The judge warned her last month any failure could send her back to jail. ""Regrettably, I did in fact fail my most recent drug test and if I am asked, I am prepared to appear before judge Fox next week as a result,"" Lohan tweeted Friday evening. She spent 23 days in a court-ordered drug rehab program last month, which followed a 13-day jail stint imposed when a Los Angeles judge ruled that Lohan violated her probation. Fox, who took over Lohan's case when she was released, imposed a new set of rules for her to follow until November. It included weekly counseling sessions for alcohol and drug rehabilitation, random drug tests and behavioral therapy. ""Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away overnight,"" Lohan tweeted. ""I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps."" Lohan tweeted that she was ""doing what I must do to prevent any mishaps in the future."" ""This was certainly a setback for me, but I am taking responsibility for my actions and I'm prepared to face the consequences,"" she tweeted. Lohan made fun of her substance abuse troubles in a backstage skit broadcast during last Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards. She appeared with show host Chelsea Handler, who was wearing an alcohol-detection bracelet like the one Lohan recently wore. ""Wake up, Handler, pull it together,"" Lohan said as she slammed Handler against a wall. ""You're a menace. Do you think anyone will work with a drunk? Take it from me, they don't."" Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident she was charged with cocaine possession. The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later, when she played identical twins in Disney's remake of ""The Parent Trap.""

"(CNN) -- With Pope Benedict XVI leaving the papal office after resigning two weeks ago, the Roman Catholic Church will have to rush to pick his replacement before Easter. Normally, the College of Cardinals is not allowed to select a new pontiff until 15 to 20 days after the office becomes vacant -- usually when the previous pope has died. Benedict's resignation is a rare exception. The last man to quit the head of the Catholic Church did so 600 years ago. The situation calls for some rule bending, and having the current pope involved is proving advantageous. Interactive: Where does the pope live? He has slightly amended the 500-year-old policy on pope selection to get a successor into place more rapidly. The cardinals may to be able to pull it off before March 15, according to Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman. This would give the new pontiff a little over a week to prepare for the next mass, Palm Sunday celebrations, on March 24. While Benedict won't be directly involved in his successor's selection, his influence will undoubtedly be felt. He appointed 67 of at least 115 cardinals set to make the decision. The pope gives his last audience Wednesday morning. His last day on the job is Thursday. Here's a look at the process of electing a new pope: . A look at possible papal contenders . What has to happen first? There were traditionally three methods of choosing a new pope, but the church abolished two, leaving cardinals to pick a peer via paper ballot only. When a pope dies, the dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals calls for a meeting of all cardinals eligible to vote -- those under age 80. They have to vote in person. Although some work at the Vatican, most are spread out worldwide, running dioceses or archdioceses, and will have to travel to Rome. Once they get there, they can't leave until the process is done and aren't allowed to talk with anyone outside of the conclave. Though Benedict left the rules greatly untouched, experts on the church's constitution will comb through the section on the ""Vacancy of the Apostolic See and the Election of the Roman Pontiff"" (how to elect a new pope when the office is vacant) and interpret proper protocol for the election. Benedict's predecessor, the widely popular John Paul II, made a number of changes to the voting process in 1996 to make it less taxing on the cardinals. Opinion: How next pope must tackle child sex abuse . Will the world get to see the process? Although the procedure is transparent to participating cardinals, no one else is supposed to find out about the vote. In his amendments to voting procedures in 1996, John Paul II anticipated modern forms of communication and forbade any recording devices. He ordered that technicians check the Sistine Chapel for hidden microphones or cameras before the balloting begins. The new pope would be called to deal with violators personally. ""They will be subject to grave penalties according to the judgment of the future pope,"" the former pontiff wrote. Notes cardinals make during the voting must be burned with the ballots. The final declaration of a winner is sealed in an envelope and archived. It may be opened only by order of the pope. The pope in retirement: What to expect . What does balloting look like? The meeting of cardinals, called the conclave, usually begins with a special morning mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a procession to the Sistine Chapel -- known for its famous ceiling painting by Renaissance artist Michelangelo -- to begin the voting process. Ballots are passed out, and cardinals write in a candidate's name and fold it up, then one by one, in order of seniority, they approach an altar and ceremoniously place their ballots into a chalice. Voting is secret, but ballots are counted in the open. A cardinal needs a vote of two-thirds to ascend to the papacy. If there is no winner, the vote is repeated one time on the first day. Surprising standards for next Catholic leader . What does the smoke from the chimney mean? After some of the rounds of voting, the ballots land in a furnace. If no one has won, a chemical is added to make the smoke black. This lets people waiting in St. Peter's Square below know that there is no new pope yet. If there is a winner, no chemical is added, and the smoke remains white, telling the world that the conclave has agreed on a new pontiff. In the past, it has been hard for the crowd waiting in St. Peter's Square below to discern the color, which has sometimes billowed out in shades of gray. The Vatican has attempted to remedy this by adding a second furnace to boost the intended color. Scandal threatens to overshadow pope's final days . What if there is no winner? Then they vote again, and again, and again. The cardinals may cast ballots as many as four times on the second and third days, according to voting rules laid down by John Paul II. By the end of the third day, if there is still no new pope, they break for a day for prayer, discussions and admonitions from a senior cardinal. This recovery day was instituted by John Paul II. Voting can go on for another seven rounds of balloting. Still no pope?  Keep voting. John Paul had decided to save the cardinals from themselves, if they reach this point. He reduced the necessary result to elect a new pope to an absolute majority -- 50% plus one vote -- if they cross this tiring threshold. But in 2007, Benedict reversed the rule, so once again, two-thirds are needed to elect, according to CNN's Vatican expert, John Allen. The pope emeritus preserved the day of rest on every third day of a deadlock. A long deadlock would be unusual, according to the Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island. Of the past 11 conclaves, none has run longer than four days. When there's finally a winner, what next? The winner must accept the decision for it to be valid. Once he does, the dean asks him to choose a papal name. The oldest cardinal announces the new pope to the crowd in the square from a balcony. The new pope joins him to bless the crowd and the rest of the world. Past popes have been crowned during a coronation ceremony, but John Paul II refused it, and Benedict followed suit. Both were inaugurated in a mass in St. Peter's Cathedral. Could the next pope be from Africa or Latin America? CNN's Kyle Almond contributed to this report.","Benedict changed a rule, which means the selection could take longer .

"(CNN) -- Police have charged the bassist of the rock band 3 Doors Down with vehicular homicide after they said his speeding car clipped a pickup truck, sending it down an embankment and killing the driver. The incident took place Friday night in Nashville. Police said Robert Todd Harrell, 41, showed signs of impairment and acknowledged he had consumed hard cider and taken the prescription pills Lortab and Xanax. During a search in the booking room, authorities said, Davidson County Sheriff's deputies discovered a plastic bag concealed in his sock that contained 8 Xanax pills, 24 oxycodone pills and 4 oxymorphone pills. Harrell also has been charged with bringing controlled substances into the jail. He was being held in lieu of $100,000 bond. Police said the pickup's driver, Paul Howard Shoulders, was not wearing a seat belt and was ejected from his truck. He was pronounced dead at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""We are deeply saddened by the passing of Paul Howard Shoulders, Jr.,"" said a statement on the band's website. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to his family and friends at this difficult time."" 3 Doors Down may be best known for its song ""Kryptonite,"" but had a string of hits in the early 2000s, including ""When I'm Gone"" and ""Here Without You."" Harrell is one of three founding members of the group that formed in Escatawpa, Mississippi, in 1994, according to allmusic.com.

"(CNN) -- If you can believe it, it's been 25 years since Edward James Olmos portrayed real-life math teacher Jaime Escalante in ""Stand and Deliver."" Escalante, a Bolivian immigrant, taught in a tough East L.A. high school and pushed his lowest-achieving students to learn calculus. The inspirational role won Olmos a Golden Globe and garnered him an Academy Award nomination for best actor, a first for an American-born Latino. Since then, he's played memorable roles, such as Lt. Martin Castillo in ""Miami Vice,"" Abraham Quintanilla in the film ""Selena"" and William Adama in ""Battlestar Galactica."" Now, in his newest role as executive producer and actor in ""Filly Brown,"" he plays lawyer named Leandro who tries to help Mexican-American hip-hop artist Maria Jose 'Majo' Tonorio, aka Filly Brown, and her family get her mom out of jail. The late Jenni Rivera plays the part of Majo's mother MarÃ­a and Lou Diamond Philips plays the father who takes care of Majo and her younger sister. Olmos took some time to talk to CNN about the genuine portrayal of Jaime Escalante, what Latinos can do to make it in Hollywood and why Filly Brown's story needs to be told. It's been 25 years since ""Stand and Deliver"" premiered in theaters. Did you ever imagine that the movie would be so successful and influential as it's been? I don't think anyone could've predicted that. Teachers use (it) as part of their curriculum. Millions of kids see it every year. That's why the movie is so well seen. It's amazing what that movie has done with the youth. I don't think anyone could have guessed that it would be used the way it's being used. It continues to be inspirational. You're very well-known for choosing your roles carefully. How genuine was your portrayal of Jaime Escalante? Everything I did was him. I just copied him as much as I possibly could. All his mannerisms, the way he moved, the way he walked, the way he touched his hair. I saw him do all these things and then just did it all. He worked with me to get the character just right and his memory was always right on. We wrote the script together from day one. What advice do you have for other Latinos trying to make it in Hollywood? Just don't give up. The only people I know who don't make it are the ones that quit. They must be continually educating themselves in the art form. Every day, seven days a week for eight consecutive years, I was on stage: singing, talking, acting and performing. It's like playing a piano. Have you heard of a musician that's really successful not playing their instrument everyday? Never, never. They play religiously. If I can brush my teeth everyday, I can do something I love everyday, even when I don't feel like doing it. That's really the key to success in this industry and in anything you do. Do the things you love to do when you don't feel like doing them. Hollywood has been known to hesitate to use Latino people to tell these Latino stories. Why do you think that is? I don't think that they feel like there is a need a for it. The industry doesn't have anything against Latinos. If they are feeding them American food like hamburgers, and they're eating it by the billions, why do they have to feed them Mexican food? They don't because they like it. Why should Hollywood back actors who cannot bring in the money? That's going to take time. Can you tell me a bit about your role in ""Filly Brown?"" I play an attorney who tries to help Filly Brown get her mother out of prison. I've never played an attorney before. And, I'm also the executive producer for the film. The film is a co-directed by Yussef Delara and Michael D' Olmos. How was it working with your son? It was great. It's always fun to work with your family. I'm very grateful for it. My other son, Mico Olmos, helped produce it. It's been a family affair. Why do you think it's so important to tell the story of ""Filly Brown?"" It's a story that's never been told before in the history of film. That's a good reason to do anything. There's never been a movie of a Latina hip-hop artist who raps her poetry as well as her songs. What was it like to work with Jenni Rivera, as this was the first time she took on an acting role? That was probably the most inspirational part of the filming process. She ended up becoming the most inspirational artist on the set. Gina Rodriguez (who plays Majo) and her were just amazing. They just really committed, and their technique was so strong. Their ability to create the reality was just profound. Those that have seen it are left stunned. You will see if you haven't already, it's the best final scene in a movie that I've seen in years. What do you want the audience, Latinos as well as non-Latinos, to take away with them after watching their film? You can't go through this life alone. You don't reach the clarity that you do in life unless you work with your family. And, if the Academy has an opportunity to see this film, they will get to see truly riveting performances in a very modest film. ""Filly Brown"" opens in theaters on Friday, April 19th.","25 years since Edward James Olmos portrayed real-life math teacher in ""Stand and Deliver""

"(CNN) -- A Disney Cruise Line employee has been reported missing during a seven-day cruise off the Mexico's Pacific coast, the company said Thursday. The unidentified worker on board the Disney Wonder failed to appear for a Tuesday shift, Disney spokeswoman Christi Erwin Donnan said. The vessel, which left Los Angeles on Sunday, docked Wednesday in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Donnan said. The U.S. Coast Guard, the Mexican navy and the Bahamas Maritime Authority have participated in the search and investigation, Donnan said. The Disney Wonder is registered in the Bahamas. The Mexican navy has been conducting searches since Tuesday, Disney Cruise Line said in a written statement. ""Given the circumstances, we are very concerned about this situation and are doing everything possible to assist with the search effort and investigation,"" it said. The company said it conducted a thorough inspection of the cruise ship. U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Pamela Manns said the Mexican navy is leading the search and asked for Coast Guard help early in the effort. The Coast Guard provided long-range search aircraft but is not now actively involved in the search. The FBI is not involved because it does not have jurisdiction, as the ship was off the coast of Mexico flying under a foreign flag, said spokeswoman Laura Eimiller of the agency's Los Angeles office. But the FBI has heard no reports of criminal activity or foul play, she said. CNN's Dave Alsup and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","A cruise line employee has not been seen since Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Celebrity mugshots are hilarious, aren't they? The disheveled hair, the smeared makeup, the ridiculous attempt by some to still try to look ""hot"" despite the circumstances. The most iconic post-arrest shot is Nick Nolte circa 2002. He looks as if he went through a carwash riding on the hood. The mugshot even has its own Twitter handle. Yeah, it's all fun and games until you read why these celebrities were arrested in the first place. Nolte was brought in for suspicion of driving under the influence. Wynonna Judd was arrested in 2003, accused of the same thing. As was Nicole Richie in 2006 and Kiefer Sutherland in 2007. Knicks point guard Jason Kidd is lucky to be alive. He was arrested in 2012 after running into a utility pole. Todd Harrell, the bassist for the band 3 Doors Down, is also fortunate to be alive. In April, he was charged with vehicular homicide when the car he was driving clipped a pickup and crashed into a retaining wall. Unfortunately, the truck he hit swerved out of control, hit a guardrail, dropped down an embankment and overturned, killing the driver. When that happens, the mugshots of celebrity drunken drivers become less funny. This week, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended all 50 states decrease the blood alcohol content threshold for drunken driving from 0.08% to 0.05%. The goal is to have zero deaths from alcohol-related car accidents. Noble but unattainable if our attitude about drinking and driving doesn't change. In 2010, adults self-reported drinking and driving about 112 million times. Only 1.4 million drivers -- about 1% -- were arrested. In other words, if someone has had one too many drinks and gets behind the wheel of a car 100 times in a year, they might get caught once. How do you convince a nation that gets away with a crime 99% of the time that it's a serious matter? We can talk about the deaths, but let's be honest -- more than 10,000 people dying each year because of alcohol-impaired crashes is sad. But more teens die from texting and driving than drinking and driving. So, shouldn't we put more energy into that instead? To really move the needle on any issue of importance, it helps to make it a personal matter as it is a legal one. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 85% of self-reported drunken drivers were binge drinkers. For men, that constitutes at least five drinks in an hour. Five drinks raises your level to .10%. So instead of using resources to lobby for a new federal law that lowers the threshold, the NTSB should direct its influence on helping states enforce the current one. If more people were caught, the less other people would feel that they could get away with it. Lowering the blood alcohol threshold does nothing if we don't increase the number of checkpoints so people can be arrested for breaking the current law. And you could fund this increase in checkpoints by doing something the World Health Organization recommends: imposing a tax on alcoholic beverages. For a 180-pound man, as little as two beers could cause his blood alcohol content to reach 0.05. How many elected officials are really going to want to fight food and beverage lobbyists in addition to bar and restaurant owners for that? A slight increase in price to fund an initiative to arrest drunken drivers will not only discourage binge drinking (because it's more expensive to do so), but it is a message that's easier to sell to a nation that consumed 6.3 billion gallons of beer in 2011. Maybe then instead of dismissing the Noltes and Lindsay Lohans of the world as being stupid enough to get caught, the public would view celebrities who are arrested for drunken driving as reminders that they could be caught, too. Because at the end of the day, the NTSB can try to pass all the laws it wants, but if people don't get caught, then the law is toothless. That's part of the reason why celebrity mugshots are so funny because those fools got caught. But drunken driving would be less funny to everyone if more people were greeted at a checkpoint with a Breathalyzer. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","National Transportation Safety Board wants to reduce blood alcohol benchmark .

"(CNN) -- The nightmare began around 12:30 p.m. on Christmas Eve. Mike Hermanstorfer stood next to his wife's hospital bed, stricken. He touched her arm. The skin was cold, ashen. Tracy Hermanstorfer's heart had stopped. ""I opened my hand and her arm just fell out of mine,"" said Hermanstorfer. ""She was already gone."" Moments later, the staff at Memorial Health System in Colorado Springs, Colorado, sounded a Code Blue -- resuscitation needed for cardiac arrest. They would have to act fast: Tracy Hermanstorfer, 33, was also in labor. Her baby was perilously close to death. But this was a perplexing case. Before her heart stopped beating, Tracy Hermanstorfer was, by all accounts, completely healthy. Doctors still have few clues about what caused her cardiac arrest. ""The risk of a woman dying in the course of trying to carry a pregnancy is an incredibly rare event,"" said Dr. Michael Greene, director of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, who was not involved with Hermanstorfer's case. ""The number of things that can cause this in an otherwise healthy woman is a very short list."" Greene says that only around eight in 100,000 women die during childbirth in the United States. Dr. Stephanie Martin was 100 yards away when the Code Blue sounded. She ran to the delivery room where Mike Hermanstorfer stood next to what he thought was his dead wife. ""My first thought was that I can't allow this father to lose both his wife and his child, especially on Christmas Eve,"" said Martin, director of maternal-fetal medicine at Memorial Health System. Watch the Hermanstorfers on AC 360 . It was a situation she had witnessed only nine or 10 times during her career. Based on experience, Martin had ideas about what might have caused Hermanstorfer's cardiac arrest, but nothing was certain. She could rule out things like pre-existing heart problems -- they are rare for someone healthy, young, and with no family history. Hermanstorfer had not experienced excessive blood loss or other major trauma, also common reasons for cardiac problems during childbirth. Watch Dr. Gupta explain what may have happenend . Hermanstorfer could have an amniotic fluid embolism, a condition in which the fluid suspending the baby in utero leaks into the mother's bloodstream. It could also be pulmonary embolism, in which a blood clot in the leg breaks off and lodges in lung tissue. Both conditions cause blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels in the blood to plummet -- precisely what was happening to Tracy Hermanstorfer. At 12:40 p.m., staff attempted to resuscitate Hermanstorfer using a rapid-fire sequence of chest compressions. She was unresponsive. Four minutes later, fearing for the baby's life, they performed an emergency Caesarean section. ""We call it a four-minute rule,"" said Martin. ""I knew that if Tracy was not resuscitated by four to five minutes after her heart stopped, [the baby's] chances for brain injury began to increase dramatically."" But Martin says that if a baby is removed from its mother within five minutes of a witnessed cardiac arrest, the baby will survive 95 percent of the time. At 12:46 p.m., Mike and Tracy's baby boy, Coltyn, was born via C-section, limp, but with a faint pulse. Moments after her son was born, Tracy took a timid sip of breath for the first time in several minutes. Her pulse was barely perceptible, but it was there. Almost as suddenly as she had ""died,"" she was alive again. ""We all stopped and took a breath,"" said Martin. ""We had to make sure she wasn't going to re-arrest."" Tracy was stable. Doctors quickly wheeled her out to an operating room to finish her Caesarean and put her on a ventilator to help her breathe. Hospital staff continued their resuscitation of baby Coltyn. In a few minutes his skin was flushed; he gasped for air and let out a loud wail. ""I thought he was dead until he gasped for air,"" said Mike Hermanstorfer. ""When he let that cry out, that's when the whole world stops. Most parents can't stand the sound of a crying baby, but I'll tell you from experience that's one of the best sounds you could ever hear.""

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Court documents obtained by CNN on Friday reveal disturbing new details about the prior conviction of the alleged ringleader of a group charged this week with imprisoning four mentally disabled adults in a dank Philadelphia boiler room. Linda Ann Weston, 51, served eight years in prison for killing her sister's boyfriend, Bernardo Ramos, in the early 1980s, according to Philadelphia police. The newly obtained documents show Ramos, held captive in a closet, weighed 75 pounds at the time of his death by starvation in December 1981. The medical examiner at the time determined the cause of death ""due to the clear visibility of his protruding ribs, sunken cheeks and emaciated body,"" according to the documents. Weston, along with three others, is currently facing charges including criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment after the landlord of an apartment building discovered Saturday four malnourished people locked in a 15-by-6-foot room with no food and only a bucket for a toilet, according to Philadelphia police. Testimony in the Ramos case showed the man was fed only four times while held in the closet for about two months, and was removed from the tiny space only ""six or seven times"" during his captivity. ""When he finally died of malnutrition, the sisters wheeled him in a baby carriage to an abandoned building where he was discovered two days later,"" one of the documents states. It was not immediately clear which sisters the documents referred to. The court documents show Weston was initially found incompetent to stand trial. Two years later, after being hospitalized, she was certified by the court and found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and criminal conspiracy, according to Philadelphia police and court documents. The court found she ""was legally sane"" at the time she held Ramos captive and ""had the full intent to conspire"" with her siblings when she directed them to dispose of the body. The current investigation into Weston and her alleged co-conspirators has taken several bizarre twists as authorities try to piece together the evidence in the case, which has spread to at least two other states after detectives discovered that one of the accused had traveled across state lines with the people found in the boiler room. Police said Wednesday that Weston, 47-year-old Gregory Thomas, 49-year-old Eddie Wright and 32-year-old Jean McIntosh, Weston's daughter, may have been holding seven other people, including Weston's 19-year-old niece, who showed signs of torture and abuse. Authorities are also looking into whether some of the victims' Social Security checks had been stolen. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told CNN on Monday that Weston had IDs for about 50 people in her possession: ""Social Security information, power of attorney information, those kinds of things."" The case continued to develop Friday when CNN uncovered new information that shows the Philadelphia case was not the first time Weston has drawn scrutiny for possible Social Security fraud. The Social Security Administration's Office of Inspector General confirmed to CNN that it investigated Weston in 2009 for continuing to collect benefits for her roommate, Maxine Lee, after she died of acute meningitis. When the administration finally cut off benefits, Weston appeared at a Philadelphia office seeking to have the benefits reinstated, the Office of Inspector General said in a statement to CNN. The money -- totaling less then $3,000 -- was repaid to the Social Security Administration, the inspector general said. The acknowledgment by the inspector general's office has raised questions about why the Social Security Administration allowed Weston, a convicted murderer, to serve as a ""representative payee"" for a Social Security recipient. Under Social Security Administration policy, certain individuals convicted of criminal offenses are prohibited from serving as representative payees. The Social Security Administration has begun reviewing its handling of Weston. After initially asking for questions for comment in writing from CNN, a spokeswoman for the administration declined to provide details of the Weston case, including whether Weston was the representative payee for any of the people found in captivity in Philadelphia. ""We are very concerned about this situation. As this is an ongoing investigation, we can't provide you any details at this time,"" spokeswoman Kia Green said. Meanwhile, police in Norfolk, Virginia, are taking a fresh look at Lee's death in light of the Philadelphia case. According to police, Weston, who was caring for Lee, reported her death on November 13, 2008. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be acute bacterial meningitis. The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy said a contributing factor in Lee's death was ""cachexia of unknown origin,"" or malnutrition. The manner of death is listed as ""natural causes."" Norfolk police spokesman Chris Amos said investigators have not yet decided to formally reopen the Lee case. The physician who conducted Lee's autopsy has reviewed the autopsy report and ""hasn't come to any other conclusions"" about the cause of death, said Glenn McBride, spokesman for the Tidewater office of the Virginia Medical Examiner's Office. ""We're waiting to hear from the police if anything needs to be done by our department."" At the time of Lee's death, police say they did not know that Weston had served time for murder. The department did not conduct a murder investigation because the death was ruled natural, Amos said. Sarah Hoye reported from Philadelphia. Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt reported from New York. Mike M. Ahlers reported from Washington.","Alleged ringleader in case was convicted of starving to death her sister's boyfriend in 1981 .

"(CNN) -- It's an idea that sits uncomfortably with tennis greats Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer but for the Madrid Open and their clay-court revolution, blue is the new red. The 2012 installment of the $10.6 million tournament in the Spanish capital will be the first time an officially sanctioned Tour event will be played on a blue clay court -- a departure from the traditional red associated most closely with the French Open and Roland Garros. It is the brainchild of Ion Tiriac, a former player who won a French Open doubles title in 1970, who is convinced the switch of colors will benefit the sport's star players and spectators watching in person and on television. The blue clay is made exactly the same way as the red, with specially dyed bricks being ground into tiny fragments, before two different layers are spread over the court. Tiriac also pioneered the first blue hard courts and says the switch to blue clay is a logical step. ""On the blue court, the contrast is much better,"" he told CNN. ""I'm sure the spectators are going to say, 'Wow, we can see the ball better.' It's proved scientifically the ball and the contrast is at least 15 per cent better on the blue than the red. ""I spent a lot of time thinking about the game, thinking about how can you be better, not only for the players, who are the most important thing on the court, but also for the viewers."" Tiriac's idea has been years in the making and involved prolonged consultation with the men's ATP Tour, the women's WTA Tour and the International Tennis Federation. The blue clay has been ratified for use in 2012 and could become a permanent feature of the Madrid Open if organizers can satisfy the authorities, spectators, television companies and crucially, the players, come May. But there must already be some trepidation in Madrid given that two of the game's biggest stars, who have a total of 26 grand slams between them, have already registered their skepticism. Nadal Tweeted: ""It's a shame because of the history and tradition of this surface. I hope I don't have to play one day on blue grass."" Federer said: ""This is a long story, but I find it sad that you have to play on a surface the players don't accept. I find it sad that a player like Rafa, at a tournament in his own country, has had to fight against a surface that does not want to play on."" But Tiriac is convinced that once the pair have road tested Madrid's new color scheme, they will be converted. He said: ""As far as Nadal and Federer, they are great players and great human beings, I respect their opinion but I don't have to accept everything one player says. ""This is a sport that is here for 100 years and is hopefully going to go another 100 years, I'm sure if they are going to play on it they will come to the right conclusion."" Tiriac says the new surface has been trialled on players in Spain's Davis Cup team and two-time major champion Marat Safin, all of whom gave the blue clay the green light. He said: ""We tested this all over three or four years ago and the players all said the clay plays the same only it is different color and you see the ball better."" Traditionalists are also yet to be swayed by Madrid's bold declaration that blue is the new red, with many iconic images of past tournaments showing players' pristine white outfits slowly becoming cloaked in red clay. Tiriac acknowledges the cost is almost double that of the red clay but says the extra expense is worth it. He also admits improving the experience for television viewers is a major factor in the switch. ""It's very difficult to make changes, tennis makes very little change compared to other sports,"" Tiriac added. ""To accept something new it is not easy but once you prove it is going to improve the game, people slowly accept it. ""We are dependable -- I don't want to say slaves to television -- but we are dependable on them and having the possibility to improve it for the television is instrumental.""","The 2012 Madrid Open is set to become the first tennis tournament to be staged on blue clay .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Sony expects a full year net loss of US $2.9 billion, citing tough domestic and global financial conditions. The Japanese electronics company says it is forecasting a net loss of 220 billion yen or US $2.9 billion for the fiscal year ending in March 2012. Previously, Sony expected to make 90 billion yen (US $1.2 billion). Releasing its third quarter earnings, Sony says for the quarter ending in December 2011, it lost 159 billion yen (US $2.06 billion). And for the nine months ending in December 2011, Sony reported a net income loss of 201 billion yen (US $2.5 billion). Sony cited a number of factors for the deteriorating outlook, like the appreciation of the Japanese yen and the flooding in Thailand. The release of the grim financial news came just shortly before the first press conference of the soon to be new head of Sony, Kazuo Hirai, and the outgoing CEO and president Howard Stringer.","Sony cites tough domestic and global financial conditions .

"(CNN) -- Russia will not deliver new weapons to Syria so long as the situation in that country is unstable, an official at the body in charge of monitoring Russia's arms trade said Monday, state media reported. ""Russia, as well as other countries, is concerned by the situation in Syria,"" said Vyacheslav Dzirkaln, deputy head of the Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, RIA Novosti reported. ""We are not talking about new arms supplies to that country."" ""Until the situation stabilizes we will not deliver any new weapons (to Syria),"" said Dzirkaln. He specifically said Russia would not supply Syria with Yak-130 aircraft. Russia has signed a $550 million contract for the delivery of three dozen such planes, RIA Novosti said. Still, it was not clear whether the official was saying Russia would discontinue the delivery of all arms, or whether it was stopping just the supply of ""new weapons."" The report seemed to leave open the possibility that Russia could continue to deliver some arms to Syria under existing contracts. The move could be a major blow to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is fighting to stay in control after more than a year of popular protests and a brutal government crackdown. Russia has been the long-time principal supplier of arms to Syria since the days when it was the Soviet Union. The weapons sales have more than doubled in recent years. According to Congressional Research Service, Russia sold Syria $4.7 billion in arms from 2007 to 2010, compared with $2.1 billion from 2003 to 2006. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last month the continued supply of arms from Russia has strengthened al-Assad's regime, despite denials by Russian President Vladimir Putin that any munitions it was providing to Syria were being used against its own people. Also last month, a shipment of refurbished Russian helicopters headed for Syria had to turn around and return to Russia after its British insurance company dropped coverage on the ship carrying the helicopters. News of the suspended shipments comes the same day the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria said al-Assad has agreed on ""an approach"" to ending the bloodshed in Syria. Kofi Annan made the statement after meeting with al-Assad in Damascus. He then flew to Tehran for meetings with Iranian leaders about the Syrian conflict. Annan gave no details of the ""approach"" al-Assad agreed to but said he vowed to share it with the ""armed opposition."" Annan also said al-Assad ""reassured me of the government's commitment"" to Annan's six-point peace plan, brokered in March, which has done nothing to stop the deadly violence. Syria said the two men discussed a recent gathering of world leaders in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at taking steps to bring peace to Syria, ""with emphasis on the need for dialogue to be among Syrians and led by Syrians"" -- a phrase emphasizing Syria's resistance to foreign intervention of any sort in the conflict. Later, Annan announced he was in Tehran ""to discuss the situation in Syria"" and ""to see how we can work together to help settle the situation."" Iran's state-run Press TV said he planned to ""hold talks with senior officials."" Even as Annan was in Syria, al-Assad's regime reported it had conducted live-fire training exercises that simulated a defense against foreign attacks. Throughout the 16-month uprising, the regime has blamed violence on armed terrorist groups involving people from outside Syria. At least 41 people were killed Monday as the Syrian regime continued its crackdown, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria opposition group. It said at least 60 people were killed in fighting Sunday. Monday's violence included house-to-house raids and arrests in Daraa and ""very intense shelling"" in Homs, with helicopters flying overhead, the LCC said. Eighteen of the deaths were in Idlib, the LCC said. Gruesome video from the town of Areeha in Idlib showed blood-soaked bodies being dumped onto pickup trucks amid apparent destruction. A man is heard yelling, ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is great"") and calling the dead ""victims of the indiscriminate shelling."" As with so many other videos that have emerged from the conflict, it was impossible to know the full story behind the images. Heavy gunfire also erupted Monday in the northern Lebanese state of Akkar near the border with Syria, the official Lebanese news agency reported. A number of shells fell inside Lebanese territory, it said. CNN can not independently confirm reports of violence as Syria has severely limited the access of international journalists. Syrian state-run TV, meanwhile, broadcast what it called ""confessions of four terrorists who admitted to committing murder, rape, abduction and robbery, in addition to smuggling weapons and gunmen, in Homs' countryside."" The so-called confessions aired Sunday, state-run news agency SANA reported Monday. It said one of the terrorists ""started off by being part of a group that attempted to incite people to protest, and his job was to transport protesters from mosques to squares in the town of al-Qseir."" SANA reported that on Monday, authorities ""clashed with an armed terrorist group"" on the outskirts of Aleppo. The United Nations says more than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the violence in Syria. Opposition groups give an even higher figure. The violence erupted in March 2011 when Syrian forces launched a brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrations, part of the Arab Spring that swept through several countries. While members of the U.N. Security Council, which includes the United States, have called for an end to the violence and for al-Assad to step aside, efforts to adopt a resolution that would allow for aid to the rebels have been blocked by Russia and China, key Syrian trade partners. Russia and China are strongly opposed to armed intervention, saying the outcome in Syria should be decided by its people. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: Heavy gunfire erupts at Syria-Lebanon border, official Lebanese news agency says .

"(CNN) -- Sophisticated fun commands the style scene in Boston and just a stroll down Newbury Street can inspire anyone to dress their best. The fashionable streets were encouragement enough for Martini Severin to begin her style blog, BeyondBostonChic.com, and Severin remains pleasantly surprised by the looks she captures daily. ""The camera in a lot of ways is a passport to getting to know people,"" Severin said. ""I chat with them, learn more about what motivates them sartorially and how they put what they're wearing together. There is no better way to get to know a city than through its residents. The blog has been successful because it's easy to talk to people and hear what it is about this town that makes them sing."" After admiring the stylish residents of Boston for three years, Severin was appalled to learn that GQ's latest poll called it the ""worst dressed city in America."" Severin believes the classy looks with trendy intimations build a sophisticated look for the city and its neighborhoods. ""It's casual sophistication,"" Severin said. ""It's not as high fashion as what you would see in other cities. So it's practical -- but practical with whimsy."" Below, Severin details the diverse elements of Boston street style. CNN: Describe what you see on Boston's streets? Severin: Style here is really chic, sophisticated and very diverse. People have flair, but in a very different way than any other major city. It's about the little, little details that really amount to a tableau that is just seamless. It's wonderful to see how the city changes with each season. I was walking the other day and it was like, ""Wow, everyone looks so good -- what do I shoot?"" The exuberance for style is here in the city and it's alive. Double the style in the Twin Cities . CNN: How do residents remain sartorial in the winter? Severin: It's beautiful in the spring, summer, fall, but in the winter, it's not unlikely that we'll have 17 feet of snow lying on the city. I find that it becomes really difficult to keep your zeal and dress well when you have to put on layers upon layers of clothes. If you need to keep warm, you have to have a fabulous coat. People will have coats that are flower print, plaid, the most beautiful white mohair, and even wear capes. They're really resourceful in finding a coat that will speak to their personality and sense of style. You spend so much of your time in your winter coat, you always want to find something that says a little bit of something about yourself. Dressing up in Dallas . CNN: What trends are you seeing in Boston right now? Severin: You'll see people wearing scarves with polka dots or plaid. We are wholeheartedly loving stripes here in Boston, so everyone is wearing nautical stripes. We're also sun lovers like any other city, so the sandals you see on the street are fabulous -- the strappier the better. CNN: Is there a local designer scene in Boston? Where are people shopping? Severin: There's a movement to shop local in Boston. We have a lot of little boutiques. Newbury Street is our equivalent of Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive. I personally love the smaller stores. I go and they know who I am. It's the kind of city where it's big but it's also small where you can form relationships. Several boutiques are quite popular. Mint Julep -- they sell the prettiest dresses. Then there's a boutique downtown called Flock. It's a mother and daughter team and they personally chose each of the pieces that are in the store. They work with very small, unknown designers and bring their merchandise to Boston to introduce it to a greater audience. There is also a shop, largely for men, called Uniform, that is very nice. There is also quite a vintage culture here in Boston. One store, Bobby From Boston, was started by this man that collects vintage clothing and film wardrobe designers frequent his store and warehouse. It's a privilege to be invited to his warehouse and shop from there. Colorful layers of style on Chicago's streets . CNN: What's coming up for the Boston scene? Severin: Starting September 19, I have an exhibit that's really a great way to say ""Ha!"" to GQ. It's showcasing about 60 of the photos that I've taken through the three years that I've been running the blog and basically, it's the best of Boston and the surrounding areas: Cambridge, Jamaica Plain, Dorchester, Somerville. I feel like it's going to be a really good show in terms of what we have to offer. That coincides with Boston Fashion Week as well, which starts September 23. I feel like the winds are changing in Boston. There are a lot more people who are focused on style here than there used to be. Everyone is doing their part to let the world know, ""We dress well... and we know it.""

"(CNN) -- Hated by the English Premier League champions, chastised by the UK's Prime Minister and even lampooned by a pizza company -- is Luis Suarez the number one enemy to English football? If the Uruguayan had not already secured his place as the ""Enfant Terrible"" of the English game then he now has that role all wrapped up. As Suarez sank his teeth into the flesh of Branislav Ivanovic, he put paid to the old adage of ""once bitten, twice shy."" No sooner had the Liverpool striker been handed a 10-game ban for his meal on Merseyside than the entire footballing world began a furious debate over the severity of the punishment. ""The FA should explain how they've come to 10 games,"" Rory Smith, football writer at The Times newspaper speaking before the FA released the reasoning behind their decision, told CNN. ""If they've taken his past transgressions into account then that's understandable, but by not explaining they're allowing for lots of speculation and conspiracy. ""They could have given seven matches, which is the same as the Dutch FA so it would be interesting to see their reasoning. ""It's unusual for past offenses to be taken into account and perhaps there is a thought that they have something against Suarez. ""The problem they have now is that next time there is a reckless challenge which goes over the top of the ball and hurts a player, what are they going to do? ""Are they saying biting is worse?"" Suarez is no saint. That much has been clear ever since that infamous handball at the 2010 World Cup which deprived Ghana of a place in the semifinal and earned him a red card and his country a place in the last four. Then there was the episode where he was labeled as the ""Cannibal of Amsterdam"" after he was hit with a seven match ban for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal's shoulder during a match in November 2010. His reputation was tarnished further when he was given an eight-match suspension and a $63,000 fine after being found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing Patrice Evra. After Sunday's game, Suarez, 26, was quick to apologize for his antics and would have hoped for a lesser sentence. But he appears to have found himself in the unenviable role of English football's hate figure. One company in the UK has even brought out a Suarez pizza where customers are invited to bite into his face, which is shaped with various toppings. The Uruguayan has won few friends outside of Anfield, despite riding high in the English Premier League goalscoring charts with 23 so far this season. His constant niggling away at defenders, his penchant for diving around the penalty area and his often childish behavior has riled opponents and opposing fans. But this latest incident, which occurred during last Sunday's 2-2 draw with Chelsea at Anfield has caused outrage both within and outside the realms of sport. Such was the outcry at Suarez's actions that even British Prime Minister David Cameron felt compelled to offer his opinion on the matter. ""It is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider,"" a Downing Street spokesman said. ""As part of their consideration, I think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high-profile players are often role models."" In a statement issued by the FA on Wednesday, the organization which runs the English game insisted that ""a suspension of three matches was clearly insufficient and the player will serve a further seven first-team matches in addition to the standard three."" Liverpool, which has until midday on Friday to respond, has already criticized the decision and the severity of the ban. Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre told the club's official site: ""Both the club and player are shocked and disappointed at the severity of today's Independent Regulatory Commission decision. ""We await the written reasons tomorrow before making any further comment."" What rankles with many critics of the ban is that it appears out of proportion when compared to punishments handed out for similar offenses. Writing on the CNN World Sport Facebook page, Jason Noblit said: ""It should have been five games. No doubt he deserves to be punished, but the FA is too happy to demonstrate it has double standards for players like Suarez."" But others disagreed with Moustafa Ali adding: I think they gave him the right punishment , especially he has blemish record against other players like Evra and Bakkal."" During a Premier League game in 2006, Tottenham's Jermain Defoe was shown just a yellow card for biting Javier Mascherano, then playing for West Ham United. At the time, an FA spokesman said: ""We are unable to take any action because the referee has already dealt with the incident. ""FIFA regulations prevent us from taking retrospective action."" Suarez's ban is also longer than that of former Manchester City defender Ben Thatcher, who was suspended for eight games after his elbow on Pedro Mendes left the player unconscious. The FA also issued a further 15-match ban suspended for two years, while the club fined him six weeks wages and prohibited him from playing for six weeks . Suarez's ban is by no means the most severe handed out by the FA. In 1998, current Sunderland manager Paolo Di Canio was banned for 11 games after pushing a referee while playing for Sheffield Wednesday. Five years later, Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand was suspended for eight months after missing a drugs test. Another Manchester United star, Eric Cantona, was banned for nine months after launching a kung-fu style kick at a supporter during a game at Crystal Palace in 1995. Di Canio, Ferdinand and Cantona all went on to enjoy successful Premier League careers, despite their off-field problems. Suarez could yet follow suit with his name on the shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year Award -- voted on by his peers -- which will be handed out on Sunday. And if he does pick up the prestigious trophy, you can be assured that there will be the gnashing of teeth around the football world.","Luis Suarez hit with 10-game ban for biting by Football Association .

"Kabul (CNN) -- A Taliban-affiliated website published on Sunday what it claimed was a leaked document containing confidential government security plans for a vital meeting of tribal elders in Kabul next week, one that is set to discuss Afghanistan's long-term relationship with the United States and possible peace talks with the insurgency. The plans included a detailed satellite map of the area and purported details of the security arrangements, but the Afghan Interior Ministry immediately dismissed them as fake. The tribal elder meeting -- or loya jirga -- is considered by many an important step in harnessing Afghan consent to both a long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and any possible peace deal with elements of the insurgency. It is due to begin Wednesday and continue for several days; hundreds of community leaders have been invited from across the country. Their conclusions will likely influence Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The Taliban have long threatened to disrupt the event. Sunday's alleged leak was interpreted in Kabul as anything from a desperate insurgency resorting to fraudulent propaganda to a new sign of the Taliban's enhanced ability to elicit confidential information from government ministries. Regardless, they are a sign of the information war between coalition forces and the insurgency, both of which regularly trade blows and accusations on social media. A translated statement on the website read: ""The vigilant Mujahedeen of Islamic Emirate have acquired the security plans, maps and other documents related to the upcoming supposed loya jirga (National . Assembly) by means of its personnel embedded inside the enemy ranks."" The Interior Ministry dismissed the post, saying it only served as part of a failing propaganda campaign aimed at intimidating people from attending the loya jirga. ""This is yet another huge lie by the Taliban,"" said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi. ""It is part of a propaganda campaign and it is what we can expect. The Taliban are under pressure -- they have tried to disrupt and have failed to do so. That is why they are resorting to this propaganda."" He rejected the notion of jirga delegates due avoiding the meeting because of the alleged leak. The document said the following could be ""probable threats"" posed by the Taliban: . -- ""Suicide attacks with new and dangerous tactics in one or several places continuing for several hours""; . -- ""Rocket attacks from Kabul city sub-districts or districts outside""; . -- ""Infiltration of enemy into the lines of security forces."" The statement on the website also said, ""These important secrets which you will see in the below pages have been acquired by Mujahedeen of Islamic Emirate from two ministries and from the special security corps of the government. Our upcoming attacks will become even more lethal and precise with the acquisition of such intelligence material, if God wills it."" The statement went on to promise further details: ""Note -- The original security plans which consist of 28 pages and six pictorial maps have been recomposed and rewritten by us for intelligence and policy purposes. We will release the second, third, 28th sides of the plan and a map to show its validation and will also release the pictorial part of it in the near future, if Allah Wills it."" NATO's International Security Assistance Force was aware of the message on the website, but could not confirm the accuracy of it, spokesman Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings said. ""The Taliban have said they would go to all extremes to disrupt the loya jirga,"" he said.","The Taliban says it has detailed security plans of upcoming meeting with tribal elders .
The government has dismissed the Taliban's claims .
The meeting, known as the loya jirga, is considered significant .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong's billionaire properties are the most expensive in the world, according to global real estate firm, Savills. ""Ultra-prime"" properties in Hong Kong cost £7,200 per square foot ($10,880) on average, Savills said in its latest World Cities Review report, which compares property prices for top luxury homes. Other Asia Pacific cities dominated the ranking, with Tokyo, Shanghai, Singapore, Mumbai and Sydney all among the top 10 most expensive cities to buy luxury property in 2012. Real estate values worldwide doubled in the last seven years, with large increases seen in China and Asia, thanks to the emergence of new wealthy classes and rising commodity prices, the report said. Singapore and Mumbai experienced the highest growth in property prices since 2005, with a growth of 232% and 176%, respectively. Tokyo had the slowest growth at 8%. ""The activity of billionaires in international real estate markets reflects the creation of global wealth and the economic success of particular regions and cities,"" the report said. ""This means that the cities in newly emerged economies have significantly outperformed those in the 'old world' economies of the U.S., Japan, Australia and Europe."" READ MORE: Report: U.S., China dominate global billionaires . New York stands out among world cities as ""particularly good value"" for residential properties, ""especially from an income return point of view,"" according to the report.

""Only London's ultra-prime market stands out among the 'old world' cities as having shown significant growth since 2005, totaling 107%,"" the report said. Real estate costs for businesses are cheapest in Mumbai, with Sydney offering the best value for money. ""We may well see Sydney becoming an increasingly global city as it proves attractive to new and expanding business on the Pacific Rim,"" the report said.

The report also looked at leisure resort areas -- like Cap Ferrat in France, Alibag in India and Phuket, Thailand -- which lag in values compared to urban properties but have the most potential for growth, according to Savills. ""Billionaire activity has been concentrated on high-end urban centers rather than leisure properties in the surrounding countryside or regional sunbelts,"" said Yolande Barnes, head of world research at Savills. ""This reflects a global preference for urban locations as these billionaires need to be located in cities where they can do business.""

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- Many questions remain 31 days after a school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, shocked the nation. But what's clear is that the pain remains powerfully visible throughout the community. And the force of that anguish is loud enough to echo throughout Washington's halls of power. As authorities investigate why 20-year-old Adam Lanza gunned down 27 people, including 20 children, there's no clear consensus in Newtown about how to move forward. But many residents are calling for stricter gun control, including a ban on so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, used in many mass shootings. Newtown police Chief Michael Kehoe told NBC that he favors a ban on assault weapons and restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines. Emotions remain raw. ""There is still a lot of pain, a lot of grief,"" said Rick Scinto, a deacon at St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church, which lost nine of its youngest members at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He acknowledged that the pain ""might not ever go away."" Read more: Connecticut governor orders review of gun laws . Down the street from the school, at a place where a makeshift memorial once stood, a bouquet now marks the spot. The memorial has been dismantled, composted and preserved for a permanent memorial. Hanging from an overpass, a huge banner filled with signatures reads, ""We are with you, Newtown."" The banner is a gift from Tucson, Arizona, where a mass shooting two years ago killed six people and seriously wounded then-Rep. Gabby Giffords. Sandy Hook students returned to class this month in the nearby town of Monroe, at Chalk Hill Middle School, while investigators comb the crime scene. Chalk Hill has been outfitted with rugs and furniture that would be familiar and comforting to Sandy Hook students. Security measures have also been increased, with more cameras and locks. What will Newtown do with the school itself? Some have proposed tearing down the scene of the unspeakable crime and transforming it into something positive. ""I don't want to see the land and the building stay empty and broken,"" one parent said during a town hall meeting Sunday night. ""I want to do something with it, whether it be a memorial park"" or ""a new safer school with top security."" The tragedy is so profound that recent polling suggests it may have shifted public opinion and re-energized discussions about how far the Second Amendment should extend. The family of 6-year-old victim Noah Pozner has contacted the White House to discuss gun laws and potential reforms. In Washington, the Newtown tragedy has largely set a new tone -- and triggered a new battle. The nation's largest gun lobby is gearing up for one of its most potent challenges in years. ""We are mobilizing for a fight,"" said National Rifle Association President David Keene. A federal task force led by Vice President Joe Biden -- which met with the NRA, gun control advocates and numerous other groups -- is set to deliver recommendations to President Barack Obama on Tuesday. Obama openly shed tears in the shootings' aftermath and has vowed to make curbing gun violence a ""central issue"" at the start of his second term. ""There is no single answer,"" said Biden, who in 1994 helped pass an assault weapons ban that expired a decade later. Biden has publicly mentioned homing in on things like universal background checks and reviews of mental health policies as part of his possible recommendations to decrease gun-related deaths. 'Criminals and madmen' But Keene said his meeting last week with the vice president left him ""disappointed,"" with little perceived ground for compromise. ""We will not allow law-abiding gun owners to be blamed for the acts of criminals and madmen,"" the NRA said in a statement after the meeting. The group is preparing a new ad campaign to fend off certain gun regulations. Governors in states like Connecticut, New York and Colorado have called for tighter restrictions and extensive background checks during firearms sales. Other states like Alaska, Arizona and Montana have sought to pass legislation that would exempt them from stricter federal regulations. ""The gun issue will be prominent in a lot of states,"" said Bill Pound, executive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""Whether there will be action taken is another question. If experience is any guide, there will be far more bills introduced than enacted."" The city of Burlington, Vermont, sought to get tougher on the kind of weapon used in the Sandy Hook shootings, passing a resolution that could lead to a ban on certain rifles and high-capacity magazines. Sandy Hook Promise . In Newtown, a group of residents plan to mark the month that has passed by unveiling a grass-roots campaign to prevent similar tragedies. The group calls itself the Sandy Hook Promise, formerly Newtown United. It aims to ""identify and implement holistic, common sense solutions that will make our community and our country safer from similar acts of violence through education, outreach and grass-roots discussion,"" according to its website. ""It is unfortunate that we need tragedies to address problems,"" said Brookings Institution fellow John Hudak, who grew up roughly 10 miles from Sandy Hook. ""It has been true across the world in responses to terrorism, in the improvement of disease prevention, in the testing of pharmaceuticals and even in the growth and development of democracy."" Interactive: Remembering the victims . Regulations and Legislation . After Newtown, several congressional lawmakers promised to introduce tougher gun-control measures. On the first day of the new session, lawmakers in the House of Representatives introduced nearly a dozen bills related to gun violence. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, has sponsored legislation that would require background checks for all gun sales -- including at gun shows -- and ban online sales of ammunition. In the Senate, one such bill is the Fix Gun Checks Act, which attempts to address the ""gun-show loophole"" and requires criminal background checks for all firearms sales, rather than just licensed dealers. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, announced that he planned to introduce legislation requiring background checks to purchase ammunition. ""Ammunition is now the black hole in gun violence prevention,"" he said, pointing to laws on bullet sales that permit exchanges without background reviews. Some are pushing for a new ban on ""assault weapons"" to include other types of military-style weapons and those with high-capacity magazines. The NRA opposes such a ban, saying it won't help and infringes on Second Amendment rights. In Connecticut, Gov. Dannel Malloy last week bluntly rejected the notion, espoused by the NRA, of putting more guns in classrooms as protection. All states except Illinois allow at least some limited ability to carry a concealed weapon in public, often requiring ""good cause"" by an individual before a permit is issued. Four states -- Vermont, Arizona, Alaska and Wyoming -- do not require any permit for a concealed weapon. Gun sales surge, buybacks gain popularity . December set a record for the number of background checks for gun buyers during a single month, according to the FBI. It's an indictator of the rising sales of firearms. And yet gun buyback programs have also gained popularity in Newtown's aftermath, with events springing up across the country, at times privately sponsored. Tell us: Would your gun fall under the '94 weapons ban? School safety . After the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in 1999 and at Virginia Tech in 2007, calls for more school security sounded as the public sought to find ways to prevent mass violence from reaching students. After the Newtown massacre, a similar phenomenon got under way as schools added cameras, locks and ran extra drills. And yet most schools already have some form of a functioning crisis plan, noted Kenneth Trump, a school security consultant. ""I don't believe we need to throw out the book of best practices on school safety,"" he said. ""I think we do need to focus our resources, times and conversation back on the fundamentals."" In their effort to protect both patients and the public, health advocates are calling on legislators to take a closer look at the nation's mental health care system in the wake of the Newtown tragedy. And a glance at the numbers offers some insight into the extent of the issue. One quarter of adults suffer from a ""diagnosable mental disorder in a given year,"" while 6% of U.S. adults have what can be considered a ""serious mental illness,"" according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Research conducted at the Centers for Disease Control also indicates that 3.4% of noninstitutionalized adults suffer from ""serious psychological distress"" in a given month.

"(CNN) -- Another round of severe weather threatened America's heartland on Tuesday, with tornado watches posted across parts of Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Kansas. At least one tornado touched down in north-central Kansas on Tuesday afternoon, causing damage to some homes and power lines in the rural area, the National Weather Service reported. Six farms in and around Corning, Kansas, were struck, one of which was completely destroyed, said Nemaha County emergency manager Todd Swart. ""I imagine there are some dead hogs,"" Swart said Tuesday night, ""but we have no reports of (human) injuries or deaths. We are still working to restore power."" Firefighters went out to assess another reported tornado 6 miles east in Goff but didn't come across any damage, according to Swart. A tornado's heading your way: Now what? Later on Tuesday evening, strong winds -- which National Weather Service reports said may have been a tornado, though local police said they were more likely the result of potent straight-line winds -- caused damage near Waterford, Pennsylvania. This northwestern Pennsylvania town is about 15 miles south of Erie. The storms came a day after straight-line winds of up to 80 mph whipped the Springfield, Illinois, area. A microburst spawned by a severe thunderstorm damaged about 70 trailers. Oklahoma: One week later . ""The damage occurred from debris. Tree limbs at a height of 10 to 20 feet were broken and they damaged the roofs of the mobile homes,"" said David Butt, director of the Sangamon County Office of Emergency Management. ""No roofs were torn off. No roofs were peeled back. The only damage to roofs was being penetrated by wind-blown debris."" One person suffered a minor laceration in the process, Butt said. Opinion: Tornado risk goes beyond the 'Alley' The weather service's Storm Prediction Center is forecasting even more severe weather on Wednesday. Areas most likely to see such conditions include much of central Oklahoma, Nebraska and Kansas. This will most likely occur in the form of severe thunderstorms, though the forecast notes there's also a greater probability than usual of ""large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes.""

"(CNN) -- The senior Haqqani network leader in Afghanistan, Haji Mali Khan, was captured during a joint NATO-Afghan forces operation, the International Security Assistance Force said Saturday. Khan was captured Tuesday in Jani Khel district, in Paktiya province, ISAF said. ""This is the arrest of a leading figure of the Haqqani clan,"" ISAF spokesman Gen. Carsten Jacobson said. ""It is a considerable blow against the Haqqani network."" The Haqqani insurgent network is widely regarded as one of the most effective militant groups in Afghanistan. Western intelligence officials believe the Haqqanis were involved in the assassination this month of Burhanuddin Rabbani, the chairman of Afghanistan's High Peace Council, and a June attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul. The group has not yet been labeled a terrorist group, but the United States is close to adding it to its terror list. U.S. officials say they are in the final formal review of that process. The White House praised the capture in a statement Saturday. ""We congratulate the Afghan and ISAF forces for capturing the Haqqani network's senior commander in Afghanistan, Haji Mali Khan, a key Haqqani leader who facilitated cross-border attacks against our troops,"" White House National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. Khan is the uncle of Siraj and Badruddin Haqqani -- the brothers who lead the network -- and worked directly under Siraj, managing bases and overseeing operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan, ISAF said. Although he was arrested Tuesday, his capture was not announced until Saturday because it took a few days to confirm his identity, NATO spokesman Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings said. Khan moved forces from Pakistan to Afghanistan to conduct terrorist activity, ISAF said. According to ISAF, Khan in the past year established a militant camp in Paktiya province, transferred money to insurgents and help them acquire supplies. He was heavily armed, but surrendered without incident, ISAF said. ""Haji Mali Khan is a very important member of the Haqqani network. He was an active fighter for the group but also he was helping (Siraj) Haqqani in his administrate work,"" said Muhammad Amin, a former member of Afghanistan's security council and an influential leader in the region. ""Whenever Siraj would be busy or away, Mali Khan would attend the meetings for (him). I think it is quite significant that he has been arrested and for sure Mali Khan has lots of information."" The Haqqani network was founded by Siraj Haqqani's father with Pakistani backing to fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Still today, the group is believed to maintain ties with Pakistan's military intelligence, the ISI. Many of the Haqqani targets have an Indian connection, signs of that association with the ISI. The links between the ISI and Haqqanis is ""very well known,"" former joint chiefs chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, who retired Friday, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria. ""I have argued for the need to sever this link,"" he said, adding that the discussion was not a new one for U.S. officials. The United States has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Siraj Haqqani. The U.K. Foreign Office praised the capture of Khan. ""As a senior commander within the Haqqani network, his removal from the battlefield will deal a major blow to one of the most dangerous terrorist networks operating in Afghanistan,"" said Alistair Burt, foreign office minister for Middle East affairs. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Tim Lister, Jessica Yellin and journalist Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed to this report.","Haji Mali Khan is the senior leader in Afghanistan for the Haqqani network .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Call it an amazing example of entrepreneurship or a daring play of deceit. After a U.S.-based ""critical infrastructure"" company discovered in 2012 its computer systems were being accessed from China, its security personnel caught the culprit ultimately responsible: Not a hacker from the Middle Kingdom but one of the company's own employees sitting right at his desk in the United States. The software developer is simply referred to as ""Bob,"" according to a case study by the U.S. telecommunications firm Verizon Business. Bob was an ""inoffensive and quiet"" programmer in his mid-40's, according to his employee profile, with ""a relatively long tenure with the company"" and ""someone you wouldn't look at twice in an elevator."" Those innocuous traits led investigators to initially believe the computer access from China using Bob's credentials was unauthorized -- and that some form of malware was sidestepping strong two-factor authentication that included a token RSA key fob under Bob's name. Investigators then discovered Bob had ""physically FedExed his RSA token to China so that the third-party contractor could log-in under his credentials during the workday,"" wrote Andrew Valentine, a senior forensic investigator for Verizon. Bob had hired a programming firm in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang to do his work. His helpers half a world away worked overnight on a schedule imitating an average 9-to-5 workday in the United States. He paid them one-fifth of his six-figure salary, according to Verizon. And over the past several years, Bob received excellent performance reviews of his ""clean, well written"" coding. He had even been noted as ""the best developer in the building."" A forensic image of Bob's workstation revealed his true work habits and typical day: . 9:00 a.m. -- Get to work, surf Reddit, watch cat videos . 11:30 a.m. -- Lunch . 1:00 p.m. -- Ebay . 2:00 p.m or so -- Facebook and LinkedIn . 4:30 p.m. -- Send end-of-day e-mail update to management . 5:00 p.m. -- Go home . The Verizon investigation suggested Bob's entrepreneurial outsourcing spirit stretched across several companies in his area -- netting him several hundred thousand dollars a year as he paid out about $50,000 a year to his China-based ghost writers, according to hundreds of PDF invoices also discovered on his work computer. Verizon's Valentine told CNN via e-mail that Bob ""was in fact terminated at the conclusion of the investigation."" Presumably Bob's Chinese helpers were as well.","U.S.-based company discovered its computer systems were being accessed from China .

"(CNN) -- A New York man who police believe killed his wife and daughters in a Maryland hotel room may have been involved in ""questionable financial dealings,"" authorities said Wednesday. Stephanie Parente, 19, was found dead along with her sister and parents in a Baltimore hotel Monday. The bodies of William Parente, 59; his wife, Betty, 58; and their daughters Stephanie, 19, and Catherine, 11, were found Monday in a room at the Sheraton Hotel in Towson, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb. Evidence indicates Betty Parente and the two daughters died from blunt-force trauma and asphyxiation, said Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson. William Parente committed suicide by cutting himself, he said. ""Baltimore County Police has learned of allegations that William Parente may be involved in questionable financial dealings,"" Johnson said. Authorities previously have said Parente was an attorney. The family was from Garden City, New York, but Stephanie Parente was a student at Loyola College in Baltimore, and police said the family visited her there occasionally. William Parente, his wife and their younger daughter had checked into the Sheraton on April 15. They were due to check out Monday, Johnson said, but failed to do so. One of Stephanie Parente's roommates called the hotel room around midnight, Hill said. CNN affiliate WMAR reported that the roommate was calling to see if Stephanie Parente was coming back to campus. William Parente answered the phone and told the roommate his daughter would be staying with her family for the night. Authorities believe the three females were dead at the time of the phone call, Hill said. The bodies were found Monday after a housekeeper told hotel management about 3 p.m. that the door to the room was locked and there had been no response from inside, county police spokesman Bill Toohey said Monday. The bodies of Betty Parente and the two daughters were found on a king-size bed in the hotel room, while William Parente's body was found in the bathroom, police said. Evidence indicates Betty Parente and Catherine Parente were killed sometime on Sunday, with Stephanie Parente's death occurring later the same day. Police spokesman Cpl. Michael Hill said the older daughter might have been killed after she returned to the room and found her mother and sister dead. Police had no information regarding how the deaths took place or what other family members were doing at the time. There was no evidence they were restrained, Johnson said. In addition, an autopsy showed no evidence they were drugged, Hill said, although conclusive toxicology test results are weeks away. Authorities are still investigating the timeline and details, Johnson said. Police have not specified the murder weapon, although several objects in the room are being investigated, he said. No note or communication was found with the bodies. Hill said police believe the family was together Sunday morning for breakfast, and they know what time the card key was last used to unlock the room. Loyola College spokeswoman Courtney Jolley said Stephanie Parente was a sophomore majoring in speech-language pathology with a natural-sciences minor. She was a former member of the women's crew team and coxswain for the men's crew, Jolley said. She also volunteered through the college's Center for Community Service and Justice. She had planned to study in Newcastle, England, next year, Jolley said. Johnson urged people having emotional and mental health difficulties to reach out for help. ""There's a safety net in place,"" he said.","Police say William Parente killed wife, two daughters in hotel room .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel doesn't like losing -- and Formula One's youngest ever triple world champion showed he means business after wrapping up pole position at Sepang Saturday. The Red Bull driver, who started at the front of the grid at Melbourne last weekend, was beaten into third after Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso took the top two spots. Vettel's frustration at failing to make the most of his advantage was palpable, but ahead of Sunday's second race of the season in Malaysia, he demonstrated once again why he's the man to beat. The Circuit: CNN's look at the Malaysian Grand Prix . With the rain causing chaos, the German recorded recorded a fastest time of one minute 49.674 seconds to pip Ferrari's Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso, who will start second and third on the grid. ""I think if you start in the front you always want to finish there,"" Vettel told the post-qualifying press conference. ""We confirmed more or less what we saw in Melbourne. I was very happy with the balance of the car once again. ""I think also considering where we were last year here, a big step forward. But these days racing is a little bit different. ""Hopefully we'll find the right amount of percentage less than 100% to start he race tomorrow. ""Managing the tires will be crucial and then we go from there. We know the pace is there so hopefully we get to the checkered flag in the same position."" While Vettel was left content with his performance, last weekend's race winner Raikkonen suffered a disappointing day after being handed a three-place penalty. The Finn had qualified in seventh before stewards adjudged him to have impended the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg. ""It's a shame to lose the three places but it is what it is,"" he told Lotus' official website. ""You never know what will happen in the race -- especially here -- so we'll do our best and let's hope we have the speed to get on the podium."" Raikkonen's absence from the top end of the grid is a bonus for Ferrari, with Massa in particular looking to take advantage after out-qualifying Alonso for the fourth race in succession. Read Ferrari revved up for F1 title fight . ""I think whenever you feel comfortable you can do a good lap and you can use the car to the maximum, it's possible,"" he told reporters. ""It was really clear that I was not comfortable last year and the year before, so many things around the car, bad luck, around myself as well, so there were so many things that were not working in the proper direction. ""But now they are and I know how quick I can be, I've showed that many times in the past. ""If everything works well, we can be competitive; it's pretty sure about that. I believe in myself and I think it can be really important for the team, for Fernando as well, for everybody. ""We need a stronger team, a strong position and fighting for the best position in every race so I'm happy, that's a good direction."" Two-time world champion Alonso won at Sepang last season and will be hoping for a repeat performance this time around -- despite being outshone by teammate Massa . ""I think I've been racing 27 years now in motor racing - I'm getting old - so it's not the first time that we have very close competition,"" he told the press conference. ""It was very close the last three years as well, but I know that for you it was not that close in terms of results because I think Felipe had some bad luck, some incidents sometimes, some mechanical problems other times. ""But the last three years was much closer than I think that it looked in the points at the end. ""So this year it is again very close, no big difference, maybe a little bit closer and for sure the last two races we are behind on the grid but so far on Saturday there are no points so we need to keep working for Sunday. ""It's the best news for the team, because we need to have a competition between the two drivers in the team. ""We need to share information between the drivers in the team and now I think all the data that we have from free practice, from qualifying for everything is very useful to compare and to analyze to make ourselves better. ""So this is only good news for the team and we will push each other to our own limits and this is good news for the team. After claiming a fifth place finish in last weekend's season-opener, Lewis Hamilton is aiming for better in his Mercedes. The 2008 world champion will start fourth on the grid and is targeting a podium finish. ""The car was not too bad in the dry but the balance could have been a lot better, then it was pretty tricky conditions in the wet during Q3,"" he told the team's official website. ""We did our lap with older tires than the guys in front, which was a bit unfortunate, but our pace was good overall so I can't complain. ""It's the second race on the second row for me and there are lots of positives to take out of the weekend so far. ""Our long run pace looked pretty good compared to the other teams so I'm hoping for dry conditions tomorrow.""","Sebastian Vettel on pole position for Malaysian Grand Prix .

"New York (CNN) -- The suspect wanted in connection with the hit-and-run crash that killed a Brooklyn couple and their unborn child this week turned himself in to authorities in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, New York police said. Julio Acevedo, 44, was arrested after a friend helped facilitate his surrender in the crowded parking lot of a mini mart in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne of the New York Police Department. The friend, Derrick Hamilton, traveled with detectives and a deputy U.S. marshal to the site. Acevedo was given a description of unmarked police cars to look for when surrendering, Browne said. Police said Acevedo was cooperative and was taken to a Pennsylvania State Police barracks to await extradition proceedings. He was arrested at 5:10 p.m. Video of the surrender, shot by CNN affiliates WFMZ and WABC and posted on their websites, showed Acevedo in a light blue hooded sweatshirt, his hands uncuffed, being helped out of a gray sedan and put into a silver SUV. Hamilton helped arrange for Acevedo to speak to reporters by phone Tuesday. During that call, Acevedo said he was trying to get away from someone shooting at him when he crashed, according to WABC. Police say Acevedo was going about 60 miles per hour early Sunday when the BMW he was driving crashed into the side of a livery cab carrying Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21. Raizy Glauber was pregnant; she and her husband were going to the hospital because she wasn't feeling well, said her cousin, Sarah Gluck. The couple's baby boy was delivered by cesarean section from his dead mother's womb but died the next day, police said. The driver of the cab survived. The front of the BMW was smashed but the black Toyota Camry cab was left a mangled wreck. The driver's side was crushed, the front wheel was hanging off, and pieces of metal were bent in every direction. Police say Acevedo fled the scene on foot. It wasn't immediately clear how police identified him as the suspect. Authorities arrested the BMW's registered owner Monday on insurance fraud charges, Browne said. ""He was a coward,"" Isaac Abraham, a community leader and neighbor of the couple, told WABC after Acevedo's arrest. ""He left the scene."" The deaths brought heartache to the Glaubers' Hasidic community in Brooklyn, many of whom mourned the couple's deaths at a funeral service on Sunday. ""A loss like that cannot be replaced by having him arrested or by surrendering or no matter what charges will be brought against him once he finally faces up to the justice system,"" Abraham said. Cab driver Pedro NuÃ±ez Delacruz told WABC he didn't find out what happened to the Glaubers until he got into the ambulance. ""I feel very sorry for that beautiful family,"" he said.","Julio Acevedo surrendered in Pennsylvania at a mini mart .

"Niger Delta, Nigeria (CNN) -- The young man, his body glistening with black oil and sweat, poured more oil onto the fire. The flames roared, heating two barrels of oil to explosive temperatures. He escaped to a safer distance, a slight smile breaking his grim face ­-- he had survived. ""This job is very dangerous,"" he explains, asking to remain anonymous. ""The smoke, the heat ­-- I cannot count the number of people who have died in explosions because they cannot escape the flames."" He is risking his life trying to refine diesel from oil in the swamps of Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta. The contraption looks like a crude school science project. The aim is to boil two barrels of oil to evaporate the diesel which then passes down a rusted pipe, cooled by water, and drips slowly out into a container at the other end. Heating oil to such temperatures with such basic equipment is dangerous. Having the distilled diesel only a few meters from a naked flame can be lethal. The surrounding trees and earth are blackened from the flames and explosions. The four young men working the illegal refineries stand a respectable distance from the flames until it is their turn to pour more oil on the fire. Nigeria is the fifth-largest oil exporter to the U.S. but little money from the country's oil industry has been invested in its main oil-producing region -- the Niger Delta. Taken out over the region in a Shell helicopter, the illegal oil-refining sites look like small pockets of hell -­ scorched earth with great flames leaping up from small dark craters. From the air, Shell facilities that have been attacked and the subsequent oil spills can be seen. The oil companies, the government and the communities below are locked in a battle of blame over who is responsible for the cycle of violence. Meanwhile, the region is being plundered. There is little development and the majority of people live on less that $2 a day, despite the region's vast oil wealth. And at the heart of the problem is corruption --­ billions of dollars worth of oil are being stolen in a massive illegal business known as ""oil bunkering."" ""I would put the figure at about 100,000 barrels a day,"" explains Mutiu Sunmonu, the Managing Director of Shell. ""Some of it is stolen in tankers."" Sold abroad for a price of $60 a barrel, 100,000 barrels would be worth more than $2 billion a year. On Monday, the crude oil futures market surged past $80 a barrel to its highest levels in three months. No-one has been prosecuted but reports accuse local politicians and the military of heavy involvement. The young men at the illegal refineries however collect their oil in dugout canoes, not tankers. They are not the major players. And they say they are tired of receiving all the blame and none of the money from Nigeria's oil industry. But when I asked if he saw a way out he simply shook his head. Then he turned and ran to put more oil on the fire before it died out.","Illegal refineries distill diesel from crude oil by heating over naked flames .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Global warming and the state of the planet aren't exactly laughing matters, but for comedian Abie Philbin Bowman, the dire environmental outlook has at least one bright side. Abie Philbin Bowman sees the funny side of global warming at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

If the New Economics Foundation's current predictions are correct and we have only 100 months to come up with a solution to reverse the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, then Bowman won't even reach 40 before he can begin to exalt the 'benefits' of being a Gen-Yer. In the meantime, he's using climate change and terrorism as material for his latest comedy offering at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland, ""Eco-Friendly Jihad."" Bowman told CNN it's the over reaction to terrorism and comparative under reaction to global warming that has his central character -- a Bangladeshi environmentalist -- on a mission to join Al Qaeda in an effort to reduce global carbon emissions. ""The longer we do nothing, the more radical the action we will ultimately have to take. The most extreme strategy would be to start killing the world's worst polluters -- Westerners -- preferably in a way which discourages others from flying,"" he said. And so begins the eco-friendly jihad. Having grown up in a country plagued by domestic terrorism for three decades, the Irish comic insists he is staunchly anti-terrorism, but he told CNN he was ready to go where no one else will. ""It's much more fun to tell jokes about religious nuts and neo-cons, but the whole point of any political joke is to reveal an 'inconvenient truth.' ""Climate change is the biggest crisis in the history of the world and for a political humorist it's not inherently funny, but it's something that no one wants to talk about."" Susan Mansfield said as much in her review of the show for ""The Scotsman"":  ""Bowman has a gift for winning an audience over, and coaxing original, friendly humour from subjects that are neither friendly nor funny."" She adds: ""he's done his homework, and there are plenty of facts here, but the underlying message is a bleak one: as long as we continue being middle-class consumers, it ain't looking good for the human race."" On debut in 2006, Bowman took the Edinburgh Fringe Festival by storm with ""Jesus: The Guantanamo Years"", which he then toured for 18 months. Having had the success that comes with five-star reviews and a run of sold out performances, he seems a little underwhelmed by the response to ""Eco-Friendly Jihad."" Rather than pan the show as extremist, one reviewer thought he didn't go far enough: ""he should hold back less and plunge the knife in further. Not only does Bowman get better laughs when he's being more controversial, he also makes you think more."" But Bowman counters saying that he wouldn't go as far as to actually advocate people join Al Qaeda to save the planet. After all, this is comedy. ""I didn't personally design climate change and I probably can't solve it in an hour,"" he jokes. So what then does he want his audience to walk away thinking? ""I guess I want people to start out by being honest. To say 'okay, we are destroying the planet and we are either okay or not okay with that'. People will have to make a decision as to whether or not to then change their behavior."" Bowman says until now he's adopted the 'every little bit counts' approach to climate change abatement, but concedes it's not enough. ""Buy some locally-produced potatoes, a few energy-saving light bulbs, put them all in a re-usable plastic bag and don't think twice about your weekend break in Paris."" On a serious note, he adds: ""People are causing the ultimate destruction of the environment and essentially our fate is in our hands."" And that's no laughing matter.","Comedian Abie Philbin Bowman tackles global warming in his new show .

"Washington (CNN) -- Last November, Hispanic voters planted the seeds for serious immigration reform when they backed President Barack Obama by a record margin. This April, we'll see if those seeds can grow in Capitol Hill's toxic partisan soil. Congress returns from spring break Monday, and immigration reform tops the agenda. The Senate's bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" is preparing to release its long-awaited plan for resolving the status of 11 million undocumented men, women, and children now living in America's shadows. Can a unique confluence of factors -- a Democratic president trying to build his legacy, a Republican Party grappling with new demographic realities -- overcome the usual strong bias for inaction in a sharply divided Congress? The answer remains unclear. ""What we have now is not a 21st century legal immigration system,"" GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a key conservative at the heart of the talks, said back in January. ""We have an obligation and the need to address the reality of the situation that we face."" Who's in the Gang of Eight? The list includes Rubio; Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona; Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona; Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey; Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois; Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado; and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York. Farm worker dispute holding up immigration bill . Details of the Senate plan . A source familiar with negotiations recently told CNN that the eight senators have tentatively reached agreement on some of the thorniest issues, including the establishment of a path to citizenship and the creation of a system to assess the state of border security. The Senate proposal could come ""in the next couple of weeks,"" Graham said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" But McCain told reporters later Sunday morning that he still thinks ""it's very likely"" and ""very possible"" to have it done by the end of the week. ""I'm guardedly optimistic. I can't guarantee it. But we have literally almost all of the issues resolved,"" he said. Specifically, the senators have agreed to a 13-year path to citizenship, the source said. It would take 10 years for undocumented workers to get a green card, and then another three years to gain citizenship. Along the way, undocumented workers would have to pay a fine and back taxes, and pass a background check. The size of the fine remains unclear. No undocumented worker would be eligible for citizenship until the border is considered secure. To measure border security, a commission would be created with the task of establishing and assessing a set of quantifiable criteria. The commission would be made up of officials named by state and federal leaders. Sides reach broad agreement on immigrant guest workers . Disagreement over agricultural workers . A sharp disagreement over the future treatment of undocumented workers on America's farms, however, is currently holding up progress on the bill. The two key sticking points are wages and the number of visas to be granted to undocumented farm workers, two other sources close to the talks confirmed Friday. Four senators -- Rubio, Bennet, Utah Republican Orrin Hatch, and California Democrat Dianne Feinstein -- are trying to deal with the matter. ""It's the one major unresolved issue,"" one of the sources told CNN. The sources were unable to provide specifics in terms of the number of visas or wage levels under consideration. But generally speaking, agricultural businesses have an interest in more visas and lower wages. Labor leaders, in contrast, typically support fewer visas and higher wages. Saying there are a ""few little kerfuffles"" to work out in the drafting of the legislation -- referring to the disagreement over agricultural workers -- Schumer told CNN on Sunday the senators have written ""most of the bill"" and feel hopeful that they can announce a full agreement at the end of the week. ""We've solved most of the issues, there are a few more to go, there are a few more today and tomorrow. I'm very optimistic we'll be able to solve those last few problems,"" he said, declining to get into specifics. Language like 'illegal immigrant' seen as a challenge . Agreement on nonagricultural workers . Business and labor leaders appear to have settled on a deal establishing a new immigrant guest worker program for nonagricultural workers. The compromise, according to another source, is the creation of a new ""W"" visa for lesser-skilled workers not working in agriculture. Those workers would be allowed to enter the country based on labor market shortages, and could enter with the possibility of eventually applying for citizenship. The W visa would affect housekeepers, landscapers, retail workers and some construction workers, the source noted. The agreement does not address visas for high-skilled workers or family members. According to the AFL-CIO's understanding of the agreement, the visa program would launch in April 2015. The number of visas issued would never go below 20,000 per year and could rise as high as 200,000 annually, depending on employment levels. One third of the visas would be reserved for businesses that employ fewer than 25 people, while no more than 15,000 visas per year would go to construction workers, the AFL-CIO said. A new government department, the Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research, would determine specific industries with labor shortages and make recommendations to Congress. The agency would also play a role in setting an annual cap for W visas. The bureau would fall under the existing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and its director would be appointed by the president and confirmed by Congress. ""The beauty of this program is that it rises and falls with the economy,"" the AFL-CIO's Ana Avendano recently told CNN. ""When the economy is booming, there will be more visas available for foreign workers. When it's not, there won't be, and that's something we've never seen in the United States before."" Randy Johnson, senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, released a statement declaring the proposed new visa program ""a sound and workable program for the business community."" Immigration tops agenda as senators tour border . Senate resistance . The Gang of Eight may be ideologically diverse, but that doesn't mean there won't be significant resistance to the plan once it's released -- especially among wary conservatives. GOP base voters remain vehemently opposed to any plan which could be construed as amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, remain concerned that conservatives will never agree the country's southern border is secure, and will try to use that issue to continually deny citizenship to undocumented residents. In the Senate, Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions and others have repeatedly expressed the fear that Democratic leaders will try to ram the Gang of Eight's plan through before other members have a chance to properly consider the bill. Top Democrats ""want Congress to pass a far-reaching bill before the American people know what's in it,"" Sessions said in a statement released April 2. ""Now that the special interests have what they want, the deal has been made: Force it through and set the public interest aside."" Rubio has also said he's worried the legislation may be rushed through Congress -- a concern some observers say reflects political necessities as the Florida freshman balances his role in immigration reform with possible presidential ambitions. Responding to GOP pressure to release details of the secretive Gang of Eight deliberations, Rubio promised Friday to brief his fellow Republican senators on Tuesday. ""This proposal will be a starting point,"" Rubio wrote to four GOP colleagues. ""I expect you will have ample opportunity to review, comment, and amend as you see fit."" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who will oversee the committee-level markup of the bill once it's released, has repeatedly dismissed Sessions' and Rubio's concerns. The Judiciary Committee ""has already held several widely-attended hearings to examine the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform,"" Leahy said in an April 2 statement. ""If we do not act quickly and decisively we will lose the opportunity we now have."" Leahy said he hopes for a final Senate vote by this summer. Immigration debate: High-stakes political poker . A House alternative . While most eyes are focused on the Senate, a bipartisan group of House members is working on its own version of immigration reform. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters last month that the members are ""essentially in agreement"" on a plan to deal with the issue. The House members involved in the talks are Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Florida; Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas; Rep. John Carter, R-Texas; Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho; Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-California; Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois; Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California; and Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Kentucky. The members of the House group have been reluctant to talk publicly about their bipartisan negotiations. Some of them have been working on the issue since Congress failed to get a deal done in 2007. However, two members of the House ""Gang of Eight"" sounded confident Sunday that their upcoming proposal will ultimately mesh well with the Senate's proposal, despite expected battles over the issue in both chambers in the months ahead. ""I am very, very optimistic that the House of Representatives is going to have a plan that is going to be able to go to a conference with the Senate in which we're going to be able to resolve differences,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" He was joined by his Republican colleague Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida. Asked if the House version would have a similar border security prerequisite, the two House members seemed less certain. ""You can't have a bill without border security. You just can't,"" Diaz-Balart said. Pressed further on whether that provision would be a priority, Gutierrez said, ""I think we can do this simultaneously."" ""I think first thing we're going to do is, we're going to put people in a safe place. That is 11 million people, you can give them a work permit, Social Security card, driver's license,"" he added. ""And then the second part is the path to the green card, that permanent residency that leads to citizenship."" House members optimistic about immigration overhaul .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Eight years ago, Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna became global pin-ups for the resurgence in Mexican filmmaking after their memorable breakthrough in coming-of-age road movie ""Y tu Mama Tambien."" ""Rudo y Cursi"" reunites Luna and Bernal, who became pin-ups for the resurgence in Mexican filmmaking with ""Y tu Mama Tambien"" in 2001. Today, Luna and Bernal's on-screen chemistry has once again grabbed the public's attention, this time in Mexico, where their latest film ""Rudo y Cursi"" made box-office history. It became the fourth highest-grossing film in the country's history when it was released at the end of 2008. ""Rudo y Cursi,"" approximately translated as Tough and Corny, tells the story of two rural banana farmers who, after being 'spotted' by a crooked talent scout, gain instant celebrity in the Mexican soccer league playing for opposing teams. But, mesmerized by women and fast cars and unable to defy their demons, they look on powerless as the dream disintegrates in front of them almost as suddenly as it arrived. The movie touches on fame, poverty and corruption, but for its makers, it is ultimately a tale of brotherhood. It was written written and directed by Carlos Cuaron, and is the first release from groundbreaking new production venture Cha Cha Cha films. Cha Cha Cha was established by Mexico's three leading directors who are also renowned internationally -- Carlos' brother Alfonso Cuaron (""Children of Men""), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Babel"") and Guillermo del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth""). All three serve as producers on the film.  In pictures: Bernal and Garcia in ""Rudo y Cursi"" » . ""Originally I wanted to make a fake documentary about a footballer from a humble background who made it big and then disappeared mysteriously,"" Carlos Cuaron told CNN. ""But I told this idea to Gael [Garcia Bernal] and Diego [Luna], and they both said they wanted to play the part. I had one part and two actors. So I made up another brother and forgot about the fake documentary."" Cuaron also cast Bernal and Luna -- best friends since childhood in Mexico City who were so keen to do the film the signed up before they saw a script -- against type and against their wishes. Both had originally wanted to play the opposite character: Bernal the abrasive Rudo, and Luna the romantic Cursi. They were eventually dissuaded by Cuaron who said: ""I don't want to make Y Tu Mama Tambien 2."" The idea behind Cha Cha Cha films was conceived by Cuaron senior, del Toro and Innaritu when the trio -- a kind of all-stars of Mexican cinema -- found themselves with a surprise 16 nominations and 4 awards at the 2007 Oscars. The idea came out of a desire to pool their their rising bargaining power and maximize their clout in Hollywood -- and, of course, out of friendship. The company was ""born out of friendship and sibling sympathies,"" del Toro told CNN. When Carlos was originally writing the script, his bother, Alfonso told him thought it was perfect for Cha Cha Cha. The venture formalizes a working relationship del Toro, Innaritu and Alfonso Cuaron have had for years, but they freely admit they spend little time together. Rather it is a case of exchanging ideas and honing each other's writing over the phone and via email from all over the globe. Del Toro, for example, is currently in New Zealand directing Peter Jackson's follow-up to his wildly successful ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Hobbit."" It would appear that the Mexican trio have created an ideal creative environment for themselves, Cha Cha Cha has been criticized for forgetting their Mexican heritage in the rush to embrace Hollywood. It is not a criticism they take lightly. Watch Cuaron, Bernal and Garcia talking about ""Rudo y Cursi"" ""I don't care about Mexican films, about indie films, about Hollywood films,"" says Alfonso. ""Just good or bad movies. ""Yes, it's great that we have a common background as Mexican creators, but once you are a creator you have a common language with creators from all around the world."" For del Toro, the company will extend the influence of Mexican cinema not diminish it: ""We want to give Mexican cinema, if you want to call it that, the credentials and right to exist in world cinema. ""People don't think twice when [Italian filmmaker] Bernardo Bertolucci is doing a movie about China called 'The Last Emperor.' ""But in your mind, Latin American filmmakers are only doing Latin American films. We're trying to show that it's important to have roots, but not borders."" The bittersweet drama has played to big laughs all over Mexico and the U.S., but for its makers, it is not simply a comedy. ""People talk about this film as if it's a comedy but I question that,"" says Alfonso. ""The elements are very dramatic and actually very tragic, and the ending has a very bittersweet tone."" According to del Toro, the movie ""says there's a way to be comfortable with failure, and finding you're emotionally more satisfied in failing."" Failure though, is not an issue overly burdening Cha Cha Cha's ""three amigos,"" -- their second film, ""Biutiful,"" set in Barcelona, directed by Inarritu and starring Javier Bardem is currently being edited in Spain. Alfonso told CNN his next movie would be shot in France and Scotland, and would be in French and English, though that too ""will be a Cha Cha Cha film."" Carlos Cuaron is the only one who is unhappy, despite the unprecedented success of his directorial debut. ""For me it's difficult,"" he says. ""Whenever I see the movie, I only see the flaws. Nobody else sees them."" ""Not even your mother?"" asks Bernal. ""No, not my mother,"" says the director. ""She thinks I'm a genius.""","Mexican superstars Gael Garcia Bernal, Diego Luna star together .

"(CNN) -- Suffice it to say that of all possible storylines to emerge, heading into the election of a new pope, sensational charges of a shadowy ""gay lobby"" (possibly linked to blackmail), whose occult influence may have been behind the resignation of Benedict XVI, would be right at the bottom of the Vatican's wish list. Proof of the Vatican's irritation came with a blistering statement Saturday complaining of ""unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories,"" even suggesting the media is trying to influence the papal election. Two basic questions have to be asked about all this. First, is there really a secret dossier about a network of people inside the Vatican who are linked by their sexual orientation, as Italian newspaper reports have alleged? Second, is this really why Benedict XVI quit? The best answers, respectively, are ""maybe"" and ""probably not."" It's a matter of record that at the peak of last year's massive Vatican leaks crisis, Benedict XVI created a commission of three cardinals to investigate the leaks. They submitted an eyes-only report to the pope in mid-December, which has not been made public. It's impossible to confirm whether that report looked into the possibility that people protecting secrets about their sex lives were involved with the leaks, but frankly, it would be surprising if it didn't. There are certainly compelling reasons to consider the hypothesis. In 2007, a Vatican official was caught by an Italian TV network on hidden camera arranging a date through a gay-oriented chat room, and then taking the young man back to his Vatican apartment. In 2010, a papal ceremonial officer was caught on a wiretap arranging liaisons through a Nigerian member of a Vatican choir. Both episodes played out in full public view, and gave the Vatican a black eye. In that context, it would be a little odd if the cardinals didn't at least consider the possibility that insiders leading a double life might be vulnerable to pressure to betray the pope's confidence. That would apply not just to sex, but also potential conflicts of other sorts too, such as financial interests. Vatican officials have said Benedict may authorize giving the report to the 116 cardinals who will elect his successor, so they can factor it into their deliberations. The most immediate fallout is that the affair is likely to strengthen the conviction among many cardinals that the next pope has to lead a serious house-cleaning inside the Vatican's bureaucracy. It seems a stretch, however, to suggest this is the real reason Benedict is leaving. For the most part, one should probably take the pope at his word, that old age and fatigue are the motives for his decision. That said, it's hard not to suspect that the meltdowns and controversies that have dogged Benedict XVI for the last eight years are in the background of why he's so tired. In 2009, at the height of another frenzy surrounding the lifting of the excommunication of a Holocaust-denying traditionalist bishop, Benedict dispatched a plaintive letter to the bishops of the world, voicing hurt for the way he'd been attacked and apologizing for the Vatican's mishandling of the situation. Even if Benedict didn't resign because of any specific crisis, including this latest one, such anguish must have taken its toll. Benedict is a teaching pope, a man who prefers the life of the mind to the nuts and bolts of government, yet an enormous share of his time and energy has been consumed trying to put out internal fires. It's hard to know why Benedict XVI is stepping off the stage, but I doubt it is because of a ""gay lobby."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John L. Allen Jr.","Benedict XVI not stepping down under pressure from 'gay lobby,' Allen says .
Allen: Benedict is a man who prefers the life of the mind to the nuts and bolts of government .
However, he says, much of the pope's time has been spent putting out fires ."
"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The defense in the murder trial of a Philadelphia doctor accused of performing illegal late-term abortions rested Wednesday without calling any witnesses. Closing arguments in the trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell are scheduled for Monday, and a jury could begin deliberations Tuesday. Gosnell, 72, is charged with four first-degree murder counts for the deaths of four babies. Authorities allege that some of the infants were born viable and alive during the sixth, seventh and eighth months of pregnancy, but were killed with scissors that were used to cut their spinal cords. Judge tosses 3 murder charges against abortion doctor . In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. Defense attorney Jack McMahon has maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already deceased as a result of Gosnell previously administering the drug digoxin, which can cause abortion. McMahon cross-examined the state's witnesses Wednesday, but did not call any witnesses for the defense. Gosnell also is charged with third-degree murder in the death of a 41-year-old Virginia woman, Karnamaya Mongar, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. Gosnell, who operated the Women's Medical Society clinic in West Philadelphia, has pleaded not guilty. On Tuesday, Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart threw out three of the original seven first-degree murder charges against Gosnell as well as five abuse of corpse charges in connection with the storage of the feet of aborted fetuses. Minehart also dismissed one count of infanticide, the intentional killing of an infant. Doctor performed illegal late-term abortions, ex-employee testifies . A grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received reports about Gosnell's practices for two decades but had taken no action, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said. When authorities searched Gosnell's office, they found bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses scattered throughout the building. Jars containing the severed feet of babies lined a shelf. Furniture and equipment was bloodstained, dusty and broken. The city's chief medical examiner, Sam Gulino, told jurors this month that as part of the investigation into the charges against Gosnell, he had to examine the remains of 47 aborted fetuses that were stored in water jugs, pet food containers and a freezer inside the abortion clinic. Victim's daughter offers emotional testimony . Minehart also dismissed six of the nine counts of theft by deception against Gosnell co-defendant Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who worked as a doctor at the Women's Medical Society. O'Neill, who did not have a medical license, is not charged with performing abortions but with participating in the operation of a ""corrupt organization."" Meanwhile, a gag order remains in place preventing attorneys or the jury from speaking to the media.

"(CNN) -- Seven and a half years after allegedly fatally shooting his wife in the back and head, a now 42-year-old man is in custody -- in Italy, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. Italian authorities arrested Miguel Torres on Friday at his home in the northern city of Bologna, the U.S. Marshals Service announced. His capture came after the U.S. Marshals Service, working with Italian law enforcement and U.S. Diplomatic Security Service, learned that he was living in Italy under the alias Rene Rondon. After she moved out of his home, Torres' wife sought and got a restraining order against him in September 2005, according to the Marshals Service. Later that month, Torres allegedly hid in the backseat of his wife's car -- getting in with a spare key he had -- waiting for her to get out of work in Reading, Pennsylvania. He got out after she spotted him and she ran, with Torres allegedly first shooting her in the back before walking up to her and shooting her in the head, the U.S. Marshals Service said. According to the Berks County Sheriff, Torres -- who was a Reading resident at the time of the incident -- is charged with murder. In June 2011, the U.S. Marshals Service added Torres to its list of 15 Most Wanted individuals. ""This final act of aggression was in keeping with his history of violence and abuse and we will do our best to swiftly bring him to justice,"" Geoffrey Shank, then the federal agency's acting assistant director of investigative operations, said at the time.","Authorities allege Miguel Torres ambushed his wife in 2005, then killed her .

"(CNN) -- Digital cameras are now as common and affordable to the average family as the Polaroid of the '60s. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. Best thing about 'em? You don't even have to take your film in to the corner drugstore to get developed -- because digital cameras don't rely on film to make their pictures ""stick."" Thanks to technology, the entire process, from clicking the shutter to printing the pictures, is now entirely within the power of the consumer. Maybe you've taken a picture that's just not as perfect as you'd like it to be. Instead of being at the mercy of a darkroom-shackled photo lackey to improve upon it, you've got more tools than ever to take it upon yourself to edit, store, organize, and share your images with the world. Here's a roundup of 10 free, and mostly free, online tools for the budding digital photographer: . 1. Picnik -- Summed up from the site: ""Picnik makes your photos fabulous with easy to use yet powerful editing tools. Tweak to your heart's content, then get creative with oodles of effects, fonts, shapes, and frames."" If you already use Flickr for your photos (here's what I do with mine), you're only a click away from taking a Picnik. That's how I discovered it, and it's worked fairly well for me to this point. 2. Splashup-- Splashup ""is a powerful editing tool and photo manager. With all the features professionals use and novices want, it's easy to use, works in real-time, and allows you to edit many images at once."" You'd wonder how something this extensive could be free - and it all runs within the browser. 3. FotoFlexer -- FotoFlexer bills itself as ""the world's most advanced online image editor."" With it, you can edit photos from Photobucket, MySpace, Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, and ""more places."" I'm not quite sure what ""more places"" means, but last I checked, this does not include a phone booth. 4. Pixlr -- ""Pixlr is a free online photo editor; jump in and start: edit, adjust, filter. It's just what you imagine!"" Alexa says it's the ""fastest growing photo editor online."" If these resources are starting to look similar to your eye, remember you don't have to use all of them - just pick the one that works best for your needs. 5. flauntR-- flauntR is a suite that includes the ability to edit images, add effects, add text, and print the results on everything from mugs to posters. You might be overwhelmed with the options here, but... isn't that better than being underwhelmed? 6. Photoshop Express-- Adobe's Photoshop was really the first image editor of its kind to herald in the age of digital photography, though it was designed for professionals and its endless options could be daunting (and bank- breakingly expensive) for the layman. Now, Photoshop.com is on the Web to help that very same layman -- for free or plus levels of membership -- edit, store, and share his photos. Lots of helpful tutorials promise to guide the casual user through editing pickles. 7. PiZap-- PiZap's tagline is ""fun with photos made easy.""

"(EW.com) -- If this weekend's box office is any indication, the couch jumping stigma that has plagued Tom Cruise's career for the better part of the last decade may finally be thing of the past. Cruise's latest, the $120 million sci-fi adventure Oblivion, opened to a solid $38.2 million this weekend. That's a terrific start for the chiseled star, who has struggled recently at the box office with under-performers like Jack Reacher, Rock of Ages, Valkyrie, and Knight and Day. In fact, only four Cruise vehicles have ever opened higher â€” and three of them are Mission Impossible movies. (The other is War of the Worlds). Oblivion actually marks the first number one opening for Cruise in seven years, though it should be noted that Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol opened in limited release and climbed to number one upon its wide expansion. Cruise isn't the only star in Oblivion â€” it also features Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough, and Olga Kurlyenko â€” but it was marketed almost exclusively on his appeal. According to distributor Universal, audiences, which were 57 percent male and 74 percent 25 or older, listed Tom Cruise as their primary reason for seeing the film, followed by the sci-fi genre and Morgan Freeman. Those same audiences weren't in love with what they saw, though, as Oblivion was issued a lackluster ""B-"" CinemaScore grade. EW: 'Oblivion' movie review . Domestically, Oblivion opened in 3,783 theaters and earned a fantastic $10,085 location average. IMAX screens accounted for $5.5 million of Oblivion's weekend gross. Internationally, the film had a successful weekend, as well. After its $61.1 million opening from 52 territories, Oblivion took in another $33.6 million from 60 territories this time around. The film has grossed $112 million so far (for a $150.2 million worldwide total), and it has high-profile openings in Japan and China still to come. In second, the Jackie Robinson drama 42 fell only 34 percent to $18 million for a $54.1 million total after ten days. Warner Bros.' $40 million baseball pic, which earned an ""A+"" CinemaScore grade, didn't hold quite as well as The Help, another ""A+"" racially charged drama, which dipped 23 percent in its second weekend. Thus, while 42 still seems likely to hit the $100 million mark, it doesn't seem destined for a gross in the same range as The Help's $169 million total. Still, 42 is a big winner for Warner Bros., which was in dire need of a box office hit. EW: 'The Place Beyond the Pines' review . The Croods spent the weekend in third place, dropping 28 percent to $9.5 million. After five weeks, the $135 million animation has grossed $154.9 million, a great start in the five-year distribution deal between DreamWorks Animation and Fox. In fourth, Scary Movie 5 didn't hold nearly as well. The $20 million spoof from Weinstein's Dimension fell 56 percent to $6.3 million, giving it a weak $22.9 million total after ten days. At the same point in its run, Scary Movie 4 had earned $67.5 million. G.I. Joe: Retaliation rounded out the Top 5 with $5.8 million, marking a 48 percent drop from its prior frame. Paramount's $130 million film has now earned $111.2 million domestically, a substantially lower gross than its predecessor, but it's been making up ground overseas, where the film has earned $211.7 million. Retaliation opened in China this week, where it took in $33 million during its first seven days. Worldwide, Retaliation has earned $322.9 million and should pass the $400 million mark with ease. 1. Oblivion -- $38.2 million . 2. 42 -- $18 million . 3. The Croods -- $9.5 million . 4. Scary Movie 5 -- $6.3 million . 5. G.I. Joe: Retaliation -- $5.8 million . The Place Beyond the Pines just missed the Top 5 after expanding from 514 theaters into 1,542 theaters. Pines grossed $4.8 million, yielding a mediocre $3,078 per theater average, which doesn't merit further expansion. The Focus Features release cost $15 million and has earned $11.4 million total. Two other quick highlights: Sony's $13 million Halle Berry thriller The Call passed the $50 million mark this weekend. It's been a nice mid-level hit for distributor TriStar. Olympus Has Fallen has also been doing terrific business for its distributor, FilmDistrict. After five weekends, the White House thriller has quietly earned $88.8 million.

"(EW.com) -- Bazinga: CBS has overthrown Fox to win the 2012-13 broadcast season among the coveted adults 18-49 demographic. With only two nights left in the season, CBS claimed victory Tuesday given its insurmountable lead. The win snaps Fox's unprecedented eight-year winning streak. CBS gets cocky: 'We are the center of the universe' Among total viewers, CBS has led the broadcast field for years, ranking No. 1 during 10 of the past 11 seasons. But this is the first time CBS has won in the 18-49 demo in 21 years. CBS would even win the season if you excluded the network's high-flying Super Bowl coverage. The network claims nine of the top 15 scripted primetime programs, including ""Big Bang Theory,"" ""NCIS"" and ""Person of Interest."" During a press breakfast for reporters last week, CBS Corp. CEO Les Moonves relished the current standings. Yet CBS only deserves partial credit for its ranking. The network maintained roughly the same ratings as last year â€” which is certainly no easy task in an era of increasing DVR use, streaming and competition from cable networks. But it was Fox declining 22 percent due to softening ""American Idol"" popularity and other factors that gave CBS the trophy. Fox hopes to surge back next season with its new schedule, including the promising J.J. Abrams-produced action-drama ""Almost Human,"" and the use of short-order limited series, including a rebooted ""24."" The ""Idol"" judges panel will be firmed up over the next couple months, and last night Fox announced an experienced new judges panel for ""The X Factor."" Fox unveils fall schedule . The rest: NBC slipped slightly this season. But if you were to remove the Super Bowl from its average last year, NBC would have actually been up thanks to ""The Voice"" boosting its fall (and despite a rather spectacular midseason ratings crash). ABC also fell, and this fall rolls out a whooping eight new shows. See the original story on EW.com.

"Long Beach, California (CNN) -- ""The great question that has never been answered and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul, is, 'What does a woman want?' "" This was Sigmund Freud's response in 1925 to a female protégé, Marie Bonaparte, who sought his guidance. Bonaparte, then in her early 40s, suffered in her own words, from ""frigidity."" His question is alive today: Last week, a Food and Drug Administration panel reviewed the efficacy  and safety of a new drug to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder -- lack of sexual desire. (The panel did not recommend approval.) I'll come back to this in a minute. Why does Freud's question persist? Well, one reason may have to do with who is asking the question, when, and why. In the early decades of the 20th century, for example, a Manhattan, New York-based gynecologist named Robert L. Dickinson was preoccupied with what made women unhappy in their marriages. So many had complained to him that they didn't enjoy sex. This prompted the doctor, an early advocate of birth control devices and a passionate promoter of women's sexual pleasure, to conduct research -- loosely defined -- on some of his thousands of female patients. He studied their bodies and sketched their contours, looking for clues to their sensitivities and habits. Female genitals were texts for the doctor to read. But so were the tales of erotic misery -- or just plain indifference -- that his patients would tell him. The doctor compiled his years of clinical observation in two weighty tomes, ""A Thousand Marriages"" (1931) and ""The Single Woman"" (1934). Dickinson had a hunch that the growing presence of lesbians in New York and other cities was a symptom of a larger problem with heterosexuality. Women were turning to each other for sexual relations because men were bad lovers. Egads! Maybe the answer to the nagging question could be answered only by women. Dickinson thereafter proposed to write a book he never published -- one that would be addressed to men, husbands in particular, to teach them how to give pleasure to women. Waves of research on female sexual response followed throughout the 20th century, a time when Western society attempted to regulate pleasure by studying it in metric forms and through tortuous interviews and searching questionnaires. ""What's wrong with me?"" became a commonplace. And through this complex process, lacking desire has become, in many ways, regarded as just as dangerous as having too much desire -- maybe even more so, actually. Here we must turn to money and to the current news of the FDA panel's hearings last week to decide whether to approve the new pharmaceutical pill flibanserin. The drug joins a plethora of pleasure-enhancing drugs and devices that in one way or another are premised upon variations of Freud's nagging question. Developed by the German drug company Boehringer-Ingelheim, the ""little pink pill"" (""little blue"" Viagra's sister?) is meant to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder. How? By increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine (libido boosters) and decreasing seratonin (libido downers) in the brains of its sufferers. If the drug were approved, The New York Times reported, annual sales might reach $2 billion in the United States alone. Boehringer-Ingelheim had run a marketing campaign that consisted mainly of convincing women of a certain age and wealth strata that they lack sufficient sexual desire and that they deserve a remedy. In a market-driven society, convincing people that they lack something they need is what advertising is all about. ""Do I lack sexual desire?"" If you answer yes to this question -- and Boehringer-Ingelheim reports that 1,323 premenopausal women they studied did -- you become a member of the target market for flibanserin. The company's success or failure in the marketplace rests in large part on women realizing they don't have enough mojo. The company limited its subject sample to women living in the U.S. and Canada who were otherwise healthy, well-educated and mostly married -- ""normal"" but for their deficiency of desire. Studied in a double-blind trial over 24 months, women taking the pill reported that ""sexually satisfying events"" increased to about 4.5 a month, while those taking a placebo reported about 3.7 such events. Incidentally, according to the framework of the study, these events need not include orgasm. Q: What does a woman want? A: Flibanserin. Things just got so much easier! Or did they? For starters, ""hypoactive sexual desire disorder"" rests upon such vague criteria that the American Medical Association plans to remove it from the next edition of its authoritative diagnostic manual and replace it with ""desire-arousal disorder."" And, even if we grant its existence, studies that estimate at least 10 percent of American women suffer from HSDD were paid for by drug companies, The New York Times says. Boehringer-Ingelheim offers online medical education courses for health practitioners to get them involved in diagnosing HSDD. Doctors taking the courses are quizzed on how to diagnose the condition of various kinds of women. In one exercise, the test-taker is asked to figure out what is wrong with a 42-year-old working woman who cares for three children and an ailing mother, and lacks sexual desire. Her husband is a very minor character in the test's scenario. Dr. Dickinson may be spinning in his grave now. Psychologist Lenore Tiefer, who testified before the FDA panel Friday, put it well when she remarked that if the drug had been approved, it would have given women the false impression that they can take a pill to get ""the sex life they read about, the one they think everyone else is having."" One is tempted to ask whether the alleged upward trend in cases of HSDD in women can be correlated to the ""little blue pill's"" market debut in 1998. With all the talk of erectile dysfunction in men, maybe what women want now, sexually speaking, is a little less pressure to perform through pharmaceutically prolonged sexual encounters and a little more emotional support for their efforts, in and out of the bedroom. So what's next now that the FDA panel said no to flibanserin? An online course for male partners to teach them how to make love to women diagnosed with HSDD? That would be a start, but my guess is that what women want, particularly those who have come of age in an era of abstinence-only education, is knowledge about their bodies (for themselves and their partners) and respect for how their bodies work. Such knowledge may help them/us question whether a daily dose of yet another ""brain drug"" will give us what we have come to suspect we need. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer Terry.","Jennifer Terry: Freud asked what women wanted; ""female Viagra"" raises question again .

"(CNN) -- A tornado touched down Monday afternoon in Rutherford County, Tennessee, authorities there confirm. The tornado was on the ground for about 4 1/2 miles, said Joe Gourley of the Rutherford County Emergency Management Agency. Fewer than a dozen homes suffered minor to moderate damage, trees were toppled and roads were blocked, Gourley said. Minor damage was reported across much of the state after a line of severe thunderstorms swept through. The National Weather Service dispatched a team to survey possible tornado damage in Dickson County near Vanleer, where a homeowner said his barn was destroyed and several large trees were uprooted. There were also reports of at least one mobile home destroyed and others damaged in the area. No injuries were reported. Students were evacuated at Fairview Middle School in Franklin after lightning struck the school, causing a fire on the roof. All students were safe, school officials said on Twitter.","Severe storms sweep across Tennessee; no injuries reported .

"New York (CNN) -- A housekeeper at the U.S. Military Academy could face up to two years in jail if convicted of trying to steal a bag of frozen meatballs. Estelle Casimir pleaded not guilty in U.S. District Court in White Plains, New York, this month, according to her attorney. ""She is very upset,"" said Michael Ferraro. ""We've pleaded not guilty, definitely."" Casimir has been charged with stealing from the mess hall at the famed military academy in West Point, New York, on January 30. She faces two counts of misdemeanor crimes for stealing property and possessing stolen property. Each count carries a possible penalty of up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. According to a signed affidavit, the operations manager on duty at West Point, spotted Casimir trying to hide a black bag with her hand and asked her what it was. ""Nothing, it is garbage,"" Casimir reportedly replied. After some reluctance, Casimir revealed the bag of meatballs, the affidavit states. On the mess hall's menu that night: meatballs. ""If it is garbage why didn't you throw it away near the pantry area, where they have a dumpster by the door?"" the manager asked, according to the affidavit. Casimir claimed that she found the bag in a trash container and was going downstairs to throw it in another dumpster, the affidavit states. Pending the outcome of her case, Casimir has been suspended without pay by her employer, Watson Services, which provides food services at West Point, Ferraro said. Attempts to contact the military police at West Point, Watson Services and Casimir were unsuccessful. Ferraro said he'll be trying to reach an agreement with the assistant U.S. attorney. If he can't, Casimir is scheduled to be back in court on April 19. ""Obviously nobody wants to go to jail,"" he said.","Housekeeper is accused of trying to steal a bag of frozen meatballs .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The wrongful death trial of concert promoter AEG Live filed by Michael Jackson's mother and three children will not be televised, a judge decided Friday. CNN had requested its camera be allowed in the courtroom during the trial, but Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos issued a ruling Friday denying the request. California law leaves the decision to the trial judge's discretion based on 19 factors to be considered. Palazuelos did not say in her ruling what factors swayed her decision. AEG Live to put Michael Jackson on trial in his own death . AEG Live's lawyer argued televising the trial could create a frenzy among Jackson fans at the courthouse that could pose a threat to witnesses. Jackson lawyers argued in favor of having a camera in court, saying it would be the best way for the world to see justice done. Without cameras, only a handful of journalists will have seats in the small courtroom in downtown Los Angeles. The Jacksons' lawsuit accuses AEG Live of liability in Jackson's death through the negligent hiring of Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician who is serving a prison sentence after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Conrad Murray from jail: 'I was in the wrong place at the wrong time' AEG Live contends Murray was never its employee, but was chosen and hired by Jackson. If AEG Live is found liable by a jury, it could mean a multibillion dollar judgment for the Jacksons, based on the potential earnings of Michael Jackson had he lived past his 50th birthday. Opening statements and the first witness could be heard in about two weeks in the trial that is expected to last for two to three months. The pool of potential jurors reached 60 Friday afternoon after four days of eliminating jurors for hardship reasons. The process will continue Monday and Tuesday or until about 100 potential jurors are identified. On Wednesday, the lawyers will start the voir dire process of eliminating jurors based on cause or their jury strikes allowed under court rules. Until then, the lawyers are studying their answers to a long questionnaire the potential jurors completed. The process is expected to continue for another week, perhaps ending around April 16 or 17. It is unclear how soon after a jury is seated that the judge will have lawyers deliver opening statements and call the first witness. Some judges allow the jury a day or so to take care of personal business after being selected.","CNN asks the judge to allow its camera in the trial .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan, facing a new felony grand theft charge, will remain free on bond after a Los Angeles judge Wednesday revoked her probation in a previous case. Lohan faces a February 23 hearing on the alleged probation violation before Superior Court Judge Keith Schwartz, who could send her back to jail. The actress pleaded not guilty to the theft of a necklace allegedly taken from a California jewelry store last month. Schwartz revoked Lohan's probation in a 2007 drunken driving case. He issued a $20,000 bond for the theft charge and an additional $20,000 bond in the probation revocation. At her arraignment, Schwartz warned Lohan that she could be put back in jail if she violates the law. ""Please don't push your luck, I am telling you, the judge said. ""Things will be different."" The theft charge announced by prosecutors Wednesday comes five weeks after the actress was released from court-ordered drug rehabilitation and less than three weeks before a judge said he might free her from supervised probation from the drunken driving conviction. Lohan was smiling at times as she sat at the defense table before the arraignment. She wore a tight-fitting white knot dress, with her long blond hair loosely tied in the back. Lohan wore what appeared to be several diamond bracelets on her right arm, complemented by diamond earrings and a large diamond-filled ring on her right hand. The 24-year-old actress allegedly walked out of the Venice store with the necklace on January 22, a statement from the district attorney's office said. ""The owner reported the theft to the Los Angeles Police Department, which investigated the allegation and presented evidence to the D.A.'s office last week."" The necklace was handed over to police just before they were to execute a search warrant to look for the jewelry in Lohan's Venice, California, apartment last week, police said. Under California's grand theft law, prosecutor Danette Meyers must prove that Lohan intended to steal the jewelry and that she carried it away from the store. The penalty for a felony grand theft conviction ranges from 16 months to three years in a California state prison, varying based on the value of the property stolen and the criminal record of the defendant. Shoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than $950. The store owner claims the ""one of a kind"" necklace was worth $2,500, police said. The judge could reduce the charge to a misdemeanor, which would carry a prison sentence of no more than one year. ""We vehemently deny these allegations and, if charges are filed, we will fight them in court, not in the press,"" Holley said Saturday. Lohan is on supervised probation for a drunken driving conviction. The judge overseeing her case told her in October that he would send her to jail for 180 days if she violated her probation rules before her next court appearance, set for February 25. She left the Betty Ford clinic a month ago after three months in a drug rehabilitation program. The rehab stint persuaded the judge not to send Lohan to jail for failing a drug test.","Actress pleads not guilty at arraignment .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made a previously unannounced visit to Afghanistan on Monday to repair strained relations with President Hamid Karzai as the American-led international force continues to prepare to end its combat mission next year. Kerry's stop came on the same day that U.S. forces turned over control of a prison that has caused tension between the two nations, with Americans retaining a say on the handling of certain Taliban inmates. The talks on Monday followed controversial comments by Karzai in recent weeks that seemed to accuse U.S. forces of working with the Taliban to kill Afghan civilians, a charge denied by U.S. officials. Karzai's reported remarks caused outrage in Washington with some in Congress questioning why the United States should continue the war effort. At a joint news conference after meeting Kerry, Karzai said he had been misinterpreted when quoted as alleging collusion between the Americans and the Taliban. U.S. hands over Afghan prison . But he made clear that violence against villagers must stop for there to be any chance for successful peace talks. Karzai explained that he was talking about Taliban violence, especially how a bombing in Kabul that killed nine people didn't help achieve the Taliban goal of getting foreign troops to withdraw. He said media reports misinterpreted his comments to mean he was accusing the Taliban and United States of collusion. ""If they want the international community to leave Afghanistan, then the best way is for them to stop killing people,"" Karzai said of the Taliban. ""That does not mean a collusion between the Untied States and Taliban. That's a conclusion the press came up with."" Karzai also said some U.S. special forces in Wardak province had tortured and killed Afghan civilians, but that had stopped when those forces were removed under a recent agreement after his government complained. He made sure to emphasize his appreciation for U.S. support, twice declaring the thanks of the Afghan people for American assistance that he said would ""enable Afghanistan to manage itself through 2014 and beyond."" For his part, Kerry emphasized the commitment of President Barack Obama to Afghanistan and its people would continue past the halt in combat operations by the NATO forces before the end of next year. The United States and Afghanistan are negotiating an agreement that would allow some U.S. forces to remain in Afghanistan beyond the end of the NATO mission, but unresolved issues include how many and there specific role. Kerry said Obama ""was committed to not allow America's investment and the sacrifice here to be reversed,"" adding that ""the United States will still be playing a role and will be here through the course of this future period."" Meanwhile, the former commander of the international military force in Afghanistan, U.S. Gen. John Allen, said Monday that the war there would continue after foreign troops conclude their combat mission by the end of 2014. ""On the first of January, there's still going to be fighting in 2015. There's still going to be fighting in Afghanistan,"" Allen told a conference at the Brookings Institution. He added that Afghanistan would ""join a long and distinguished list of countries that will be struggling in a post-conflict environment where it will have an insurgency in some parts of that country for an extended period of time."" Kerry landed in Kabul on Monday afternoon and met with Karzai at the presidential palace before the news conference that lasted almost an hour. The two were to talk further over dinner and perhaps again on Tuesday morning, Kerry said. Earlier Monday, the United States handed over control of a U.S.-run prison near Bagram Air Base to Afghan authorities. Karzai called the development a major boost for the transition, while Kerry emphasized several times that the agreement respected Afghanistan's sovereignty to operate the prison that holds Taliban figures. The agreement includes provisions to give the United States a say on how some of the most notorious Taliban prisoners are handled. Karzai outlined a process in which U.S. officials provide intelligence to Afghan officials on specific prisoners, and further consultations follow if the Afghans want to set them free. In a sign of the sensitivity of the issue, Karzai twice described the final step of the process as consultations, then changed his wording to ""an exchange of views."" He said that ""I must use my words carefully."" ""We will consider it,"" he said of a U.S. request to keep particular prisoners in custody, adding that Afghan law would call for such handling of anyone posing a legitimate threat. The matter touches on a politically charged situation for Karzai, who is criticized by the Taliban and other foes for the continuing presence of the NATO forces in the country. The handover deal was reached Saturday, but came a full year after the initial plan was announced by U.S and Afghan authorities. An initial plan called for the prison and detainees to be handed over within six months, but in September, the United States ""paused"" the transfer of detainees, which include suspected Taliban militants and insurgents. Other tensions between the countries involve continuing violence, such as a bomb blast in Kabul this month that killed nine people. Karzai said afterward that there are ""ongoing daily talks between the Taliban, Americans and foreigners in Europe and in the Gulf states."" The comment effectively claimed the United States was trying to foment continued violence inside Afghanistan, and it was quickly denounced by NATO and U.S. officials. Some experts say Karzai's comments were fueled by frustration over the detention facility not being handed over sooner, which he viewed as an attack on his country's sovereignty. During the news conference, Kerry repeatedly referred to Afghanistan's sovereignty in the transition process as the NATO military force turns over leadership of combat operations to Afghanistan's military, which it has trained in recent years. Under an agreement between the Afghan government and NATO, the bulk of U.S. and NATO combat forces are to be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. What remains to be decided is how many troops may remain to help train Afghan forces. The trip was Kerry's first visit to Afghanistan as secretary of state, but the former senator's sixth during Obama's presidency. He was in Iraq over the weekend to press that nation's leaders to take steps prohibiting Iranian planes from delivering arms to Syria's besieged government. Last week, Kerry joined Obama on a trip to Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Barbara Starr, Chelsea J. Carter and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Kerry pledges U.S. commitment to Afghanistan beyond 2014 .

"London (CNN) -- The year is 1962 and at Bromley Technical High School in London the lad who will become David Bowie is about to announce his musical intentions. Read review of David Bowie's new album . As the line of schoolboys shuffles into the makeshift careers office, the boy steps forward. His friend George Underwood takes up the story. ""I was right behind David and the careers officer said 'So Mr. David Jones, what is it you are planning to do when you leave school?' And David said, 'Well I wanna be a saxophonist in a modern jazz quartet!' I laughed my head off after that because they didn't know how to pigeon hole people and they went down the category of music careers and he said 'I've got an interview for a job at a harp factory in Bromley' -- that's the nearest thing they had to music which I thought was hilarious."" Music had already brought the two boys together as friends through a common interest in skiffle (""the punk music of its time"" offers George) and membership of a church choir. Their vocal harmonies continued at school, singing Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly songs in the reverb-rich stairwell outside the art block, encouraged by their charismatic art master, Owen Frampton. Why we're just glad to have Bowie back . Frampton's son Peter joined the school three years after George and David and was soon in search of musical companions. ""I asked my father who was head of the art department at the school, who was into music,"" says Frampton, "" and he said well there's this David Jones character -- he seems to play guitar and sax."" ""So it was the three of us exchanging licks really -- they taught me Buddy Holly numbers and I showed them what I knew on guitar --so that's when our friendship started on those stone steps."" Underwood and Jones formed a firm friendship, which led to an uncanny coincidence. ""David's mother and my mother -- who didn't know each other -- were both knitting jumpers for us and lo and behold it was the same pattern and we were walking down Bromley High Street with the same jumpers like we were trying to pull birds!"" David's fondness for American radio led to an interest in American football results. ""No one at that time was into American football in those days. But David liked the image of the big shoulder pads and there was a certain glamor about the way they looked and he thought I'll get into American football."" When Jones wrote to the U.S. Embassy in London about his enthusiasm the two boys were invited to visit and try on the equipment, the shoulder pads seeming like an inspiration for the wardrobe of the future Ziggy Stardust. But even best friends can have disagreements -- particularly when they are teenage boys trying to date the same girl. ""I managed to chat her up and arranged to meet her a couple of days later in this club. And David was rather annoyed and said, 'Actually Carol doesn't want to go out with you she wants to go out with me and she didn't have the heart to tell you.'"" George says David convinced him that the girl wouldn't turn up for the meeting. ""I was upset but I decided to go down to the club an hour and a half later and her mate said she had waited for me for an hour and David had made me look like a right prat."" Next day George couldn't contain himself when he heard David saying he had won George's girl. ""I just saw red and I don't go around hitting people I promise you that -- honest -- I wasn't that type. I knew David wouldn't fight me and I was so annoyed I just went like that."" (he makes a punching gesture). Peter Frampton takes up the story. ""I remember the day because my father came home very agitated and told the story of one of his pupils hit the other one and there was a fight or something and I heard that Jones had to be taken to hospital but that's all I knew I didn't actually see it happen. But the unfortunate thing is that as well as teaching art my dad also taught boxing and George was in his class so I think my father felt rather responsible!"" The incident left David with a frozen pupil, giving the effect that he has eyes of different colors, which contributed to the other-worldly look which became synonymous with the image of Bowie. ""Oh God my stomach was turning,"" says Underwood. ""That was the last thing I wanted. But anyway we made up and years later he told me I did him a favor so I don't feel so bad about it now!"" All three boys dreamed of becoming pop stars. George and David played together in bands such as The Kon-rads and The King Bees but it was George who scored the first hit recording under the name Calvin James. Peter left school early at 16 to join hit-making bands The Herd and Humble Pie. That's when David Jones -- now performing as David Bowie -- took his first big step towards stardom. ""When we were on the roads together David's first single 'Space Oddity' went to number 1"" says Frampton. ""He was number 1 in Europe and Humble Pie we were number 2 with 'Natural Born Boogie.'"" The Bromley Tech alumni had arrived. George quit music to focus on art and David asked him to work on three of his most famous album covers -- ""David Bowie,"" ""Hunky Dory"" and ""Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars."" He was invited along on the ""Ziggy Stardust"" tour to America, crossing the Atlantic on the QE2 liner, where David astonished other diners by turning up for dinner in full Ziggy costume. Underwood recalls the reaction of the fans on that pivotal tour. ""The audience were just standing with their mouths open looking at him thinking, 'What am I seeing here?' It was interesting seeing that from the ground floor every night."" After achieving huge success as a solo artist -- ""Frampton Comes Alive"" remains one of the best-selling live albums in music history -- Peter Frampton suffered a series of setbacks which left his career in tatters, until David invited him to record and tour with him in the 1980s. ""I can't thank him enough for asking me. There are so many other people he could have asked. But he was very aware of what had happened to me as far as my musical credibility disappearing because of the pop icon deal that happened to me. It was very special of him to see that and take me back to places that I couldn't fill any more ... those kind of venues and take me around the world and reintroduce me as the guitar player and I still owe him."" Peter went on to win a Grammy for his 2006 album ""Fingerprints"" while George has developed a career in painting which has included exhibitions at London's prestigious Royal Academy. All three remain firm friends today and plan to download the new album. Underwood says he wasn't concerned about Bowie's 10-year absence from recording. ""I'm sure he'd let me know if there was anything wrong. There's all this speculation about his health but don't worry folks, he's fine -- the album proves it doesn't it?"" ""A lot of people have copied what he has done, in terms of re-inventing himself all the time, just when you think he's got him figured out,"" says Frampton. ""He's an actor, he's a musician, he's an artist and he puts them all together and does what he wishes when he wishes and he's very confident about what he does. But he's the same guy I went to school with.""","Peter Frampton and George Underwood recall their long friendship with David Bowie .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Renee Patterson's most precious present this Christmas won't be under her tree, and it didn't come from a store. This holiday, she said, she got her life back. The Upper Marlboro, Maryland, resident learned nine years ago she had kidney disease. One of her kidneys began to deteriorate, and she had to begin regular dialysis. Because she couldn't find a family match, her former colleague and friend, Michael Williams, offered to donate one of his kidneys. Problem was, Patterson and Williams didn't match either. But Patterson's doctor suggested they look into the paired kidney donation program at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. She became part a massive mix-and-match transplant effort in the U.S., involving more than a dozen kidneys. Watch more on the 26-person transplant . ""When I tell people how I got my kidney, they say, 'Wow,'"" said Patterson. ""I'm amazed myself."" As of this week, 84,000 people are waiting for a kidney donation, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which keeps an updated list. According to the Alliance for Paired Donation, many people who need kidney transplants have family members or friends willing to give a kidney, only to find out that their blood and tissue are not compatible with their intended recipient. But now through these so-called paired kidney donation programs, offered by hospitals that specialize in transplantation, people who otherwise would remain ill or on dialysis are getting a new lease on life. In paired kidney donation, one incompatible donor/recipient pair, such as Patterson and Williams, are matched with another pair in the same situation, so that the donor of the first kidney gives to the recipient of the second, and vice versa. In larger kidney exchanges, donors and recipients are mixed and matched, giving more people the chance to obtain a new kidney. According to the National Kidney Foundation and the Alliance for Paired Donation, paired donation will one day allow for an additional 3,000 living donor kidney transplants a year in the U.S. After they learned what was involved, Patterson and Williams put themselves on a list. ""He just signed,"" said Patterson. ""I said, 'What are you doing? Are you sure?' And he shook his head yes."" ""It was kind of jumping out there on faith,"" Williams said. ""And lo and behold, it's working out for her."" Three weeks later, Patterson and Williams were told they would be part of the 26-person transplant effort, coordinated through Georgetown University Hospital and Washington Hospital Center. Believed to be one of the largest such procedures ever completed in the U.S., there would be 13 donors and 13 recipients. Patterson was elated, because she would no longer need dialysis. ""It happened so fast. I had been on the transplant list for so long, over a year and a half,"" she explained. "" And then all of a sudden, I was getting a kidney."" That kidney would come from a Washington businesswoman by the name of Leslie Wolfe. Wolfe was in a similar situation. She was willing to give a kidney to her best friend's husband, Stuart Bloch. But they didn't match. Wolfe, along with Block, joined a list at Georgetown University Hospital. ""If you can do something that is not life-threatening to you, that could save someone else's life, why would you say no?"" Wolfe asked. By melding their donor and recipient lists together, Georgetown and Washington Hospital Center could mix and match patients. The procedure would take six days to complete with doctors performing surgery on two to three patients a day. Dr. Joseph Melancon, head of the kidney-pancreas transplantation unit at Georgetown University Hospital, oversaw the project. ""All the recipients had donors that they didn't match with,"" he said. ""And they had to receive a transplant via a paired kidney exchange."" On the last day of surgeries, Wolfe's kidney was removed, cleaned and readied to be transported to Washington Hospital Center, where Patterson's doctors were waiting to implant the new organ. Bloch had already received his transplant. Williams' kidney, removed the same day Patterson received hers, was sent to a patient at Georgetown. By criss-crossing patients, 13 people, 11 of whom were minorities, were able to renew their lives. According the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Minority Health, the rate of organ donation in minority communities does not keep pace with the number needing transplants. Many times, it's because of fear of the medical community or mistrust of the system. Health experts say that's unfortunate. A report by HHS noted, ""although minorities donate in proportion to their share of the population, their need for transplants is much greater."" African Americans, the report said, make up about 13 percent of the population and about 12 percent of donors, but they represent 23 percent of the patients on the kidney waiting list. Citing the critical need, Melancon is urging minorities to join the exchange programs. ""It's very important for minorities to receive living transplants, because their outcome with deceased donor transplants are not as good as everyone else,"" Melancon said. Additionally, years of dialysis can lead to a build-up of antibodies, which can cause rejection of the new organ. That's especially true for minorities, because they tend to stay on dialysis much longer. Patients who have this build-up of antibodies receive a blood cleansing procedure called plasmapheresis to trick their bodies into accepting the kidney without rejection. On Monday morning,  Leslie Wolfe visited Renee Patterson in her hospital room at Washington Hospital Center. Along with Michael Williams and Renee's mother Sandra Patterson, they all laughed and hugged. At one point, it got pretty emotional. ""This is too much for me,"" said Renee, as she wiped away her tears. ""I did this for my son, so I could be there for him. But these people made it possible."" ""Leslie has given me her kidney. I can't thank her enough and as for Michael -- he's my Superman,"" Patterson said. ""He's saving my life, because [without him] I wouldn't be able to be in this circle. At the same time, he's saving somebody else's life.""","NEW: Renee Patterson met her donor, Leslie Wolfe, on Monday .

"(CNN) -- ABC News' Barbara Walters is expressing regret for attempting to help the daughter of Syria's U.N. ambassador by seeking an internship or college admission for her. ""In retrospect, I realize that this created a conflict and I regret that,"" Walters said in a statement Tuesday. After Walters returned to the United States from a December ABC interview with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, she said, Sheherazad Jaafari contacted her. Jaafari, the daughter of Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Jaafari, was described in March as a Syrian government press officer in New York. Sheherazad Jaafari appears to have a close relationship with the Syrian president, according to e-mails obtained by CNN. In e-mails from Jaafari to al-Assad, she writes, ""hey handsome"" and adds ""I love u."" Walters said Wednesday that Jaafari was ""looking for a job"" when she contacted her. ""I told her that was a serious conflict of interest and that we would not hire her. I did offer to mention her to contacts at another media organization and in academia."" Walters sent an e-mail to CNN's Piers Morgan and his executive producer, Jonathan Wald, recommending Jaafari, describing her as a ""sensational young woman."" CNN has said ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" was contacted by Walters on Jaafari's behalf; however, she was never interviewed or hired as an intern. Morgan himself denied having any contact with Jaafari. In an article published in March in the British newspaper Daily Mail, Morgan wrote that an e-mail from Jaafari to al-Assad had surfaced in which she mentions a meeting with the CNN anchor. ""I am meeting Piers Morgan tomorrow ... I feel appreciated here!"" Jaafari wrote in that e-mail. Morgan wrote in the newspaper, ""I had absolutely no idea what the hell this was all about until I recalled that a famous American TV interviewer had recently recommended I consider this lady -- daughter of Syria's ambassador to the U.N. -- for a job at my CNN show. ""We didn't meet, nor speak, nor in fact have any contact at all. And given the nature of her e-mail correspondence, I don't think you should expect Ms Jaafari to be popping up in my programme title credits any time soon,"" Morgan wrote. Walters also e-mailed a professor at Columbia University's journalism school on Jaafari's behalf. The professor, Richard Wald, is the father of Jonathan Wald. Walters later sent a follow-up e-mail to Jonathan Wald, advising him not to bother following up with Jaafari, since she did not have an appropriate U.S. visa. Walters said in her statement Wednesday that Jaafari ""didn't get a job or into school."" On her rÃ©sumÃ©, Jaafari said she graduated from college in June 2010 and for a year after graduation was an account executive at Brown Lloyd James, a public relations firm in New York. Before that, she said, she was an intern at the Syrian Mission to the United Nations and an assistant to the president of the U.N. General Assembly. Howard Kurtz, the host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" said the incident makes Walters ""seem a little too cozy"" with someone close to the Syrian regime. ""This looks like a bit of a quid pro quo,"" Kurtz said Wednesday. ""This woman was close to Assad, the daughter of the ambassador, helps her arrange the interview, and the next day they're on e-mail talking about helping her -- Barbara Walters helping her to either get into an Ivy League school or land a media internship."" In his interview with ABC, al-Assad maintained that he is not in charge of Syria's military, which opposition groups say has conducted a brutal crackdown on dissent in the country over the past year in which thousands have died. ""They are not my forces,"" he said. ""They are forces for the government. I don't own them. I'm president. I don't own the country."" Walters, in her statement Wednesday, described the interview as ""hard-hitting"" and said ""the fallout for Assad from the interview was such that the Syrian government went to great lengths to discredit me and ABC News."" Jaafari was among those who coached al-Assad before the interview on how to describe the violence, according to e-mails purportedly from Syrian officials released in February by the hacking group known as Anonymous. ""Don't talk reform,"" Jaafari wrote in one e-mail. ""American's (sic) won't care, or understand that. ... American psyche can be easily manipulated when they hear that there are 'mistakes' done and now we are 'fixing it.'"" After the interview aired December 7, Jaafari wrote to al-Assad, in an e-mail obtained by CNN, ""I'm still awake and I am being updated by my father and through the embassy and Barbara's team ... it's extremely positive ... the whole U.S. is talking about this."" ""Ur amazing,"" she told the president, adding that he looked like ""a 25-years-old super star."" In other e-mails from Jaafari to al-Assad, she strikes a more personal tone. ""I miss ur voice already,"" she wrote him in late December. ""Give me a call whenever u can so I could get some energy from you and tell you how much I misss u."" ""I am coming today. I will arrive there tomorrow,"" she wrote in January, telling him she wanted to see him, ""no excuses ... miss uuu, please please please."" ""Hey handsome,"" she began an e-mail to the president three days later, including a suggestive story about a relative. ""I love u,"" she added. ""I hope ur doing well in school and at the gym. Be nicer."" CNN's Gena Somra and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Walters contacted CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" on the woman's behalf .

"(CNN) -- The body of a young man found in the Providence River on Tuesday may be that of Sunil Tripathi, a student at Brown University who disappeared March 16, police told CNN. A Brown rowing coach reported a body in the river near India Point Park, Lindsay Lague, a spokeswoman for the Providence Police Department, said Wednesday. Lague said authorities may be able to identify the body as soon as Thursday morning. When asked if it might be Tripathi, Detective Mark Sacco said it was ""likely"" but was cautious to say they won't know who it is until the medical examiner makes a determination. The body is a man between the ages of 18 and 30, he said. The Tripathi family's search for the 22-year-old philosophy major has been detailed on a Facebook page, ""Help us find Sunil Tripathi."" They temporarily took down the page after they were inundated by ugly comments when Sunil Tripathi was falsely accused on social media of being one of the Boston Marathon bombers. After the FBI released images of Suspect 1 and Suspect 2, people took to sites such as Reddit, a real-time message board, and Twitter speculating that Tripathi looked like one of the suspects. Reddit's general manager apologized to the Tripathi family for the misinformation. Tripathi was last seen in the early hours of March 16, recorded on a security video walking south on Brook Street in Providence, not far from his home. His last recorded computer activity was shortly before that sighting. ""He was seen on the 15th, Friday, hanging out with his friends, talking to family members, all normal activities, nothing out of the ordinary that anyone detected,"" his brother Ravi told CNN affiliate WPRI on April 10. Since then a desperate search has been on for Tripathi, known to family and friends as ""Sunny."" Tripathi, who had been struggling with depression, was last seen wearing blue jeans, a black Eastern Mountain Sports ski jacket, glasses and a black Philadelphia Eagles wool hat. He was said to be 6 feet tall, 130 pounds, with short, dark hair. By March 17, nobody had seen him for 24 hours, and a friend became concerned and called the police. At that point, the family was notified and came up from Philadelphia as soon as they could, Ravi said. ""We are a very tight-knit family, and it's very out of the ordinary that he would be not in contact for even 24 hours,"" Ravi told WPRI. ""He spoke with his aunt, he spoke with his grandmother Friday night, he texted with my mum, all normal activities, and then his cell phone was left in his apartment along with his wallet and ID, which is totally atypical for him."" The FBI and other agencies launched a search of Providence, Rhode Island, and nearby cities after he was reported missing, but no trace was found. Over the past month, Ravi has appeared on local and national networks appealing for help to find his sibling, the youngest of three. At the time he went missing, Sunil Tripathi was on approved leave from the Ivy League school, meaning that he had requested and was granted time off but remained a student there. Sunil had taken the time off to figure out exactly what he wanted to do, Ravi told WPRI. He described his brother as a quiet person who enjoyed the little things in life. His preferred food was vegetarian and he was a talented saxophonist, the family said. ""Our concerns are first and foremost with Sunil and his family,"" Margaret Klawunn, vice president for student life and campus services at Brown University, said last month. ""We are hopeful that by encouraging the Brown community to help spread the word that Sunil will be located."" Sunil had been living in Providence since 2008 but grew up in Radnor, Pennsylvania. The family, including Sunil's sister, Sangeeta, tried to find him by re-creating the sequence of events early on March 16, in the hope of finding a clue to where he might have gone. They also got the word out by posting fliers, canvassing the area, working with law enforcement and sought to harness the power of social media. A tweet a week ago on the family's Twitter page, Finding Sunny, said: ""Sunny day. We're out in Providence postering away -- learning the nooks and crannies of every block of this town.... "" A moving video was posted on YouTube on April 8, simply titled ""For Sunny,"" in which family and friends appeal for him to come home, telling him how much they love him and want to see him. The family ""want to know that he's safe,"" Ravi told WPRI just six days before the Boston bombing. ""All we really want to know is that he's around and that he's okay. ""And we would like him to know that we love him deeply and we miss him a lot.""","A medical examiner will determine whether a body is that of a missing student .

"(CNN) -- Pro football player Donte Stallworth was in stable condition Sunday after a hot air balloon he was riding in crashed into power lines, his lawyer said. Doctors at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital were treating Stallworth and a female companion for severe burns, attorney Christopher Lyons said. Police said the hot air balloon they were riding in plunged to the ground after hitting power lines in Miami on Saturday. The balloon's pilot was not injured, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. ""I appreciate all the prayers and well wishes more than you know,"" Stallworth said in a Twitter post late Saturday. ""I feel lucky to be alive."" The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating with the help of Miami-Dade police, Detective Roy Rutland said. The California native began his NFL career in 2002 with the New Orleans Saints and most recently played for the New England Patriots. He is a free agent. Drew Rosenhaus, Stallworth's sports agent, said Saturday that his client is ""in good spirits."" ""He was injured, but will be fine,"" said Rosenhaus, adding later that he hopes Stallworth is back playing ""in a matter of weeks."" ""He will be able to resume his NFL career,"" Rosenhaus said. Beyond his on-field exploits -- from his time at the University of Tennessee to his years playing with the Saints, Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles, Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens and Washington Redskins -- Stallworth is known for hitting and killing construction worker Mario Reyes, who was crossing a street in Miami in 2009. Under a plea agreement, Stallworth was sentenced to 30 days in jail for DUI manslaughter. He also reached an ""amicable"" settlement with the Reyes family, Lyons said. The NFL also suspended him for one season.

"(CNN) -- If you've thrown a birthday party recently, you might have personally experienced the shortages or price hikes intermittently hitting the helium market. Unfortunately, balloon customers are not the only ones being affected. Many helium users, from scientists to manufacturers in a number of industries, have experienced the negative impact of helium shortages and rising prices. If steps aren't taken to develop and put into place a long-term strategy for managing this valuable and non-renewable resource, things can get worse. Everyone has benefited, to some degree, from research made possible by liquid helium. Cell phones, iPads and laptops are possible because of experiments enabled by liquid helium. In the medical world, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is but one example of a host of diagnostic and treatment tools that exist only as a result of groundbreaking experiments carried out by using helium. In fact, the strong and extremely stable magnetic field that MRI devices require to work is accomplished by immersing powerful superconducting magnets inside liquid helium. Manufacturers of fiber optics cable and semiconductors used in electronic components rely on helium. And these are just a few examples of the importance of helium. Those who are particularly hard hit are members of the scientific community. An interruption in helium supply can cause weeks or even months of work to become useless. For many of these researchers, helium costs are a significant fraction of their operating budgets. The large increases in helium prices that they have experienced over the last few years have placed them in a tight financial bind. Opinion: Don't deflate the party . So, is there anything that can be done? One of the main causes of the current shortage is the nature of the helium market itself. Helium, unlike most other gases, is a minor byproduct in the production of natural gas. Those fissures and crevices that have trapped natural gas below the Earth's surface are also capable of trapping helium, although typically in small amounts. It takes a certain minimum level of helium concentration to make it economically viable to separate out the helium from the natural gas. As a consequence, out of the thousands of sources of natural gas that exist, only 14 are being processed for their helium content. And when more than a few of those helium sources are shut down for maintenance and repair, as they have been over the last few months, helium shortages can occur. Decades ago, the U.S. established the Federal Helium Reserve to provide a readily available supply of helium for defense, space, and scientific research needs. The reserve, located in the Texas panhandle, is the only long-term substantial storage source for helium in the world. In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. bought and stored significant amounts of helium there. In 1996, Congress directed the Bureau of Land Management, the agency in charge of the Reserve, to sell off helium in order to recoup some of the costs associated with its purchase. Under current law, those sales are to be completed by the beginning of 2015, less than two years away. Right now, the helium being sold by BLM accounts for more than 30% of the helium sold worldwide. Once BLM ends its sales of helium as required by current law, the impact on the availability and price for helium is expected to be significant. At the request of BLM, the National Research Council studied these issues and made recommendations, including a series of steps to help properly manage the helium reserve for the long term, strategies to protect the most vulnerable of users such as scientists, and ways to develop and implement a plan to protect this very important resource. The time is ripe to update the nation's policies and programs for managing helium. If it's done right, our children will continue to be able to celebrate their birthdays with balloons, and grow up to develop critical new technologies that they'll need to prosper in the next century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Moses Chan and Jim Lancaster.","Moses Chan, Jim Lancaster: Everyone has benefited from research involving helium .

"(CNN) -- Among science fiction and fantasy, there are a genres and sub-genres: hard science, swords and sorcery, cyberpunk, steampunk, apocalyptic stories, time travel and space opera, just to name a few. Each has its hardcore fans, and rarely do these stories stray from their roots by mixing elements. Someone forgot to mention this to author Adam Christopher. His new novel, ""The Age Atomic,"" defies classification as it incorporates elements across the sci-fi and fantasy spectrum. Christopher has let his imagination run wild, with some fantastic results. ""The Age Atomic,"" out Tuesday, is a sequel to Christopher's equally impressive ""Empire State."" Both books take place in New York City as well as its parallel but not quite mirror image, the Empire State, a version of Manhattan that exists in an alternate universe. The two versions of the city are linked together by a fissure, a fiery blue portal that allows characters to travel back and forth between universes. Imagine being able to step into another world and meet a similar but slightly different version of yourself. If you ever watched the show ""Fringe,"" you get the idea. Christopher's ""Empire State"" took place in a reimagined 1930s Prohibition-era United States. ""The Age Atomic"" picks up in the 1950s. Dwight Eisenhower is president, the communist ""red scare"" has swept the nation, and a secretive government group called Atoms for Peace is preparing for war against an unknown enemy. Now there's trouble in the ""other"" New York. The fissure connecting the two worlds has flickered out, and the Empire State is slowly dying. Private eye Rad Bradley is pulled into a secret plot to reboot the fissure, reconnecting the two universes and hopefully saving his version of New York. All this while preventing a transdimensional invasion of killer robots. Did I forget to mention the killer robots? There are also costumed superheroes and villains, secret agents clad in black suits and a pair of mad scientists. There's no shortage of plot or action in ""The Age Atomic,"" which echoes the pulp sci-fi genres that reached their height in 1930s comic books and noir detective fiction. Christopher grew up in New Zealand watching ""Doctor Who"" and listening to the Beatles. He now lives in England, where he's hard at work on several upcoming projects. He recently talked to CNN about his new novel. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What was the spark behind ""The Age Atomic""? Christopher: Even as I was writing ""Empire State,"" I knew there were more adventures for the main character, private detective Rad Bradley, to have. I also knew that the world was far larger than what I'd presented in book one. I'm a big New York history buff and had collected a whole lot of interesting stuff to use in a new story. As with Judge Crater in ""Empire State,"" I found a lot of real-life characters and places to use: Atoms for Peace, Evelyn McHale, The Cloud Club, 125th Street, to name just a few. The nature of the universe also meant I could shuffle forward in time a few years, to the 1950s, which would let me write a different kind of story. If ""Empire State"" is from the Golden Age of comic books, then ""The Age Atomic"" is the Silver Age, with all the craziness that entails. Throw in some atomic robots, the Red Menace and an electric ghost, and I had my idea! CNN: This novel and its prequel, ""Empire State,"" are both a mix of pulp fiction, detective novel, superhero story, science fiction and fantasy. Was it difficult to blend these genres? Christopher: Both books were a lot of fun to write, but I never thought about genre or worried about getting everything to fit. I had the story, I had the characters, and it all just came together. It also just happened to have everything I love about science fiction and fantasy jammed together, but I think that's part of the appeal of ""Empire State."" ""The Age Atomic ""is a little more controlled. Having introduced so many disparate elements in the first book, I could focus on telling a more linear sci-fi story in the second. It's basically all just science fiction ... or should that be science fantasy? CNN: You've said you were a fan of ""Doctor Who"" growing up. Does the TV series remain an inspiration and what about other influences? Christopher: ""Doctor Who"" is where my love of science fiction and fantasy started. I was introduced to it when I was 8, and I'm still an avid viewer. It still influences me in a way, as the original series (my true love) emphasized the importance of story and character over flashy special effects, which they had to, given the limitations of TV production in the 1960s and 1970s. But I think it taught me some good lessons about storytelling. I read a lot of science fiction, but I also mixed it up with a lot of other genres: crime, literary fiction, as well as nonfiction. Author-wise, I'm a fan of Stephen King, Lauren Beukes, Robert McCammon, Raymond Chandler, Greg Rucka, Ed Brubaker and Gail Simone, among many others. Comics are a hugely important part of my life, particularly crime and mystery comics (including Criminal, Stumptown, High Crimes) and superhero comics (both the Marvel and DC varieties). I have to say I prefer television to film. We're in a bit of a golden age of genre television, I think, with the likes of ""Person of Interest,"" ""The Walking Dead,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and many others. Not to mention an age of great TV writing, period! Just look at ""Justified,"" ""Longmire,"" ""Boardwalk Empire,"" ""House of Cards."" The old writer's advice to throw your TV out the window is looking more and more outdated. CNN: You're originally from New Zealand, now living in the UK and writing about the U.S. Have you tapped into a universal language among sci-fi fans? Christopher: There are similarities and differences, certainly. New Zealand seems to be somewhere in the middle, culturally, between the UK and the U.S., which is possibly a useful foundation for me. I think you can tell the difference between British and American science fiction and fantasy, although it's sometimes not something you can definitively put your finger on. It seems more obvious in other genres like crime. British crime novels are very different to American crime novels, which is a natural divergence, obviously, as crime and mystery are usually set in the here and now, and the UK and U.S. are different places, shared language and experience aside. My own writing has perhaps more of an American flavor than a British one, but that's because the stories I've so far written have needed it. ""Empire State,"" ""Seven Wonders"" and ""The Age Atomic"" are all very place-centric, where the setting itself is almost a character.

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A 73-year-old Japanese woman on Saturday became the oldest woman to climb Mount Everest breaking her own 10-year-old record. Tamae Watanabe reached the top of the 8,848-meter (29,028 feet) peak at 7 a.m, according to Ang Tshering, of the China Tibet Mountaineering Association. Watanabe climbed Everest from the nothern slope in Tibet-China and started on her final part of her climb at 8:30 p.m. Friday leaving the 8,300-meter staging area with three sherpas. The final push to the summit was made at night because it becomes very windy after mid-morning. In 2002, at the age of 63, she reached the summit from the southern slope in Nepal. Everest lies on the border of Nepal and Tibet-China. The oldest person to climb Everest is Nepali national Min Bahadur Sherchan who achieved the feat at the age of 76 in 2008. The youngest person is American teenager Jordan Romero from California who reached the summit in 2010 when he was 13. In 2011, an 82-year-old man died on the mountain while trying to set the record of being the oldest person to reach the summit. So far about 4,000 people have climbed Everest.","Tamae Watanabe also climbed the mountain in 2002 when she was 63 .

"(CNN) -- Has there ever been a rivalry in a sporting team quite like the one between Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber? Their fractious, not to say poisonous, relationship reached a new low on Sunday, after the three-time world champion ignored Red Bull team orders to snatch victory from Australian Webber at the Malaysian Grand Prix. With another three weeks before the next grand prix -- the Chinese GP on April 14 -- Webber plans to going surfing as he reflects on his treatment by Vettel and his place in the Red Bull hierarchy. ""I'll be catching a few waves on my surfboard and reflecting on everything that's happened,"" Webber told reporters. ""There were a lot of things going through my head in those closing laps,"" he said. ""Not just from today, but from the past as well."" The past probably includes the 2010 Turkish Grand Prix, a race in which Webber was flying when, on the verge of a hat-trick of wins, he and Vettel famously crashed -- leading to a sense of ill feeling within the team. Despite protestations in public to say otherwise from team principal Christian Horner, the frustration for Webber is that he is very much the team's understudy. Vettel has long been nurtured by Helmut Marko, titled a motorsport consultant at Red Bull but widely regarded as the eyes, ears and mouth piece of team owner Dietrich Mateschitz, and a figure Webber has not always seen eye to eye with. ""Seb made his own decisions and will have protection as usual,"" continued Webber after Sunday's race, a not too subtle reference to the Australian's apparent place in the Red Bull pecking order. ""It's something that Sebastian has apologized for and it's something that we will discuss internally as a team,"" added Horner, who in February at the launch of the RB9 had insisted: ""As a team we will do the very best we can to support both drivers."" But former McLaren driver John Watson went so far as to say that Red Bull should suspend Vettel for one race. ""If Christian Horner doesn't reassert his authority in the team -- because he has been totally subjugated by Sebastian Vettel yesterday -- then his position in the team is not exactly the role it is designed to be,"" Watson told BBC Radio on Monday. ""The only conclusion I can reach is that Vettel should be suspended for the next grand prix. ""You can't take the points away from him and give them to Mark Webber - that's now history and Sebastian has the benefit of those seven additional points."" After the event, Vettel was apologetic, suggesting the incident had been a misunderstanding rather than a direct violation of team orders. ""I didn't mean to and I apologize, "" Vettel told reporters. ""I'm not happy I've won, I made a mistake and if I could undo it I would. It's not easy right now and I owe apologies to Mark and the team."" The Malaysia Grand Prix also raised more questions about the very essence of the sport with teams handing down orders to drivers rather than allowing them to race. While Vettel ignored a call to stay behind his teammate Webber, Lewis Hamilton benefited from team orders. The 2008 world champion claimed his first podium finish for Mercedes after colleague Nico Rosberg was told not to attack him as both drivers were seeking to maintain their cars. Team orders have long been a controversial part of F1, and were banned in 2002. However, that rule was dropped in 2011 after it became apparent that teams were finding ways around it.","Sebastian Vettel defies team orders to pass and claim first win of 2013 .

"Vicksburg, Mississippi (CNN) -- When Mary Washington died in 2006 at the age of 54, she carried 260 pounds on her 4-foot-11-inch frame. ""Cancer killed her, but obesity restricted her life,"" said Washington's sister, Linda Fondren. ""Her last words to me were, 'Linda, I wish I had lived my life more for myself.' "" Washington had been a single mother, working multiple jobs in the food service industry to make ends meet. ""She did not know that she could do both,"" Fondren said. ""You can be of service to people ... but you must take care of yourself first."" It's not an uncommon story in Mississippi. Its nickname is the ""Hospitality State,"" but for the last six years it has been the fattest state in the nation, according to a 2009 report by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 34.4 percent of Mississippi's adults are obese, meaning they have a body mass index of 30 or more. Fondren, 54, wants to move her state from the fattest to the fittest. For the last four years, she has led her hometown of Vicksburg in its battle with the bulge. Being the fattest state ""is not a good heavyweight title to hold,"" she said. ""I felt that people needed to be challenged."" Fondren remembered how her sister had been too embarrassed to exercise in a gym with men. So in June 2006, she opened an all-female workout facility, Shape Up Sisters. The gym was a success -- it now has more than 600 members -- but Fondren eventually realized that she needed to expand her reach if she wanted to slim down her community. She says part of the problem in Vicksburg is that being overweight is so commonplace it is often considered the norm. ""Most people ... they do not know that they have a weight problem because we live in an environment where everyone almost looks the same,"" she said. So in October 2009, Fondren kicked off Shape Up Vicksburg. The initiative challenged residents to lose weight while giving them the tools they needed to reach their goal. Fondren held free fitness and nutrition classes across the city and convinced many of the city's restaurants to add healthy items to their menus. Participants could track their weight loss online or at weigh-in stations at Wal-Mart and the local medical center. ""People want to do good, but they need help,"" Fondren said. Approximately 2,500 people joined Fondren's movement, and over 17 weeks they shed, on average, more than 5 pounds each. To date, residents have lost nearly 15,000 pounds. Many attribute the success to Fondren's relentless determination. ""She takes no prisoners. She's committed to weight loss,"" said Vicksburg Mayor Paul Winfield, who lost 16 pounds. Today, Shape Up Vicksburg includes a walking club, which draws up to 200 people, and a weekly nutrition class. Fondren's gym is also open to all women every Saturday, and she frequently teaches fitness classes at area schools and churches. All of these activities are free, something she believes is a critical factor. ""It's the poor African-American and white communities that are the most obese, and those are the ones that are most unreachable,"" Fondren said. As a successful real estate developer, Fondren largely funds the effort herself, but the initiative also receives donations from local businesses. Ebony Fisher, 22, believes the program saved her life. After her 32-year-old cousin died of kidney failure last year, Fisher, who weighed 320 pounds, was frightened. ""I felt as though if I didn't lose weight I was going to die,"" she said. But fear drove her to take action. Since joining Shape Up Vicksburg six months ago, Fisher has lost 50 pounds. It's those stories that keep Fondren motivated. She's determined to expand her effort statewide to find more converts to her cause. ""This is a life-or-death issue,"" she said. ""Obesity affects us all ... and the only way that we're going to combat it is: Stand together."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Records are there to be broken -- but how many more records can one man break? Lionel Messi extended his goalscoring run in La Liga to 18 consecutive matches after scoring twice in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Rayo Vallecano Sunday. Messi, the four-time World Player of the Year, scored an unparalleled 91 goals for club and country in 2012, surpassing the previous record of 85 set by Germany's Gerd Muller in 1972. The 25-year-old, who reportedly earns $14.75 million a year, looked an absolute bargain as he helped Barcelona restore its 13-point cushion at the top of the table. Messi has already scored 55 goals for Barcelona so far this season, 42 of those in La Liga with 13 in other competitions. An incredible 29 goals have come in his past 18 league games -- a streak which has seen any suggestion of a slump consigned to the garbage. Consecutive defeats to arch rival Real Madrid and the Champions League first leg defeat in Milan had left question marks over Barcelona's form. But the 4-0 thrashing of Milan last week proved Barca means business and it could have had five or six against Rayo had it moved out of second gear. With coach Tito Vilanova expected to be back in the dug-out for the next game against Celta Vigo following cancer treatment, Barcelona looks in great shape to wrestle the league title back from Real Madrid. Elsewhere in La Liga, Atletico Madrid kept up the pressure on second place Real with a 2-0 win at Osasuna courtesy of Diego Costa's double. There was a shock defeat for Champions League quarterfinalist Malaga, which was beaten 2-0 at home by Espanyol, while Sevilla strolled to a 4-0 win over Real Zaragoza. David Beckham returned to the scene of his infamous red card in the 1998 World Cup as his Paris Saint-Germain side was held to a 2-2 draw at Saint-Etienne. Beckham was sent off during England's last-16 tie with Argentina after kicking out at Diego Simeone -- an incident which led to him being vilified following the team's exit on penalties. But it was a less eventful evening for Beckham on this occasion, although he did come close to winning the tie late on with one of his trademark free kicks. PSG had moved into a two-goal lead thanks to strikes from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Javier Pastore. But the home side rallied and an own-goal from Alex halved the deficit before Francois Clerc grabbed an equalizer. The result leaves PSG five points clear of nearest challenge Lyon at the top of Ligue 1. In the English Premier League, Chelsea moved into third place following a 2-0 win over West Ham at Stamford Bridge. Frank Lampard's 200th goal for the club and an Eden Hazard effort sealed the points for Rafa Benitez's side. Chelsea's win took it above Tottenham, which suffered an embarrassing 1-0 home defeat by Fulham. Managed by former Spurs boss Martin Jol, it was another former employee who did the damage with Dimitar Berbatov scoring Fulham's winner. Wigan kept its hope of survival alive with a late 2-1 win over Newcastle in a game which was marred by an awful tackle by Callum McManaman on visiting defender Massadio Haidara. Haidara was taken off on a stretcher to hospital with suspected ligament damage, while McManaman escaped any disciplinary action from referee Mark Halsey. ""It is an awful challenge. The pictures speak for themselves,"" Newcastle manager Alan Pardew told reporters. ""I thought it was a bad challenge and I was 60 yards from the incident. The players knew because they were on top of it and there was a lot of bad feeling about that incident when it goes unpunished."" Elsewhere, Norwich was held to a 1-1 draw at Sunderland. In Italy, Edinson Cavani's double took Napoli to within nine points of Serie A leader Juventus. With nine games of the season remaining, Walter Mazzari's side could ill-afford any further slip-ups and had to be at its best to see off Atalanta 3-2. ""I'm happy for Cavani and for (Goran) Pandev after their goals but also for securing the three points,"" Mazzarri told reporters. ""It remained close right up to the end and it was an edgy finish."" Mario Balotelli scored twice in Milan's 2-0 win over Palermo, while Inter's game at Sampdoria was postponed because of heavy snow and rain. Francesco Totti scored his 226th Serie A goal as Roma moved up to sixth after a 2-0 win over Parma. But Lazio suffered a 1-0 defeat in Turin as a late goal by Jonathas secured victory for Torino. In Germany, Eintracht Frankfurt suffered a 2-1 home defeat by Stuttgart, while Borussia Moenchengladbach defeated 10-man Hanover 1-0.","Lionel Messi scores twice in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Rayo Vallecano .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- An avalanche, such as the one that killed at least eight climbers in Nepal this weekend, is known in mountaineering circles as an objective hazard -- a risk that you cannot control and one all climbers must accept. But with Mount Manaslu playing host to some 231 mountaineers from 25 teams this season -- an unusually large number for the world's eighth largest peak -- the natural disaster is likely to revive concerns about whether the Himalayan mountains favored by commercial expeditions are becoming too crowded. The avalanche was triggered by a huge piece of ice that fell from a glacier. It destroyed some 25 tents at one camp and survivors spoke of being swept hundreds of meters down the mountainside. Read More: Search for survivors resumes in Nepal . Manaslu had proved particularly popular this year after Chinese authorities restricted tourist visas, making access to Cho Oyu or Shishapangma, two 8,000m (26,000 ft) peaks on the border with Tibet, difficult, said Grayson Schaffer, senior editor at Outside magazine. ""The devastation of the avalanche was certainly magnified by the number of people that were in its way,"" he told CNN. Ang Tscherting Sherpa, the former head of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, said that avalanches on this scale were relatively rare on Manaslu, which was regarded as one of the easier 8,000m peaks to surmount. He said the accident was not connected to the number of climbers. ""Such avalanches are hard to predict. It all depends on the snow fall and how warm the ground is."" Read more: Avalanche strikes climbers in Nepal . The problem of over-crowding is most stark at Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, which attracts hundreds of climbers each year eager to take a shot at the 8,848m (29,029 ft) summit. In May this year, climbers spoke of ""traffic jams"" as more than 150 climbers waited their turn to summit the mountain during a window of good weather. The consequences were deadly as some climbers' air supplies began to run out and frost bite began to set in. Six climbers died in the space of two days. Leanne Shuttleworth, a British woman who made a successful summit on May 20, said there were bodies attached to fixed lines and she had to walk around them. ""There was a couple who were still alive,"" she told Britain's Daily Mail. ""Our Sherpa helped one of the people but a couple were so far gone they didn't even know we were there. It was the most horrendous thing to see."" A total of 10 climbers died on Everest in April and May, making it the third deadliest spring season on record after 12 people perished in 1996 and 11 in 2006. Schaffer, who spent April and May at Everest base camp, attributes the high death toll to thrill-seeking amateurs, who are actively courted by cut-price outfitters. ""If you really want to climb one of these mountains, you can pay someone to take you regardless of your experience level,"" he said. ""In the past 10 years, it's gone from almost unheard of to happening more often."" Nepal has eight of the 14 highest peaks in the world and tourism is a big earner for the landlocked country's economy. September marks the beginning of the fall climbing season, which runs through November. Unlike the spring season, which comes after a dry winter, the fall season follows the wet monsoon, coating the mountains in a lot more snow. This attracts mountaineer skiers like Glen Plake, who survived Sunday's avalanche. The extreme sports celebrity had planned to ski down the mountain without the aid of oxygen.

"Off the coast of East Africa (CNN) -- On board the HDMS Iver Huitfeldt, the captain has just had them execute what on land would be considered a three point turn. The huge frigate churns up the ocean as it neatly swings back around to its starting point ship and to an abrupt -- and complete -- stop. This is not what you'd expect from a gigantic naval warship, but this is no ordinary boat. The Iver Huitfeldt is one of the most advanced ships in the world. The average ship cruises along at roughly 9 miles an hour. The Iver does 30. With a 46,000 horsepower engine it can get to top speeds from a standing start, outrunning and surrounding its targets in a manner designed to make those on board think twice about putting up too much of a fight. The Iver is at what's been described as the sharp end of Operation Ocean Shield, NATO's counter-piracy mission in the waters off of the Horn of Africa. Commander Carsten Fjord-Larsen, the Iver's skipper, sees his high-tech ship as a very modern solution in the fight against an age-old problem. ""Keeping the pirates at bay, keeping them ashore is the first key issue. We can sit on the pirate camps and prevent them from coming out, and if they go out we disrupt them."" Operation Ocean Shield began life in 2008 as a United Nations-mandated mission to escort World Food Program ships through the Red Sea, one of the busiest waterways in the world. It later evolved into its current iteration, helping to drive down the frequency and success of piracy attacks. But it hasn't been easy, and Fjord-Larsen has a tinge of respect in his voice when he speaks about the pirate's capabilities. ""They have been building up tactical procedures and we have seen that they are fantastic sailors, and now that we can come very close to shore, I've seen with my own eyes how they can negotiate the big waves along the coast."" ""They are well organized and they can easily put up an attack group, with the necessary money to do so and to get the men,"" he added. One of the ways the Iver's technology has helped is by taking much of the guesswork out of a potentially hostile approach. The ship is equipped with an infra-red camera, which has a range of at least seven miles. ""We can see right into the small craft, we can see faces on people,"" said Per Moll, the Iver's executive officer. ""We can see what they have in the craft. Is that fishing gear? We can see ladders, are there a lot of weapons on board?"" ""If we do have a pirated ship and we're doing an approach, trying to free the hostages or at least take back the ship, we can see who's actually in charge because you can follow the different people around the ship."" The Iver Huitfeldt is one of four ships involved in Ocean Shield. The San Marco, an Italian ship, acts as the floating headquarters for the operation and a base for Admiral Antonio Natale, the commander overseeing Ocean Shield. The San Marco hosts joint training exercises to help build the pirate-fighting capacities of regional navies. We watched Tanzanian sailors looking on as the San Marco marine unit rappelled from helicopters suspended over the flight deck. This is what a hostile approach must look like for the hostages on a pirate craft -- goggle-wearing marines in camouflage snaking down suspended ropes before fanning out across the ship with guns cocked as the chopper's blades whip up the air and the sea. At least 212 crew members of various ships were held hostage by pirates off the Horn of Africa in 2012. And while another 60 have been held so far this year, Natale believes Ocean Shield is starting to turn the tide against the seaborne criminal gangs. ""Right now the last hijacked 'unit' was in May last year,"" Natale told us. ""There are some attacks but with no success and we've captured pirates who are in jail awaiting prosecution, so the situation seems to be going in the right direction."" The huge amounts being spent here may be paying off, but piracy still effectively acts as a tax on every good coming through these waters. Many commercial operators now pay on board security contractors, and those that don't must cough up for the extra fuel expended in navigating around the pirates' operating zone, which is an area the size of Europe. Another option is a costly wait to be transported by NATO ships through the so-called ""Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor."" But Admiral Natale is optimistic that through the involvement of regional partners, a sustainable -- not to mention cheaper -- solution can be found. ""Two years ago the international community paid more than $12 billion to face this problem; last year we reduced this amount to $7 billion and only a small part of this is related to governments, to the military."" But Natale is clear that to truly defeat piracy once and for all in the Horn of Africa, the key lies in Somalia. ""We've been successful at sea, but of course the roots of the problem are on land. In the last ten years this has been, we could say, the only 'job' for many young Somalis, the only way for them to work somewhere."" ""Any activity that will help train Somalis in order to stabilize their country will help bring about a final solution."" For now though, the gains made at sea remain reversible. ""As long as we're here we're putting on a strong pressure, and it would be naÃ¯ve to think that if we leave that all would stay peaceful"" Captain Fjord-Larsen said. ""That's not the case. The funding [for pirates] is there and they would be able to launch pirate attack groups very shortly.""","NATO's Operation Ocean Shield chases pirates off Horn of Africa .

"New York (CNN) --   A former college professor in upstate New York says  he was fired and discriminated against because he is straight. Dr. Csaba Marosan taught natural Sciences at Trocaire College in Buffalo. He told CNN that he was asked not to return this year because of his formal complaint against the college in 2009. Marosan alleges that college officials gave preferential treatment to gay faculty members in a  small clique dubbed, ""the Merry Men."" The college denied the allegations and attributes his dismissal to  lack of qualifications. The former professor said he has taught at the college for  eight years. ""Trocaire is confident that it will be vindicated when the full facts of  this case are presented in the hearing process,"" said John A. Vecchio, vice president for institutional advancement. A report from the New York State Division of Human Rights shows that a dean of education allegedly made comments about Marosan's nationality, accent, culture and manner of greeting colleagues. The initial report was amended in April to include the differential treatment Marosan allegedly received since the investigation started, including his eventual dismissal. The amended report also includes a charge of discrimination based on sexual orientation, which Marosan said he initially left out. ""I am not a homophobe, and I did not want to bring up sexual orientation going into it,"" he said. Vecchio criticized the rights' group probe. ""The decision of the New York Division of Human Rights is based on a poor and incomplete investigation,"" he said. In addition, the report indicates that among a number of sexual harassment complaints made against Marosan, at least one student admitted to having been coached. All other cases were fully dismissed.","Dr. Csaba Marosan taught natural Sciences in upstate New York .

"(CNN) -- The changing black and white MRI images resembled a Rorschach test. Somewhere in these patterns was the story of my pain. I knew there was something wrong with my shoulders because it felt as if my arms were attached by rusty nails. Looking at the scans, the surgeon made it clear: I needed surgery in both shoulders. I couldn't accept this reality. These surgeries aren't just a giant setback for my career as an acrobat, they could pose a threat to my sobriety. I am a recovering heroin addict who cannot take opiate painkillers. I have witnessed many recovering addicts relapse after surgery. I've traveled this path myself after a few terrible root canals from another medical experience, and came crawling back to heroin. I've learned not to take any risks. How can I wager my recovery on the scales of justice? On one side sits surgery with the possibility of relapse. On the other sits an injured body in pain. How could I bargain the one element that has given me a beautiful and free life? Addict goes under the knife . My first fear revolves around the actual pain itself. Narcotic painkillers are the number one prescribed medication after surgery because painkillers kill pain. During my active addiction, I lived many years with the ability to eradicate pain at my own whim by simply pushing the end of a syringe. Now, in recovery, I must bow down and surrender to it. Is there a difference between eradicating pain and pain management? Do all opiate addicts have to suffer through physical painful situations? I've played this scenario out many times. I am prescribed narcotic painkillers after surgery, while holding on to the absolute perspective that no matter what, after six years of sobriety, I WILL NOT RETURN TO THE MADNESS OF ADDICTION. Depending on strength and dosage, I'm instructed to take one to two pills every four to six hours. It takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of the first pill. Can 20 minutes destroy a lifetime achievement? As the pill dissolves, the thought slowly waltzes in, as it did in my past. To the outsider, I would appear fine, maybe a little drowsy. But the imperceptible secret would live behind the thick fog of my thoughts. Nobody can see the addiction's contemplation: ""This feels good. ... Oh God, I remember this."" As the disease melodically whispers -- as if six years of sobriety never passed -- I cling to the memories of my lifelong struggle with heroin and remember I'VE GOT TO STAY SOBER AT ALL COSTS! The secret grows, traveling back to memories of my most powerful highs, wrapping its venomous arms into my mundane reality. ""Joey, you are in pain. It's OK. It's too much pain. Maybe you should take two pills (as prescribed),"" it says. Two pills seems reasonable, but four to six hours is just too long because the pain seems to be returning quicker. Maybe an extra pill wouldn't hurt, I think, eventually cutting back the indicated time by an hour. In the final stage of my imagined scenario, the addiction begins to caress my insecurities. Perfectionism is my great destructor. I'm terrified of making mistakes or being imperfect because I don't want to be judged or laughed at (like so many of us). Drugs quiet this enormous desire to be perfect. The power of these opiates temporarily relieves these stresses, and I find solace in the darkness once again. Now that the secret is alive and thriving, I go straight to heroin, as the most effective and seductive drug I've ever known. Surgery and sobriety is a controversial topic, even among those in recovery. It's such a gray area because nobody really knows how to treat such a delicate situation. I think it would be helpful to combine Eastern and Western medicines, to find some concrete solutions to pain management. Medication in combination with techniques such as acupuncture or frequency specific aricular therapy. It's not only the recovering addict who is at risk, but others who can end up addicted to narcotic pain medication. Many years ago, I was in rehab with another patient who was also being treated for opiate addiction. He had cancer and was in a lot of physical pain.

"(CNN) -- When Hurricane Irene hit, 11-year-old Zahir Robinson and his mother took shelter on a bed in the upstairs bedroom of their apartment in Newport News, Virginia. Just after noon on Saturday, an ""extremely large tree"" toppled by the high winds smashed into the room and pinned the youth beneath it, according to local police. Despite frantic efforts to remove the tree, including the use of a large crane to lift it, the boy died -- one of 15 fatalities in six states so far from the storm. Eight of the deaths involved falling trees or limbs broken off in the hurricane. While the prospect of toppled trees and crashing limbs is easy to imagine, planning against such a threat is difficult. In North Carolina, three of the six known deaths were tree-related, while the lone death reported in Maryland involved a tree falling on a house and all four deaths in Virginia -- including Robinson's -- were caused by overturned trees. ""I am saddened to learn of this unfortunate tragedy,"" Newport News Mayor McKinley Price said of Robinson's death. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to the family of this young child. I urge our residents to take all precautions necessary to remain safe during and after this storm."" Falling trees or limbs snapped off in high winds pose a particularly difficult threat to avoid. The size and weight of a toppled tree, which can exceed 10,000 pounds, make it an unstoppable force, while the random nature of falling tree limbs pose an unpredictable danger. When Hurricane Fran hit North Carolina in 1996, half the 24 deaths there involved falling trees or limbs, according to information posted online by the Renaissance Computing Institute at East Carolina University. ""Before hurricane season, assess your property to ensure that landscaping and trees do not become a wind hazard,"" the National Hurricane Center warns on its website. ""Trim dead wood and weak / overhanging branches from all trees. Certain trees and bushes are vulnerable to high winds and any dead tree near a home is a hazard.""

"(CNN) -- The world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, has escaped serious injury in a car crash in his native Jamaica which wrecked his high-speed sports car. Jamaican flyer Bolt claimed 100 meters gold in Beijing in a new world record time. The IAAF, the world governing body of athletics, gave graphic details of Bolt's lucky escape on its official Web site www.iaaf.org. The 22-year-old, who was driving his BMW M3 with two female passengers, lost control and went off a rain-soaked road. The car ended up overturned in a ditch and Bolt and his passengers had to clamber out through a bed of thorns before being taken to hospital in Spanish Town, near Kingston, as a precaution. Bolt was released after three hours, with his feet strapped with bandages, after undergoing a minor operation to remove embedded thorns from his foot. He told a local reporter: ""Me good man. Me all right, a just few cuts man, me all right."" As a result of the accident, Bolt will miss Saturday's Jamaica International Invitational meeting and is expected to be sidelined for at least a week. ""We will continue to monitor his progress over the next few days,"" Bolt's agent Ricky Simms told reporters. ""It's too early to say if this will have any impact on his training and racing program in the next few weeks."" Bolt is also set to come to England in mid-May to run in a special 150 meters street race in Manchester. A spokesman for the organizers told CNN that they were hopeful the sprint sensation would be fit to turn up. ""We are in constant contact with his management team and everything remains on track for him to come,"" said Norman Hart. Bolt set world records in winning the 100 and 200 meters gold in the Beijing OIympics and claimed a third gold as Jamaica took the 4x100 meters relay. He was given the BMW by his sponsors as reward for his incredible success which catapulted him to global stardom.","Sprinter Usain Bolt fortunate to escape from car crash in his native Jamaica .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster a year ago, the attitude toward food safety has become a matter of personal preference for many Tokyo residents. After an earthquake-triggered tsunami engulfed the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant in northeastern Japan, setting off the most serious radiation scare since the 1986 Chernobyl accident, Japan is still struggling to build a centralized radiation-detection system, leading to difficulty in measuring radiation and ambiguous safety guidelines. For some consumers, this means checking for food labels that indicate food is safe. Others still avoid certain fish or agricultural products from northern Japan. Some residents still take food to radiation monitoring stations to ensure safety. But many consumers have gone back to eating much like they were before the disaster. Yusuke Okuno, a 22-year-old service-industry worker, employed a cautious approach to radiation exposure immediately following the disaster. ""I tried not to get wet when it rained, and when I bought vegetables, I always made sure of where they came from,"" he says. These days he doesn't pay that much attention. ""It's been some time,"" he says. ""I don't see much point in doing it now."" For the owner of the 60-year-old shop and wedding catering business Takasagoya at the Tsukiji Fish Market, the concern is business not health. ""One of the food products I sell is yakidai (grilled snapper), fish used for special occasions like weddings,"" he said. ""There were many requests made by my clients not to use the fish from eastern Japan."" In response to food-safety concerns, the government has been stepping up efforts to assure people of the safety of Japan's agricultural products. Radiation monitoring centers have been set up in certain prefectures to identify and restrict the consumption of contaminated foods. But getting yes-or-no answers is not easy. ""Absolute values are very hard to measure,"" says Pieter Franken, director of Japan Operations at Safecast, a non-profit organization that collects and shares radiation measurements. ""You have to decide for yourself, what do I believe and what don't I believe."" ""For many people it's very confusing,"" says Franken. ""There are more questions than answers to this thing."" Japanese exports dropped sharply in the months after the March 11 disaster amid global concerns about radiation in its food products. Fuji Apple exports to Taiwan dropped from nearly 1,400 tons to zero in a matter of two months. Authorities have gone to great lengths to point out that the country's food products are safe. Government press releases report that no Japanese exports have failed radiation screening by any importing countries, and that cities like Hong Kong and New York are in fact more radioactive than Tokyo. Tourism also plummeted 70% on radiation fears immediately following the disaster. Tourism is still below year-ago levels, but the 700,000 tourists that arrived in January represented only a 4.5% decrease from the same month in 2011, the Japan Tourism Agency said in February. The government has picked the anniversary of the disaster to unveil its new ""Japan. Thank You."" campaign to give an added boost to a tourism industry still in recovery. Some tourists, like New York University law student Gene Levin, haven't given much thought to possible radiation contamination. Levin says he doesn't mind eating food that others shun, ""because it will be delicious and cheap."" But for many Tokyo residents, the concern is still strong enough that they take their food to radiation-measuring stations set up around Tokyo. However, checking food for radiation is not cheap. ""We have around five to seven customers a day come and check their food for a fee of Â¥3,500 ($42),"" says Hidetake Ishimaru, a member of Measuring Stations for Children of the Future, a non-profit organization that sets up stations around Tokyo to test for radiation in food. ""They will ask many questions like, 'is it okay to eat this one?'"" He acknowledges that it is not an exact science. ""We cannot answer clearly."" Safecast's Franken agrees. ""The government has made specific recommendations, but people don't really know what to do with those, they want a second opinion,"" he says. Franken, who has a nine-year-old child, says his wife takes location into account when buying food for the family, purchasing products from the south of Japan in general, and mineral water from France. ""You can debate if it's logical or not, but that's what we do,"" he says. The owner of Takasagoya thinks it's time to stop worrying. ""The government has been testing the food,"" he says, and he thinks it's safe. As for himself, ""I am very old. Unlike young people, I have fewer things to worry about."" Okuno, the 22-year-old service-industry worker who used to check the origin of his vegetables, has also moved on. ""You cannot live forever in fear,"" he says. As he lines up outside a sushi restaurant at the Tsukiji Fish Market with his girlfriend, Yoko Senuma, a student who turns 20 on March 11, it isn't the anniversary of the disaster that is foremost on his mind. It's treating his girlfriend to a birthday meal of sushi. ""She wanted good food. So I decided to take her here.""","Japan still hasn't built a central radiation detection system after the nuclear disaster .

"(CNN) -- Friends of a 22-year-old Kentucky soldier suspected of spying expressed shock Wednesday, describing him instead as a patriotic and simple country boy dedicated to his job. Spc. William Colton Millay of Owensboro, Kentucky, was arrested Friday at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, according to Col. Bill Coppernoll, the public affairs officer at the base. The Army did not disclose the circumstances surrounding Millay's arrest but his name immediately appeared online in conjunction with Bradley Manning, the Army private suspected of leaking classified information to the website WikiLeaks. But FBI spokesman Eric Gonzalez said Millay's arrest had no connection to WikiLeaks. Nor did it involve any transfer of information, Coppernoll said. ""While we can't go into any specifics, this is completely different than the Manning case in that it does not involve the transfer of data on computer networks,"" he said. Coppernoll said any information that might have been transferred was stopped and that ""Millay was being observed well before any damage could have occurred."" Millay was hardly fitting of a spy persona, said longtime friend Drew Bramschreiber of Owensboro. ""He's just a simple country boy,"" he said. ""He was never the kind of guy who would get into trouble."" Millay was not even that computer-savvy, Bramschreiber said. Millay was assigned to the 164th Military Police Company, 793rd Military Police Battalion, 2nd Engineer Brigade, known as the ""Arctic Enforcers."" The unit was sent earlier this year to Afghanistan. But Millay was part of the rear detachment and did not deploy, though his friends said he had done a tour the year before. Millay had been under investigation by the FBI and Army counterintelligence agents, Coppernoll said, and will face military charges sometime this week. CNN tried to contact Millay's family Wednesday. A man who answered a telephone call placed to his family's home in Owensboro said, ""No comment,"" and hung up. But his friends could not believe the news. ""You've got the wrong guy,"" said Janssen Payne. ""That's just not who he is."" Payne, who now lives in Phoenix, Arizona, said Millay idolized his brother, who is also in the Army, and that he had been in the ROTC program in high school. He was a supporter of George W. Bush and the U.S. war effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, his friend said. There wasn't much to do in Owensboro so Millay and his high school buddies hung out at the mall or at Walmart, Payne said. They were cut-ups, making YouTube videos that spoofed Bruce Willis in the ""Die Hard"" movies. But Millay dreamed of joining the Army and in 2007, he enlisted. One summer day, while on leave from Afghanistan, he showed up at Bramschreiber's house in Owensboro. They drank a couple of beers and talked. Millay told him that it was hard being on edge all the time. But he wasn't different at all, Bramschreiber said. ""I suppose anybody can get messed up with the wrong crowd,"" he said. ""Colton could've done that but he's a smart guy."" Janssen said the only way Millay would do something illegal would be if he thought he were protecting someone who had been wronged. But without any details yet of why the Army suspected Millay, it was difficult for Janssen to fathom that his friend might be in trouble. Millay was in custody Wednesday at the Anchorage Correctional Complex. His arrest ""was the result of the close working relationship between the FBI and its military partners in Alaska,"" said Mary Frances Rook, the special agent in charge of the FBI in Alaska. ""Through this ongoing partnership, we are better able to protect our nation.""

"London (CNN) -- Investigators have found no sign of foul play in the death of a man identified as the whistleblower behind the scandal surrounding media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News International, British police announced Tuesday. Sean Hoare was one of the first journalists to go on the record and allege phone hacking at Murdoch's now-defunct News of the World. He was found dead Monday at his home in Watford, northwest of London, the British Press Association said. An autopsy conducted Tuesday afternoon ""has concluded there is no evidence of third-party involvement and the death is non-suspicious,"" Hertfordshire police said in a statement. Earlier, police had called his death ""unexplained, but not thought to be suspicious."" Hoare had publicly accused News of the World of phone-hacking and using ""pinging"" -- a method of tracking someone's cell phone using technology that only police and security officials could access -- according to the New York Times. He was one of the few sources who allowed his name to be used when speaking to the Times last year for an investigative report about allegations of phone-hacking by the British tabloid, which was shuttered last weekend as the scandal grew. The rapidly metastasizing scandal has led to the resignations of several of Murdoch's top lieutenants and of the two top officials of London's Metropolitan Police, whose officers were accused of taking payments from journalists in exchange for confidential information. The scandal has led to 10 arrests, including those of two former News of the World editors, Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks. Brooks' arrest came two days after her resignation as head of News International, the British subsidiary of Murdoch's global conglomerate News Corp., while Coulson had gone on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director. Hoare specifically accused Coulson of wrongdoing, saying Coulson ""encouraged"" phone-hacking."" Coulson resigned his Downing Street post in January when police launched a new probe into the hacking allegations. The Times described Hoare has a ""onetime close friend of Coulson's."" The report added that Hoare said he was ""fired during a period when he was struggling with drugs and alcohol. He said he was now revealing his own use of the dark arts -- which included breaking into the messages of celebrities like David and Victoria Beckham -- because it was unfair for the paper to pin the blame solely on"" one reporter who covered the royal family. Hoare ""repeatedly expressed the hope that the hacking scandal would lead to journalism in general being cleaned up and said he had decided to blow the whistle on the activities of some of his former News of the World colleagues with that aim in mind,"" Britain's The Guardian newspaper reported Monday. His allegations ultimately led to Tuesday's testimony by Murdoch to a House of Commons committee, where he denied ultimate responsibility for illegal phone hacking carried out by his employees. ""I feel that the people I trusted, I don't know at what level, let me down and I think they behaved disgracefully, betrayed the company and me, and it's for them to pay,"" he said. ""I think that frankly I'm the best person to clear this up.""","NEW: Sean Hoare's death was declared ""non-suspicious"" after an autopsy .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Global warming concerns took center stage Monday as two organizations held rallies to draw attention to an issue that President Barack Obama has promised to place near the top of his agenda. Demonstrators stand outside the Capitol Power Plant in Washington on Monday to protest the plant's use of coal. A group of young protesters gathered in front of the Capitol to rally on behalf of legislation to reduce carbon emissions, decrease dependence on coal and oil, and speed a national drive toward ""clean"" energy. Later Monday, hundreds of representatives of a coalition of environmental, public health, social justice and other advocacy organizations marched around Capitol Hill and encircled a Washington coal-fired power plant to highlight the issue of climate change. The group, protesting the Capitol Power Plant's use of coal, stood in front of the plant's gated entrances. The plant powers the heating and cooling systems in the Capitol, as well as roughly a dozen other federal office buildings on Capitol Hill. ""The Capitol Power Plant, sitting just blocks from Capitol Hill, symbolizes the stranglehold coal has over our government and future,"" the group said on its Web site. ""It's not the largest or the dirtiest power plant in the country, but as the plant that is actually run by and for Congress it serves as an incredibly iconic symbol of what is wrong with our country's energy and climate policy."" No arrests were made as a result of the protest, which ""didn't affect the operations of the power plant,"" Capitol police Sgt. Kimberly Schneider said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released a letter Thursday calling for the plant to convert to 100 percent natural gas by the end of 2009. ""Taking this major step toward cleaning up the Capitol Power Plant's emissions would be an important demonstration of Congress' willingness to deal with the enormous challenges of global warming, energy independence and our inefficient use of finite fossil fuels,"" they wrote. Several members of Congress and environmental leaders addressed the earlier rally, which was held at the conclusion to Power Shift '09, a four-day environmental summit organized by the Energy Action Coalition. The coalition describes itself as an umbrella organization of 700 groups fighting for ""clean energy solutions and the creation of a new green economy."" It's time to ""turn up the political heat in Washington so we can turn down the heat on Mother Earth,"" Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told the crowd. ""The science tells us that the time for talking about this problem is over. The time for action is now."" The concept of ""clean coal"" is a ""dirty lie,"" added environmental activist Robert F. Kennedy. ""The most important thing you can do is not to change your light bulb but to change [members of Congress who have been] corrupted by ... dirty, filthy industry."" America needs to be freed from the ""carbon cronies,"" who are part of the ""biggest threat to civilization,"" Kennedy said.","Two protests on global warming issues hit Washington .

"(CNN) -- A few weeks ago, Time Magazine ran its now-famous cover: ""The Republican Savior: How Marco Rubio became the new voice of the GOP."" Only time will tell if the junior senator from Florida lives up to that billing, and it's entirely possible that Time will be proven wrong in the coming months and years. But there's one cover that the magazine could run now and be entirely confident in: ""The Republican Messenger: How Rand Paul became the real voice of the GOP."" That's right. At least for the time being, tea party darling Sen. Rand Paul is the effective leader of the Republican Party. And that's a pretty big deal. The GOP's shellacking in 2012 has thrust a new generation of Republicans -- including leaders like Rubio, Rep. Paul Ryan, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Govs. Bobby Jindal and Chris Christie -- into the spotlight. But it's Paul who has become the clearest voice of the new guard in the Republican Party. And he is effectively driving the entire GOP message right now. Think about it. No one else in the GOP has been able to step into a real leadership position, no matter how hard they try. Paul Ryan? He's back in the halls of Congress trying to figure out how to repackage his failed fiscal approach. John Boehner and Eric Cantor? Congressional Republicans have an approval rating in the low teens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham? Each day they seem less like elder statesmen and more like Statler and Waldorf from the ""Muppet Show."" Chris Christie? He may be the nation's most popular governor, but conservative groups find Sarah Palin and Donald Trump more compelling these days. Bob McDonnell? He's already got a conservative SuperPAC running ads against him in Iowa! Jeb Bush? His reentry to the national political dialogue this week was clumsy at best. Paul is the only guy who appears able at this point to step into the GOP leadership void. There are two reasons why. First, Paul has proven that he has the ability to punch his message through in a way that no one else in the Republican Party can. He's clear. Whether or not you agree with him (and I rarely do), you know where he stands. He articulates his message more clearly than most people in Washington. He's principled. He's more ideologically consistent than many people in Washington (though admittedly, that's not the highest of bars these days). He's willing to take on leaders of both parties to make a point. While many senators in his party have held up nominations for petty political reasons, Paul held up John Brennan's nomination over a principled stand that attracted attention from both progressives and conservatives. And as several commentators said after the fact, it's easy to believe that he would have done the same under a Republican president. Paul's also proven to be a master of both old and new media. Just look at this week. He had the entire traditional political press corps and mainstream media focused on him like a laser beam by utilizing one of the most old school tools available to a senator -- the filibuster. Yet he made it feel new. For weeks, the press had been reporting on the use of silent filibusters to hold up nominations and on the attempts at filibuster reform. So Paul, by forsaking a tool that so many of his colleagues seem to love, and understanding how to capitalize on an existing media narrative, came across looking courageous and principled and dominated the news cycle for 24 hours. But what made the move truly genius, was that he launched it through Twitter. And as fellow tea party Sen. Ted Cruz stated later on the Senate floor, the twitterverse blew up -- further driving the message in both old and new media. Compare that to Marco Rubio's response to the State of the Union Address. For all of the hype that led up to his speech, what will people truly remember? That he stopped in the middle to take a drink of water, and that he gave a version in Spanish. That's pretty much it. In the breathless rush to rebrand the GOP by party leaders, that second point was heralded as a major success. But as to the ability to punch through an actual message, Rand Paul is running circles around everyone else. The second reason why Paul has become the party's most effective messenger is that everyone across the entire ideological spectrum -- from John McCain, Rubio and The Wall Street Journal to Majority Leader Harry Reid and Attorney General Eric Holder -- is responding to him. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz rushed to floor to bask in the glory of Paul's ""filiblizzard."" Attorney General Holder sent him a letter clarifying the administration's position on drones. Reid and Minority Leader McConnell took to the Senate floor to applaud Paul's conviction (and bladder control). It wasn't all love, however. Fellow Republican Sens. McCain and Graham took to the floor to blast him for his position. The problem is that they are decidedly old guard. The new faces in the party fell all over themselves to ""#standwithrand."" Rand Paul has people listening and responding to him. He's dictating the conversation. And when you look at the ineptitude of the rest of the Republican message machine, it's pretty clear that he is one of the few people in his party that know how to do that. Van Jones: Rand Paul, a civil liberties hero and civil rights villain . Now, that doesn't mean Paul doesn't have serious problems. On most issues, he is seriously outside of the mainstream. He often gets his facts dangerously wrong -- like when he falsely argued that the number of government employees grew under President Obama, or when he alleged that the U.S. was smuggling weapons out of Libya to Turkey, without any proof. And at a time when most Americans are starving for leaders willing to cross party lines and find common ground, he is about as far from compromise as you can get. It's that last point that may be why Paul is so dangerous to the Republican Party moving forward. Paul said this week that he is seriously considering a run for President in 2016. The more he steps in to fill the GOP's gaping leadership vacuum, the more others -- and particularly other potential 2016 presidential candidates -- will chase him. That means Republican leaders run the risk of seeming even more strident, more intolerant, more uncompromising, and more outside the mainstream than they did in 2012. Those, like Christie, that buck this trend run the risk of being ostracized by the conservative grassroots -- something that not a lot of potential Republican 2016ers have shown much interest in doing. Even if Paul doesn't become the nominee, he has the potential to shape the GOP field in a way that few others can at this point. In short, for now, it's Rand Paul's party. And it seems like so many other Republicans are simply trying to figure out how to live in it. (Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the number of federal employees had not grown under President Obama; in fact, the total number of government employees at all levels has not grown since he took office.) The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mo Elleithee.","Mo Elleithee says the week highlighted split in the GOP .

"(CNN) -- As the nation faces a looming retirement crisis, a member of Congress has proposed a terrible idea that would bash seniors. Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier of California asked the National Park Service to consider raising the price of the senior lifetime pass to help solve the parks' $153 million budget gap caused by the sequester cuts. Pause for a moment and consider that $153 million is a tiny portion of the federal budget. It is a little more than the value of Bill Gates' house and a fraction of the price of a B-2 bomber. People over 62 can buy a $10 lifetime pass to the more than 2000 federal recreational sites. For volunteers, the disabled and young children, it's free. With the exception of a few other cases, it's $80 for an annual pass to all the sites. If the park service doubled the cost of the senior lifetime pass, it would raise $5 million. That's such a tiny drop in the bucket it's laughable. This is not about the $5 million. Raising the lifetime park pass for seniors is not offered up to lower park admission prices for young people. In other words, there is no fixed pie. If grandma gets more, then baby Charlie gets less. No. Unlike reptiles, human societies do not arrange to eat their young. There is a sincere but mistaken belief out there that the old are taking advantage of the young. Societies that pay for the old can pay for the young, too. It's not a zero-sum game. My colleagues and I have analyzed the national budgets in more than 63 nations. When a society spends more money on the elderly, they also spend more money on education and other programs benefiting the young. For example, in the United States in the 1970s, education spending tripled, education attainment rates soared and Social Security and Medicare expanded. The park pass proposal comes across as another attempt to erode the financial situation of American seniors who are already facing threats in their coming old age. The various proposals floating around to cut Social Security are scary enough for older Americans. For example, one idea from the Simpson-Bowles Commission is to raise the age seniors can collect their full Social Security benefits from 67 to 70 and the eligibility age from 62 to 65. President Obama has proposed replacing the regular consumer price index, or CPI, to adjust Social Security benefits with the chained CPI -- often called the cat food CPI because the index assumes that when the price of human food rises, seniors can substitute cheaper food to get the same nutrition. A chained CPI would lower lifetime benefits to the oldest seniors by more than $25,000. With the U.S. economy growing at a sluggish pace, older Americans who are nearing retirement face more uncertainty. In 2012, a report from the Government Accountability Office found employers are reluctant to hire older workers, citing reasons such as outdated skills as one of the factors. Workers who are 55 years old and up who lose their jobs have it the hardest. They face the longest period of unemployment. Members of Congress who want generational fairness and balanced budgets won't get there by whacking the elderly with Social Security cuts or higher park pass prices. Why can't Congress be smarter about finding ways to revitalize the economy and create jobs? That is a rhetorical question. They are busy finding coins in the sofa cushions instead of creating a sustainable and stabilizing federal budget. Raising the price of park passes for the elderly won't make a real dent or help young people enjoy the trees more. With this budget process, fewer and fewer families or the elderly will be able to get to the park if they're busy scrambling to get by. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Teresa Ghilarducci.","A congresswoman proposes raising the price of the senior lifetime pass to national parks .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- It's a well known part of Hong Kong urban lore that an apartment where a violent death took place can often be bought for as much as 10-30 per cent off the market price. Depending on the type of death -- suicide, natural death or gruesome murder -- the house will become more or less hongza; a Cantonese term that literally translates as ""calamity house"" but effectively means the house is haunted. Less well known is that secretive databases that collate hongza addresses are playing on local superstitions to effectively control prices in one of the world's most expensive real estate markets. The problem with hongza is that it spreads. Not only will a violent murder affect the price of the apartment where it took place, it will likely slash thousands off neighboring apartments -- and even the whole building. ""Databases don't specify which apartments, data is incomplete: if an apartment has 30 or 40 storeys there's a high probability all will be affected,"" said Jacklyn Pun Ka-Yan, sales director at Many Wells Property Agent. Published information might specify the floor, but not the apartment where the death occurred. In some cases, only the building's address appears. ""I think they should make it clear, they should not just state the entire floor as haunted,"" Patrick Fong, whose flat is listed on the same floor as a hongza apartment, told CNN. Penthouse slums highlight Hong Kong's wealth divide . Once a property is listed on a database, however, there's no way out, says Pun. Owners have little recourse in getting their properties removed from hongza lists. Meanwhile, the more than 5,000 real estate practitioners in the city, according to figures from the Society of Hong Kong Real Estate Agents, are bound to keep tabs on hongza properties following a 2004 court decision making it compulsory for estate agents to report houses with a dark history. The case found against Centaline Property, one of Hong Kong's best-known real estate agencies, after a buyer pulled out of a transaction in 2001 when he discovered the apartment he planned to buy was hongza. ""If an estate agent acting for a purchaser knows, or ought to have known of the occurrence of a tragic incident in a property, and knew or ought reasonably to have known that this would materially affect the value of the property, that agent would owe a duty to alert its client to that fact,"" Judge Benjamin Yu said in the judgment which also acknowledged that property values could be reduced 'between 25 to 30%' in the case of a murder or suicide in a flat. The agency was ordered to pay almost $40,000 as a result of failing to ""obtain information in relation to the properties,"" Judge Yu wrote in his decision. This information is now supplied by unaccountable databases that have no oversight into how the lists are compiled. Repeated attempts by CNN to reach the most widely used information website, hk-compass.com, were unsuccessful. The page does not display the names of its managers. Hong Kong's hot market in 'haunted' houses . Its contacts are listed behind Web Commerce Communications Limited with phone numbers under a Malaysian country code. WCC supplies an identification service, but does not run the website, one of its employees told CNN in a phone interview. Website hk-compass.com sells hongza data to realtors for about $42 a year, according to the price list on the site. ""We can only report the case to the authorities, we can't do anything because we don't know who is behind this,"" said Diamond Shea Hing-wan, President of the Hong Kong Owners' Club. Meanwhile, Shea says, authorities have shown little enthusiasm for tackling a problem that is costing Hong Kong homeowners millions of dollars. ""We have contacted the Estate Agents Authority, but there's no action,"" Shea said, adding that he could only urge property owners to contact Shek Lai-him, a Hong Kong lawmaker who represents realtors on Hong Kong's professional constituency government. Repeated interview requests with Shek were ignored and attempts to speak with the Transport and Housing Department were declined. For one disgruntled property owner, who asked to only be identified as Mr Chan due to the stigma associated with owning a cursed home, the solution to the problem is simple. ""I think the government could regulate the website so that the addresses on it are more detailed,"" he said. Squarefoot, another hongza database, had 3438 entries in their database, as of October 2012, the company told CNN. In some cases, only street addresses are listed, information that could effectively depreciate the value of whole buildings. The final number of property owners affected by a hongza listing is impossible to estimate and, with huge fortunes won or lost in one of the region's most volatile property markets, few want to talk about it. ""The government will try not to do something they don't think they can handle right now,"" said Eddie Hui, Professor at the Department of Building and Real Estate of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Eudora Wong and Sergio Held contributed to this report .","In Hong Kong, an apartment where a violent death has occurred can take 10-30 per cent off its market price .

"(CNN) -- The Capitol Hill hearing on the IRS scandal this week upstaged another Senate investigation into how U.S. technology companies shelter earnings from domestic taxes. That was just as well, since the real culprit here isn't tax-dodging corporations; it's America's absurd corporate tax code. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations had hoped to make a media splash by landing a big fish rarely seen in Washington: Apple CEO Tim Cook. It released a 40-page report on the eve of the hearing, excoriating Apple's use of ""gimmicks"" to avoid paying U.S. taxes on $44 billion in offshore income between 2009 and 2012. Chaired by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, the subcommittee has been investigating the tax avoidance strategies of major U.S. tech firms. Last year, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard were in the dock; Tuesday, it was Apple's turn. ""Apple wasn't satisfied with shifting its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven,"" Levin told the New York Times. ""It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars while claiming to be tax resident nowhere."" At issue are foreign subsidiaries that U.S. multinationals use to manage their overseas operations. The subcommittee report says that tech companies can shuffle their intellectual property as well as earnings among such entities to shield them from America's steep corporate tax rates. Cook, however, denied that Apple funnels any of its U.S. profits into offshore tax havens. The company has amassed more than $100 billion in foreign earnings, he said, because international sales of iPhones and other products account for 61% of its revenues. Apple pays taxes in the countries where its products are sold, he told the panel, adding that it is probably also America's largest corporate taxpayer, with expected 2013 liabilities of $7 billion. The Senate inquisitors aren't accusing the tech companies of doing anything illegal but of cleverly exploiting loopholes in U.S. tax laws that allow them to shelter income overseas. Lawmakers want the firms to ""repatriate"" their overseas profits so that they can be taxed here. But the companies say that would be tantamount to taxing them twice, putting them at a disadvantage with foreign competitors who pay taxes only where their products are sold. At a time when America urgently needs to rebuild its revenue base and continue unwinding its public debts, it's little wonder that lawmakers cast a covetous eye on the overseas profits of U.S. firms. But while grilling CEOs may make for good political theater, it doesn't get to the heart of the problem: America's outdated and dysfunctional corporate tax code. How flawed is it? Let us count the ways. First, it subjects U.S.-based corporations to a top marginal rate of 35%, among the highest in the world. Designed at a time when U.S. companies competed mainly with each other, the code now hobbles them in global competition. Second, the code is riddled with special tax deductions, credits and exemptions, which make it both fiendishly complicated and economically inefficient. As economist Robert Shapiro noted in a recent Progressive Policy Institute study, these provisions entail significant administrative and compliance costs and, more damagingly from the standpoint of economic growth, undercut markets' ability to allocate capital to its most productive uses. They also make the code highly inequitable as some companies get breaks while others don't with little rhyme or reason other than how effective their lobbyists are. Third, the United States is one of the few remaining countries (PDF) that has a ""worldwide"" tax system, meaning that we apply the 35% top rate to the worldwide profits of U.S-based companies: that is, on the profits made by foreign subsidiaries as well. Almost every other major economy has a territorial tax system, which taxes only the business profits earned in that country. While U.S. companies get a credit for the taxes they pay overseas, they are still liable for the difference between what they pay abroad and the higher U.S. marginal tax rate. These glaring defects have engendered a rare bipartisan consensus in Washington for sweeping reform of the corporate tax code. The basic idea, endorsed by the Obama administration and House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, is to radically simplify the code by phasing out special preferences and using some or all of the revenues to cut the tax rate. (Progress toward reform is snagged, however, on a dispute over whether any of those revenues should be used for deficit reduction.) More controversial is adopting a territorial system. Some progressives are leery of this approach, since it would put the foreign earnings of U.S.-based companies forever beyond Washington's reach. But as Progressive Policy Institute economist Michael Mandel notes, those foreign profits are already taxed by the countries in which the money is earned. In today's increasingly globalized economy, it makes sense to move toward a simpler system that is easier to enforce. Unlike Apple, U.S. lawmakers have the power to fix our broken corporate tax system. That's probably a better use of their time than villainizing America's most innovative and successful companies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Will Marshall.","Congressional committee strongly criticized Apple's handling of taxes .
Will Marshall: Don't make Apple the scapegoat for a flawed corporate tax code .
He says corporations face world's highest rate and a dysfunctional system .

"(CNN) -- By a narrow margin of about 4,300 votes, Arizona voters approved a ballot measure that would legalize medical marijuana, state election officials said Sunday. With all precincts reporting, the ""yes"" votes on Proposition 203 have 50.1 percent of the vote to 49.8 percent of ""no"" votes, according to unofficial results posted on the Arizona Secretary of State's website. More than 1.6 million votes were cast. Officials in Maricopa County, where the city of Phoenix is located, posted their final update to the unofficial results from the November 2 election on Saturday. At the time, authorities said the race was too close to call. The Marijuana Policy Project, in a statement, heralded the vote, saying it will allow patients who suffer from cancer, AIDS and other illnesses to use medical marijuana with a recommendation from their doctor. ""Voters in Arizona have sided with science and compassion while dealing yet another blow to our nation's cruel and irrational prohibition on marijuana,"" said Rob Kampia, Marijuana Policy Project executive director, in the statement. ""Arizona's law now reflects the mainstream public opinion that seriously ill people should not be treated like criminals if marijuana can provide them relief, and that doctors should be able to recommend marijuana to patients if they believe it can help alleviate their suffering."" The Marijuana Policy Project provided funding and support to the Arizona Medical Marijuana Policy Project, the group that ran the Proposition 203 campaign, the group said. The national organization bills itself as the United States' largest marijuana policy reform organization, and says on its website it would like to see marijuana regulation similar to that of alcohol. Since 1996, 14 other states and the District of Columbia have passed medical marijuana laws. The proposition will allow the establishment of about 120 state-regulated clinics to dispense marijuana, according to the organization. Those living more than 25 miles from a clinic will be allowed to grow their own medicine. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Arizona joins 14 states and the District of Columbia .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The international race among sailors, kite surfers and wind surfers to be the fastest wind-powered boat on the planet is rapidly gaining momentum as speeds reach all-time highs. Quick sailor: French trimaran l'Hydroptere is one of the boats battling for the outright world sailing speed record. The outright world sailing speed record -- which did not change hands for 11 years after 1993 -- has been bettered four times this year alone. The new holder of the record, Alexandre Caizergues, of France, claimed it with an average speed of 50.57 knots (almost 60 miles per hour) over 500 meters on his kite board off the coast of Namibia last month. Caizergues' attempt was eventually ratified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) this month, when it was decided that kite boards would be eligible for the outright record. Meanwhile, another Frenchman, Alain Thebault, has also been closely challenging for the record on his vessel l'Hydroptere. Thebault's crew hold the 500m speed record in the boat class, and also have the overall speed record in the one nautical mile category. Then there is the Australian sailor hoping to spoil the party for the French . Paul Larsen, aboard British yacht Vestas SailRocket, has unofficially nabbed the fastest boat record from l'Hydroptere with an average speed of 47.4 knots. Larsen achieved the speed in 22 knot winds, and shortly before his unusual ""boat"" became airborne and flipped. Larsen's speed is just awaiting formal approval from the WSSRC. Thebault held the record with a speed of 46.88 knots. Even the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race has had a speed record of its own with current leader Ericsson 4 claiming the world record for the most distance sailed in a 24-hour period during the event's first leg. According to a spokesman from the WSSRC, interest in speed sailing is steadily building, and the close competition has been giving it a boost. ""Certainly towards the end of the year it's been very hectic. I think what has happened is that a number of competitors have been at the top end and they have all been competing against each other at the same venues. The development of new technologies is one factor that has increased interest in trying to break these records. ""The fact that kite boards have developed has helped ... but there is still a lot of people out there that want to achieve these records,"" the spokesman said. He said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time, and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work. ""It does seem if you are going for a specially designed boat it takes a few years before you get the design right,"" he said. The spokesman said the WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008. He said the council's job was not to promote the attempts but simply to oversee them in a fair and independent manner and ratify successful efforts. The WSSRC had a number of commissioners based around the world, he said.","Kite boarder Alexandre Caizergues, of France, holds the world sailing speed record .

"New York (CNN) -- The suspect in a hit-and-run crash that killed a Brooklyn couple and their baby has now been charged with second-degree vehicular manslaughter, the Kings County District Attorney's office announced Tuesday. ""While we knew it was a snowy evening and the defendant was speeding, our investigation has developed additional information concerning the nature of Mr. Acevedo's conduct leading up to the fatal crash,"" said District Attorney Charles J. Hynes. Julio Acevedo, 44, was indicted last week, accused of hitting a livery cab carrying Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21, on March 3. According to police, Raizy Glauber was pregnant, and the couple's son was delivered prematurely by cesarean but died the next day. An investigation found that Acevedo was traveling at almost 70 mph, more than twice the legal speed limit for where the accident happened, and fled after the collision, the district attorney's office said. Acevedo was arrested after a friend helped facilitate his surrender in the parking lot of a convenience store in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, according to New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. Acevedo has already been charged with leaving the scene of an incident, the district attorney's office said, and he pleaded not guilty. Acevedo could face up to life in prison if convicted.","Suspect in fatal crash charged with vehicular manslaughter .

"(CNN) -- This week, Barack Obama will embark on his first trip to Israel as president. The visit will enable him to engage, experience and touch Israelis in ways that move and bolster us. In seemingly small gestures that are nevertheless immensely meaningful to Israelis, and in declarations designed to be heard throughout the region, Obama will reinforce Israel's legitimacy and reassure a nation facing monumental challenges. Israelis will know -- justly, incontestably -- that we are not alone. That realization will contrast with earlier reports of Israeli skepticism about Obama and his commitment to the Jewish state. Israel is situated in a region rife with turmoil, anti-Semitism, and terror, and its survival is threatened daily. Though the Israel Defense Forces are formidable, Israelis need to feel that the leader of our greatest ally, America, always stands beside us. Obama sought to allay these concerns, telling the U.N. General Assembly in September 2011 that ""the Jewish people have forged a successful state in their historic homeland."" He repeatedly upheld the unbreakable bonds between the U.S. and Israel, and his total dedication to Israel's security. Now the president has chosen Israel as the first foreign destination of his second term. Immediately after landing, he will visit a battery of the anti-missile system, Iron Dome. Designed by Israel and funded by the president and the Congress, this particular battery was deployed at the height of November's fighting with Hamas and within an hour intercepted a terrorist rocket heading for Tel Aviv. The only anti-missile system in history to succeed in combat, Iron Dome saved lives and avoided war, affording the Israeli government the precious time needed to negotiate a cease-fire. While speaking with the young soldiers who man Iron Dome, Obama will remind the Middle East of America's pledge to enable Israel to defend itself by itself against all enemies. Less dramatic, perhaps, but no less significant will be the president's tour of the Israel Museum's treasure, the Shrine of the Book. A white-tiled structure recalling the ancient jars in which they were hidden, the Shrine houses the Dead Sea Scrolls, the world's oldest Jewish manuscripts. By surveying Hebrew texts composed in or around Jerusalem thousands of years ago, Obama will signal the unbroken link between the Jewish people and their ancient land. That message will be reiterated at Obama's last stop. Ascending the mount that serves as Israel's equivalent to Arlington National Cemetery, the president will lay a wreath at the grave of Benjamin Ze'ev (Theodor) Herzl. Fifty years before the Holocaust, Herzl envisioned the creation of a Jewish state in the land of Israel and fathered the Zionist movement. In 2010, former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, an outspoken friend of Iran, refused to pay similar homage to Herzl. Doing so, he knew, meant acknowledging the Jewish people's unassailable right to self-determination in their forebears' land. But Obama will do just that, while the Middle East watches. There will be other highlights in the president's visit. He will tour Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial, not to associate Israel's creation with the Nazis' Final Solution, but rather to reaffirm Israel's right to defend itself from genocidal threats, such as those made by Iran. The president will also address an audience of hundreds of students from leading Israeli universities, who will be eager to hear his vision for Israel and the Middle East and his appreciation of Israel's many accomplishments in the technological and scientific fields. Beyond the public events, though, Obama will be meeting at length with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Contrary to press reports, their relationship has been open and friendly. This will mark their 10th meeting and, indeed, Obama says that he has spoken to the prime minister more frequently than any foreign leader. The two leaders will discuss issues of critical importance to the security of both nations --restarting unconditional peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians to create a solution based on two states for two peoples, monitoring Syria's chemical weapons arsenal and preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. Presumably, these issues will also be raised in the president's meetings in the West Bank and Jordan. The message, however, will be the same: America remains committed to security and peace in the Middle East and dedicated to a safe and recognized Jewish state of Israel. Israel will show its appreciation for that resolve when President Shimon Peres bestows on our visitor Israel's highest civilian medal, the Presidential Medal of Distinction. By the time Air Force One takes off from Ben Gurion Airport, it will undoubtedly leave behind an Israeli people profoundly affected and reassured. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Oren.","Israeli ambassador: Barack Obama making first trip to Israel as president .

"(CNN) -- About a decade ago, Pervez Musharraf was a powerful president, torn between complicated ties with the United States and rising Islamic militants at home. After four and a half years of self-imposed exile, the former Pakistani president hopes to reassert his power. Musharraf returned to Karachi on Sunday to help his political party gain momentum prior to the May general election. The retired general, who wrested power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and lost it nine years later, acknowledges that happens next is uncertain. ""It is risky, certainly,"" he said. ""But when I formed this party, the point was to go back and fight the elections. Why I'm going back is to do something for the country. The cause is much greater than self. Therefore, I'm prepared to take the risks for the sake of my country."" More security . He may not find a warm reception. Last year, Musharraf scuttled his plans to return after being warned against doing so by the military. ""There were indications that they didn't want me to come, and my own colleagues told me not to come,"" he acknowledged. ""Therefore, I changed my mind."" This time, he said, he will be protected by his own private security agents as well as by government security. Pakistan's upper house of parliament passed a nonbinding resolution in January 2012 demanding Musharraf be arrested and tried for treason for unconstitutional acts during his regime. Musharraf's lawyer obtained pre-arrest bail for him on Friday, which means he will not be arrested for at least 15 days, but must appear in court. But Human Rights Watch said Saturday that the Pakistani government should hold Musharraf accountable for human rights abuses once he returns. ""Musharraf should not be allowed to elude the serious legal proceedings against him on his return to Pakistan,"" said Ali Dayan Hasan, Pakistan director at Human Rights Watch. ""Only by ensuring that Musharraf faces the well-documented outstanding charges against him can Pakistan put an end to the military's impunity for abuses."" Under Musharraf, the country's military and its intelligence agencies ""committed widespread human rights violations, including the enforced disappearances of thousands of political opponents, particularly from Balochistan province, and tortured hundreds of Pakistani terrorism suspects,"" Human Rights Watch said. Mixed reviews . His goal, Musharraf said, is to help lift his country from its malaise. ""My motivation is to go back and correct the situation, bring it back to the level where I left it."" He left it and went into self-imposed exile, largely in London, after the 2008 elections. But he never gave up hopes of returning to the political stage. In late 2010, he launched the All Pakistan Muslim League party with a view to running for office in 2013. His years leading the country earned mixed reviews. Under his leadership, Pakistan attained respectable economic growth rates and established a generally favorable investment climate. Along with that came a growing middle class, a more aggressive media, and a more assertive judiciary. ""He brought parliamentary reforms; he brought women into the parliament,"" said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, director of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency in an interview last year. Military mindset . But, analysts say, Musharraf never lost his military mindset. ""He in a way, always believed in a unity of command, a very centralized command, which means his command, in fact,"" said Lt. Gen. Talat Masood, a political analyst. Musharraf's popularity began dropping in 2007 after he suspended Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry for ""misuse of authority."" The move triggered protests and accusations that he was trying to influence the court's ruling on whether he could run for another five-year term. Chaudhry was reinstated but the damage was done. That October, Musharraf was re-elected president by a parliament that critics said was stacked with his supporters. Opposition parties filed a challenge. The next month, he declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge again and blacked out independent TV outlets. Under pressure from the West, Musharraf later lifted the emergency and promised elections in January 2008. He allowed Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister he had deposed in 1999, to return from exile. He also let in another political foe, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who led the Pakistan Peoples Party. Bhutto returned from a self-imposed, eight-year exile to run in the country's general elections in 2007, but was assassinated that December while campaigning in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi, the seat of the country's military, by a 15-year-old suicide bomber. Musharraf's government and the CIA contend the killing was orchestrated by a group with ties to al Qaeda, but polls found that most Pakistanis believed Musharraf's government was complicit. He has denied the assertions. Re-entering politics . In 2010, further criticism of Musharraf emerged after the United Nations ruled that Bhutto's death could have been prevented had Musharraf's government taken adequate measures to protect her. Musharraf rejected the findings, saying that Bhutto had police protection and took unnecessary risks. Other factors hastened the decline in Musharraf's popularity: a shortage of essential food items, power cuts and high inflation. In February 2008, Musharraf's party admitted defeat in parliamentary elections and he was succeeded by Asif Zardari, Bhutto's widower. The leaders of Pakistan's two main opposition parties formed a coalition and vowed to restore deposed judges. Six months later, the coalition moved to impeach Musharraf, who then resigned as president and went into self-imposed exile, though he said the allegations of misconduct were false. In August 2009, Pakistan's supreme court found that Musharraf had violated the constitution in 2007 when he imposed a national state of emergency. Government officials said that if he returned, he'd be arrested. In May 2010 Musharraf announced that he planned to re-enter Pakistan politics and launched a new political party in October of that year. But a Pakistani court then issued an arrest warrant for him in connection with Bhutto's assassination. He has said that the accusations are baseless. He has described his support as scattered, and said he needs to rebuild it. ""This is a do-or-die moment for me and my party. I need to muster all the support I can,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Residents of the nation's capital can now get a driver's license and free HIV testing -- at the same time. A Department of Motor Vehicles branch in southeast Washington is offering testing for the disease under a pilot program aimed at educating residents and reducing stigma. ""We realize that this is a nontraditional setting, but this program is about normalizing HIV and extending testing opportunities,"" said Angela Fulwood Wood, chief operations officer for nonprofit Family and Medical Counseling Service. ""We chose the DMV because it offers a good cross-section of people."" The test will be confidential, just like other HIV tests offered elsewhere, Wood said. It will be conducted by professionals and will not be part of DMV records. ""The DMV only provides space for the program,"" she said. ""It has nothing to do with the testing, it has nothing to do with the results."" The nonprofit chose this particular branch -- the Penn Branch -- because infection rates have gone up in the area, Wood said. Penn Branch also has the most visitors and can accommodate confidential space to take the HIV test, local officials said. Results of the free oral test are available in 20 minutes. Test takers will get $15 to go toward DMV costs, but Wood emphasizes that knowing one's status is the primary incentive. ""Our goal is to touch base with all the people who come into the DMV,"" Wood said. ""We want to stress this project is about education as it is about testing."" Wood said those who opt not to find out their status at the DMV office will get information on other free sites to get tested. Gilead Sciences, a California-based pharmaceutical company, provided a $250,000 grant to fund the program, according to Wood. District officials have partnered with Family and Medical Counseling Service to provide the one-year pilot. The nonprofit will offer testing and counseling, and help those who test positive get medical help through a provider of their choice, said Dr. Pierre Vigilance, director of the D.C. Department of Health. More than 3 percent of adults and adolescents are living with HIV in the capital, among the highest rates in the nation, according to Vigilance. Nationally, the prevalence of the disease is 0.5 percent. Officials were optimistic as the program kicked off Tuesday. The first-day response was ""excellent ... there has been a line waiting to get the HIV test,"" Vigilance said. ""Many people have to wait for some of the DMV services and the rapid HIV test takes only 20 minutes. It fits perfectly with the waiting times.""","NEW: Test results are confidential, not seen by DMV, nonprofit says .

"(CNN) -- Jerry Sandusky will probably be incarcerated for the rest of his life for child sex abuse convictions, but the former Penn State assistant football coach is making sure he has his say outside the prison walls. Documentary filmmaker John Ziegler interviewed Sandusky, 68, for a project he calls ""The Framing of Joe Paterno."" On Monday, NBC's ""Today"" show aired a portion of a phone conversation between the two men. In the broadcast excerpts, Sandusky questioned the credibility of prosecution witness Mike McQueary, another former Penn State assistant coach, who testified that he walked in on Sandusky raping a child in the showers at a school facility. ""I think there's a lot of things that transpired. I think these investigators, the way they went about business, you know, his story changed a lot. I think he said some things, and then it escalated on him,"" Sandusky said. ""I don't understand how anybody would have walked into that locker room from where he was and heard sounds associated that was sex going on. (laughter) You know, like he said that could've been, I mean, there was ... that would have been the last thing I would have thought about. I would've thought maybe fooling around or something like that. (laughter)"" Sandusky also discussed what Joe Paterno, the legendary Penn State head coach who was forced out as a result of the scandal, knew -- or didn't know. Paterno family: Freeh report 'factually wrong' ""If he absolutely thought I was (a pedophile), I'd say no. If he had a suspicion, I don't know the answer to that,"" Sandusky said. Ziegler wrote an open letter to the media on Sunday, and said on the ""Today"" show that ""the media, in this particular case, has an agenda. They don't want to hear what the truth is. This has been a rush to judgment from the very beginning."" ""Jerry Sandusky had his day in court. Joe Paterno never did. I am trying to get Joe Paterno, effectively, his day in court,"" Ziegler said, later adding, ""This is all about Joe Paterno's alleged culpability, which I don't believe the facts back up. I think he was railroaded."" Both Penn State and the Paterno family lambasted Sandusky and the release of his audio. ""Jerry Sandusky's statements today continue to open wounds for his victims, and the victims of child sexual abuse everywhere. We have tremendous respect for the men who came forward to tell their stories publicly,"" said Penn State spokesman David La Torre. 'The Sandusky 8' describe seduction, molestation and betrayal . And Paterno family attorney Wick Sollers released a statement saying, ""The release of the audio recording of Jerry Sandusky is a sad and unfortunate development. Sandusky had the opportunity to speak, under oath, during his trial and he chose not to do so. Releasing a recording at this time, nearly a year after he was found guilty on 45 counts, is transparently self-serving and yet another insult to the victims and anyone who cares about the truth in this tragic story. ""The Paterno family would prefer to remain silent on this matter, but they feel it is important to make it clear that they had no role in obtaining or releasing this recording. Moreover, they believe that any attempt to use this recording as a defense of Joe Paterno is misguided and inappropriate. I encourage anyone who wants to understand the facts of this case to go to Paterno.com and read the reports of former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, former FBI profiler, James Clemente, noted pedophilia expert, Dr. Fred Berlin and the King and Spalding legal team. ""From the beginning, the family has been committed to due process and a careful, objective examination of the facts. This is the path they will continue to follow."" Sandusky was sentenced in October to 30 to 60 years in prison for abusing 10 boys during a 15-year period. On February 21, he filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence with the Pennsylvania Superior Court, according to court records. Letters by Sandusky, wife blame everyone else .

"Mesa, Arizona (CNN) -- The sun is warm. The beer is cold. And the mood is as bright as the midday sky. It's spring training season, a time when hopes remain high across baseball-loving America. Here in Cactus League territory, the fans of 15 different baseball teams have descended once again on greater Phoenix — an area so dense with ballparks that even ""away"" games are often less than an hour away. There are hot dogs and hot tamales, shopping malls and swimming pools, mountaintops and margaritas — a full roster of reasons to hop on an Arizona-bound plane. Every year for six weeks or so, you can't swing a bat here without hitting a baseball fan. By the hundreds of thousands, they return each spring to cheer on the Giants or the Royals or the Reds. Still, none of those fans may be as loyal and long-suffering as those of the Chicago Cubs. For decades, they have gravitated to Mesa and luxuriated in the preseason oasis that is spring training — a shimmering sliver of optimism that may, once again, prove to be a mirage. But who needs to think about that now? Who needs to be reminded that last year the Cubs had their worst record since 1966? And, OK, that they haven't won a World Series since 1908? A non-fan's spring training pilgrimage . An authentic ballpark feel . Today, we are months away from the chilly realities of October. Today, as the first sunburn of the season settles across our skin, we are warmed and relaxed and oblivious to the sting that may follow. Perhaps the ""D"" in a Cub fan's DNA stands for denial -- or determination. Because no matter how badly the team plays (and please feel free to insert your own joke here), they still manage to break attendance records season after season. The turnout defies logic, yet it's a force of nature that cannot be denied. It's an annual phenomenon that starts here in Mesa, which has served as the preseason headquarters of the Cubs for six decades. Their home base is Hohokam Stadium, which seats 12,500 baseball traditionalists who enjoy its easy accessibility and authentic ballpark feel. ""The Cubs are really woven into the fabric here in Mesa,"" says Michelle Streeter, Visit Mesa's director of communications. ""They've been training here since 1952, so generations of Mesa residents have grown up watching and following this team."" ""So many Chicagoans are either transplants who have relocated here or folks who have purchased vacation homes here,"" she added. ""It's a rite of passage to come and cheer for the home team."" America's 11 new sandwich heroes . A new park in Wrigleyville West . Next year, the Cubs will move into a new spring training complex under construction in Mesa's Riverside, just a few miles from Hohokam in an area that's already being called Wrigleyville West, in homage to the Cubs' storied Wrigley Field. Surrounded by shops and restaurants, the new stadium will hold 15,000 and sit in a larger park that includes paths, playgrounds, practice fields and a public lake. ""We fought long and hard to stop the Cubs from going anywhere,"" Streeter says. ""We have a long friendship and kinship with them, and they are now locked in for the next 30 years. And the new stadium will be spectacular."" What won't change with the new location are the intangibles that help define the spring training season: the near-perfect weather, the camaraderie, the sense of tradition mixed with new beginnings. Hours before the game begins, tailgating Chicagoans have already set up shop in the Hohokam parking lot, where they are grilling bratwursts and launching another round of beanbag toss. Others survey the Cub merchandise at a roadside T-shirt stand that's fanned by palm fronds swaying in the breeze. Still others settle with their blankets and babies on the berm, the grassy sloping outfield that feels a bit more family-friendly than Wrigley's rowdy bleachers. There are dusty-purple mountains on the horizon. There are players signing autographs within easy reach — not just the less-familiar hopefuls but marquee major-leaguers like Alfonso Soriano, who's stooping and smiling for a photo with a little girl. And somewhere in the distance, there is ""Sweet Home, Chicago"" playing on the P.A. Long road to umpiring in the majors . '10 inches of snow back home' Kristen Stoklasa of Crystal Lake, Illinois, has made a spring pilgrimage to Hohokam every year since 2004. This time, she's here for two weeks and sharing a house with friends. Other than her madras shorts, she's kitted out entirely in team paraphernalia — from her Wrigley Field t-shirt to her Croc-style slip-ons studded with Cubs logos. She also owns a bucket hat covered with autographs she's collected in Mesa. ""It's fantastic here,"" she says, as she browses the souvenir shop in search of even more Cubs gear. ""It's a lot cheaper than the games at Wrigley Field. Plus, there are ten inches of snow back home, and here I am in shorts."" Chicago-born Paul Spokas ""just got lucky"" when he landed a job in Scottsdale, where he enjoys being part of the large Chicago expat community. His proximity to Cubs spring training has made him ""more popular"" than he was back home, he jokes, especially because it comes with temperatures in the 70s and inexpensive tickets to the game. Inside the low-slung stadium, it's easy to feel close to the action. The best seats in the house — those in the field box section — cost just $28 apiece. A spot on the berm, where you can practically chat with the outfielders, runs $8. As the afternoon settles into its final innings, the beer vendors hawk a final round of Old Style and glance over their shoulders at the scoreboard. The light that washes over the stadium takes on a golden hue. That's when it feels like, every now and then, life presents us with a perfect moment. The sun is warm. The beer is cold. And miraculously, the Cubs beat the Padres 9-3. Where to stay . A mile from Hohokam Stadium, the Phoenix Marriott Mesa is a newly renovated high-rise hotel with a Cubs baseball package rate that includes a standard room and grandstand seats for two. Located in the Mesa Riverview shopping center, the Hyatt Place at Mesa Riverview is surrounded by shops and restaurants and will enjoy an even better home advantage when the new stadium opens in Riverside next spring. For more suggestions, check the Visit Mesa list of hotels. 5 great baseball stadiums . What to visit . At the Mesa Historical Museum, situated less than a mile from Hohokam Stadium in downtown Mesa, baseball fans can take in ""Play Ball: The Cactus League Experience,"" a year-round exhibit on Mesa's role in the founding of the Cactus League. Among the baseball memorabilia and other historical items on display are team uniforms from the early 1900s. For those whose interests extend beyond the outfield wall, the Mesa Arts Center offers live music, dance, comedy and theater performances, plus gallery spaces and free lunchtime concerts. Where to eat . Originally owned by Cub announcers Harry Caray and Steve Stone, Diamond's Sports Grille may be the closest thing to The Cubby Bear outside of Wrigleyville. It offers a pre-home-game breakfast buffet and such pun-laden menu categories as ""The Starting Line-Up,"" ""Field of Greens,"" ""Designated Hitters"" and ""For the Little Leaguers"" — plus Chicago favorites Goose Island and Old Style beer to wash it all down. There's also a free shuttle service to and from Hohokam. Chicago transplant Paul Spokas takes visiting Cub fans to West Addison Sports Bar in Scottsdale, named for one of the landmark streets that bounds Wrigley Field. The pub doubles as the hangout of choice for Chicago Bears and Notre Dame football fans. He also rejoiced when Portillo's opened recently in Scottsdale, with a second location being planned near the new stadium. Already, its Chicago-style hot dogs, Polish sausages and Italian beef have proved so popular that it takes a traffic cop to keep the customers flowing. Unfortunately, Spokas says, ""I still haven't found a deep-dish pizza here like home.""","The Cactus League allows fans of 15 different teams to celebrate the start of baseball .

"(CNN) -- It's a loaded question, one with no clear answer. But in the year since Apple's co-founder and visionary CEO died, it's been asked in tech circles over and over: . Who is the next Steve Jobs? There's one easy response. It's safe to say that no figure in the tech industry will perfectly duplicate the unique blend of vision, salesmanship, mystique and eye for detail possessed by Jobs, who died one year ago Friday. And it's complicated further, some say, by the fact that for much of his own life, many wouldn't have predicted Jobs himself would earn tech-icon status. ""Steve Jobs had a strange career. He really wasn't celebrated as a genius until really late,"" said Leander Kahney, editor of the Cult of Mac blog and author of books on Apple, including ""Inside Steve's Brain."" Not until Jobs returned to Apple and introduced the iPod and iPhone did people begin to praise him as a modern-day Thomas Edison, Kahney said. ""He was dismissed before then as a marketing guy, a fast talker who didn't know much about technology. He only really was lionized in the last four or five years."" #WhatSteveJobsTaughtMe: Share your thoughts on his life and career . But industry observers abhor a vacuum. Futile though it might be, it's perhaps human nature to speculate about who could emerge to fill the void left by the passing of tech's biggest personality and most recognizable face. One can make cases for or against a handful of nominees. And no list is long enough to include an as-yet unknown creator who may be birthing the industry's next game-changer in a garage or dorm room somewhere. Did Apple's fanboy fever peak with Steve Jobs? But here are some names worth considering, with thoughts both for and against their candidacies: . Jeff Bezos, CEO, Amazon . Pros: Bezos actually has a host of traits that mirror Jobs. Like Jobs was with Apple, he's the founder of Amazon as well as its CEO. Being a part of a company's life story helps. As much as anyone, Bezos also captures a bit of Jobs' panache at live events. At last year's rollout of the Kindle Fire, he got high marks for introducing a game-changing product in a stylized fashion, then getting off the stage. (Tech giants Google and Microsoft have been accused of being rambling and unfocused at similar unveilings.) Reports say Bezos shares Jobs' penchant for attention to detail (some would say micromanaging) and, like Jobs, he's been willing to take the company into new and unexpected directions. ""I've met Bezos personally, and he is mesmeric. Brilliant smile, quick mind, very engaging and decisive,"" Kahney told CNN. ""He has the same obsession with the ordinary consumer; to make and sell things from the consumer's point of view. ... Bezos has Jobs' focus and drive. He's a little bit maniacal in his drive and ambition."" Cons: Despite the Kindle line, Amazon is, at its core, a content company. The mobile devices are a means of delivering books, music, movies and other data to customers as directly as possible. Will the public ever be as excited about the CEO of the company that peddles e-books and data-storage space as it was about the one that sold it its personal computers, laptops, phones and music players? Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook . Pros: The Steves -- Jobs and Wozniak -- had their garage. Zuckerberg had his Harvard dorm room. And in those two rooms, perhaps the two best-known origin stories in tech were born. As head of the social network that has changed the way people use the Internet, Zuckerberg is maybe the only tech boss who, like Jobs, has become a household name. (""The Social Network"" didn't hurt.) He created a product that millions of people now use. And he's even cultivated his own trademark, casual-wear style, as the Zuckerberg hoodie is now almost as iconic as Jobs' mock turtleneck. ""Zuckerberg has some of the characteristics (of Jobs), and perhaps the most important one -- the pursuit of a vision,"" Kahney said. ""That sets him apart."" Cons: He's gotten better at speaking in public. But as a pitchman, Zuckerberg still falls miles short of the charismatic Jobs. It's seems Zuck would rather be the idea man behind the scenes than front-and-center when it comes time to sell the final product. Also, the fact that Facebook's stock price is not already racing toward Google/Apple heights doesn't help. Tim Cook, CEO, Apple . Pros: Well, there's the obvious one. Job's was Apple's CEO. Now Cook is. At the helm of the company, Cook gets to be the face of every new innovation rolled out by Apple. He's got the biggest stage and brightest spotlight in which to put himself forward. Cons: Cook comes from more of a business background than one of innovation and design. He may masterfully steer Apple's course for years to come, but, rightly or not, few observers at this juncture are inclined to give him credit for vision, or influence over products' design, the way they did Jobs. Plus, being Apple CEO after Jobs is like being the football coach who follows a retiring Bear Bryant or Vince Lombardi. What were those guys' names? Exactly. Jonathan Ive, senior vice president, Apple . Pros: When Jobs stepped down, there were many who expected Ive, not Cook, to step up. Ive is senior vice president of industrial design and is believed to be the creative mind behind products from the Macbook Pro to the iPod to the iPad. The London native already has a knighthood, as well as a healthy dose of Jobs' true-believer passion for the product. Cons: Well, he's not the CEO. (Nor is marketing mastermind Phil Schiller, another name bandied about to replace Jobs). To truly ascend to Jobsian levels, Ive would need to set out on his own -- which, at 45, is doable. It's hard to envision Ive bolting from Apple, where he's worked since 1992. But, boy, it would be fun to watch. Marissa Mayer, CEO, Yahoo . Pros: If you need proof of how well Google alum Mayer is liked in Silicon Valley, just look at the number of folks she's been able to lure to join her at a Yahoo that was floundering when she took the reins in July. At Google, where the former engineer was the 20th employee, she's credited with everything from the clean design of the search page to becoming one of the leading public faces of the tech giant. Cons: It looks like a turnaround has begun at Yahoo. But the job's still a long way from done. If Mayer becomes the face of a dramatic rebirth, she will have accomplished something few predicted. If she doesn't (the four CEOs before her all fell short), it likely won't hurt her reputation all that much -- but neither will it bump her up to the next level. Elon Musk, serial entrepreneur . Pros: How's this for an origin story? Musk grew up in South Africa before leaving home at 17, without his parents' consent, rather than serve a compulsory stint in an army which, at the time, was enforcing the race-based apartheid system. He'd end up in the United States four years later -- although he'd already sold his first software, a video game called Blastar, when he was 12. Since then, all he's done is create publishing software Zip2 (sold to AltaVista for $300 million), co-found PayPal (he owned 11% of its stock when eBay bought it for $1.5 billion) and help create Tesla Motors, makers of the first commercial electric car. Oh, wait ... he also runs SpaceX, a company working on space exploration. Director Jon Favreau says Musk was his inspiration for Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark character in the ""Iron Man"" movies. ""His ambitions are so huge,"" Kahney said. ""He's definitely a ballsy character. And he's a good leader, like Jobs. He's surrounded himself with good people."" Cons: With the exception of Tesla, none of Musk's projects, so far, have directly involved consumer products. Tens of millions of people had something Jobs made in their pockets, on their desks or piping music into their ears. Among the public, Musk may be less well-known than all of the names above -- at least for now. But, at 41, he's got time to change that and it would be foolish to bet against him. Seth Priebatsch, CEO, SCVNGR, LevelUp . Pros: Who? Priebatsch is the wild card on this list. But consider him the representative of a new generation of young, creative tech ""makers"" who could ascend to loftier heights in the years, or decades, to come. At 22, Priebatsch's SCVNGR raised more than $20 million in funding. He founded his first Web company at 12 and has moved on to start LevelUp, a mobile-payments system that's also raked in millions from investors. He got rock-star treatment for a speech he gave last year at South by Southwest Interactive. Plus, he's already cultivated a Jobs-like signature fashion statement -- his trademark orange sunglasses and shirts. Cons: In the startup world, for every success story, there are countless washouts. Not every young turk even wants to be another Jobs, and not every killer app has the potential to make millions, or billions, of dollars -- even when they're well-liked and widely used.

"(CNN) -- Arash Alaei, a pioneering HIV and AIDS doctor, has been released from an Iranian prison, his family said Sunday. Both he and his brother, Kamiar Alaei, who is also a doctor, were arrested in 2008. They were charged with ""communication with an enemy government"" and for trying to ""overthrow the government,"" according to Kamiar. Kamiar Alaei served most of a three-year sentence and was released in October 2010. Since then, he has fought for his brother's freedom. ""My dearest friends, colleagues and family thank you so much for your tireless help and support. I am pleased to share our happiness that my brother got released today. I am very happy that other prisoners got released, too and now their parents, family members and friends got reunion after a while. What a lovely day!"" he wrote on his Facebook page. A post attributed to the Alaei family said that Arash was released after spending 1,160 days in prison. The brothers have been called pioneers for their community-based approach to HIV and AIDS in Iran. Since opening a hometown clinic in 1999, the men raised awareness about HIV, dispelling myths about the virus and treating people who are shunned because of it. They also reached out to their neighbors in Afghanistan and Tajikistan and worked with medical universities in Europe and the United States. Earlier this month, Kamiar told CNN being free without his brother was the worst feeling and that sometimes he wished he was in and that his brother was out. ""I have to be clear,"" he said then. ""All our work was focused on health and science. It was never about politics. When we were arrested, I was shocked and I thought they must have the wrong people.""","Arash Alaei was arrested, along with his brother, in 2008 .

"(Mashable) -- You can now use Skype credit to pay for Wi-Fi access on your iPhone or iPad. The Internet phone giant launched ""Skype WiFi"" in the Apple store Wednesday, an app that allows you to connect to more than 1 million Wi-Fi hotspots around the world -- and only pay for the minutes you use. Unlike hotspot services such as Boingo (which powers Skype's mobile Wi-Fi service), which require a day pass or a monthly subscription, Skype Wifi charges Wi-Fi users by the minute. Access rates start at $0.06 per minute, but may be more depending on the provider. The service has previously been available for laptops under the label ""Skype Access.""

"(CNN) -- This election season, the term ""Super PAC"" has escaped from the obscure world of campaign finance lawyers to emerge on the front pages of major newspapers and political websites. Super PACs are political organizations that can take unlimited sums from individuals, corporations and labor unions to spend in support of, or opposition to, federal candidates. To do so legally, a Super PAC must avoid  certain forms of coordination with candidates. The groups played a big role in Iowa, with a pro-Mitt Romney Super PAC, ""Restore Our Future,"" widely credited with running ads that halted Newt Gingrich's momentum in the polls. They are expected to play an even greater role in the fall, when control of the White House, Senate and U.S. House of Representatives will be up for grabs. Super PACs are troublesome for a number of reasons. They tend to run more negative advertising, since they are able to act as the ""evil twin"" of campaigns because they are not accountable to voters the way candidate committees are. Thanks to holes in our disclosure laws, which neither Congress nor the Republican commissioners on the Federal Election Commission have seen fit to fix, we don't know who is funding many of the Super PACs. Candidates can even raise money under certain conditions for supportive Super PACs without violating the FEC's technical coordination rules. And thanks to clever campaign finance lawyers who can use an affiliated nonprofit 501(c)(4) group, we may never know the identity of some donors. (That's why comedian Stephen Colbert formed his 501(c)(4) ""Colbert Super PAC SHH"" (as in ""hush"") to funnel money to his regular ""Colbert Super PAC."") But the greatest danger of Super PACs is that they may skew the legislative process in the next Congress in favor of the interests of large Super PAC contributors. To understand why, we need to go back to the Supreme Court's controversial 2010 opinion in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment barred a federal law preventing corporations and unions from spending their own funds to influence the outcome of elections. Key to this ruling was the court's statement that independent spending (that is, spending not coordinated with candidates) cannot corrupt the political process. From there, lower courts and the FEC, spurred by opponents of campaign finance regulation, led the way for the creation of Super PACs. As I have explained, first they concluded that if independent spending cannot corrupt, then an individual's contributions to an independent group cannot corrupt. (Gone was the $5,000 per person contribution limit to political action committees -- or PACs -- which only spend independently to support or oppose federal candidates.) Second, they concluded that if an individual's contributions to one of these Super PACs cannot corrupt, then neither can a corporation's or a labor union's contribution. (Corporations now have a way to influence elections anonymously, thus avoiding the risk of alienating customers who may object to their choice of candidates.) But the initial supposition is wrong. Independent spending can corrupt. The main reason the Supreme Court has rejected challenges to campaign contribution limits (currently set at $2,500 per election to federal candidates) is that large contributions can create the actuality and appearance of corruption of those candidates. A candidate who receives a large contribution will feel grateful to the contributor, and legislative policy could well skew in the contributor's direction. Well what of the six- and seven-figure donors to Super PACs supporting federal candidates? Federal officeholders are likely to feel just as indebted to them. And federal officeholders may do the bidding of other wealthy individuals, corporations and labor unions out of fear that they will support the official's opponents through a Super PAC in the next election if they don't. Given the expected vast spending by presidential candidates and parties in the general election, I am not very concerned that Super PAC spending will influence the outcome of the presidential election, though it might. I am not even that concerned about Super PAC negative advertising, which can serve to educate the public and mobilize some voters to become more politically engaged. But I am concerned that Super PAC spending will influence the outcome of close Senate and congressional races. And I am greatly concerned that when Election Day is over and the public will stop hearing about Super PACs, contributions to these groups will skew public policy away from the public interest and toward the interest of the new fat cats of campaign finance, as members of the House and Senate thank their friends and look over their shoulder at potential new enemies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard L. Hasen.","Richard Hasen: Super PACs have emerged in a big way as funders of campaign ads .

"(CNN) -- I grew up in an interfaith home where I learned, despite what some on the far right allege today, that Islam and Christianity have much in common. My father was Muslim and born in the 1930s in what was then known as Palestine. My mother is Italian (Sicilian, to be accurate) and proudly Christian. My family was the embodiment of the American Dream: An immigrant father and first generation mother of differing ethnicities and faiths, who did more than just co-exist: They flourished. Our mini ""melting pot"" succeeded because we focused on the commonalities between Islam and Christianity, the most obvious being that we worship the same God. How could we not? After all, we share almost identical prophets such as Moses, Abraham and Jesus. My Muslim cousins would even celebrate Christmas with us every year - -not only to be social, but because there's a religious basis. To Muslims, Jesus is a prophet referred to in the Quran as ""The Messiah,"" born of the Virgin Mary, who was herself born of immaculate conception. Growing up in North Jersey in the 1980s, no one expressed any issues with our heritage or faith. In fact, in third grade my teacher asked me to bring my father to school for ""show and tell"" so the students could meet an Arab Muslim man. I can only imagine if this event was replicated today, some would protest, claiming my father was there trying to spread sharia law or convert the children to Islam. Despite my upbringing in a very ethnic home, by September 11, 2001, I identified as a typical white American. I wasn't Dean Obeidallah, the Arab-American, I was just Dean. As I have joked in my stand-up act, I didn't have any Arab friends before 9/11. All my friends had names like Joey, Chandler and Monica. But as I stood on the corner of Eighth Street and Sixth Avenue in Lower Manhattan on that fateful September morning watching in horror as the towers crumbled before my eyes, I knew all our lives would change. I just never could have predicted the trajectory my own life would take. Soon after 9/11, I found that my membership in ""The White Club"" had been revoked. I was now a minority, which, truthfully, was not something I wanted to be. I'm not saying being a white person in America is easy, but being a minority in America is a completely different kind of challenge, for the simple reason that as a minority you aren't only responsible for yourself, you are also called to answer for the sins of the worst in your minority group. In time I began to embrace my Arab roots. I soon decided to use my comedy, whenever possible, to counter the misconceptions my fellow Americans harbored about Arabs and Muslims. Now, 10 years after 9/11, I have grown accustomed to and even enjoy my minority status. But I do have a grave concern: I have never witnessed more anti-Muslim rhetoric espoused by politicians, religious leaders and in media outlets than I do today. Not even in the days after 9/11. There was a time in our nation's history when if you wanted to demonize a religion or race, you had to wear a white sheet over your head. Not any longer. Indeed, peddlers of hate wouldn't want to cover their face because they want people to know who they are so they can sell more books, secure more well paying speaking engagements, and appear more often on television. (I'm looking at you Fox News!) But I'm fully confident this will pass. In fact, I have already observed encouraging signs. Recently, the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization created in 1971 to expose the activities of hate groups, listed leaders of the Muslim hate movement in the same league as The Aryan Terror Brigade, the American Nazi Party, and the Ku Klux Klan. Thankfully, this begins the marginalization of these Muslim hate groups to the fringes of American society where they justly belong. More interfaith alliances between Muslims, Christians and Jews have been formed. In fact, American Catholic.org's national magazine features a cover story this month designed to dispel misconceptions about Islam and bring Catholics and Muslims closer together. (Some forget that right-wing Americans had alleged that Catholics and democracy could not exist together and that a Catholic candidate for president -- John F. Kennedy -- would, if elected, follow the directives of the pope, not the U.S. Constitution.) This week, the national Jewish Daily Forward published an editorial entitled, ""Remember Who We Are,"" imploring Jewish Americans to reject the extremist voices of hate that target American Muslims and specifically called on, by name, the few Jewish people involved in the Muslim hate movement to stop. We must stand together today as Americans, just as we did in 2001 after the attacks. We cannot allow those who promote hate, either here or abroad, to divide our nation. As then presidential candidate John F. Kennedy cautioned America in 1960 while defending himself against anti-Catholic attacks: ""Today, I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you -- until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah says he grew up an American in Jersey with Muslim dad, Catholic mom .
He says after September 11 he found others now saw him as a suspicious Muslim .
He says hate groups profit from anti-Muslim speech, but they are starting to be marginalized .
Obeidallah: On 9/11 in particular we can't allow others to blind us to our commonality ."
"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping called Tokyo's territorial claims on a group of East China Seas island ""a farce,"" he echoed national sentiment of protesters who took to the streets in anti-Japan protests in recent weeks. ""Japan should rein in its behavior, not utter any words and prevent any acts that undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" said Xi -- who is expected to become China's new president next month -- at a Wednesday meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, state media reported. As Beijing's presumptive new leader wades into the Japan-China dispute, analysts say the stakes are being raised in a dispute that is largely being led by nationalist fervor rather than government policy or underlining economic interests. And the dÃ©tente that usually follows these territorial disputes is muddied by the leadership change in Beijing expected next month. ""This is where it's becoming dangerous,"" said Alan DuPont, defense expert at the University of New South Wales. ""No incoming Chinese leader can be perceived to be weak on territorial claims."" On Monday, the Japan Coast Guard said two Chinese surveillance ships entered its territorial waters, while 10 other Chinese ships patrolled nearby. Meanwhile, China announced Sunday it was postponing planned celebrations later this month marking the 40th anniversary of normalization of relations between Beijing and Tokyo. The bellicose rhetoric also charts the rise of an assertive China and a sea change in the forces shaping Pacific politics that are writ small in the battle over the uninhabited island chain, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. ""China's feeling more confident both in its position and in its right to the area both legally and politically,"" Mark Valencia, a fellow at the National Asia Research Program and expert on the South China Sea dispute. ""And nationalism in China has gained strength and influencing the government."" Rising tensions in China waters . The East China Sea isn't the only flashpoint for territorial tensions among China and its neighbors. The South China Sea is dotted with hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls, many of which have competing claims from China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Just like the friction with Japan, there have been increasing incidents of tension between China and its South China Sea neighbors over island claims. In 2011, Vietnam claimed that Chinese patrol boats cut cables from PetroVietnam boats during oil and gas surveys in disputed waters. Beijing said that Vietnamese vessels have been illegally surveying in Chinese waters and harassing Chinese fishing boats. The same year Philippines also reported boats cutting cables of a survey ship and threatening to ram its boats. ""A lot of this wouldn't be happening if China wasn't becoming more assertive and being more confident, and that's one important issue why all these issues are becoming more salient,"" DuPont said. The difference in the East China Sea is the collective might of China and Japan, the second and third largest economies in the world, respectively. ""When you have two major nation states involved, it's more dangerous than the (South China Sea),"" DuPont said. A nationalist wave . The often violent protests that broke out in dozens of Chinese cities -- from Guangzhou in the south to Qingdao in the north -- came to a head after the Japanese government bought the disputed islands from the Japanese family that have privately owned the islands on September 11 for 2.05 billion yen (US$26.2 million). Dozens of Japanese factories and businesses temporarily shut their doors in the wake of the violence as angry crowds overturned Japanese brand cars and looted Japanese stores in some areas. The island dispute, which traces back centuries, have reached diplomatic boiling points in 1996, 2005 and most recently in 2010, when a Chinese boat allegedly rammed a Japanese patrol boat, resulting in the arrest of the Chinese sailors. ""I don't think anyone thought the Chinese reaction would have been as strong as it was, and I don't think anyone expected the level of violence that we saw, especially looking at past incidents,"" said James Manicom, an expert on maritime disputes at the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Waterloo, Canada. The ""nationalization"" of the islands infuriated Chinese, although analysts say Tokyo's move was an effort to wrest the issue away from Japanese nationalists, led by Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara who launched an online appeal to buy the islands. Donations poured in, prompting a sharp rebuke from China and forcing the Japanese government to wade into the dispute with its own offer for the contested land. ""If you're interested in stability, the Japanese government is better than owning the islands than a group of nationalists, because who knows how they might raise tensions,"" Manicom said. ""(Prime Minister) Noda's calculation is, this is going to explode in the short-run, in the long run it's better."" Economic interests . Although nationalistic ardor on both sides of the dispute have brought the current situation to a boil, national interest in the territory can be traced to a 1969 United Nations geological survey that contains this tantalizing line: ""A high probability exists that the continental shelf between Taiwan and Japan may be one of the most prolific oil reserves in the world."" Also under its South China Sea lie potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil. A Chinese estimate suggests as much as 213 billion barrels of oil lie untapped in the South China Sea - which, if true, would make it the largest oil reserves outside of Saudi Arabia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At the heart of all these island disputes in China Seas is a term of international maritime law known as ""Exclusive Economic Zone,"" where nations are allowed sole rights to fish and develop resources within 200 nautical miles of a country's shores. That has created interest in nation's grabbing uninhabited islands - often little more than rocky atolls - to thereby extend their zone. ""The area is starting to look a little bit like Alaska, at first looked worthless, now may not be worthless,"" Valencia said. ""The East China Sea is virtually all continental shelf, which means it's all relatively easy digging except in typhoon season."" But the likelihood the areas will be developed dwindles as the political storm brews between China and Japan. If this fracas follows past contretemps, the two sides will cool for a few months before rapprochement from high-level officials on both sides. But with the leadership change coming in China, and leadership elections imminent in Japan's two major parties, the likelihood is tensions will remain high. ""No one wants to be perceived as soft on China,"" Manicom said. Meanwhile, as historic enmities over Japan's war past inflame tensions in China, public sentiment is changing in Japan toward China. ""The result is the average Japanese person views China with more suspicion than the past,"" Manicom said. ""You can now be anti-China in Japan and not be conservative, which is a development that I think took Beijing by surprise.""","Analysts: Nationalism, not economics, is driving the dispute between Beijing and Tokyo .
Leadership change in China next month will likely keep the issue boiling for longer .
Rising might and confidence of Beijing also at play in growing territorial disputes .
Nationalists in Japan have been driving Tokyo moves on the Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute ."
"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho may believe the English Premier League title race is already over but reigning champions Manchester City kept alive their slim hopes of retaining the crown with Monday's 1-0 win at Aston Villa. The victory cut the gap on arch rivals and championship leaders Manchester United to 12 points with 10 matches of the EPL season remaining, including a return clash between the top two at the beginning of April. It was a disciplined display from Roberto Mancini's men, who owed their victory to a neatly-taken goal by Argentina international Carlos Tevez just before halftime. Defeat left Villa deep in relegation trouble in 18th place with just 24 points in the bag. While Mourinho's Real Madrid team were training at City's Etihad Stadium ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United, their temporary landlords were making their way to the testing fixture at Villa Park, knowing dropped points would end all hopes in the title race. An even first half offered Paul Lambert's strugglers hope they could at least get something from the match and striker Christian Benteke was a threat throughout with his muscular presence. At the other end Pablo Zabaleta rattled the Villa woodwork, but a defensive mistake just before the interval was to cost the home side dear. Defender Ciaran Clark was robbed by substitute Edin Dzeko -- on after England midfielder Jack Rodwell went off with a hamstring problem -- and the Bosnian played in Tevez. He cleverly dummied goalkeeper Brad Guzan and slotted the ball home. After the break there was almost a repeat as this time Mathew Lowton was caught napping by Dzeko but the defender got back to clear Tevez's shot off the line. Benteke continued to be a nuisance to the end, but City defended stoutly to move five points clear of third-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who had closed to within two after Sunday's derby win over Arsenal. Mancini was delighted with his team's efforts. ""I think it is very important to win this game. For us it was important to stay 12 points behind, the championship is not over,"" he told Sky Sports. And he had a word of consolation for Villa. ""I think they will stay in the Premier League,"" he predicted. Meanwhile, in Monday's Spanish La Liga action, Sevilla won 4-1 at home to third-bottom Celta Vigo to move up to 10th place. Striker Alvaro Negredo scored a fine hat-trick to take his tally to 13 in the league this season.","Manchester City win 1-0 at Aston Villa in English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Military forces used thermal imaging technology and other specialized equipment to help search for victims buried in rubble from Monday's devastating tornado outside Oklahoma City. The government's disaster response was led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with the military acting in a support role. President Barack Obama has pledged a range of federal resources if requested in response to the massive twister that tore a 17-mile path of destruction through central Oklahoma. At least 24 people were killed and more than 230 others hurt, authorities said. So far Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin has activated 241 Oklahoma Army and Air National Guard troops. ""When you actually get out here and see the devastation, all the people that are affected by it, it really hits hard,"" said Spc. Josh Gragert of the Oklahoma National Guard. ""I've got a friend I work with that his house was leveled."" Additionally, active duty firefighting crews from Tinker Air Force base near the hardest hit area in Moore responded. Rescuers pored over collapsed buildings and homes and other devastation searching for survivors. Many of the Oklahoma guardsmen have night vision goggles and thermal imaging equipment and used the technology overnight. ""We can get in with the thermal imagers and night vision and see in the dark and hopefully help find survivors,"" said 2nd Lt. Gabriel Bird of the Oklahoma Air National Guard. At least 100 people have been pulled alive from tornado wreckage. The U.S. Army base at Ft. Sill in Lawton, about 125 miles southwest of Oklahoma City and home of the Army's artillery training school, will be used to stage equipment and supplies for FEMA. No active duty troops from that facility had been deployed yet for tornado relief, Ft. Sill's public affairs office said. It is unlikely at this point that the region will see a large-scale military presence in the area similar to what was seen after Hurricane Katrina. Neither Tinker AFB nor Ft. Sill suffered any major damage. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","National Guard troops use thermal imaging to search for survivors in rubble .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer refused to blame an ongoing back problem after being dumped out at Indian Wells by long-term rival Rafael Nadal. Federer, who could now drop to World No.3 should Andy Murray reach the final, was beaten 6-4 6-2 by the Spaniard. The 31-year-old looked to be playing through the pain barrier during his last-16 win over compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka just 24 hours earlier. But the 17-time grand slam winner did not use his back complaint as an excuse for his performance as his quest for a record fifth triumph at Indian Wells fell flat. Federer, Nadal to renew rivalry . ""[It was the] same as against Stan. I mean, I could play,"" Federer told reporters. ""I'm happy to be out there and able to compete. But it's obviously a small issue."" Instead, Nadal avenged last year's semifinal defeat by the Swiss and took his record to 19-10 in matches against Federer. But the manner of victory was not lost on Nadal, who was quick to acknowledge the limitations of his opponent. ""I played a fantastic first set, in my opinion. The second set was strange,"" said Nadal. ""The second set, I think Roger didn't fight as usual. He probably had some problems and he didn't feel comfortable enough to keep fighting. ""Both of us tried to play our best. I played much better than yesterday. ""My movements today were much, much better than yesterday, so I'm very happy for that, especially after a long match yesterday, to be able to compete well the next day."" Federer: Good to have Rafa back . This was the earliest the pair had met in a regular tournament since 2004, when Nadal won their first meeting in the third round of the Sony Open Tennis in Miami. The 26-year-old will now face Tomas Berdych in his eighth consecutive semifinal at Indian Wells. The women's quarterfinals were blighted by injury after defending champion Victoria Azarenka and seventh seed Sam Stosur both pulled out with injury. Djokovic, Azarenka extend unbeaten runs . Azarenka, ranked two in the world, was forced to withdraw with tendinitis and inflammation in her right foot and ankle. ""That's frustrating for me as a player, not knowing,"" Azarenka told reporters after revealing she is unsure of her recovery time. ""Sometimes you think, OK, well, I rest three days and I'm going to be fine with it. But when you don't know the healing process it's a little bit frustrating."" Stosur's calf injury gifted Germany's fourth seed Angelique Kerber a place in the last four where she will now play Caroline Wozniacki. In the other semifinal, 2006 winner Maria Sharapova will face fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko. It is the first time Kirlenko has made the final four at Indian Wells following wins over Agnieszka Radwanska and former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova.","Rafael Nadal defated Roger Federer 6-4 6-2 in quarterfinal at Indian Wells .
