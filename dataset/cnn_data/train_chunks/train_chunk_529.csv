One of Vincent van Gogh’s most renowned works, Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe, is one of the piece's interpreted by the artist using his iron. Known for his distinctive self-portraits, this particular piece captures van Gogh after he famously cut off part of his own ear - although historians have debated whether he was maimed by somebody else. Completed in 1889, the year before his death, the painting shows van Gogh smoking a pipe and wearing a hat. It is currently part of a private collection.

Hundreds of thousands of elderly people across the country live out their lives in almost complete isolation - many of whom admit the only person they regularly speak to is 'the boy in the shop when I pick up my paper', according to recent research. Experts say that loneliness . increases the risk of heart disease, puts people at greater risk of . blood clots and dementia, makes sufferers less likely to exercise and more . likely to drink more.

Big problem: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, who is launching the initiative, claims the move will lead to better care for people feeling social isolation . Mr Hunt said: 'Tackling loneliness, by . giving people better care and improved services, is another step . towards making the UK one of the best places to live in Europe for older . people. 'We need a measure of loneliness to shine a light on this problem and to know what we are dealing with.

'Loneliness creates a loss of confidence, an erosion of self-esteem, so . that the front door becomes as solid as a brick wall and as impossible . to break through.'

The young wife of North Korea’s leader has made her first public appearance in two months, bringing to an end what might have been a period of ‘home detention’ for being too carefree. Ri Sol-ju had been photographed earlier this year smiling and strolling about in a casual manner when accompanying her husband Kim Jong-un, the newly appointed leader of the secretive Stalinist state. But then she disappeared from view, provoking speculation that she might be pregnant but more likely because she was not presenting the dour image promoted by her husband’s late father, Kim Jong-il. The happy couple: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un walks arm in arm with his wife Ri Sol-ju in July, before she her two-month absence . Analysts say that despite the young Kim’s appointment as supreme commander of the nation, he is still under the control of the military hierarchy who make sure he presents a rigid, authoritative image to the rest of the world. That means that his wife must remain aloof and untouchable in the eyes of the masses, say North Korean experts. But now Ri is back in the public eye and fuzzy tv pictures from North Korea show her enjoying the company of her husband at a football match and a musical concert this week. According to the official KCNA news agency, the couple’s appearance at the concert ‘drew a thunderous cheer from the audience’. The couple’s attendance also marked the first public appearance in two weeks by Kim Jong-un himself, raising speculation that he has been receiving behavioural advice from the military hierarchy. Too cheerful? Analysts think Ri was kept at home because she appeared too 'carefree' South Korea’s intelligence agency is convinced that the sudden disappearance of Ri from state media since early September is because the nation’s elders had raised an issue over her casual and cheerful demeanour. ‘The analysis has been that there was concern over breach of discipline (by Ri) among North Korean elders, plus the speculation of pregnancy,’ reported South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper, quoting the National Intelligence Service which had giving a closed-door briefing to parliament. Photos taken at the concert showed Ri in a long cream coat and what appeared to be a thickening waistline, strengthening speculation that she is pregnant. It was also being suggested she had been kept at home as a disciplinary measure because she had been seen in public not displaying a red lapel pin bearing the image, or images, of the two previous leaders. All senior North Koreans and any working for the government must wear them. Dress to impress: High ranking North Koreans must wear the red lapel pins as pictured above . A pin is not visible in the latest photos of Ri but she might be wearing it under her coat. If Ri is pregnant and she gives birth to a son the Kim dynasty is assured. If she has a girl analysts say the hierarchy will insist she ‘tries again’. The South Koreans have carefully studied photographs of Kim and his wife, published over four pages in the North’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper. Facial expressions and the people who accompany the couple are all of vital importance to intelligence-gatherers. It was last July that North Korea finally put an end to speculation about the young woman seen accompanying Kim at numerous events in and around the capital, Pyongyang. She was, said state media, his wife – and that announcements was seen as a slight lifting of the veil of mystery hiding events in the country. But just as it seemed North Korea was lightening its hard, reclusive image, the temporary disappearance of Ri has left analysts wondering if anything has really changed there at all.

Nicolas Sarkozy had at least eight ‘secret’ meetings with the prosecutor investigating him over corruption allegations, a French court has heard. Mr Sarkozy is facing possible charges that he took cash in envelopes from France’s richest woman Liliane Bettencourt, the l’ Oreal heiress, to fund his election campaign in 2007. Yesterday, a Bordeaux court questioned the close relationship between the former president and investigator Philippe Courroye, who was in charge of the enquiry until November 2010. Nicolas Sarkozy (left) could face charges over taking money from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt . The pair were said to have met regularly when details of the Bettencourt case began to be investigated while Sarkozy was still president. Details of the meetings – some of which took place in public parks or at dinner parties – emerged in emails and other correspondence seized from Sarkozy’s office. One secret meeting took place on June 10th 2010 – two days after member of Mrs Bettencourt’s family had made submissions to the Paris financial brigade. The Bordeaux court is considering formal charges against Sarkozy over his links with Mrs Bettencourt. Jacques Chirac also went through a criminal trial for fraud which resulted in a suspended sentence . Judicial sources in Bordeaux confirmed that Judge Gentil was considering action over the highly suspicious ‘eight rendezvous’ between the prosecutor and politician, who had known each other for some 12 years. While some believe Sarkozy will be quizzed ‘as a witness’, judicial sources told AFP, France’s national news agency, that ‘he may be indicted’. This would mean him facing the kind of criminal trial which his former mentor and predecessor as conservative president, Jacques Chirac, went through. Chirac ended up receiving a suspended prison sentence for fraud last December, becoming the first head of state in the history of the Fifth Republic to be treated as a common criminal. In Sarkozy’s case, Judge Gentil is also examining evidence that Sarkozy ‘abused the weakness’ of Mrs Bettencourt, who celebrated her 90th birthday on Wednesday. Investigators are examining the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of euros from Swiss bank accounts, and the claim that cash was delivered in brown envelopes. In return, it is claimed, Mrs Bettencourt was offered massive tax breaks on her multi-million pounds fortune after Sarkozy came to power. Sarkozy, who lost May’s presidential election to Socialist Francois Hollande, has denied a series of allegations of illegal campaign financing.","Former French president facing charges that he took cash from France's richest women, Liliane Bettencourt .

A family desperate to lose weight cut out junk food and alcohol and have shed a massive 25 stone between them. The Kidd/Robinson family were shocked into a healthier lifestyle last year after daughter Lisa Robinson, 32, was told she would be wheelchair-bound for life if she didn’t lose weight. So the 21-stone 6lbs mother-of-two went to her local Slimming World in Blyth, Northumberland, and slowly but surely the rest of her family followed. Lynda and husband Les Kidd pictured before the family went on the junk food-free diet . Now with a healthier outlook, and trimmer waists, mother and father Lynda and Les, son David and daughter Lisa are looking to the future. Full-time mother Lisa said: 'The doctor had suggested I get a gastric band but with the kids I couldn’t go for the surgery so I decided to do it on my own. 'I really needed to do something about my weight, I was in a lot of pain. I wanted to get healthy for my children as it was affecting them as I couldn’t do anything with them and they were suffering.' David Kidd, son of Les and Lynda, pictured before his diet, cut out junk food and alcohol in effort to lose weight . Lisa took her mother, Lynda, 56, along to the first Slimming World class and the weight began to fell off straight away, with Lisa losing seven pounds in the first week. And impressed by their success, 36-year-old David decided to give Slimming World a go. Mother-of-two Lynda Kidd pictured before her whole family shed 25 stone . David, who was a keen sportsman before a back injury kept him off the football pitch said: 'I was 20 stone and 9lbs, my heaviest, when I started. 'I had thought of doing it before, but I thought it was for ladies. 'It was the best decision I ever made going along. My weight was affecting my lifestyle, I was out of breath and could not exercise. 'I am happy with what I am now, 13 stone 9lbs, but ideally I would like to get my BMI down to 25 and that would be losing another nine pounds. 'But it’s great, I can shop in High Street stores and don’t need to go to large men’s outlets. 'I have been back playing five-a-side and I can go down to the gym.' Retired Co-op worker Les, 58, soon . joined his family after seeing David’s success and so far has dropped . from 21 stone to 15 stone 7lbs. Lynda said: 'It just took a little longer for us to get him there, he thought he was OK. 'It took a bit of bullying to get him there. 'Now . he has so much more energy and he has been able to stop taking some of . his tablets like the ones for really high blood pressure, . Now . a year-and-a-half after their first class, Lisa has slimmed down to 11 . stone 4lbs, while Lynda has dropped from 13 stone 5lbs to 10 stone 5lbs. Lynda . said: 'I joined at the same time as Lisa because of her health issues . and I wanted to support her, she needed someone to be there for her. 'It was not until I started losing weight that I realised how big I was. 'I thought I am putting on weight, but it doesn’t matter at my age, but I was at my heaviest ever.'

Elegant: Ri Sol-ju, the wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, dressed in her smart trouser suit for a tour of a tile factory in Pyongyang . The First Lady of North Korea has caused another stir among watchers of the Stalinist regime by eschewing convention to step out in a stylish trouser suit. Former pop star Ri Sol-ju, wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, wore the stylish black trouser suit during a visit to the Taedonggang tile factory in Pyongyang. Most residents of the city, the country's capital, only ever wear drab coloured Mao-style suits and North Korean women generally dress only in conservative skirts. Ms Ri's appearance in the unconventional outfit comes just weeks after she was pictured at an event with what looked like a luxurious Dior evening pouch. The appearance of Ms Ri, who is thought to be in her 20s, was enough of a fashion statement to incite comment over the border in South Korea, the Daily Telegraph reported. South Korea's Yonhap news agency noted that female officials in the North are rarely seen in trousers. Ms Ri's elegant appearances in national media are seen as a sign that Kim is trying to raise the country's aspirations. The country of 24 million has suffered severe food shortages since a famine in the mid-1990s killed hundreds of thousands, but the state's totalitarian rulers have copious personal wealth and are said to live a lavish lifestyle. It is unclear whether the bag is genuine or an imitation, but South . Korea's Joong Ang Ilbo newspaper said it would cost 1.8 million . won (£1,017) in the capital, Seoul. Glamorous twenty-something Ri Sol-Ju has sparked intense media interest since she was unveiled as the wife of 28-year-old Supreme Leader in July this year. A former pop singer, the attractive . young woman has been photographed in a range of chic yet conservative . outfits which recall the lady-like style of Kate Middleton or Carla . Bruni. Contrast: Ms Ri's appearance is out of sync with her companions on the factory tour. North Koreans tend to dress sombrely, with women in particular expected to wear conservative skirts . Luxury: Ri Sol-Ju, wife of North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un, has been pictured sporting what appears to be a Christian Dior handbag . Real or fake? The handbag appears to be a Dior evening pouch (pictured) The picture which revealed her costly . bag was released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency earlier this month, . and was taken as the leader and his wife visited a unit of the . Korean People's Army. In contrast to his wife, Kim was clad in his customary Mao-style dark suit. Ms Ri has previously been snapped in a red polka dot jacket, black dress and somewhat nervous smile while attending the opening of an amusement park. At the completion ceremony of the Rungna . People's Pleasure Ground, where Kim was photographed beaming on a . fairground ride and shaking hands with an octopus, she looked modest and . comfortable in a green and black dress. Contrast: North Korea's first lady brought some colour to proceedings when she visited the Rungna People's Pleasure Ground with leader Kim Jong-Un (left) Later, she appeared in an elegant black suit, side by side with her somberly dressed husband. Ms Ri's taste - and presumably, budget - for shift dresses contrasts sharply with the everyday dress of her countrywomen, which tends to reflect their position in society. While . some women favour a traditional kimono-style garment called the . Choson-ot, many wear either military uniforms or drab office-wear . reminiscent of British fashion in the Nineties.

However, recent reports suggest the Supreme Leader is following in his grandfather's footsteps by relaxing clothing rules for women. Previously they were only allowed to wear trousers while working in factories or on farms, but now skinny jeans are starting to be seen on the streets - along with high heels and earrings. According to South Korea's Yonhap . News Agency, the new Mrs Kim received etiquette training for about six . months before taking on the role of first lady. Women's clothes: Female soldiers in North Korea are immaculately turned out, while civilian women are still seen in the traditional Choson-ot (right), especially during state celebrations. When news of their union emerged, foreign intelligence agencies suggested Kim and his bride had first become romantically involved a decade ago, when he returned home from his studies at a private academy in Switzerland. It was claimed that Kim’s late father, Kim Jong-il, had ordered him to end the relationship, so that Ms Ri ended up marrying an officer in the North Korean army instead. Kim is the world's youngest ruler, and the announcement of his marriage has been seen as a bid to stress his maturity in a culture which places a high value on family life.",Ri Sol-ju's appearance in smart trouser suit comes just weeks after she was pictured with what looked like a luxury Dior hand bag .

PETA is demanding that the University of California San Francisco return a $2.1 million research grant after chilling reports of gruesome animal cruelty were uncovered. The animal rights organization's demand relates to one of countless tales of animals suffering in horrific conditions at UCSF, which has one of the largest medical . research programs in the country. Recipients of research grants are required by the National Institutes of Health to adhere to a lab animal welfare policy. Seven years ago, UCSF paid $92,500 to settle federal findings that its researchers had violated the Animal Welfare Act. Tragic: Petra the rhesus monkey endured a chronic painful infection but was still kept on a research study for two years by the UCSF . Now NIH reports which have recently become public record have revealed that incidents of animal neglect and mistreatment have persisted. Some of the worst abuses include laboratory mice having toes removed without anesthesia. Several animals - including birds and a squirrel monkey - receive little or no pain medication after surgical procedures. One primate was starved for weeks, while mice were allowed to die of thirst. Animal rights supporters complain that a $92,500 fine is lose change to the university in comparison to the research grants which bring in millions of dollars. Critics of the system argue that there is not a strong enough incentive for UCSF to improve standards. The tragic case study that has so angered PETA relates to a female monkey called Petra. Researchers studying Parkinson's disease implanted a device in Petra's skull so that gene therapy could be delivered directly to her brain. As is common practice, the screws were left in the monkey's skull when the device was removed. A squirrel monkey was found to have received little or no pain medication after surgical procedures . Monkeys and mice were amongst the animals found to have been mistreated by UCSF . Vets soon noticed that Petra . became lethargic and picked continually at the spot on her head. Over . the next two years the veterinary staff treated her with painkillers, . further surgery and even removed the screws, but the wound remained . unhealed. Only after . two years of persistent pain for Petra, did vets find that a piece of . acrylic had been left in her head since the 2008 implant. A . photo of the miserable-looking monkey, with a wide, red wound at the . top of her head was taken by federal inspector who arrived unannounced . just days after the acrylic was removed. Three week later, researchers . euthanized Petra. 'Allowing . an animal to remain on a study for almost two years while undergoing . repeated invasive treatments for chronic complications of the study is . not consistent with the intent of this section of the Animal Welfare . Act,' the inspector wrote. UCSF has one of the largest medical research programs in the country . 'Keeping an animal on study under these circumstances does not avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, or pain to that animal.' The inspector also cited UCSF for failing to remove foreign material, a violation of the research protocol. Although the university says its study led to a clinical trial now under way, the inspector made it clear that Petra should not have been involved once her distress was evident. 'There are many thousands of animals suffering every day, and on top of that, you have UCSF failing to provide many of them with adequate veterinary care when they're sick,' said Justin Goodman of PETA, which is calling on the National Institutes of Health to force UCSF to return the $2.1 million grant that funded the study in which Petra was involved. UCSF has one of the largest medical research programs in the country and relies on hundreds of thousands of animals as its researchers try to develop treatments for diseases of all kinds. UCSF said it takes the care and use of the animals it studies very seriously and tests on animals are a last result . The USDA enforces the Animal Welfare Act at research institutions around the country, usually with one unannounced visit a year. The inspectors look for violations, which can trigger a second unannounced visit to see if they're fixed. 'The university takes very seriously the care and use of the animals it studies, beginning with ensuring that as few animals as possible are used in research,' spokeswoman Barbara French told the San Francisco Chronicle. She said UCSF uses computer models and cultured cells for research if it can. If those won't work, researchers turn to animals.

Hospitals and care homes will be given Ofsted-style ratings in a move by Jeremy Hunt, pictured . Hospitals and care homes will be given Oftsed-style ratings as part of a major drive to root out ‘bog-standard’ performance in the NHS. Jeremy Hunt will pledge an overhaul of the current inspection regime, which he says promotes poor care as it gives institutions little incentive to improve. The Health Secretary has acted after being ‘appalled’ by last week’s report from the Care Quality Commission watchdog, which found standards so poor that one in five care homes do not even feed residents properly. He wants people to be able to easily access the new ratings on an official website, allowing them to choose their hospital or care home by comparing them with others. The Health Secretary will announce the overhaul in a speech at the King’s Fund in London tomorrow. Mr Hunt believes the current system - under which trusts and care homes are merely told whether or not they meet certain ‘minimum standards’ - can encourage a ‘tick box mentality’ which leads to poor care. He believes it can discourage complacent managers from continuing to improve standards once they have passed the minimum bar. This failure to root out poor care contributed to the failings at the Mid Staffordshire trust, where hundreds died in a filthy A&E department, he says. The plan is to replace these minimum standards with a grading system similar to Ofsted’s, which ranks schools ‘inadequate’, ‘satisfactory’, ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’. No decision has yet been taken on whether these are the ratings which will be used - that will only be taken following a consultation. But Mr Hunt said some sort of grading system is essential to encourage managers to raise their game in an attempt to achieve a higher ranking - for the good of patients. The Health Secretary will announce the overhaul in a speech tomorrow. He will say: ‘The public knows how well each school in their area is doing thanks to independent and thorough Ofsted inspections. But because the CQC only measures whether minimum standards have been reached, they do not know the same about their hospitals and care homes. A report found standards so poor that a fifth of care homes do not even feed residents properly (file photo) ‘Given the scale of some of the problems we’re uncovering in care provision, it’s now clear it was a big mistake by Labour to abolish star ratings in 2008. In doing so they not only deprived the public of vital information, they abolished the pressure for a constant, relentless improvement in standards. ‘There may have been problems with the way the assessments were done, the people who did them, their timeliness or their accuracy. ‘But the principle - that there should be an easy to understand, independent and expert assessment of how well somewhere is doing - is correct. And essential if we are to drive up standards.’ Last week, a report by the CQC found that thousands of elderly people are suffering poor and unsafe care in hospitals and nursing homes. Fifteen per cent of hospitals and 20 per cent of care homes failed to meet minimum standards on ensuring residents had enough food and drink, and the help they needed to consume it. Ten per cent of NHS hospitals and 15 per cent of nursing homes failed to meet standards on treating patients with dignity and respect. A source close to Mr Hunt said: ‘Jeremy was appalled by what he read in the CQC report. He wants a new system which will help drive up care standards.’ Under the plans, there will be separate ratings for each individual care home, and probably for individual hospital departments rather than the whole institution. This will enable patients to know that while a hospital’s cardiology unit may be good, its maternity wards may be poor. It is envisaged that the information will be available in an easily-accessible format, perhaps on the website of the CQC.",Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will pledge overhaul of current inspection regime after being 'appalled'

Male nurse Neil Riley, 54, was found dead at his home in Great Harwood, Lancashire . A male nurse at one Britain’s most prestigious Catholic boarding schools has been found hanged after he was accused of being a peeping tom. Neil Riley, 54, had been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism after claims he set up hidden cameras in a bedroom to spy on female colleagues. Staff at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, where boarding school fees cost up to £28,443 per year, called police after it was believed four women had been secretly filmed. Mr Riley was later questioned and released on bail but five days later he was found dead at his home in Great Harwood, Blackburn, following concerns for his welfare. Lancashire Police today said inquiries were still ongoing into whether any offences had been committed against the staff. Officers are studying a computer seized from Mr Riley’s home to check for any files which may contain film footage of the college. It is feared up to two secret cameras may have been used to film the unwitting women getting undressed. Det Insp Claire Holbrook said: 'We can confirm that a 54-year-old man was arrested at his home on Sunday, November 11, on suspicion of voyeurism after concerns were raised by staff at Stonyhurst College. 'The man was a non-teaching member of staff who was employed as a nurse. He was bailed pending an examination of the cameras seized, and other computer equipment. 'On the evening of Friday, November 16, officers sadly found the man deceased at his home. There are no suspicious circumstances. His family are aware. There is still an on-going police investigation.' She added: 'There is no suggestion any of the children at the college have been in any way physically abused by this man. I have no suspicion, or evidence, to link this individual to other offenders. Investigation: Mr Riley's death came just days after he was arrested over claims he set up a hidden camera in a bedroom to spy on female colleagues at the £28,000-a-year Stonyhurst College . Allegations: An investigation was launched at Stonyhurst College two weeks ago after staff reported concerns about Mr Riley's behaviour . 'Clearly, because of the tragic circumstances which followed the arrest, this man will never face court proceedings. 'It must be understood at this stage Mr Riley had not been convicted. 'We will work closely with the college to identify any offences committed, any persons who may be victims, ensure that they are safeguarded, and offered any support or counselling that may be required.' Mr Riley joined the college as a nurse in 2005 and was involved in the college’s combined cadet force, where he was recently promoted to captain. Mr Riley joined Stonyhurst as a nurse and was involved in the college's combined cadet force . An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned until January 29. A Stonyhurst College spokesman said: 'Concerns were raised two weeks ago by other staff about Mr Riley, a member of the nursing staff at Stonyhurst. 'It was thought he may have set up a hidden camera in a staff bedroom for voyeuristic reasons. As soon as the concern was raised, Mr Riley was sent home and the police were asked to investigate. The college has also informed social services of this. 'Sadly Mr Riley was found dead at home by the Police on Friday 16th November. 'We understand the police have still to conclude their investigation, and we are co-operating with them fully. 'Staff, parents and pupils have been made aware, and we have offered support to those who have been upset by it. We have also been in touch with the family of Mr Riley to offer our support.' Stonyhurst College - whose French motto, Quant Je Puis means 'As Much as I Can' - is a coeducational Roman Catholic independent school, adhering to the Jesuit tradition and was founded in 1593. Former old boys include Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of Sherlock Holmes, England rugby star Kyran Bracken and Mark Thompson, former Director General of the BBC. In 1998 a Jesuit priest who sexually abused four pupils aged between 12 and 16 while a maths teacher at the school between 1987 and 1995 was jailed for five years. The sentence was reduced to three years on appeal. At the time of his trial the Catholic Society of Jesus blamed a breakdown in communication for their failure to take heed of warnings about the priest’s behaviour while abroad. Before being convicted, the Jesuits had sent him to Canada for psychiatric treatment and he later went to Our Lady of Victory, in Gloucestershire, the retreat where fallen priests from the UK and the Irish Republic are sent.

A teaching assistant has been handed a staggering £800,000 in compensation after she tripped and dislocated a finger at work. The payout – one of the highest ever awarded in education  – was made after Julie Anne Huddart tripped over the waist strap of an empty wheelchair while trying to move it. Mrs Huddart, 49, dislocated a finger and injured her elbow in the 2003 accident, and has since been diagnosed with ‘reflex sympathetic dystrophy’ – a malfunction of the nervous system that causes pain and swelling. Mrs Huddart's lawyer explained that she had been left in constant pain with severely restricted movement down the left side of her body.  She is now dependent on the care of her husband. Astronomical: Lancashire County Council had to pay out £1.3 million in school compensation claims in just one year . The married teaching assistant, from . Chorley, Lancashire, began a nine-year battle against her local . authority for compensation, and earlier this year Lancashire County . Council agreed to pay £800,000 in damages and £140,000 in legal costs in . an out-of-court settlement. The award, which sparked fury among . war veterans and victims of crime who received substantially less for . their injuries, is part of a burgeoning compensation culture among . teachers who last year claimed a record £25million following accidents . and employment disputes. Recent payouts include £200,000 for slipping on a grape and £173,595 for dislocating an ankle during playground duty. A teacher who preferred to take small . classes was handed £250,000 after being put in front of a full class, . including disruptive pupils, which caused a recurrence of a nervous . breakdown. Unbelievable: Jessica Knight, pictured, was initially awarded just £18,895 after being left for dead in a frenzied knife attack. Her mother Jill Walmsley said the teaching assistant's award was 'astronomical' Yet classroom unions which helped . secure the payouts have been vocal in their attacks on spiralling . compensation claims from parents who resort to lawyers when their . children fall in the playground or have accidents on school trips. Lancashire council leader Geoff Driver said yesterday the award was a ‘sad reflection on the litigious society we have become’. Jill Walmsley, the mother of a . teenager who was stabbed 35 times and left for dead in a frenzied . unprovoked attack in 2010, condemned the payout. Jessica Knight, now 16, suffered . injuries so severe she suffered a stroke and was in a coma for weeks. But the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority – which can offer . victims up to £250,000 – awarded her just £18,895. The family appealed . and received a larger payout, but it was still ‘substantially’ less than . the award to Mrs Huddart. Ms Walmsley, from Chorley, . Lancashire, said: ‘Jess didn’t even get a quarter of that sum. It is . unbelievable, astronomical. Something that can change your life for ever . gets a measly sum.’ War hero Dave Watson, who lost both . legs and his right arm in a bomb blast in Afghanistan, added: ‘It is bad . because we are going out there and our lives can change just like that. It is unfair – we are doing a more dangerous job.’ Mrs Huddart’s payout was one of 12 to . school staff in Lancashire alone last year, costing taxpayers more than . £1.3million. Other payments included £42,000 to a teacher who pushed a . door which did not open, resulting in concussion and an arm injury. The . council also had to pay £26,713 in costs. Figures from the three main classroom . unions show they secured £25million in compensation for members last . year. Most of the cash was paid out following employment disputes, but . there were also significant personal injury payouts, including £158,000 . for slipping on mud during a fire drill. Many cases never reached court but . were settled using ‘compromise agreements’ – legal agreements to accept . compensation rather than pursue a tribunal claim. Employment payouts included £33,000 . to a teacher who was fired for gross misconduct amid allegations she . falsified test results, albeit in optional tests. The school ‘failed to . provide any evidence the member’s actions had been deliberate’. In another case, a teacher with . serious criminal convictions dating back 20 years – before she started . teaching – was fired after the local council discovered the offences. A . tribunal awarded her £35,500. The growing payouts culture is . thought to be partly driven by schools and local authorities settling . out of court to minimise their losses, sometimes without properly . investigating the claims. And the size and number of payouts have . prompted accusations of double standards after unions criticised . litigious parents. In the past, the NASUWT union has . lamented that ‘society no longer appears to accept the concept of a . genuine accident’ and condemned the ‘rise of the blame culture’. It is believed Mrs Huddart has been . unable to work since the accident. She lives with husband Aled and two . children from a previous marriage in a £200,000 semi-detached home in a . residential estate. Lancashire County Council said the . cost to the authority was £100,000 – the rest was covered by its . employer’s liability insurance. Mr Driver added: ‘We contested this case but liability was decided by the courts. ‘It is a sad reflection on the . litigious society we have become. There seems to be no such thing as an . accident any more; everything is argued to be someone’s fault.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Every penny spent on settling these claims means less . money spent on educating children.’ The compensation details were released as part of a Freedom of Information request.","Was one of 12 payouts to school staff in Lancashire that cost taxpayers       £1.3 million in one year .

Jailed: Ashley Anderson is accused of having sexual contact with four of her students . A former math teacher in north-central Iowa has pleaded not guilty to allegations that she had sexual contact with four teenage students. Ashley Anderson, 24, of Ackley, could face trial as soon as January 15. Anderson has been charged with four felony counts of sexual exploitation by a school employee. Each carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Anderson has resigned from her job as a math teacher at Aplington-Parkersburg High School. A criminal complaint in Butler County says Anderson sent nude photographs of herself to the students and had sexual contact with them, including intercourse with one, according to The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. She also performed oral sex on three other students, according to the complaint. The boys ranged in age from 16 to 18, and court records say the alleged incidents occurred during the 2011-12 school year. Police said they received information that Anderson had sexually abused a teen who confided in a friend at the high school.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:12 EST, 27 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:15 EST, 27 November 2012 . Nadine Dorries returned to Heathrow yesterday sporting her jungle hat from I'm A Celebrity . Nadine Dorries will not be reinstated as a Tory MP unless she apologises for taking part in I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here, it emerged today. The Mid Bedfordshire MP was summoned to a meeting with Conservative Chief Whip Sir George Young where she was expected to explain her decision to abandon Parliament for the Australian jungle. She has been told to ‘rebuild bridges’ with angry colleagues, but party insiders say there is little prospect of her returning to the Conservative benches any time soon. After the 15-minute chat, Ms Dorries said she was confident of having the Tory whip restored, and claimed being an MP was not a job but a 'life choice. She also criticised a Labour MP who had only attended two thirds of Commons votes, despite him undergoing heart surgery. David Cameron is understood to be backing Sir George in insisting that if she fails to show any remorse for taking part in the reality TV she will not have the party whip restored. The Prime Minister has made clear his unhappiness with her decision to swap Parliament for the jungle, and Ms Dorries has used TV interviews since being kicked out of the reality show to claim she has been a victim of Downing Street briefings against her. She has also claimed she would ‘do it again tomorrow’ and used Twitter to attack ‘the snobs’ who have criticised her. A spokesman for Sir George said today: 'The whip has not been restored and nor will it be until she proves that she can rebuild bridges with her constituents, her association and her parliamentary colleagues.' But it is not thought likely that Ms Dorries will be able to persuade Sir George to reistate her. ‘There is nothing to suggest she is going to get the whip back,’ said a senior Conservative source. ‘She has been told to rebuild bridges, but she has not got brilliant history on that. 'You would think that with everything that has gone on, she would be contrite but on the contrary she is saying she would do it again. I don’t think anyone in their right mind would look at Nadine’s response since she came back and not be quite flabbergasted.' Ms Dorries had claimed she wanted to reach out to voters through the TV series, but she became the first celebrity to be dumped out of the jungle . The Mid Bedfordshire MP used Twitter to express her alarm at the media scrum as she arrived back in Britain, and defended taking time off from Westminster . Ms Dorries was suspended from the Tory party after flying to Australia earlier this month. She claims to have had permission to take time off from Westminster from then-Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell but admits she did not tell him it was to take part in the show. She claims that other MPs have also taken long spells away from Westminster. She attacked Labour MP Stephen McCabe on . Twitter for reporting her to the standards commissioner, telling him his . own attendance rate was just 63 per cent. But he responded, pointing out that he had taken time off to recover from having open heart surgery. Mr McCabe wrote on Twitter: 'Imagine equating time off for open heart surgery with a paid for holiday on a reality TV show. Says all we need to know.' But Ms Dorries was unrepentant, replying: 'I think with your 63% attendance record, you should be quiet. Obvioulsy been taking a few holidays of your own!' Speaking after the meeting with Sir George, Ms Dorries said she was confident that the party whip would be restored. Sir George Young arrived at Number 10 Downing Street for this morning's Cabinet meeting before his meeting with Ms Dorries . 'I think we will be fine with the . whip,' she told BBC Three Counties Radio. 'We had a very good-natured, a . very happy meeting. We have adjourned the meeting and we are . reconvening this time next week, if not before.' Ms Dorries insisted that she wanted to . carry on in Parliament. 'Of course I want to be an MP. 'An MP is not . doing a job, it is a life choice. If I didn't want to make that life . choice I wouldn't be doing it, I can assure you.' This week Ms Dorries claimed to have missed only three parliamentary days, despite the Commons sitting 11 times while she was away. She insisted she would 'do it again tomorrow' as she was confronted by paparazzi photographers at Heathrow yesterday after viewers made her the first contestant to be booted of the show. It is thought a major factor in deciding her fate will be the response from people in Mid Bedfordshire. A poll in her constituency carried out while she was still in the jungle revealed almost 60 per cent of Conservatives ‘disapprove’ of her decision to abandon Parliament. Asked to rate how they feel about Miss Dorries, ranked from 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘extremely negative’, she scored just 2.82, while 58 per cent said David Cameron was right to suspend her.Just 8 per cent said they were now more likely to vote for her. Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, who commissioned the survey, said: ‘Nadine said she was doing the show for the chance to talk to a huge audience about important questions, at a time when nobody pays attention to politicians. Unfortunately, her constituents are not buying this.’ However, Ms Dorries says she has received hundreds of supportive emails and messages on Twitter, claiming the media reaction to her absence has been 'slightly hysterical'. Ms Dorries said: 'I think my constituents have been fed a huge line. This how I have chosen to spend my holiday and this is what I've chosen to do. When MPs go on holiday they switch their phones off. 'I think there has been a slightly hysterical reaction. 'I think that some of the attention that I am receiving is to do with people thinking I'm going to go to another party, but I'm not. Just because I'm critical of Cameron it doesn't mean I'm about to defect,' she told the Bedford Times & Citizen. 'What the time in the jungle has meant is that no-one doesn't know who Nadine Dorries is in terms of being an MP,' she added. The Mid Bedfordshire MP claimed she wanted to use her appearance on I'm A Celebrity to discuss political issues in front of a TV audience of millions . Tory strategists were appalled at pictures of Mr Dorries sunbathing at a time when constituents are struggling to make ends meet back home in Britain . 'When I speak out about subjects in . the future, people will know who it is that is talking about it, and I . will have more of an audience. My colleagues in Parliament say that I am . now the best-known MP in Britain.' Ms Dorries confirmed she will donate . her MP's salary for a month to local play schemes for children in her . constituency, and insisted that reports of her fee from I'm A Celebrity - . widely estimated at £40,000 - are 'massively exaggerated'. The Mid Bedfordshire MP claimed she . wanted to use her appearance on I'm A Celebrity to discuss political . issues, including lowering the abortion limit, in front of a TV audience . of millions. But none of the political conversations were aired. Instead she was seen eating an ostrich anus and camel toe in a Bushtucker Trial and performing a series of bad jokes with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather. Budge Wells, deputy chairman of the Mid-Beds Conservative Association, said a meeting about 'how to move on' from the row will be held next week. He said: 'We will, of course, invite Nadine Dorries to the meeting and we will listen to what she has to say. Hopefully we can come to a conclusion as to how to move on. 'She needs to establish a rapport with the constituency. I don’t want to pre-empt anything until we have listened to her.' He said the local party office had received several emails about Ms Dorries’ TV appearance. 'Most of the emails are not praising her for what she has done,' he added. 'It’s been a very difficult time for everybody.' Mr Cameron is understood to be determined to send a clear message to other Tory MPs his unhappiness at her decision to swap Parliament for the Australian jungle. Before flying home, she took a swipe at critics in her own party, claiming female MPs who condemned her for abandoning her constituents were fuelled by ‘jealousy’. Last Thursday, when the Commons was debating women bishops, giving prisoners the vote and welfare reform, Ms Dorries was pictured going down a slide with Linda Robson, Charlie Brooks and Ashley Roberts . Instead of taking part in Commons debates, the Mid Bedfordshire MP was seen chatting with former darts champion Eric Bristow . In an interview before flying home, Ms Dorries was unrepentant when asked if she thought she would be frozen out on her return to Westminster. ‘Do I care? Why would I know? Why would I be interested in that? The word jealousy springs to mind actually,’ she told Iain Dale on LBC 97.3. ‘I know what’s happened. A lot of MPs including the female MPs, and the female MPs I’ve been told are the critical ones are the jobless and the more ambitious.’ VIDEO: Bullish Nadine Dorries returns to Britain - and a media scrum .","Mid Bedfordshire MP summoned to showdown meeting at 10.30am .

Jim Gaynor, 57, who bled to death at his home in Gateshead just days after undergoing surgery for throat cancer . A grandfather who bled to death just days after undergoing surgery for throat cancer was not warned of the dangers of the treatment, an inquest has heard. Jim Gaynor, 57, a learning disabilities nurse, suffered from catastrophic bleeding and drowned in his own blood following transoral laser surgery to remove a tumour in his throat. A leading doctor told an inquest that any future patients considering the surgery would be warned of the danger of bleeding to death afterwards. His grieving family have questioned how doctors were unaware about the risk previously. His daughter Ami, 26, a nurse, . said: 'It was positive to hear that doctors are already looking to make . changes, but my only concern is how nobody seemed to know about this . risk of death before. 'Why had nobody looked into it? Why did it take my dad to die for these changes to be made?' The inquest heard that Mr Gaynor had a 5cm by . 4cm ulcer at the left side base of his tongue, where his throat tumour . had been removed, which had 'eroded' a branch of the carotid artery, . causing catastrophic bleeding. Leading an inquest into the death, Coronor David Mitford said he had not heard any evidence to suggest the transoral laser surgery Mr Gaynor had five days before was not properly carried out. But rejecting the conclusions of a post mortem examination, which said the death was due to 'natural causes', he said the operation, and an ulcer it caused, were 'inextricably linked' to what happened. Mr Mitford ruled that Mr Gaynor, from Gateshead, died as the result of the 'unexpected consequences of a necessary operation.' Surgeon James O'Hara told the inquest that since Mr Gaynor's death he had spoken to colleagues around the UK about what happened, and discovered patients in Liverpool and London had suffered the same fate. He said he now tells all patients set to undergo transoral laser surgery that there is a chance they could bleed to death afterwards. But Mr Gaynor's grieving family have now questioned why he had to die before medics could recognise the dangers of the surgery- six years after doctors in Australia highlighted the risks. The family point to articles written by cancer doctors in Melbourne, Australia, as long ago as 2006 in which they warned that severe bleeding could occur up to a fortnight later. Mr Gaynor first felt a lump in his throat around Christmas last year and went to see his GP. Sisters Ashlee Gaynor, left, and Ami Jackson, right, who have questioned why their father had to die before changes were made in which doctors now tell patients about the risk of bleeding to death following transoral laser surgery . After initially being told it was probably just a swollen gland, he was eventually referred for further investigations, first at Dunston Hill Hospital in Gateshead, then the Freeman in Newcastle and eventually Sunderland Royal Hospital. In February, he was diagnosed with cancer and underwent a neck dissection to remove the lump, which was seen as a success, and offered either chemotherapy and radiotherapy or transoral laser surgery to try and remove any remaining cancer. Ami added: 'He decided to go with the transoral because the people he'd spoken to having radio and chemo were quite poorly, and he went in for it on April 4, four days after his 57th birthday. 'When he was discharged on April 8, which was a Sunday, my uncle noticed he was coughing in the car on the way home. 'He went to bed because he was quite tired, then got up and drove mum to work the next day. 'My sister Ashlee came home in the afternoon and a friend was there who had popped to see him. 'She could see his neck was really swollen, like he had tonsillitis, but at the time he didn't think anything of it. 'He started to cough, so my sister told him to go to the kitchen if he was going to bring up phlegm. 'He coughed up a massive clot of blood and started to gush like a fountain. Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where Mr Gaynor was pronounced dead following severe bleeding from the mouth . 'He was hysterical and ran out into the garden, panicking and scared, saying ""I'm going to die"" and ""Help me"".' An ambulance was called, but by the time paramedics arrived Jim's heart had already stopped. He was taken to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where he was pronounced dead. Ami said: 'There was no dignity in his death. He knew he was dying and had to stand and watch it happening. 'I can't imagine what it must have been like. 'My mum Karen couldn't even go to the funeral because she was so traumatised by what happened. 'We had to stay with her for a fortnight because we were so worried. She didn't eat for about three weeks. 'When she turned 50 last month she said she didn't want a thing, not even a card. She didn't want to know because to her it just meant that she's got another 30 years without dad.' Mr O'Hara told the inquest that there was nothing the family could have done to save Jim once the bleed started. He said: 'If he had been in hospital, in close proximity to a head and neck surgeon - as nobody else would have been able to do it, not a nurse or a junior doctor - then possibly. 'Even then the chance would have been very slim.' Ami said she felt like she was 'living in hell' since the keen golfer, a member of Stocksfield Golf Club, died and that his death had been particularly hard for her young son, Dylan. She said: 'They were very close. 'Dad always wanted a boy and when I had Dylan he doted on him. He's only four and now he's going to grow up without his grandad. 'I've tried to work out what went wrong, but can't and it makes me really furious.

During the car chase, the pair screeched into Mason's Hill, a side road by Bromley Police Station, not realising it was a dead end. No through road: Bromley police station is situated on a dead-end road, much to the misfortune of the fleeing youths . The pair leapt out of the car and dashed into Bromley Police Station, which is open 24 hours a day, looking 'flustered and confused', according to front office staff. Police then arrested them. A police spokesman said officers started chasing the car after it was reported stolen from nearby Petts Wood in the early hours of Saturday and failed to stop. The car chase around Mottingham and Bromley came to an abrupt halt at the police station when the pair ditched the car. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Furphy from Bromley Police said; ""To say we were surprised by their choice of attempted escape route is an understatement.

The mother of the Colorado teen that has been missing for a week, says she suspects her ex-husband could be involved in the boy's disappearance. Dylan Redwine, 13, vanished the Monday before Thanksgiving while he was spending the day with his father Mark in Vallecito, during a court ordered visit. But his mother, Elaine Redwine, says she fears her ex-husband could have done something to drastic, as they argued over custody of the boy. 'I was married to Mark for a lot of years, and I know the way he reacts to things,' she told ABC News. 'If Dylan maybe did or said something that wasn't what Mark wanted to hear, I'm just afraid of how Mark would have reacted,' she added. The couple are divorced and and the mother believes her husband was angry that she was appointed the boy's primary custodian. 'I don't think Mark treats him very well,' Elaine Redwine said. 'I would not put it past Mark to have done something to remove Dylan from the situation. You know, like 'if I can't have him, nobody will.""' Scuba divers have now been enlisted to search for the missing 13-year-old boy who disappeared during a court-ordered visit with his father. The biggest break in the case came when police dogs traced the boy’s scent to the edge of Vallecito Lake, but the scuba teams failed to find any further clues during their search on Sunday. They will continue through Monday using boats equipped with sonar tools that will help scan the depths of the lake. Dylan lives full-time in Colorado Springs with his mother and brothers but was in Vallecito to spend time with his father at the time of his disappearance. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scent: Police dogs picked up the trace of an unidentified scent during their search for Dylan but it only extended to the water's edge so they are now using scuba teams with sonar equipment to help . His mother Elaine says Dylan was unhappy about having to make the trip, but that he would not have run away from home. 'Dylan . wouldn't have left willingly,' Elaine Redwine said on Friday during an . interview at the home of a friend. 'If there was any way to communicate . he would have called.' The . boy's father Mark Redwine told investigators he last saw his son on . Monday morning around 7.30am before leaving the home to run errands. He said his son was gone when he returned four hours later. A . neighbor who knows Dylan told police he saw the boy walking along a . road in Vallecito the afternoon he went missing but thought nothing of . it until hearing the police reports. In addition to the scuba team checking the lake, police are still pursuing other options, including a scenario where Dylan ran away from home with the help of a friend. Local station KMGH reports that a postal worker saw a boy matching Dylan’s description walking in Vallecita with another boy about his age. His childhood friends from Bayfield, which is just over 20 miles from the area where Dylan's father lives, suggested an alternative theory that police are also looking into. They believe that Dylan may have tried hitchhiking to go see them in his old hometown, during which he was abducted. Police say they haven't ruled out foul play. Break from family: Dylan's mother admits that her son didn't want to be . with his father over the break while a neighbor reported seeing him . walking around hours after missing . 'We know some people are upset that we are even considering the possibility that Dylan may have run away. But we are working for Dylan and we owe it to him and to his family to consider every possible scenario that could have caused him to drop out of sight for a week,’ Dan Bender, La Plata Sheriff's office spokesman told KMGH. The missing boy is 5 feet tall, weighing 105 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and fair complexion. He was last seen wearing a blue-and-white Duke Blue Devils baseball cap, black Nike T-shirt and black Jordan tennis shoes. Dylan was picked up Sunday by his father at Durango-La Plata County Airport, his mother said on Friday. Dylan announced his arrival in a text message and ended it with an emoticon expressing a scowl, she said. Search: Dylan's friends believe that he may have tried hitchhiking to a nearby town to visit them . ‘I don't know if you can see this and I know you're not a big reader, so I will keep this short. We are all in Durango looking for you. I AM HERE and I will never give up looking for you. You are my ray of sunshine and the best kid a mother could ever have,’ she wrote in a Facebook post. Mrs Redwine added that the boy's father rarely exercises his right to see his own son, and she added that it would be out of character for Dylan to suddenly want to take a walk in the woods. 'Dylan is a generational kid and tech savvy,' she said. 'He wouldn't have gone to the mountains to pitch a tent or build a fire.' Mr Bender said that the search expanded on Saturday morning to include Bayfield, a town south of Vallecito. ‘I think that anyone who has a child can understand how devastated the family is,’ said La Plata sheriff Duke Schirard. ‘There's always hope until facts prove otherwise,’ he told the station.

The health watchdog has been forced to take action against a hospital trust which performed a surgery on the wrong patient. Within a month, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust performed four botched surgeries, including leaving instruments inside two patients and performing surgery on the wrong person. Surgeons also operated on the wrong part of the body of another patient, the watchdog Monitor said. The health watchdog is taking action against Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, of which Addenbrooke's Hospital (pictured) is part of . The regulator said that since September 2011, eight 'never events' - instances which are never supposed to happen - have occurred at the trust, including four between September and October last year. Monitor said it was stepping in because the trust has also failed to give cancer patients treatment in the recommended time. There has been 'successive failure' to meet healthcare targets including waiting times for cancer treatment and accident and emergency performance, the regulator said. A spokeswoman said the regulator has taken action to 'improve the quality and organisation of healthcare' for patients. Monitor said that the 'wrong person surgery' related to a patient who had the wrong surgical lens fitted. Several patients were attending the hospital for similar operations at the same time, a spokeswoman said. Hospital chairman Jane Ramsey (pictured) stressed that the Trust was determined to reverse the situation and improve performance . The wrong lens was fitted to the wrong patient and then quickly removed - the patient did not suffer any ill effects, a spokeswoman said. The watchdog has also raised concerns about the trust's financial performance and the board's capacity. Monitor's managing director of provider regulation Stephen Hay said: ""This is not the first time we have called the Trust in to explain itself. ""We are disappointed that the Board has not resolved these issues. We note the trust has a new chair and will shortly appoint a new chief executive. We expect them to demonstrate they are getting the trust back on track as quickly as possible.' The trust, which runs Addenbrooke's and the Rosie hospital, has been ordered to commission a governance and effectiveness review.  A board level 'experienced turnaround expert' should also be appointed, Monitor recommended. Chairman Jane Ramsey stressed that the Trust was determined to reverse the situation and improve performance. She said: 'We take Monitor's concerns very seriously and we are determined to reverse the situation as soon as possible. 'My top priority, as the new chairman, will be to get to grips with these performance issues with my team and we will be setting up a task force to swiftly get back on track. 'We will be focusing on turning this trust around, so once more we can be justifiably proud of our record as one of the leading trusts in the country. 'We are working to improve our performance on meeting targets every month but we know we could do better. We are treating more people than ever before and our health outcomes are amongst the best in the country. 'I am committed to retaining this achievement but also to meeting the standards that are required. Our priority remains the care of our patients - they are at the heart of everything we do.'","Within a month, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust performed four botched surgeries .

Mother-of-three Claire Mosby, pictured leaving court yesterday, is facing a lengthy prison sentence for stealing from school funds . A gambling addict is facing prison after she stole more than £30,000 from a safe at the school where she was a governor. Claire Mosby, 38, took the dinner money from Swarcliffe Primary School, Leeds, over a two year period while she was an office manager. She was found guilty of stealing £31,000 that was collected from parents for dinners, breakfast, after school clubs and trips. Leeds Crown Court heard that mother-of-three Mosby had a gambling addiction and she used the funds to feed her habit as well as pay off debts. Bank records showed that she spent money on gambling and bingo websites and there were cash withdrawals from and ATM near to a branch of Mecca Bingo. As an 'act of leniency', Mosby was released until after Christmas and will be sentenced in the New Year. Judge Christopher Batty warned her that she faces a 'significant' prison sentence. Suspicions were first raised when Kate Davison, a school finance officer from the local authority, raised concerns over low income levels in the dinner money account. She tried to meet Mosby, a former governor at the school, but over a period of months she was 'obstructive'. Finally Ms Davison discovered a £17,000 shortfall and Mosby was unable to explain the gap in the school's finances. In March last year a search of a safe was carried out and envelopes with Mosby's handwriting were found to have money missing. More than £30,000 went missing from a safe at Swarcliffe Primary School in Leeds, West Yorkshire . She was suspended and later admitted taking loans from doorstep lenders. During the trial Mosby claimed she was afraid to report cash going missing from a safe as she would be putting the headteacher Susan Sanderson under suspicion. Giving evidence, Mosby told the jury: 'I thought people would think it was me. I thought if I reported it I was accusing Susan Sanderson of taking it.' The court heard Mosby spent around £2,000 pounds on gaming websites during the period the alleged theft took place. Mosby said she sometimes went to Mecca bingo with her husband or would enjoy playing at home online.","Claire Mosby was office manager and former school governor .

The owner of a tiny B&B in the Outer Hebrides has dropped his landmark action against the world’s largest travel website. Richard Gollin feared he would rack up thousands of pounds in legal bills if he pursued the case against internet giant Tripadvisor. Mr Gollin, 64, launched his historic claim after guests cancelled their bookings on the strength of reviews posted on the website. Case dropped: Richard Gollin, Hebridean guesthouse owner in Scotland, who started legal proceedings against Tripadvisor . Disgruntled guests claimed rooms were dirty or cold, and described their host variously as ‘pompous, arrogant and incredibly rude’. While Mr Gollin accepted genuine criticism, he claimed that some of the reviews were ‘malicious and factually inaccurate’. And because the US-owned website refused to remove them, his business was affected and he lost income. Last month Mr Gollin, who runs the eight-bedroom Baile-na-Cille guesthouse at Uig on the Isle of Lewis, began proceedings to sue the organisation, worth around £3billion, for a £2,000 loss. He had initially scored a small victory by winning the right to have the case heard in Scotland, instead of under American law as Tripadvisor wished. TripAdvisor’s solicitor Angus MacDonald originally wanted the case dealt . with under American law but eventually agreed it should be heard at . Stornoway Sheriff Court. Picturesque: Mr Gollin's bed and breakfast is located on the beautiful Isle of Lewis . He successfully argued it was 'so complex in nature' that it could only be dealt with by the ordinary sheriff court. But Mr Gollin opposed the move - saying it was a tactic by TripAdvisor to rack up legal costs to a level he could not afford. But yesterday his solicitor, Duncan Burd, confirmed the action had been dropped. He said: ‘Mr Gollin has decided not to pursue it further because of the cost implications. It could have cost thousands.’ 'We had conversations and an email from The Sheriff Principal’s office which made it clear that he did not accept the appeal because he considered the action live in the ordinary court. 'The only alternative to appeal that decision was a very complex procedure with massive expense.' The lawyer insisted that Mr Gollin had been a trailblazer over this - and not least for many others - and has certainly made his point. Poor reviews: While Richard Gollin was unhappy with some of the negative comments about his establishment on TripAdvisor, shown top, his B&B also received positive recommendations on the website, such as the five star review shown bottom . Sheriff Colin Scott Mackenzie admitted he had 'some sympathy' for Mr Gollin over the time the claim had been in the system - over six months. Although disappointed at being forced to back down, the guesthouse owner believes it will open a floodgate of cases against TripAdvisor. He revealed that he had received over 500 emails, phone calls and letters of support from people - and all but two in favour of his action. He said: 'A tiny restaurant told me that they had a bad review posted in February and it had not even opened. 'I have even had a bad review posted last month which was clearly a fake and claimed that my wife liked a drink was particularly upsetting as she is a pilot. TripAdvisor has now withdrawn that review - but not the reviews of the review.' He now hopes that TripAdvisor victims stand up against false or malicious comments that render reviews untrustworthy - yet have the power to drive hoteliers and B&B proprietors out of business.

Fiery end: The fossil, found in Turkey, is thought to be that of a large two-horned rhino once common in the Eastern Mediterranean region . The skull of a young rhino that was 'cooked to death' 9.2million years ago has been found preserved in volcanic rock in Turkey. The preserved skull, found in Turkey, is thought to have belonged to a large two-horned rhino common in the eastern Mediterranean region during that period. Unusual features of the fossil suggest the animal was baked to death in a volcanic flow similar to that which hit Pompeii in 79AD. The rhino's grisly end was near-instantaneous. 'The body was baked under a . temperature approximating 400°C, then dismembered within the pyroclastic . flow, and the skull separated from body,' researchers said. This was followed by severe . dehydration in the extreme heat of the volcanic ash, the flow of which moved . the skull about 30km north of the eruption site, where it was . discovered. Less than 2 per cent of Earth's . fossils are preserved in volcanic rock making the new find extremely . rare, according to researchers from the University of Montpellier in . France who unearthed it. Although other researchers have previously identified fossils of soft-bodied organisms preserved in volcanic ash, organic matter near an active volcanic eruption is usually quickly destroyed by the high temperatures, they said. Lead researcher Pierre-Olivier Antoine of the University of Montpellier in France told LiveScience his team found none of the rest of the rhino during their fieldwork. 'The articulated skull and mandible were found alone, and there were no other rhino bones in the surroundings, except for some rib fragments, potentially of rhino affinities,' he said.

Charged: Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore is accused of befriending and then murdering lottery winner Abraham Shakespeare . A woman accused of befriending a $30million lottery winner, swindling him of his cash and killing him began her trial for murder today. Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore, 40, allegedly became close to Florida lottery winner Abraham Shakespeare by claiming she was writing a book about him. His body was found under a concrete slab behind a home detectives say was owned by Moore's ex-boyfriend in Hillsborough County. He had been shot twice. Moore is accused of killing Shakespeare, of Polk County, in April 2009. He won a $30million lottery jackpot in 2006. Hillsborough Sheriff David Gee alleges she tried to dodge suspicion by using Shakespeare's phone to send family members text messages saying he was OK and also writing letters pretending to be him, according to 10 News. Moore denies the murder and says she took over Shakespeare's assets, about $3.5million and a mansion, authorities say, so he could get away from people pestering him for money. 'The money was like a curse to him. And . now it's become a curse to me,' Moore told reporters in 2010. 'God knows . I would never take another human being's life.' But investigators claim Moore turned to a man called Greg Smith to cover up the crime. Charged: Moore pictured after her arrest in 2010 (left) and her alleged victim, Abraham Shakespeare, a 43-year-old truck driver (right) He was already signed up as a sheriff's informant and was working with detectives to get close to her and gather information.

Speaking at the time, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said when their investigation began they had hoped to find Shakespeare alive.

Britain's high-end housing market is in the grip of rich property dealers avoiding millions in tax and making huge profits which drives up prices, an investigation has revealed. At the heart of this powerful network of speculators is the British Virgin Islands - where the haven status allows the rich to build colossal property empires in the UK under cloaked in secrecy. In the last year more than £7billion of offshore funds has flooded into Britain, buying up some of London's most exclusive and expensive buildings and homes. This flurry of interest by dealers is forcing up the prices of all properties in London and other parts of the UK, experts say. Exclusive: Properties inside One Hyde Park, London's most expensive address, have been bought up by offshore investors who can avoid tax and are driving up prices . Expensive: Flats in One Hyde Park can go for more than £100million but offshore buyers need not pay stamp duty, inheritance tax and capital gains tax . The trend has been highlighted in a joint probe by the Guardian and the Washington based International Consortium of Investigative . Journalists. One group of investors has bought up huge chunks of One Hyde Park near Harrods, dubbed the world's most expensive address, with purchase prices ranging between £3million and £136million. Others have bought up the £97million Riverside House development on the Thames, the £30million 'Ark' building in Hammersmith as well as eight homes on Grosvenor Crescent in Belgravia worth £85million. Economic centre: The beautiful British Virgin Islands' tax haven status is allowing the rich to buy in secret and make huge sums of money . Properties like these in central London are already worth 49 per cent more than in 2009 - five times higher than the increase in the rest of Britain. As well as huge profits, investors using an offshore company also get substantial tax benefits: . Offshore property investments from the BVI are rocketing upwards, reaching £3.8billion in the last year, up from £2.7billion in 2010 and £1.5billion in 2009. There have been almost 100,000 of these transactions from abroad since 1999. The system also allows the person buying property to do it in secret by paying just £1,000 to a company who will keep their name, legally, off the land registry. Buy: The £30million 'Ark' in Hammersmith, London, is also owned from abroad . Luxury: Ofcom's headquarters, Riverside house, which stands on the Thames, is worth nearly £100million and is owned by an offshore company . This, in theory, would allow the rich to hide assets from the authorities, launder money from criminal enterprises and avoid tax in the country they own homes in. The Guardian has found that a Treasury report in 2001 warned of the abuses but the recommendations were rejected by the Blair government of the time. 'Parliament has decided that ownership of property should be in the public domain. The ability of owners to register land and property under names which conceal rather than reveal who they are flies in the face of the principle which parliament established.' Making sure people must be named would be 'invaluable for law enforcement, regulatory and tax authorities', he wrote and 'deter the unscrupulous from putting the proceeds of crime into property assets' and be 'helpful in tracing bankrupt persons and combating mortgage fraud'. 'If public policy emphasises privacy above transparency, the greatest beneficiaries are likely to be criminals,' he added. A consortium also bought some of these homes on Grosvenor Crescent in Belgravia - worth £85million . They are the epitome of London luxury but their purchase is part of a mad scramble for London property in recent years . Meanwhile the Government has already promised to investigate other suspicious practices revealed yesterday. Tens of thousands of bogus . companies are set up in Britain and fronted by sham directors dotted around . the globe is helping aggressive tax evaders and criminals keep millions.

Half of patients are 'too scared' to challenge medical advice given by doctors, even when they think it's wrong . Millions of patients are too scared to challenge medical advice given by hospital doctors and family GPs. New figures out today show nearly one in two are frightened to question a doctor’s opinion, more than patients in 12 other countries. A poll of more than 2,000 Britons suggest millions lack the confidence to tackle their GP or hospital consultant even when they believe the advice given is wrong. Now a leading patient’s charity has helped create a leaflet explaining how patients can challenge their doctor and demand more information. The Patients Association has teamed up with private healthcare provider Bupa, who commissioned the poll, to ensure patients are not railroaded into treatment and do not have their health concerns ignored. The poll comes less than a week after it emerged that a baby boy died of meningitis after doctors ignored his mothers’ pleas to take his condition more seriously. The parents of 13 month-old Bobby Bushell, from Doncaster, were paid a five-figure sum in damages by the hospital trust involved after a nurse told parents to wheel their son around the waiting room to stifle his screams as he was 'a bit loud'. Experts say patients are reluctant to question hospital doctors and GPs because of the authority they command, however, the number of web sites offering medical advice could be changing that. Dr Annabel Bentley, medical director for Bupa Health and Wellbeing said: 'The days of doctor knows best are over. We are in an era of patient knows best. 'Doctors may have had academic training but the point is only the patient knows how they feel and how a treatment effects them personally and will effect their lifestyle and any decisions need to be based on this.' The leaflet entitled ‘Constructive Conversations’ tells patients to challenge their doctor if told they need tests or treatments. This includes asking: ‘Why are you recommending this test for me?’ and ‘ How accurate is this test and what are the chances of it being wrong’ as well as ‘Are there any alternative treatments and what do they involve?’ The Bupa Health Pulse Survey questioned 15,000 people in 13 countries including Great Britain, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. They found those living in Egypt and Saudi Arabia were the most likely to question medical advice with three out of four saying they would challenge their doctor. The poll comes less than a week after it emerged that Bobby Bushell (pictured) died of meningitis after doctors ignored his mothers' pleas to take his condition more seriously . Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association said: 'Patients too often feel they are passive recipients of treatment and care. They want to be more involved; to ask questions or to discuss options but lack confidence and the tools to do so. This booklet goes some way in helping people get the most from the limited time they may have with healthcare professionals.' In recent years the explosion of health websites has led more and more people to self-diagnose or become expert on conditions they already have. But this has led to problems as many internet sites offer vague or sometimes dramatic answers for symptoms that are everday. This has led doctors to face a barrage of ‘worried-well’ patients demanding treatments that might not be relevant to their actual condition. The Bupa poll showed that 82 per cent of Britons look to the internet for medical advice but only half check that the website they are searching is a credible source of information.","Poll of more than 2,000 Britons suggests millions lack the confidence to tackle their GP or hospital consultant .

The remains of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were exhumed from his grave today so international forensic experts could search for additional clues to his death. Just hours after being removed, the corpse was reburied with full military honours. The exhumation began early today and the remains were taken from the massive mausoleum in the West Bank city of Ramallah where Arafat was buried and moved to a nearby mosque so Palestinian doctors could take samples from his bones. Scroll down for video . Investigation: As the body of the later Palestinian leader was exhumed blue covers were placed across the massive mausoleum in the West Bank city of Ramallah . Exhumed: Forensic experts will take samples to see if it can be determined if Arafat was poisoned . Work underway: Earlier this month, workers began prying open the concrete-encased tomb in Arafat's former government headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah . A nine-month investigation by Al Jazeera TV station found elevated levels of the polonium-210  in Arafat’s final personal effects. A murder inquiry was launched by French prosecutors in August. Reasons for exhumation: . Source: Al-Jazeera TV . Since his death in 2004 many . in the Arab world believe Arafat, the face of the Palestinian . independence struggle for four decades, was killed by Israel. Israel, . which saw Arafat as an obstacle to peace, vehemently denies the charges. Under Islam, only Muslims can handle a Muslim's remains. The samples will be handed over to French, Swiss and Russian experts who have flown in for the exhumation and who will examine them in their home countries, the officials said. Tawfik Tirawi, who heads the Palestinian team investigating the death said Arafat will be reburied the same day with military honors, but the ceremony will be closed to the public, Tirawi told a news conference. The whole process is set to take about 10 hours and before the exhumation, the head of the Palestinian committee investigating Arafat's death, Tawfik al-Tirawi, said no journalists would be allowed to observe the exhumation. He did not specify when results would be announced but said the probe could take months. Earlier this month, workers began prying open the concrete-encased tomb in Arafat's former government headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Cause of death: Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat saying goodbye as he boarded a Jordanian army helicopter to fly to Paris to seek medical treatment. Arafat died a month later in a French military hospital . Investigation: Yasser Arafat (right) in 2004 with his wife Suha who alleges he was poisoned . The Palestinian Authority, the . self-rule government in the West Bank, had hesitated before agreeing to . exhume the remains, in part because of cultural and religious . sensitivities. Since . mid-November, the gravesite has been surrounded with a blue tarpaulin . and roads leading to the Arafat mausoleum were closed. Arafat is still . widely revered in the Palestinian territories, and Palestinian officials . said they don't want the process observed by media and others. Earlier, samples were also taken from Arafat's bedroom, office and personal belongings, they said. The . new investigation into Arafat's death was sparked earlier this year by . the discovery of a lethal radioactive substance, polonium, on clothing . said to be his. Respect: Hundreds of Palestinian school children walk past the grave of Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat November 21, 2004 in Ramallah, West Bank . The clothes were provided by Arafat's widow, Suha, and given to the lab by the Arab satellite TV station Al-Jazeera. Arafat, who led the Palestine Liberation Organisation for 35 years and became the first president of the Palestinian Authority in 1996,  died in November 2004 in a French military hospital, a month after suddenly falling ill. While the immediate cause of death was a stroke, the underlying source of an illness he suffered in his final weeks has never been clear, leading to persistent speculation in the Arab world that Israel poisoned him. Israel has denied such allegations. Since his death there have been persistent conspiracy theories that he had cancer, AIDS or was poisoned. His widow, Suha, objected to a post-mortem at the time, but asked the Palestinian Authority to permit the exhumation 'to reveal the truth.' Questions: Tawfik Terawi, who heads the Palestinian team investigating Yasser Arafat's death, holds collection of the most important statements relating to the targeting of Arafat . Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the Palestinians were free to take all the samples they wanted. 'We have nothing to fear,' he said. 'All the accusations against Israel are completely ridiculous and not based on the slightest bit of evidence.' The exhumation might not resolve the mystery. Polonium-210 . decomposes rapidly, and some experts say it is not clear whether any . remaining samples will be sufficient for testing. The former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko died of exposure to polonium-210 in London in 2006. The UK authorities have accused Andrei Lugovoi, an ex-KGB officer, of poisoning his tea.","Arafat died in November 2004 in a French military hospital, a month after suddenly falling ill - immediate cause of death was a stroke .

A new flu vaccine that may work for life is in development in Germany. The experimental vaccine based on a molecule related to DNA currently protects animals against influenza and may one day offer a fast way to develop new shots for humans, German scientists said on Sunday. Assuming the vaccine also works in people, the new approach could allow commercial flu shots to be designed and manufactured in weeks rather than months. Vaccine experimentation: A new flu shot called Fluzone Intradermal hit the market last fall . Making vaccines quickly is critical in fighting influenza, particularly during a pandemic when health authorities and drugmakers are in a race to keep up with mutating strains of virus. Flu vaccines have traditionally been produced in chicken eggs, a tricky and lengthy process. More recently some firms have started using animal cell cultures, with Novartis on November 20 winning the first U.S. approval for such a product. Both approaches, however, still involve virus cultivation, which can result in variable yields and production delays. The new vaccine developed by Lothar Stitz of Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut and colleagues uses a quicker approach. It is made solely of messenger RNA (mRNA) -- a single-stranded molecule that carries information telling cells which proteins to make. Vaccine boss: Professor Lothar Stitz of Germany's Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut and his colleagues developed the new vaccine . DNA related: Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a large family of RNA molecules that convey genetic information from DNA to the ribosome . ‘The only thing we need is the sequence of the relevant genes,’ Stitz said. ‘It's a new option and it doesn't take long to do.’ His team vaccinated mice, ferrets and pigs with an mRNA vaccine and found that the immune response was similar or better than that found with conventional vaccines. What is more, the new vaccines showed high efficacy in very young and very old animals, which can be a problem with current flu shots. Reporting their results in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the scientists calculated that a completed vaccine could be produced within six to eight weeks of the genetic code of a flu virus strain being published. In contrast growing vaccines in fertilised chicken eggs can take up to six months, while using cell cultures may reduce that by up to eight to 10 weeks. Another potential advantage of mRNA vaccines is the fact that they do not need to be refrigerated. A human vaccine based on the research is still years away, since extensive clinical trials will be needed to test safety and efficacy, and the job of taking the work forward now rests with CureVac, a privately owned biotech company. CureVac, backed by billionaire German investor and business software firm SAP's co-founder Dietmar Hopp, is already developing a therapeutic mRNA vaccine for prostate cancer in human trials. The firm also has a vaccine for lung cancer in development and is working on prophylactic vaccines against several unnamed infectious diseases in a collaboration with Sanofi. Sanofi is a major supplier of flu vaccines, along with Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline.","A new flu vaccine that may work for life is in development in Germany .

Guilty: Former Iceland Prime Minister Geir Haarde was today convicted for failing to hold cabinet meetings as the economy collapsed . The former Prime Minister of Iceland has been found guilty of negligence over the country's 2008 financial collapse. Geir Haarde, 61, was convicted for failing to hold emergency cabinet meetings as the economy went into meltdown. But he was cleared of three other more serious charges and will avoid jail. Haarde was the first world leader to face prosecution in connection with the global banking crisis. More than £3billion was lost by British savers, councils and charities when the banks collapsed. The UK government is still trying to claw back money through the courts. Haarde led the Icelandic government between 2006 and 2009. He smiled and shook hands with supporters after the judgment was announced today. The 15 members of the Landsdomur, a . special court founded in 1905 to deal with criminal charges against . Icelandic government ministers, returned a 500-page verdict, but only a . brief summary was announced in public. His expenses for defending the case are to be met by the Icelandic state. Haarde, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, could have faced up to two years in prison. After the verdict, he said: 'In my opinion and let me say this clearly, I believe the majority of the judges have succumbed to political pressure in the case and decided to offer the prosecution a small consolation price to justify this low and costly process. 'The count of which I am found guilty has nothing to do with the origins of the financial crisis or the way I dealt with it.' He said he was considering appealing to the European Court of Human Rights on the conviction. 'I am found partially guilty for not discussing the financial situation in the markets frequently enough at cabinet meetings in the period leading up to the crisis in the period leading up to the crisis in 2008,' he said. Smiles: Despite being found guilty, Mr Haarde, pictured today with his wife Inga Jona Thordardottir, was found not guilty of three more serious charges and avoided jail . 'This is obviously a purely formalistic charge. It has nothing to do with the banking crisis as such. 'I can tell you that I have always found this charge to be even more ridiculous than the others.' Haarde originally faced six charges, but two were dismissed in October. Iceland's banking sector ballooned to nine times the nation's annual gross domestic product in a decade of boom, before collapsing under the weight of debt in October 2008. The country's three main banks collapsed in a single week. Haarde was convicted of failing to take the initiative to ensure 'a comprehensive and professional analysis of the financial risk faced by the state because of the risk of financial crisis.' He was cleared of malfeasance, of neglecting to act to reduce the size of the banking system, of not making sure that national bank Landsbanki's Icesave interest accounts in Britain were transferred to a subsidiary, and of failing to produce better results from the government's 2006 report on financial stability and preparedness. At the wheel as the economy collapsed: Geir Haarde, pictured here with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2008, was put on trial over the country's 2008 financial crisis accused of negligence . Testifying in March, Haarde said neither he nor financial regulators knew the real state of Icelandic banks' precarious finances until they collapsed. 'The bankers did not realize that the situation was as dire as it was,' Haarde said. 'It was not until after the crash that everyone saw it coming.' The special court included five supreme court justices, a district court president, a constitutional law professor and eight people chosen by parliament. Haarde, the former leader of the Independence Party, became a hated symbol of the bubble economy for Icelanders who lost their jobs and homes in the crash. He testified that the size of the bank would not have been a problem if not for their recklessness and a worldwide squeeze on credit, which also brought down major banks in the United States and Europe.","Geir Haarde could have faced two years behind bars .

Millions of television viewers saw her naked in Sherlock  - and millions more watched her on BBC's iPlayer. Such has been the pull of actress Lara Pulver in the episode A Scandal In Belgravia that it has become the most watched show on the catch-up service this year. Her character, Irene Adler, appeared nude (except for high heels) in the detective show, which was seen by 2.5million viewers online. This was 600,000 more than the next most watched show, which was the third instalment of Sherlock, The Reichenbach Fall. Lara Pulver as Irene Adler in Sherlock - the most watched show on BBC's iPlayer this year so far . The episode, A Scandal In Belgravia (starring Benedict Cumberbatch, left) has been seen online by 2.5million viewers . The arrival of the internet was supposed to herald the end of TV viewing but instead it is fuelling the nation’s addiction to TV shows. And the iPlayer is fuelling the boom in online viewing with an average of 190million programmes a month watched on the service between January and April this year. This is jump of 24 per cent on 2011 with Sherlock leading demand to watch shows again or to catch up on them later. Although more than eight million watched the programme on television, the average number of iPlayer requests across the series topped 2 million per show. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Sherlock is one of the BBC’s biggest hits but its success online may be down to its cryptic ending. It is thought thousands watched the series back to try to uncover clues as to how Holmes was able to fake his own death. Show creator Steven Moffat has added to the suspense by posting comments and hints such as a clue is in the fact that Holmes did 'something out of character'. He added: ‘So many people theorising - and they missed it.’ One fan wrote on his blog Barefoot on Baker Street: ‘Moffat has revealed that fans have ‘missed a vital clue’ - which has made us all turn to BBC iPlayer, Sky Plus etc and watch the whole thing again in the hope of being the one to solve the mystery, a mystery worthy of the great detective himself. The episode, entitled The Reichenbach Fall, was based on the 1893 Arthur Conan Doyle book The Final Problem, in which the author famously killed off the eccentric detective. Viewers watch Holmes view his own funeral from a distance after minutes earlier appearing to leap to his death from a tower block. Within minutes social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook were flooded with fans offering conspiracy theories and explanations. Many admitted they had watched the episodes repeatedly to try and work out how he could have survived. Moffat has said all would be made clear in the third series, which will broadcast later this year. On the rise: A BBC spokesperson said they had seen a 94 per cent rise in the number of people using iPlayer on mobile phones or tablets . Sherlock was by far the most popular programme to watch online in the year to date, with The Voice, The Apprentice and Top Gear all downloaded around 1-1.5 million times after they aired on the BBC. For radio programmes, Radio 4’s The Now Show, and Chris Moyles Breakfast Show were the most popular to listen again to. A spokesman for ITV said people watched 376 million programmes on its ITV Player service, an increase from 261 million in 2010. Most popular shows include Downton Abbey, The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent, but the broadcaster has yet to release figures for this year. More and more people are watching on tablets, iPads,mobile phones and modern televisions as technology improves. A BBC spokesman said it had seen a 94 per cent jump in the number of people using iPlayer on mobiles and tablets, and last month they accounted for 15 per cent of the online catch up viewing. It comes after research from media regulator Ofcom revealed traditional TV viewing is at a ten-year high with the average person now watching four hours a week. And the over-55 audience is watching the most - with more than five hours a day spent in front of the box. The watchdog credited the 'Downton Abbey' and 'The X Factor' effect for a boom in traditional viewing. But said that many people 'multi-tasked' while watching television , so would be simultaneously texting, or using social networking sites. The economic crisis has also had an impact on the amount of time spent at home. Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor have become 'appointment to view' programmes that are talked about as soon as they are broadcast - making it an increasingly social activity.","Actress Lara Pulver appears naked in A Scandal In Belgravia .

A Canadian mayor was ordered out of office Monday after a judge found he used city letterhead to fundraise for his high school football team. Mayor Rob Ford was ousted from his position as the leader of Toronto after it was discovered that he ‘flouted’ conflict of interest rules when he was a was a councilman. Ford blamed 'the left wing politics' for the ruling and said he would appeal. The development is the latest in a string of embarrassments for the colorful mayor who has repeatedly found himself in the news since he was elected in 2010. Ousted: Toronto Mayor was ordered out of office Monday after a judge found he used city letterhead to fundraise for his high school football team . Ontario Superior Court Justice Charles Hackland said Ford showed 'willful blindness' to the law and said he cannot claim that it was an error in judgment made in good faith. At issue was Ford's participation in a city council vote on repaying money he had solicited for his football program. Ford is a volunteer coach of a local high school team. The judge said Ford showed a 'stubborn sense of entitlement' and a 'dismissive and confrontational attitude' toward the city's integrity commissioner. The judge's ruling takes effect in two weeks, but Ford can seek an order that will allow him to stay in office while he appeals. The judge said Ford had his staff sent out letters using the city of Toronto logo and his status as city councilman to solicit funds for his football foundation. Donors included lobbyists and a corporation that does business with the city of Toronto. The city's integrity commissioner found Ford's actions broke a conduct code and recommended he pay back $3,150 to the donors from his own pocket. Conspiracy: Ford, who has had a number of public run-ins this year, blamed 'the left wing politics' for the ruling and said he would appeal . The council adopted the commissioner's findings and sanction in a resolution Ford voted against — but he never made the repayments, despite several reminders from the commissioner. Ford vowed to run again if he loses his appeal. 'I'm in no conflict here,' Ford said in a packed media scrum outside his office on Monday. 'This comes down to left wing politics. The left wing wants me out of here and they'll do anything in their power. I'm going to fight tooth and nail to hold onto my job. And if they do for some reason get me out I'll be running right back as soon as the next election.' Clayton Ruby, who represented a local Toronto resident in the conflict of interest lawsuit against Ford, said Ford did it to himself. 'If you break the rules there is a price to pay. It's important for the courts to assert that nobody is above the law, Rob Ford included,' Ruby said. Out of office: The city's integrity commissioner found Ford's actions broke a conduct code and recommended he pay back $3,150 to the donors from his own pocket . 'Rob Ford has said all along that he did this for the kids. He deserves credit for working with those kids, but he should have remembered that he had an obligation to those kids to set a good example for them. He should not have taken lobby money for his football team.' Ford, a right-wing city councilor for years, promised to end wasteful spending at city hall when he became mayor, tapping into a well of voter anger with his 'stop the gravy train' message. Ford also said Toronto would be better off if it didn't accept more immigrants. Half of Toronto's population was born outside Canada. He has often been in the news since. Controversies involving Ford include accusations he made obscene gestures at residents from his car, published pictures of him reading while driving on the highway and high profile altercations with a Toronto Transit worker as well as a Toronto Star reporter.","Not Mayor Rob Ford's first controversy .

They are a timeless and effective way to keep your home cosy and warm  during the winter. But badly-fitting wood burning stoves can be lethal, the Health Protection Agency is warning, silently and fatally leaking carbon monoxide into people’s living rooms. About 40 people die in a year across England and Wales from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning such as that caused by wood burning stoves. Badly-fitting wood burning stoves can be lethal, silently and fatally leaking carbon monoxide into homes (stock picture of a properly fitted stove) And 4,000 more need to be treated in accident and emergency for CO poisoning. Now the HPA has launched a winter campaign to raise awareness of the hazard. Dr John Harrison of the HPA said: 'Many of these deaths take place between November and February due to faulty fossil fuel and wood burning appliances, and are therefore preventable. 'To lower the risk, people should ensure that their fossil fuel and wood burning appliances are regularly checked by an appropriately registered engineer. The HPA has launched a winter campaign to raise awareness of the hazard and has advised people to fit Carbon Monoxide alarms . 'The HPA recommends that people have these appliances and their flues checked before the start of winter. 'Rooms in which appliances are used must also be adequately ventilated.' Carbon Monoxide is produced when fossil fuels burn without a good supply of air. It is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas which is difficult to detect. And If that happens in a room without adequate ventilation, levels can build up dangerously. A mild case of CO poisoning can just cause a very bad headache. But inhaling high levels can quickly starve major organs like the heart, brain and nervous system of oxygen, and if someone is exposed to high levels of CO for too long, they can fall unconscious and die within minutes. The HPA is recommending that people should fit an audible CO alarm which meets European Standards EN 50291, in their homes. Dr Harrison said telltale signs of carbon monoxide emissions included 'black sooty marks' on the wall around stoves, boilers or fires, or on the clay radiator bars of gas fires, and smoke accumulating in rooms due to faulty flues. Another sign was yellow flames on gas appliances that were meant to have blue flames. The HPA advises that if you see any of these signs, turn off the appliance, open your windows and have an appropriately registered engineer service the appliance as soon as possible.","Around 40 people die in a year across England and Wales from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning .

Luo Yuan who oversaw the development of China's first aircraft carrier plane, suffered a heart attack . An engineer who spent years developing the country's first fighter jet for a ship suffered a heart attack just moments after he witnessed the plane make its first successful landing. State broadcaster CCTV took the unusual step of running news of Luo Yuan's death as its first item on the noon broadcast, a rare honour for a scientist who was previously unknown outside of the aircraft carrier program. Luo, 51, oversaw the development of the J-15 fighter-bomber planes designated for the ship, which is called Liaoning after the province where it is based. Chinese academics assigned to signature . government projects such as this are often under enormous . pressure, and stress is considered among the biggest killers of the . country's intellectuals. Coverage of Luo's death illustrates the priority China has placed on the program, seen as representing the nation's rise from poverty to economic and political might over the past three decades. The carrier was built in the former Soviet Union and is seen as a test platform for future Chinese-built vessels. Few details were available about Luo, who died on Sunday. Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, where Luo worked, confirmed his death but declined to give details. The company produces the bulk of China's modern military jets - many of them, like the J-15, derived from Russian models. China overcame major technical hurdles to make the carrier seaworthy after buying the half-completed hulk from the Ukraine and towing it to China, minus its engines, weaponry and navigation systems. Most of that work was carried out in the northeastern port of Dalian, to which the carrier returned on Sunday following its latest round of sea trials. Landmark: The J-15 jet is seen landing on China's Liaoning aircraft carrier to mark the culmination of years of hard work . Despite the breakthrough in air operations, the ship is still years away from being battle-worthy. China's navy still needs to show it . can operate large numbers of planes at the same time and organise a . carrier battle group that includes submarines and support ships. 'The first landing may be a . milestone, but it's just the beginning,' said Toshi Yoshihara, professor . of Asia-Pacific studies at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island. 'How the Chinese will handle aircraft losses, which are inevitable, is a . better indicator of Beijing's determination to become a carrier.' The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy landed a J-15 fighter jet - capable of carrying missiles and . precision-guided bombs - on its Liaoning aircraft carrier while the ship . was out at sea. The . carrier, which is China's first, officially entered service two months . ago, but it is not expected to carry a full complement of planes or be . ready for combat for some time. Naval power: China's J15 fighter jet can carry missiles and precision-guided bombs . Take-off: The carrier-borne aircraft is seen taking to the skies over the ship in China . Liaoning: Since the carrier officially entered service in September, crew members have completed more than 100 tests and training exercises . China's state news agency released . pictures of the fighter touching down on the ship. The carrier is . regarded as symbolic of the country's bid to become a leading Asian . naval power. Xinhua said the landing exercise . marked the debut outing of the domestically developed J-15, which is . said to have capabilities to match those of Russia's Sukhoi Su-33 . carrier-based defence fighter, as well as the U.S. F-15 fighter jet. It is able to carry anti-ship, air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and precision-guided bombs. The carrier platform and J-15 capabilities met all requirements and achieved 'good compatibility', the news agency said. Since China's Liaoning ship formally entered into service on September 25, its crew members have completed over 100 training and test programs.

Inquiries revealed the Mr Boardman had been in the 'wrong place at the wrong time' and that Brookes had been been involved in a string of fights while out drinking with his girlfriend in St Annes, Lancs. Brookes was today starting a life sentence after admitting murder. He must serve a minimum of 18 and a half years before being considered for parole. The tragedy occurred on June 30 after Mr Boardman, described as a 'loving dad' had been asked to go to the flat to pick up property on behalf of a friend who lived there. When Mr Boardman arrived at the flat, he found his friend was not at home but Brookes, who also knew the friend, was present with his girlfriend and a 'tussle' broke out. Preston Crown Court was told neither Brookes nor his girlfriend knew who Mr Boardman was and the victim was set upon. Police were called to the flat and found Mr Boardman unconscious with fatal injuries to his face and body. DCI Pete Simm: 'On the night of Mr Boardman’s murder Jason Brookes had been out drinking with his girlfriend and had been involved in numerous confrontations with people in St Annes. Police and forensic officers outside a flat in St Annes, Lancashire where the attack on Mr Boardman took place . 'He was intent on becoming embroiled in a fight that night and sadly Andrew was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was subjected to a violent and sustained attack in which he was beaten to death without any provocation. 'Brookes attacked Mr Boardman with three separate weapons as well as kicking, stamping on and punching him while unconscious and incapable of defending himself. 'Mr Boardman sadly died as a result of the appalling injuries inflicted upon him. 'Brookes’ horrified girlfriend witnessed this murder and her bravery in producing evidence was crucial to the case.' Det Supt Paul Withers said: 'Brookes had been behaving in an aggressive manner through the course of the evening and was hell-bent on looking for trouble. 'He came across Mr Boardman and we know the end result. He was attacked . in quite a brutal manner. I think it’s terrible and it could have been . anybody. 'It was not some feud which had been going on for years, they had never come across each other before.' Sentencing Brookes to life in jail, Judge Stuart Baker said: 'No sentence I can impose can undo the needless loss of life or minimise the distress and grief which Mr Boardman’s family have experienced.' Mr Boardman is understood to have worked in the former Kembers bakery, on St Andrews Road South, St Annes, and lived in Lytham prior to splitting from his wife Eileen. The couple had two children together Zoe, 25, and Sarah, 22. In the immediate aftermath of the murder his heartbroken family released a statement which read: 'Andy spent the majority of his life in Lytham and worked as a baker in St Annes. 'He was recently divorced from Eileen and was a loving dad to Zoe, 25, and Sarah, 22. We are saddened by his sudden passing.'","Baker Andrew Boardman, 53, was visiting friend's flat when randomly confronted by Jason Brookes, 23 .

A toddler is watched closely by his parents using CCTV because a rare condition means he is at constant risk of dying from a seizure. Ollie Johnson, 17-months, has Dravet Syndrome and can suffer a seizure at any time sending his oxygen levels plummeting and putting him at risk of dying in his sleep. Parents Sarah, 32, and Stephen, 28, Johnson have hardly slept since Ollie was diagnosed afraid he would have an attack in the night. But now they say they are living a 'real-life Big Brother' after installing two CCTV cameras on his cot. The cameras are linked up to screens in their bedroom and living room so they can always keep a watchful eye on him. Demonstrating one of the CCTV monitors Ollie's parents use to keep a close check on him . Hooked up: Ollie Johnson wearing an oxygen saturation monitor (left) and one of the CCTV cameras (right) The couple have also bought Ollie a special mat which sounds an alarm if he stops breathing. Ollie also has an oxygen monitor attached to his toe, which sounds an alarm if the oxygen levels in his blood fall too low. Full-time mother Sarah, who also has her hands full with four-month-old twins Harley and Hayden, said the specialist equipment, which was part funded by the charity Dravet Syndrome UK, has given the family 'vital peace of mind.' Sarah, who gave up her job with charity Scope to become a full time mother, said: 'It is like big brother in the front room now. 'When we are watching TV I am constantly drawn to the screen. It is really comforting to know I can just turn round and see him. 'We never expected to have CCTV cameras inside our home, but they have now I cannot imagine life without all the equipment. 'We used to panic when Ollie had a seizure. I never wanted to go to sleep in case he had one in his sleep. Ollie has problems sleeping so the cameras allow us to check on him without walking in and disturbing him.' Ollie, who lives with his family in Hove, Sussex, was born healthy but suffered a 45 minute-long seizure when he was four-months-old. Stephen called an ambulance and Ollie was rushed to the Royal Alexandra Children’s Hospital, Sussex. Despite carrying out several tests doctors were unable to identify what was wrong with him. A month later Ollie had another seizure and in April this year he was eventually diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome by genetics specialists.

His parents didn't realise anything was wrong til he had a seizure at four-months old . As soon as they knew the risks involved in the condition Stephen and Sarah rushed out to start assembly his high tech bed. They bought two CCTV cameras, for about £100 each with one hanging over his cot and another hanging by his wardrobe were bought from eBay. Ollie also has a £1,000 oxygen saturation monitor, which works by monitoring his heart rate from a specialist company. If the oxygen levels drop it sounds an alarm. Ollie’s special mat, which cost around £300, detects a lack of movement and sets off an alarm if he stops breathing. The family have ordered a seizure mat which will set off an alarm if he thrashes around in his cot - they had to wait for Ollie to be 18 months so he was heavy enough for the technology to work. Ollie can have three forms of seizures - the most serious tonic clonic seizures, partial focal seizures, and the milder absent seizures which are like a daydream. Sarah hooks her son up to a monitor that triggers an alarm if his oxygen levels drop too low. When he is a bit bigger he will get a mat that will alert his parents if he has a seizure . In July Ollie had seizures four days in a row, then in November he had a seizure that lasted for more than an hour. Last Boxing Day the excitement of all his family being around him got too much for him and Ollie had 16 partial focal seizures in one day. Stephen and Sarah have learnt the triggers that can cause Ollie to have a seizure, which include temperature changes, illness, tiredness and excitement, and try to monitor them. Now Ollie, who takes Buccal Midazolam and Sodium Valproate at 7am and 7pm every day, has seizures about every fortnight, which last about 20 minutes. Sarah added: 'Ollie is advanced for his age. I spend lots of time reading with him and talking to him.' Dravet Syndrome is a neurological condition which affects about one in 40,000 children. It causes severe seizures and can lead to other conditions such as learning disability, ataxia and autism.

A dog owner has been jailed for stabbing his Staffordshire Bull Terrier to death, while his children slept upstairs. The family pet Cheech was left with at least 40 different wounds after Paul McCaw, 27, attacked her with a six-inch kitchen knife and then buried her in the back garden. McCaw claimed the animal had been suffering excruciating pain in its back legs caused by a car accident eight years ago and he wanted to put her out of her misery and could afford to take her to the vets. When the animal was missed by his children the following day, McCaw told them she had gone to 'doggy heaven'. When RSPCA inspectors turned up at his home after neighbours raised concerns, the father-of-three claimed he strangled the dog the previous day. But Cheech had actually suffered a 'terrible and violent death'. Peter Mitchell, prosecuting, told St Helens Magistrates' Court: 'He said that the dog collapsed in pain, so he took it into the back garden and he strangled it, taking about 20 minutes.' McCaw, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, allowed inspectors to dig up the body but lied and told them it was buried in a field next to a cemetery. When the RSPCA inspectors demanded to look in his back garden, he 'refused them access and became hostile'. They left and later returned with a police officer where they were able to dig for Cheech under a patch of recently disturbed soil. The ten-year-old dog was covered in multiple stab wounds and soaked in blood. Mr Mitchell said that one of the wounds looked as if McCaw had attempted to 'slash its wrist'. She also had wounds to its head, chest and neck. Blood was also found on table legs inside the house, on a children's toy box and dried blood on the remaining edge of a piece of lino that had been cut away. 'This dog suffered an absolutely terrible, . violent death at the hands of an owner who had been responsible for her . for almost her entire life' In total Cheech suffered 40 wounds - with one puncturing a lung - causing her to collapse. Mr Mitchell said the dog died drowning in its own blood. Under police interview, McCaw said Cheech had been struggling with her legs for the past ten months. Mr Mitchell described how McCaw lay beside his dog and tried to slit her throat, before plunging the kitchen knife into her chest. His defending solicitor Mark Brown said McCaw had previously sought veterinary help for Cheech. On the night she was killed, Cheech jumped off the settee and appeared to be in pain. McCaw had given her half a paracetamol tablet in the past, but on this night, the dog snapped and bit him, said Mr Brown. Tragic: RSPCA inspectors found Cheech, pictured, covered in blood and stab wounds buried in the back garden . He added: 'In his own mind (McGraw), was of the view that Cheech was suffering and needed to be put out of its misery. No vet is going to turn away a dog that needs to be treated, which is what he should have done.' The court was told McCaw tried to smother Cheech, but when that did not work he stabbed her. Mr Brown said: 'The next morning, the children came down, but couldn’t find the dog. He told them it had died and had gone to doggy heaven. 'He didn’t even tell his partner and that appeared to be that. Then two days later the inspectors came knocking.' He was jailed for 18 weeks on Monday, having pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the dog at a previous hearing. He was also banned from keeping animals for 20 years. RSPCA inspector Louise Showering said: 'This dog suffered an absolutely terrible, violent death at the hands of an owner who had been responsible for her for almost her entire life. 'Though he says he thought he was putting her out of her misery, he actually caused her to suffer much more with the actions he took. First trying to suffocate her then stabbing her many, many times. 'I can’t imagine what this dog’s final hours must have been like at the hands of someone she loved. 'It certainly wasn’t the dignified and pain-free end most owners hope for their beloved pets.'","Paul McCaw, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, stabbed Staffordshire Bull Terrier Cheech 40 times .

"PUBLISHED: . 14:26 EST, 22 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:41 EST, 23 July 2012 . An Afghan man shot his two teenage daughters dead when they returned home four days after running away with a young man, police said today. The father has been detained on murder charges in Nad Ali district in the southern province of Helmand, a hotbed of Taliban insurgency, provincial police spokesman Farid Ahmad Farhang said. 'He killed two of his daughters. His daughters had run away with a young man four days ago. When they returned home their father killed them,' Mr Farhang said. This week's killings come after a video emerged earlier this month (still shown above) in which the Taliban are seen executing a woman accused of adultery . Police have issued an arrest warrant for the young man, who is said to be working as an interpreter with Nato forces in the southern province, the spokesman added. Relations between men and women outside marriage are strictly controlled under Islam and infringements are harshly punished by most families in ultra-conservative Afghanistan. Despite progress since the fall of the Taliban, so-called 'honour killing' remains a common practice in the war-torn Islamic nation. News of the girls' deaths emerged as officials said an Afghan couple who eloped to neighbouring Pakistan were being held in protective custody amid fears the bride's angry relatives will kill them. Hewad, who is 22 and known by only one name, wed 18-year-old Mariyam Marjman in the town of Abbottabad, around 30 miles north of Islamabad, last month after escaping Kabul with the help of a Pakistani friend. Marjman told officials a 'jirga', or assembly of her relatives, had travelled to Abbottabad to take her back to Afghanistan, where she would probably be murdered for marrying a person of her own choice. 'Mariyam declared that Hewad is her husband and both of them were in love before they got married,' senior local administration official Imtiaz Shah said, adding that the bride’s parents wanted her to marry her dead sister’s husband. He said that the couple had brought the two-year-old daughter of Marjman’s dead sister with them to Pakistan. David Cameron arriving in Helmand this week, where he announced he would be bringing home more troops - but there are fears Afghan women's rights will suffer a setback when Nato forces leave . The teenage bride has been moved to an orphanage with her niece, while her husband is at a prison in the northwest city of Mansehra. The couple will appear at the high court in Peshawar on Monday, where officials will decide whether to hand them over to the bride's relatives. Progress has been made on women’s rights since the Taliban were ousted, but many fear those gains are under threat as Nato troops leave and Kabul seeks peace with Islamist insurgents. Earlier this month a video emerged appearing to show the Taliban's public execution of a woman accused of adultery in a village near Kabul. The shocking footage, in which scores of men cheer as the executioner guns down the woman at close range, led to international condemnation after it surfaced in Afghan media. The 22-year-old, named as Najiba, is shown crouching with her back to the gunman, who is thought to be her militant husband. She collapses after a few shots, but the man continues to fire. She had been accused of having an affair with a Taliban commander. Police believe the video was recorded on a mobile phone, in Parwan province, where security has deteriorated in the past two years. Taliban insurgents executed five civilians near Kabul for working with Nato troops, authorities said today. The killings mark the latest in a series of militant activities in villages around the capital. News of the incident, in Wardak province’s Jalrez district, 25 miles south of Kabul, came a day after the insurgents publicly lashed two Afghan men and just weeks after the public execution of a woman for adultery. In Jalrez, the rebels captured six Afghans returning home from work at a Nato base. The bodies of five of them were found on Sunday, all booby-trapped with explosives, a statement from the provincial governor’s office said. Their hands were tied behind their backs, a witness said. The sixth man fled his captors, the statement added, blaming the killings on the Taliban. The rebels are particularly active across the southern and eastern provinces, and appear to have stepped up efforts to impose their harsh version of Islamic Sharia law, which they implemented when they were in power between 1996 and 2001. On Saturday, Taliban insurgents whipped two men 40 times in public in a village south of Kabul after accusing them of attempting to kidnap a young boy for ransom. Public punishments and executions were common until the Taliban regime was ousted by a US-led invasion in 2001. Earlier this month, a video showing the public execution of a 22-year-old woman who was shot in the back in Parwan province just north of Kabul in front of a crowd of cheering men, drew worldwide condemnation.",Killings come as Afghan couple who eloped to Pakistan enter police custody amid fears they will be murdered .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:38 EST, 14 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:56 EST, 15 May 2012 . Sadness: Trevor Phillips, Chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said he regretted failing to challenge race rules . Thousands of children have lost the chance of a decent life because of the ban on mixed-race adoption, the state equality chief has admitted. Trevor Phillips said it was his greatest regret that he failed to challenge the race rules which denied children the chance of a loving family and instead left them at the mercy of a failing care system. Changes could have been made 10 years ago if the race relations watchdog had called for an inquiry, Mr Phillips said. The acknowledgement by Mr Phillips of the damage done by the ban follows the Coalition’s decision to legislate to sweep away race rules. The new law will reinforce guidelines already handed to social workers that tell them the need to find a family for a child is more important than their longstanding doctrine which says, for example, it is bad for a black child to be brought up by a white family. For more than two decades adoptive parents have been strictly screened on race grounds, with many rejected because they have been judged the wrong match. Social workers have been trained to believe that black children lose self-esteem and pride in themselves if they are not brought up by parents of the same colour. Critics have said there is no evidence to support this theory and that race has been used as an excuse to depress the number of adoptions. Mr Phillips, who is to step down as chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission this summer, said he should have challenged the race ban when he was appointed chief of its race relations predecessor, the Commission for Racial Equality, in 2003. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘If I had to pinpoint one single thing I would say that I wish when I took over at the CRE I had been more aggressive on the issue of transracial adoption. ‘If I had ordered an inquiry, an investigation, it would have shown pretty clearly that the life chances of children would have been much much better in a family of any race compared to staying in care. 'I would have then be able to essentially change the policy in local authorities 10 years ago.’ Mr Phillips added: ‘My personal regret is that hundreds of children, maybe thousands of children, would now be in families who got stuck in the care system. If I had to go back and do something different, I would do something about that. ‘Being in care is the surest indicator that you will end up in crime, in drugs, that you will end up unemployed, and your children will repeat your experience.’ He added: ‘I think if we had been more aggressive on this issue we could have transformed the lives of very many children. But these are things we know in hindsight.’ It was the first time Mr Phillips is thought publicly to have criticised the ban on mixed-race adoptions, although critics of the system have long held that adoption was the last area of public life in Britain in which authorities were prepared to support open racial discrimination. History: In 2000 Tony Blair suggested that the bar to transracial adoption should go . In 2000 Tony Blair suggested that the bar to transracial adoption should go, and his Government began to publish figures illustrating how long black children had to wait for new families because of the race rules. But his 2002 Adoption Act had nothing to say about race. Mr Phillips was the leading Labour figure on the London Assembly at the time. He went on to head the CRE and then the EHRC when it took over from all the state equality bodies in 2007. Social workers have long been criticised for failing to back adoption for children in care, preferring to see them brought up in the care system which often means life in a children’s home or shifted repeatedly between different foster parents. Middle class couples hoping to adopt have long been rejected on a series of flimsy grounds, including their age, their smoking habits, or their beliefs. There are currently around 65,000 children in the care system, with numbers rising because more children are being taken into state care following the Baby P scandal in 2008. Last year just 3,050 children were adopted from state care, among them only 60 babies under a year old, the lowest total since 2001.","Trevor Phillips said it was his greatest .

A top-of-the-range Ferrari which was famously crashed by Cristiano Ronaldo in a Manchester tunnel three years ago is being sold for just £40,000 - because it is still a wreck. The Portugal and Real Madrid striker, who was then playing for Manchester United, smashed the 205mph Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano into a tunnel wall outside Manchester in 2009. And no efforts have been made to repair the smashed-up sports car since the embarrassing incident. Wreck: The Ferrari 599 crashed by footballer Cristiano Ronaldo in a Manchester tunnel three years ago is being offered for sale in France for £40,000 . Lucky escape: Ronaldo, then a Manchester United player, was fortunate to escape injury when his 205mph sports car crashed into a safety barrier and bounced off a wall . Superstar: The Portuguese, seen here on his return to Manchester with Real Madrid this week, had bought the Ferrari new for £200,000 . It was shipped out of the UK and has now come onto the market in France through an agent in Alsace. Agent Autos, based in the small town of Duppigheim, are asking £40,000 for the wreck - a fraction of its £115,000 value. A four-year old model in decent condition is worth nearly three times as much as the asking price, though the seller describes it as 'repairable'. If fixed, the Italian sports car will offer blistering performance thanks to a six-litre V12 engine capable of 612bhp. It is capable of a top speed of 205mph and does 0-60mph in just 3.7 seconds. Needs work: The sports car, on offer in Alsace, France for a third of its book price, needs extensive repairs - including a new front wing and front left wheel . Three-wheeler!

Ronaldo bought the car new, spending £200,000 on it. But any prospective buyers will need to replace the windscreen, wing mirrors and front body panels - or they could sell the remaining parts. Ronaldo lost control of the rear-wheel drive car in January 2009 on his way to training at United's Carrington base and crashed into a roadside barrier before bouncing off a wall. The accident happened on a stretch of the A538 that takes traffic under the runways of Manchester Airport between Wilmslow, Cheshire, and Hale. What a mess: Police officers inspect the damage following the crash in January 2009. Ronaldo was on his way to training with Man United at Carrington . No charges: Ronaldo was breathalysed by police but was not charged with any dangerous driving offences . Superstar: Ronaldo in action for Portugal at the 2012 European Championship finals . Luckily for manager Sir Alex Ferguson, he emerged without a scratch and after being breathalysed by police, completed his journey with teammate Edwin Van Der Sar, who was travelling behind in his Bentley Continental. An eye-witness said at the time: The front of Ronaldo's car was completely mangled. 'There was metal all over the road, and debris. We had to dodge our way through it. 'Ronaldo was just standing at the side of the road looking forlorn and bewildered.' Officers from Greater Manchester Police investigated the incident but no charges were pressed. The Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano was released in 2006 amid great fanfare and intended to be the successor to the Maranello line of powerful front-engined two-seaters. It was named after the Fiorano circuit where Ferrari test their new models. It completed the overhaul of the Ferrari range to all-aluminium shells but retained the same V12 six-litre engine as its predecessors. The 'F1-Superfast' flappy paddle transmission, which changed gears in just 100ms, was lauded as a huge improvement. With the engine and chassis weight reduced, the 599 was capable of 205mph and 0-100 in about seven seconds. The price straight out of the factory was £193,234.","The Ferrari 599 was crashed by the football star into a Manchester tunnel wall in 2009 .

These pictures show three stolen luxury cars stripped and broken down to their components as part of a £600,000 racket to sell spare parts across Europe via eBay. The Mercedes, Audi and Land Rover were among 41 prestige vehicles snatched during house burglaries in the Manchester area and then driven back to warehouses to be taken apart by a gang of 'Del boy' traders. They raised hundreds of thousands of pounds selling the parts on eBay and other internet auction sites to unsuspecting buyers. Stripped: A broken down Audi RS4, one of the luxury cars taken down to their component parts by a gang based in Manchester, Blackburn and Leicester . Spare parts: The component parts of this stolen Land Rover were sold on eBay and other online auction sites to buyers across Europe . But the gang were caught when a prospective buyer responded to an advert for 'genuine Audi RS4 Recaro interior bucket seats' for sale on eBay. He visited a salvage centre in Wythenshawe, Manchester to buy them, but became 'suspicious' and tipped off police who discovered further bases in Blackburn and Leicester. Police released photographs of the broken up motors as Shoayb Patel, 26, of Blackburn, was sentenced to three years and four months in prison. Arif Gorji, 31, also of Blackburn, was jailed for two years and eight months. Both admitted concealing criminal property. Convicted: Shoayb Patel (left) was sentenced to three years and four months, while his business partner Arif Gorji (right) received two years and eight months for his part in the £600,000 eBay car part racket . The men sold component parts of stolen luxury cars, including Audi TTs, BMW 550s and BMW M5s, over a two-and-a-half year period through their firm JG Salvage in Wythenshawe, Manchester Crown Court heard. Gorji, who had previously been jailed for selling counterfeit clothing on eBay in 2008, set up an account called UKSALVAGE2012 on the auction site, which was used to sell more than £18,000 worth of stolen car parts. Neil Fryman, prosecuting, told the jury: 'This case is about car ringing - stealing cars, breaking them up and then selling on the parts. 'Various people within this enterprise played different roles. The vehicles were pretty high value and pretty much prestige-type vehicles.' Following the tip-off from the prospective buyer, police uncovered the car ringing racket in October 2010 when they stopped a Ford Transit van driven by two accomplices of Gorji and Patel after they dropped off car parts at the Wythenshawe site. Broken down: This Mercedes E500 was discovered in the Wythenshawe lock-up, with its wheels, engine, gearbox and even body panels stripped off . Later that day, officers raided the yard and discovered the unit was being used to store car component parts. They seized a large number of high value items, including engines, gearboxes and body panels. Police found a list of 19 cars - 17 of which matched records of stolen vehicles. A further raid on a breakers yard 120 miles away in Leicester uncovered chassis and parts from 14 stolen cars and two sets of number plates from vehicles stolen in London. It emerged that identifying numbers had been ground down from the stolen parts. A third raid, in March last year in Blackburn, found Gorji and Patel loading a large heavy goods vehicle bound for Germany with engines and gearboxes. The 20 engines from stolen vehicles on the truck were worth an estimated £127,000. Portuguese cousins Jose Joaquim, 36, and Helder Santos, 33, who ran the Leicester breakers yard, were convicted of money laundering offences and were each jailed for two years. A fifth man, Ayas Patel, 34 from Bolton, was given a year's suspended sentence and ordered to complete 240 hours of unpaid work. Police are hunting a sixth member of the gang, Imran Chokwala, 30, who is believed to be on the run in India.

Det Con Ashley Matthias from Greater Manchester Police’s Organised Crime Unit, said today: 'This was a highly organised criminal enterprise headed by Arif Gorji and Shoayb Patel. 'It involved the theft and disposal of more than £600,000 worth of cars and the resale of their parts to innocent purchasers through eBay and other sale websites. 'They had no regard for those innocent members of the public who were buying stolen parts from them or for the victims of the burglaries from where the majority of the stolen vehicles originated. 'It is a priority for police to combat organised crime, reduce burglary and tackle all theft related offences. 'We hope that operations such as this demonstrate our commitment to these priorities, and show that we will continue to try and make people feel safer in their homes. 'We will not rest until we have brought criminals to justice, no matter how sophisticated or successful they think they are.'","Mercedes, Audi and Land Rover cars among those stolen and stripped down for £600,000 spare parts racket .

Thanksgiving shopping took some of the wind out of Black Friday this year, as a recent survey shows in-store retail sales on the ‘busiest shopping day’ dropped from last year. Holiday shoppers spent $11.2 billion at stores across the U.S. this Friday, down 1.8 per cent from last year, according to a Saturday report from the Chicago-based retail technology company ShopperTrak. Those lower in-store sales figures were apparently impacted by hundreds of thousands of shoppers hitting stores on Thursday evening after filling up on turkey and stuffing. Tough sell: 'I had four items on my list and got one. This is ridiculous,' said Joe Allen, of Carolina Forest, center, shortly after the 6am opening at a JC Penney in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on Black Friday morning . Holiday shoppers: Bianca Castillo, left,and her cousin Gabriella Alejo, right, smile after getting 32"" TVs at a Target in Austin, Texas, shortly after it opened at 9 p.m. on Thursday, November 22, 2012 . ‘Black Friday shopping continues to expand into Thanksgiving Day and will impact the way we look at all of the ‘Black’ weekend results, since more shopping hours allows for more shopping visits and a smoothing of sales across all of the days,’ said ShopperTrak founder Bill Martin. Big chain outlets including Sears, Target, Toys ‘R’ Us and Walmart opened their doors as early as 8pm on Thanksgiving. A sharp rise in online shopping likely added to the drop in spending at brick-and-mortar stores this year. E-commerce sales rose 17.4 per cent on Thanksgiving and 20.7 per cent on Black Friday, compared with last year, according to a recent IBM survey. Earlier shoppers: Things got a little wild in the shoe department at the Columbiana Centre Belk in Columbia, South Carolina, Thanksgiving night as throngs of shoppers got a jump on Black Friday sales . Still, ShopperTrak said Black Friday foot traffic increased 3.5 per cent this year to more than 307.67 million store visits -- a sign that more people were browsing store shelves, if not making actual purchases. ‘Black Friday continues to be an important day in retail,’ Martin said. ‘This year, though, more retailers than last year began their doorbuster deals on Thursday, Thanksgiving itself. So while foot traffic did increase on Friday, those Thursday deals attracted some of the spending that's usually meant for Friday.’ Still plenty of action: Shoppers in the Macy's Herald Square flagship store in New York looking for bargains this Black Friday . ShopperTrak estimated that foot traffic increased the most in the Midwest, up 12.9 per cent compared with last year. Foot traffic in the Northeast increased the least compared with last year, up 7.6 per cent in regions that include those hit hardest by Hurricane Sandy. ShopperTrak, which counts sales numbers from 25,000 retail outlets across the U.S., had forecast that Black Friday sales would grow 3.8 per cent this year. A separate survey from the National Retail Federation says holiday spending on both days combined will likely rise 4% this year. Some positive signs of spending growth have been in the news in the past few months. U.S. consumer confidence rose to 72.2 in October, its highest level since February 2008 and up from 40.9 a year ago. Yet many consumers are still worried about the slow economic recovery, high unemployment rates and a looming fiscal cliff.

Ministers have pledged to close a ‘nonsense’ anomaly that has seen more than 5,000 children – some as you as 11 – banned from driving even though they are not yet old enough to legally drive. Alerted to the scandal exposed by their own figures,  Ministers promised to act to crack down on what they admit is a serious threat to road safety. In total some 5,333 under-age driving offenders have been ‘banned’ from driving since 2009 - including five 11-year-olds - analysis of Government figures obtained from a Freedom of Information request to the DVLA by motoring magazine Auto Express. New figures: More than 5,000 under-age offenders have been banned from driving since 2009 (posed by model) Presented with the alarming data by Mailonline, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘This strikes me as a nonsense and I will be talking to my colleagues at the Department for Transport about this.’ Roads Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘I agree that this sounds like nonsense and an anomaly. I will be looking at this urgently. ‘We are fully committed to keeping Britain’s roads among the safest in the world and this means taking a tough line on anyone who breaks the law regardless of age. ‘Young drivers already face sanctions – . under current legislation disqualifications are endorsable offences, . which means points can be carried onto provisional licences and used by . courts under the totting up system for future bans. Anomaly: more than 5,000 children have been banned from driving for motor offences before the age of 18 (picture posed by model) ‘I will take a careful look at . circumstances where very young drivers whose points or disqualifications . have become spent before they are eligible to drive to make sure they . are effectively dealt with.’ Nonsense': Justice secretary Chris Grayling said he would be talking to the Department of Transport about the 'anomaly' The AA said the law must be changed . so that  most serious and prolific offenders should face an extended . driving test and be subject to social reports before they can take their . first test. And offenders banned for a period that goes over their 17th . birthday should not be eligible to take the test. AA spokesman Paul Watters said: ‘It is good that the government has been stirred to look at this. ‘I think the average motorist will be horrified by these figures. Motoring lawlessness is a real problem in this country, Thankfully only a . small minority of young people behave in this way.’ For the future he stressed: ’Prolific . and repeat child offenders should have these offences  etched into . their driving record and have them taken into account should they ever . commit an offence after the age of 17. ‘The most serious offenders should . face an extended driving test and be subject to social reports before . they can take a proper test at 17.  And offenders banned for a period . that goes over their 17th birthday should not be eligible to have a . licence  unless they too take  an extended test with social reports.’ Mr Watters added: ‘It might be better . for the original under-age  bans to be suspended and subject to being . re-invoked – but not automatically – if the they re-offend after the age . of 17.’ The Ministry of Justice confirmed that currently young people convicted of  driving offences will be  subject to penalty points and disqualification even if they are not yet old enough to hold a driving licence, and that the bans come into force from the time they are imposed by a court, rather than from the age when the offender reaches driving age.","Ministers say it is a 'nonsense' anomaly that needs to be changed .

A new era for mobile phone use begins today as superfast 4G products and services are made available to millions of consumers in 11 cities across the UK. Claiming to offer speeds five times faster than current networks, it is billed as a 'landmark day' for Britain. However, experts have hit out at the pricing, and warned consumers to wait. Britain's first 4G network, run by EE, launches today -but has come under fire for its high prices . Costly: EE has come under fire for its high pricing, with experts advising consumers to wait for rival networks to launch . EE, formerly known as Everything . Everywhere, launch its range of 4G products and services today in  London, . Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Glasgow, . Liverpool, Southampton and Manchester. The launch comes amid criticism of EE’s 4G pricing plans, which will hit customers on certain tariffs with additional charges if they exceed download allowances. Consumers will have to switch their mobile contract to EE to use the new network. The cheapest EE tariff offers just . 500mb worth of downloads each month - the equivalent to two one-hour . programmes on the BBC iPlayer. Customers . who want to download more than their 500mb allowance will have to pay . extra, with a user looking to download eight one-hour programmes a month . facing additional charges of up to £180 a year. The . EE deals range from £36 a month for 500mb of data downloads to £56 a . month for 8GB of data. The 4G network, which offers speeds up . to five times faster than 3G, will be available on the Apple iPhone 5 as . well as devices from HTC, Samsung, Nokia and Huawei. There are no plans for unlimited data downloads, leading experts to warn consumers to wait. 'Very few consumers should buy a 4G contract from day one,' said Jason Jenkins of CNET. 'The service only works in eleven cities today (although many more will follow quickly), and it's very expensive to use. 'Come back in a year or two though, . and many more of us will be on 4G, so if you're buying a top-end phone, . make sure it will work with all the 4G networks that will launch in the . UK. 'For example, Apple's iPhone 5 will . only work with one or two UK 4G networks in the future, whereas the . Samsung Galaxy S3 LTE or Nokia Lumia 920 will work with all of them. However, Jenkins admits the service is a big step forward. 'If you don't do your research, you . could get caught out once your contract comes to an end and you want to . use the phone you paid so much for on a different network.' 'Today is massive for UK tech - . Britain's first 4G phone network launches. 'This is an incredibly . important milestone in our race to compete with the rest of the world as . several other countries already have 4G. EE customers in a further five cities - Belfast, Derby, Hull, Newcastle and Nottingham - will have access to 4G by the end of the year. The group then plans to roll out the service to further towns, cities and rural areas next year, with population coverage of 70% and rising to 98% in 2014. Rival operators including Vodafone, O2 owner Telefonica and Three will be able to launch their own 4G services and products from next spring. The companies had threatened legal action against communications regulator Ofcom over its 4G auction process, which has allowed EE to be the sole UK provider of the superfast services until next year. Vodafone launched a '4G phone promise' last week, offering customers the chance to bring an eligible phone into any store and have 70% knocked off their remaining contract, in exchange for taking on a 4G device. Olaf Swantee, CEO at EE, said: 'Today is . a landmark day for our company, the UK mobile industry and, most . importantly, the country’s businesses and consumers. 'But . this is just the start as our 4G network will continue to grow stronger . and wider by the day. 'We’re investing £1.5 billion in our network to be . the first company to offer mobile 4G in the UK, alongside the biggest . 3G network.' Olaf Swantee, CEO of EE says today is a 'landmark day' for the firm as it launches Britain's first 4G network . Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: . 'The 4G rollout is a game changer for the mobile market. But the launch of the service on a single network, EE, has already stirred up problems for mobile users when it comes to choosing whether or not to make the leap to super-fast mobile internet or stay put with their current providers. 'As expected, rival networks have waged war on EE in a heated bid to hang onto existing customers, promising discounted mid-contract upgrades to 4G phones in the future, as an alternative to switching to EE right now. 'The first spanner in the works for mobile fans was Vodafone's ad campaign’s claim: ""not all 4G networks are the same,""' citing that their eventual roll-out will provide better indoor coverage than that of EE. The second is the realisation that handsets touted as '4G-ready' could well cause confusion, with different networks using different spectrums to provide the service. 'Our research shows that as many as 45% of Brits think they don't need 4G and 29% don't even know what it is. If the mobile giants want to win customers, they need to make things as jargon-free and transparent to the average consumer as possible – or risk causing even more confusion.'","EE network goes live today in 11 cities .

A young cancer patient who raised £35,000 in just three weeks to fund life-saving surgery has died - just two weeks before the operation. Laura Baxter, 27, had been fighting a rare cancer of the appendix for two years. Chemotherapy and an operation to remove the cancer had already failed. British doctors said they could do nothing more to help, but medics in Belgium had agreed to try the procedure again at a cost of £25,000. Just three weeks ago, MailOnline told of Laura's plight to raise the money to have the operation, attracting comments from scores of readers. Laura Baxter, 27, had been fighting a rare cancer of the appendix for two years. UK surgeons had told he it was inoperable . Cancer of the appendix affects just one in two million people. Laura had surgery to remove the deadly cancerous tissue in June, but was told it in August it had started to regrow. When MailOnline reported the story, she had been told she had six to eight months to live. But news came this week that she had tragically passed away. As soon as Laura had been given hope by the Belgian doctors, her family and friends began fundraising. They reached their £25,000 target within ten days, going on to raise £35,000 in just a few weeks. Speaking after reaching her fundraising total, Laura, from St Ives, Cambridgeshire, had said: 'I think it’s amazing that there are so many nice, good-hearted people that genuinely care for another person’s life and in such a selfless way. 'I should be saying loads more but am at a loss for words. I just want to say thank you to everyone.' But Laura was cruelly denied her final chance of life when she was taken in to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, on October 28 with an infection. Laura, with boyfriend Wayne, had been offered a lifeline by Belgian medics, who had agreed to try the procedure again at a cost of £25,000 . Last Wednesday, her condition began to rapidly deteriorate and she died in hospital at 10pm on Friday. Her mother Jacky Baxter and partner Wayne Cooper - who was planning to marry Laura and adopt children with her - were by her side. Mrs Baxter said her daughter had been 'so excited' that the money for the operation had been raised so quickly. 'Laura said she was ready to go home and it was planned that she would come out this Monday, but she started to deteriorate on Wednesday. It happened so quickly, we were in shock. 'Then on Friday she shut her little . eyes and just drifted off. She didn’t have to suffer in any way. The . nurses and doctors were there for her every step of the way.' The money raised . will now be split between the PMP Survivors Charity, to . fund research into the rare cancer, and the C9/D9 wards at Addenbrooke’s . Hospital. Laura’s family hope the funds will be . used to pay for new medical equipment to replace the old machines the . nurses currently use. Well-wishers donated £35,000 after Laura's story was revealed three weeks ago, when she believed she had six months to live. She died last Friday . Laura was diagnosed with . pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) two years ago and underwent an operation to . remove a cyst that contained a cyst containing cancerous tissue. Doctors thought the cancer had been contained, but the disease came back and spread. In June of this year, Laura had her . sixth operation, a 12-hour procedure to her affected organs, including . parts of her small intestine, at a specialist hospital in Basingstoke. Surgeons left three per cent of the . cancer on her liver and planned to treat it with a heated chemotherapy . bath - where drugs are warmed to 40 degrees and left in the abdomen for . hours. But in August, doctors at . Addenbrooke’s Hospital discovered the cancer had returned and Laura was . given six-to eight months to live. Both UK-based PMP specialist . hospitals, The Christie, in Manchester, and The Basingstoke and North . Hampshire Hospital, said the cancer was too advanced for their surgeons . and a specialist was required. Brave Laura refused to give in and found doctors around the world that would be able to help her. She contacted Dr Wim Ceelen, of Ghent . University Hospital, in Belgium, a veteran of 450 of the life-saving . operations, who was willing to carry out the surgery for £25,000. Eurostar generously offered free travel to Ghent for Laura and Wayne. Laura was just waiting to recover . from an infection, which she was being treated for in Addenbrooke’s . Hospital since October 28, before she could book a surgery date with Dr . Ceelen. Her family said the NHS would not pay for the operation because Addenbrooke’s Hospital believed the cancer was terminal. Dr Wim Ceelen at Gent University Hospital, Belgium, believed he could help Laura . But they said if Laura had survived the operation they would reimburse her part of the money. However, sadly her condition began to deteriorate last Wednesday and she died at Addenbrooke’s Hospital on Friday. Her mother added: 'Throughout the last two years, she kept on saying she wouldn’t die, she was so stubborn about it. She had everybody behind her and she drew strength from that. It kept her battling for longer. 'She did her . research and found doctors in America who wanted to charge £45,000 plus . money for care and everything. 'Then she found others in Norway, . Sweden, Germany and Switzerland but then found the doctor in Belgium . willing to do it - then it was just a case of getting the money. With all these other countries having specialists, we need them in Britain.' She added that her daughter was a good-natured girl who 'would do anything for anyone'. 'She just wanted to help. She was very mischievous and would play pranks on her friends. 'She wanted a Furby for her 28th birthday on December 14 because they were back in fashion. She was still a little girl who liked that kind of thing.' Laura's partner Wayne, 29, said: 'Addenbrooke’s told us that although she was quite poorly she was well enough to go home. 'We thought she was going to go to Belgium and it was going to go ahead. She was just amazed by the generosity of everybody around. In a week and a half they had the £25,000. We think there is £35,000 in the account now and money is still coming in.' He added: 'I only knew her for two years but because of everything that's happened, I feel I’ve known her all my life. 'She was amazing and gorgeous as a person and that’s why I fell for her. We were planning for the future. 'We thought it all was over now we had the money, and were planning on getting married and adopt children.'","Laura Baxter, 27, had been fighting cancer of the appendix for two years .

Drink-drivers who fail a breath test by a small amount could be stripped of their right to a blood or urine test. Ministers aim to remove the statutory right to a second test when a breath test reading is just above the legal limit. This will close the loophole giving drivers time to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken. Some 8 per cent of those arrested for drink-driving opt for a second chance blood test. A quarter of those who have done so in a police station where there is no on-hand doctor have escaped prosecution. A Government consultation document, published by road safety minister Stephen Hammond, says ministers aim to ‘streamline enforcement against drink-driving’. They also plan to give police the option of skipping the secondary breath test, usually conducted at a police station. 'I am determined to make the jobs of those who deal with drink-drivers easier and less bureaucratic so that bringing offenders to justice is not left to chance,' Mr Hammond said. Currently, suspected drink-drivers are given a preliminary test and must then go to the police station for a second test on a breathalyser machine whose results are reliable enough to be used in court as evidence. The Government is hoping to roll out sophisticated mobile roadside ‘evidential’ breath test devices, which will remove the need for a trip to the police station. These devices are not currently in use but are expected to receive Home Office approval next year. The report says: ‘This would mean that an officer can conduct an evidential breath test in places other than at a police station or hospital, including at the roadside, without the need for a preliminary screening test.’ Similar roadside test devices for drug-drivers are also awaiting approval. Mr Hammond said: ‘We have made great . progress in tackling drink-drivers and the 2011 fatality figure for . drink-and-drive accidents is the second lowest ever recorded. ‘However, . last year, 280 people died (in these types of accident), ruining the . lives of families up and down the country, so more needs to be done to . eradicate this menace.’ He said: ‘That is why we are taking forward a package of measures to streamline enforcement against drink-driving.' New plans: A police officer holds a breath test kit. The Government plans to crackdown on drunk motorists who use legal loopholes by choosing a blood or urine sample while they sober up . Currently, . drivers who record less than 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of . breath have the right to demand a blood or urine test - despite being . over the legal limit of 35 microgrammes per 100ml. This . is known as the statutory option. It dates back to the original . introduction of earlier ‘blow in the bag’  breathalyser technology when . there were concerns over reliability. The Government also wants to give registered health care professionals – and not just doctors - greater roles in testing drink-drivers and drug-drivers. They will be able to take evidential blood samples in hospitals and to assess whether a driver may be impaired because of drug. Ministers say this will enable tests to be carried out more swiftly, easing the pressure on doctors who are currently the only professionals with the authority to carry out the tests. Other proposals within the plans include further research into the process used to decide whether a driver banned due to drink-driving can regain their licence. There are also plans for the greater use of powers to seize vehicles to get the most dangerous and irresponsible motorists off the road, including drink-drivers. The moves follow the recent review of drink and drug-driving by Sir Peter North who recommended the removal of the right to demand a blood or urine test as evidence showed people were using it as a delaying tactic. The Government believes that improvements in the accuracy of technology means that this option is no longer necessary. RAC . Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: 'The law is full . of unintended consequences and it seems correct to close a loophole . which allows drink-drivers to escape rightful prosecution. 'In . future the roadside technology is up to an adequate evidential standard . then this is the place to determine if wrong has been done.’","Statutory right to a blood test may be removed under new plans announced by road safety minister  Stephen Hammond .

Stephen Dorrell: The former health secretary arranged for friends to buy the flat so he could rent it back from them . A Senior Tory MP who is investigating the care system sold his flat to the owners of a chain of nursing homes and now rents it back at taxpayers’ expense, it was reported last night. Stephen Dorrell, chairman of the health select committee, made a profit of £70,000 from the secret deal. The former health secretary arranged for his friends Linton and Denise Connell to buy the flat two years ago so he could rent it back from them. Last night he said he would be declaring the deal to fellow MPs on the health committee, which started its inquiry into social care in June. Mr and Mrs Connell are directors of St Cloud Care, which runs homes in Worcestershire providing care for 300 people. Labour MP John Mann said Mr Dorrell should consider his position as chairman, adding: ‘[His committee] will want to know what is going on. This raises questions about his independence. He needs to demonstrate that he has no links, personal or professional, to these landlords.’ A spokesman for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority said that it appeared no rules had been broken because MPs are only banned from renting from family members and companies in which they have an interest. Information released by IPSA shows that . Mr Dorrell is renting a second home from Linton and Denise Connell in . central London, paying the pair £17,033 in 2011/12, which works out at . £1,400 a month. The MP, who is currently on a visit to Scandinavia, told the Daily Telegraph he had lived at the one-bedroom flat in Westminster for 33 years, initially renting it from his family before buying it in 2007. After buying it, he claimed for the interest on his mortgage for three years until 2010 when he arranged for the Connells to buy the property after new rules banned MPs from claiming mortgage interest. Land registry records show Mr Dorrell bought the flat, which is in a mansion block, for £280,000. He sold it to the Connells for £350,000. Mr Dorrell said he had not declared the . relationship in the register of members’ interests because he was not . deriving any financial benefit from the arrangement. 'Questions': Mr Dorrell said there was no financial interest because he was paying an 'arm's length' rent for the property .

Are you a folder, a stacker, a hanger, a shover-inner or a hide-away-in-a-drawer kind of person? Exactly how you keep your clothes - and therefore just how tidy your wardrobe is - says a lot about a person. And one award-winning Italian photographer, Pietro Baroni, set out to explore just how much, taking a series of very intimate photographs of some residents of Milan next to their closets, giving the viewer a snapshot into each subject's life. And regardless of what we know about Italian style, it seems the people of Italy's fashion capital have just as many fashion disasters as the rest of us.... The Student: Chiara, a student in Milan, opens her white wardrobe in her pink room and shows the photographer her shoe collection . Baroni travelled all over the Italian city (known for its designer gear and luxury goods) on the hunt for a variety of different people whose styles and fashion blunders would provide an insight into their characters.

There is Chaira the student, whose pink . bedroom contains a white wardrobe full of high-heeled shoes; Denise the . fancy-dress fanatic whose large cupboard is stuffed full of Hello Kitty . get-ups and anime outfits; Glenda the entrepreneur who shares her . bedroom with a cat and dachshund, but keeps her wardrobe to herself and crams it with colourful . dresses and hats; and Suni the glass artist, whose wardrobe is in her . workshop. Baroni also found two retired couples with contrasting closets, a PR man with a fascination with air travel, two journalists - one male, one female - with completely different ways of organising their clothes, a priest, a pair of tattoo artists and a couple of teenage girls. The Cosplayer: Denise the cosplayer (someone who dresses up like an anime character) poses in one of her skimpiest outfits beside a box of Hello Kitty paraphernalia . The unique collection of images, dubbed Milan Closets, has earned the . 35-year-old an honourable mention in the People Lifestyle category of . the 2012 International Photography Awards. He said: 'To the rest of the world Milan is one of the main references for fashion and luxury brands. The true vision of the everyday is almost blocked and hidden by the big names in fashion and design. For this project I wanted to photograph the ordinary Milanese people in front of their open closets. 'They are all different ages, genders, social classes and professions . because I wanted to create a collage of a mixed city that hides its most . intriguing side.

And with them comes the dreaded Christmas Five - the pounds the average woman gains over the festive season. But apparently we no longer have to simply sit back (by a crackling fire, with an eggnog and mince pie in hand, of course) and watch this happen. Glamour model Nicola McLean has staged a pre-emptive strike against Santa's bulge, treating herself to a round of liposuction to blast her muffin tops before Christmas. Scroll down for video . Attack the bulge: Nicola McLean getting a non-invasive Lipoglaze treatment in London's Harley Street, in attempt to stave off the 5lbs she expects to gain over Christmas . The former I'm A Celebrity.... and Celebrity Big Brother contestant hopes to ensure that once 2013 rolls around she's already back to the size she is now. Research shows that the average woman gails 5lb over the Christmas and New Year holiday thanks to an excess of brandy butter, potatoes roasted in goose fat, candy canes and alcohol. But rather than waiting until January to shed that extra flab, stars worried about their figures - including Antony Costa of once-defunct boy band Blue, and former WAG Lizzie Cundy - are getting the lipo lasers out in November. One Harley Street clinic has seen a 33 per cent rise in bookings for its non-invasive liposuction procedure in the run-up to Christmas. Feel the love (handles): Glamour model Nicole McLean pinches her muffin tops before the non-invasive operation . The 32-year-old mother-of-two, who is married to Notts County footballer Tom Williams, had the Lipoglaze treatment on London's Harley Street at the LoveLite clinic. She said: 'We all need a bit of help shifting those stubborn areas of fat - even if, like me, you eat well and exercise regularly. 'I decided to have the treatment now because I know with two hungry young boys and a footballer husband, there is going to be so much pigging out at Christmas. 'If I get working on my muffin tops now I’ll have a bit of a ""get out of jail free"" card and won't be so guilty if I put on a few pounds at Christmas. 'I know that if I do put on a few pounds  my muffin tops will only go back to the old shape because Lipoglaze has made them much smaller. I guess you could call it my little ""insurance policy"".' Santa's little helper: Nicola McLean, pictured with Father Christmas, left, and on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.... in 2008, hopes her round of pre-emptive liposuction will allow her to indulge at the festive dinner table . Lipoglaze is a new technique which has . become increasingly popular with both men and women who want a quick . beauty fix but and don't want to go under the knife. It can help stubborn areas like muffin tops and bingo wings in one 60-minute session by using a cyrongenic machine which works by first gently heating and then rapidly cooling the target area. This causes the fat cells to crystallise and, as a result, fatty deposits are permanently destroyed. The body then naturally eliminates them as waste tissue over the next few weeks. Donnamarie McBride, co-founder of LoveLite, said: 'We have found that November and December have become really busy periods. 'Lots of women know that they are going to put on a few pounds over Christmas and they want to take action now rather wait till the New Year. They know if they look fantastic before Christmas it is an incentive to go easy on the turkey and the pigs-in-blankets.'",Harley Street clinic reports 33 per cent rise in pre-Christmas liposuction .

'I want my legacy to be about charity and . helping children. This is my start.' His foray into philanthropy is a far cry from the dangerous, excessive passions of his younger years. In his turbulent life Tyson has been married three times, fathered eight children and became the youngest heavyweight champion the world has ever seen at just 20. But fame ruined him and his troubled upbringing - his mother was a prostitute and he never knew his pimp father - came back to haunt him. He . used to keep a white Bengal Tiger named Kenya in his backyard. It cost . him around £2,000 a month just to care for him, and the story goes that . one day Kenya got loose and caused quite a commotion in Southington, . Ohio. He was also in . the grip of numerous addictions; to sex, often with strippers and . prostitutes, even though he was married with children; and to spending . on an improbable scale. He spent around £200million, much of it . on gifts to people he barely knew, on cars he never drove, and on bad . business deals which he barely troubled to understand.

There is nobody there telling me that I’m doing too much.' After years of controversial headlines, . at the age of 39, Tyson retired in 2005 – but he admits he’s ‘the same . guy – I just grew up a little bit’. He has spent his recent years trying to reconnect with his six children by four different mothers.

Locked up: Mike Tyson leaves court after being convicted of raping beauty queen Desiree Washington, which he has always denied. He was jailed in 1992 . Xochitl, 34, tried to revive her daughter with CPR, but the youngster never regained consciousness. Tyson, who does not live with the family, rushed from his home in Las Vegas to be by his daughter's bedside. He spent the night at the hospital  -  where his daughter was on a life-support machine  -  and had been warned by doctors at St Joseph Hospital in Phoenix his daughter had a less than a 50-50 chance of recovering. He and Xochitl were at the bedside when the youngster lost her fight for life, and did not return to the family home following their daughter's death. Reflecting on his life Tyson told Las Vegas Weekly in April that he is now the happiest he has ever been, and is just trying to be a good husband to his third wife, and a good father to his children. Tyson said: ‘In order to wear the crown, you have to have a miserable life, and that is the one that inherits the crown. ‘I don’t know, you have to go from the worst to reach the best. I’m just that extreme type of person. That is who I am, the guy that has no limits.’","Former world heavyweight champion has launched the Mike Tyson Cares Foundation .

A whole lottery trouble: Teenager Josh Sargeant pictured after winning £500,000 on the McDonald's Monopoly game which he used to buy a house in an upmarket cul-de-sac . When Josh Sargeant won £500,000 in a fast-food promotion, he sensibly invested much of the money in property. His new neighbours, however, did not get such a good deal. Within weeks of arriving in their quiet cul de sac, the 19-year-old had installed a garden hot tub, was holding late-night parties and was welcoming up to six visitors an hour. His neighbours told a court yesterday of loud music, engines revving, doors slamming, bad language and suspected drug abuse. One said the teenager had so many visitors day and night that she felt like she was ‘living in the car park at Tesco’. The teenager was taken to court by his local council after he breached the terms of a good behaviour contract drawn up in response to the residents’ concerns. The judge yesterday imposed a two-year antisocial behaviour order banning Sargeant from playing loud music and holding excessively noisy parties. He could be jailed for up to five years if he breaches the order. Sargeant had planned to start a gardening business with some of the cash that he won on a Monopoly game at McDonald’s in March 2011. Instead he began to live off the rental income from a second property. Neighbours in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, queued up to give evidence against him at the hearing. Anne Hutchinson, 63, told Lincoln magistrates: ‘It’s a living nightmare for all the people who have struggled to buy a house in what was a nice cul de sac. ‘It is the noise and the traffic and the slamming of car doors. 'It is the swearing and the behaviour of everybody that goes to that house. 'Cars are going in and out of the property seven or eight times a night. 'I’m two doors away and I can hear it. It happens whenever he has friends round.’ Nicola Norman, who lives next door to Sargeant, approached the police and council after suffering ‘many’ sleepless nights. ‘At one point I had five nights in a row when I didn’t get any sleep,’ she said. ‘It got to the point where I had to go and stay with friends so that I could guarantee getting some sleep.’ A third neighbour, Sarah Brown, a financial adviser, said: ‘It’s extremely disturbing. It’s the noise disruption, the driving and the shouting. 'There have been incidents of fighting in the driveway.’ Splashed the cash: Sargeant bought his home for £185,000 in August 2011 and also owns a buy-to-let property for around £180,000. He has blown most of the remainder of the winnings . James Carter, for North Kesteven . council, told the court that although Sargeant’s behaviour had improved . in the weeks leading up to the hearing an Asbo was necessary to prevent . further problems. A council source told the Daily Mail that a neighbour filmed two men inside Sargeant’s kitchen apparently taking cocaine. Police executed a search warrant at the house but found no evidence of the drug. Sargeant left his parents’ home after . paying £185,000 in cash for the four-bedroom house on the new estate. He is believed to have spent a similar amount on his buy-to-let property . but to have spent much of the rest of his winnings. 'It's a living nightmare': Neighbours of Sargeant's detached house (above) in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, complained of loud music, late-night parties, cars revving, bad language and drug taking . He claimed he had put a stop to the . parties, stopped socialising with unsavoury ‘hangers-on’ and had evicted . an unruly tenant. He said he had also sold off the hot tub, which was a . source of much of the noise. The council’s Heidi Ryder said the . court’s verdict was ‘proof’ that anti-social behaviour was ‘not . acceptable and will not be tolerated.’ Outside court, Mrs Hutchinson said she was relieved the Asbo had been granted. ‘It was one of the nicest streets in town but people were being made ill by what was going on,’ she said. ‘You never knew when it was going to start or when it would finish. I hope now that Josh listens and behaves himself.’ Windfall from grace: Sargeant (pictured, left, leaving court today) was just 17 when he won a fortune on the fast food giant's Monopoly Game in April 2011 (right) Sargeant was ordered to pay £2,000 court costs. He was just 17 when he won the £500,000 Monopoly prize at the Sleaford branch of McDonald’s. Owing to his age the prize had to be claimed by his father, Garry, who was with him in court yesterday.","Josh Sargeant scooped jackpot on food giant's Monopoly game aged 17 .

The company describe their pieces - each of which are signedand numbered, and come with a certificate of authenticity - as 'designed by Pitt, built by Pollaro'. The relationship between Pitt and Polllaro began in 2008 when the actor commissioned a custom desk from Pollaro Custom Furniture. The Pitt-Pollaro website explains: 'Frank Pollaro personally delivered the desk to Brad's chateau in the south of France. 'During the installation, Brad and Frank found that they had a common passion for furniture and fine details. They discussed design history and their appreciation of materials, old and new. Most importantly, they shared a commitment to perfection. 'During their discussion, Frank noticed a design sketch book on a nearby table. Intrigued by the hundreds of sketches that Brad had created over a ten-year period, Frank encouraged Brad to allow Pollaro to transform his drawings into three-dimensions.' The pair began to work together on furniture designs, and over a four year period created the limited edition collection at Pitt's house in France. The pieces they have created include a marble bathtub, built for two and shaped like a bottom; a number of glass tables with complex stainless steel legs; a sloping bed built from wood and leather from stingray skin; armchairs made from white plastic and fake fur; higgeldy-piggeldy cabinets . Each piece is numbered and signed by both Pitt and Pollaro, and more items will be added to the collection as they are created. The partners are also open to creating custom commissions. To view the whole collection or enquire about purchasing a piece, visit the Pitt-Pollaro website. A bath made for two: Shaped like a bottom, this is the marble bath designed by Brad Pitt . Sleepy?

A pensioner has been told her post will not be delivered to her door anymore - because the footpath she uses every day is 'too slippy'. Enid Sugden, 82, said Royal Mail only told her workers were refusing to deliver to her house after she rang them to say no mail had arrived in weeks. Royal Mail told her the path was 'hazardous'. The grandmother-of-five, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, said: 'This house is 300 years old and post has been delivered for most of that time. I’ve lived here 50 years and not had any problems before. Disgruntled: Enid Sugden stands in front of the path leading to her home that Royal Mail say is too slippery to use. She said it is the first problem she has had in 50 years of living there . 'They said the footpath’s slippy. It’s regularly used by locals and there’s not a problem.' Royal Mail offered to deliver to one of the neighbouring houses but Mrs Sugden refused because she said it would be too much trouble for her neighbours. Company spokeswoman Felicity McFarlane said the decision was made after a postwoman slipped and injured herself on stepping stones covered in algae and moss six weeks ago. She said: 'Unfortunately, the narrow road is also in the same condition and hazardous for the same reason. Suspension of delivery is always a last resort for Royal Mail. 'The arrangement is in place where the postman or postwoman will deliver mail when conditions underfoot are dry via the road.We have also offered the customer to have her mail delivered to a nearby address. This offer has not been taken up.' The news comes as the postal group pledged to take more action against owners of dogs that attack workers. Following a report published today, Royal Mail said it will actively pursue legal action against the owners of dangerous dogs and take a more 'robust' approach to suspending deliveries to addresses where attacks take place. Law change: A new independent report says new legislation is needed to target owners of dangerous dogs. Postal workers are attacked by dogs more than 3,000 times a year . Royal Mail said more than 3,000 workers were attacked by dogs in the year to April, although the Communication Workers Union said the true figure was closer to 5,000. Former High Court judge Sir Gordon Langley's report recommends new legislation be introduced to provide tougher legal sanctions against owners of dangerous dogs. The independent report pointed out that action cannot be taken if an attack takes place on private property, limiting legal protection available to postmen and women. New laws have already been introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with legislation planned in Wales. Sir Gordon said the frequency of attacks was a 'matter of real concern' especially as there had been no law change despite a 'general agreement' on the inadequacies of the current law. Royal Mail chairman Donald Brydon welcomed the report and said: 'Dog attacks cause injuries and terrible trauma to our staff.'","Grandmother-of-five Enid Sugden said post has been delivered to her West Yorkshire home without problem for 50 years .

Lingerie has always been a popular Christmas gift for a man to give his girlfriend or wife. But that doesn't mean he ever gets it right. Over £100m-worth of 'lingerie let-downs' lie gathering dust under beds and in the bottom of drawers thanks to bad choices made by men when it comes to purchasing underwear gifts for the women in their lives, according to new research. You're pants: Men splash out an average of £42 per underwear set for their wives or girlfriends, but one in five women never wear them . The nationwide study reveled that two-thirds of British women have received lingerie as a present from their partner, with men splashing . out an average of £42 per set. Yet, one in five women have never worn . the gift, and 23 percent said they’d worn it only once. 1. Crotchless knickers - 58% . 2. Leather PVC knickers - 58% . 3. Edible underwear - 44% . 4. Fishnets - 42% . The poll of 1,600 British women by designer lingerie destination Fox & Rose also found that the underwear women most dread receiving are crotchless underpants, followed by leather lingerie and edible smalls. Amanda Lorenzani, co-founder of Fox & Rose said: 'For many men, . lingerie is a confusing and intimidating world, but it's crucial they . make the right choices if they want smiles rather than slaps on . Christmas day. 'Men should ask themselves, is my partner a fashion . trendsetter or a classic dresser? What's her personality type - wild and . dominating or demure and dainty? And of course, the all important . sneaky peak in her lingerie draw to find out her correct size!' The study also showed that older doesn’t necessarily mean wiser when it comes to lingerie - 40 per cent of . women aged 45 to 54 have never worn their gift of lingerie, double the national average. A helping hand: To help men choose lingerie gifts that really hit the spot, Fox & . Rose has launched its free Gentlemen's Lingerie Lifelines advice site . Regionally, women from Edinburgh are most satisfied with their lingerie gifts, . with all respondents in the Scottish city having worn their lingerie at least . once.

Ms Lorenzani continued: 'Fifty Shades of Grey has certainly generated . demand for more adventurous lingerie sets, but the line between sexy and . sordid is very fine. 'Every woman wants to feel great about herself and . receiving the right lingerie set can do that. Men need to be asking . themselves just a few simple questions to ensure their partner feels . like Brigitte Bardot as opposed to Jenna Jameson in their lingerie . gift.' The poll also asked women which types of lingerie styles they most . dreaded receiving, with crotch- less knickers (60%), Leather/PVC (58%), . Edible (44%) and fishnets (42%) ranked as the most unpopular gifts. A brouhaha over bras: Play it safe and choose something your partner is likely to wear . 1 Know her sizeCheck her underwear drawer to get the right sizes. It's sneaky but works wonders. Look at the labels to find out what bra size and knicker size she wears. If that's not possible and she has protected all her clothing with deadlocks, choose a beautiful silk robe.2 Be taste sensitiveThis will bring you serious brownie points. What style of knicker does she normally wear? Does she like little thongs, short style knickers or a classic lace knicker? If she's not a fan of red suspenders, don't try and tempt her out of her comfort zone. If she is feminine, go for one of the stunning nude or pale lingerie sets and show her you pay attention. If she's a seductress opt for a more sultry look in classic black. At Fox & Rose we've made this easier for you. Just Shop By Fox if she is a vamp or Shop By Rose if she is elegantly feminine. And don't forget most women are both!3 Make it specialDesigner lingerie is a treat. We find that men either veer towards safe options or opt for ill-fitting and (usually) unwanted crotchless knickers! Most women enjoy receiving beautiful underwear they wouldn’t necessarily buy themselves. Be bold, go for something versatile and different. Try a flowing yet sexy negligee (often referred to as a babydoll dress) paired with a minimal thong for a luxuriously sensual look, for example.  If you're stuck, opt for the Fox & Rose ethos and buy her something bold and edgy as well as something classic and feminine and cover both looks. Questions to ask: What style of knicker does she normally wear? Does she like little thongs, short style knickers or a classic lace knicker?

Go for a vintage inspired look with high waisted . knickers or corset style bra to accentuate your lover's assets. Or opt . for a limited edition print. Some labels such as Stella McCartney . Lingerie, La Perla and Ell & Cee are fashion-inspired and you'll . demonstrate some serious style knowledge if you manage to channel this . season's key trends into her designer lingerie collection.

Eurozone finance chiefs have struck a deal with the International Monetary Fund that will see Greek debt reduced and the next installment of a bailout loan paid to the debt ridden country. Ministers took 12 hours to thrash out the agreement in Brussels last night, which will see Greece paid £36billion in bailout money next month. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras welcomed the news as a 'great victory' for his country. Deal: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said that news of the agreement was a 'great victory' for his country, while leader of the Eurozone finance ministers group Jean-Claude Juncker lauded the Greeks for hauling their country back from the brink . He said: 'As Greeks, we fought together. And tomorrow a new day begins for all Greeks.' It was the third time in two weeks that finance ministers from the 17 countries that use the Euro had met to hammer out an agreement. The EU lauded all Greeks for hauling their country back from the brink. Leader of the eurozone finance ministers' group, Jean-Claude Juncker said: 'We strongly believe in the Greek capacity to recover. The Greek people are courageous people. 'They are willing to bring their country back on the path of growth.' The so-called troika of the European Central Bank, IMF and the European Commission, which is the 27-country EU's executive arm, have twice agreed to bail out Greece, pledging a total of 240 billion euro, the equivalent of £194billion, in rescue loans - of which the country has received about 150billion (£121billion) so far. In return for its bailout loans, Greece has had to impose several rounds of austerity measures and submit its economy to scrutiny. Greece is predicted to enter its sixth year of recession shortly and has a quarter of its workforce out of a job, and there had been fears it might be forced to drop out of the eurozone, destabilising other countries in the process. The next installment of bailout payments will be given to the country on December 13.

Sussex, originally claimed to have added value to the work, but pleaded . guilty to causing criminal damage in excess of £5,000 on Sunday October . 7th when he appeared before magistrates. Art? Mr Umanets insists his graffiti is part of a movement called 'Yellowism' The defaced painting was one of a . series, known as the Seagram murals, gifted to the Tate by the artist in . 1969, just before his death. The court heard because the painting . has never been sold it has no formal value, but experts have estimated . it to be around £50million. Restorers will now have to . painstakingly strip away the damaged layers, which the pen soaked . through right to the back of the canvas, and re-build them in imitation . of Rothko’s workings, a process which the gallery has confirmed could . take 18 months. Gregor McKinlay, prosecuting, said: . 'This is something that will, because of what’s happened, suffer a . reduction in overall value. 'This is something that simply cannot be restored to its original state because it is an original work of art.' Eminent: The defaced painting was one of a series, known as the Seagram murals, gifted to the Tate by the Mark Rothko, left, in 1969, just before his death. Pictured right is the Tate modern, where the attack took place . However, Mr Morgan said: 'The court . should proceed to sentence the defendant on the remedial costs, the . restoration costs, which are set to some £200,000, rather than at the . suggested value of reduction. Umaniec founded the ‘Yellowist’ movement which describes itself as 'not art or anti-art', with Marcin Lodyga. After the vandalism Lodgya wrote on their website: 'Unfortunately Tate will not keep the . inscription and therefore will 'deface' something very special. 'But, regardless of what Tate will do with it, Rothko’s painting will be always remembered as a potential piece of yellowism.' Influential: Work by Rothko regularly sells for tens of millions of pounds. (Left) his 1954 Homage to Matisse and (right) For Reds, from 1957 . Targeted: The vandalised artwork, right, has been valued at ten million pounds . Judge Robert Fraser said it was . 'inescapable' that the reduction in value would have to be taken into . account at sentence. It will be decided later today whether a Newton . hearing will take place. But Judge Robert Fraser, who will not be carrying out the sentence, said that 'at this stage' such a hearing was unnecessary. He . warned Umaniec: 'This is a very serious matter. You do face the . likelihood of an immediate custodial sentence. I don’t want you to go . away with any false hopes.' Leaving . court Umaniec said he did not wish to speak to the press. Adding: 'I . don’t want to be known in the context of this case where everybody . thinks of me as a bad guy.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Wlodzimierz Umaniec appeared in court after admitting scribbling his name on £50m work in name of 'Yellowism'

Controversial footballer Joey Barton has exposed himself to ridicule by conducting an interview in English with a bizarre French accent. Barton, 30, spoke for more than a minute in an accent reminiscent of 'Allo 'Allo! after making his loan league debut for Olympique de Marseille against Lille. And he also insulted his host country by describing, in Franglais, French football as 'boring', saying: 'Maybe the one criticism of the French Ligue is it's a leetle bit boring'. The QPR midfielder's toe-curling display did little to substantiate his previous claim that he was 'too intelligent to be a footballer'. Scroll down for video . Gaffe: Joey Barton spoke in a French accent at the press conference after his league debut for Marseille . Seriously? Barton made a similar gaffe to former England manager Steve McClaren when he spoke in a faux Dutch accent . All smiles: Barton joked with the French media in the press conference . VIDEO: WATCH JOEY BARTON'S HILARIOUS FRENCH ACCENT . In the accented interview Barton said: 'For me it's important that people speak about the qualities I bring as a footballer.' Barton's embarrassing display evoked memories of both 'Allo 'Allo!'s Officer Crabtree, and, in real life, the hilarious interview former England boss Steve McClaren gave in 2008 when he spoke English in a Dutch accent when managing Dutch side FC Twente. Barton, who earns around £3m a year, seemed aware of the comparison . between his performance and the popular 'Allo 'Allo . character - as well as McClaren. Following the interview, Barton tweeted: 'Steve MaClaren (sic) eat your heart out...' 'In my defence, it is very difficult to do a . press conference in Scouse for a room full of French journalists. The . alternative is to speak...like a 'Allo Allo!' character which is choose [sic]. Its simply a case of you had to be there. #youstupidwomen!' Applause: Barton is on loan to the French team from British side QPR . A few hours later he decided to up the intellectual tone by tweeting a quote from the German philosopher Nietzsche. He also came up with a novel name for the language, and said: 'I am christening this new language Bartonese...' Speaking in France before his league . debut, Barton said: 'Perhaps I shouldn't say it, but I'm maybe a little . too intelligent to be a footballer.' Oh 'Allo! Barton sounded alarmingly like Officer Crabtree from the hit television series . The claims in a French newspaper attracted derision from former Arsenal and Manchester United player Mikael Silvestre. On Twitter, he wrote: 'The uneducated Joey Barton is fascinating for the degree of his stupidity, his ego and his megalomania!'

At first they competed on price, with one offering his products cheaper than the other. But within weeks the conflict erupted into violence, with a window smashed by flying tyre irons, an assault and one van ramming the other. Scroll down to watch video . Caught on camera: Zeheer Ramzan, 32, approaches the van of his rival with a tyre lever in his right hand . Criminal damage: Ramzan then hits Mr Whippy's window shattering the glass over the street . An onlooker filmed the extraordinary . confrontation and placed the video on the YouTube website where it has . so far received 1million viewings. Yesterday the clash left Mr Yummy – . Zeheer Ramzan – facing jail after the dramatic feud was described at . Blackburn Magistrates’ Court. Ramzan, 32, was convicted of assault, possession of an offensive weapon and criminal damage. He will be sentenced next month. The court heard that Mohammed Mulla, 41, had operated his Mr Whippy van for 12 years in the Lancashire town. Smash: Mr Whippy then drives into the back of Mr Yummy's van parked in front of him . Stand-off: Mr Yummy then returns to his van and drives off down the street closely followed by Mr Whippy . In March, Ramzan, who lives 30 miles . away in Halifax and was selling ices on a commission basis, arrived at a . school where Mr Mulla operated. Mr Mulla told him: ‘You can’t come and . trade here.’ He also complained to Ramzan’s employers that he was . driving dangerously. Ramzan was not deterred, however, and . the two men vied for customers. Locals said one would offer four . two-scoop cones with a chocolate flake for £2, after which the other . would offer the same deal for 10p cheaper. Matters came to a head on June 2 when . Mr Mulla pulled into a street to find the Mr Yummy van already parked in . front of him. Mohammed Mobeen Yaseem, who filmed the confrontation on . his mobile phone, said: ‘I heard shouting and I saw the driver of the . front vehicle come out. ‘He seemed very threatening and . approached Mr Whippy. He had a tyre iron – that’s when I pulled the . phone out and started recording.’ He said Mr Whippy had been serving a small child when Mr Yummy approached ‘using the F-word’. ‘He was obviously angry, I couldn’t hear what the commotion was about but there was a lot of swearing going on.’ A blow from the tyre iron smashed Mr . Whippy’s side window, causing a shower of glass shards which damaged Mr . Mulla’s eye, the court heard. He also needed hospital treatment for injuries from a forceful blow to his arm. Almost immediately his van lurched . forward, ramming the rear corner of Ramzan’s. Ramzan got into his van . and drove off, followed by his rival. Giving evidence from behind a screen, . father-of-three Mr Mulla said: ‘Mr Ramzan came towards the vehicle with a . metal bar. I haven’t said anything, I did not swear or say anything – . it was Ramzan swearing.’ Ramzan told the court he had picked up . the wrench because he felt scared and did not actually hit his rival . with it. It was just to show him I had it – I had no intention of . hitting him with it. Ice cream war: Mr Yummy Zeheer Ramzan, left, was . found guilty of assault, possession of an offensive weapon and criminal . damage after attacking his rival ice cream vendor Mr Whippy Mohammed . Mulla, pictured right . ‘I was tapping on the window, using not that much force. I did not pull my hand back.’ He added: ‘It is not me, I have never . done this kind of stuff before in my life. I did not hit him with the . bar at all. I showed him what I had just to scare him. I wasn’t . threatening towards him.’ Ramzan added that Mr Mulla had then driven ‘straight into the back of my van’. ‘He was reversing and I saw that there . was a bump on the front.’ He went to the police the day after the clash . and reported that Mr Mulla had deliberately crashed into him. However . Edward Harrison, prosecuting, told magistrates that with glass showered . over Mr Mulla, ‘it is hardly surprising that he puts the vehicle in gear . and hits the defendant’s vehicle at low speed. It was done out of panic . and understandable in the circumstances.’ He added that Ramzan was  making up . allegations against his rival to try to blacken his name and ruin his . business. ‘He is out to cause problems for Mr Mulla and he thought he . was going to get away with it. This defendant has absolutely no . credibility – he has gone from lie to lie.’ The local licensing committee has now ruled that neither van can go within 50 metres of another trader.","Mr Yummy Zeheer Ramzan, 32, attacked the van of Mr Whippy Mohammed Mulla, 41, for trading in 'his patch'

As one of Africa's deadliest hunters, you might think tourists would be a tad intimidated by coming face-to-face with a cheetah. But one group of big game watchers in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve had no option but to get up close and personal with the world's fastest land animal. Expecting to only admire the animal from afar, the group was taken aback when the spotted cat pounced on its 4x4 and sat only inches away. Strike a pose: The cheetah unexpectedly pounced on the big game watchers' 4x4 in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve . She's a natural: Amateur photographer Dr Serhat Demiroglu captured the amazing moment, as the female cheetah struck poses only inches from the amazed tourists . Close-up: Dr Serhat Demiroglu captured the cheetah from only inches away. The doctor, from Bodrum, Turkey, said the animal was so close he could feel its breath . Rather than trying to intimidate or analyse the group of stunned . tourists, the female cheetah struck up a number of poses as they began to take pictures. Amateur photographer Dr Serhat Demiroglu,44, could not believe his luck when the cat pounced on the vehicle. The doctor, from Bodrum, Turkey, was able to take a number of close-ups of the cat through the vehicle's sun roof, before it left and jumped on a second truck full of tourists . Dr Demiroglu described the incident as 'a bit of a dream' and said the cat was so close he could feel its breath. Cat on a hot tin roof: A tourist poses beside the female cheetah, which is the world's fastest land animal and a deadly hunter . Elegant: The tourists described the animal as 'very friendly' and said that the cheetah showed 'no aggression at all' He said: 'l was taking photos of a cheetah and her cub when she started getting very close to our vehicle. Within a second she had jumped on to the roof which was totally open. He added: 'l couldn't do anything for the first minutes as it felt like a bit of a dream. 'Than l remembered my camera and started taking some shots while thinking ""has anybody seen a cheetah from this angle before?""' After about 20 minutes the cheetah hopped from Serhat's vehicle and on to another 4x4 close by. The cat stayed on one of the vehicles for 20 minutes before leaving and jumping onto another tourist vehicle nearby . Into the sunset: After posing for the tourists, the female jumped off the vehicle and walked towards the sunset on the Maasai Mara . 'My driver said he had never seen anything like it in 10 years.' said Dr Demiroglu. 'The cheetah didn't show any sign of aggression at all, was very friendly actually. If she wanted, she could easily have harmed me.' The cat's brazen behaviour and comfortable nature around the tourists is not all that surprising given that the animals were once kept by humans as pets. Rulers in Ancient Egypt partly domesticated the animals and even tamed them for hunting. Hooded cheetahs would be transported to hunting grounds, where dogs would first flush out the prey. As cheetahs hunt by sight, rather than scent, they would then be released to chase down the prey. Their domestication was also adopted by the Persians and other leaders such as Genghis Khan, Akbhar the Great and Charlemagne.","Amateur photographer Dr Serhat Demiroglu, 44, captured the images .

Westminster Magistrates Court heard how the incident could have been the result of a 'psychotic episode'. On his head: Police were forced to close an entire section of the road - which runs between the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square - while specialist officers tried to coax the man down . Mr Motrescu, a Ukrainian national of no . fixed address, has been charged with possessing an offensive weapon in a . public place, criminal damage and a public order offence. During the incident he is said to have 'attacked' the Duke, breaking his sword off and then attempting to decapitate him. Appearing in court, Mr Motrescu looked disheveled and exposed his stomach as he walked into the dock. He refused to cooperate with the proceedings and the court was told he sacked his solicitor this morning. Describing . the incident prosecutor Darren Watts said: 'Officers attended the scene . which is in Whitehall and came across a bag that had been abandoned.

Arkansas police have arrested a neighbor in the killing of a six-year-old girl whose body was found two days before Thanksgiving. Zachary Dewayne Holly, 28, of Bentonville, Arkansas, is being charged with capital murder, kidnapping and residential burglary and is being held in the local county jail. Little Jersey Bridgeman was reported missing the morning of November 20, and her body was found minutes after a search began in an abandoned house two doors from her home. Jersey,  whose . father and stepmother were jailed last year for chaining her to a . dresser, disappeared from her bedroom at her home in Bentonville on . Monday night. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Police are questioning sex offenders in the death of 6-year-old girl Jersey Bridgeman whose body was found after she disappeared from her home on Monday night . Tragic: Jersey Bridgeman was chained to a dresser last year by her father and stepmom before moving to live with her biological mother . This booking photo provided by the Benton County Sheriff's office shows Zachary Holly after his Monday arrest . ‘Many questions related to this investigation and arrest will be answered by the affidavit of probable cause, which will be released on Wednesday,’ said Police Chief Jon Simpson. Simpson said work by the State Crime Lab helped speed the arrest, but he did not reveal how Jersey was killed or release other details about her death or what led police to Holly. Simpson said Holly will have a bail and probable cause hearing Wednesday, during which a probable cause affidavit will be released. He said the girl's family had been notified about the arrest. Holly lives next door to the six-year-old victim, in between her house and the vacant house where her body was found. Arrested for murder: Zachary Dewayne Holly with his wife Amanda Jo Holly . Newly weds: Zachary Dewayne Holly and Amanda Jo Holly were married in March, according to their Facebook pages . Holly, 26, states on his Facebook page that he lives with his wife Amanda Jo Holly and her four-year-old son and that he graduated from Huntsville High School in Texas in 2004. Amanda Jo Holly is Facebook friends with Jersey’s biological mother, DesaRae Bridgeman. Bridgeman said she last saw her daughter around midnight, before reporting her missing around 6.30am. Authorities found her body approximately 10 minutes later. After Jersey's body was found, investigators searched the home where she lived and the house where her body was found, as well as the homes in between. The FBI was . brought in to assist in the investigation. Meanwhile, it is still unclear where DesaRae Bridgeman was at the time of the missing persons call. Bentonville police said on Friday that certain details of the case were being withheld 'to maintain the integrity of the investigation'. Birthday: Jersey turned six-years-old last week . After the arrest of her father and stepmother, Jersey was put under the care of her biological mother. According to police reports, she died between midnight and 6.43 am, when police received the call that the girl had gone missing. Police said the six-year-old had been living with a 'relative' when she went missing. Stepmother Jana Bridgeman, also identified as Jana Slinkard in court records, is serving a 12-year prison sentence, plus three years for a probation revocation, according to online Department of Correction records. David Bridgeman is serving an 18-year prison sentence. Prison records show he has a tattoo that says 'Jersey'. Questions: Police have yet to release a cause of death or a list of suspects and are still attempting to find the whereabouts of Bridgeman's mother and caretaker. Jersey made headlines last year when her father and stepmother chained her to a dresser as part of a punishment. In conversations with childcare specialists, the six-year-old said that she slept on the floor of her parents' room and that she was tied up for misbehaving. Behind Bars: Bridgeman's father was sentenced to 18 years in prison for having chained the girl to a dresser as punishment . 'She said that Jana and David chain her to the dresser because she had gotten up and eaten some pies, cereal, and bread,' Rogers Police Detective Larry Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. He added that the girl 'stated that they put a belt around her waist so that she could not get up and get any food.' The woman who first contacted the police . about possible child endangerment said she saw Jersey tied up to the dresser with a . silver chain, which appeared to be a dog collar. Jersey's father David admitted in court that he did tie up his daughter with a belt but defended his actions by saying that this was to prevent her from getting into medication and other dangerous materials around the house. 'He said that he thinks she may be sleepwalking and that they discussed buying a child gate, but since he does not have a job, they could not afford to buy one at that time,' Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. The father added that he had first cut a belt to fit around his daughter's ankle and added a lock on it after she had broken free. Then after she complained about the pain in her leg, he chained her by the waist instead. 'It should be noted that the chain that David used was approximately one to two feet in length and appeared to be a dog choke collar,' Taylor added. Both Bridgeman's father and stepmother pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, permitting abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor. For their crime, the father is serving an 18-year prison sentence, while the stepmother was sentenced to 12 years. Tragic: Jersey pictured with her biological mother DesaRae Bridgeman. It is not clear where she was when Jersey was reported missing . Shaken: More than 100 people gathered Tuesday to hold a candlelight vigil for Bridgeman. Remembered: The six-year-old was well loved in her community and many describing her as being special. Jersey's death has left her community shaken. The local school district is currently working on ways to address the death and help students cope with the loss. Administrators said they hope to have finalized plan ready by the time classes resume on Monday.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was left needing plastic surgery after suffering serious bite injuries to his cheek, arm and leg. Mother-of-one Emma Gregory laughs after admitting her dog mauled a defenceless eight-year-old boy . After pleading guilty to having a dog . that was dangerously out of control at an earlier hearing, Gregory was . pictured laughing and waving as she left court. But after receiving a 16-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and being banned from keeping a dog for five years at Manchester Crown Court, she said she hadn’t intended to make light of the boy’s ordeal. Gregory, of Openshaw, said: 'I’m truly sorry for the injuries which were caused by Tia and I hope the boy can overcome both the physical and the emotional trauma he suffered. 'I was naive about the dangers of . owning certain breeds of dogs and I have learnt a lot from this.

A student died hours after being sent home from hospital for the fifth time by doctors who said he was 'stressed'. Talented IT student Andrew Moore, 20, was admitted to three different hospitals on five separate occasions in the weeks before his death after collapsing and feeling unwell. His father Peter, from Stockport, said his son was sent home with anti-anxiety drugs and referred to mental health specialists. Andrew Moore, pictured with his father Peter, collapsed and felt unwell in the weeks leading up to his death . Less than 24 hours after his final hospital visit, to Stepping Hill in Stockport, Andrew collapsed at his family home in Cheadle and never regained consciousness. He was taken back to Stepping Hill and pronounced dead two hours later. A post-mortem examination was inconclusive and further tests are under way to establish the cause of his death. His family said Andrew had undergone an operation last year to repair an abnormal connection in a vein between his lungs and heart. There is no suggestion there were any drugs or medication in his system other than a mild asthma medicine. Two hospitals where Andrew was treated - Stepping Hill and Wythenshawe - have now launched investigations into the care he received. Wythenshawe Hospital is reviewing their involvement with the student . Father Peter, 55, of Cheadle, said: 'My son's died and the doctors had ample opportunity to find out what was really wrong with him. Instead they kept telling him he was stressed out and to go home and rest. 'My family are in a lot of pain but we’ve had barely any contact with the hospitals since Andrew’s death and have never got the impression they really want to get to the bottom of it. 'Unfortunately for us the investigation is too little too late, but what really hurts is feeling that my son was so badly let down by the NHS and no-one seems to care.' In September, Andrew was taken to Leighton Hospital, in Crewe, after collapsing while working for a software company in Alsager, Cheshire. Tests failed to find what was wrong with him. Stepping Hill Hospital expressed its 'deepest sympathies' to Andrew's devastated family . The next day, the Manchester Metropolitan University student collapsed again and was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital, where he was prescribed anti-anxiety drug Diazepam. Andrew was taken by ambulance to Wythenshawe on two more occasions after feeling unwell in the following days. His parents claim, on the second occasion, he was so helpless they could not pick him up off the floor. He was then referred by the hospital to Stockport Mental Health Crisis, who advised his family to take him to A&E at Stepping Hill Hospital when he had another episode on the evening of October 11. Doctors took a blood sample from Andrew but after a short chat with a resident psychologist he was discharged, again with a prescription of Diazepam. He collapsed and died just hours later on the afternoon of October 12. A spokesman for Stepping Hill said the hospital wanted to express its 'deepest sympathies' to Andrew’s family. He added: 'Following Andrew’s death we launched an immediate investigation into this incident so that we can fully understand exactly what happened and why. 'While the investigation is ongoing we are unable to comment further, but we are in contact with Andrew’s family and will keep them fully informed of the findings of our investigation.' Brendan Ryan, medical director of Wythenshawe Hospital, added: 'We are sorry to learn of the death of Mr Moore and our condolences go to his family and loved ones. 'I can confirm that Mr Moore presented at our A&E this year and we are reviewing our involvement with him. 'While Stepping Hill Hospital is carrying out an investigation of its own into Mr Moore’s death we are unable to comment any further at this time.' A Leighton Hospital spokesman said the hospital was unaware of Andrew's death and declined to comment further.","Andrew Moore, 20, was sent home from hospital with anti-depressant drugs, claims his father .

Controversial: Hungarian far-right politician Marton Gyongyosi has urged the government to draw up lists of Jews who pose a 'national security risk' A Hungarian far-right politician urged the government to draw up lists of Jews who pose a 'national security risk', stirring outrage among Jewish leaders who saw echoes of fascist policies that led to the Holocaust. Marton Gyongyosi, a leader of Hungary's third-strongest political party Jobbik, said the list was necessary because of heightened tensions following the brief conflict in Gaza and should include members of parliament. Opponents have condemned frequent anti-Semitic slurs and tough rhetoric against the Roma minority by Gyongyosi's party as populist point scoring ahead of elections in 2014. Jobbik has never called publicly for lists of Jews. 'I am a Holocaust survivor,' said Gusztav Zoltai, executive director of the Hungarian Jewish Congregations' Association. 'For people like me this generates raw fear, even though it is clear that this only serves political ends. This is the shame of Europe, the shame of the world.' Between 500,000 and 600,000 Hungarian Jews died in the Holocaust, according to the Holocaust Memorial Centre in Budapest. According to some accounts, one in three Jews killed in Auschwitz were Hungarian nationals. Gyongyosi's call came after Foreign Ministry State Secretary Zsolt Nemeth said Budapest favored a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as benefiting both Israelis with Hungarian ancestry, Hungarian Jews and Palestinians in Hungary. Gyongyosi, who leads Jobbik's foreign policy cabinet, told Parliament: 'I know how many people with Hungarian ancestry live in Israel, and how many Israeli Jews live in Hungary,' according to a video posted on Jobbik's website late on Monday. 'I think such a conflict makes it timely to tally up people of Jewish ancestry who live here, especially in the Hungarian Parliament and the Hungarian government, who, indeed, pose a national security risk to Hungary.' Gyongyosi, 35, is the son of a diplomat . who grew up mostly in the Middle East and Asia -- Egypt, Iraq, . Afghanistan and India -- and whose office is decorated by Iranian and . Turkish souvenirs. He graduated with a degree in business and political . science from Trinity College in Dublin in 2000. 'Raw fear': This picture shows Jews from Hungarian Carpathian Ruthenia . arriving at Auschwitz in May 1944 . He worked for four years at the . Dublin office of KPMG, then returned to Budapest in 2005. He has been . active in Jobbik since 2006 and became their MP in 2010. The government condemned the remarks. 'The government strictly rejects . extremist, racist, anti-Semitic voices of any kind and does everything . to suppress such voices,' the government spokesman's office said. 'I am a Holocaust survivor... For people like me this generates raw fear' Guztav Zoltai, Hungarian Jewish Congregations Association . Laszlo Kover, the Speaker of . parliament, who is from the ruling Fidesz party, also issued a statement . on Tuesday in which he called for a tightening of house rules that . would allow a sanctioning of such behavior. Gyongyosi tried to play down his . comments on Tuesday, saying he was referring to citizens with dual . Israeli-Hungarian citizenship. 'I apologize to my Jewish compatriots for my declarations that could be misunderstood,' he said on Jobbik's website. 'Outrage': According to some accounts, one in three Jews killed in Auschwitz were Hungarian nationals . He later told a news conference that he would not resign and considered the matter 'closed', national news agency MTI reported. Jobbik's anti-Semitic discourse often evokes a centuries-old blood libel - the accusation that Jews used Christians' blood in religious rituals. 'Jobbik has moved from representing medieval superstition (of the blood libel) to openly Nazi ideologies,' wrote Slomo Koves, chief rabbi of the Unified Hungarian Jewish Congregation. 'The government strictly rejects extremist, racist, anti-Semitic voices of any kind' Hungarian government spokesman . Jobbik registered as a political party in 2003, and gained increasing influence as it radicalized gradually, vilifying Jews and the country's 700,000 Roma. The group gained notoriety after founding the Hungarian Guard, an unarmed vigilante group reminiscent of World War Two-era far-right groups. It entered Parliament at the 2010 elections and holds 44 of 386 seats. The centre-right government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban has struggled to pull Hungary out of recession as many European countries suffer from an economic crisis. Orban's Fidesz has lost more than a million voters since 2010, even though it is still the strongest political force. More than half of Hungary's electorate is undecided and having retained its voter base, some analysts say Jobbik could hold the balance of power in the 2014 elections between Fidesz and the fragmented left-wing opposition.","Marton Gyongyosi, a member of Hungary's far-right Jobbik Party, said the list was necessary amid heightened tensions following the conflict in Gaza .

Family, fans and fellow boxers said goodbye Tuesday to Hector 'Macho' Camacho at a memorial and wake for the slain former world champion fighter known for his flamboyance in and out of the ring. Hundreds of people filed past Camacho's open casket, displayed inside a gymnasium decked out for the occasion with black carpet and curtains. The boxer wore white, along with a large gold crucifix and a necklace spelling out his nickname, 'Macho,' in capital letters. First up were members of his immediate family, including his mother, Maria Matias, who wept and caressed her son's face in the coffin, which was draped in a Puerto Rican flag. Scroll down for video . Mourning: Family and friends of Hector 'Macho' Camacho mourned his death at an open-casket wake for the former Puerto Rican welterweight boxing champion . Loss: Maria Matias cries over the body of her son during the wake in San Juan Tuesday . 'They killed him,' she wailed at one point. Camacho was shot Nov. 20 while sitting in a parked car with a friend outside a bar in Bayamon, his hometown. The friend died at the scene and the boxer three days later after doctors removed him from life support. Police have said they have suspects but have not yet arrested anyone for the shooting. After the family, came a cross-section of Puerto Rican society that included parents with young children, the elderly, road crew workers in neon safety vests, U.S. soldiers in uniform and a who's who of Puerto Rican boxers. 'Everybody loved him here in Puerto Rico,' said Henry Neumann, the secretary of the U.S. island territory's sports and recreation department. 'He is one of those athletes who transcended the barriers of his country not only for his skill inside the ring but for his personality.' Final rest: Hector Camacho lies in an open casket during his funeral in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Tuesday . Death: Camacho died after he was shot Nov. 20 while sitting in a parked car with a friend outside a bar in Bayamon, his hometown . Camacho, who was 50 when he died, left Puerto Rico as a child and moved to New York. He went on to win super lightweight, lightweight and junior welterweight world titles in the 1980s and fought high-profile bouts against Felix Trinidad, Julio Cesar Chavez and Sugar Ray Leonard. He had a career record of 79-6-3 and was a showman in the ring, chanting 'It's Macho time' before fights and wearing garish jewelry. He battled drug and alcohol problems throughout his life and had frequent run-ins with police. He was sentenced in 2007 to seven years in prison for the . burglary of a computer store in Mississippi. While arresting him on the . burglary charge in January 2005, police also found the drug ecstasy. A judge eventually suspended all but one year of the sentence and gave . Camacho probation. He wound up serving two weeks in jail, though, after . violating that probation. Memories: Matias, Camacho's mother, laughs as 10-year-old Alexandre Birriel dresses and acts as a young Camacho . When he was shot, police found an open package of cocaine in the car and nine unopened packages on his friend. A police officer in Bayamon, Raul Nazario, recalled at the wake how he saw Camacho one day and drove over in his squad car to greet him, but the boxer fled. Later, out of uniform, the officer said he ran into him again and they exchanged a laugh and Camacho posed with him for a photo. 'For Puerto Rican people he was something great,' Nazario said. Many of those in attendance had similar personal encounters. Doris Correa, a 71-year-old from the town of Vega Baja, showed a photo she took of Camacho in the 1980s, when her family and his happened to be camping in the same campground in the island's southwest. At one point, he grabbed a microphone, declared 'it's Macho time,' and began singing for everyone. Saying goodbye: Hundreds of mourners gathered at Camacho's casket to pay their respects . Last days: Camacho's family decided to take him off life support after doctors found that he was brain dead following the shooting . Tragedy: Matias cried and shouted, 'They killed him,' in refernce to her son's killers. Camacho was killed in a drive-by shooting . 'Back then, we didn't know what karaoke was,' she said. 'He invented it.' Boxer Juan Manuel 'Juanma' Lopez, one of several dozen fighters on hand to say goodbye, recalled Camacho's dazzling speed in the ring. 'He was definitely a showman,' he said. 'It was something grandiose.' The memorial and wake was scheduled to last two days. Family members have not yet announced the location and date of the funeral. His lawyer, Linda George, told Radio Isla 1320 that it would be in New York. Shot while sitting in a parked car outside a bar Tuesday with a friend in the city of Bayamon, he was declared dead at the Centro Medico trauma center in San Juan. Originally from Bayamon, just outside San Juan, Camacho was long regarded as a flashy if volatile talent, a skilled boxer who was perhaps overshadowed by his longtime foil, Mexican superstar Julio Cesar Chavez, who would beat him in a long-awaited showdown in Las Vegas in 1992. 'This is something I've done all my life, you know?' Camacho told The . Associated Press after a workout in 2010. 'A couple years back, when I . was doing it, I was still enjoying it. The competition, to see myself . perform. I know I'm at the age that some people can't do this no more.' Camacho's family moved to New York when he was young and he grew up in . Spanish Harlem, which at the time was rife with crime. Camacho landed in . jail as a teenager before turning to boxing, which for many kids in his . neighborhood provided an outlet for their aggression. Troubled: Camacho battled drug and alcohol problems throughout his life and had frequent run-ins with police . Former featherweight champion Juan Laporte, a friend since childhood, . described Camacho as 'like a little brother who was always getting into . trouble,' but otherwise combined a friendly nature with a powerful jab. 'He's a good human being, a good-hearted person,' Laporte said as he . waited with other friends and members of the boxer's family outside the . hospital in San Juan after the shooting. 'A lot of people think of him . as a cocky person but that was his motto ... inside he was just a kid . looking for something.' Laporte lamented that Camacho never found a mentor outside the boxing ring. 'The people around him didn't have the guts or strength to lead him in . the right direction,' Laporte said. 'There was no one strong enough to . put a hand on his shoulder and tell him how to do it.' Camacho's former wife, Amy, obtained a restraining order against him in . 1998, alleging he threatened her and one of their children. The couple, . who had two children at the time, later divorced. He divided his time between Puerto Rico and Florida in recent years, . appearing on Spanish-language television as well as on a reality show . called 'Es Macho Time!' on YouTube. Retired: Camacho's last title bout came against then-welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya in 1997, a loss by unanimous decision . Inside the boxing ring, Camacho flourished. He won three Golden Gloves . titles as an amateur, and after turning pro, he quickly became a . contender with an all-action style reminiscent of other Puerto Rican . fighters. Long promoted by Don King, Camacho won his first world title by beating . Rafael Limon in a super-featherweight bout in Puerto Rico on Aug. 7, . 1983. He moved up in weight two years later to capture a lightweight . title by defeating Jose Luis Ramirez, and successfully defended the belt . against fellow countryman Edwin Rosario. The Rosario fight, in which the victorious Camacho still took a savage . beating, persuaded him to scale back his ultra-aggressive style in favor . of a more cerebral, defensive approach. The change in style was a big reason that Camacho, at the time 38-0, . lost a close split decision to Greg Haugen at Caesar's Palace in Las . Vegas in 1991. Camacho won the rematch to set up his signature fight against Chavez, . this time at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. Camacho was . roundly criticized for his lack of action, and the Mexican champion won a . lopsided unanimous decision to retain the lightweight title. The champ: Camacho in a Roman solider's uniform . before fighting Sugar Ray Leonard in Atlantic City and after winning the . fight (right) It was at that point that Camacho became the name opponent for other . rising contenders, rather than the headliner fighting for his own glory. He lost a unanimous decision to another young Puerto Rican fighter, . Trinidad, and was soundly defeated by De La Hoya. In 1997, Camacho ended . Leonard's final comeback with a fifth-round knockout. It was Camacho's . last big victory even though he boxed for another decade. 'Hector was a fighter who brought a . lot of excitement to boxing,' said . Ed Brophy, executive director of International the Boxing Hall of Fame.' He was a good champion. Roberto Duran is kind of in a class of his own, . but Hector surely was an exciting fighter that gave his all to the . sport.' The fighter's last title bout came in 1997 against welterweight champion . Oscar De La Hoya, who won by unanimous decision. Camacho's last fight . was his defeat by Duran in May 2010.

A convicted killer, who stabbed a man 40 times in a jealous rage, has been given a job at a hospital. Unions have raised concerns over the employment of Robert Bage at the University Hospital of North Durham after it was revealed his employers had no idea about his violent past. Bage, originally from the Durham area, stabbed Andrew Stanyer in 1991 after becoming jealous of the man’s relationship with his former partner and was jailed for life. No idea of conviction: Robert Bage was jailed for life but after he was released on licence he got a job at the University Hospital of North Durham (pictured) while employers were unaware of his violent past . Following his release from prison on licence he was employed by the County Durham and Darlington NHS Trust hospital in the hospital kitchens, it is believed. In a statement from Balfour Beatty Workplace (BBW), the trust’s Private Finance Initiative partner, said that Bage worked in a ‘non-patient facing role’ but that they were not made aware of his previous convictions during the employment process. The statement read: ‘Once this matter was brought to the attention of BBW, the employee was suspended and an investigation commenced immediately. ‘Mr Bage no longer works with BBW.’ It is believed that he has not worked at the hospital for at least two months. Public service trade union Unison plan to hold talks with staff at the hospital after details of Bage’s employment emerged. Frenzied attack: Bage hid in his former partner's loft in Stoke (pictured) before stabbing Andrew Stanyer 40 times with a kitchen knife . Sheila Wilson, a regional organiser for Unison, said: ‘We are extremely concerned that the recruitment process has allowed this to happen.’ Bage hid in the loft of his former partner’s home in Stoke, Staffordshire before stabbing Mr Stanyer in a frenzied attack, starting when his victim was asleep. Bage was due to be released on licence in March 2005 and was expected to live in the North East. His current whereabouts are unknown. At the time, Mr Stanyer’s brother, Alan, said a life sentence should mean Bage would never be released.

The portfolio manager also admitted making or possessing 61 indecent photographs and distributing one image of children between four and ten-years-old, at Southwark Crown Court today. Parsons, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was found out when a work colleague spotted the iPhone and found recordings of herself and a number of other co-workers as they showered naked. He was identified because there was footage of him setting up and adjusting the phone. Parsons today pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism after two recordings were made between February 17 and 21 this year. Parsons was released on bail today but was warned by Judge Michael Grieve QC: ‘These are serious offences and you will have to accept that custodial sentences are an extremely likely outcome.’ Prosecutor Peter Zinner said of the indecent photographs of children: ‘The making of indecent photographs was for downloading images from the internet. ‘The age range of the children depicted is between four and ten-years-old.’ Parsons resigned from Bestinvest in February after the allegations surfaced. He will be sentenced on January 8 next year. A spokesman for Bestinvest said: ‘Nigel Parsons was a portfolio manager in the investment management team at Bestinvest.

Hector 'Macho' Camacho, a Puerto Rican boxer known for skill and flamboyance in the ring as well as for a messy personal life and run-ins with the police, was declared dead on Saturday, four days after being shot in the face. He was 50. Shot while sitting in a parked car outside a bar Tuesday with a friend in the city of Bayamon, he was declared dead at the Centro Medico trauma center in San Juan. The friend, 49-year-old Adrian Mojica Moreno, died at the scene of the shooting. Police said Mojica had nine small bags of cocaine in his pocket and a 10th bag was found open in the car. Originally from Bayamon, just outside San Juan, Camacho was long regarded as a flashy if volatile talent, a skilled boxer who was perhaps overshadowed by his longtime foil, Mexican superstar Julio Cesar Chavez, who would beat him in a long-awaited showdown in Las Vegas in 1992. Scroll down for video . Shot: Camacho was declared clinically brain dead on Thursday at Centro Medico, the trauma center in San Juan . Agony: The champ's mother Maria Matias announced on Friday night that he would be removed from life support at some point on Saturday . Camacho fought professionally for three decades, from his humble debut . against David Brown at New York's Felt Forum in 1980 to an equally . forgettable swansong against Sal Duran in Kissimmee, Florida, in 2010. In between, he fought some of the biggest stars spanning two eras, . including Sugar Ray Leonard, Felix Trinidad, Oscar De La Hoya and . Roberto Duran. 'This is something I've done all my life, you know?' Camacho told The . Associated Press after a workout in 2010. 'A couple years back, when I . was doing it, I was still enjoying it. The competition, to see myself . perform. I know I'm at the age that some people can't do this no more.' Camacho's family moved to New York when he was young and he grew up in . Spanish Harlem, which at the time was rife with crime. Camacho landed in . jail as a teenager before turning to boxing, which for many kids in his . neighborhood provided an outlet for their aggression. Former featherweight champion Juan Laporte, a friend since childhood, . described Camacho as ""like a little brother who was always getting into . trouble,"" but otherwise combined a friendly nature with a powerful jab. 'He's a good human being, a good hearted person,' Laporte said as he . waited with other friends and members of the boxer's family outside the . hospital in San Juan after the shooting. 'A lot of people think of him . as a cocky person but that was his motto ... inside he was just a kid . looking for something.' Conflict: Camacho's son Hector Jr, right, opposed the decision to end his father's life . Fighter: Camacho's condition worsened overnight at the critical care unit in San Juan . Laporte lamented that Camacho never found a mentor outside the boxing ring. 'The people around him didn't have the guts or strength to lead him in . the right direction,' Laporte said. 'There was no one strong enough to . put a hand on his shoulder and tell him how to do it.' Drug, alcohol and other problems trailed Camacho after the prime of his . boxing career. He was sentenced in 2007 to seven years in prison for the . burglary of a computer store in Mississippi. While arresting him on the . burglary charge in January 2005, police also found the drug ecstasy. A judge eventually suspended all but one year of the sentence and gave . Camacho probation. He wound up serving two weeks in jail, though, after . violating that probation. Fighter: Camacho's son Hector Jr believed that his father was still alive despite the doctors' prognosis. His father was declared dead on Saturday . Grief: The boxing champion's son Hector Camacho Jr was mobbed by reporters as he enters the San Juan hospital this week . Devastating: Hector Camacho, the father of the boxing great, contemplates the agonizing decision to take his son off life support after he was declared brain dead. His son died on Saturday . Camacho's former wife, Amy, obtained a restraining order against him in . 1998, alleging he threatened her and one of their children. The couple, . who had two children at the time, later divorced. He divided his time between Puerto Rico and Florida in recent years, . appearing on Spanish-language television as well as on a reality show . called 'Es Macho Time!' on YouTube. Inside the boxing ring, Camacho flourished. He won three Golden Gloves . titles as an amateur, and after turning pro, he quickly became a . contender with an all-action style reminiscent of other Puerto Rican . fighters. Previous convictions: Adrian Mojica Moreno was reportedly in possession of cocaine when he was shot and killed outside a bar in Puerto Rico . Long promoted by Don King, Camacho won his first world title by beating . Rafael Limon in a super-featherweight bout in Puerto Rico on Aug. 7, . 1983. He moved up in weight two years later to capture a lightweight . title by defeating Jose Luis Ramirez, and successfully defended the belt . against fellow countryman Edwin Rosario. The Rosario fight, in which the victorious Camacho still took a savage . beating, persuaded him to scale back his ultra-aggressive style in favor . of a more cerebral, defensive approach. The change in style was a big reason that Camacho, at the time 38-0, . lost a close split decision to Greg Haugen at Caesar's Palace in Las . Vegas in 1991. Last moments: The boxer's two sisters Esther and Estrella Camacho had asked for more time to spend at their brother's bedside before he was taken off life support . Overwhelmed: Maria Matias, mother of Hector Camacho, is supported as she leaves the San Juan hospital on Friday . Bearer of bad news: Dr Ernesto Torres, director of the Centro Medico trauma center in San Juan, declared that the boxing legend was clinically brain dead on Thursday . Camacho won the rematch to set up his signature fight against Chavez, . this time at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. Camacho was . roundly criticized for his lack of action, and the Mexican champion won a . lopsided unanimous decision to retain the lightweight title. It was at that point that Camacho became the name opponent for other . rising contenders, rather than the headliner fighting for his own glory. He lost a unanimous decision to another young Puerto Rican fighter, . Trinidad, and was soundly defeated by De La Hoya. In 1997, Camacho ended . Leonard's final comeback with a fifth-round knockout. It was Camacho's . last big victory even though he boxed for another decade. Brutal slaying: A friend of the boxer, who has not been identified lies dead on the ground outside the bar where he was also shot . Attack: Camacho was left brain-dead after being shot in the face in the Puerto Rican capital . VIDEO: Camacho's mother's emotional statement as eldest son disagrees with the decision to take his father off life support .

Roberto Duran is kind of in a class of his own, . but Hector surely was an exciting fighter that gave his all to the . sport.' The fighter's last title bout came in 1997 against welterweight champion . Oscar De La Hoya, who won by unanimous decision. Camacho's last fight . was his defeat by Duran in May 2010.

Up to 5,000 staff at electricals chain Comet could be out of a job just a week before Christmas after administrators today announced a further 125 stores will close. Administrators Deloitte said it would only keep the remaining 70 stores open until all remaining stock is sold. Deloitte confirmed it was still in talks . with a 'small number' of interested buyers, but said it was necessary . to begin shutting shops in the absence of a firm offer for the whole . business. More closures: Up to 5,000 staff working for the electricals chain Comet face being out of work come Christmas after administrators announced a further 125 are to be closed . Deloitte is also proposing to close the company's distribution centre in Harlow, Essex, this Friday and will cut back office functions at Rickmansworth, Hull and Clevedon. The distribution centre at Skelmersdale will continue to support the store network. The announcement comes after hopes had been raised of a rescue deal after it emerged Southampton-based entrepreneur Clive Coombes was considering making a bid. Joint-administrator Chris Farrington said: 'We remain in discussions with a small number of interested parties and hope that a positive outcome can still be achieved. 'Should any acceptable offers be received for stores we will delay the closure process. Bargain hunters: Shoppers flocked to Comet stores around the country after it was announced the company was going into administration . 'Unfortunately, in the absence of a firm offer for the whole of the business, it has become necessary to begin making plans in case a sale is not concluded. 'If a sale is not possible we would envisage stores to begin closing in December.' Around 5,000 employees work across the 195 Comet stores, with more than 3,000 jobs expected to be affected by today's decision. But it is understood that unless a buyer is found all stores will close before Christmas with all 5,000 employees losing their jobs. Since Deloitte was appointed to work for the electricals chain, some 1,500 jobs have already been axed. Farrington added: 'We remain extremely grateful to the Company’s employees for their commitment and support during a period of concern and anxiety for them. 'All employees will be paid for the work they do while the Company is in administration and I can confirm that any accrued holiday pay, overtime and bonus earned during the Administration trading period, together with the pre-Administration bonus that was owed to employees at the time of our appointment, will be paid to employees as previously stated. 'A dedicated helpline is in place for all employees and the Company is running an Employee Assistance Programme to help those staff made redundant find other jobs.' He added that Deloitte has contacted more than 35 prospective employers who are 'keen' to offer roles to ex-Comet employees. The collapse of Comet marks one of the biggest high street casualties since the demise of Woolworths in 2008 and came a month after the failure of JJB Sports. The group was hit by weak high street trading conditions, competition from online rivals and being unable to secure the trade credit insurance needed to safeguard suppliers. In particular, it was knocked by the lack of first-time home-buyers, who had been key customers for Comet.","The remaining 70 stores will stay open until all remaining stock is sold .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:54 EST, 28 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:05 EST, 28 November 2012 . Tony Blair said yesterday that Eurosceptics were a ‘virus’ blighting politics and that Britain would be a second-rate power if it left the EU. The former prime minister warned that David Cameron’s policy of trying to repatriate powers would simply pave the way for withdrawal, which was being hastened by some Conservatives. ‘The Right have got it really bad on this Europe thing,’ he told business leaders at Chatham House in London. ‘It is a kind of virus that makes you want to take positions for the sake of asserting them, when a rational analysis says you don’t need to be in that position.’ Former Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that it would be 'a monumental error of statesmanship' for Britain to turn its back on Europe . He said there was a ‘chasm of error’ between understanding that Europe was in crisis, and saying that the logical response was for Britain to leave. While Britain could operate in the global economy outside the EU, he said withdrawal would be a ‘monumental error of statesmanship’, diminishing trade relations with China and India, and influence on decisions about defence, energy and foreign policy. Mr Cameron has indicated that he wants to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU, but is resisting pressure for an in-or-out referendum. Mr Blair added: ‘This is the last moment, the last moment conceivable, that we should start talking about leaving, about quitting the field just as the game starts, marginalising ourselves at the very point at which we should be at the centre of things. ‘Europe is a destiny we will never embrace easily. But it is an absolutely essential part of our nation remaining a world power, politically and economically. He added: 'All my life I've fought ideology on the left. The right have got it really bad on this Europe thing. It's a virus.' But his intervention in the Europe debate attracted a scathing response from Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party. David Cameron last week told journalists a deal on the EU budget had not been reached at a summit in Brussels . 'To hear a man who uses snake oil rather than milk on his cornflakes and was responsible for an illegal war talk about statesmanship is remarkable,' Mr Farag said. 'To hear it when it is a merely poor disguise for a job application for the post of EU President must make any decent citizen feel their skin itch.' Mr Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs to adopt a more Eurosceptic stance, having suffered an embarrassing rebellion when dozens of backbenchers demanded a cut in the EU budget. There is growing speculation that Ed . Miliband may be considering committing Labour to an in/out poll, Mr . Blair said it was not ‘sensible’ to be talking about a referendum at . this point. The Prime . Minister has ruled out an in-out referendum, but has proposed a . renegotiation to bring back powers from Brussels which would then be put . to the British people in a vote. But . Mr Blair said Mr Cameron should ignore the calls from the Tories struck . down by the ideological ‘virus’ of euroscepticism. ‘The right have got . it really bad on this Europe thing,’ he said. He said talk of renegotiating EU membership ‘is the refuge of those who want to leave but want to persuade people that really it’s just an adjustment of our relationship’. He went on: ‘Here it is no longer good enough for us pro-Europeans to claim that the case for departure is made only by atavistic Little Englanders, or to pretend that outside the EU, Britain would collapse or disintegrate. ‘Britain could have a future outside of Europe. The question is whether it should. We should ask, not: could it be done; but is it wise? Is it a sensible judgement in our long-term interests?’ He said leaving the EU would be ‘politically debilitating, economically damaging and hugely destructive of Britain's true long term interests’. In a globalised world that will increasingly be dominated by emerging giants like China and India, Britain needs the ""heft"" of the EU to exert an influence internationally and support its own interests on issues like trade, climate change and defence, he said. And he said the UK can best use its influence to shape the EU by making clear it wishes to remain at its heart.","Former Prime Minister admits Britain could leave the EU but it will be 'hugely destructive'

Madness: Schoolboy ignores warning lights and runs across a level crossing in Crawley, Sussex, on November 22, as the barrier comes down . In a hurry? Couple with baby in pushchair ignore the waring lights to walk over level crossing moments seconds before the safety barriers come down . The reckless pedestrians all ignored warning signs where four people have died in recent years at the crossing in Crawley, Sussex. MP for Crawley Henry Smith said today that the level crossing has been a 'chronic problem' for many years. He said: ""Network Rail have regularly done awareness campaigns, but peoplestill feel the need to jump the gate. 'I have been down there with representatives from Network Rail talking to people about how to be safe and raising awareness. 'People have the 'it won't happen to me' attitude. It is true that 99 per cent of people will get away with it, but it only takes one who does not for there to be a serious accident with tragic consequences. 'Even if the train has slowed down for the nearby station and is only going at 10mph it will still kill a child and probably an adult too. 'That particular crossing has been a chronic problem for several years. There have been horrendous stories of near misses and tragic deaths on the crossing. 'It is not just Crawley that has this problem it is like this across the country.' The British Transport Police (BTP) today warned that the consequences of the schoolboy and parent’s actions could have been 'horrific.' A spokesman for the BTP asked pedestrians and motorists to 'exercise a little patience' at level crossings. Brett . Heath, 19, died instantly from multiple injuries after he was hit by a . train on the crossing after a night out in August 2007. A . mother-of-two Linda Powell, 55, from East Grinstead, Sussex, died . instantly after she was hit by a train at the crossing on May 19, 2009. Then on July 30, 2009, former bus driver Michael Heron, 51, died at the crossing after being hit by a train at 11.23pm. And . a fourth person David Barber, 53, died after he was hit by a train on . the level crossing just before 10am on January 15, 2010. He said: 'The actions of these people are absolutely unbelievable. 'They were clearly willing to risk their lives to nip across the tracks either to get where they were going more quickly or just for the sake of causing mischief. 'This time they were lucky, but we have seen many incidents in which others have not been as fortunate. 'Barriers are in place at level crossings to keep motorists and pedestrians safe from harm and, when used correctly, that is exactly what they achieve. 'However, when barriers and signals are ignored, the consequences can be horrific. We ask all motorists and pedestrians to exercise a little patience.' The shocking picture shows the boy running across the tracks where the railway line crosses Horsham Road close to Goffs Park in Crawley, Sussex, on November 22. His school uniform suggests he is a pupil at the nearby Hazelwick School in Three Bridges, Crawley, Sussex. Headteacher Ann Fearon today said: 'I hope this incident reminds all students - and members of the public - about the importance of road safety. 'We will continue to impress on our students the importance of all aspects of safety. But this isn’t just an issue for the school, it’s an issue for society.'

Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks through unlocked pedestrian gates at Elsenham station in Essex. Judge Turner ruled Network Rail had a 'solemn responsibility' for the safety of members of the public, adding: 'Network Rail, in part by itself and in part through its predecessor Railtrack, failed to ensure that the risks were properly assessed, controlled or managed.' Charlotte Thompson (left), 13 and Olivia Bazlinton, 14, were hit by a train in 2005 at Elsenham train station, Essex . Elsewhere in Britain schoolgirl Katie Littlewood, 15, was struck at high speed while using the pedestrian crossing at Johnson’s Footpath in Bishop’s Stortford, Herts., on January 28, 2012. Nicola Dooris, Network Rail community safety manager, said: 'Despite ongoing safety campaigns, hard-hitting television adverts and rail safety schemes in schools which highlight the dangers, it is disappointing that people of all ages continue to misuse the level crossings in Crawley. 'We appreciate it can be frustrating to wait for trains to pass through but there is no excuse for level-crossing misuse. 'To avoid loss of life, injury, damage to vehicles and causing delays to passengers, always obey the warning sequence and never attempt to cross the railway when it has started.' The shocking pictures of people risking their lives by ignoring the warning signals at level crossing were taken as part of an investigation into dangerous behaviour at the crossing by a local paper. Network Rail statistics show that the number of deaths on level crossings is decreasing from 10 in 2008/2009, eight in 2009/2010, six in 2010/2011 and four in 2011/2012. But Network Rail said despite the decrease they are continually trying to educate people of all ages about the dangers of misusing level crossings.","Transport Police say consequences could .

Ed Miliband faced embarrassment in his crusade against tax avoiders last night after it emerged a key Labour donor has saved millions of pounds by running online gambling from a tax haven. Peter Coates, chairman of bet365, has donated £300,000 to the party in the past decade, including £10,000  to Mr Miliband this year. Mr Coates has built a £700 million fortune on the back of the firm, one of the world’s largest internet  sites for sports betting. Peter Coates (left) has donated £300,000 to the Labour party in the last decade and £10,000 to Ed Miliband this year. A third of his business profits come from a subsidiary based in Gibraltar . But company accounts filed in Gibraltar reveal more than a third of bet365’s profits come from its subsidiary based in the British overseas territory. Between 2009 and 2011 it paid a ten per cent rate of corporation tax in Gibraltar – compared with  28 per cent in the UK at the time – saving £13 million. Mr Miliband has described tax avoidance as ‘a terrible thing’. Labour’s policy review – which constitutes an early draft of the party’s next Election manifesto – included a paper that said: ‘Labour believes addressing tax avoidance at an individual and corporate level must  be a priority. ‘At home, this means making it plain to the Crown Dependencies [such as Gibraltar] we will expect them to observe the letter and the spirit of the law.’ It is not the first time  Mr Coates has seen his party links come under scrutiny. Between 20089 and 2011, bet365 paid a ten per cent rate of corporation tax in Gibraltar (pictured) compared with 28 per cent in the Uk, saving £13million . When Gordon Brown was Prime Minister, the gambling tycoon was accused of paying a £100,000 ‘thank you’ to Labour in the form of a donation after his firm benefited from the controversial decision to relax the betting laws. Last night, bet365 said it was unfair to highlight the tax advantages it enjoys because, unlike its main competitors,  it paid UK tax on the majority of its operations. A spokesman said: ‘Bet365 is the only major online bookmaker that remains licensed in the UK and as such pays more than £130 million in annual taxes to the UK Treasury.’ The company’s accounts show that in 2009-10 it saved £8 million by paying company taxes at the ten per cent then applicable in Gibraltar compared with the 28 per cent rate in the UK.  The following year it saved  a further £4.9 million by the arrangement.","Peter Coates has donated £300,000 to the Labour party in the past decade .

In comments that will alarm conservationists, Nick Boles said the amount of developed land may have to increase by up to a third to tackle the growing housing crisis. He told BBC Two’s Newsnight that ministers would protect the Green Belt - but warned that large areas of ‘open land’ may have to be given over for housing. And he hit out at developers for building ‘pig ugly’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting any new development. ‘We’re going to protect the Green Belt but if people want to have housing for their kids they have got to accept we need to build more on some open land,’ Mr Boles said: ‘In the UK and England at the moment we’ve got about nine per cent of land developed. All we need to do is build on another two to three per cent of land and we’ll have solved a housing problem.’ The UK land mass covers about 60 million acres. Using another three per cent for housing would mean concreting over 1.8 million acres of undeveloped land. Mr Boles’s figures suggest that tackling the housing shortage may mean building homes on every square inch of a county the size of Devon, which has 1.65 million acres. Ministers believe the public would be more willing to accept new housing if people realised how much of the countryside remained undeveloped. Sources at the Department for Communities and Local Government last night insisted that Mr Boles was ‘highlighting the scale of the problem’ rather than setting out a new Government strategy to concrete over the countryside. But Mr Boles said some urban areas were . more attractive than the countryside, adding: ‘The built environment can . be more beautiful than nature and we shouldn’t obsess about the fact . that the only landscapes that are beautiful are open - sometimes . buildings are better.’ Sacrificed: As much as two million acres of green fields could be bulldozed to make way for more housing . Mr Boles also declared war on the ‘pig ugly’ housing estates built by some developers in recent decades. He said it was vital that future developments were more attractive to make them more acceptable to the public. He will develop the theme further in a speech to planners tomorrow, telling them: ‘We are trapped in a vicious circle. ‘People look at the new housing estates that have been bolted on to their towns and villages in recent decades and observe that few of them are beautiful. Indeed, not to put too fine a point on it, many of them are pig-ugly. ‘Since new housing estates are all too often soulless and formulaic, and those who will inhabit them will add to the pressure on local roads, primary school places and doctor’s appointments, existing residents oppose any proposal to build new houses on green field sites, even when the land is of low environmental quality. ‘Local authorities respond to the wishes of local voters by putting too few sites into their local plans. And this drives the cost of development . land up to stratospheric levels.’ Mr Boles singles out the Harrisons . Wharf development in Purfleet, Essex, describing it as an ‘overbearing . and unbroken slab of dismal brickwork that is an insult to the community . it borders’. 'Pig ugly': The minister branded housing developments like Harrisons Wharf (pictured) as an insult to the community . He urges councils to bring forward much more land for housing development, but warns that that if they fail the controversial new ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’ introduced into the planning system this year would be used to ‘fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking.’ Mr Boles told Newsnight that the right to housing was ‘a basic moral right, like healthcare and education. There’s a right to a home with a little bit of ground around it to bring your family up in.’ He said he was determined to take on so-called Nimbys who oppose local development, saying: ‘It’s my job to make the arguments to these people that if they carry on writing letters their kids are never going to get a place with a garden to bring up their grand kids. 'I accept we haven’t been able to persuade them. I think it would be easier if we could persuade them that the new development would be beautiful.’ He urges councils to bring forward much more land for housing development, but warns that that if they fail the controversial new ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’ introduced into the planning system this year would be used to ‘fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking.’","Told Newsnight that large areas of 'open land' may have to go .

The newly-released calendar from the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium where a toddler was mauled to death earlier this month features pictures of the African painted dogs that killed him. Two-year-old Maddox Derkosh died after falling from a wooden railing into a pit of the dangerous predators on November 4. He bled to death after he was mauled by the animals, a medical examiner said. Zoo chiefs decided to send the 2013 calendars out because many had already been collected by supporters before Maddox died, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said. Scroll down for video . Beast: Pittsburgh Zoo has sent out calendars featuring the dogs that killed toddler Maddox Derkosh just weeks after the death . Victim: Maddox Derkosh, two, was killed after falling 11 feet into the dog pit at the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium. Deadly hunters: Zoo chiefs decided to release the calendars despite the tragic death . Zoo president Barbara Baker said scrapping the calendars, which were printed months ago, was considered. 'We wrestled with that one quite a bit,' she told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 'We had the calendars available before the accident occurred. 'African painted dogs are a wonderful endangered species,' and despite the tragedy, 'they are animals that we’re responsible for taking good care of.' She added that the thoughts and prayers of zoo staff was with the family. The calendar, titled The Color of Nature, features the dogs in March and has four photographs of them with accompanying text. Their exhibit remains closed. Officials said they would quarantine the animals for a month. Zoo president and CEO Barbara Baker said staff wrestled with the idea of releasing the calendar, but decided to go ahead as many copies had already made their way into the hands of zoo patrons . Scene: The overlook platform where the boy fell into the exhibit that was home to a pack of African painted dogs is seen through a window from another observation area at the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium . Where: This is the overlook platform where two-year-old Maddox fell into the dog enclosure. He bounced off the net, which is there to save small items like cameras and phones . Staff did not say whether the calendar would be sold at the gift shop, but the newspaper says there is a $14.95 price printed on the back cover. About 800 people attended Maddox’s funeral on November 9. “We . did discuss it, and we looked at it, but we decided to go forward with . it,” Baker said. “African painted dogs are a wonderful endangered . species,” and despite the tragedy, “they are animals that we’re . responsible for taking good care of.” “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and the child” Baker said. “We . did discuss it, and we looked at it, but we decided to go forward with . it,” Baker said. “African painted dogs are a wonderful endangered . species,” and despite the tragedy, “they are animals that we’re . responsible for taking good care of.” “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and the child” Baker said. Desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers . and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as . they savagely attacked the two-year-old. Baker said there is a net below the rail, . but the boy bounced off it and into the enclosure. She said the animals attacked the . child so quickly that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers . arrived seconds later, they determined it would have been futile to try . to rescue the child. Authorities said that zoo staff and . then police responded 'within minutes' but visitors described that time . as being filled with screams for help. Zookeepers called off some of the dogs, and seven of them immediately went to a back building. The African wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. The dog's Latin name Lycaon pictus means 'painted wolf' because of the animal's patchy colored coat of red, black, brown, white and yellow fur, each with their own unique pattern. These dogs are very social, and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members. In fact after a successful hunt, the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den. They hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests. They kill the larger prey by disemboweling, a technique . that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative, ferocious . reputation. They are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals. Its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - BFQ, the strength of bite relative to the animal's mass -  measured at 142, the highest of any carnivore, except for the Tasmanian devil. They are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent. There were once approximately 500,000 African wild dogs in 39 countries, and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon. Now there are only about 3,000-5,500 in fewer than 25 countries . Three more eventually were drawn away . from the child and one especially aggressive dog refused to back down and stop attacking . the boy. It was shot dead by an officer.  Experts said the death is highly unusual. It is the first death in the zoo's history. The dogs are currently in quarantine, but they will not be euthanised. Steve Feldman, a spokesman for the . Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said no one he's spoken to can recall . any deaths of children at an accredited zoo over the last 40 years or . more. Feldman said the Pittsburgh Zoo . successfully completed its five-year review in September, which means it . meets or exceeds all safety standards. The so-called painted dogs are about . as big as medium-sized domestic dogs, and 37 to 80 pounds, according to . the zoo. They have large, rounded ears and dark brown circles around . their eyes and are considered endangered. The attack happened in a 1.5 acre . exhibit called the Painted Dog Bush Camp that's part of a larger open . area where elephants, lions and other animals can be seen. Visitors walk . onto a deck that is glassed on the sides, but open in front where the . roughly four-foot railing is located. In May, some of the dogs crawled . under a fence and escaped into a part of the exhibit that's usually . closed. The zoo was on lockdown for about an hour as a precaution. Kraus said there was nothing to prevent visitors to the painted dog exhibit from jumping into the exhibit area. He described the accident as 'horrific'. 'Unfortunately, . the dogs were in pack mentality and not responding to zookeepers' efforts to control them,' the zoo said in a statement. Emergency: ThePittsburgh Zoo's entrance is seen after the young boy was killed after falling into the exhibit around noon . Lock-dock: The zoo immediately closed and patrons were hurried inside buildings during the attack . Deadly: The dogs, which are smaller than Labrador retrievers, can be dangerous on their own but are deadly killers when hunting in packs . Uncertainty: A security guard closes the gate to the park, which was temporarily closed immediately after the tragedy . In May, 200 patrons were rushed inside buildings and the zoo was put on lock-down when nine of the dogs sneaked out of the exhibit and found its way into a secondary holding pen. Alone, the dogs, which weigh up to 80 pounds, can be formidable, but in packs they are vicious -- capable of hunting and killing prey many times their size. They have been known to kill wildebeest and zebras, though they usually pursue less dangerous prey. The dogs, which are endangered, are among the most deadly predators of the Serengeti Plain. Their hunts end in a kill 80 per cent of the time. Lions have a success rate of just 30 per cent.","Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium released calendar with dogs despite tragedy .

Fraudster: Stacey Simpson, 25, told her three boyfriends she worked as an air hostess to cover up her cheating . A jobless conwoman pretended to be an air hostess, leading a globetrotting lifestyle so she could keep three lovers on the go at the same time. Stacey Simpson, 25, lived with her long-term partner while also sharing a ‘love-nest’ with another boyfriend, a court heard. And as police investigators closed in on her she went on a foreign holiday with a third man. She told her boyfriends she was employed by Emirates Airlines when she was actually unemployed and conning them and the council out of thousands of pounds. Her ruse meant she was able to deceive all three men, who were all living within miles of each other in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, into thinking she was jetting around the world when she was actually just down the road with one of her other partners. Simpson was jailed for 10 weeks at Kirklees Magistrates’ Court on Monday after pleading guilty to 12 fraud charges at a hearing earlier this month. One of her boyfriends - an unnamed fireman - ended up having two of his properties worth around £250,000 repossessed because she spent the money meant to pay the mortgages. She then rented out one of the flats to Qatari international student Abdullah Anthani even though it had already been repossessed. When Mr Abdullah returned from a holiday in February, 2011, he found the locks had been changed and he was unable to gain access to the repossessed flat. He met with Simpson six days later who convinced him to pay a further £1,000 pounds by telling him that she needed £700 for a month’s rent and £300 for mortgage arrears that didn’t exist. When he was still unable to get into the property he phoned her and she claimed to be in Singapore working in her role as an air hostess for the international airline Emirates. Home sweet home: Simpson claimed benefits for a house on Waverley Terrace, Huddersfield (pictured - with blue door), where she lived with one of her boyfriends . Numerous homes: Simpson rented out another boyfriend's flat in this building in Firth Street, Huddersfield, even though it had already been repossessed because she hadn't paid the mortgage . Deceit: All three men, who were all living All three men lived within miles of each other in Huddersfield, and would think she was jetting off for work when she was with another lover. Pictured, Firth Street . In March, Mr Abdullah contacted Kirklees Council and a joint investigation involving West Yorkshire Police and the Department for Work and Pensions was launched. Web of lies: She and the other boyfriend lived in his second property, the upstairs flat in St Johns Road, pictured, which was also repossessed . The court heard investigators discovered Simpson had submitted a housing benefit claim for another property she lived at with a different partner - dubbed Boyfriend Number Two. The next day she told council workers she was going away and flew to Majorca with Boyfriend Number Three. That same day the police turned up to the home in Huddersfield she had been sharing with Boyfriend Number One and her lies unravelled. In all, over a period spanning 14 months, she wrongly claimed £6,000 in a combination of housing benefit, job seekers allowance and council tax as well as £1,000 pounds from Mr Abdullah. In mitigation, Sonia Kidd, said Simpson’s actions had resulted in tensions within her family, specifically with her sister and father, Geoff Simpson. She said: 'She has no-one to support her. It is an incredibly difficult situation she has placed herself in.' Jailing Simpson for 10 weeks, the chairman of the bench, Margaret Atkinson, said: 'These were multiple offences of fraud. They were aggravated in that they were pre-meditated over a significant period of time.' A resident who knew serial seductress Stacey Simpson when she lived with her fireman boyfriend a couple of years ago described her as a 'Walter Mitty' character who lived in her own 'fantasy world'. The neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I'm not surprised at all to learn of this. She lived in her own little fantasy world, she was always coming out with these things and I wouldn't believe a word of it. 'When she first moved in she told me she sold stuff on eBay for a living. A few of her neighbours, including myself, gave her bits and pieces to sell for us. It took me a while of chasing her to get her to cough up the money.'

The neighbour continued: 'Stacey and her boyfriend were living here for about 18 months. 'Stacey would be away for periods of time and one time I asked her where she had been and she told me she had got a job as an air hostess and had been travelling the world. 'She was always telling me stories about where she had been, all round the world, but I didn't really believe it. She's a Walter Mitty-type character. 'As a person, she was very convincing and plausible, but you could tell there was something not quite right.'","Stacey Simpson, 25, told her boyfriends she worked for Emirates Airlines .

Meanwhile in Egypt's highest appeal . courts suspended their work today to protest presidential decrees that . gave the country's Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi nearly absolute . powers, state television reported, deepening the turmoil roiling the . country since the decrees were announced last week. A . widening dispute between the president and the nation's judiciary is at . the center of the uproar over a constitutional declaration placing . Morsi above oversight of any kind, including by the courts. Clashes: Riot police and protesters throw stones at one another during clashes near Tahrir Square today . Tension: Police fired tear gas into Cairo's Tahrir Square, where several hundred protesters spent the night after a mass rally to denounce President Mohamed Morsi's assumption of expanded powers . At least 200,000 protesters filled . Cairo's central Tahrir Square on Tuesday to denounce the decrees and . call on the president to rescind them.

A . ruling, regardless of which way it goes, would constitute a direct . challenge to Morsi, who took office in June as Egypt's first freely . elected president but has enraged pro-democracy activists who claim he . is acting too much like the authoritarian leader he replaced.

He faces 25 years to life in prison . An elementary school teacher who molested 13 students over a five-year period faces 25 years to life in prison. Paul Chapel III pleaded no contest to the charges yesterday just as his preliminary hearing was about to begin in San Fernando Superior Court in Los Angeles. The 51-year-old admitted 13 counts of lewd acts upon a child. Some of his victims were in court preparing to testify against their former teacher. Deputy . District Attorney Elena Abramson said Chapel will be sentenced to 25 . years in state prison when he returns to court on September 20. The . Telfair Elementary School teacher was initially charged last year with . molesting four children. Prosecutors added nine more children to the . case in May. The molestations occurred between September 2006 and April 2011 and involved children between the ages of eight and nine. Although . Chapel was charged with molesting four children last year, Los Angeles . Unified school officials waited until February to tell parents of his . third-grade students about his arrest. Even . then, they only did so because two teachers at nearby Miramonte . Elementary School were arrested on suspicion of molestation and . reporters investigated if any other teachers in the area had been . removed on similar grounds. Chapel was fired from his job in March. According to court documents seen by the Daily News Los Angeles, the district ignored repeated complaints about Chapel's conduct around children. Not . only that, but he had previously left a private school after allegedly . making inappropriate comments during a sex education class. Chapel taught at Telfair Elementary School (pictured) in the San Fernando Valley . And . he was tried but not convicted of another alleged molestation in 1997 . in which he was accused of abusing an eight-year-old neighbour and . friend of his son who was sleeping at his house. That case went to trial but Chapel wasn't convicted due to a lack of physical evidence - it was his word against the child's. But .

A coroner said she would have needed the speed of Usain Bolt to get across the road safely . A woman of 87 who died after being hit by a van on a busy dual carriageway would have needed the speed of Usain Bolt to get across the road safely, a coroner said yesterday. Pedestrians had just four seconds to cross four lanes, with no central refuge, before traffic lights turned from red to green. An inquest heard that widow Mary Woods would have taken an estimated 4.4 seconds just to get halfway across the A56 close to her home in Timperley, Greater Manchester. As a consequence, the Stockport hearing was told, the pensioner had little chance of making it across safely and was knocked down by a van turning right from a side street. She suffered multiple injuries and died two weeks later in hospital. Recording an accident verdict, coroner John Pollard said it was ‘ludicrous’ that pedestrians had such a short time to cross the road. Although there was no pedestrian crossing attached to the lights, lowered kerbs indicated that it was an area used by them to navigate the road, he said. Mr Pollard added that he would be writing to the local authority to demand new safety measures, saying even Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the fastest man on the planet, would have found it hard to get across the carriageway in time. ‘If a pedestrian is trying to cross safely they have four seconds, which if you are Usain Bolt is  difficult, and there is no refuge in the centre, no lane markings,’ said Mr Pollard. ‘It strikes me how ludicrous this is. The fact there is a lowered kerb indicates to pedestrians they can cross the road there. ‘It seems entirely unacceptable to expect an 87-year-old to get across. I will write to the chief executive of Trafford council to see if a pedestrian phase could be added to the lights. 'I know it is scant help to the family but it might help other pedestrians.’ Death: The junction of Woodcote Road and Manchester Road in Timperley, Greater Manchester, where Mary Woods was knocked down by a van whilst crossing the A56 . Wrong: Pedestrians had just four seconds to cross four lanes, with no central refuge, before traffic lights turned from red to green. An inquest heard that Mary Woods would have taken an estimated 4.4 seconds just to get halfway across the road . Driver Matthew Woolley told the inquest that he had not seen Mrs Woods when he turned on to the A56 from Woodcote Road in January last year. He said: ‘I set off when the lights turned green to turn right. I was in first gear. I saw an object in front of me and I slammed the brakes on.’ Mrs Woods, who lived alone, was taken to hospital but died a  fortnight later from broncho- pneumonia due to her injuries. Fast: The coroner said Mrs Woods would need the speed of Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, pictured, to get across the road safely . Police crash investigator PC Gary Bryon said that when the traffic lights went to red, Mrs Woods would have had just over four seconds to cross the road before traffic moved again. But he added: ‘It depends how mobile the individual is. We estimated it would take her 4.4 seconds just to walk to the centre of the road.’ In a statement Mrs Woods’ family said: ‘Mary was a kind aunt, and great aunt, who will be sadly missed.’","Mary Woods would have taken an estimated .

A chef who was convicted of murder after he admitted stuffing his wife's body in a pot and 'slow-cooking her' fired his attorney at a hearing today. David Viens, 49, was convicted of . second-degree murder in September following the death of his wife Dawn . in late 2009. He had confessed to accidentally killing her and then . cooking her body for four days in an effort to cover up his crime. Viens told his lawyer at an LA court on Tuesday that his services were no longer required and that he would represent himself at his February 1 sentencing. Viens faces 15 years to life in prison. On his own: Chef David Viens, pictured right, fired his lawyer Fred McCurry (left) in a Los Angeles court today as he awaits sentencing for the murder of his wife in 2009 . The murderer fired attorney Fred McCurry and was overheard saying 'thank you, Fred', according to the Los Angeles Times. The convicted killer, who had pleaded not guilty, tried to get rid of his attorney earlier in the trial but Judge Rand S. Rubin refused to allow the dismissal. Viens' decision should not change his sentencing but he could technically argue for the verdict to be dismissed despite this being an incredibly rare process. Dawn Viens' father and sister were in court on Tuesday and looked anguished at the development which gives the killer the option to file motions until January. David Viens appeared in court today in a wheelchair and wearing a back brace. He was critically injured when he leapt from a 80-ft cliff in March 2011 near Rancho Palos Verdes as police closed in on him for the crime. A juror said after the verdict in . September that it was that apparent suicide attempt which convinced him . of Viens' guilt, adding: 'My opinion was if he was innocent, he wouldn't . jump off a cliff.' During the trial, prosecutors . relied on gruesome interrogation tapes in which . Viens described how he shoved Dawn's body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling . water and cooked it until little but her skull was left. The chef said in the recordings that he mixed what remained of his . wife after she was boiled up with other waste and then dumped some of it . in a grease pit at his restaurant and put the rest in the trash. 'He treated her like a piece of meat': The couple's friend Karen Patterson told reporters justice had been done when Viens was convicted in September . He said he stashed his wife's skull in his mother's attic in Torrance, California. His defense attorney Fred . McCurry said the evidence didn't support a first-degree murder . conviction against his client, which requires proof of premeditation. A search of Viens' mother's house turned up nothing, nor did an excavation of his . restaurant Thyme Contemporary Cafe in Lomita, Los Angeles. On . the recording played in court, sheriff's Sgt. Richard Garcia asked . Viens what happened on October 18, 2009, the night his wife disappeared. 'For some reason I just got violent,' said Viens.

This booking photo provided by the Benton County Sheriff's office shows Zachary Holly after his arrest . Holly is being held in the Benton County Jail on capital murder, kidnapping and residential burglary charges. He is due to appear in court today. Jersey, whose father and stepmother are in prison for chaining the little girl to a dresser last year, was found dead just minutes after she was reported missing from her bedroom on the morning of November 20. Julie Pickard, who lives on the other side of the home where the six-year-old's body was found, said that Holly wept before authorities removed Jersey's remains. 'He was crying for a long time,' she told The Associated Press. She said police knocked on her door later that day and asked her to let them know if she saw a man wearing Mountain Dew pyjama pants. '[Holly] was wearing Mountain Dew pyjama pants,' Ms Pickard said. Bentonville Police are yet to release details of how the little girl died or what led officers to arrest Holly, who worked at local restaurant The Flying Burrito Company. Arrested for murder: Zachary Dewayne Holly with his wife Amanda Jo Holly . Newly weds: Zachary Dewayne Holly and Amanda Jo Holly were married in March, according to their Facebook pages . There was no answer yesterday at the mobile home where police say . Holly lived with his wife. A child's bicycle rested on a patch of grass . near the home in the city. Bentonville Police chief Jon Simpson said the couple didn't have any children . but that Holly's wife has a child who is 'pretty much the same age as . our victim'. Simpson described Holly as 'an acquaintance' and a friend . of Jersey's family. Jersey's death comes after her father and stepmother chained the girl to . a dresser last year. David Bridgeman told investigators he restrained . his daughter to prevent her from getting into medication and other . things around the house in nearby Rogers. David Bridgeman and Jersey's stepmother, Jana Bridgeman, pleaded guilty . in June to false imprisonment, permitting abuse of a minor and . endangering the welfare of a minor. She is serving a 12-year prison . sentence, plus three years for a probation revocation. He is serving an . 18-year prison sentence. Simpson said many questions about the investigation would be answered when a probable cause affidavit is released today. In the meantime, those who knew Jersey are remembering the little girl . who was still joyful despite what was, by all indications, a difficult . life. 'I don't know how she dealt with it, but she dealt with it and she still . smiled the whole time,' family friend Mike Whitcomb said. Tragic: Jersey Bridgeman recently celebrated her sixth birthday . Simpson . said Holly would have a bail and probable cause hearing Wednesday, . during which a probable cause affidavit will be released. He said the . girl's family had been notified about the arrest. Holly lives next door to the six-year-old victim, in between her house and the vacant house where her body was found. Holly, 28, states on his Facebook page that he lives with his wife Amanda Jo Holly and her four-year-old son and that he graduated from Huntsville High School in Texas in 2004. Amanda Jo Holly is Facebook friends with Jersey’s biological mother, DesaRae Bridgeman. Bridgeman . said she last saw her daughter around midnight, before reporting her . missing around 6.30am. Authorities found her body approximately 10 . minutes later. After . Jersey's body was found, investigators searched the home where she . lived and the house where her body was found, as well as the homes in . between. The FBI was . brought in to assist in the investigation. Meanwhile, it is still unclear where DesaRae Bridgeman was at the time of the missing persons call. Bentonville . police have said that certain details of the case were being . withheld 'to maintain the integrity of the investigation'. After the arrest of her father and stepmother, Jersey was put under the care of her biological mother. According to police reports, she died between midnight and 6.43 am, when police received the call that the girl had gone missing. Police said the six-year-old had been living with a 'relative' when she went missing. Questions: Holly is due to appear in court today in Arkansas, U.S. Jersey made headlines last year when her father and stepmother chained her to a dresser as part of a punishment. In conversations with childcare specialists, the six-year-old said that she slept on the floor of her parents' room and that she was tied up for misbehaving. Behind Bars: Jersey's father was sentenced to 18 years in prison for having chained the girl to a dresser as punishment . 'She said that Jana and David chain her to the dresser because she had gotten up and eaten some pies, cereal, and bread,' Rogers Police Detective Larry Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. He added that the girl 'stated that they put a belt around her waist so that she could not get up and get any food.' The woman who first contacted the police . about possible child endangerment said she saw Jersey tied up to the dresser with a . silver chain, which appeared to be a dog collar. Jersey's father David admitted in court that he did tie up his daughter with a belt but defended his actions by saying that this was to prevent her from getting into medication and other dangerous materials around the house. 'He said that he thinks she may be sleepwalking and that they discussed buying a child gate, but since he does not have a job, they could not afford to buy one at that time,' Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. The father added that he had first cut a belt to fit around his daughter's ankle and added a lock on it after she had broken free. Then after she complained about the pain in her leg, he chained her by the waist instead. 'It should be noted that the chain that David used was approximately one to two feet in length and appeared to be a dog choke collar,' Taylor added. Both Bridgeman's father and stepmother pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, permitting abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor. For their crime, the father is serving an 18-year prison sentence, while the stepmother was sentenced to 12 years. Tragic: Jersey pictured with her biological mother DesaRae Bridgeman.

For many children the daily trudge to school is bad enough, but spare a thought for these youngsters and their parents as they make their way to lessons. Pupils at the newly-opened £4million Chaddesley Corbett primary school in Worcestershire have to wade their way through a mud-bath because no pedestrian footpath was built. Comparing it to the scene at the end of a rainy festival, parents have reacted angrily to the lack of a proper access route to the school. The primary only opened on Monday and following heavy rain the track to the school has churned up making children filthy before they arrive and parents with buggies barely able to get there. Isabelle Foreman, three, looks down at her muddy shoes as she is walked down the path by her mother, Kate . 'Mudbath': Mother-of-two Kate Foreman, 31, Isabelle, 3 and Poppy 11 weeks, make their way along a muddy path leading to the brand new Chaddesley Corbett Endowed Primary School which opened on Monday . New: The £4million school only opened its doors this week, but already parents have hit out at the lack of pedestrian access for pupils and their parents . Mother-of-two Kate Foreman, 31, said that taking her three-year-old daughter Isabelle to school for her first day today would be a nightmare. She said: 'It's a mudbath, it's like the end of a music festival. 'There are people without cars who have to walk to school and they won't be able to get there. You need wellies and waterproofs it's so bad. 'You've got no chance if you've got a pushchair as well - the wheels would get stuck. 'It's a complete oversight. They spent all that money on the school but didn't think how people could get there.' Tough terrain: Mother Kate Foreman, pictured, says that her and three-year-old daughter Isabelle will have to don wellies and waterproofs to get to school . The new school has been built with larger classrooms, a hall and forest school areas and dedicated food technology, music and science facilities. The move has seen two existing schools - Chaddesley Corbett Endowed First School and the nearby Stone First School - merge to form a single primary. Plans for the school were criticised when approved in October last year by the local highways authority and local ramblers who said that excessive car parking provision would encourage a dependence upon cars to get pupils to school. Councillor Stephen Clee said that Worcestershire County Council are looking for a short-term solution to the problem. He said: 'We fully appreciate the concerns of parents about the current condition of the path that leads to the school and I have been working with officers in our countryside service, the parish council and the landowner to provide a short term improvement to the path that will help parents and children get to and from the new school safely.' Worcestershire County Council described pedestrian access to the school as being along a ‘rural footpath’. Chaddesley Corbett is an 'Aided School' meaning that it is owned by Trustees rather than the county council. The Trustees acquired the land for the new school and subsequently the local authority supported the trustees through their planning application and gave some funding for the new build. The council said that a condition of the planning permission submitted by the Trustees of the school to Wyre Forest District Council (the planning authority) was to provide improvements to the footpath accessing the rear of the school and this work should have been completed by the applicant. Worcestershire County Council said a landowner, understood to be a garden nursery adjacent to the site, has now pledged to carry out improvements to the path. 'Like the end of a festival': The path, running alongside neighbouring nursuries, is the only pedestrian access to the new school site .

Sally Bercow could be landed with a £5,000 fine for contempt of court after she named a teenager who allegedly ran away with a teacher . Sally Bercow has blundered on Twitter again by naming a runaway schoolgirl whose identity was protected by a court order. The Speaker’s wife could face a £5,000 fine for contempt of court after breaching the order which bans the naming of the girl who allegedly ran away with her teacher to France this year. Mrs Bercow’s gaffe comes just a fortnight after she used Twitter to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine following a BBC2 Newsnight report which alleged a senior Conservative figure from the Thatcher era was a child abuser. He was not named on the programme but was identified quickly online. It later emerged that he was the victim of mistaken identity. Lord McAlpine, who settled with the BBC for £185,000, is now suing Mrs Bercow, although she insists that what she said on Twitter was ‘mischievous’ rather than ‘libellous’. Her latest blunder happened on Sunday, when she named the teenage girl on Twitter. This tweet has since been deleted. She then wrote another message to her 59,000 followers, saying she had been discussing the matter with a friend. She had been referring to the case of Jeremy Forrest, a 30-year-old teacher in Eastbourne, East Sussex, who was arrested in Bordeaux in September and returned to Britain. He was charged with abducting a child and remanded in custody at a court hearing last week. The court made a Section 39 Order under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, banning the naming of the teenager. The order states: ‘Any publication by whatever media in breach of this order is punishable by a fine in the sum of £5,000.’ Reference: The Labour activist was referring to the case of Jeremy Forrest, a teacher in Eastbourne, who was arrested in Bordeaux in September. He is pictured in October getting on a plane to return to Britain . Legal action: Her gaffe comes just a fortnight after she used Twitter to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine, following a Newsnight report which alleged a senior Tory figure was a child abuser . Legal experts say using a social networking site such as Twitter to comment does constitute publication, meaning Mrs Bercow, a Labour activist, could face a fine. Sarah Webb, a media lawyer with the firm Payne Hicks Beach, said: ‘The contempt of court requirements will apply to her just the same as any newspaper or broadcaster. I would advise her to be very cautious. ‘I  would certainly urge her to turn off her Twitter account at the moment. Angry: Sally Bercow was sent a letter from solicitors acting for Lord McAlpine (pictured in April 1998) ‘She may not know the law, but equally most people who have an understanding of these things know that in respect of actions involving children and things like that, you can’t go around naming them. I think it is surprising that none of these things seem to cross her radar. 'The contempt of court requirements will apply to her just the same as any newspaper or broadcaster. I would advise her to be very cautious. I would certainly urge her to turn off her Twitter account at the moment' Sarah Webb, media lawyer . Mrs Bercow’s agent was  contacted last night but did  not reply. Last Thursday, Mrs Bercow received a . letter from solicitors acting for Lord McAlpine, who are examining 1,000 . tweets  that they believe defame the 70-year-old peer. It said legal action will be  taken . against for her remarks on Twitter which allegedly linked him with child . abuse. She had tweeted: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent . face*’. Over the weekend, Mrs Bercow  used . Twitter to argue that she was being unfairly targeted  by Lord McAlpine . because she was high profile and a Labour supporter. ‘This is totally politically motivated, I tell you,’ she wrote. ‘And I don’t do conspiracy theories as a rule.’ In another tweet, she declared: ‘I don’t have money to contest a multi-millionaire.

An obsessed admirer who was jailed for stalking a beauty queen is behind bars again for breaching his restraining order. Anthony Mantova, 34, was handed an 18-week custodial sentence in July after pleading guilty to harassing Chloe Hopkins. He had tattooed Ms Hopkins' name across his chest and wore a T-shirt with her photograph on it. 'Nightmare': Former Miss Prestatyn, Chloe Hopkins, pictured left, has been stalked by obsessed Anthony Mantova, 34, pictured right, for two years after they met on a night out . But upon his release from prison he broke an indefinite restraining order, preventing him from contacting former Miss Prestatyn 2010 Chloe Hopkins, creating communication about her, and entering the street where she lives. He was jailed again for 28 days at Prestatyn Magistrates Court on November 14th for harassment of Ms Hopkins and breaching his restraining order. Ms Hopkins, 20, known as Prestatyn’s Pop Princess, said: 'He had breached his bail conditions. 'It is awful this has started again. I just want it to stop. I don’t know what I have done wrong. 'He’s been upsetting a lot of my friends.' Miss Hopkins has welcomed new laws to help the victims of stalkers but called for longer sentences . Mantova was also ordered to serve 14 days in prison for breaching the restraining order while on licence from prison for his last offence. His total sentence amounted to 42 days and he will be released from prison in December. While Ms Hopkins has welcome new laws to help victims of stalkers she believes tougher sentences are needed. Two specific criminal offences of stalking have come into force in England and Wales for the first time designed to provide extra protection for victims, highlight the serious impact stalking can have on their lives and help bring more perpetrators to justice. She said: 'It has been a long time coming. But the sentences should be longer, I think they could have gone further.' The beauty queen suffered a two-year nightmare when she was being stalked by Mantova and she tried to take her own life as the abuse sent her into a spiral of depression and isolation. The former Prestatyn High School pupil first met Mantova while on a night out in Prestatyn with friends in August 2010 when they approached him after feeling sorry for him. He then added Chloe on social networking site Facebook and started attending her appearances after she was crowned Miss Prestatyn taking pictures during events. He also had a T-shirt printed with her picture, set up online petitions against her and left suggestive comments on Facebook, which Ms Hopkins became upset might be seen by some of her young fans and had her name and the name of three friends tattooed on his chest. Ms Hopkins said she could not have got through the last two years without the support of her family, friends, fans and supporters in the local community. She said: 'A lot of people have been coming up to me and telling me things that Anthony Mantova has done to them. If anyone has any information about what he has done to them they need to come forward and tell the police.'","Anthony Mantova, 34, was jailed for 18 weeks in July for harassing 'Prestatyn’s Pop Princess' Chloe Hopkins .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 04:52 EST, 28 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:53 EST, 28 November 2012 . More than 100,000 children aged between six and 11 have visited pro-anorexia websites that encourage people to compete against eachother in deadly starvation games, a study has found. There are at least 500 of these 'gruesome' sites, which encourage vulnerable young women to barely eat and just drink coffee, smoke and take diet pills to look like a 'goddess'. Using the phrase 'starving for perfection' they say users should eat no more than 500 calories a day - the recommended level is 2,000 for women and 2,500 for men. Scandal: Hundreds of sites like this one exist - the post cannot be shown and is one of many showing how people can use techniques to become dangerously thin . Message: Negative imagery painted with words like these are looked at by 500,000 people per year, a study has found . They also include 'thinspiration' sections with images of super-slim women, including Fearne Cotton, Katy Holmes and Sarah Harding, and in the last year 500,000 girls have admitted visiting them, and one in five were aged between six and 11. University Campus Suffolk in Ipswich has carried out research into the issue and found than many of these websites are set up by people with anorexia and other eating disorders. 'It starts with an individual who wants to share their experience and as they get a following they set themselves up as almost Goddess-like,' researcher Dr Emma Bond, senior lecturer in childhood and youth studies said. 'When I started this research last January I came across a website set up by a girl who was disgusted with herself because she had put on a few pounds at Christmas. She planned to fast for three days and regain control. Pictures: Images like these (Fearne Cotton left and Sarah Harding's torso right) are used as 'thinspiration' for people using these pro-anorexic sites . 'In under two hours, she had 36 followers saying things like ""You’re wonderful, you’re an inspiration to me, I’m only fasting because of you"".' Some of the people are even posting pictures of themselves in very few clothes on thousands of blogs and on social media like Twitter. Official figures show that one in 200 women and one in 2,000 men have anorexia – which means they starve themselves or exercise excessively to stay slim – although some experts believe the true number is much higher. Around eight per cent of women and one per cent of men develop bulimia at some point. They binge on excessive amounts of food then make themselves sick or use laxatives to stop gaining weight. Many sufferers of eating disorders hide their problem from family and friends by pretending they have already eaten to avoid meals and wearing baggy clothes to conceal their skeletal shape. Doctors believe that anorexia or bulimia is more common in people who are perfectionists, tend to worry a lot or are often depressed. Dangerous: The internet is awash with these very basic sites and they are designed to make people with eating disorders feel part of a group and compete against eachother . Although experts blame society’s ‘size zero’ obsession for the recent surge in cases, it can be triggered by stressful events such as a death in the family, bullying at school or parents getting divorced. Dr Bond said: 'Girls are posting images of themselves and are then approached by people who want to sell them on porn sites because there is a market for ""skinny porn"".  But the girls are  unaware they are being looked at for sexual gratification. 'To a vulnerable teenager they appear lovely, pretty and attractive and give a sense of belonging. But they have a gruesome side too.' Her study is called: 'Virtually Anorexic – Where’s the harm?' and was backed by the Nominet Trust and charity b-eat.","More than 500,000 - mainly teenage girls -  are visiting these sites every year .

Early in the morning, just as day is dawning, he picks up all the postbags in his van... but now, the postman is banned from delivering to one particular housing estate due to fears he might trip over. Overzealous Royal Mail health and safety officers have ruled that the uneven paving slabs on two roads in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, are too dangerous for their postmen to negotiate. If they want to get their mail, residents of Maryfield Walk and Rogerstone Avenue will be forced to make a six-mile round trip in order to collect their letters, parcels and postcards from the nearest depot and carry them home themselves. A bump in the road: Royal Mail refuse to deliver letters to some houses in Stoke-on-Trent because of the health and safety risk posed by uneven paving slabs like these . 'Madness': This pathway is considered by officials to be too treacherous for a postman to traverse . Do it yourself: Pensioners will be forced - along with other residents - to make a six-mile round trip to get their mail rather than make postmen face walking over these wobbly stones . And the situation won't change unless families living on the road pay out to repair the wonky stones that have been deemed so hazardous. Residents are furious at the decision, and have called the move - which has come at one of the busiest times of year for post - 'madness'. Student Lodfi Liberal, 19, who lives on Maryfield Walk, said: 'It feels like Royal Mail are persecuting the people who live here. 'It's not our fault the paths are a little uneven in places but that's life. 'We all cope with the paths, we're not kept prisoners in our homes too scared to venture out in case we trip over so why should Royal Mail be so worried? 'It's just madness.' Another resident, Dave Poole, 49, went further, describing it as just one more example of 'health and safety gone mad.' He said: 'We have elderly residents who manage the . stones fine, so why can’t these fit and healthy posties do the same? It’s not like anyone has injured themselves. 'It’s outrageous. How can OAPs be expected to travel six miles every day just to pick up their letters?' Elderly local Jean Rodger, 83, agreed. 'I’m expecting letters from the hospital . so I’ve had to ask a lady around the corner to pick up my post for me. I’ve been here 26 years. 'If I can manage the flagstones, I’m sure the postman can.' Quite a distance: The lengthy route from Maryfield Walk to the Leek Road Post Office depot that residents will now have to take . Frustrating: A copy of the letters the postman did deliver - telling residents their service would be ending. Right, Student Lodfi Liberal, who feels the Royal Mail is 'persecuting' the people of the area . Residents have found themselves at a stand-off with Royal Mail over how to deal with the damaged pavements. Many people living in the area are short-term renters such as students and nurses rather than homeowners, and are unwilling or unable to pay for the work out of their own pockets. This has left many of those affected with the task of tracking down landlords to try and persuade them to invest in the repairs. Dave Oldfield, 69, who has lived at his . property for 28 years, said: 'Nothing has been done to the paving slabs . because some of the property owners rent their houses so it is difficult . to find out who they are. 'It will be down to a few people who live here and own their properties to do something and it will be too expensive. But Mr Oldfield has come up with one initiative to tackle the problem - erecting his own postbox on another street. Stand-off: Many people living in the area are short-term renters such as students and nurses rather than homeowners, and unwilling to pay for repairs out of their own pockets . He said: 'I have put a postbox on the other side . of my house away from the slabs and asked a manager if they can put any . post in there and I am waiting for an answer.' A spokesman for Royal Mail said: 'We have temporarily suspended deliveries because of the very poor state of the pavements in the area. 'We . previously raised our concerns with residents about the safety risk . because the pavements are their responsibility, but to date these . haven’t been addressed. 'We carried out a further risk assessment last week and the paving clearly posed a safety risk. 'Our . delivery staff have been injured in very similar circumstances and as . we have a duty of care we are not prepared to compromise on safety. 'We are keen to resume deliveries to these addresses as soon as improvements are made to the pavements.' The affected residents have been advised to check their property deeds or consult the Land Registry. Pete Price, of Stoke-on-Trent City Council, said: 'It is the responsibility of the landowner to ensure the roads and pavements are maintained to a safe standard.' Poor service: Dozens of families and elderly people living on Maryfield Walk and Rogerstone Avenue will now go without any postal deliveries until they pay for the repairs . Taking initiative: Locals have attempted to work around the post ban by offering postmen alternative places to leave letters, or in the case of resident Dave Oldfield, erecting their own postboxes on neighbouring streets .","Royal Mail insists homeowners must pay to repair the cracked slabs out of their own pockets .

TV star Justin Lee Collins subjected his girlfriend to a humiliating nine-month campaign of verbal and physical abuse, a court heard yesterday. Among a series of bizarre demands, the comedian allegedly forced Anna Larke to help him compile a detailed dossier of her former lovers. He also made her sleep facing him in bed and ordered her to throw away DVDs featuring actors she was attracted to, it was claimed. Justin Lee Collins as he arrives today at St Alban's Crown Court where he faces charges of harassment against his former partner . On top of this, it was alleged that . Collins told Miss Larke to close down her Facebook account, stop using . Twitter and abandon her email address. The court was told he even banned her . from looking at other men, saying: ‘When you’re with me you look at the . ****ing ground, you look at a tree ... you don’t look at any other . ****ing human being.’ Anna Larke, Collins' alleged harassment victim . Miss Larke also alleged Collins, who . appeared in the West End musical Rock of Ages, has a problem with . ‘people of colour’ accusing her of sleeping with men from ethnic . minorities. The father of two is accused of . assaulting and harassing Miss Larke, 38, after he moved in with her in . January last year following the breakdown of his marriage. He denies a . charge of harassment by causing Miss Larke fear of violence between . January and August last year. St Albans Crown Court heard Collins, . who found fame with Channel 4’s The Friday Night Project, initially . showered Miss Larke with ‘beautiful gifts and lovely dinners’ and even . put £1,000 into her bank account. Former PR worker Miss Larke said: ‘It seemed like no big deal between being with the love of my life and being on Facebook.’ But she claimed Collins, 38, soon . began a campaign of verbal and physical abuse against her saying she was . a ‘sex addict’ who was ‘riddled with’ sexually transmitted diseases. The jury of nine women and three men . was told Collins compiled a dossier of Miss Larke’s previous sexual . encounters in a notebook. Peter Shaw, QC, prosecuting said: ‘She . felt it was a disgusting thing to have to do and she was worried that . she would lose him by doing it. But he told her it would help the . relationship and help him deal with her past. ‘When Mr Collins was satisfied that . Miss Larke had provided a sufficient amount of information he signified . his satisfaction with the word: “Done”.’ Speaking about the notebook Miss Larke . told the court he had wanted a full account of her previous sexual . activity. Collins pictured in 2011 with his former girlfriend Anna Larke after he split from his wife . She thought it was ‘weird’ but went along with it because she . ‘worshipped the ground he walked on’ and didn’t want to lose him. Miss Larke said Collins demanded to know who she was speaking to on her phone or who she was texting. ‘He knew everything about me,’ she said. ‘It was the ultimate power really.’ The court heard how Collins had first . met Miss Larke in 2006 when he was the presenter of the Golden Joysticks . video game awards and she was a public relations worker. They had an ‘intimate’ relationship . that was ended by Collins when he was exposed by the News of the World . in 2008 for cheating on his wife with a woman other than Miss Larke. Collins is the former host of the Friday Night Project. The court heard he 'insisted' that his girlfriend 'sleep facing towards him' The prosecution claimed Collins . contacted Miss Larke again in November 2010 via Facebook and he left his . wife shortly afterwards  and moved from Bristol to Kew in South-West . London. She said that he claimed to be unhappy in his  marriage and told . her he had had ‘six one-night stands’. After Miss Larke moved in with Collins . he allegedly began to try to control her – even insisting she throw out . DVDs featuring actors she might be attracted to. She told the court she . had been forced to dump a box set of the series Smallville because she . had once fancied the actor who played Superman. Miss Larke, a recovering alcoholic, . also said she was sleep deprived because Collins insisted she always lay . in bed facing him. She said he would wake her and criticise her if he . woke and found she had turned away from him. Jurors heard the comedian, pictured at an earlier court appearance, assaulted and harassed his former partner during their nine-month relationship . She added: ‘He would make me stay . awake until he went to bed. This was sometimes four or five in the . morning. He used to say if I fell asleep before him I was running the . risk of him texting other women.’ The court was told Collins would . physically assault Miss Larke by slapping her, grabbing her arms, . pulling her hair and spitting on her face. In a videoed police interview played to the court she said: ‘Anything would trigger it, there was such a temper on him.’ She said when he hit her in the face ‘my whole jaw and teeth were killing me and I would get bruises’. St Albans Crown Court where the court heard Collins made his former girlfriend recount every sexual experience she had ever had for a notebook he kept as part of a campaign of domestic abuse . In July 2011 Miss Larke said they had gone to a pub and she had suggested Collins cuddled her like a couple who were nearby. This allegedly caused Collins to fly . into a rage and when they returned home Miss Larke recorded his tirades . on a mobile phone.

A nanny accused of brutally stabbing two children to death in the bathtub of their luxurious Manhattan home has pleaded not guilty to the murders. Yoselyn Ortega, 50, made her plea on Wednesday from her bed in New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center, where she has been under police guard since the killings. She continues to undergo treatment after she allegedly stabbed herself following the murders of Lucia Krim, six, and her brother, Leo, two, in their Upper West . Side apartment on October 25. Their mother, Marina Krim, arrived home with her other daughter, three-year-old Nessie, to find her children in a pool of blood in the bathtub. She then reportedly witnessed the nanny stab herself. Plea: Jocelyn Ortega, pictured centre, has pleaded not guilty to killing six-year-old Lucia Krim (right) and her two-year-old brother Leo while they were in her care at their Manhattan home . Removal men have packed up boxes of . the Krims' belongings and sources have suggested the family will not . return to the apartment where Lucia and Leo were . killed. Ortega, Lucia and Leo had been due to meet Mrs Krim and Nessie at a dance studio, but the mother became concerned when they failed to turn up and returned to the home. After learning from the doorman that the . nanny had not left the building, Mrs Krim frantically searched the . apartment and came across the grisly scene in the bathroom. Ortega's suicide bid failed and she was . put in a medically-induced coma. She has now been brought out of this . and charged with murder. Loss: Lulu and Leo, pictured, each had multiple stab wounds and were pronounced dead in hospital . Happier times: Marina and Kevin Krim, pictured at a 2009 event at Tavern on the Green in Central Park . When . questioned by police after awaking from the coma, the nanny attempted . to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the . tragedy on her. Ortega, who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to . do and asked her to do the housework. 'She said . something like, ""I'm paid to watch the children, not clean up and do . housework"",' a law-enforcement source said of Ortega’s statements to . police after she woke from the coma. Yoselyn became extremely animated . when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she . had numerous disagreements with mother . Marina about how the kids were being cared for. Ortega waived her right to have a lawyer . present during questioning when she ominously told the detective, ''Marina knows what happened'', a source told the New York Times. Father: Kevin Krim recounted the magical childhood of his two . lost children at their memorial service . Family: Lulu is pictured with her father Kevin Krim and mother Marina Krim, who found her children stabbed in the bathtub and their nanny with a slit throat and wrists on the bathroom floor . Reports claimed Marina didn't think . Yoselyn was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk . food. The Krims were also reportedly worried . about Ortega's job performance in the weeks leading up to the killings . and had told her that if she didn't improve, they might need to replace . her. But the Krims' extended family dispute . they treated her poorly, explaining that they paid for her to travel on . holidays and even visited her family in the Dominican Republic. In a brief interview this week, Karen . Krim, the slain children's paternal grandmother, said that they . continue to grapple with the horrific crime. 'Under the circumstances, we are all doing as well as can be expected,' she said. Missed: Lucia and Leo are pictured on their mother's blog, where she wrote about days out with her children . Scene: The murders occurred at La Rochelle, a luxury prewar building on Manhattan's Upper West Side . Discovery: Crime scene unit officials enter the luxury apartment building where the stabbings took place . The family paid tribute to the murdered youngsters at Manhattan's Avery Hall following the deaths. Breaking down in tears, Kevin .

A state-owned newspaper accused the veteran British singer of being ‘disrespectful’ and said his actions could lead to a ban on other Western performers putting on shows in China. The attack from China came after a concert by the 65-year-old at the weekend which he dedicated to Ai Weiwei, the man behind the famous Beijing Olympic Stadium. 'Super like': Elton John posed for a photo with Ai Weiwei which the latter then posted on his Twitter account, much to the dismay of China's communist regime . At the end of the show, Sir Elton stunned his audience when he said he was dedicating the show to Weiwei. He said he was there to give tribute to Weiwei’s ‘honour and talent’. The pair even met ahead of the concert and the Chinese artist then posted a picture on Twitter claiming ‘I super like him [Elton John]’. The Global Times, a paper run by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily, said in an editorial: ‘John’s unexpected action was disrespectful to the audience and the contract that he signed with the Chinese side, . ‘He forcibly added political content to the concert, which should have been nothing more than an entertaining performance.’ The prominent sculptor, 55, is a noted critic of the communist regime. Ai support you: Elton John on stage in Beijing as he dedicated his performance to Ai Weiwei . Last year, he disappeared into police custody for 81 days, drawing worldwide headlines and casting a spotlight on the government’s growing concern over social unrest following the uprisings of the Arab Spring. Post-release he was convicted of tax evasion, around £1million, by the Beijing tax bureau and barred from leaving the country for one year. ‘John’s action will also make the relevant agencies further hesitate in the future when they invite foreign artists,’ said the Global Times. ‘John himself is a senior entertainment figure, but has raised difficulties for future arts exchanges between China and other countries.’ The iconic Grammy Award-winning artist is scheduled to return to China next week to play at a concert in the southern city of Guangzhou, following shows in South Korea, Malaysia and Hong Kong. John performs in Hong Kong on December 4. They Ai-nt happy: Beijing accused the British music legend of being 'disrespectful' in an editorial published in a state-owned paper . Tickets for the performance remained on sale on Wednesday and the promoter said cultural authorities had not informed them of any cancellation. But the Global Times suggested that 'Chinese audiences need not hesitate to protest the provocateur and boo him off the stage'. Ai said he welcomed the editorial because it was a rare instance of state-run media mentioning his name and reporting on controversial issues that are routinely censored. 'I’m quite happy they did this, at least they are starting to talk about the things that a lot of people think about,' Ai said. 'They realise that they need to have their own voice and that they can’t remain silent all the time” on controversial issues censored by the authorities. Other Western artists have also courted controversy while touring China. In 2008 Icelandic singer Bjork shouted ‘Tibet, Tibet’ at the end of a concert in Shanghai.","Dedicated Beijing concert to controversial artist this weekend .

But these days it helps if you have a computer too. Online dating is becoming one of the most popular ways to find a partner. More than nine million Britons are thought to have logged on looking for a perfect match. They are contributing to a business that last year generated £170million for the UK economy. Popular: About nine million Britons are believed to have logged on to internet dating sites such as eHarmony . That’s the highest turnover of any European nation last year, ahead of Germany with £164million and France with £99million. Such is the demand here that Britain has produced 1,500 of Europe’s 5,000 dating websites. We also offer the most ‘diverse’ range, from ‘cougar dating’ for men seeking older women, to ‘uniform dating’, in which users look for partners in the Armed Forces. While two-thirds of Britons use . mainstream dating sites such as Match and eHarmony, another 2.8 million . sought out ‘erotic encounters’ on websites such as Sexintheuk. The figures, which come from Metaflake, a company that reviews online dating agencies and runs leadingdatingwebsites.co.uk, also show the UK market jumped 6 per cent last year. The company estimates that a third of new . relationships now arise from the internet. But it warned that a quarter . of those surfing the web for a partner, particularly men, were already . in a relationship. Chief executive Henning Wiechers said: ‘In the UK there is a longer tradition of using online dating and people are willing to spend more.’ Robert Bailey of leadingdatingwebsites.co.uk added: ‘The British are just so enlightened and open minded and that’s why so many people try online dating.’ Psychologists from the University of Rochester in the U.S. warned earlier this year that dating websites were making people more judgmental. Professor Harry Reis said that skimming over hundreds of potential mates can promote a ‘shopping’ mentality, resulting in single people becoming excessively picky. Singletons who spent weeks or months emailing a potential mate before meeting them often had unrealistic expectations when they finally went on a date, he said.","Country has highest internet dating turnover of any European nation .

A hearing aid powered by the body itself could soon be developed after researchers found a way to power electronic devices using the ear's own natural battery. Deep inside the inner ear of mammals there is a natural battery - a chamber filled with ions that produces electricity to drive neural signals. Researchers from MIT and the Harvard Medical school have now been demonstrated for the first time that this battery could be used to power implantable electronic devices. Minuscule: A close-up picture of the tiny device incorporating a radio transmitter and power supply that was implanted into the ears of guinea pigs as part of the study . Initially the devices are intended to monitor biological activity inside the ears of people with hearing or balance problems, but one day they could be used to deliver therapies themselves. Researchers implanted electrodes into the biological batteries in the ears of guinea pigs and connected them to low-power electronic devices. After the devices were implanted, the guinea pigs responded normally to hearing tests and the devices were able to transmit data about chemical conditions within the ear to an external receiver. Konstantina Stankovic, an ontologic . surgeon who took part in the research, said: 'In the past, people have . thought that the space where the high potential is located is . inaccessible for implantable devices, because potentially it’s very . dangerous if you encroach on it. Ingenious: The device was powered by electrodes plugged into a natural battery which sits inside the cochlea of all mammals . 'We have known for 60 years that this battery exists and that it’s really important for normal hearing, but nobody has attempted to use this battery to power useful electronics.' Like a record player the ear converts a mechanical force - in this case the vibrations of the eardrum - into an electrical signal, which the brain is able to recognise. The biological battery that is the source of that signal's current is located in the cochlea. It has a chamber divided by a membrane, some of whose cells are specialised to pump ions. An imbalance of potassium and sodium ions on each side of the membrane combines with a particular arrangement of the pumps to create an electrical voltage. The ear's natural battery has the highest voltage of any part of the body outside of individual cells, but it is still very low, meaning that any device plugged into it must only harvest a tiny fraction of its power. If it was to divert too much current, it would disrupt the ear's ability to communicate with the brain and any person implanted with a device would lose some of his hearing. In order to get around this, MIT researchers devised a special low-power chip, equipped with an ultra low-power radio transmitter much more efficient than that found in, say, mobile phones. Even then, to directly run the transmitter from the biological battery the chip was also fitted with miniscule power-conversion circuitry - like a tiny version of the boxy converters fitted to many household gadgets' power cables - that gradually built up the charge in a capacitor. Soon to be a thing of the past? External hearing aids could one day be made obsolete by the technology . Dr Stankovic and a colleague implanted electrodes in each side of the membrane in the biological batteries within the ears of their guinea pigs. In the experiments, the chip itself remained outside the guinea pig’s body, but if used in humans it is already small enough to nestle in the cavity of the middle ear. Despite being drastically simplified, the power circuit itself still required a higher voltage than the ear could provide. Although it could drive itself once up and running, it needed a kickstart. The researchers solved that problem with a one-time burst of radio waves which supplied the power for the device to burst into life. Anantha Chandrakasan, who led the team that designed the circuit at MIT's Microsystems Technology Laboratories, said: 'In the very beginning, we need to kick-start it. 'Once we do that, we can be self-sustaining. The control runs off the output.' Cliff Megerian, chairman of otolaryngology at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Case Medical Center told MITnews that one day the technology could power implantable hearing aids. 'The fact that you can generate the power for a low voltage from the cochlea itself raises the possibility of using that as a power source to drive a cochlear implant,' he said. 'I’m not ready to say that the present iteration of this technology is ready. [But] if we could tap into the natural power source of the cochlea, it could potentially be a driver behind the amplification technology of the future.' The findings were published in the journal Nature Biotechnology.","MIT team invents devices which draw power from a natural battery which is inside the ear of all mammals .

As Christopher Haughton, 33, was placed in a police van after officers eventually managed to subdue him, he shouted ‘Kill me, kill me, I want to die. I want to come back as Freddie Kruger.’ He added ‘F*****g pigs, I hope you all die, and all your children die,’ as he chanted and hurled Caribbean insults, such as ‘you bumbaclat’. Medical supplies litters the scene near to where the alleged attacks in Kingsbury, North London . When formally arrested at the police . station, he replied: ‘You can f*****g put me in jail for life.

I hope you all get Aids.’ Prosecutor Ed Brown QC added: ‘Those . comments, of course said in very heated moments, show however not only . what, in that disturbed state, he hoped would happen but also what he . had tried to do and had intended to do. ‘They also demonstrate an appreciation of the possible consequences of what he had done in the preceding few minutes.’ The jury heard earlier when police . stopped him before he went on a rampage, Haughton had been looking at . the sky shouting: ‘God help me kill my enemies.’ Haughton took a 10in knife from a . butcher's shop in Kingsbury, north London, last November before . launching his attack on the officers, the Old Bailey was told. Prosecutor . Edward Brown QC said: 'Some of the officers suffered very significant . injuries indeed, all the result of this defendant’s violence. Christopher Haughton is on trial over the alleged attack which took place in November last year . 'It was perhaps only a matter of very good fortune that some of the police officers escaped with their lives.' One officer PC Thomas Harding tried to pin him down with a riot shield but Haughton managed to straddle him and stabbed the officer in the stomach, it was said. As another officer PC Alastair Hinchliff tried to restrain him, he too fell to the floor and Haughton slashed him across the left side of his face from temple to ear with the knife penetrating his cheek into the mouth. He then stabbed PC Hinchliff in the upper and lower arm exposing the muscle and tendons of the arm as other officers struck him with their batons with no effect, it was claimed. As they did that Haughton lashed out twice cutting across PC Andre Robb’s knee causing a 15 cm wound. The Old Bailey heard 'despite his continued violence, officers were able to pin the defendant against the meat display counter, with his head forced downwards.' But as they tried to cuff him, Haughton attempted to stab PC Shaun Haque in the neck but an officer managed to grab his wrists and the blade stopped just millimetres away. It was alleged that as police tried to put Haughton into handcuffs he attempted to stab another officer in the neck . Prosecutor Ed Brown QC said: 'The scene was a dreadful one - officers very badly injured, some critically so and blood everywhere from their injuries, with police and ambulance personnel doing what they could to give first aid to the officers before they were rushed to hospital. 'Uninjured officers succeeded in handcuffing the defendant, placing him in leg restraints and he was taken to a police van. 'Three officers remained in the back of the van to ensure both the safety of the defendant and to control him. He continued to be violent and aggressive even when restrained.' But en route to the cells Haughton spat blood at them claiming he was HIV positive and then bit PC John Carlton on the leg. Police had been called to reports of Haughton shouting out to God while looking upwards to heaven and praying in the street on Kingsbury Road, Harrow, north west London. Two officers tried to speak to him but he refused to calm down before biting PC Stephen Barker on the arm. He then ran to an alley to grab bricks hitting PC Barker on the hand. As back-up arrived Haughton made his way towards the butcher’s shop and threw a breeze block at the patrol car’s windscreen as it attempted to block his escape. He then grabbed tins from a shop to hurl at them before entering the butcher’s. Before launching his alleged attack, Haughton went into a butcher's shop where he took a fillet knife, it was claimed in court . Mr Brown said: 'The defendant was angry and as you will come to appreciate directing all his anger towards the police. 'It was immediately clear why he had chosen to enter the butcher’s. He found a way through to the butchers’ area - through the staff door at the back. This is where the butchers cut and serve the meat. Robert Englund as the character Freddie Kruger in Nightmare On Elm Street . 'The next few moments witnessed a series of frenzied and quick moving attacks by this defendant on the police using the butcher’s knife which caused really significant injuries to three of the officers, potentially fatal, and to another the defendant came within millimetres of causing what would so easily have been a fatal injury. 'These were deliberate and intentional acts by the defendant towards the officers who were attempting to restrain him in what had become a very dangerous situation that he had caused, with the defendant taking no heed whatsoever of the repeated orders to calm down and to stop.' The court heard a month earlier police were called to Haughton’s bedsit in Hopton Road, Wembley, as he played loud music and threatened other residents forcing them to flee. When officers arrived he charged at them armed with a broom and in the violent struggle officers and they had to use CS spray to subdue him. But he managed to bite WPC Vicky Vincent in her thigh drawing blood and only let go when another officer whacked him on his shoulders with a baton. He then spat blood into WPC Alison Spruce’s face. Haughton was on bail when he went on the rampage and 'it demonstrates how his hostility towards the police was not something that arose just on the morning of 19th November. 'It will become plain during the evidence that the defendant was in a disturbed state of mind at the time. In the months that followed he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.' But he added Haughton had the intention to kill the police officers as he had 'called out that he wanted to kill the police who were there, and threatened to do so,' and 'he hoped that the police whom he had injured were going to die. 'His actions were of course determined, dreadful and carried out in real anger, directed at the officers who were trying to detain him. 'The police had plainly become the object of his anger, perhaps as a result of the events in October.' Haughton denies four counts of attempted murder on PC Harding, PC Hinchliff, PC Robb and PC Haque, two counts of ABH on PC Barker and PC Charlton, and one count of attempted GBH on driver PC David Weir relating to the rampage in November 2011. He also denies ABH on WPC Vincent and common assault on WPC Spruce in October 2011.

"By . Anna Edwards . UPDATED: . 05:48 EST, 12 January 2012 . Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman has been named the 'the world's most powerful drug trafficker' by the U.S. Treasury department. The fugitive Sinaloa cartel leader also got a boost from Mexican actress Kate Del Castillo, who said she believed in Guzman more than in the government - but pleaded with him to use his influence for good. It was the latest in an odd series of encomiums for Guzman, who was included this year on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, with an estimated fortune of $1 billion. Billionaire: Mexican Joaquin Guzman, aka El Chapo, has been declared the world's most influential drug trafficker. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City issued a statement saying three of Guzman's alleged associates had been hit with sanctions under the drug Kingpin Act, which prohibits people in the U.S. from conducting businesses with them and freezes their U.S. assets. The two Mexican men and a Colombian allegedly aided Guzman's trafficking operations. The statement quoted Adam J. Szubin, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, as saying the move 'marks the fourth time in the past year that OFAC has targeted and exposed the support structures of the organization led by Chapo Guzman, the world's most powerful drug trafficker.' Plea: Kate del Castillo posted a message to the drug lord . Guzman, who escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 in a laundry truck and has a $7 million bounty on his head, has long been recognized as Mexico's most powerful drug capo. Authorities say his Sinaloa cartel . has recently been expanding his drug business abroad, building . international operations in Central and South America and the Pacific. Del . Castillo, who played a female drug trafficker in the TV series 'La . Reina del Sur' ('Queen of the South'), offered grudging praise for . Guzman in a posting Tuesday on the social media site Twextra, linked to . her Twitter account. 'Today, I believe more in El Chapo Guzman than in the governments who hide truths from me,' she wrote. The . actress did not specify whether she was referring to the Mexican . government, or what she meant when she accused 'governments' of 'hiding . the cures for cancer, AIDS, etc. for their own benefit and enrichment.' The 800-word posting ended with an impassioned plea to Guzman: . 'Mr. Chapo, wouldn't it be great if you . started trafficking with positive things? With cures for diseases, with . food for street children, with alcohol for old people's homes so they . spend their final days doing whatever they like, trafficking with . corrupt politicians and not with women and children who wind up as . slaves?' 'Go ahead, dare to, sir, you would be the hero of heroes, let's traffick with love, you know how,' the message concluded. In a scoop for Mexican authorities, on Tuesday they seized 32.6 metric tons of a precursor chemical used to make methamphetamines at the Pacific coast port of Manzanillo. Swoop: In December the Mexican navy seized 120,000 kilograms of methylamine at the Pacific port of Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico . Mexico's navy said the chemical methylamine came in a shipment from China, but did not say whether Manzanillo was the final destination of the shipment. Authorities seized almost 675 metric tons of the chemical at sea ports in December alone, all of which was destined for Guatemala. Experts say that when another chemical is added, methylamine can yield its weight in uncut meth.","Included on Forbes list of world's richest people .

The senior bankers who brought Britain to the edge of financial collapse will enjoy pension nest eggs totalling more than £100million. The biggest winners are receiving – or will receive when they retire – gold-plated pensions worth at least £300,000 a year, with one landing a massive £1.4million. By comparison, the average private sector worker does not even have a company pension. The basic state pension is worth a maximum of just £5,600 a year. Financial futures: Larry Fish's annual pension is a cool £1.4million while Fred Goodwin (right) picks up £342,500 . An investigation looked at the directors of the five banks – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, HBOS (owner of Halifax), Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley – which were bailed out by the taxpayer following the credit crunch. The total transfer value of pensions for the 23 executive directors on the boards of the five banks when they failed is a total £107million. Lord Oakeshott, a leading Liberal Democrat peer, said: ‘Irresponsible bankers will enjoy these vast fruits of failures for the rest of their lives. ‘That really sticks in the throats of hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs or businesses, and millions whose pensions were savaged by the banking crash.’ The golden nest eggs: The bankers who will pick up huge pensions despite their actions . The research, by The Times, added in one extra director – Sir James Crosby, the former chief executive of HBOS, who left in 2006 after aggressively expanding the bank. Among the big winners is Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, who was later stripped of his knighthood. He was entitled to an annual pension of £703,000, but eventually volunteered to cut it to £342,500 a year after a public outcry. Unimpressed: Lord Oakeshott hit out at the pension sizes, saying they 'stick in the throat' of those who lost out in the crash . His former rival, Adam Applegarth at Northern Rock, which was the first bank to collapse in the financial crisis, will get £305,000 a year. John Mann, a Labour MP who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘The banks have not got the message at all. ‘They . presume that one way or the other they will get away with their role . [in the crisis]. And these pensions demonstrate that, in a way, they . have got away with it.’ Other . winners include Peter Cummings, the former HBOS banker,  who was given a . £500,000 fine and a lifetime ban by the City regulator in September for . his role in the banking crisis. Mr . Cummings, who gets a pension worth £369,000 a year, insists his . treatment by the Financial Services Authority was ‘tokenism at its  most . sinister’. Rewarded: Adam Applegarth (left) of Northern Rock takes £305,000 a year while Peter Cummings picks up £369,000 . The biggest beneficiary is Larry Fish, who ran Royal Bank of Scotland’s US operations Citizens before its collapse, who gets a pension of £1.4million a year. Gail Cartmail, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said: ‘These bankers failed the nation  and they failed their staff – they  are the real undeserving being allowed to walk away with gold-plated pensions. ‘When you look at these eye-watering payments, it is astonishing that Unite is having to campaign for a living wage for the lowest paid staff at these banks.’",Larry Fish will take home £1.4million a year with the rest earning at least £300k .
"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 07:22 EST, 28 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:03 EST, 28 November 2012 . Inquest: Jean Blakey, 55, who was shot dead by her son Ian had 'never complained about her illness' and was always smiling, an inquest had heard . A mother shot dead by her son who believed she could not cope with Multiple Sclerosis had ‘never complained about her illness’ and was desperate to live, an inquest heard. Ian Blakey told his mother Jean, 55, he wanted to take her shopping but instead drove to a secluded woodland to kill her and then himself because he 'didn't fancy doing life' in prison for her murder. The 34-year-old, who had taken cocaine and an ecstasy-type drug, rang 999 and told the operator: 'I have killed my mother. She has got MS and I’m sick of the f***** sight of it.' He then killed his pet lurcher and then sat in the car next to her mother's body,  and shot himself dead near Crook Golf Club in County Durham on April 28 this year. In a note left with his ex-partner on the morning of their deaths, Ian, 34,  said he could not watch his mother live with Multiple Sclerosis, a debilitating disease which left her in a wheelchair. However a double inquest conducted by Durham coroner Andrew Tweddle yesterday found that Jean had no wish to die and her partner said she woke up every day with a smile on her face. Ian had called his mother the night before to say he wanted to take her out shopping in nearby Bishop Auckland before going to a pub for lunch. He arrived at the house she shared with her partner of 26-years Harry Mawson and drove her away in Mr Mawson’s Peugeot van, which was modified for her wheelchair. Mr Mawson told the inquest: 'I even showed him how to strap her in and how to take her out. He took her out at five past 11. Twenty minutes later, he did what he did.' Jean’s partner said it was unusual for her to be taken out by her son as the last time he had taken her out was for her 50th birthday - but Jean was looking forward to the trip. Note: Ian Blakey (left) had posted a letter with his ex Samantha Peacock (right) that revealed he was going to kill his mother and then himself because he didn't want to go to jail . Mr Mawson told the coroner that Jean had no wish to die, adding: 'She was not bad as he (Ian) made out. 'She was a happy woman who woke up every morning with a smile on her face. 'She never once complained about her illness. She always greeted her carers with a smile and enjoyed outings with them.' After taking his mother out, Ian , who lived a few streets away from his mother , called the police at 11.25am. A transcript of the 999 call was read out at their inquest held in Crook in which Mr Blakey gave the operator his name and told her he was at Crook Golf Course and said: “I have killed my mother. 'She has got MS and I’m sick of the f***ing sight of it.' Officers found Jean, her son and one of Blakey’s lurchers shot dead in the vehicle. Detective Constable Stephen Hedley told the inquest Jean was found dead in her wheelchair in the back of the van, Ian was in the driver’s seat and the dog in  the passenger foot well. Lured: Ian Blakey said he was taking his mother shopping but took her to woodland near this golf club before killing her, his dog and then himself . Officers also found an unregistered Beretta up and over double barrel shot gun. Before he went to collect his mother, he posted a letter through the door of his ex-partner Samantha Peacock. Extracts were read at the inquest in which Blakey wrote it had 'been on the cards for years' as he was 'mentally unhinged' but never told anyone. Medical records show in 2008 he saw a psychiatrist and complained of feeling depressed, suicidal and hearing voices in his head, but never attended future appointments. The letter added that he could not stand to see his mother 'like that' but he did not 'fancy doing life'. Scene: After he killed his mother near Crook Golf Club (pictured) he rang 999 and admitted he had shot her . DC Hedley said Ian had previously expressed concern about his mother’s health to Ms Peacock and told a friend: . 'You would not keep a lurcher like that. 'If you kept a dog like that you would get done off the RSCPA.' The letter ended with Mr Blakey saying: 'Tell everyone I am sorry, if anyone wants my dogs they are welcome to them.' DC Hedley said another note, which looked like a practice effort for the one sent to Ms Peacock, was found in Ian’s work van. Jean’s partner, Mr Mawson told how Blakey, 34, would visit his mother ‘once or twice a week’ but would only stay for a short time and had no involvement in  her care. County Durham coroner Andrew Tweddle heard that Jean relied on a wheelchair but never stopped enjoying life. DC Hedley said: 'Although the physical effects of her illness were quite marked, she was coping well, was upbeat and approached her illness with good humour.' A post-mortem examination by forensic pathologist Dr Nigel Cooper found trace amounts of cocaine and an ecstasy-like drug in Mr Blakey’s system, as well as prescribed medication he was taking for epilepsy. Dr Cooper, said: 'He may well have been experiencing the effects associated with those drugs prior to his death.' Recording a verdict of unlawful killing on Jean and ruling that Blakey took his own life, Mr Tweddle said: 'There could be no objective justification whatsoever for what was done that day.'

When Kayleigh Renwick visited the doctors with agonising back ache, she assumed she had developed a kidney infection. But just six hours later she was giving birth in hospital. Unbeknown to the 24-year-old nursery nurse, from Stanley, County Durham, already a mum to daughter Grace, she was five weeks overdue. Kayleigh Renwick visited an out-of-hours medical centre suffering from back ache - only to be told she was pregnant. Just hours later, Kayleigh gave birth to baby Lucy five weeks overdue, weighing 7lb 7oz . Ms Renwick said she had not realised she was pregnant because she continued to have periods throughout her pregnancy and bizarrely had actually lost weight - dropping from a size 16 to a size 12 -14. She said: 'You read about women not realising they were pregnant and think ‘how did you not know?’. I had no pram, no cot, nothing. 'I’d given it all away after Grace as was adamant we weren’t going to have another baby.' Kayleigh, from Stanley, County Durham, felt pains in her back when she visited the park with her parter Daniel Madge and their two year-old daughter Grace in May this year. At first she thought her back ache was caused by a kidney infection and visited an out-of-hours medical centre for medication. Ms Renwick said she had not realised she was pregnant because she continued to have periods throughout her pregnancy and bizarrely, had actually lost weight . But as she awaited the results of a routine urine test, a doctor asked her 'how far into your pregnancy are you?' She said she wasn’t pregnant, but was sent to the University Hospital of North Durham for a scan. She said: 'Just after 6pm I was seeing a doctor and by 7.30pm I was at the maternity ward having a scan. 'If they’d said I was four months pregnant I could have got my head around that but they said 'it’s good news, there’s a baby there and you’re 8cm dilated.' 'I couldn’t believe it. My body went into shock and I started throwing up. I had periods throughout the pregnancy and in February was sick a couple of times so did a pregnancy test and it came back negative. There were just no further symptoms.' Lucy was born weighing 7lb 7ozs with very dry, cracked skin. Midwives told Kayleigh when they’d delivered her placenta it had stopped working. Kayleigh said: 'They didn’t know what Lucy had been surviving on and thought she was up to five weeks overdue. 'She was back-to-back and they think tucked behind my pelvis which is why I was getting the back ache. 'Grace has been brilliant with Lucy, it’s like she’s always been here.' Now six-months-old Lucy has been diagnosed with severe Brachycephaly and Plagiocephaly, commonly known as Flat Head Syndrome (FHS), causing her head to misshapen. While a baby’s sleeping position is the main cause of mild FHS other causes include factors in the womb such as a lack of amniotic fluid and the position of the baby. Kayleigh now has to raise £2,000 for a cranial helmet which will re-shape Lucy’s head and is also incurring costs for the family having to travel weekly to a clinic in Leeds specialising in her condition. Treatment for the condition is not available on the NHS as it is classed as a cosmetic problem. Kayleigh said: 'It wasn’t until I took Lucy to the doctor that anyone showed any concern for the shape of her head but it was clear just to look at her it was flat. 'We were referred to a consultant who told us Lucy had Plagiocephaly but because the condition is cosmetic there was little the NHS can do. Lucy was born weighing 7lb 7ozs with very dry, cracked skin because her mother's placenta had stopped working while in the womb . 'You could see straight away her head was misshapen and we didn’t want Lucy to have to grow up with this. Children can be so cruel and I didn’t want that for my little girl. 'I went to the hospital hoping they’d help. If the NHS can fund boob jobs and gastric bands, why can’t they fund a child in need? FHS occurs when a baby’s soft skull bones are subjected to abnormal or prolonged pressure and the baby develops a misshapen head. While Plagiocephaly refers to flatness at the sides of the head, Lucy also has brachycephaly which is flatness at the back of the head. Both conditions can cause changes to a baby’s facial features such as ears and eyes not being aligned and, as with Lucy, their forehead jutting out more than it normally would. Lucy will have to wear the helmet 23 hours a day with the possibility of blisters on her head during the first seven weeks. Kayleigh will need to travel to Leeds every week at a cost of £116 a time for six weeks and then every fortnight after that so Lucy’s progress can be monitored.","Kayleigh Renwick, 24, had actually lost weight and had no idea she was pregnant .

Time is running out in the race to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to keep global temperatures rises below 2C this century, the United Nations warns. Greenhouse gases are being pumped into the atmosphere in such quantities that temperatures are likely to rise at least 3C and up to 5C by 2100 even if government pledges for are kept. Governments must promise and put into action many more measures than they have already committed to if the world is to keep temperatures rises below 2C, scientists and UN officials said. Wind farms offer renewable energy which can cut emissions but are often unpopular . To do so, an international team of scientists said, annual greenhouse gas emissions must be slashed from about 50 gigatonnes (Gt) today to about 44GT by 2020. However, emissions are still rising – they have risen 20 per cent since 2000 – and the report by the United Nations Environment Programme forecasts they will be at about 58Gt by the end of the decade. This would leave an ‘emissions gap’ estimated to be 13Gt and even if government’s delivered the most ambitious of their pledges the gap would still be 8Gt. The gap is 2Gt worse than last year's forecast. Achim Steiner, UN Under-Secretary General and UNEP Executive Director, said: ‘The sobering fact remains that a transition to a low carbon, inclusive Green Economy is happening far too slowly and the opportunity for meeting the 44Gt target is narrowing annually. ‘While governments work to negotiate a new international climate agreement to come into effect in 2020, they urgently need to put their foot firmly on the action pedal by fulfilling financial, technology transfer and other commitments under the UN climate convention treaties. ‘There are also a wide range of complementary voluntary measures that can that can bridge the gap between ambition and reality now rather than later.’ But he remains confident that temperatures can be kept down if there is the political will and that the technical capability exists. He added: ‘There are many inspiring actions taking place at the national level on energy efficiency in buildings, investing in forests to avoid emissions linked with deforestation and new vehicle emissions standards alongside a remarkable growth in investment in new renewable energies worldwide, which in 2011 totaled close to US$260 billion.’ Countries with emission-cut pledges in dark green, draft pledges in light green, no pledges in the palest shade . Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: ‘This report is a reminder that time is running out, but that the technical means and the policy tools to allow the world to stay below a maximum 2 degrees Celsius are still available to governments and societies. ‘Governments meeting in Doha for COP18 now need to urgently implement existing decisions which will allow for a swifter transition towards a low-carbon and resilient world. ‘Governments need to urgently identify how ambition can be raised.’ Friends of the Earth described the publication of the report as a ‘stark warning’ that action needs to be taken urgently. UNEP is confident that 17Gt of greenhouse gas emissions can be cut by 2020 . Estimated emissions through energy efficiency: . Asad Rehman, from the campaign group, said: ‘This report is a stark warning that cannot be ignored - nations must take urgent and comprehensive action to slash emissions to avert a climate disaster. ‘The clock is ticking but there’s still time to act - countries meeting in Doha next week must agree a clear course of action to tackle climate change before it is too late. ‘Current EU plans are hopelessly inadequate – its proposals to cut emissions by 20 per cent of 1990 levels have already been met. ‘Developed nations like Britain must show leadership by getting themselves off the fossil fuel hook and securing the new jobs and economic benefits that building a low carbon economy will bring.’ The report, compiled by 55 scientists from 22 countries, highlighted the need for action but identified several areas where emissions can be cut, such as by walking and cycling instead of using cars, saving forests, and energy efficient appliances. It warned: ‘Current global emissions are already considerably higher than the emissions level consistent with the 2oC target in 2020 and are still growing. ‘To stay within the 2°C limit global emissions will have to peak before 2020. ‘Scenarios that meet the 2oC limit have global emissions in 2050 roughly 40 per cent below 1990 emission levels and roughly 60 per cent below 2010 emission levels. ‘The gap can also be closed by swift and comprehensive action to scale up a wide range of tried-and-true policy actions. ‘These are actions that have worked around the world and in many different sectors, and which are not only beneficial to climate protection, but also satisfy a great variety of other local and national priorities.’","Greenhouse gas emissions need to fall 14 per cent by 2020 but are still rising .

Naturists have accused the BBC of falsifying history by covering up actors in their portrayal of civilisations that would have been naked in Andrew Marr’s History of the World. British Naturism (BN) says that the BBC has ‘admitted to falsification of history’ in the programme about world history after what naturist campaigners labelled as an incorrect depiction of people from past civilisations including people from Africa, Ancient Egypt and Australia. In response to a letter from the campaigners, the BBC reportedly admitted to the inconsistencies, explaining that the costumes used in the dramatic reconstruction were to take into account the ‘sensitivities of the widest possible world audience’. Not nude: An actor depicting a native woman encountered by Christopher Columbus in Andrew Marr's History of the World program as British Naturism accuses the BBC of falsifying history by depicting past civilisations that would have been nude in costumes . A BN spokesman said: ‘At a time when the BBC is under serious criticism for a lack of journalistic integrity, letters received by members of British Naturism show further evidence of misdeeds. ‘The BBC has admitted to the systematic falsification of history for profit and for fear of upsetting anyone. ‘There are at least six falsifications in the few episodes of Andrew Marr’s History of the World that we have reviewed. ‘The facts are actually very clear, as the BBC concedes. The costumes in many of the re-enactments are either dubious or quite undeniably false. No loin cloths: BN says that historical evidence found that Australian Aborigines were a fully nude culture but in the BBC programme they are portrayed wearing loin cloths . ‘In the Exodus from Africa, Ancient Egypt, the Minoans, the Caribs, the Australian Aborigines, and members of a contemporary South American tribe, the costumes were the product of the BBC censors, not history.’ A BBC spokesman said today: 'Andrew . Marr’s History of the World used dramatic reconstruction to bring alive . thousands of years of history. 'When . filming a series for a mainstream audience on BBC One we have to take . into account the sensitivities of the widest possible audience.' In a letter to the naturism group, Paul Kettle from BBC Audience Services wrote: ‘I’m sorry you were disappointed by the compromises in accuracy that we felt obliged to make in the production of dramatic reconstruction in Andrew Marr’s History of the World. ‘You are of course correct in pointing out that, in reality, natives in various scenes in the early part of the series would have been naked. ‘But in making a series like this we have to take into account the sensitivities of the widest possible world audience.’ 'For fear of upsetting anyone': The BBC says that Andrew Marr's (pictured) programme needed to 'take into account the sensitivities of the widest possible audience' BN’s research and liaison officer, . Malcolm Boura said: ‘It is astonishing that the BBC, that once proud . bastion of journalistic integrity, should be sacrificing its reputation . for commercial reasons. ‘The “world audience” referred to is overseas broadcasters paying the BBC to use programmes. ‘We do not pay the BBC licence fee for the systematic falsification of history in the pursuit of profit. ‘The BBC is encouraging attitudes known to result in widespread and often serious harm, mainly to children and young people.’ The BN listed inconsistencies they noted on their website on last Thursday about various civilisations depicted. They included Africans which they said did not wear ‘bikinis or underwear. Both are a recent invention’. Prejudice: Actors depicting Ancient Egyptian culture in History of the World which BN says is 'modern BBC prejudice, not the historical evidence' Of the programme’s portrayal of . Ancient Egypt, BN said: ‘The re-enactment costumes reflect modern BBC . prejudice, not the historical evidence.’ Of Caribs encountered by Christopher .

BN is the UK’s officially recognised naturist organisation which has a membership of around 10,500 people. The BBC has been criticised for the programme in the past. In September Marr was accused by Christians of having a ‘cavalier and unsympathetic’ attitude towards Christianity after failing to include Jesus in the series. Christians, including Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, say the BBC is guilty of ‘a glaring oversight’ for excluding Christ from the series.","British Naturism says the BBC has 'admitted to falsification of history'

A mum was drawn into a quarter-of-a million pound illicit drugs plot when she went on a last minute holiday with her married lover. Eva Makunova thought it was a 'nice surprise' when Maros Kristoff said he was treating her to a week long luxury break in The Gambia. But Newcastle Crown Court heard during the holiday the mum-of-three was duped into becoming a drugs mule and ordered to carry a specially converted suitcase to bring a haul of cocaine and crystal meth through customs and into the UK. Mum Eva Makunova (left) has been jailed for four and a half years at Newcastle Crown Court after she was duped into becoming a drugs mule by her lover Maros Kristoff (right) When the pair were stopped at Newcastle International Airport in May, customs officials found over 2.7g of cocaine in Kirstoff’s luggage and over 1.4kg of crystal meth being carried by Makunova. Judge Paul Sloan QC jailed dad-of-four Kristoff, 33, of Stanley Road, Edmonton, London, for six years and Makunova, 45, of Sebastopol Road, Edmonton, London, for four-and-a-half years. They had both pleaded guilty to importation of class A drugs. In her basis of plea to the court Makunova said Kristoff treated her 'very badly' while they were in Africa and he kept all the money, passports and mobile phones, meaning she had no option but to travel back to the UK with him. Her statement of plea reads: 'Immediately prior to the return trip she realised he had involved her in something unlawful, she was in Africa, could not speak the language and didn’t know what to do.' Makunova gave a full account to investigators after she was arrested. Judge Sloan said he accepted Makunova had been 'exploited' and had a limited function in the illegal enterprise. Snared: The couple were jailed for drug offences at Newcastle Court . Prosecutor Neil Pallister told the court: 'She said he was her boyfriend, although he was married with children and would see each ther once a week. 'He said on the Sunday or Monday before he was going to take her on holiday. 'She thought it was a nice surprise.' Customs officials found the drugs after their suitcases were scanned. The cases were found to have an 'inner shell', with the drugs hidden in a special compartment between that and the outer shell. The court heard Kristoff had been on a 'dummy run' to The Gambia shortly before the smuggling. The flights had been paid for in cash at travel agents in Newcastle by a third party. Gul Nawaz Hussain, defending, said Kristoff got involved in the drugs plot when he fell into debt which he struggled to pay back. Mr Hussain said Kristoff was promised his debts would be wiped off in exchange for the drugs run. He added: 'He does not accept he treated her badly while they were there. However, in the same breath, he acknowledges by getting her involved in this he has to bear responsibility and he does.' Christopher Mitford, defending Makunova said: 'This has been totally devastating for her, she plainly regrets ever becoming involved in this. 'She has never taken any illicit drug in her life. 'She is naive.'","Eva Makunova thought it was a 'nice surprise' of Maros Kristoff to whisk her away to The Gambia .

Aids campaigners, including actor Bill Nighy, have urged world leaders to follow the UK Government's lead and continue to help fund worldwide treatment for the disease. On the eve of World Aids Day, aid agency Oxfam has issued a stark warning that nearly seven million HIV sufferers around the globe are at risk due to a lack of funding to pay for their treatment. The charity has released video footage of ambassador Nighy visiting Malawi to highlight the plight of almost one million people living with the disease in one of the poorest countries in the world. Scroll down for video . Plea: Charity Oxfam has released a video featuring actor Bill Nighy, pictured, to highlight the plight of HIV sufferers in poor countries . A massive £1billion shortfall in the Global Fund to fight aids, TB and malaria has been left by international donors leaving nearly half of HIV sufferers in poverty-stricken countries - includingan estimated 1.4million children - without access to Antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Around 650,000 people in Malawi alone are going without the treatment - which costs just 23 pence per day to provide - with only enough funding to provide a third of sufferers with free treatment. The aid agency fears that the funding shortfall risks undermining the significant progress which has been made to halt the number of new infections worldwide, because people with HIV not taking ARVs are more likely to transmit the disease to others. Nighy said: 'So many people aren’t getting the medicines they need through no fault of their own, simply because they drew the short straw geographically. I met people who had been literally rescued from death by medicines which cost only 23 pence a day. Eye-opener: Love Actually star Bill Nighy travelled to malawi to meet HIV sufferers and aid workers in the video . Criticism: The actor hit out at 'armchair cynics' who disagree with funding AIDS treatment . 'I choose not to listen to the armchair cynics, whose philosophical opposition to aid bewilders me. 'I choose to listen to Mara Banda, a lady I met in Malawi who is living with the HIV virus, who told me quietly and simply that she would be dead if it were not for medicines paid for by our aid.' Ahead of the Chancellor’s Autumn statement on Wednesday, Oxfam has welcomed the UK government’s commitment to meet its aid promises and is urging it to encourage other international donors to do so. Oxfam Chief Executive, Barbara Stocking, said: 'It is heartbreaking that seven million lives are still on the line today, when world leaders promised that they would ensure everyone in the world would have access to HIV prevention, care and treatment by 2010. 'UK aid is helping to improve healthcare in countries like Malawi, but there is still a very long way to go and millions of lives globally are still at risk. 'Now more than ever it’s crucial that international donors follow the UK’s lead and increase their commitments to aid, which for many really does mean the difference between life and death.'

Protest groups and 15 councils will seek to stop the Government’s controversial £34billion high speed HS2 rail project dead in its tracks when they challenge the ‘fundamentally flawed’ project in the High Court from Monday. Ahead of the legal battle they warned ministers: ’You may ignore our protests but you can’t ignore the courts.’ Teams of barristers led by QCs will present five separate legal challenges against the Department for Transport on environmental and financial grounds over a nine day period to prevent the ‘damning blight’ of homes and countryside close to the line. Money wasted: Protesters say the new HS2 project has been 'an abysmal business case and represents extremely poor value for hard pressed taxpayers' money' The judicial reviews are being launched by the umbrella group 51M representing 15 councils along the route, two challenges by the HS2 Action Alliance, as well as Heathrow Hub Ltd and Aylesbury Park Golf Club. The first phase of the scheme for the 225mph trains involves a 143 mile route from London to Birmingham by 2026, followed by a ‘Y’ shaped split to Leeds and Manchester in the North by 2033. Objections to be put to the High Court include Government failure to provide accurate information, failure to comply to environmental statute, failure to assess the impact on communities, failure to adequately assess alternatives, failure to consider the impact of HS2 on other parts of the transport infrastructure, and that the decision on compensation failed to meet Government promises and relied on ‘undisclosed information’. Proceedings start on Monday December 3 and is expected to conclude Tuesday December 11 with the councils first to fire their legal broadside . Transport mess: High Speed HS2 protest poster showing former Transport Secretary Justine Greening and current one Patrick McLoughlin portrayed as Laurel and Hardy . Councillor Martin Tett, Chairman of the 51m alliance and leader of Buckinghamshire County Council said: ‘We are doing this with immense reluctance; however we feel that we have been left with no alternative. ‘ . He said the project has ‘an abysmal business case and represents extremely poor value for hard pressed taxpayers' money’. ‘Far better alternatives exist to . build the infrastructure the country desperately needs more quickly and . at far lower cost. We cannot let the Department for Transport with its . atrocious record on managing key investment decisions not answer for why . these have been ignored.’ Councillor Sarah Hayward, Leader of . Camden Council, said: ‘The judicial review enables us to highlight the . impact of this fundamentally flawed scheme, through the legal system. ‘This scheme will bring a damning . blight to Camden that could last for decades, and the council will fight . for every home and business, brick by brick.’ Stop HS2 Campaign Coordinator Joe .

'My partner has built a business in Essex over the last five years and we were hoping to move to be closer to his work. 'But as our house is 400 metres from the proposed line we are not entitled to any compensation and we are left with a big mortgage on a house that is effectively worthless.’ A Department for Transport spokesman  said: ’HS2 will bring cities closer together, drive regeneration, tackle overcrowding and stimulate economic growth. ‘While it would not be appropriate to comment on the specific claims, the Government is confident that the decisions on HS2 have been taken lawfully and fairly and it is vigorously defending these legal challenges.’ The Prime Minister this week gave a ‘personal undertaking’ to review compensation schemes for properties affected by the planned high speed 2 rail link after being challenged by his former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan. Ms Gillan, whose Chesham and Amersham seat will be home to part of the route, urged a generous package for those who live and work nearby.

The man who sparked protests across the Muslim world with a video mocking the prophet Muhammad was yesterday arrested and jailed for violating his probation. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, 55, has been on probation for a 2010 federal cheque fraud conviction that brought a 21-month prison sentence. Under the terms of his probation, he was not to use computers or the internet for five years without approval from his probation officer. A judge ordered that he be held in jail, as there is a high risk that he could attempt to flee if released on bail. Arrested: Filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, pictured on the set of Innocence of Muslims, is accused of violating the terms of his probation . Jailed: Nakoula was ordered to be detained without bail due to the risk he could abscond . Defence: His lawyer said he risked violent reprisals from Muslim inmates if sent to prison . Nakoula was taken into custody on Thursday, according to a U.S. Attorney's spokesman. At a U.S. District Court hearing in Los Angeles, judge Suzanne Segal denied him bail, saying he had 'every incentive to disappear' and adding: 'The court has a lack of trust in this defendant at this time.' Nakoula had eight probation violations, including lying to his probation officers and using aliases, and he might face new charges that carry a maximum two-year prison term. He will remain behind bars until another hearing where a judge will rule if he broke the terms of his probation. The defendant's attorney Steven Seiden sought to have the hearing closed and his client released on $10,000 bail, adding he was concerned his client would be in danger in federal prison because of Muslim inmates. Subterfuge: Nakoula was accompanied by U.S. marshals and a police convoy after his hearing on Thursday . Custody: Nakoula was taken for questioning on September 15, after his film provoked riots in the Muslim world . In hiding: The filmmaker was driven away by police from his home in Cerritos, California . Protests have erupted around the . Middle East over a 14-minute trailer for the film Innocence of Muslims . that depicts Muhammad as a womanizer, religious fraud and child . molester. The trailer was . posted to YouTube in July, but the violence did not break out until . September 11 and has spread since, resulting in the death of Chris . Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, alongside three other Americans. Nakoula, a Christian originally from Egypt, went into hiding after he was identified as the man behind the trailer. The full story about Nakoula and the film is still very unclear. The movie was made last year by a man who called himself Sam Bacile. After the violence erupted, a man who identified himself as Bacile called media outlets taking credit for the film and said it was meant to portray the truth about Muhammad and Islam, which he called a cancer. The next day, it emerged that 'Bacile' was in fact Nakoula, a former gas station owner with a drug conviction and a history of using aliases. Federal authorities later confirmed there was no Bacile and that Nakoula was behind the movie. Flames: The reaction to the video led to the sacking of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, pictured . Suing: Cindy Lee Garcia says she was misled over the role she would be playing in the controversial video . Before going into hiding, Nakoula acknowledged that he was involved with the film, but said he only worked on logistics and management. A film permit listed Media for Christ, a Los Angeles-area charity run by other Egyptian Christians, as the production company. Most of the film was made at the charity's headquarters. Steve Klein, an insurance agent in Hemet and outspoken critic of Islam, has said he was a consultant and promoter for the film. The trailer still can be found on YouTube. The Obama administration asked Google, YouTube's parent, to take down the video but the company has refused, saying it did not violate its content standards. Meantime, a number of actors and workers on the film have come forward to say they were duped. They say they were hired for a film titled 'Desert Warrior' and there was no mention of Islam or Muhammad in the script. Those references were apparently dubbed in after filming was completed. Actress Cindy Lee Garcia has sued to get the trailer taken down.","Nakoula Basseley Nakoula was sentenced on fraud charges in 2010 .

Mrs Pain, 29, and her sister Angela Hughes-Brooks, 37, lost both their husbands and their father when the Mercedes driven by Mr Pain, 31, flew off the road and hit two trees.  Mrs Pain and Mrs Hughes-Brooks survived the crash. Car crash fatalities (left to right): Andrew Pain, 31, had recently married; Stephen Hughes, 57, was visiting England from the US; Greg Brooks, 39, was on a family day out . A coroner heard that the men died on . June 4 this year at the end of a happy family day out to celebrate the . Pains' recent wedding in the US. They were driving home that evening when the deer appeared in front of the car.  Mr Pain swerved to avoid it and the Mercedes saloon, which he had borrowed from his parents, slid sideways off the road and hit two trees at around 60mph. Financial analyst Andrew, 31, graphic designer Greg Brooks, 39, and the two women’s father, Stephen Hughes, a 57-year-old lawyer, were declared dead at the scene. Wedding day: Andrew and Sarah Pain on their wedding day, weeks before the tragic smash in Oxfordshire . The Oxfordshire coroner heard how Mr Pain and his new American wife, who lived in London, had thrown a wedding celebration party at his parents’ home in Oxfordshire on 2 June for friends who couldn’t travel to their wedding in Baltimore, USA, 10 weeks earlier. On June 4, family members had enjoyed a countryside picnic at idyllic Cherwell House before going hunting and then out for a meal at an Indian restaurant in Oxford. However, tragedy struck on the journey home as darkness fell around 9.45pm. Bride and bridesmaids: Sarah Pain, centre, on her wedding day and her sister, Angela Hughes-Brooks, centre left . In a statement read out on her behalf, . Mrs Pain said: 'The atmosphere in the car was good. It had been a good . day and we were all talking. 'I . remember seeing a deer - it wasn’t a large deer, it was a small deer. When we came around the bend, it was there in the headlights. 'All I can visualise is that deer, I don’t know what happened after that.' The inquest heard how Mr Pain, who was sober, 'violently snatched' to the left to avoid the animal in the road. The . blue Mercedes E230 saloon flew . off the road at around 60mph and hit two trees, killing the three men . instantly.

Scene of the crash: the car driven by Mr Pain hit two trees after it came off the road on the night of 4 June this year . Mrs Pain’s sister Angela, of Maryland, USA, who was in the front passenger seat, clambered out of the vehicle covered in blood and, despite having broken wrists herself, flagged down a coach driver who immediately called 999. In a statement, she said: 'Andy was driving. I was in the front passenger seat because I get car sickness. 'Andy’s driving was careful and safe. We were on the way back to Andy’s parents’ house. The vehicle’s headlights were on and the stereo was off because we were talking. 'Suddenly, a deer jumped out in to the road. This deer was not a fully grown deer, but it was not a baby either. Andy swerved to avoid hitting it and I don’t remember what happened after that.' Family man: Stephen Hughes, who died in the accident, at a party last December . Firefighters had to cut Mrs Pain out of her middle seat in the rear of the car. The bodies of the three dead men were also cut from the vehicle. The inquest heard Mr Hughes and Mr Brooks were not wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash. But collision investigator Stephen Moffatt told the hearing it was unlikely they would have survived even if they had been belted in. 'It’s difficult to overestimate the violence of this collision,' he said. 'When a vehicle strikes a mature tree at this kind of speed, you cannot begin to imagine the noise, the distortion to the vehicle shell, the chaos that occurs inside the vehicle. It’s very lucky, in my opinion, that we have two survivors from this collision.' Mr Moffatt said tyre marks suggested Andrew 'snatched violently' to the left. He added: 'It’s one of those manoeuvres you couldn’t bring yourself to do unless you knew your life was in danger. 'These are instantaneous, knee-jerk reactions using his experience as a driver. It’s over in seconds.' Toxicology tests confirmed none of the men had alcohol or drugs in their systems. Oxford coroner Darren Salter recorded three verdicts of accidental death. Addressing the relatives, he said: 'I would like to pass on my sympathies to you all as a family. This is a case which, in many ways, is unimaginable. 'This was the tragic loss of three lives from the same family on a return trip from a happy family day out. I once again pass on my condolences to you as a family.'","Newly-wed Sarah Pain and her sister Angela Hughes-Brooks both lost husbands and their own father .

Brave: Abigail, who died on November 10, never complained about her illness and refused to give up hope that her condition would improve . When nine-year-old Abigail Lightbown lost more than half a stone after months of being sick every morning, her parents feared she was starving herself to look like body-conscious celebrities. It was six months after the family GP diagnosed an eating disorder that they discovered the truth was much worse. Their daughter had a brain tumour which would eventually kill her. Abigail underwent a major operation and months of chemotherapy following the correct diagnosis, but the cancer returned and she died earlier this month, aged 11. Yesterday the grieving family spoke out about the tragedy. ‘Given the time frame, it is possible it might not have spread if Abigail had had her operation earlier, but nobody will ever know,’ said her father Gary. Abigail first started being sick in August 2010 after returning home to Bolton, Greater Manchester from a holiday seeing relatives in Canada. The family’s GP said that she was suffering from stomach problems, leading to fears that she had an eating disorder. After Abigail was examined by a hospital paediatrician, she was given a prescription of tablets to treat acid reflux, but over seven months she was sick every morning and lost nearly 9lbs. ‘Her appetite started going – she was never a fussy eater and always had a fantastic appetite,’ said her mother Bernie, 34. ‘We would try and tempt her with her favourite foods, but it just wasn’t happening. ‘That’s when I thought it was possibly an eating disorder. ‘She has never been image conscious, but I couldn’t think of any other reason. ‘I know how some girls are these days seeing all the celebrities in magazines and on TV, and I tried to catch her out. ‘We had rows about it and she would get really upset.’ Undetected: Abigail, pictured here with her Dad, Gary, mum, Bernie and brother Jack was throwing up every morning, leading parents to think it was an eating disorder. Celebrity visit: Abigail, pictured with her brother Jack, 6, and Manchester United footballers Jonny Evans (right) and Darron Gibson. Abigail had her blood tested that December – but results showed no abnormalities. It  was only the following spring, after she fainted and complained of pins and needles in her legs, that an MRI scan was carried out at Bolton Royal Hospital, revealing the presence of  a tumour. Abigail underwent a seven-hour operation to remove 95 per cent of the tumour and also had  chemotherapy. However, further tests revealed that the tumour was cancerous. Despite a 48-week course of intensive  radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the cancer returned. Doctors pronounced the tumour inoperable just weeks before Abigail was due to start secondary school. She died in Derian House Children’s Hospice with her parents and six-year old brother Jack by her side on November 10. Speaking of Abigail’s bravery in the face of adversity, Mr Lightbown said: ‘We are so proud of our daughter. People don’t understand how inspiring and motivating she has been.

Warehouse manager Mr Lightbown, 44, will trek across the Great Wall of . China with colleagues next year to raise money for Brain Tumour . Research. He said: ‘We just can’t believe how little money and effort goes into raising awareness about brain cancer and the symptoms. ‘We honestly believed Abigail had an eating disorder. ‘Yet brain tumours kill more women under the age of 35 than breast or any other cancer. ‘Doctors and families need to be more aware of the deadly threat of brain tumours in children. ‘We just want to make parents and doctors aware that if a child is constantly being sick that it may be a brain tumour.’ Experts say brain tumours are the . single most deadly form of cancer for under-40s, yet receive only a . fraction of the funding for research spent on other forms of the . disease.","Cancer discovered after seven month battle during which she lost 4kg .

Platt died trying to rescue their dog in the . Clwedog River, North Wales . A couple drowned in a swollen river after apparently trying to rescue one of their dogs from the fast-flowing waters. Alicia Williams and her fiance David Platt, both 25, had been walking their four pets at a flooded beauty spot when the tragedy happened. One of their dogs, a whippet, ran to a nearby car wash. A worker there sensed something was wrong and decided to investigate. He then found the other three dogs – soaking wet and shivering  – and moments later saw Miss Williams’s lifeless body on a sandbank. Police launched a search and rescue operation and found Mr Platt’s body seven hours later floating 200 yards downstream. The couple, who had been together for 18 months, regularly walked their pets along the River Clywedog, which flows through the National Trust-owned Erddig Country Estate, near Wrexham. Locals said the river was 4ft higher than usual after two days of heavy rain. Car wash worker Michael Morgan, 49, said he was alerted to the accident when the whippet ran over to him just after 5pm on Wednesday. ‘I was kneeling down polishing a car and the next thing I knew there was this dog licking my ear,’ he said. ‘I felt like something wasn’t right so decided to go and look to see if someone had fallen over or got their car stuck in mud.’ He then saw three more dogs – two retrievers and a Jack Russell – sitting beside a Citroen Picasso, which is thought to have belonged to the couple. ‘The whippet was pulling on the rope towards these dogs so I thought he knew them,’ Mr Morgan added. Danger: . The River Clywedog where the couple drowned. Witnesses said Miss . Williams' body was lying in the shallow part of the river and said the . water had been flowing very fast this week . Memory: Tributes have poured in for the couple, . who lived locally. Miss Williams is pictured in photos from social . networking sites. It is presumed that the pair drowned but a post mortem . hasn't been carried out yet . He then saw the body of a woman lying on her back. ‘If it wasn’t for the whippet coming over we wouldn’t have realised what was going on, he was definitely trying to tell us something,’ said Mr Morgan. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Pierce, of North Wales Police, said: ‘No one witnessed the couple going into the river, but property belonging to them was found on the river bank. It is only speculation to say they went in after one or more of the dogs. We haven’t got any witnesses to confirm that. ‘The river was in flood, areas of grassland on the banks were covered in water after torrential downpours in this part of North Wales over the last few days.’ The couple lived together in Ruabon, near Wrexham. Mr Platt’s uncle, Peter Wright, 44, described his farm worker nephew as a ‘strong, lovely lad’. ‘Alicia was a lovely girl and they loved each other very much. They had just got engaged,’ he said. ‘David was the type of lad who would come and give you a hug in the street.’ Paying their respects: David Platt's uncle Peter Wright, far right, with his family near the river Clywedog near Wrexham, north Wales where David Platt drowned .

Jesus has a condition known as Hyper Trichosis, which affects very few people in the world. Jesus suffers from a very rare condition called a condition known as Hyper Trichosis, which causes abnormal hair growth . Attraction: Jesus, pictured today at Wookey Hole, Wells, Somerset has performed at circuses throughout the world . He is the first Wolf Boy to set foot in Great Britain for 30 years and his arrival has been a closely guarded secret. The Circus of Horrors reached the finals of Britain's Got Talent last year. Judge Simon Cowell said: 'I loved it and I'm sure the royal family would love to watch this’, while David Hasselhof added: 'Fantastic, that’s what I call entertainment'. The self proclaimed freak show, which has a Berlin in the 1920s theme, brands itself as 'hair-raising entertainment and bloodthirsty burlesque'. Grimace: 'Wolf Boy' joins the Circus of Horrors, which started in 1995 and reached the finals of Britain's Got Talent in 2011 . It is famous for its gruesome stunts, including Garry Stretch and his record-breaking elastic skin, contortionists, acrobats and The Dwarf Demon Dan, who had to have surgery to remove a vacuum cleaner hose after he tried to drag the appliance with his genitals during a 2007 show. The show's website proclaims: 'If Quentin Tarantino had directed Cirque Du Soleil then you would be only half way there.' A total of 24 people in the football fan's family have the condition, with varying degrees of severity, inlcuding his sister Lili and his cousins Danny and Larry. His daughter daughter Carla is one of them. Hypertrichosis (also called Ambras syndrome) is an abnormal amount of hair growth on the body. Extensive cases of hypertrichosis have informally been called 'Werewolf Syndrome'. Hypertrichosis can be either present at birth or acquired later in life. Several circus sideshow performers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Julia Pastrana, had hypertrichosis. Many of them worked as freaks and were promoted as having distinct human and animal traits. The first recorded case of hypertrichosis was Petrus Gonsalvus of the Canary Islands in 1648. Two daughters, a son, and a grandchild in Gonzales' family all had the condition. The Wolf Man will appear alongside Garry Stretch and his record-breaking elastic skin .

Francois Hollande was due to hold crisis talks with Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal today after Boris Johnson encouraged him to give up France and move to Britain. The London Mayor accused the Socialist government in Paris of acting like working class revolutionaries - or 'sans culottes' - after telling Mittal, one of the richest men in the world, to get out of their country. On Monday, President Hollande's industry minister Arnaud Montebourg accused Mr Mittal's company, ArcelorMittal, of 'lying' and 'blackmail' and suggested he left, along with his 20,000 jobs. Francois Hollande (left)  is due to hold crisis talks with Indian Steel Magnate Lakshmi Mittal following comments made by his Industry Minister. London Mayor Boris Johnson waded into the controversy today  telling a gathering of Indian businessmen in Delhi they should relocate from France to Britain . Boris Johnson, seen here shaking hands with Harshpati Singhania, the Chairman Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce, infuriated French socialists when he suggested companies should move to Britain . Way to go: The London Mayor told the gathering: 'I have no hesitation in saying here, Venez Londres, mes amis!' which translates as 'Come to London, my friends!' This prompted Mr Johnson to tell a meeting of Indian business leaders: 'The sans-culottes appear to have captured the government in Paris. I have no hesitation in saying here, Venez Londres, mes amis!' which translates as  'Come to London, my friends!' French Socialist Party sources today said they were furious by Mr Johnson's intervention, saying he had 'completely missed the point' of Mr Montebourg's words. 'He was not attacking a company for being in France, but for treating workers so badly,' one source told the Evening Standard. 'The idea was that countries like France should have some control over the decisions of international business people. In these circumstances, Mr Johnson's intervention was most unwelcome.' French Minister for Industrial Recovery Arnaud Montebourg accused ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer owned by Lakshmi Mittal, (left) of lying and blackmail and suggested they should leave the country . Mr Mittal, who has a number of other . business interests in France, was accused by Mr Montebourg of giving up . on France after he announced the closure of two blast furnaces in the . north-eastern region of Florange. Mr . Hollande will discuss a number of measures aimed at resolving the . dispute today, including the possibility of temporarily nationalising Mr . Mittal's assets. The . Anglo-French row over the best place to do business follows Prime .

Mr Cameron said that by paying British . taxes, French firms could help 'pay for our health service and schools . and everything else'. But Claude Bartolone, leader of the Paris parliament, said his countrymen who moved to London for lower tax rates always returned to France for medical care and schools because public services 'no longer exist' in Britain.

A pensioner is pleading with the NHS to turn her from a woman back into a man, after realising the sex change operation she had 23 years ago was a huge mistake. RAF veteran Gary Norton, 75, underwent a full male to female gender reassignment  - but says it left her trapped in the wrong body. She's now ditched her wardrobe of women's clothes to live as a man again and is on the waiting list for a mastectomy. The pensioner, who is legally and still physically a woman, says she is desperate to return to her birth sex before it is too late. Gary has extended a desperate apology to her family, who disowned her after they discovered her secret life . Gary, who changed her name to Gillian after her wife and four children disowned her, says she knew the sex change was a mistake when she grew sick of doing her hair and make up and continued to be attracted to straight women. She says: 'I'm a red-blooded man and always have been. I still can't believe this happened to me. I should never have been given the op. I tried to make a success of it, what else could I do? 'But I've been living a lie. The sex change was a huge mistake. 'I was vulnerable and I was given poor advice which has ruined my life. I don't want this to happen to anyone else.' Gary, of Coventry, is pleading with doctors to turn her back into a man, claiming she should never have been operated on. But her local Primary Care Trust have so far refused to fund a reversal. Gary wants to warn others considering the operation and apologise to her family for the decision to change genders . Gary said she tried to embrace her new life by wearing clothes and make-up - but realised she had never wanted to be a woman . Now she wants to warn others considering the operation and extend a desperate apology to her family who have disowned her. Gary says: 'Having a sex change was the biggest mistake of my life. It has left me isolated from my children and feeling like a social misfit. I would do anything to see them again. 'I'm lonely because I want a relationship with a woman but I can't have a physical relationship because I've got no equipment. 'I want to advise others to think twice, it's one heck of a mistake to make and as I have found out there is no going back.' Gary's horror story began when she sought help for depression from her GP after being made redundant. During the meeting she admitted to dressing in her wife's clothes for a secret thrill. She says she now realizes this was as far as she ever wanted to go. But she claims her GP concluded she could have been depressed because she wanted to be a woman and advised her to start taking hormone pills. After 23 miserable years spent as a woman Gary said she donated all of her dresses to a charity shop and stopped taking hormone pills . Gary says: 'I was desperate to be happy so I did as he said and started taking the pills. Before I knew it my beard had stopped growing and I grew breasts. 'I was fascinated and hoped feeling like a woman would make me feel better.' But Gary didn't tell her wife of 25 years and their four children. ' I dressed as a woman in secret but in public nobody guessed. I knew they would be horrified and was too afraid to tell them.' 'My daughter got married months after I started taking the pills and I gave her away terrified that somebody would notice the father of the bride had grown breasts. 'Of course I bound them tightly under my shirt and prayed nobody would spot them.' Six months on Gary's marriage ended in 1986 without her wife guessing the secret. It was only after she moved out that she found a box of women's clothes in the loft belonging to Gary. Gary wants to have his procedure reversed, saying that he has been a 'red-blooded man' all along and the procedure left him feeling confused and upset . She says: 'I got a call from my son telling me they were all disgusted and wanted nothing more to do with me. 'I tried to call and wrote to explain but they never spoke to me again.' Meanwhile her GP had referred her to a psychiatrist who diagnosed Gary as suffering from gender identity disorder and suggested she consider a sex change. 'I went along with it because I trusted them and thought they must be right even if I had never considered myself trapped in the wrong body before. Looking back I think all the female hormones had fuddled my mind.' Now working as an architect she kept his secret by dressing as a man during the day right up until the surgery. But on the morning of the operation in London in April 1989 Gary started to panic. 'I put it down to nerves, but even in the operating theatre a voice in my head said it was a mistake, but I felt it was too late to back out. I had gone too far. The next thing I knew I woke up a woman.' She said the operation had essentially left her a lesbian and she has struggled with relationships ever since . But to her horror when she looked in the mirror, she didn't feel happy or content, just upset and more confused. 'I did my best to embrace it; I bought bikinis and nice dresses. I spent time on my hair and make up and always had lovely manicured nails. 'I wrote to my children to tell them, I hoped they would accept me but they didn't.' 'I was so lonely, especially because I thought when I was a female I might be attracted to men, but I still only fancied women and always have done. 'The operation had essentially left me a lesbian, something I had never considered and wasn't happy about.' Within the first year Gary had grown sick of doing her hair and make up and even hated dressing in women's clothes full time. 'It . was all so fussy and time consuming. It was then it hit me, I hadn't . wanted to be a woman - I just liked dressing up as one from time to time . for a thrill and it should never have gone any further. 'It . was devastating. I was a man trapped in a woman's body and I was stuck . with it. It was too late to do anything about it. I couldn't believe I . had gone so far. The pensioner is warning others about the procedure after his experience . In 1990 . one year after the operation she wrote to her psychiatrist for help . saying the operation had been a mistake and asked if she could have it . reversed. 'He replied to say I needed to get on with it and embrace life as woman and make a success of it. 'What choice did I have?' In the years that followed she took up modelling and dance classes, but no matter what she did Gary never felt like a woman. 'I passed well as a woman and those who knew said they all thought I had been born that way. 'But I always felt it was an act. I was pretending waiting for it to feel 'right' but it never did. Eventually after 23 miserable years she had had enough of living a lie and took all of her women's clothes to the charity shop. Last year she stopped taking pills to let her facial hair grow back and started dressing as Gary again. 'My breasts remained so I covered them up with baggy tops. I looked like a man again and felt like a man again. The relief was indescribable. 'I knew I wanted to the man I had been born in every sense and went to my GP to enquire about a reversal. I told him the operation had been a mistake. In my mind I was misdiagnosed and should not have been operated on. 'He prescribed testosterone and recommended me for a mastectomy.

Apple has fired a second senior manager following the debacle over the flop launch of its map application, which was savaged by furious users immediately after it launched in September. The problematic map app was described by Apple at the time as 'the most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever.' However within hours CEO Tim Cook had issued an apology to customers and Apple was recommending customers use alternative apps while the company worked at improve their own dismal offering. Richard Williamson had overseen the mapping team responsible for the unreliable app which is notorious for providing incorrect landmark searches and routes that get users lost. All change at Apple: Vice President Eddy Cue has rung the changes and sacked Richard Williamson who had overseen the mapping team . A difficult road ahead: Apple's maps were slammed for their poor location information and distorted images, forcing the company into issuing an apology . Williamson has apparently been pushed out by Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, who took over last month as part of a management shakeup, reports Bloomberg. Williamson is the second senior manager to be forced out over the disastrous map app, mobile-software chief Scott Forstall was ousted last month in a management overhaul. Sources . said Forstall refused to sign a public apology after Apple's mapping . product, which displaced the popular Google Maps on the iPhone and the . iPad in September, contained embarrassing errors and drew fierce . criticism. Cue, a long-serving executive who runs online products, was also put in charge of maps and the Siri voice-recognition tool, bringing all of the company’s online services under one group. Apple continues to seek advice from outside mapping-technology experts and digital maps provider TomTom to fix the faulty app. Google is now preparing to unveil rival downloadable apps for Apple’s mobile devices. Prior to the launch of Apple Maps, Google's mapping application had been built into Apple’s iPhone since its introduction in 2007. Map app disaster: Apple's application has left users scratching their heads when trying to use it . Scott Forstall was asked to leave Apple after reports he refused to take responsibility for its map debacle . A team at Apple has been working to fix the mapping mistakes, focusing first on some of the most glaring problems. The . new version of Apple’s iOS mobile software removed Google’s built-in . maps app in favor of its own, which added new features such as . turn-by-turn navigation and fly-over views of landscapes. While Apple has enjoyed enormous success since Cook took the helm, recent stumbles including the Maps debacle and several earnings disappointments have underscored the long-term challenges the company faces in retaining its dominance in the smartphone and tablet markets. In Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics, Apple faces an array of powerful competitors who are determined to own a piece of the exploding mobile-computing market. 'Competition is moving much faster to be more Apple-like,' said Tim Bajarin, president of technology research and consulting firm Creative Strategies. Last month's executive changes hand substantially more responsibility to Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple's celebrated industrial design chief, who will now oversee both hardware and software design. Sir Jonathan Ive: The British born designer now oversees the look and feel of Apple's hardware and software . Craig Federighi, who oversees the OSX software that powers the Macintosh computers, has also taken charge of the iOS software. Putting the mobile and personal . computer software teams together under Federighi could improve . operations within the company, particularly as the capabilities and . features of smartphones and PCs increasingly converge, said analysts. Ive, now responsible for design across . all products, has played a key role in Apple's success by imbuing its . gadgets with a distinct look and feel. BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said .

Officials have banned Christmas lights from a busy High Street for the first time in 20 years unless traders fork out up to £4,000 to have lampposts tested for health and safety reasons. Furious residents and local business owners have slammed a new rule which means the West Wickham Town Centre Association must pay for test certificates to ensure lampposts are strong enough to support Christmas lights. The charge was introduced after the High Street was designated a red route, meaning it is managed by Transport for London (TfL) rather than Bromley Council. In happier times: How West Wickham looked during previous festive seasons . Unseasonal: West Wickham High Street could be without its Christmas lights this year . As one of London’s major roads, the High Street carries up to 30 per cent of city traffic. Secretary of the association Jane Avis manages the family-run shop Waterways, in the High Street, which has been running for more 30 years. She said: 'We’ve had Christmas lights for over 20 years. My mum used to do it and then I took it over. 'It doesn’t make a massive difference to trade, it just gives a good community feeling. 'West Wickham High Street has been a red route for four or five years and they never asked for anything. 'But last year they said we need to comply with regulations which are different to Bromley Council’s. 'We’re going to fight them all the way. We won’t let them dampen our Christmas spirits.' Resident Charles Sebestyen, a 70-year-old . retired property executive who has lived in the area for around 35 . years, said: 'It has killed the Christmas spirit in the West Wickham . area. Fed up: Traders in West Wickham are furious their High Street might be without Christmas lights this year . 'TfL is being ridiculous. I simply do not understand how something that has worked for a long time is now suddenly unsafe.' Mr Sebestyen, a member of West Wickham Residents’ Association, added: 'It’s just sad because in this economic climate, the traders can’t afford it. 'David Cameron talks about the big society where people do something for themselves and this is what happens.' Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'With money tight councils don’t have a fortune to spend on Christmas lights. 'Bureaucrats shouldn't be making it more expensive to decorate town centres with some Christmas cheer. Tradition: West Wickham residents hope they will soon put up their own festive street decorations . 'If traders and residents are willing to invest in their community’s festive celebrations then authorities should support that, not get in the way with needless red tape and bureaucracy.' TfL director of roads Dana Skelley . said: 'Safety on our road network is the top priority and any additional . attachments to a lighting column on our road network have to be fully . considered to ensure their weight or size does not have the potential to . put the public at risk. 'That is why we have a clear . licensing procedure in place to help ensure any applications for . decorations can be assessed appropriately. 'Hundreds of these licences are issued for festive decorations across London every year however we are meeting with local traders tomorrow to discuss the matter, with a look to finding a workable solution.' Councillor . for renewal and recreation Peter Morgan said: 'The traders have worked . extremely hard to gather funds together to decorate their High Street . and we have supported them in this. 'We are now pressing TfL, who are . responsible for this road as a red route, to see if anything can be done . to rectify this situation in time for Christmas.' A Transport for London spokesman said £4,000 was the maximum charge for the tests, which would cover a £75 admin fee plus any additional charges required to restrict traffic along the road to install or remove the decorations.","West Wickham traders charged £4,000 to test whether lampposts can hold Christmas decorations .

Investigators have found no DNA link between a professional tennis referee charged with killing her husband and the coffee mug police say she used to kill him, the woman's attorney claims. Lois Goodman, 70, was arrested in August while she was preparing to officiate at the US Open Tennis Championships and accused of killing her 80-year-old husband, Alan Goodman, at their home in Los Angeles. Police believe she used a coffee cup to bludgeon and stab Mr Goodman to death on April 17. Accused: Lois Ann Goodman, seen after her arrest in New York, denies killing her elderly husband at their home in Los Angeles, California in April . Eighty-year-old Mr Goodman . was found dead in the couple's home after what authorities first . believed was a fall down the stairs. They . began to suspect foul play after a mortuary reported suspicious . injuries on Mr Goodman's head, including glass fragments with a . blood-covered coffee mug found nearby. Ms Goodman . was arrested in New York on August 21 shortly before she was due to . referee at a US Open tennis match. But her attorney, Robert Sheahen now claims the DNA found on the coffee cup 'came back . solely to the husband and not to Ms Goodman.' He said this 'supports our theory . that the husband was holding the cup and then he fell on the cup, and . that accounts for the shattered pieces of the cup being embedded in the . right side of his head,' he said. The DNA testing results were included in exchanges of materials between . defense attorneys and prosecutors as part of the pre-trial discovery . process, Mr Sheahen said. 'Victim': The tennis referee's husband of nearly 50 . years, Alan . (left), was found covered in blood next to a broken mug. Ms Goodman (right) told police she found him after returning to their home in LA and . believed he had fallen . Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, declined to comment on Mr Sheahen's statements. 'We're not going to try this case outside of court and we're not going . to comment on the evidence until it's actually testified to in the court . of law,' Ms Gibbons said. The defense discussion of the DNA testing came one month after Ms Goodman's . lawyers said she had passed a lie detector test set up by her attorneys . in which she denied killing her husband. Mr Sheahen said the polygraph results had been shared with prosecutors. But . under California law, the test cannot be presented in court unless both . prosecutors and defense attorneys agree, which he acknowledged is . unlikely. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for December 7. Prosecutor John Lewin of the major crimes division has been assigned to . the case. Mr Lewin has prosecuted a number of complex, high-profile trials, . including one in 2007 where a former Los Angeles County sheriff's . deputy was convicted for the 1991 murder of his wife, even though her . body was never found. Lawyers representing Lois Ann Goodman, centre, have argued that the death of Alan Goodman was 'a freak accident' Police said Ms Goodman called authorities to report finding her husband . dead in their home, with no sign of forced entry, and surmised he had . fallen down some stairs after suffering a heart attack. But details of her account aroused suspicions, and investigators found . that the coffee cup was broken in a way that roughly matched the . injuries on Mr Goodman's head. Mr Sheahen said Mr Goodman was likely to have been holding the mug and that, at the end of a . fall down the stairs, he would have smashed his head against the it. Ms Goodman is well known in tennis circles and had worked at the annual . US Open in recent years, serving most often as a line judge. A judge . has allowed her to remain confined at home while the case proceeds. Ms Goodman was arrested in New York in August shortly before she was due to referee at the world-renowned US Open tennis tournament . Ms Goodman, 70, was released to home confinement in California after her attorneys successfully argued for a bail reduction . Ms Goodman's daughter has described the allegations against her mother as 'completely ridiculous'. The . prosecution has claimed Mr Goodman was struck 10 times on the head, and . argued there was evidence of his wife's pre-meditation and lack of . remorse. Prosecutor Sharon . Ransom previously told a judge that Ms Goodman went to get a manicure while . her husband lay dying. But defence attorney Alison Triessl claimed her client was physically incapable of committing the crime, saying that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, . hearing loss and constant spinal pain that is controlled by an electronic . device implanted in her spine. Scene: Alan Goodman was found dead at the couple's condominium on April 17 in Woodland Hills, pictured . She . had told detectives that she arrived home and found a trail of blood leading . upstairs to a broken mug covered in blood. She followed the blood to her . bedroom, where she found her husband not breathing, according to the . affidavit. She then dialled 911. Investigators . also believed a large bloodstain near the stairs suggested he had . suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said. When . she was questioned again, Mrs Goodman said the body looked as if it had . been positioned by an intruder. Despite these conflicting accounts, . Ms Goodman has protested her innocence. She . has refereed at the US and Australian Opens for years and has umpired . with some of the world's top tennis players, including matches with . Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova. In . a 1994 interview with the LA Times, she said: 'It's exciting.

Controversial: Drugs Live, presented by newsreader Jon Snow, has been accused of glorifying the drug ecstasy . It was billed as an opportunity for scientists to investigate the impact of ecstasy on the brain. But last night critics and viewers accused Channel 4 of turning Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial into little more than a ratings-grabbing advert for the Class A drug. They also asked why the only expert to point out the dangers of taking drugs was given just three minutes of the 65-minute-long programme to voice his concerns. The show – billed by the broadcaster as one of its ‘boldest projects yet’ – saw  25 volunteers, including a vicar and author Lionel Shriver, take an 83mg tablet of MDMA – pure ecstasy – or a placebo. Each then underwent a series of tests, including a brain scan,  while changes to their mood, memories and emotions were monitored. Jon Snow, who is hosting the two-part series, insisted the research was vital because ‘incredibly, no one knows how [ecstasy] works or how harmful it is’. However, many viewers complained that instead of focusing on the science, producers instead merely wanted to talk about the volunteers’ experiences. Only one man, a former SAS soldier, was shown to have had a negative response, while the  majority of the volunteers described feelings of well-being, euphoria, and warmth. Method: 25 people were given either MDMA or a placebo and their brain, articulation and feelings were tested . Viewer Sarah Durbridge wrote on . Twitter: ‘Watching Drugs Live. Teenager watching too.... It’s a great . advert for E – not what I was hoping for’, while Dan Darby added: ‘Think . everyone is going  to be on MDMA at the weekend after this great . commercial on Channel 4 Drugs Live.’ Pills: Ecstasy is made using the drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA - which critics say is dangerous . Another viewer wrote: ‘Drugs live has made me want to do drugs for the first time in years.’ The trial on Wednesday, which . operated under a Home Office licence, was funded by Channel 4 and led by . Professor Val Curran, of University College London, and Professor David . Nutt, from Imperial College. He was sacked as  the government’s drugs tsar in 2009 for saying ecstasy was less dangerous than horse riding. Campaigners also pointed out that . while just one scientist  spoke of the serious risks associated with . ecstasy use, both professors were given extra time to discuss their more . liberal views. Mary Brett, of campaign group Europe Against Drugs, said: ‘The whole thing was just an ego trip for Nutt. 'He is a self-publicist and doesn’t seem to be able to bear being out of the limelight. It is anything for publicity. ‘This is not the way to conduct . scientific experiments. You do research quietly, conduct it on  lots of . people, you write it up and publish it in a journal that is . peer-reviewed. The whole thing was just an advert for taking ecstasy.’ She also claimed that while Professor . Andy Parrott, one of Britain’s leading experts on ecstasy, tried three . times to emphasise the dangers of the drug, he only got around three . minutes of airtime. Experiment: Author of We Need to Talk About Kevin - Lionel Shriver - is given a pill . The programme concluded last night by . inviting viewers to share their experiences of taking ecstasy  and . discuss the long-term effects of persistently using it. Niamh Eastwood, of drug charity . Release, said: ‘The show did talk about potential harms and the panel . was reasonably balanced. Its objective was a scientific study into the . impact of MDMA on the brain and it met that objective well.’ A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘The . programmes aim to cut through the emotional debate surrounding ecstasy, . inform the public about the effects and potential risks of MDMA, and . allow people to discuss the issues raised.’","Channel Four's Drugs Live has courted controversy with critics saying it glorifies the drug .

A Romanian who used a cash machine skimming device to obtain 9,000 PINs was facing jail yesterday. Leonid Rotaru, 32, was caught red handed as he returned to collect a card reader from an ATM he had tampered with. Police raided his home and found details of 9,000 bank cards on his home computer which could potentially have allowed him to steal as much as £3.25million. Barry Douglas, of Avon and Somerset police Economic Crime Unit, said Rotaru was part of a well-organised criminal enterprise. ‘You can tell from the quality of the equipment that was attached to the ATM, you can tell from the amount of detail that was found on the computer,’ he said. ‘This was well organised, well orchestrated and with good criminal connections.’ Rotaru used a highly sophisticated card reader which fitted over the entry slot of ATM machines. Users would unwittingly pass their card through the device, which would record the details stamped on it. A tiny pinhole camera would then film the victim entering their PIN. Mr Douglas said: ‘It fits over the card slot on an ATM and as the card goes in it will read your details off the card. ‘The camera will see you put your pin in. It will see your finger strokes and it will know which card it goes with.’ Rotaru's device included a tiny hidden pinhole camera which would film each person's PIN number, after he was arrested police found the details of 9,000 bank cards on his home computer . Officers reviewed CCTV footage and . spotted Rotaru fitting the device to the ATM. He was arrested when he . returned later in the day to retrieve it. Mr Douglas added: ‘By irony, or total . coincidence, the guy was coming back, we think, to remove the device. The arresting constable had already seen the CCTV of him fitting it . earlier in the day, recognised the person and he was arrested.’ Rotaru, a Romanian national living in . Bridgwater, Somerset, pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and the . possession of various skimming devices in a hearing at Taunton Crown . Court. He was on the run from another police force over similar offences when he was caught. Judge David Ticehurst remanded him in custody and said all options would be open for sentencing. Police estimate that banks lose on average £460 per card in such skimming frauds. Police were called to a cash machine . outside a Tesco store in Minehead, Somerset, after customers reported . their suspicions about the device. The tricks used to steal money from bank accounts are sophisticated, varied and widely used. Skimming is just one type of this fraud, it is when a card’s magnetic stripe data is electronically copied by a criminal. Fraudsters skim cards using a device that is fitted to a cash machine or to a chip and PIN machine in shops or stores. This data is then transferred onto a fake magnetic stripe card and used overseas in countries that have not yet rolled out chip and PIN. The number of counterfeit card fraud losses (which includes those perpetrated by skimming) on UK-issued cards in the UK has actually fallen in the last two years, according to Financial Fraud Action UK. In 2010, this type of crime was worth £47.6million, but in 2011 it had dropped to £36.1million. This drop has been attributed to the increased number of foreign countries who have introduced chip and PIN technology, which makes it much harder to use fake UK cards overseas. The tricks used to steal money from bank accounts are sophisticated, varied and widely used. Here is how they have developed: . Spring traps: Once a card has been inserted, these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the ATM from retracting it. Cash traps: Claw-like implements are inserted into cash-dispensing slot to 'capture or skim some of the dispensed bills'. Jammers: An oversized fork-like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal ATM transaction. Skimmers: Thieves . lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic . strip readers. The data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and . used at ATM along with victim’s PIN to withdraw cash.

A schoolboy who was killed when he was hit on the head by a cricket ball thrown by his friend told him ‘I’m fine’ before collapsing, an inquest heard today. Kyle Rees, 16, got in the way of the ball as his friend went to hurl it across the school playground in a boisterous game. Kyle had urged his friend, who can’t be named for legal reasons, to throw the orange object towards the school IT block. But the teenager then walked into its path and was hit on the side of the head. The boy was initially arrested on suspicion of manslaughter but was released without charge, Kyle’s mother, Tanya Cooper, told the inquest that she did not blame the boy who threw the ball. She said: 'They were really good friends. He is a lovely lad and I feel so bad for him. It must be so hard to have to keep going through it. 'Not for one second have any of us thought he would have done it on purpose. When we found out who had thrown the ball we knew it must have been an accident.' The mother of the boy told of the effect his friend’s death had had on him. She said: 'He is devastated. He is not in the right place. A big part of him died that day. He can’t forgive himself. He was his friend. He can’t forgive himself.' The boy, also aged 16, told of his dying friend’s final words before he slumped to the ground unconscious. He said he grabbed hold of Kyle and asked if he was OK, to which he replied ‘I’m fine, let me sit down’ before stating ‘my head hurts’. Kyle Rees' mother Tanya Cooper at the inquest today, she told the inquest that she did not blame the boy who threw the ball . CCTV footage covering the school playground showed Kyle stumble to his feet before collapsing on the floor. He suffered a massive haemorrhage and died in hospital the next day. The mother of the boy who threw the ball said her son ‘can’t forgive himself’ since the tragedy and that a ‘part of him had died’ when Kyle did. An inquest today heard that the incident happened during the end of the lunch break at Porchester Boys School in Bournemouth, Dorset, on February 27. A pupil climbed on to a flat roof building to retrieve several tennis balls that had been previously hit up there, triggering the impromptu throwing game. After a teacher broke the game up Kyle and two friends discovered a harder ball in the playground. Detective Sergeant Trevor Hawkins, of Bournemouth police, read out a statement made by the boy in question. He said: 'He (Kyle) told me to pass him the ball but I said no. 'He wanted me to throw him the ball but there were teachers about and I didn’t want him to get into trouble. I have it in my hand and we started to walk. He was on my right side. He said ‘throw it.’ 'As I turn to throw it he comes around and is on my right side. I was just throwing it in a bit of space in the middle of the playground. 'He has come round the back of me and I just caught him. I wasn’t quite sure (where the ball hit Kyle), he had his hood up. 'The first thing I did was turn him around and say are you okay. He said ‘yeah, I’m fine just let me sit down’. Then he gets up and sits in the middle of the floor and lies himself down. The tragic incident happened during the lunchbreak at Porchester Boys School in Bournemouth, Dorset . 'He gets on the floor and is breathing heavily. A bit of spit and froth come out of his mouth. That’s when we went to find the medical woman.' Kyle was rushed to the hospital before being transferred to a neurological unit at Southampton General Hospital. Doctors established there was nothing they could do for him and he died the following day with his family around him. GCSE student Kyle lived with mother Tanya Cooper, 42, his two elder brothers and sister at a semi-detached house in the Charminster area of Bournemouth.

Wendy Maguire, 16, who fell to her death from a footbridge after downing shots of alcohol . A teenager downed shots of vodka at school then jumped to her death from a motorway bridge because she was 'worried about getting into trouble', an inquest heard today. Wendy Maguire, 16, left . the school grounds after being sent to the head teacher's office when staff reported smelling alcohol on her breath. Two hours after her parents were called into the school in Ilford, Wendy, who had consumed twice the legal drink drive limit, jumped off a bridge and died. Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner . Chinyere Inyama said: 'Wendy was not the type of person who would do . things on impulse. She was the kind of person who thought things . through. 'My view is that Wendy, thinking she . was going to be in trouble, in a short space of time thought things . through and decided she was going to jump off the bridge.' ‘Bright and bubbly’ Wendy downed shots before classes started on January 13 this year, it was heard today. After noticing the smell of alcohol on her breath, staff sent the 'tipsy' teenager to the headteachers office at Palmer Catholic Academy in Ilford. Wendy, who was predicted A and B GCSE grades, stormed out as Deputy head Paul Egan was on the phone to her parents asking them to pick her up. But two hours after her parents were called in, she had jumped from a footbridge in Leytonstone. School friends she had been drinking with said Wendy was crying when she came to their classroom before she left the school. Lois Blasse, 16, said: 'She told me to get rid of the drink. I think she was worried. Then she hugged me and walked off.' Terrible loss: 'Wendy was confident, popular and smart' and dreamed of becoming an accountant, according to her mother . The Palmer Catholic Academy where Wendy downed shots of alcohol before being caught and storming out of the premises . Miss Blasse, who played basketball with Wendy, texted her when she heard she was missing and asked where she was. Walthamstow Coroners Court heard Wendy . replied saying she was on a bus 'going somewhere' but when Lois told . her to go home she never got a reply and her phone was later switched . off. A student said she saw . Wendy stumbling around school at 9am and when she asked her why she was . drinking she replied: 'It’s fun.' But two hours later a witness saw her . on a bus looking upset and Wendy told her the school had found out she . had been drinking and called her parents. She was later seen standing on a footbridge looking ‘depressed and sad.’ Schoolboy Tahir Hussain, 14, who was passing by, said Wendy told him she was going to kill herself and he told her not to. Wendy's devastated family said she was 'happy and contented' and had never expressed any suicidal thoughts before . Facebook tributes: Wendy Maguire was much-loved . 'I told her to go home or go back to school. She was crying and kept saying I’m just staying on the bridge,' he said. Eyewitnesses then saw her leaning over the railings looking down into the traffic below before jumping off. A post-mortem revealed Wendy died of head injuries and was twice the legal alcohol limit at the time. The coroner said he was satisfied the school was not at fault for allowing her to leave or that it contributed to her death. He added: 'I try not to use the word tragic very much but this really is a case of a tragic death.' Speaking after the verdict Wendy’s devastated family said she was ‘happy and contented’ and had never expressed any suicidal thoughts before.

She dreamed of becoming an accountant and was looking forward to going to university. This was not a girl who would take her own life.

"By . Associated Press Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:23 EST, 28 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:49 EST, 28 November 2012 . Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite who became embroiled in the Petraeus scandal after tipping off the FBI about emails that exposed his affair, has broken her silence to demand an investigation into who leaked her name. And as she goes on the attack, officials have revealed that a team of 15 investigators are working seven days a week to scrutinise her 'potentially inappropriate' emails with General John Allen. The messages, which were uncovered . during an FBI probe into threatening emails Kelley received from . Petraeus' mistress, number in the hundreds and were sent over . two-and-a-half years, starting in 2010. Investigators have now narrowed their focus to 60 to 70 emails between Kelley and Allen, the head of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a defense official told the New York Times. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Jill Kelley, pictured with David Petraeus, has been sacked as honorary consul for South Korea . The investigation is unlikely to be . finished before the end of the year, the official said. It will look at . whether the emails fit one of three potential violations: Misconduct; . the use of government property for personal matters; or security . breaches. The massive investigation comes after Kelley fought back after . more than two weeks of silence as her attorneys released emails, . telephone recordings and other material that they say show she never . tried to exploit her friendship with Petraeus. Kelley, . through her attorneys, went on the attack against a New York . businessman who accused her of incompetence in her work trying to set up . a deal he was negotiating with South Korean companies; an attorney who . accused her of name-dropping and of being a social climber; and the FBI . agent who first leaked her name in connection with the Petraeus scandal. Kelley, . 37, became the focus of national media attention earlier this month . after it was revealed that she was the recipient of anonymous emails . from Paula Broadwell, Petraeus' biographer and mistress. Probe: Defense officials are working around the clock to scritinise emails between Kelley, pictured outside her home after the scandal broke, and Gen. John Allen, who leads U.S. troops in Afghanistan . Broadwell allegedly told Kelley she should stay away from the former general and Gen. John Allen, who had replaced Petraeus as leader of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Petraeus and Allen had become friends with Kelley and her husband, Scott Kelley, a noted cancer surgeon, when the generals served at U.S. Central Command, which is headquartered at Tampa's MacDill Air Force Base. Kelley became an unofficial social ambassador for the base, hosting numerous parties for the officers. The scandal this week cost Kelley her appointment as an honorary consul for the South Korean government, which she had gotten because of her friendship with Petraeus. The Koreans said she had misused the title in her personal business dealings. Kelley's attorneys sent a cease-and-desist letter to New York businessman Adam Victor; a complaint to the Florida bar against Tampa attorney Barry Cohen, and a letter to the U.S. Attorney's Office demanding that it investigate to find out who in the FBI leaked her name to the news media. Representatives of attorney Abbe Lowell emailed copies of the letters to The Associated Press. Friends: Petraeus kisses Kelley after accepting community service award at her home in the summer of 2011 . Proud: Kelley boasted of her $2,500-a-year position on several different car licence plates . In one of the letters, Lowell asks W. Stephen Muldrow, the assistant U.S. Attorney in Tampa, why Jill and . Scott Kelley's names were released in the course of the FBI's . investigation of Petraeus and Broadwell. Lowell said federal privacy . laws could be applicable to the couple's information. 'As you know, there are several rules and laws that seek to protect United States citizens against such leaks,' Lowell wrote. He also wanted to know whether the U.S. Attorney's Office was investigating the source of the leaks. 'You no doubt have seen the tremendous attention that the Kelleys have received in the media,' wrote Lowell. 'All they did to receive this attention was to let law enforcement know that they had been the subjects of inappropriate and potentially threatening behavior by someone else.' Another letter spoke of a business deal that Kelley tried to broker with South Korea. Kelley met Victor in late August at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, where they discussed having Kelley represent Victor's company on a coal-gasification deal being negotiated with South Korean companies. Party planner: Kelley, pictured with Petraeus and his wife Holly, received the award in March last year for 'building positive relationships between the military and the Tampa community' On August 30, according to the . documents provided by Lowell's office, Victor sent Kelley an email . saying his company was seeking bids from four major Korean firms - . Samsung, Hyundai, GS and GK - and that he expected the bidding to . potentially reach $3 billion. Award: Petraus presented the silver 'Outstanding Public Service' medal from the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Kelley reportedly requested $80million for helping with the deal. There are several back-and-forth . emails through mid-September as Victor and Kelley tried to negotiate a . fee for her work, with Kelley saying she was seeking 2 percent of the . deal and Victor trying to clarify what she meant. There were no other emails until Victor sent one November 9, when Kelley's name surfaced in the Petraeus scandal. He wrote two more times after that before she responded. When she finally did, he sent back another email in which he remarked, 'When I heard about Petraeus, I thought of you.' In a follow-up email, he asked if she was still in a position to help with Korea. She didn't respond. In a November 14 interview with the AP, Victor said it had become clear that Kelley was not a skilled negotiator and that he had wasted his time dealing with her. In a letter released Tuesday and dated November 21, Lowell accused Victor of seeking his '15 minutes of fame' by talking to the news media about his client. Lowell said Victor had defamed Kelley with his clients and misstated her desire for 2 percent of the profits by saying she wanted 2 percent of the entire deal. Lowell also accused Victor of unspecified inappropriate behavior toward Kelley. Close: Kelley is pictured with (from left) her sister Natalie Khawam, Petraeus, her husband Scott and Holly Petraeus. The award thanked her for helping Petraeus settle into his role in Tampa . Socialites: A grand painted portrait of Scott and Jill Kelley hangs in their Tampa, Florida home . Party house: The couple hosted welcome parties and award ceremonies at their $1.3 million home . 'If you want to continue seeking . publicity for yourself, that is one thing,' Lowell wrote to Victor. 'However, if you do that by maligning a person, that is something else.' He then accused Victor of casting Kelley in a false light and suggested . his attorney contact Lowell to discuss the matter. Victor . told the AP late Tuesday that he never accused Kelley of wrongdoing, . only that she was naive and not an experienced negotiator. He also said . his female assistant was present every time he met with Kelley. 'It's not a crime to be a novice,' Victor said. 'I don't know why they are talking to me.' The third letter was sent from Kelley's attorney Tuesday to the Attorney Consumer Assistance Program, which handles complaints about lawyers on behalf of the Florida Bar. In that letter, Lowell accused Cohen of breaking attorney-client privilege by publicly speaking about conversations he had with Kelley in 2009 while representing her in a dispute she had with a tenant. In those conversations, Lowell said, they discussed her friendships with various military personnel. Implicated: After Kelley told the FBI about threatening emails from Petraeus' mistress, a probe found her 'flirtatious' emails with Gen. John Allen, pictured right with Petraeus, Leon Panetta and Obama . Affair: Kelley's tip to the FBI exposed his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, and led to his resignation . Kelley's sister, Natalie Khawam, once . worked as an attorney in Cohen's firm and later sued him for sexual . harassment and breach of contract. In court responses, Cohen said Khawam . 'has a judicially documented recent history and continuing propensity . for the commission of perjury.' Cohen . said Tuesday evening that he had not seen Lowell's complaint letter and . that Kelley had 'lost the battle in the court of public opinion.' 'No matter how many high-priced lawyers and publicists she employs, she has been exposed for what she is,' he said. Prior . to Tuesday, Kelley, her attorney and her publicist had only publicly . addressed the situation once, in a statement to the news media when the . scandal first broke.","Tampa socialite who tipped off FBI about Petraeus' affair breaks her silence .

Police today confirmed they are looking into the alleged abuse following a complaint within hours after the game had finished.

Many have been annoyed by the amount of nuisance texts promising payment protection insurance refunds . A marketing company that sent millions of illegal texts encouraging Britons to claim compensation for PPI or accidents has become the first to be fined. The Information Commissioner’s Office has ordered the owners of Tetrus Telecoms to pay £440,000 after they plagued the public with up to 900,000 unlawful spam texts per day over three years. Owners Christopher Niebel and Gary McNeish were making up to £7,000 a day from selling the details of those who replied to other companies. Other firms sending similar texts or phone messages have been warned they may be next as the ICO is receiving tens of thousands of complaints from the public. Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, said: 'The public have . told us that they are distressed and annoyed by the constant bombardment . of illegal texts and calls and we are currently cracking down on the . companies responsible, using the full force of the law. 'The two individuals we have served penalties on today made a . substantial profit from the sale of personal information. They knew they . were breaking the law. 'Our message to the public is that if you don’t know who sent you a text . message then do not respond, otherwise your details may be used to . generate profits for these unscrupulous individuals.' Examples of the text messages sent out by Tetrus Telecoms included: 'CLAIM TODAY you may be entitled to £3500 for the accident you had. To . claim free, reply CLAIM to this message. To opt out text STOP. Thank . you'. Another was: 'URGENT! If you took out a Bank Loan prior to 2007 then you . are almost certainly entitled to £2300 in compensation. To claim reply . ‘YES’.' The monster fine came following an 18-month investigation into the activities of Tetrus Telecoms. Money-maker: These companies bombard people with texts and those who reply they then try to extract personal information that can help them make huge profits . The company was sending huge volumes of unsolicited text messages from offices in Stockport and Birmingham, without the consent of the recipient and without identifying the sender - both of which are legal requirements. Any replies were then used to generate leads that were sold to other companies at a considerable profit. The ICO’s investigation included raids at the company’s Stockport premises, in August 2011, and the Manchester home of Niebel, in February this year. Phone owners should also not receive unwanted automated calls - but many companies flout the law and ring them anyway - much to the anger of many . The evidence obtained showed Tetrus was using unregistered pay as you go sim cards to send out as many as 840,000 illegal text messages a day with an income of £7,000 - £8,000 a day. Niebel has now been ordered to pay a penalty of £300,000, while McNeish, who appears to have taken less out of the business, has been fined £140,000. The ICO has connected the company to over 400 complaints to its office about spam texts linked to Tetrus. If you receive a text from a company . you know, or from an anonymous five digit short code, you can prevent . any repeat by replying with the word 'STOP'. If the text message is from an . unknown company, or from an organisation you are not familiar with, the . telecoms watchdog OFCOM recommends that you do not reply. Responding will confirm that the number is active and might result in more messages, or even voice calls. Instead, you should report the text . to your network operator, which may be able to prevent further messages . from the originating number. If the texts continue, complain to . the Information Commissioner's Office – . http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints.aspx or 0303 123 1113. To stop unwanted sales calls, . register your phone number – either landline or mobile – with the . Telephone Preference Service on its website  http://www.tpsonline.org.uk . or 0845 070 0707. This service is free and takes some 28 days for the ban to come into effect. Alternatively, some telephone . companies offer services to block unwanted calls. For example, BT offers .

Medical examiners found that a mother killed her two sons with the help of a sleep medication before hanging herself in their Florida home. Dawn Brown is thought to have drowned her sons, ages 5 and 9, just hours after her husband said he was leaving her.

Friend and neighbor William Lavold told Tampa Bay Online that Mr Brown, 36, was distraught. He said: 'He can't function. He can't figure it out. He's done in. He's really done in.'

A neighbor of the family, Nichole Bell, told the paper that the two brothers attended McMullen-Booth Elementary School with her son, who was one of Zander’s best friends. 'I can't believe it. She was so interested in her kids' educations,' Ms Bell said. Bell told the paper that her son and Zander got in a fight at the bus stop on Friday morning and had to go to a guidance counselor when they arrived at school.

"By . Talal Musa . PUBLISHED: . 11:22 EST, 20 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:37 EST, 20 November 2012 . To celebrate the release of LEGO The Lord of the Rings, MailOnline talked to the game's Executive Producer, Nick Ricks, on what it takes to build their most epic game yet. 1. What made you want to take on The Lord of the Rings? Nick: 'We have always have been passionate about bringing incredible stories to a younger audience, and few tales fit the bill more so than The Lord of the Rings. 'The opportunity to re-create Middle-earth, with its vast array of heroic characters, stunning locations and menacing villains, has been something we’ve discussed for a long time. Happy family: Expect to meet all of the characters on your journey around Middle-earth. 'However, we were conscious that to do justice to these well-loved tales would be an incredible challenge. It’s only now that our tools and technology have advanced sufficiently to enable us to create a LEGO Middle-earth that meets everyone’s expectations (including ours).' 2. Is this your most ambitious LEGO project  yet? Nick: 'Without a doubt. The game comprises of eighteen levels, covering the major sections of all three films; from the battle on the slopes of Mount Doom, through to epic recreations of Helm’s Deep, Shelob’s Lair and many more.' 'Additionally, there are more than eighty characters to find and collect, so in these aspects alone we already have a LEGO game of unrivalled scope. 'However, on top of this, the players will be able to explore all of LEGO Middle-earth, where dozens of side-quests can be unlocked and LEGO Mithril bricks can be found and forged into new magical items. All in all it adds up to the biggest game we’ve ever created.' 3.Talk me through the development process. Have you used the books as inspiration, too? Nick: 'The first thing we do whenever a new game is started is to understand what elements are unique about the property. 'What makes The Lord of the Rings different from say Batman or Harry Potter...? For us the core of the Lord of the Rings story is a sense of a quest or journey: both a physical journey; from Hobbiton to Mordor, and an emotional one; with the characters fulfilling their destinies. Once established we attempt to distil these elements into game-play. Pixel perfect: Gandulf is instantly recognisable, and audio is taken directly from the movies. 'The sense of a physical journey has been captured in the creation of LEGO Middle-earth itself. By basing the gameplay in an open world, the player really does need to embark on this journey, having to travel to key locations (such as Weathertop of Edoras) where they can engage in “traditional” action-adventure levels. 'This way the journey, encompassing all of the astounding locations and intricate side-quests, truly becomes an integral part of the gamers’ experience. 'The sense of the emotional journey is encompassed in the new “Treasure Trove” feature. As the characters continue on their quest, so they grow and realise their full potential. 'Sam and Frodo begin as meek and mild Hobbits, but end up with the nobility of Middle-earth bowing down to them, or Strider the Ranger must confront his destiny and become Aragorn the King. 'To emulate this we reward the player’s progression with new powers and abilities that are accessed through the Treasure Trove. 'So, for example, Legolas is gifted the Bow of the Galadhrim, Frodo gains the Light of Elendil. These amazing magical items grant new powers and abilities to the player’s characters, emulating the progression they take in the fiction. 'Once these foundations have been set, so the corresponding game mechanics can be prototyped and implemented, alongside the crafting of the levels and environments through which the characters will travel. 'Part of this process is reviewing both the theatrical and written fiction for sources of further inspiration, so fans of the books will notice references that were not included in the films.' 4. What has been the biggest challenge so far? Nick: 'Amongst the many significant challenges we’ve faced making LEGO The Lord of the Rings the greatest has been the realisation of the Middle-earth itself. 'The creation of a seamlessly streaming open world was vital to capture the sense of the epic journey, which we identified as being at the heart of the story. 'The player begins their quest in Hobbiton and from here, the snow-capped peaks of the Misty Mountains can be seen, and players know that they can journey to there without interruption. Watch your step: Legolas traverses a snowy peak. Environments are a mixture of organic and LEGO materials. 'Once across the mountains and into the lands of the Rohirrim so Edoras, Isengard and even the glowering Eye of Sauron, endlessly gazing out atop Barad-dûr, can be seen and reached. 'This provides a sense of immersion unparalleled in a LEGO game, and justifies the tremendous investment gone into its creation.' 5. The graphics are stunning. How have you achieved this with the aging consoles? Nick: 'I’m delighted that you think so; we’re all very proud of what we’ve created. Naturally, with the award-winning production design of the movies as basis, we had a terrific head start. 'But, whilst locations such as Weathertop or Minas Tirith are recognisable from the films, there are hundreds of other locations that the team have had to conceptualise and build from scratch. 'Here their commitment and dedication has come to the fore, to ensure that all of LEGO Middle-earth looks as fantastic and vibrant as people would expect. 'One advantage that the current generation of consoles does offer is that the hardware is very familiar to us. 'As such the team are able to squeeze every last drop of processing power to ensure that the lighting, environments, audio (to name just a few) are as stunning as you’ve already noted.' 6. Any news on downloadable content? Nick: 'With a story of this scale, with such a diverse collection of heroes and villains, there were some that we could not fit into the main game. 'Characters like Smeagol, Corsairs of Umbar and many others from the films are available as DLC, as are others taken from the written fiction, such as Prince Imrahil, the Barrow-wight and Glorfindel. My precious: A frustrated-looking Gollum takes some time out in the marshes. 'Additionally, we’re also able to offer some characters that are unique to a LEGO Middle-earth, so we have a Mini-Balrog or Sauron in his fair '2nd Age' guise. 'Moreover with the “Treasure Trove” feature, the team have also been to create a DLC pack of weapons and magical items that are both devastating and humorous in equal measure. 7. Does the soundtrack stay true to the films? Nick: 'Indeed. One of our ambitions was to re-create the cinematic feel of the movies – after all this is the first time we’ve adapted an Academy Award winning film in LEGO form! 'As such, the inclusion of Howard Shore’s score is essential in transporting the player to Middle-earth right from the very first screen. 'On top of that we’ve also included the actual theatrical dialogue, voiced by the original actors, and had it spoken through the mouths of the LEGO mini-figs. 'We pondered long and hard over this decision, as in most of our previous games the characters have mimed or used simple grunts. But as soon as we trialled it what were immediately convinced of its efficacy. 'Having such world-renowned actors like Sirs Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee delivering their lines greatly increase the drama, as well as providing the story’s narrative in clear and concise fashion. 'However, in no way does this detract from the charm and irreverence normally associated with our games, in fact it has provided a whole new medium for LEGO humour.' 8. What have you done to expand areas only hinted on in the movies? Nick: One of the many successes of Peter Jackson’s adaptations was his ability to conjure up the agelessness of the world. 'In the written fiction, even the Sun and the Moon are relatively new to Middle-earth, and for millennia races and civilisations have risen and fallen. 'We strived to re-create this timeless quality into the game as well. As the player explores all of the secrets of Middle-earth, so they’ll discover ancient castles long abandoned, hidden caves and ruined dungeons. Fierce: Orks are your main foes, but along your quest, you'll encounter other beasts, too. 'We were eager to bring this timeless quality across in the game, as we know older gamers will appreciate the depth it brings, and younger gamers will be introduced to it for the first time. 'I hope it will spark their interest in The Lord of the Rings, and inspire them to read the novels and watch the films as they grow older. 'It’s an immense privilege, and great responsibility, to introduce this world to a younger audience. and, if they do go on and enjoy the broader fiction, the LEGO games and toys will have framed their experience, and introduced them to the story in a familiar and fun way.'

A father helped his son and two friends kidnap a 13-year-old boy and bundle him into his car boot during 'a stupid prank that went very wrong'. The trio of 14-year-olds wore balaclavas and even put on a fake accent to scare the victim during the bizarre incident in Torquay, Devon, last year. A court heard how the young victim had been walking along a street when a black car suddenly pulled up and three older boys got out wearing balaclavas which they had picked up from an earlier go karting party. Terrifying: The 13-year-old victim told a youth court he 'thought he was going to die' during the prank by three older boys wearing balaclavas (file picture) and one of their fathers . With one speaking in a Liverpudlian accent, they forced him into the boot before the father drove off. A short time later the teenagers uncovered their faces and let the victim out. He told South Devon Youth Court: 'I really did not know what was happening. I thought I was going to die.' He added that he thought it was like something ‘from a movie’. When he realised who the boys were he told his own father and the family contacted police. Two of the boys were charged with kidnapping and faced prison before the Crown Prosecution Service eventually agreed to reduce it to common assault. But the remaining offender and his father, who were both American and believed to be the ringleaders of the stunt, moved out of Torquay and returned to the US before charges could be brought. None of the boys or the adult can be identified for legal reasons. Legal representatives for the defendants said the group had been driving along the road when they thought it would be ‘a good idea to play a prank’ on the 13-year-old - but that no malice had been intended. Solicitor Alasdair James, representing one of the boys, said it was 'a prank which had gone very wrong'. Bizarre: The victim had been walking down a street in Torquay, Devon, when a car suddenly pulled up and the trio got out wearing balaclavas . He said the American boy's father had an ‘over indulgent relationship with his son and friends’. Lawyer Paul Dentith, for the other defendant, said it was a ‘stupid plan hatched quickly'. He said: 'It beggars belief that an adult in the car drove it off, he should not have stopped the car in the first place. It was a completely inappropriate prank which went so wrong.' The boys, both from Torquay, Devon, both admitted assault. Prosecutor Chris Bittlestone said the victim’s mother, who ‘occupied a responsible position in society’, had . built bridges with the defendants’ families and agreed that the charges . could be reduced to common assault. Sitting with their parents, one told the magistrates: 'It was a stupid idea.' The other said: 'It was a stupid idea - a good joke at the time.' The pair were warned they could have been jailed if the original kidnapping charges had been pursued. Both boys were given a six month referral order and told to pay £50 each to the victim and £45 costs each.","Terrified victim bundled into boot of the car by trio wearing balaclavas .

The teen cousins who were shot and killed during an alleged home burglary on Thanksgiving Day have been tied to a similar break-in a day earlier, authorities said. Before the burglary was discovered, deputies were called to the neighborhood because a red Mitsubishi Eclipse was spotted in the driveway of a home owned by Richard L. Johnson, Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel said. Nicholas Brady, 17, had been driving that car, although it wasn't registered to him. Deputies questioned him, but then let him go, Wetzel said. Scroll down for video . Killed: The bodies of cousins Haile Kifer, 18, left, and Nicholas Brady, 17, right, were found stashed in the . basement of a man who claimed the teens broke into his home on . Thanksgiving . A day later, Byron Smith shot and killed Brady and Brady's 18-year-old cousin, Haile Kifer, in the basement of his Little Falls home. Smith told authorities that he disturbed the pair as they tried to break into his house and that he shot them in self-defense. The same red Mitsubishi Eclipse was discovered Friday parked around the corner from Smith's property. In custody: Byron Smith was arrested after admitting to police he had killed the teens a day earlier . 'There are some preliminary indications that the Johnson burglary may have been committed by the Brady boy and the Kifer girl, but it's too early now to say definitively,' Wetzel said, adding that more information could be made available later today. The Minneapolis StarTribune reported that Johnson, a retired high school teacher, had been in Spain and did not know his home had been burglarized until he returned to the home on Sunday. Johnson told the paper that he reported several items stolen from his house, including less than $5 in pennies kept in a box on his dresser, silver and copper coins, and some prescription medication, including drugs for diabetes and controlling cholesterol. Wetzel couldn't immediately say whether any of those missing items were found in Brady's car. In addition, Johnson reported a sliding glass door that had been broken. 'I do know they found quite a bit of evidence in their vehicle that was parked near the Smith place,' the sheriff said late Tuesday. 'We're trying to investigate whether it might have come from the Johnson burglary.' Smith, a retired U.S. State Department employee, was charged Monday with two counts of murder. According to the criminal complaint, Smith shot the teens multiple times. He told investigators his home had been broken into several times before. Minnesota law gives homeowners the right to protect themselves and their property, but Wetzel said they don't have the right to execute an intruder once the threat is neutralized. Johnson told the Star Tribune: 'The whole thing is . very sad that they lost their lives. In the same instance, if they . hadn't been breaking into houses, they'd be alive.' Smith told authorities that he was in his basement last Thursday when he heard a window break upstairs. Another break-in? A day before they were shot to death in Byron Smith's home, a car driven by Brady was spotted in the driveway of Richard L. Johnson's home in Little Falls . When he saw Brady on the basement stairwell, he fired at the teenager then shot him again in the face after he fell down. The complaint said Smith told an investigator: 'I want him dead.' Smith said he dragged Brady's body into his workshop. When Kifer came down the stairs, he shot her multiple times. He dragged her into the room and as she gasped for air, he fired what he described as a 'good clean finishing shot' under her chin 'up into the cranium,' the complaint said. Yesterday, Smith admitted that he fired 'more shots than he needed to,' as friends and family of the dead teens expressed outrage over their deaths. On Monday, he was charged with second-degree murder and police revealed he told them he fired more shots than necessary after his gun jammed and Kifer laughed at him. While Minnesota law stipulates people are allowed to use deadly force when defending their . homes, relatives, friends, police and prosecutors claimed Smith reacted too drastically by killing them. Missed: Friends and teacher expressed their shock at deaths and described Haile as a popular role model . Joker: Friends also remembered Brady as an out-going student who loved to make people smile . 'A . person has every right to defend themselves and their homes, even . employing deadly force if necessary,' Morrison County Sheriff Michel . Wetzel said. 'Circumstances of this case however, led deputies to . believe that Smith went beyond that point.' And as he was charged on Monday, his intentions to shoot the teens dead became clear. In a criminal complaint, Smith said . he was in the basement of his home when he heard a window breaking and . footsteps. Fearful of other recent break-ins, he shot Brady when he came into view. When the teenager tumbled down the stars, Smith shot him in the face as he lay on the floor, looking up. 'I want him dead,' the complaint quoted Smith as telling an investigator. He dragged the body into his workshop . and then sat in the chair, the complaint said. When Kifer began walking . down the stairs, he shot her and she fell down the stairs. Scene: Smith's home in Little Falls, MN has been burglarized eight times in recent years, his brother said . He tried to shoot her again with his rifle, but the gun jammed and Kifer laughed at him, the complaint noted. 'If you're trying to shoot somebody and . they laugh at you, you go again,' Smith, 64, told investigators, according to a criminal complaint filed . Monday. He then shot her several times in the chest with a . .22-caliber revolver, dragged her next to her cousin, and with as she . gasped for air, fired a shot under her chin 'up into the cranium'. 'Smith described it as ""a good clean finishing shot"",' according to the . compliant, but acknowledged that he had fired 'more shots than . (he) needed to'. Smith said he left the bodies in his home overnight before calling a neighbor to ask if he knew a good lawyer. He later asked the neighbor to contact police. A prosecutor at Morrison County District Court . on Monday morning called Smith's reaction 'appalling.' Pain: Crystal Shaeffel, 27, cries after walking up the driveway of the home of Byron David Smith in Little Falls, Minnesota where her brother Nick Brady was shot and killed on Thursday . 'Mr. Smith intentionally killed two teenagers in his home in a matter . that goes well beyond self-defense,' Morrison County Attorney Brian . Middendorf said at the hearing. Friends have taken to a memorial Facebook page for Kifer and Schaeffel to vent their anger about the deaths. Others spoke out at a vigil for the youngsters on Sunday night. 'They were just really great people,' friend Rachel Stauffer, 15, told the Star Tribune. 'They . could make anyone laugh.' Carlee Davich, who coached Kifer in swimming at school, added: 'She was . always happy. She had a way that just made everyone happy. A lot of the . swimmers and divers looked up to her.' Emma Schmidt, a fellow classmate at Little Falls High School, said Kifer was talented and well-liked . and 'everyone's wondering' what she was doing in Smith's basement. Further . insight into the lives of the cousins was given by Brady's sister, . Crystal Shaeffel, as she visited Smith's home and spoke with his . brother. 'They were 17 and 18 years old, and didn't need to die,' she told Bruce Smith. Remembered: At a candle-lit vigil on Sunday, Rachel Brady speaks about her brother Nick to the crowd . 'That . all depends on your perspective,' he responded, referring to a series . of break-ins his brother had endured. In one in October, thieves stole . $10,000 worth of guns and electronics, he said. But Shaeffel insisted that her brother had no . need to turn to burglary, as he made good money working for their . father's tree-trimming business. She added that her cousin, who had undergone treatment for substance abuse, could have been after pills from the home. 'Yes, she had an addiction problem and stuff, but that doesn't mean she . deserves to get murdered at 18 years old,' Shaeffel said. 'I understand . they came there to rob them, or whatever, but shoot them in the shoulder . and call the cops.' On the Facebook page, friends agreed that the shootings were too severe. 'It doesn't matter what they . were or weren't doing there,' Mike Boulley wrote. 'They were KIDS that didn't deserve to die. Defending your property against armed burglars is one thing, gunning . down two unarmed teenagers is just inexcusable.' Support: Friends on a memorial Facebook page have asked whether the appropriate force was used . Logan Ayres added: 'It's hard to see . such nice people lose their lives to something that could of been so . easily taken care of instead of murder. R.I.P. nick and halie (sic) you will . be dearly missed.' Smith, 64, is currently being held on $2million bail.

Deadly: A leaked diagram suggests that Iranian scientists have carried out computer tests for a nuclear weapon three times as powerful as that which destroyed Hiroshima, pictured . Scientists in Iran could be producing a nuclear weapon three times as powerful as that which destroyed Hiroshima during the Second World War, according to a leaked diagram. The diagram, which suggests that experts have run computer simulations for the weapon, was released by an unnamed country which is opposed to Iran's atomic programme and wishes to boost its view that it should be brought to a halt before a weapon can be produced. The graph - which shows a bell curve with variables of time, power and energy - shows that the weapon would have a force of around 50 kilotons two microseconds after detonation. In comparison, the bomb that the United States dropped on the Japenese city of Hiroshima which killed around 140,000 people in 1945 had a force of about 15 kilotons. Modern nuclear weapons have yields hundreds of times higher than that. The International Atomic Energy Agency — the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog — reported last year that it had obtained diagrams indicating that Iran was calculating the 'nuclear explosive yield' of potential weapons but did not give details of what the diagrams showed. The diagram, obtained by news agency Associated Press, had the number five as part of its title, suggesting that it is one of a series. David Albright, whose Institute for Science and International Security is used by the U.S. government as a go-to source on Iran's nuclear program, said the diagram looks genuine but seems to be designed more 'to understand the process' than as part of a blueprint for an actual weapon in the making. He added that the power of the weapon is too big, noting that North Korea's first tests of a nuclear device were only a few kilotons. Because the graph appears to be only one in a series, others might show lower yields, closer to what a test explosion might produce, he said. The senior diplomat said the diagram was part of a series of Iranian computer-generated models provided to the IAEA by the intelligence services of member nations for use in its investigations into suspicions that Iran is trying to produce a nuclear weapon. Iran denies any interest in such a weapon and has accused the United States and Israel of fabricating evidence that suggests it is trying to build a bomb. Computer tests: The undated diagram shows a force more than three times greater than the atomic bomb which devastated the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 . Asked about the project, Iran's chief IAEA delegate, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said he had not heard of it. IAEA spokeswoman Gill Tudor said the agency had no comment. Iran has refused to halt uranium enrichment, despite offers of reactor fuel from abroad, saying it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian uses. It has refused for years to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear agency's efforts to investigate its program. Iran's critics fear it could use the enriched uranium for military purposes. Such concerns grew this month when the IAEA said Iran is poised to double its output of higher-enriched uranium at its fortified underground facility — a development that could put Tehran within months of being able to make the core of a nuclear warhead. In reporting on the existence of the diagrams last year, the IAEA said it had obtained them from two member nations that it did not identify. Other diplomats have said that Israel and the United States — the countries most concerned about Iran's nuclear program — have supplied the bulk of intelligence being used by the IAEA in its investigation. 'The application of such studies to anything other than a nuclear explosive is unclear to the agency,' the IAEA said at the time. Devastation: Some 140,000 people died when the US dropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima in 1945 . The models were allegedly created in 2008 and 2009 — well after 2003, the year that the United States said Tehran had suspended such work in any meaningful way. That date has been questioned by Britain, France, Germany and Israel, and the IAEA now believes that — while Iran shut down some of its work back then — other tests and experiments continue today. With both the IAEA probe and international attempts to engage Iran stalled, there are fears that Israel may opt to strike at Tehran's nuclear program. The Jewish state insists it will not tolerate an Iran armed with nuclear arms. An intelligence summary provided with the drawing linked it to other alleged nuclear weapons work — significant because it would indicate that Iran is working not on isolated experiments, but rather on a single program aimed at mastering all aspects of nuclear arms development. Nuclear: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad watches from a control room as nuclear fuel rods are loaded into a research reactor in Tehran earlier this year. The country says it is producing nuclear energy for civilian use . The IAEA suspects that Iran has conducted live tests of conventional explosives that could be used to detonate a nuclear weapon at Parchin, a sprawling military base southeast of Tehran. An intelligence summary said data gained from those tests fed the model plotted in the diagram. Iran has repeatedly turned down IAEA requests to visit the site, which the agency fears is undergoing a major cleanup meant to eliminate any traces of such experiments. Meanwhile, a new satellite picture shows that activity at a missile launch site in North Korea has stepped up a gear, suggesting that long range ballistic missiles could be tested in the next few weeks. The image, which shows the Sohae Satellite Launch Station, was released by satellite operator DigitalGlobe Inc days after Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun claimed that US intelligence were aware of moves seen as preparation by North Korea to launch a long range missile as early as this month. It shows more tents, people, equipment and trucks at the site, similar to when preparations were being made for a failed rocket launch back in April. Ready to launch: A satellite image shows increased activity at a missile launch site in North Korea, suggesting that the country will test long range ballistic missiles in the coming weeks . A Pentagon spokeswoman declined to comment on the reported satellite images, but said the Defense Department's position on North Korea's missile development efforts had not changed. She urged North Korea to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions that 'require Pyongyang to suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner, and re-establish its moratorium on missile launching.' The country, which carried out nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and is under heavy U.N. sanctions for its atomic weapons program, has tried for years to influence major events in South Korea by waging propaganda or armed attacks. North and South Korea have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, and regional powers have for years been trying to rein in the North's nuclear program. North Korea is believed to be developing a long-range ballistic missile with a range of up to 4,200 miles aimed at hitting the continental United States but the last two rocket test launches failed. In April, under its new leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea launched a rocket that flew just a few minutes covering a little over 60 miles before crashing into the sea between South Korea and China.","A leaked diagram suggests that Iranian scientists have run computer simulations for a weapon .

Her son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is appearing at court, charged with her murder . A 16-year-old boy murdered his mother by stabbing her 94 times, immobilising her early on in the attack by severing her spinal cord, a court heard today. The teenager, who admits having 'an . interest in knives', then claimed Leah Whittle had been killed at their home in Weymouth, Dorset, by a gang of 'mystery men from Yorkshire'. He inflicted knife wounds across her head, back and front in the two bedroom flat, stabbing her with at . least one knife in an attack so sudden she had 'little chance' to defend . herself, jurors were told. The teenager then fled the flat in the early hours, climbing out of . his first floor bedroom window and down a drainpipe. He . went to visit friends, feeding them an elaborate cover story that he . had seen a gang of 'mystery men' from the north of England kill his mother, . Winchester Crown Court heard. Divorced mother-of-three Ms Whittle, 42, was found slumped against the hallway wall. Prosecutor . Richard Smith said the teenager claimed he had watched through a . bathroom doorway as other people stabbed his mother to death. Mr . Smith said: 'He described to friends how he had gone into the bathroom . and from there was alerted by a noise to something happening outside. 'The implication is that men had entered the flat and were trying to kill his own mother about a foot away from him. 'He said he watched through the ajar . door of the bathroom as ""they"" were stabbing his mother. And at some . stage ""they"" tried to knife him.' The . youngster told friends of his 'escape' when he met up with them shortly . before 3am, Mr Smith said. They did not call the police or an . ambulance. In an earlier . phone call, at around 10pm that evening, the boy had told a female . friend in that group his mother would be executed and had 'days to . live', Mr Smith said. Mr Smith said: 'His brother had got himself into some sort of trouble with a drug debt or the like. 'The . boy announced that his mum had only got a couple of days to live. The . friend was left with the impression that his mum's life was at immediate . risk. 'Interest in knives': Winchester Crown Court heard the teenager turned on his mother, stabbing her in the head, back and front and then blaming mystery men from Yorkshire . 'Mystery people somehow concerned with his brother up in Doncaster were on their way or in someway likely to kill Ms Whittle.' Tragically, the friend - who cannot be . named for legal reasons - could hear Ms Whittle in the background, . bringing her son a drink. Mr . Smith added: 'Was he already in some sort of murderous mindset by this . point? Had he intended to take his own mother's life and this gave him . the welcome opportunity of a cover story? 'Exactly why it was that the defendant . decided upon such a dreadful and genuinely tragic course of events . perhaps will never be known.' Prosecutor Richard Smith . 'Or having spoken with a teenage bravado, did something later on trigger his temper?' Either way, Ms Whittle was 'immobilised' early on in an horrific killing at his hands, Mr Smith said. A blade wielded by her son severed her spinal cord, a post mortem of her bloodstained body revealed. There were no injuries on her arms or hands, suggesting she was rendered unconscious early in the attack. Today, the boy, now 17, wore a silver tracksuit as he listened to his mother's last moments being relived in court. Mr Smith added: 'Exactly why it was that the defendant decided upon such a dreadful and genuinely tragic course of events perhaps will never be known. 'It may well be that during the course of that night he had become angry at something she had said or done. He says for himself that he has a temper and perhaps that and his interest in knives came together and he took his mother's life.' Mr Smith told the jury that the youngster should have called 999 or screamed for help, or called an ambulance, but he did nothing but leave the flat. He eventually went to a friend's house with his mother's blood on his face and on his socks, the court heard. In the boy's version of events, he must have stepped over his mother's motionless body to lock the door after her killers left. Then he took money from her handbag, changed his trousers and left through the window. He told his three friends - all girls - that cuts on his hands were from scaling down the drainpipe. But forensics experts found traces of his blood inside the flat. The murder weapons have never been recovered. The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies one charge of murder between July 19 and 21. The trial continues.

Have your fill: Pizza Hut's Facebook page says 'Go all in with six jumbo slices loaded with pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese, sealed between two golden crusts' All in: Pizza Hut's website encourages its patrons to go 'all in' on pizza night for $12.99 . As the Huffington Post noted, the stuffed crust pizza became one of Pizza Hut’s best sellers, and the chain has since been introducing seemingly endless variations of the formula. Hot-dog-stuffed crusts. Cone crusts. Adding to the fray, Pizza Hut has introduced what is best described as a cross between a deep-dish pizza and a calzone. The restaurant writes on its Facebook page: ‘Go all in with six jumbo slices loaded with pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese, sealed between two golden crusts.’ It is offered as either an Italian Meat Trio, or a Supremo, which comes with sausage, onions, peppers, and mushrooms. Both are sold for $12.99. Nutrition information was not available on the company’s website, but a single slice of a medium stuffed-crust pan pizza comes in at 340 calories, making the whole eight slices 2,720 calories. A representative did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for nutritional information. Users on Twitter were quick to react to news of the pizza. One user, giorgiotedx, wrote: ‘Less is more, especially when it comes to pizza.’ Another user, NevineZaki, wrote: ‘OfferStuffed arteries anyone?’ Popular: Pizza Hut, owned by Yum Foods Inc., has more than 7,200 locations throughout the U.S. But not all tweets were negative.

Pizza Hut has more than 7,200 restaurants across the U.S. The parent company recently introduced a new line of sweet snacks for its Mexican fast food chain, Taco Bell, expanding its dessert menu to include churros and cookie sandwiches to its current lineup of cinnamon twists and caramel apple empanadas. Attracting customers to restaurants during between-meal hours has become a critical way to drive sales, as chains have to pay for fixed costs like electricity and labor anyways. Inspiration?

'The Wall Street investors who took over the company after the last bankruptcy attempted to resolve the mess by attacking the company’s most valuable asset – its workers.' Hostess has said that production at about a dozen of its 33 plants has been seriously affected by the strike. Three plants were closed earlier this week. The company, founded in 1930, was fighting battles beyond labor costs. Competition is increasing in the snack space and Americans are becoming more conscious about healthy eating. The quintessential junk food treat - a cream-filled, 150-calorie sponge cake - has been called the ""cream puff of the proletariat"" and the ""snack with a snack in the middle."" It faces extinction now that its maker, Hostess Brands, announced plans to liquidate amid a dispute with striking bakers.* James A. Dewar, a manager for the Continental Baking Co, came up with the idea in 1930 after seeing the machines that made shortcakes with strawberry filling sit idle at the bakery when strawberries were out of season. He injected the elongated sponge cake with banana filling - vanilla would be used later - and called it a Twinkie after seeing a billboard for the Twinkle Toe Shoe Company. Dewar, who died in 1985 at age 88, said he ate at least two packets of Twinkies a week.* Twinkies were scorned by nutritionists as the archetypal unhealthy snack and became a comic's punch line, but somebody is eating them. Hostess was able to manufacture 1,000 a minute at its bakeries and in 2005 the Washington Post said Americans had bought $47 million worth of Twinkies in the previous year.* Many jokes about Twinkies play off their longevity thanks to their ample chemical preservatives. There has been much speculation about how many decades a Twinkie can sit on a shelf before being eaten. For the sake of freshness, Theresa Cogswell of the Twinkies' parent company Hostess, has said that no more than 25 days was ideal but a Maine college professor gained notoriety by keeping one atop his blackboard for 30 years. He said it still looked good.* In 2000 President Bill Clinton's White House Millennium Council put together a time capsule in order to give people in 2100 an idea of how we lived. Its contents included historic items such as a piece of the Berlin Wall, film of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon, a U.S. World War Two soldier's helmet, a photo of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and a Twinkie.* The trial of San Francisco city supervisor Dan White, who fatally shot the mayor and another supervisor in 1978, gave rise to what came to be known as the ""Twinkie defense."" The defense said White was suffering mental problems, as evidenced by the way he had given up his healthy lifestyle and started eating junk food. The defense argued that this behavior was an indication of his instability. White ended up serving five years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.* Twinkies' surge in popularity in the 1950s was partially attributed to its ads on ""The Howdy Doody Show"" directed at kids, who demanded the desserts in their lunch boxes.* Hostess collected recipes from connoisseurs to publish the ""The Twinkies Cookbook"" in 2006. The 50 recipes included Twinkie-based burritos, lasagna, tiramisu, milkshakes and sushi (with dried fruit rather than fish). Deep-fried Twinkies have been a staple at U.S. state fairs.* The Twinkie has a long list of television and movie credits. Archie Bunker always had one in his lunch on the sitcom ""All in the Family"" and they have been featured in the animated series ""Family Guy"" and ""The Simpsons."" A character in ""The Deer Hunter"" eats Twinkies dipped in mustard. In the wacky comedy ""Ghostbusters"" a scientist tracking demons calculates that the level of ""psychokinetic energy"" in New York City could normally be as big as a Twinkie but things had become so bad that that Twinkie would now be 35 feet long and weigh 600 pounds (about 270 kg).* Twinkies are just part of the Hostess snack food family. Other well-known treats from the company include Ding Dongs, Ho Hos, Suzy Q's, Sno Balls, Zingers and Drake's cakes.* Twitter and other social media were filled with laments about a Twinkie-less world on Friday. Entrepreneurs and speculators turned to eBay. A box of 10 Twinkies was being offered on the online auction site for a starting bid of $500. ""What better way to say, 'I love you' than with the gift of an American icon that will be gone soon,"" the seller said.","Hostess is closing its 33 plants, laying off its 18,500 workers and putting its snack brands up for sale .

You'll be pleased to hear that you won't need to do any exercise to work off that fizzy drink.  However, according to a newly launched exercise calculator you'll need to go for a half-hour brisk walk if you want to work off the calories from a standard 330ml can. The Work It Out Calculator has been launched by the Coca-Cola company and matches all of its popular drinks with how long it would take to burn the calories off through various forms of exercise. So while a 144 calorie can of Sprite could be worked off in an 18 minute Zumba class, it would take 47 minutes of ballroom dancing, or - if you could face it - 73 minutes of ironing. Helpful advice or cynical PR ploy? The Coca-Cola calculator lists calories but not the sugar content of each drink . It reveals that 'healthier' vitamin drinks such as Glaceau Vitamin Water Essential would still require a 13minute cycle ride or vacuuming for 19 minutes. But if household chores fill you with . dread, Coca-Cola reminds readers that: 'Great music can put the fun . into vacuuming. Crank up a fast-paced tune and burn some calories while . you clean!' The . calculator also doesn't mention just how much sugar is in it's 'full-fat . products'. A can of coke contains 39g or nine teaspoons of sugar, which . is close to half of a woman's recommended daily allowance of 90g. A can of Diet Coke contains 0.5 calories so doesn't require exercise to work off, however normal Coca-Cola is a different matter (see table above right) The company launched the calculator after it commissioned a survey that revealed over a third of Britons admit they don't have the time to be as active as they like, with motivation (32 per cent) cited as a key barrier. Coca-Cola GB said: 'We want to help . people understand how they can enjoy our drinks as part of a healthful . balanced diet, whilst communicating the importance of an active . lifestyle.' The move will be seen by many as a cynical PR stunt to promote Coca-Cola as a healthy-brand. However, many will doubtless be keen to learn how much jogging they need to do tonight after downing a can of Fanta (12 minutes, in case you're wondering). The company has faced criticism in the past for not responding to health concerns. In June, UK campaigners called for a ban on a colouring linked to cancer which has been found in Coca-Cola sold in Britain. Glaceau Vitamin Water can be worked off doing chores . Coca-Cola . has recently switched to a new manufacturing process in America to . bring down the level of the chemical, 4-methylimidazole (4-MI), which gives coke its distinctive colour.

Irritates not informs: Hidden inside a Christmas card, a round robin letter does more to irritate the recipient rather than inform .

Neighbours have told how they comforted a dying teen as she and her best friend lay dying on the street after being riddled with bullets. Bobbie Sartain, 16, and Raquel Gerstel,15, were shot to death early Sunday morning and found on opposite sides of an Oakland road by horrified neighbours, bloody and riddled with bullets. Resident Monique Jefferson said she held Sartain's hands and told her: 'Stay with me angel, you're safe now' before the 16-year-old died. It came as the devastated mother of a teen gunned . down alongside her best friend on a California street said she had no . idea why the two girls were targeted. Distraught, Bambi Sartain begged for witnesses to come forward to help piece together the shocking tragedy, which saw her lose her 'beautiful girl.' Fast friends: Bobbie Sartain and Raquel Gerstel had grown up together until they met their tragically early deaths . 'I don't know why someone would do this to my daughter,' she told the Mercury News. 'She had no money, no nothing. She was just a baby.' 'Anyone who knows of any witnesses, please come forward, even anonymously. I beg of you. I would do anything to get closure.' The girls, who had been inseparable for years, had turned up at the mobile home of Bobbie's relative Chuck Briggs in the pre-dawn hours of Sunday. Mr Briggs told them to go to sleep after Raquel began arguing with someone on her cell phone, according to Mercury News. 'They mouthed off a little,' Bambi . Sartain told the newspaper. 'Her uncle told her to leave, and Raquel . wanted to leave and Bobbie went with her. 'They were best friends. She'd . do anything out of loyalty.' Tragic: Raquel Gerstel, pictured left with a different friend, was still alive when neighbours rushed to her aide . The pair reportedly walked to nearby Union 76 gas station on High Street just before 5am. 'They didn't say where they (had been) or where they were going' Ms Sartain said. The . teens were found about an hour later having been shot nearly 40 times. Neighbours who heard the gunshots ran outside and sat with the girls, . holding their hands until help arrived. Jayne Nayman said the barrage of bullets woke her up and her son, Jed Hamilton, 36, rushed out to Bobbie and Raquel's aide. One of the girls was still alive, Nayman told the Mercury News. 'My son held her hand. 'I was afraid to go outside, but my son, he's fearless.' Police arrived within 90 seconds, she said, after which her son ran back to their home, crying. Raquel Gerstel: The 15-year-old was found 'full of bullets' by local resident Monique Jefferson, who told her: 'Stay with me angel. You¿re safe now' 'He said, ""Don't go out there mom. Stay inside. The blood. It's bad.""' Resident Monique Jefferson also ran out after spotting the girls on the pavement. '(Gerstel) was full of bullets,' she told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'I kept . telling her, 'Stay with me angel. You’re safe now.'"" But both teenagers soon succumbed to their injuries and were pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Ms Sartain said her daughter was an aspiring veterinarian. 'She was a good girl and she got caught up with something she shouldn't have been involved in,' she said. 'She was a teenager and kind of unruly, but I thought there was more time.' 'She had a bright future. I'll never be able to get over (her death) in my lifetime. She was my heart.' Bobbie Sartain: The 16-year-old had had an argument with her mother's boyfriend on the night she was murdered . Raquel's father, Barton Gerstel, said that he was crushed by his daughter’s death. 'She's going to be missed. I love her and my heart is torn,' he told the Chronicle. Friends and family members had put together memorials on the street on Wednesday for the two girls with roses, candles and teddy bears. An anonymous note read, 'Sweetheart: Though I did not know you before, I felt great love for you as you were going somewhere else. I promise I will do everything in my power to make sure this was not in vain.' A school district official at Arroyo . High School in San Lorenzo, where Raquel went, sent her condolences to . the victims' families. The girls were killed near where Minna Avenue meets Brookdale Park, an area that is typically crime free . 'We're all so sad -- our hearts go out to the families,' Sharon Lampel, assistant superintendent of human resources at San Lorenzo Unified School District told the Mercury News. 'And we're here for our students and staff who need to get through this.'

While the areas surrounding Minna Avenue near Brookdale Park are notorious for prostitution, the neighborhood where the teenagers were shot is largely crime free. Police do not currently have any suspects but are offering a $10,000 reward for any information regarding the teenagers' homicides.","Bobbie Sartain, 16, and Raquel Gerstel, 15, shot dead Sunday morning .

A furious NHS matron has accused midwives of being 'rude' to women in labour and providing such a poor service that it could close the maternity ward, a leaked letter reveals. In a damning indictment of midwives, medical and nursing staff, the Lead Nurse raises concerns about a 'worrying trend' in the lack of professionalism. The four-page letter was written by Linda Birch, who runs the women and children's division of the Wirral University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, after a series of spot-checks. Unhappy: Bookings from expectant mothers are down at Arrowe Park Hospital because staff are considered to abrupt and rude, says Lead Nurse Linda Birch, who fears the unit could close as a result (File picture of midwives not connected to the hospital) In the letter Ms Birch states: 'The standard of care we are giving to our patients is not good enough and is deteriorating. 'Patients describe scenarios where they believe staff have been rude to them, abrupt with them and have been very unhelpful.' Among issues raised are concerns over record-keeping, lack of privacy and dignity for patients who are not given 'what they need'. Storage of medication and poor communication between patients and midwives is among the major issues forming another blow to the capability of the NHS. Critically the number of bookings made by expectant mothers has fallen from 300 bookings per month in January 2011 to just 245 a month. That means fewer than 3,000 births per year happen at Arrowe Park prompting concern that the maternity ward is not 'financially viable' and could face closure. Lead Nurse Birch writes: 'At less than 3,000 births, our unit is not financially viable. 'We know that the overall birth rate is up locally, regionally and nationally. 'However, we are losing patients to other providers because we are rude to them, we are not giving them what they need, we are not providing good care for them. 'They are going away from us unhappy.' The hospital serves an estimated 308,800 residents on the peninsula which lies between Liverpool and North Wales and 29 per cent of the population is below 30 years-old. A spokeswoman for the Trust said: 'Our Wirral Women and Children's Hospital is absolutely committed to providing the highest possible standard of care. 'We recognise there are always areas for improvement and we take comments, concerns or feedback very seriously. Rude: Midwives are accused of being 'rude' to women in labour, Lead Nurse Linda Birch said after spot checks at the Wirral Women and Children's Hospital within Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, Merseyside . 'This letter reflects the passion within our Trust to address any deviation from the very high standards we set. 'The aim of sharing information is to engage every single member of staff in the part they have to play in keeping our patients at the centre of everything we do."" The Care Quality Commission (CQC) perform random checks at hospitals to ensure that standards of care are being maintained at a high level. A spokesperson for the CQC said: 'We are aware of the concerns raised in the leaked letter and the information will form part of our intelligence gathering. 'The Trust will be expected to answer questions based on what we have collated when we pay a visit to carry out a full inspection of the premises and procedures.'","Mothers are leaving the hospital 'unhappy' due to 'very unhelpful' staff .

A quick-thinking teacher saved her sister from bleeding to death by using a passing pedestrian’s belt as a tourniquet after the pair were hit by an out-of-control car. Teaching assistant Laura Reddy, 23, suffered a shattered right leg when she was hit by a car while walking home from work in South Molton, Devon, with her sister Nadine Marchant. Ms Reddy was left bleeding heavily on the pavement after the incident - but Ms Marchant, 36, . grabbed a passer-by’s belt and wrapped it tightly around her sister's upper . leg to the stem the flow. Quick thinking: Nadia Marchant (left) used a passer by's belt as a tourniquet to strap up the leg of her sister Laura Reddy (right) after she was hit by a car . Doctors later told the pair that Ms Reddy would have bled to death if Ms Marchant had not acted so swiftly. Ms Reddy said: 'Thank God Nadine did what she did, I’m so grateful to her. She literally saved my life. 'This crash has turned my whole life upside down but it has definitely brought Nadine and I closer. 'The doctors said if she hadn’t done what she did I would have bled out and died before the ambulance arrived.' Injury: Ms Reddy nearly lost her leg after a car driven by a 90-year-old driver crashed into her in South Molton, Devon, last November . Ms Reddy said she could feel herself 'fading' following the accident and told Nadine she did not think I was going to make it. 'But Nadine kept telling me off and told me not to speak like that,' she said. The sisters both work at South Molton Community College in Devon and were walking home to Ms Marchant's house to prepare for a charity party when the crash happened. Motorist William Peto, 90, got his shoe jammed onto the accelerator pedal while attempting a three-point turn in his Smart car and careered into them at 20-25mph. Recovery: Ms Reddy, from Bishops Nympton, Devon, suffered extensive blood loss following the crash and spent five months recovering from her injuries . Ms Reddy, who has just graduated with a degree in Human Psychology from Aston University, Birmingham, said: 'We were chatting away when we heard a car’s engine revving heavily. 'At first we thought it was a boy racer. The sound was loud enough to make us both look up. As we did, right in front of us a car mounted the pavement, it all happened so quickly.' Ms Marchant was thrown onto the road by the car and was left with a chipped kneecap and badly bruised hands. But Ms Reddy took the full force of the impact and was hurled several . metres along the pavement - leaving bone protruding from her right leg. 'The car only stopped when it hit a telegraph pole and it was still accelerating when it came to a halt,' said Ms Reddy. 'My first reaction was to try and stand up due to the adrenaline and shock, but I soon realised the bone was sticking out of my leg and I couldn’t lift it at all. I don’t think anything can get close to the pain I felt, it was absolute agony.' Ms Reddy said she was screaming loudly and was convinced her leg had gone and there was nothing that could be done to save it. Despite . her own injuries, Ms Marchant went to her sister’s aid and asked a man who . was walking past the scene if she could use his belt. Paramedics then rushed her to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, . Somerset, for emergency vascular surgery before being transferred to . Frenchay Hospital, Bristol. Ms Reddy, of Bishops Nympton, Devon, was facing the prospect of amputation but doctors re-built her leg with skin from her back and left leg. She said: 'The possibility of losing my whole leg hung over me for several weeks. 'One of the Mobile International Surgical Team (MIST) doctors said it was one of the worst lower limb injuries they’d ever seen. It was touch and go for a while but they managed to save my leg.' Close: Ms Reddy (right) has praised Ms Marchant (left) for her actions. She said the incident has brought the pair closer together . She spent about three weeks in hospital before coming home where she was bed bound for about five months. 'My right leg is now slightly shorter due to bone loss and I have had to learn to walk again,' she said. Before the accident I only ever wore skirts and leggings but now I have to wear trousers all the time.' Nadine, who still works at South Molton Community College, said she often replayed the moment in her head. She said: 'Every day I walk past the scene and try to make sense of what happened. 'I wish I could have responded by pushing her out of the way but everything happened so quickly.I just did the only thing I could think of to help her.' Pensioner William Peto, 90, of Lapford, Devon, was banned from driving indefinitely on November 23 after pleading guilty to careless driving at Exeter Crown Court. He was also fined £2,500 and ordered to pay £100 costs following the crash in November 11 last year.","Laura Reddy, 23, suffered extensive blood loss after being hit by a car while walking home from work in Devon .

Bogus teacher: Julia Rawlinson, pictured, forged her qualifications to get two teaching jobs and a role with an examining board . A bogus teacher who forged her qualifications to get two teaching jobs and a role with an examining board to improve her 'social standing' was jailed today. Julia Rawlinson admitted leading 'a carefully constructed sham of a life' after almost a decade of deceit which saw her take on teaching roles in Northamptonshire and Devon, as well as with Edexcel. Rawlinson, 45, was described as a 'pathological liar' who concocted stories about her educational career and academic qualifications in order to create a life for herself and her family which commanded respect, Exeter Crown Court heard. Sentencing was delayed by months as psychiatric reports were ordered, but showed no evidence of any mental illness. Judge Philip Wassall said this was part of Rawlinson’s attempts to avoid the consequences of what she had done. Jailing her for 18 months today, he said: 'There is not a single word of regret or thought for the children who were at the wrong end of your activities. It is all inward looking. 'There was no mental illness here. You were never mentally ill. 'Your entirely self-centred approach to this has blighted the careers of everyone you taught.' The mother of four, from Brixham in Devon, said she had advanced qualifications in sciences from universities in Glasgow and South Africa, where she was raised before moving to Britain. She used those qualifications, supported by fake certificates, to obtain her first teaching job, at Montagu School in Kettering in 2004. But by 2007, she was already having her first brush with police when it transpired she had lied about the extent of her academic background. Rawlinson was cautioned for the offence but had already taken on a role as an examiner with Edexcel, marking IGCSE papers in biology. It was off the back of this position that she was given a one-year teaching contract at Westlands School in Torquay in 2011, where she was to lead A-Level students through their biology modules. But staff became suspicious when Rawlinson’s CRB check was returned just a few weeks into the job, revealing the police caution. Rawlinson, 45, was described as a 'pathological liar' who concocted stories in order to create a life for herself and her family which commanded respect, Exeter Crown Court heard, pictured . Rawlinson was arrested, and forged documents originally downloaded from the internet were recovered by police. She admitted two counts of false representation and three counts of making a false instrument when she appeared before magistrates in Devon in January this year. Prosecuting, Joss Ticehurst said students had suffered as a result of her dishonesty. He added: 'When interviewed by police in October 2011, she said her whole life had been a lie. 'This is a case which represents a pattern of behaviour of this lady lying. 'Even as she was caught out (in 2007), she was continuing to lie and create false supporting documents to obtain jobs. 'This was a carefully constructed sham of a life.' Defending, Lee Bremridge said Rawlinson was 'a pathological liar', but said she was undergoing a psycho-therapeutic intervention programme, at her own personal expense. She had had an 'awful childhood' growing up in South Africa, he said, and that her four children were a credit to her, raising them while her husband worked away in Europe, the court heard. Mr Bremridge said: 'She lied in order to create a life for herself, in order to create social standing as a teacher. 'She wanted social gain, not financial.' He said it was 'ironic' that the intellectual Rawlinson could well have become a good teacher, had she gone about it in the correct way, with the correct qualifications. Judge Wassall gave Rawlinson credit for her guilty plea, telling her she would likely serve half of the 18-month term before being released on licence.","Julia Rawlinson admitted leading 'a carefully constructed sham of a life'

Refused children: Danielle Florentine became abusive, even biting a police officer, when a teacher refused to let her pick up her two children when she arrived at the school drunk . By the time the police arrived at the scene, Florentine was abusive, shouting and swearing. On the way to the station she kicked the back of the van and continued to be aggressive in a police holding cell, prosecutor Eddie Harrison told Burnley Magistrates Court. The court heard how she had ‘lost track of time’ while drinking with a female friend after hearing her grandfather had just weeks to live. Florentine, of Padiham, Lancashire wept as she admitted being drunk and disorderly and police assault. Magistrates accepted that her behaviour was ‘completely out of character’ for her and she was fined £110, ordered to pay £100 compensation and a £20 victim surcharge. It emerged she had two previous convictions, including common assault on her former boyfriend’s ex-wife for which she had been banned from pubs.

Daniel Frazer, defending, said in mitigation Florentine said: ‘There is no suggestion this is a regular occurrence. ‘It seems to be simply a one-off. She had gone to the school and had been told the children’s father, her ex-partner, was going to be called to pick the children up. ‘That seemed to have inflamed the situation as she had been subjected to quite extensive violence at his hands and a restraining order had been made. ‘Understandably, she was upset that person was now being called to collect her children. ‘She was shocked at the language she had used, especially on school premises. 'Completely out of character': Magistrates accepted that her behaviour was a one-off and the court heard that the situation was inflamed when she was told that the children's father would be called to pick them up . ‘The children had not been present as they were being cared for elsewhere in the school. ‘The police officer had had her hand over the defendant’s mouth and she was struggling to breathe. ‘She is genuinely upset she is here. She is remorseful. There is no suggestion she is not a good mother. It seems to have been this one day, this one lapse.’ Burnley Liberal Democrat MP Gordon Birtwistle said after the case: ‘It’s a disgrace. She was highly irresponsible. I fully support the school for refusing to hand over the children to somebody in that state. ‘The most important people in all of this are the children. It is extremely unfortunate and I support the school and police for their actions.’ A spokesman for the school said: ‘We will continue to work with the family concerned in the best interests of the children.’","Danielle Florentine became violent when she turned up drunk at the school .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:55 EST, 28 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:10 EST, 28 November 2012 . Two nurses have filed a $200,000 civil lawsuit against the son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy after he allegedly assaulted them while trying to take his newborn son out of the maternity ward. The lawsuit comes just one week after the criminal charges against Kennedy were dropped, yet the nurses are still accusing him of negligence, assault and battery, as well as causing them emotional and physical distress. The incident at the heart of the legal dramas is when Kennedy tried in January to take his newborn son from Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, saying he just wanted the two-day-old boy, Anthony Boru Kennedy, to get some fresh air. Next battle: Douglas Kennedy, seen here with his wife at an April court appearance, had the criminal charges dropped but now faces a $200,000 lawsuit from the nurses involved . Several nurses objected, saying his request would violate hospital policy which prevents people from taking newborns out of the maternity ward for fear of kidnapping or infection. Kennedy tried to leave anyway, and two nurses claimed he hurt them as they blocked his way. The Journal News says the lawsuit was filed by nurses Anna Lane and Cari Luciano on Tuesday, a week after Kennedy was acquitted of child endangerment and harassment charges. Both testified during the criminal proceedings. The newspaper said Kennedy vowed to fight the lawsuit and called it an attempt to extort money from his family. The lawsuit comes as little shock, as Kennedy's lawyer Robert Gottlieb said that the nurses had been told that any potential lawsuit for damages would have a better chance if a criminal conviction came first. Family: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with his wife Molly and his son Daniel Boru, is the 10th of Robert Kennedy's 11 children . 'We were attacked': Anna Margaret Lane, left, . and Cari Maleman Luciano, right, were involved in the alleged scuffle on January 7 at Northern Westchester Hospital in . Mount Kisco, New York . Violence: One of the nurses is seen on the ground after she was allegedly kicked by Kennedy at the hospital elevator . Clearly that did not happen, as the Mount Kisco Town Judge John Donohue, who heard the case without a jury, ruled that Kennedy broke no laws. Judge Donohue said testimony showed the baby was not in danger except from the nurses' actions. Gottlieb said after the decision, 'Given the barrage of public attention, it took a great deal of courage from this judge and we really do appreciate it.' The hospital confrontation resulted in a series of alarms, including a 'code pink,' which is used to signal a baby's abduction. In his closing argument, Gottlieb called the alarm 'preposterous.' Confrontation: Kennedy, in the blue jacket, can be seen going for the elevator in the scuffle with one of the nurses . Hospital: Mr Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk . He said the nurses overreacted to . Kennedy's request and when they realized the hospital would investigate, . they 'join together, get their stories straight and pressure the . district attorney's office to bring charges.' Lane testified that Kennedy twisted her arm as she tried to block him from going through a door to a stairwell. Luciano said Kennedy kicked her as she reached for the baby in Kennedy's arms. Gottlieb said it was a push rather than a kick and was an instinctive reaction of a father trying to protect his baby. Many kids: Douglas, who would not be born until a number of years after this photo, was only one when his father was shot . Siblings: Robert Kennedy was shot dead in 1968, and he is seen here with seven of his 11 children in 1964, right . Kennedy also fell when that happened but kept hold of the baby. Prosecutors said his actions endangered the infant. 'The fact that the baby was not injured is a miracle,' Assistant District Attorney Amy Puerto said. She said Kennedy 'resorted to violence instead of simply complying with a request.' Kennedy's wife, Molly, accompanied him to the trial. A state investigation, including a visit to the Kennedy home in Chappaqua, found no evidence of child abuse. Kennedy, 45, is the 10th of 11 children of Robert and Ethel Kennedy. His father was assassinated in 1968. President John F. Kennedy, his uncle, was assassinated in 1963. It has been a difficult year for the family as Douglas Kennedy's sister-in-law, Mary Kennedy, hanged herself in May in Bedford. His sister, Kerry Kennedy, has pleaded not guilty to drug-impaired driving after an accident on Interstate 684.","Douglas Kennedy, the 45-year-old son of Robert Kennedy, was charged with harassment and child endangerment after the incident last January .

Lee Streeter was out on bail after being caught with a stash of the drug when the officer who arrested him exchanged mobile phone numbers. A month later PC Daniel Hughes got two text messages from Streeter saying: ‘Safe - got bone dry cheese if u need’ - dealer slang for selling cannabis, Stafford Crown Court heard. The defendant was arrested again and he told police: 'I accidentally sent it to everyone in my address book.' Lee Streeter was sentenced to 16 months in prison at Stafford Crown Court for drug offences . Judge John Maxwell jailed Streeter for 16 months. Sentencing him, he said: 'You were caught for this crime, granted bail and then you did it again - you were offering drugs and you stupidly offered drugs to police officers by sending text messages to the wrong numbers.' Streeter, 29, of Friar Street, Stafford admitted possessing drugs with intent to supply on 17 June this year and a separate offence of offering to supply cannabis. Rhiannon Jones, prosecuting, said Streeter was arrested on 17 June when he crashed his motorbike in Queensway, Stafford. Streeter, 29, was caught out after 'accidently' sending a text message to PC Hughes offering him drugs . Despite suffering quite serious head injuries, he tried to run off, pursued by paramedics, who caught up with him as he collapsed. Police were called and helped to restrain Streeter and officers found he had a bag containing cannabis with a street value of £180. He confessed that he had been dealing to a circle of 15 customers for a period of two months to raise money to fund his own cannabis habit. Before releasing him on bail, PC Hughes exchanged mobile phone numbers with Streeter. On 24 July the officer received two text messages from the defendant. 'Fortunately from the Crown’s point of view he sent text messages to the police resulting in his being found out,' said Miss Jones.

"By . Paul Bentley and Rachel Quigley . UPDATED: . 06:22 EST, 9 August 2011 . Jurors at the Warren Jeffs trial broke down in court today as they were played a chilling tape of the notorious polygamist instructing his child brides how to service him sexually and threatening that God would 'reject them' if they refused to have sex with him. Softly telling five girls to 'set aside all your inhibitions', the convicted paedophile was heard giving the young girls detailed pointers during a graphic ten-minute tape played for the Texas jury. The audiotape from 2004 was played before another, made within hours of the first, in which prosecutors say Jeffs can be heard having sex with all the girls at the same time. In one tape, he is heard telling the girls they 'need to be excited'. Jurors also heard him tell the girls that if they refused him in what he has dubbed the 'heavenly sessions', they would be 'rejected by God'. Chained: Warren Jeffs arriving at court today, where a twisted tape of sexual instructions he gave his child brides was played to shocked jurors . The children are said to have included a 14-year-old girl, her two sisters and one half sister. Several jurors squirmed or wiped away tears during the sometimes-scratchy recording. Jeffs faces up to 119 years in prison after being convicted by the same jury last week of sexually assaulting two of his brides, who were 12 and 15. The sentencing phase of his trial is expected to finish early this week. Prosecutors also displayed a page from one of Jeffs' journals. 'If the world knew what I was doing, they would hang me from the highest tree,' he wrote in 2005, according to one of thousands of pages of notes seized from his Texas ranch. To finish off their presentation, prosecutors reverted to numbers to push home their case and try to high light the full extent of his crimes. Using summary documents, they told the Tom Green County jurors Jeffs was involved in 550 bigamous marriages, including 67 that involved under-age girls. Jeffs, they said, has 78 unlawful wives, of whom 24 were under age at the time of the marriage. Of his wives, 29 had previous been his stepmothers, 56 were sisters to each other, and 35 had been students at Alta Academy in Salt Lake City, where Jeffs had been a teacher and principal for 22 years. Pictures taken by Nevada Highway Patrol of Warren Jeffs during his arrest near Las Vegas on August 28, 2006 . Arrest photo: A number of documents were seized from his car when he was arrested by Nevada Highway Patrol including sunglasses, wigs, cellphones and money . The under-age wives were as young as 12 at the time of marriage, and the jury heard and saw documentation of many of the individual girls. The jury were also shown photos of the polygamist leader riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and wearing novelty T-shirts and a baseball cap with a Guinness beer logo. The photos shown today during the sentencing phase of Jeffs' child sex assault trial were a contrast to the modest, conservative attired favoured by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, of which the 55-year-old is the head of. Other pictures introduced into evidence at the beginning of today's session showed stacks of $100 bills, sunglasses, wigs and cellphones. The materials came from the Cadillac Escalade in which the 55-year-old FLDS leader was captured in 2006, Broadway testified. Closing arguments begin tomorrow at 9.30pm. Stash: Police photographed the contents of Warren Jeffs' Escalade when they arrested him in Nevada in August 2006 which included stacks of money, cellphones, wigs and sunglasses . Nothing to say?: As the polygamist religious leader arrives at the Tom Green County Courthouse, his yellow legal pad is completely empty . Jeffs boycotted his sentencing phase for a third straight day, but made a brief courtroom appearance after being summoned by state District Judge Barbara Walther. She told Jeffs's attorney, Deric Walpole, that she wanted to make sure Jeffs hadn't changed his mind. Wearing a charcoal suit and carrying a blank legal yellow legal pad, Jeffs walked back into court but never spoke. Walpole said Jeffs wanted to stay outside, and he was escorted back to another room in the courthouse. Soon after, prosecutors played the tapes. Jeffs is heard telling the girls that what 'the five of you are about to do is important'. The recording ends with him asking the girls if his instructions are detailed enough. The voices of at least two girls responded: 'Yes'. Last week, jurors heard a tape of what prosecutors said was Jeffs sexually assaulting the 12-year-old victim. Sickening: Jeffs is seen embracing one of his child brides as he smiles at the camera . Prosecutors suggested that the . polygamist leader told the girls they needed to have sex with him - in . what Jeffs called 'heavenly' or 'celestial' sessions - in order to atone . for sins in his community. Several . times in his journals, Jeffs wrote of God telling him to take more and . more young girls as brides 'who can be worked with and easily taught'. Testimony: Rebecca Musser arriving at court today. Musser was Jeffs's stepmother, being one of the child wives of his father, Rulon Jeffs. She left the sect in 2002. FBI . agent John Broadway testified that fathers who gave their young . daughters to Jeffs - their supposed prophet - were rewarded with young . brides of their own. Girls who proved reluctant to have . sex with Jeffs were sent away, according to excerpts from Jeffs's . journals that prosecutors showed to the jury. 'If . they wanted to not be rejected by God, then the new laws [Jeffs] was . introducing was requiring them to participate in these sessions,' agent . Broadway said. The recording was played after the . court heard over the weekend from one of Jeffs's nephews, who told the . jury his uncle sexually abused him when he was just five years old - . warning him that no one could be told because 'this is between me, you . and God'. Warren Jeffs was never charged with . sexually assaulting his nephew, but Brent Jeffs says he and his uncle . reached a settlement in a lawsuit filed in 2003. The news came as shocking . pictures emerged showing Jeffs holding and passionately kissing an . underage female church member. As the court began to consider punishment for Jeffs, . prosecutors warned the jury to expect more sickening revelations, . including the fact he had 24 underage 'wives'. Other pictures revealed to the court today showed beds where ritual sex sessions were carried out in front of a church audience. State witness Rebecca Musser - a . former FLDS member who was married as a young girl to Jeffs' father, . former FLDS prophet Rulon Jeffs, told the court she had received . training about how . beds in the temple were to be used in sexual rituals before it was . built. Miss Musser said beds . inside the temple were arranged so that witnesses could see the abuse . and that a special seat was placed for someone to record the sexual . acts. Abuser: These are just some of the shocking images that show convicted child sex cult leader Warren Jeffs with one of his child 'wives' Also called to . testify was Utah psychologist Larry Beall who described Jeffs' grooming . of the underage girls as being 'like a peadophile'.

A 36-year-old Utah woman with a history of mental illness and long criminal record is accused of stabbing her mother to death as she lay in bed, where she had remained for several days before her body was discovered Monday. Airida Maria Gruodis told police ‘bad things happen’ when she's off medication shortly before her arrest. Police in the Salt Lake City suburb of Cottonwood Heights said Gruodis’ father blamed her for the killing and that they have evidence to prove it. Family tragedy: Airida Gruodis, 36, left, is accused of stabbing her mother, 58-year-old Zita Gruodis, right, several times and then leaving her body in her room for days . Peter Gruodis, 60, however, didn't report his wife was dead until police pulled him over at around 3pm Monday for erratic driving. Investigators believe his wife was slain a day or two before. An officer was interviewing Gruodis for several minutes when he unexpectedly blurted out that he was ‘distraught because his wife was dead"" in their home, a jail report states.’ Police arrived at the family’s home on Chadbourne Drive at around 3.30pm and discovered  Zita Gruodis' body on her bed with numerous knife wounds, police Sgt. Gary Young said. She was 58. Surprise admission: The victim's husband, Peter Gruodis, was pulled over during a traffic stop and told officers that he was driving erratically because he was distraught over his wife's murder . When detectives interviewed Peter . Gruodis again, he said his daughter had reacted with ‘indifference’ after he discovered his wife's body. Young called the husband's failure . to promptly report his wife's death ‘quite peculiar.’ The . mother, a Latvian national, had a series of protective orders filed . against her daughter in the past, but none at the time of the killing, . he said. ‘We've been there numerous times for mental health issues,’ Young said Tuesday. ‘It was very tragic.’Airida . Gruodis was being held without bail at Salt Lake County jail on charges . of aggravated murder and assault by a prisoner— she allegedly bit an . arresting officer's hand and had to be placed in a restraining hazmat . suit. Utah court records . show the woman has a seven-year criminal record complicated by a bipolar . disorder. She was most recently charged February 9, also with assault . by a prisoner. According . to court records, the 36-year-old woman allegedly kicked an officer at . the jail who was trying to get her ready to go to court. That felony . charge remains unresolved. Also, she has been in and out of hospitals and is under the supervision of a mental-health court, records show. Her father, Peter Gruodis, also was being held Tuesday at Salt Lake County jail on an unrelated domestic-violence warrant. Court records show he has a history of DUIs, medical seizures and car accidents. Zita Gruodis, who owned a massage parlour in Holladay, also had had run-ins with the law. On February 12, she was arrested for domestic violence. Online records list another arrest in 2004 on an unspecified charge. When officers visited the family duplex Monday, Airida Gruodis was ‘evasive and dismissive’ about her dead mother, jail documents said. Gristly scene: Zita Gruodis' body was found with multiple stab wounds on her bed in the Cottonwood Heights home she shared with her husband and daughter at least one or two days after the murder . Deeply troubled: Gruodis, pictured here in two different mugshots, has a long history of mental health problems and criminal behavior, including instances of domestic abuse involving her mother . She acknowledged being off her . medication, which means ‘bad things happening,’ she told police. Young . said he didn't know what type of medication the woman was taking or have . any information about her mental health condition. In a separate police interview, Peter Gruodis said his daughter had a ‘volatile relationship’ with her mother. In . a handwritten letter filed in June, Mrs Gruodis begged a 3rd District . judge to help her daughter. The one-page note, written in broken . English, reads in part: ‘… How she behave, it was insene,"" she wrote. ""I . just have one daughter, and she does'n have freedom,’ Desert News reported. Gruodis . claimed police forced her to get a protective order against her . daughter because an ambulance had been called to her house. Court records show a judge dismissed the no contact order at a 3rd District Court hearing in July.Neighbors told police they heard a loud argument between daughter and mother on the day of her presumed death. Gruodis’ landlord and friend, David Sollis, said he believes the victim’s daughter should have been committed to a mental institution if for no other reason than to protect her mother. ‘She is a threat to society and has been ever since they let her out approximately three years ago,’ he said of Airida Gruodis. ‘(Zita) loved her daughter. But she couldn't control her daughter's medications.’","Airida Maria Gruodis, 36, accused of stabbing her 58-year-old mother, Zita, multiple times .

Miss Hucknall had recently moved into a nearby flat with her boyfriend, 19-year-old Joe Jones, Miss MacDonald’s son. Abby Hucknall, 18, left, and Jane MacDonald, 38, right, were fatally injured as they walked to the shops in Fife . The two women were crossing busy Dunnikier Road in the town when they were struck. It is thought Mr Jones was so close to the scene that he heard the impact and rushed to be with his mother and the woman he calls his wife. He sobbed last night as he said: ‘I heard a scream and then a bang. I stood in between them. Abby’s eyes were still open, my mum’s were closed. ‘She was only 38 and Abby was only 18. And they’re gone. My mum and my wife, both of them gone. My mum and my wife were just crossing the road and got hit by a Land Rover and killed. ‘My mum was a great mum and the loveliest person. She stuck by me all the way. And my wife Abby – we loved each other to bits. We weren’t married but to me she was Abby Jones, my wife.’ Miss Hucknall and Miss MacDonald, both from Kirkcaldy, were heading to a nearby supermarket for bread and milk at 6:30pm on Tuesday when they were hit by a black Land Rover Discovery on the east-bound carriageway. An off-duty nurse was first on the scene and emergency services arrived within minutes. Sam Clark, 35, who was driving ahead of the Land Rover, described how she saw what happened and rushed to help. The staff nurse, who had just picked up her children from their child minder, said: ‘I was in the car in front. I saw the impact in my rear view mirror and stopped the car. I told my two kids to stay in the  car and I went to phone an ambulance. Tragic: Dunnikier Road in Kirkcaldy where the pair were fatally injured . Scene: It is thought Mr Jones was so close to the scene he heard the impact . ‘I didn’t see where they came from but I saw the impact and the girls being hit by the car. They seemed to be hit simultaneously. ‘The Land Rover stopped very quickly, as did I. We just got out and tried to help. ‘I went to the older woman, just a petite woman, and checked for a pulse. She had a very weak pulse at that point. I knew what to do from the life training we get, but it was distressing. ‘There was a paramedic with the younger girl and I went to see if he needed help, and then I went back. I started CPR on the older lady. You’ve always got to hope and just keep trying. ‘By the time the ambulances arrived, there was a doctor, nurses, a paramedic and a fireman helping as well. The ambulance was here in less than five minutes. The  woman’s son was here as well and he was very upset. I was trying to console him as well – he was trying to get his mum to sit up. It was a horrible situation to be in. ‘The driver of the Land Rover was very distressed. There were five guys in the car and they were all very distressed.’ The 34-year-old male driver of the Land Rover was uninjured. Miss Hucknall’s family paid  tribute to her. Aftermath: Police at the scene where the two women were crossing the busy road when they were struck . The driver of the Land Rover, pictured, was said to be very distressed by the incident . In a statement, they said: ‘Abby’s family are devastated by this tragic loss. She was a very bubbly, caring and beautiful girl, a much loved daughter, sister and granddaughter who will be sorely missed by all who knew her.’ Miss MacDonald’s large family, including her other children Monty and Patricia, last night gathered to comfort each other in the family home in Kirkcaldy. Although Mr Jones and Miss Hucknall were not married, they had been together for two years. Miss MacDonald’s cousin, Samantha Ward, 24, said: ‘She was a lovely person, a very good mother to her three kids and just one of the  kindest, most loving people you could ever meet. ‘They were just going to Asda to buy some milk, bread and other bits and pieces for the night when this happened. ‘It’s so tragic. They were both lovely people.’ Chief superintendent Adrian Annandale, of Fife Constabulary, said: ‘We are appealing for anyone who has seen either the two women or the dark coloured Land Rover Discovery to contact us. ‘At that time of the day it’s a busy area.

A nine-month-old kitten spent two days crawling back home after she was set on fire while venturing outside for the very first time. Hetty the kitten was found by owner Liam Garrard with horrendous burns from her shoulder to her hind leg on one side after she went missing in Crawley, West Sussex. She underwent major surgery to remove a patch of badly burned skin and was due to come home on Monday but developed an infection and had to be put down. Now police and the RSPCA are appealing for witnesses because they believe she was deliberately lit. Set alight: Hetty the kitten was burned from her shoulder to her hind leg on one side and underwent major surgery but she developed an infection and had to be put down . Mr Garrard, 22, believed she was set alight by ‘horrible, cruel individuals’ because of the pattern of her injuries. The Homebase manager said: ‘You have to be a sick, sadistic person to even think about doing this. ‘How could you purposely set a small kitten on fire? ‘I was beginning to worry because it was the first time she had ever really ventured out. “She was dead silent when I found her back in the house, which thinking back to it now was strange, and when I picked her up it felt like she was covered in mud. ‘It wasn’t until I turned on the light that I saw her entire side was black. There was a huge mass of singed fur. Vets at Seers Croft Vets, in Faygate, West Sussex operated on the kitten but her little body had suffered too big a trauma. Mr Garrard said: ‘The vets said it was a big trauma for her body to handle. The skin was cooked. I have been told by the vets it looks as though it was done deliberately. ‘She was probably asleep and somebody just set her on fire. ‘They compared it to a human losing an amount of skin from their chest all the way round to their back. ‘People need to be made aware that there are some horrible, cruel individuals living in Crawley.’ First timer: The attack happened on the first time Hetty was allowed out of the house and when she returned home, two days later in Crawley, West Sussex (pictured), Mr Garrard said her 'skin was cooked' Hetty disappeared for two days on November 13 and when she returned at about 6am on November 15 Mr Garrard discovered her injuries. Sussex Police and the RSPCA are appealing for any witnesses to come forward. An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘This is the most appalling type of cruelty to this poor, defenceless kitten. ‘Young cats can be very trusting and will readily go up to strangers. ‘For someone to abuse that trust and then set light to the poor animal is heart breaking, cruel. ‘We would certainly like to find who is responsible for this and for them to get the proper punishment.’ Animal shelter The Blue Cross recommends kittens should not be allowed outside on their own until after they have been neutered at about five or six-months-old. They can go outside after their first course of vaccinations at 13 to 14-weeks-old but owners are advised to accompany them in the garden.","Hetty the kitten was found with horrendous burns down one side .

At Halloween he terrorised the population of a Californian city by pretending to sneeze so hard his head fell off. The season for trick-or-treating is long over, but U.S. magician Rich Ferguson could not resist unleashing his grisly stunt on more unsuspecting victims - this time lurking in a lift to give people waiting to get in a fright. Mr Ferguson, also known as the Ice Breaker, previously stalked the streets of San Luis Obispo to shock a series of passersby with the prank - and his hilarious video footage of their reactions racked up millions of hits on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Prank: The man waits inside the lift to trick the unsuspecting people about to get in . Shock: The prankster pretends to sneeze so violently his head falls off - much to the horror of the man and woman waiting to get in the lift . After footage of his 'head drop' trick became an internet smash, the magician said he had only performed the prank in daylight because doing so in the dark would 'freak people out big time'. But Mr Ferguson must have changed his mind, as the latest video footage shows him lying in wait for people getting into the elevator at night time.

Now Jeremy Clarkson is set for a £5million windfall after the Corporation bought out his stake in his production company. The Top Gear presenter set up Bedder 6 five years ago with the show’s executive producer, Andy Wilman, to exploit the programme’s global brand. Together the pair owned half the firm, while BBC Worldwide owned the other half. But now Clarkson and Wilman have given the BBC full control. Scroll down for video . In the money: Jeremy Clarkson, pictured with fellow Top Gear stars (from left) Richard Hammond, The Stig and James May, has sold his production company to the BBC . It is understood the total deal for both men is worth around £8million. The money will come from the BBC’s commercial division. The production company set up by Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear executive Andy Wilman, right, was formed for next to nothing in October 2006 and has now made them millions. The pair went to the same prestigious private school in Repton, Derbyshire, where they were two years apart, before working together on various TV projects including Top Gear. Bedder 6 was later bought into by BBC Worldwide in 2007, purchasing half the 10,000 shares and also handing over merchandising and some foreign sales rights to the company. Its last publicly known financial results were released four years ago, where it made a £1.8million post-tax profit and paid out £700,000 to its shareholders. And now the BBC has bought Clarkson out - making him £5million. There is speculation about where the name Bedder 6 comes from, and it is believed it is a pun on 'better sex' - a reference to an in-joke about one of the dormitories at Wilman and Clarkson's former school. Martin Robinson . Separately, Clarkson is believed to be paid a £500,000 talent fee by the BBC from the licence fee, which will remain fixed if the show continues until 2015. In addition, Clarkson has signed a new deal with the corporation that will see him present Top Gear for another three years. Bedder 6 has had huge success making money out of Top Gear merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international sales rights. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: ‘BBC Worldwide has agreed new commercial . deals with Jeremy, James, Richard and Andy to secure Top Gear’s . international future for another three years. 'This agreement secures the commercial future of Top Gear without using a penny of licence fee money and allows us to continue to grow the brand around the world and return profits to the BBC.’ He caused controversy when it emerged that he earned £3 million in the year to March because of his stake in Bedder 6, as the company made pre-tax profits of £15.2 million and is estimated to be worth more than £50 million. It has had huge success making money out of merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international exploitation of the show. But Clarkson and Wilman, who have been . friends since their schooldays, resigned earlier this month, and BBC . Worldwide now have total ownership of the company. Showstopper: It has also been revealed Clarkson has signed up to present Top Gear for the next three years . Publicly the corporation is saying it cannot say how much the pair have paid for their stakes, but insiders say it is below £10 million. Clarkson will still get a share of Top Gear commercial revenue generated by the show, in return for promoting the show worldwide. His fellow presenters also signed a three-year deal with BBC Worldwide, suggesting that they will continue to work on the show until 2015, and will also receive money from commercial activities, in addition to the talent fee. The money will be paid to them directly rather than through a private company. Clarkson and Wilman’s windfalls because of Top Gear’s success have left many at the BBC uncomfortable as the organisation attempts to make cutbacks. By Martin Robinson . Top Gear's success has a lot to do with Jeremy Clarkson's efforts as a presenter and writer. But there have been plenty of problems along the way, and Clarkson has often been at the centre of the controversy. In November 2008 he decided to make a joke about changing gear in a lorry and how tough a job it is - and linked it to the Suffolk Strangler Stephen Wright - who murdered several sex workers in Ipswich. Complaining Clarkson said (pictured right and video below): 'Change . gear, change gear, change gear, check mirror, murder a prostitute, . change gear, change gear, murder.  That’s a lot of effort in a day.' In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'. A year later he made a joke about a woman in a . burka wearing a red G-string to illustrate dangerous driving conditions, which was branded 'distasteful'. Spin doctor Alastair Campbell revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment Clarkson was asked by him about gay rights and he replied 'I demand the right not to be bummed.' In other gaffes he compared a Ferrari to a person with special needs, called Mexicans 'lazy', 'feckless' and 'flatulent', said long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints as a result. Earlier this year he compared a Japanese car to the Elephant Man and people with 'growths on their faces'. But probably his most controversial moment came as he appeared on the One Show, where he said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families' (video below).

Meas Sareth, deputy police chief of the Phnom Kravanh distric, said: 'This is a huge tragedy for this poor family, as they have many children. 'Families like this face huge struggles just to survive every day – and for the mother to be struck down by an act of nature after losing her legs to an act of man is a double tragedy.' Lightning has proved a deadly natural disaster in Cambodia in recent years, with hundreds of people dying after being struck while in open fields. In order to grow crops to feed their families, farmers toil through all kinds of weather – including severe thunder storms. Although the government has launched education campaigns to try to reduce the risk, the problem has shown little sign of abating. The authorities said another answer would be the erection of large numbers of lightning rods, but the cost has prevented any being purchased.

In addition, 32 cattle were killed and five homes were destroyed. Last year a total of 165 people were killed and 139 injured by lightning. Cambodia already has one of the highest landmine casualty rates in the world after the bombs were buried in fields throughout the country during the 1970s Civil War. Statistics from the Cambodian Mine Victim Information Service (CMVIS) show around 850 died every year after being struck by a landmine between 2000 to 2005. This has now declined slightly to around 350 in 2007 and about 270 in 2008.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:13 EST, 27 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:13 EST, 27 September 2012 . Passing: Veteran actor Herbert Lom has died aged 95 . Veteran actor Herbert Lom, fondly remembered for his roles in the Pink Panther films during his half-century of movie appearances, has died at the age of 95. The Czech-born, London-based star appeared in more than 100 films including classics such as Spartacus, El Cid and The Ladykillers. He died peacefully in his sleep this morning, his family said. During his career, Lom portrayed Napoleon Bonaparte on two occasions, one of which was the screen adaptation of Tolstoy's War And Peace. But his most famous role was as fed-up and irritable Charles Dreyfus, the boss of Peter Sellers' bumbling character Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther films. He first appeared as the police chief in 1964's A Shot In The Dark and, as the films went on, became increasingly mentally unstable as a result of Clouseau's incompetence. During his career he appeared with such stars such as Kirk Douglas, Sir Alec Guinness and Charlton Heston. Prague-born Lom moved to the UK before the Second World War and worked as a newscaster with the BBC's overseas service until his acting career took off. The twice-married actor's first major screen role was as Napoleon in 1942 film The Young Mr Pitt, although his swarthy good looks led to him regularly being cast as a suave villain. Herbert starred as the annoying boss of Inspector Clouseau, who was portrayed by Peter Sellers, in six movies in the series . His son, Alec Lom, said: 'Like many actors, he never wanted to be pigeon-holed in a particular role and, after having played the role of East European gangster in many films, it was a delight to him later in his career to be cast by Pink Panther producer and director Blake Edwards in a comedy role opposite Peter Sellers, and he hugely enjoyed that move. 'He had many funny stories about the antics that he and Peter Sellers got up to on the set. It was a nightmare working with Peter because he was a terrible giggler and, between my father and Peter's laughter, they ruined dozens and dozens of takes.' Best known: Lom was perhaps most famous for playing the part of Charles Dreyfus, boss to Peter Sellers' befuddled Inspector Clouseau in the popular Pink Panther movies . From Pink Panther to Spartacus: The Czech-born star appeared in more than 100 movies during his 60-year acting career including hit films such as 'Spartacus', pictured in 1947 (left) and in 1995 . The Ladykillers: Lom, pictured here in the 1955 black comedy, later said the film was a 'perfect little move' In the early 1950s, Lom had huge stage success as the King of Siam in the original London production of musical hit The King And I at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, opposite Valerie Hobson. The part had been made famous by Yul Brynner on Broadway, who also starred in the film version. Other movie work included the title role in The Phantom Of The Opera in 1962, and Lom also featured in horror hits such as The Murders In The Rue Morgue and as Van Helsing in the 1970 chiller Count Dracula, which starred Christopher Lee as the famed vampire. Earlier in his career he had been denied entry to the States and was unable to take up a seven-film Hollywood contract. Nothing silly about this: Herbert Lom and American actress Martha Hyer in a love scene at the Palace of Herod during shooting the film The Big Fisherman in 1959 . Despite having taken British citizenship in the mid-1940s, he was denied a visa to enter the US in the following decade because he was suspected of being a Communist sympathiser. He later recalled: 'Everybody had Communist leanings. But I was not a lover of Communist regimes. And I admired America greatly, yet for many years I was not allowed in.' The visa problem was also in danger of scuppering his lead in The King And I as he was unable to take up the invitation to audition in New York. However, the writers, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, agreed to head over the border to Canada for the casting. Spartacus: Lom was turned down for a US visa in the mid 1940s, he later went on to global success . 'They sent me a ticket, and I met them in a hotel in Toronto. A piano was pushed into the room, I sang the first verse of A Puzzlement and Oscar said 'Stop, welcome aboard'.' Lom had three children. In addition to Alec, he had another son, Nick, and a daughter, Josephine, named after the French Empress and wife of Napoleon.","The Czech-born star .

Honeytrap: Prostitute-turned-nurse Zhao Hongxia (pictured) secretly film herself having sex with a Chinese Communist Party official after being hired by a construction company to blackmail him . This is the girl filmed having sex with a Chinese Communist Party official in a leaked internet video which has sent shockwaves across the country, it can be revealed today. Lei Zhengfu, a district party chief in the southwestern city of Chongqing, was fired from his position as district . party secretary after the video went . viral earlier this month. It was initially said the woman was his mistress, but it has emerged she was actually a prostitute allegedly hired by a construction company to extort favourable contracts from him. Zhao Hongxia, who was 18 at the time . the video was filmed in 2007, wrote on a blog that she was paid £5,000 . to sleep with Mr Lei which she used to pay for her father's medical . bills. Now a 23-year-old nurse, she said she was offered the money by the head of a property company. According . to the Daily Telegraph, she wrote: 'He was straightforward, asking me . if I wanted to be a prostitute serving some government officials that he . had a business relationship with.' The tape has caused yet another scandal for China's ruling Communists in the city formerly led by fallen politician Bo Xilai. But . it may just be the beginning as a whistleblowing former journalist has . said he may release similar tapes of more city officials soon. The . party is already reeling from the scandal which triggered Bo's purge . and further battered the party's reputation in the public mind. Chongqing, . the city that he ran, has been depicted by prosecutors and state media . as rife with cover-ups, abuse of power and corruption. Bo's . wife was convicted of murdering a British businessman, and Bo himself . faces allegations of corruption and obstruction of justice in the murder . case. News of the sex . tape, which was apparently shot in 2007, but only leaked this month, . comes as China's newly installed leadership ramps up anti-corruption . efforts as it deals with a steady stream of bribery and graft cases that . it fears has undermined its authority. The tape exploded on the Chinese . internet on November 20 when screenshots of it were uploaded by . Beijing-based former journalist Zhu Ruifeng to his Hong Kong-registered . website, an independent online clearing house for corruption . allegations. 'Extortion': Zhao Hongxia (left) , who was 18 at the time the video was filmed in 2007, wrote on a blog that she was paid £5,000 to sleep with Lei Zhengfu (right) which she used to pay for her father's medical bills . The lurid images, apparently taken secretly from a bedside table, show Lei having sex with a woman. Zhu told The Associated Press that Zhao, whose face is not visible in the screen grabs, was hired by a construction company to sleep with Lei in return for construction contracts. The company later tried to use the tape to extort more business from Lei, he said. Zhu said he obtained the video from someone inside the Chongqing Public Security Bureau who gave it on condition of anonymity. He said he was also given tapes implicating five other Chongqing officials but is trying to verify their content before releasing them. Zhu said that after the blackmail attempt, Lei reported the case to Chongqing officials sometime around 2009, which led to the construction boss being jailed for a year on unrelated charges and the woman being detained for a month. Xinhua reported yesterday that . Chongqing's corruption watchdog had pledged a thorough investigation of . Lei, who was dismissed on Friday, but said it had yet to formally . receive a report about the allegations against Lei or the footage. The . China Daily in an editorial today said the case showed that the . 'internet is worth being embraced by the country's corruption busters as . a close ally'. It also . called for greater transparency in handling this and other cases, and . listed a few of the lingering questions that the salacious case has . thrown up. 'Strangely, the mistress was once detained and the contractor jailed for blackmailing Lei,' it said. 'What had happened? ... These are crucial questions waiting to be answered.' Revealed: Screenshots from the video showed Mr Zhengfu, the party boss of Chongqing's Beibei District, having sex with his mistress . Disciplined: The Communist Party held an internal investigation into the video after it was first posted . With . a younger set of incoming leaders announced this month in Beijing, the . government is keen to show that those in power are worthy of their posts . and that wrongdoers will be weeded out. In his first remarks to the press after being appointed as the new Communist Party chief, Xi Jinping vowed to tackle corruption. The party's corruption watchdog underlined its zero-tolerance for corruption yesterday. 'There . is no place for corrupt figures to hide away within the party,' the . Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in a statement quoted . by the official Xinhua News Agency. Many . Chinese, however, are cynical about the allegations against . high-profile party members and that they signal a true crackdown on . corruption. Many think . Bo was no more or less dirty than the average Chinese politician and . that he was deposed not for his behaviour but because he was on the . losing end of factional power struggle. Xiao Weilong, 30, an insurance salesman in Beijing, bemoaned how 'ordinary people can't do anything about' cases such as Lei's. 'These sorts of abnormal things have become the norm, and we don't have any say,' he said. Zhu, . the journalist who broke the Lei story, said the fact that his website . had not been blocked despite the allegations it outlined was a possible . sign that the government is more serious than in the past getting tough . on corruption. 'Possibly . what we are seeing is that the new leaders are perhaps taking steps . toward enforcing the constitution, a sliver of a new dawn,' he said. The Chinese term for mistress — ernai; or second wife — is thought to go back to the polygamous tradition that developed amongst some of the country's ruling elite during the country's imperial period. Keeping a mistress is still viewed as a status symbol among some senior Chinese government officials and wealthy businessmen as has been revealed by recent scandals - including that of Lei Zhengfu. Some Government ministers have been revealed to have had multiple mistresses. One former minister is believed to have had as many as 18 mistresses, according to the New York Times. The women involved are often bought lavish gifts by their lover, from jewellery to luxury apartments and sports cars. The issue has, however, led to a growing public backlash, as stories of the excesses involved have beaten the state's censors to been leaked onto the internet.","Zhao Hongxia paid to film herself having sex with party chief Lei Zhengfu .

Accused: Peter Petrauske, pictured, faces three charges of indecent assault and one of rape . Mrs James, who divorced Kemp after his arrest last December, . said: 'My husband knew about it, he wanted me to. It was a wife swapping . stage we went through.' She said her then husband also slept with another woman in their home in Falmouth, Cornwall, as she she slept downstairs. She said she knew her husband went to witches’ meetings with ‘German . Pete’ but she told him she didn’t want to go or to know about it. She told the court: 'I did go to German Pete’s home and see a lot of . weird ornaments and statues.

Victims were allegedly plied with alcohol before being . ordered to strip naked in front of a crowd of men wearing ceremonial . robes and who used daggers and wax as part of ritualistic sex abuse. The allegations of child abuse came to light at a birthday party, said Mrs James, at which a lot of alcohol was consumed and her husband was accused of . rape. Prosecutor Jason Beal said some of the alleged assaults took the form . of rituals with the victims being made to strip before having their . wrists bound. One victim told police of naked children being forced to dance ‘like models’ for the adults who were dressed in robes. She claimed she was tied to a chair and blindfolded. She said on another occasion her wrists were bound and a ceremonial dagger was drawn over her body. Mr Beal said: 'She was taken to a house where pagans were present. Jack Kemp was present and German Pete was also there. 'She was given alcohol, told to dance in front of the camera and take her clothes off. She was given £5 and a bag of sweets.' Mr Beal said the white witches then exposed themselves and made an indecent proposition. Petrauske is alleged to have told police he was ‘a white witch, a . Pagan and not a Christian’ and ‘the high priest of a white witch coven’. The alleged abuse charges cover a period of more than 30 years from the late 1970s to 2009.

Last week, Muslim Brotherhood leader Morsi introduced what he claimed were temporary emergency measures. These included removing the possibility of any authority revoking his decisions. The high court of appeal is led by Mohammed Mumtaz Metwali, who also chairs the Supreme Judiciary Council, which oversees the nation's court system. Members of the council met Morsi on Monday to discuss his decrees. A statement issued later by the presidential palace strongly suggested that the president's explanation of the decrees satisfied the council, but the panel has not publicly commented on the issue. A statement by the judges of the high appeals court, known as the Court of Cassation, described Morsi's decrees as an ‘unprecedented’ assault on the judiciary and its principles that ‘defies belief’. It said the decision to stop work at all its circuits was also unprecedented but justified by the ‘magnitude’ of the crisis.

President's opponents and supporters clash in Alexandria last week after Morsi introduced what he claimed were temporary emergency measures which included removing the possibility of any authority revoking his decisions . The developments are likely to stoke the political turmoil triggered by Morsi’s power grab, as protests continue in Cairo against the president. Earlier this week, some 200,000 demonstrators gathered in Tahrir Square, the site of the protests which toppled President Hosni Mubarak’s regime in 2011. Clashes between some protesters and police continued yesterday and organisers said that they could mobilise millions to keep the demonstrations going. They plan another large rally in the capital tomorrow. The liberal opposition has said it will not enter a dialogue with the president about the crisis until he rescinds his decrees. Protest gathering: Some 200,000 demonstrators gathered in Tahrir Square and organisers say they could mobilise millions to keep the demonstrations going . A ruling, regardless of which way it goes, would constitute a direct challenge to Morsi, who took office in June as Egypt's first freely elected president but has enraged pro-democracy activists who claim he is acting too much like the authoritarian leader he replaced. The court also denounced Morsi's claim that it was part of a ‘conspiracy’ against him. ‘The allegation that the (June) ruling was reached in complicity with others to bring down elected state institutions and consequently the state's collapse ... is incorrect and untrue,’ the constitutional court said in a statement read by its deputy chairman, Maher Sami, in a televised news conference. ‘But what is most saddening for the court's judges came when the president of the republic joined, in a painful and cruel surprise, the continuing attacks against the constitutional court,’ it said, alluding to comments made by Morsi on Friday in which he said the June ruling was leaked ahead of its official announcement.

Top Democrats including White House aides hinted that they may use concessions on taxes and government benefit cuts as bargaining tools while dealing with Republicans in order to avoid the ‘fiscal cliff’. Such compromises would be welcome by Republicans, who agree with House Speaker John Boehner’s proposition that they would agree to higher tax revenues if they were suggested in a deal that included cuts to benefit programs. The goal of the talks is to produce a long-term deficit-cutting deal that will allow the cancellation of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year - the 'fiscal cliff' that numerous economists say threaten a new recession. Scroll down for video . Pointing out areas of compromise: President Obama said that he would be willing to work with Republicans in putting a deal together that involved both cutting spending and tax breaks . 'I'll go anywhere and I'll do whatever it takes to get this done,' President Barack Obama said as he sought to build pressure on Republicans to accept his terms. 'It's too important for Washington to screw this up,' he declared. The fiscal cliff is the ominous heading given to the group of tax cuts for all but the country’s highest earners as well as the funding to a collection of government benefit programs are all due to expire at the end of this year, and if the government doesn’t find ways to make up for those budget disparities they will not continue into 2013. For all the talk, there was no sign of tangible progress on an issue that marks a first test for divided government since elections that assured Obama a second term in the White House while renewing Republican control in the House. 'It's time for the president and Democrats to get serious about the spending problem that our country has,' Boehner said at a news conference. The leading Republican, like Obama, expressed optimism that a deal could be reached. Appealing to the masses: President Obama hoped to earn support over social media . Rallying: Though he said that he was willing to compromise and work together, Obama called Congress out . At the same time, he publicly disagreed with one Republican lawmaker, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who said he was ready to go along with Obama's plan to renew most but not all of the expiring income tax cuts. 'It'll hurt the economy' to raise rates for anyone, said Boehner. Separately, at a closed-door meeting with the rank and file members of his party, the speaker told fellow Republicans they are on solid political ground in refusing to let tax rates rise. He circulated polling data showing the . public favors closing loopholes to raise revenue far more than it . supports raising rates on incomes over $250,000. On . Wednesday, a group of corporate CEOs pushing for a deal met separately . with top Democratic and Republican leaders in the House, joined by . Erskine Bowles who was co-chairman of a deficit commission Obama . appointed earlier in his term. Clear message: 'It's time for the president and Democrats to get serious about the spending problem that our country has,' House Speaker John Boehner said . Speaking . to reporters before a session with business leaders, House Democratic . leader Nancy Pelosi of California said the bargaining ought to begin . where deficit talks between Obama and Boehner broke down 18 months ago . 'and go from there to reach an agreement.' Starting point: It is believed that Obama and Boehner were close to striking a deal last year and may begin their negotiations there . She didn't say so, but at the time, the two men were exchanging offers that called for at least $250billion in cuts over a decade from Medicare, the popular government health care program for the elderly, and another $100billion from Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. Among the changes under discussion - with Obama's approval - was a gradual increase in the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67, as well as higher fees for beneficiaries. Also on the table at the time was a plan to curtail future cost-of-living increases for Social Security, the government pension program, and other benefit programs. Those negotiations faltered in a hail of recriminations after the president upped his demand for additional tax revenue and conservatives balked. At the same time liberals were objecting to savings from Medicare and Social Security. Now, more than a year and one election later, Obama has said repeatedly he is open to alternatives to his current proposal to raise additional tax revenue. But he also says he will refuse to sign . legislation that extends the current top rates on incomes over $200,000 . for individuals and $250,000 for couples. Coming together: Erskine Bowles, former co-chairman of a deficit commission Obama appointed earlier in his term, joined a group of CEOs and Republicans who met on Capitol Hill on Wednesday . Instead, he is pushing Congress to renew expiring tax cuts for all income below those levels as an interim measure - an offer Boehner and Republicans generally say is unacceptable because it would mean higher taxes on small business owners. Bowles said during the day that Obama might be willing to back off his demand that the top rate revert all the way from 35 per cent to 39.6 per cent, where it was a decade ago before tax cuts sought by then-President George W. Bush took effect. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney sidestepped questions. 'If I told you how much flexibility the president had, it would eliminate his flexibility,' he said. While the obstacles are numerous, there are other political imperatives pushing the two sides toward an agreement. Unemployment benefits expire for some of the long-term jobless at the end of the year. Additionally the government is expected to need an increase in borrowing authority early next year or face the possibility of a default. Any agreement on that is expected to raise the current $16.4trillion level.","President Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner both said they were willing to compromise to find ways to avoid the dramatic tax and benefit spending cuts that will come at the end of the year .

Shocking treatment: Pregnant woman Malaika Brooks (not pictured) was tasered three times by police officers after refusing to get out of the car when she stopped for speeding (file image) A pregnant woman was tasered three times by police officers after she was pulled over for speeding while taking her son to school. Malaika Brooks, who was due to give birth two months later, accepted that she had been travelling at 32mph in a 20mph zone outside the African American Academy in Seattle. But when she refused to sign the ticket because she wrongly thought it was an admission of guilt, the officers moved in to arrest her. She was ordered to get out of her vehicle, but she again refused to comply, so one officer twisted her arm behind her back while another tasered her in the thigh. Thirty seconds later, she was tasered again, this time in her left arm followed by another jolt to her neck. She finally fell over and was dragged face down into the street before being cuffed with her hands behind her back. Ms Brooks, who went on to give birth to a healthy baby girl, was later convicted of refusing to sign the ticket, although not for resisting arrest. Excessive force? Ms Brooks was hit in the thigh, arm and neck before being dragged out of her vehicle and handcuffed . But the case has made its way to highest court in the United States after the Seattle mother tried to sue the three officers for causing injuries that left her with three permanent scars. The officers won a split decision in October from a 10-member panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. The judges ruled that the officers had used excessive force, but were not liable for damages because the law on the issue was not clear in 2004, when the incident happened, it was reported in the New York Times. The taser had been used in 'drive-stun' mode, which delivers only localised pain, which the panel deemed not to be a safety threat. Appeal: Although being cleared of using excessive force, the three officers have now gone to the Supreme Court (above) in an attempt to preserve the technique . But they said it could give rise to a lawsuit for a jury to decide on. Chief Judge Alex Kozinski said Ms Brooks had been 'deaf to reason' and that the officers 'deserved our praise'. But the cops have now decided to appeal to the Supreme Court in an attempt to clarify the law and preserve what they believe to be a 'useful pain technique.' Ms Brooks, who is pursing claims under state law, has urged the court not to hear the appeal. Michael Williams, a lawyer at Kirkland & Ellis, which represents Ms. Brooks, told the New York Times: 'The officers are trying to defend inexcusable conduct. 'They inflicted enormous pain on a woman who was especially vulnerable over what was essentially a traffic violation.'","Malaika Brooks lost damages claim even though judges said officers had used excessive force .

Ms Wells's Facebook page, which no longer exists, included a photograph of two white-haired patients with the caption: 'She’s the one on the left!!!.' Messages on the page then made fun of one of the women, saying she had 'started boffing' - slang for breaking wind. The photograph shows the elderly patient with a bandage over her head. One of her Facebook friends posted a reply saying: 'What has she got across her head? 'Maybe she isn’t putting her toilet pants in the right place and this is why she’s having accident.' In another message Ms Wells said: 'She asked me if I’d get her teeth for her, omg NO WAY!!!' Privacy 'breached': A photograph of two elderly patients on the ward, posted on Helen Wells's Facebook page, attracted a string of comments . Another of Ms Wells's friends posted: 'Why have they put you in the old birds ward!!!! That’s just cruel.' Relatives of the elderly patient, who has not been named, have complained to the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, which runs the 500-bed hospital.

Revolt to oust him: Richard Burnell stepped aside as Father Christmas after residents complained that he could not speak Welsh . With his authentic bushy beard and red suit, Richard Burnell appeared the obvious choice to inhabit the Christmas grotto at his local museum. But that wasn’t enough for parents on the Isle of Anglesey. Because when they learned that Father Christmas could not speak Welsh they mounted a revolt to oust him. Yesterday the 72-year-old retired housing officer admitted he had stepped aside after complaints that he wouldn’t be able to listen to children’s wish lists in their native tongue. Mr Burnell, who belongs to an American organisation called the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas, was due to don his red suit for the opening of the Christmas grotto at Oriel Ynys Mon, the island’s history and culture museum, in Langefni, on December 9. But when parents realised he wasn’t bilingual they lodged complaints with the local council. ‘I think it is a disgrace that you have an English-only Father Christmas coming to Oriel Ynys Mon,’ one mother said. ‘It’s going to cost £2.50 a child to meet him, so I’d expect they could find one who can speak Welsh. ‘I have young children who are still not that confident when speaking English, I think it is a shame they won’t be able to chat to Father Christmas in their own language. ‘The Oriel should be supporting the Welsh language.’ Pat West, principal archives, museums and cultural officer, defended the decision to hire Mr Burnell, but said he had decided to step aside after learning of opposition to his appointment. ‘There are lots of Santas around but this one is one of a few who has a real beard and I felt we were very lucky to be able to bring him here,’ she added. ‘I was going to be one of his helpers. ‘It is very disappointing, I never thought the Welsh language would be a question on this.’ When contacted by the Daily Mail yesterday, Mr Burnell, who has been playing Father Christmas for 12 years, insisted there were no hard feelings. ‘I was asked if I could speak Welsh and I had to admit that I’m not able to hold a conversation,’ he added. ‘I was born in Birkenhead and my father was Welsh. I’ve lived here since 1949 and have tried to learn Welsh. I can get by, but not in a long conversation. ‘I’ve no real need for it as no-one in my home speaks it.’ Mr . Burnell, who has 27 engagements at schools and civic events, across . north Wales this year, added: ‘I have no hard feelings about it. ‘If . they want a bilingual Father Christmas that’s quite all right with me, I . am happy to stand aside. I don’t do this for the politics or the . nationalism, but for the children. No hard feelings: Mr Burnell said he cannot hold a conversation in Welsh and so was happy to stand aside. He said: 'I don’t do this for the politics or the nationalism, but for the children' ‘I enjoy being Father Christmas and on Christmas morning I’ll be doing my rounds at the Stanley Hospital here. ‘No one has mentioned the Welsh language before, but it is no problem so far as I’m concerned. My outfit has cost nearly £400 pounds but the children love it.’ A spokesman for Anglesey County Council said: ‘We can confirm that Santa Claus/Sion Corn will be bilingual and he looks forward to celebrating the magic of Christmas with children visiting Oriel Ynys Mon next month.’ The row comes just weeks after parents launched a protest group opposing the use of Welsh in primary schools in Mid-wales. At one school, it was claimed, children as young as four were being refused permission to go to the toilet unless they asked in Welsh and at another parents were dissuaded from reading bedtime stories to youngsters in English in case it hindering the development of their native tongue.","Richard Burnell, 72, cannot hold a conversation in Welsh .
