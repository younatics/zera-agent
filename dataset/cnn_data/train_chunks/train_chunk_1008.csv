"Environmental writer Paul Brodeur has filed a $1 million defamation lawsuit against the producers of American Hustle for misquoting him in the hit film's memorable microwave fire scene. The 83-year-old journalist filed his lawsuit against Atlas Entertainment, Annapurna Productions and Columbia Pictures, according to an article on Thursday by TMZ. Jennifer Lawrence as Rosalyn in the scene started a small kitchen fire after putting a metal container in the newfangled device that con man Irving Rosenfeld, played by Christian Bale, called a 'science oven'. Scroll down for video . The scene: Jennifer Lawrence’s character Roslyn tells her husband, Irving, played by Christian Bale, that microwaves take the nutrition out of food and quotes an article by Paul Brodeur, who claims he never said that . The plaintiff: Paul Brodeur, shown writing in 1989, sued the producers of American Hustle for including a reference to him in the film's memorable 'science oven' fire scene . Irving becomes upset because he previously warned Rosalyn not to put metal in the microwave, but she puts him on the defensive by claiming that she read in an article that microwaves 'take all the nutrition out of food.' 'I read it in an article, look, by Paul Brodeur,' Rosalyn said while handing Irving a magazine. 'Bring something into this house that's going to take all the nutrition out of our food and then light our house on fire. Thank god for me,' she said in one of the film's comic moments. Science oven: Jennifer Lawrence's Rosalyn character stared an kitchen fire after putting a metal container into the newfangled 'science oven' Brodeur in his lawsuit claimed that his reputation in the scientific community has suffered as a result of the scene and he's been subject to scorn and ridicule. While writing variously pieces about microwaves over the years, including a book called The Zapping of America, he claims to have never said that the cooking devices affect the nutrients of food. The author was seeking $1 million from the defendants, according to the lawsuit. He also was seeking a court order to have his name removed from all copies of the film. In an article: Rosalyn hands Irving an article about microwaves that she claimed was written by Paul Brodeur . The 'science oven' fire scene was the first clip from the movie that was released in November 2013 before its opening. The film was released in December 2013 and went on to earn more than $250 million while gaining 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picutre. The story was loosely based on the FBI's ABSCAM sting operation in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Yahoo! are reporting that the lawsuit will be interesting, because the disclaimer at the start of the film said: 'Some of this actually happened.' The film starred Bale, Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Amy Adams, and was written by Russell and Eric Warren Singer. Brodeur earlier this year wrote a letter to the Huffington Post stating that he never wrote 'in any way that a microwave does any such thing' after the site included the 'science oven' scene among its 17 favourite movie moments of 2013. He noted that he sent a 'strongly worded letter' to American Hustle producers claiming they defamed him and damaged his reputation. Brodeur became a staff writer for The New Yorker in 1958 and has published numerous investigative science articles.

"David Cameron has taken credit for the European Commission's acknowledgement that controls may be needed over the free movement of workers . David Cameron last night claimed victory after Brussels agreed that restrictions on the free movement of workers may be needed when new countries join the EU. Countries such as Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia and Turkey have all applied to join the union and have started negotiations. The Prime Minister has long argued that transitional controls must be imposed if these countries are granted accession, to ensure that poor workers do not flood Western Europe looking for work. He has promised renegotiation with the EU to get powers back to Westminster, including powers to enable us to crack down on free movement, with an in/out referendum to be held by the end of 2017. Brussels has so far always argued against such moves, saying the free movement of workers was an unshakable tenet of the European project. But yesterday the European Commission gave Mr Cameron some hope. It published its updated ‘enlargement strategy’ for 2014/15, containing project reports for each applicant country. This report comes out every year but, for the first time, it makes clear that negotiations on future countries joining will need to address the nature of transitional controls and the possible need for a safeguard mechanism on the free movement of workers. The report said: ‘The possible need for and nature of transitional measures and/or a safeguard mechanism on the free movement of workers will be addressed in the course of accession negotiations on future enlargement, taking into account a future impact assessment.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘People across Europe are increasingly worried about the impact of immigration on their local community and this is an issue we need to address. ‘Less than a year ago, I kicked off a debate about how we prevent vast population movements across our continent when new countries join and I’m pleased that the Commission have acknowledged we need to look at this issue before more countries join. ‘This shows how when we lead the debate in Europe, we can shape it and make sure that the EU starts dealing with people’s concerns.’ A Number 10 source accepted that there is still much to be debated and agreed, but said it was ‘welcome’ to see the European Commission raising the issue. Meanwhile, last night a committee of MEPs finally approved Lord Hill as European commissioner for financial services – 45 in favour and 13 against. Lord Hill has been approved as European commissioner for financial services with a 45 to 13 vote . They had called back the Tory peer, a close ally of Mr Cameron, for further questioning after expressing concerns he would put the interests of the City above the EU. On Tuesday he caused embarrassment for the Prime Minister during the hearing by saying the UK would definitely be in the Union beyond the 2017 referendum.","European Commission's 'enlargement strategy' addresses need for controls .

"Amir Khan may be just over a month away from a headline fight in Las Vegas, but he is still finding time to live the high-life. The British welterweight had been training in California, but after a week of watching top sporting contests he splashed out on a private jet to fly to Vancouver on Monday night. Khan posted pictures of his trip to Instagram, including showing off the cockpit of the jet and commented 'It's all about going private'. The boxer poses outside the jet, on the steps and on board, as well as posting a picture of the cockpit . Khan said it was 'Good to see the boys in Vancouver' on arrival, after completing the short flight .

"Fastfood chain Hungry Jacks has hijacked a promotional campaign from its chief competitor McDonald's. Earlier this month, McDonald's launched its annual Monopoly campaign, promising 'millions of prizes and the chance to win $1 million instantly on a Big Mac'. In what has been branded 'Flame Their McOpoly', Hungry Jacks, the Australian variant of Burger King, has this week launched a counter promotion, promising to hand out free burgers, fries and drinks to anyone who presents prize-winning Monopoly tickets. Australian fast-food franchise Hungry Jacks are promising to give free meals to anyone who presents winning tickets from the McDonald's Monopoly campaign, which started earlier this month . On a promotional ad on the Hungry Jack's site, the website read: . 'Real flame-grilled taste, like air, is vital to life. No one should be denied it – our friends, our family and all Australians. So redeem your FREE tickets* at Hungry Jack's instead, because everyone deserves a better flame-grilled burger.' The bottom of the ad reads: . '*In no way endorsed or authorised by you know who'. On Hungry Jacks official Facebook page, there has been a medley of different responses. One user, Katy Johnston posted: . 'I like this! Good on you HJ's! Such a cheap and affective way of tackling the market! I'm impressed' There are over over 20 million prizes still unclaimed from the McdDonald's promotion . Others were less flattering, speculating that the restaurant could be facing legal snags over the campaign. Alicia Hughes wrote: 'Think I smell a law suit mcloving it!' Saffie Johnny-Moore, posted: 'How does it make you feel that you have rip off 'you know who's' ideas just to make a profit? ..Maybe come up with newer and fresher ideas and then you wouldn't have to steal other peoples. Another user, Liam, posted: I hope McDonald's sues HJ . Hungry Jacks responded personally, writing: Hey Liam! The appropriate legal requirements have been adhered to in developing this campaign . As of Thursday, the Maccas Play website said over 20 million prizes were still unclaimed.","McDonalds launched its annual Monopoly campaign earlier this month .

"They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and it appears that even the bluest of blood doesn't make you immune from the urge to copy other people. Sweden's royal family has released a photo of recently engaged Prince Carl Philip, 35, and his fiancée, in which the 29-year-old bride bears a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge. Like the Duchess, Sofia Hellqvist boasts long, dark hair softly styled into waves, while her fitted blue dress is reminiscent of the Issa number worn by Kate for her 2011 engagement portrait. Scroll down for video . Snap: Prince Carl Philip and Sofia Hellqvist's engagement portrait looks strikingly similar to the Cambridges' Indeed, the intimate pose also echoes the one struck by the Cambridges - and the one adopted by Carl Philip's younger sister Madeleine when she announced her own engagement to British banker, Chris O'Neil in 2012. Carl Philip and Miss Hellqvist announced their engagement in June, following a four-year relationship that sparked outrage in Sweden when it first became public in 2009. Miss Hellqvist, a former glamour model and reality TV star, had hit headlines four years earlier in 2005 after reaching the final of the scandalous sex and alcohol fuelled series, Paradise Hotel. The show sees five men and five women stay in a hotel together and included scenes of Sofia kissing pornstar Jenna Jameson. As a result, Queen Silvia, Prince Carl Philip's mother, didn't entirely approve of the match. Royal bride to be: Like the Duchess of Cambridge, Miss Hellqvist chose a blue dress for her engagement photo . Royal doppleganger: Miss Hellqvist bears a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge . Old life: Along with her stint on Paradise Hotel, Miss Hellqvist's CV also includes lingerie and topless modelling . Risque: Miss Hellqvist's reality TV career included a stint on a rather naughty TV show named Paradise Hotel . Reality TV: During her stint on Paradise Hotel, Miss Hellqvist was seen enjoying a bottom massage . However, the Swedish royal family appear to have softened their stance in recent months, with Miss Hellqvist becoming a regular sight at family events. Indeed, so complete is Miss Hellqvist's new-found acceptance, she appeared at the opening of the Swedish parliament with Prince Carl Philip last week. The pair's story began after Miss Hellqvist met Carl Philip - third in line to the throne - in a club in 2009. Since then, her wardrobe has had a royal makeover with the tight frocks and provocative ensembles of her reality star heyday thrown out and Duchess of Cambridge-style fitted shift dresses and court shoes in their place. But Miss Hellqvist isn't the only one with a wild past. Carl Philip was once famous for his playboy ways and for preferring fast cars to royal duties. Inspiring: Carl Philip's younger sister Madeleine, 32, also appeared to take inspiration from the Cambridges . Happy couple: The pair appeared more relaxed in photos taken on the day the engagement was announced . New look: Miss Hellqvist has swapped her reality star ensembles for a Duchess of Cambridge style wardrobe . Part of the family: Miss Hellqvist has found herself welcomed into the Swedish royal family in recent months . Stylish: Miss Hellqvist looked every inch the royal bride to be for the opening of the Swedish parliament . The prince had been with his previous partner, PR executive Emma Pernald, for 10 years before they suddenly split in 2009. Before that, it was widely believed a wedding was on the cards. In 2012, he hit the headlines over his 'Wild Summer' which included him being slapped during a night out in Cannes, hitting the Swedish party scene wearing an alien mask, losing his Gucci wallet and hitch-hiking his way to a motoring competition where he crashed his car in the first race. Like his fiancée, he also appears to have mellowed in recent years and spoke glowingly of Miss Hellqvist following the proposal. 'I have the incredible honour of being engaged to this fantastic girl,' he said, adding: 'Sofia has said yes to sharing the rest of her life with me.' For her part, Miss Hellqvist described the proposal as 'a fantastic surprise', she said, and said her initial response was apparently: 'oh wow!' 'I expected a totally normal day at work. I was amazed and a little bit shocked,' she added. 'Carl Philip is the most humble person I have ever met, which is what made me fall in the beginning.' Long term love: The couple looked blissfully happy as they watched the Swedish Open tennis in July . Celebrations: Shortly after the engagement was revealed, the pair attended Princess Victoria's birthday party . Part of the family: Despite her past, Miss Hellqvist has now been welcomed into the Swedish royal family .

"Yaya Toure's timing on the pitch, his ability to see the space, switch gear and bustle in at just the right moment, is exemplary. But the Manchester City midfielder must wish more of his peers and observers had the capability to match it. The Ivorian's superb individual goal against Aston Villa on Wednesday night was apparently scored by only the third best player in the Barclays Premier League. It must be some competition, the English top flight, if a midfielder can score 20 league goals in a potentially title-winning campaign, display such power, strength, vision and skill and yet only be third in the queue. Toure has claimed he missed out on becoming the first African to be crowned the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Player of the Year because of his nationality, but it's more complex than that. It's a question of timing and momentum and the value of stunningly memorable goal-scoring performances over relentless consistency. VIDEO Scroll down to see Suarez at the PFA awards and Toure crowned African player of the year . Unstoppable: Yaya Toure gets away from three Aston Villa players on his way to scoring Manchester City's fourth goal . Back of the net: Toure slots his shot past Brad Guzan to seal a 4-0 win for Manuel Pellegrini's side . Mobbed: Toure is congratulated on his goal by team-mates Stevan Jovetic (centre) and Fernandinho (left) On his own: This graphic shows how Toure scored his fine individual effort against Villa at the Etihad . There is also an element of style of substance at play here. It is blindingly obvious that Luis Suarez is a prodigiously talented footballer: nippy, deft, clinical and exciting to watch. But the Toure machine takes a little longer to wind up. He trundles around the pitch at times, his heavy frame looking more likely to succumb to injury than make a match-winning difference. But it is that burst of pace that makes him such a wonderful player. He simply has a higher gear than most of those around him. Watch the way he circled the edge of the area in the build-up to Stevan Jovetic's third goal for City against Villa: waiting, waiting, waiting and then, bang, he was in to bustle past defenders and provide the assist. You don't know you have been Toure-d until he has shrugged you aside. Individual awards are also about winning teams. Or they should be, anyway. Maybe not so much for the Footballer Writers' Association (FWA) Footballer of the Year, which is given to the player considered the best 'by precept and example' and was won by Scott Parker in the season he was relegated with West Ham, but certainly the PFA award. It should be given to the player who has performed the best when it matters most and, in 2014, this means when the Premier League title is at stake. Top two: Liverpool's Luis Suarez (right) and Chelsea's Eden Hazard (left) finished above Toure in the PFA Player of the Year vote . Key man: Toure has bagged 20 Premier League goals from midfield to leave City on the brink of the title . Patrick Vieira said: 'When you are voting for the best player, it shouldn't just be about the number of goals you have scored or the number of assists you have made. It should also be about whether you have done great things against the biggest teams in the biggest games. 'Look at what Yaya has done in his years at City – he is the biggest big-game player in the Premier League. 'In the Capital One Cup final this season, we were losing against Sunderland and things were very difficult, but then Yaya scored an unbelievable goal and we go on to win the trophy. 'That was the mark of a player – but Yaya does that in every big game. He makes the difference.' Toure, 31 next week, already has a Capital One Cup winners' medal this season, having scored City's equaliser in the final against Sunderland, and is one more win away from getting his hands on one the Premier League trophy, too. Comeback kings: Toure helped City beat Sunderland in the Capital One Cup final with this stunning goal . Driving force: Toure, pictured here scoring against rivals Manchester United, has been the model of consistency in the heart of City's midfield . But when the shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year was announced on April 18, Liverpool were two points clear at the top of the Premier League table. City were six points behind in third place, with a game in hand over Brendan Rodgers' side. Toure made the six-man shortlist, but there was only ever going to be one winner, Suarez, who duly lifted the award on April 27. That day, the Uruguayan had failed to break down Chelsea's defence as his side suffered a 2-0 defeat at Anfield. Some 230 miles away at Selhurst Park, Toure had scored City's second goal against Crystal Palace; a brilliant, powerful effort that killed off any Palace threat and put City in the driving seat to win their second Premier League title in three years. It was also a masterclass in performing when it matters most, and a timely, if unconscious, rebuke to those who had overlooked Toure's ability. On fire: Liverpool striker Suarez is the league's top scorer with 31 goals this season . Game over: Toure sealed a vital 2-0 win against Crystal Palace with this goal past Julian Speroni . Yet it was Suarez who was crowned the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year eight days later, too. Journalists could vote up until noon on May 5 and awarded the Liverpool striker a prestigious double for his then-haul of 30 Premier League goals. It's 31 now, a joint record with Cristiano Ronaldo and Alan Shearer in a 38-game season, and deserved recognition for a wonderful season. But had the deadline been just 24 hours later, after Liverpool's 3-3 capitulation at Palace, it might just have been Toure being honoured on May 15 instead. With the Manchester City midfielder it's all about the timing, after all.","Toure missed out as PFA and FWA Player of the Year to Suarez .

"Not content with being one of the leading makers of activity trackers, leaked materials suggest Fitbit is now taking aim at the smartwatch market. According to The Verge, the California firm is working on a wearable device dubbed Surge, which is set to be released by the end of the year and will cost $250 (£155). In addition to tracking calories, steps, and elevation - similar to existing Fitbit models – the Surge will have a built-in GPS tracker, heart rate monitor and show smart notifications on the wearer's wrist. The FitbitSurge is expected to go on sale by the end of the year and cost $250 (£155). It includes GPS, heart rate monitors and a sleep tracker. The wearable will additionally track steps, calories, distance and elevation – like current models (pictured) - but leaked materials state it is designed for more serious athletes. This means it will directly compete with the high-end sports watches, as well as low-end basic trackers, and as a result has been labelled by The Verge as a 'superwatch.' The details were revealed in marketing materials leaked to website's Chris Welch by a ‘tipster’. Release date: By the end of the year . Price: $250 (£155) Colours: Black, grey and orange . Features: GPS tracking . PurePulse heart rate monitor . Pedometer and altimeter . Smart notifications and music controls . Sleep tracker and silent vibrating alarm . Wireless syncing to the Fitbit app . Other features of the wristband include a more advanced sleep tracker, and a silent alarm that wakes wearers up using vibrations. Current FitBit models track runners using the GPS on a connected phone. It was rumoured that the Californian firm would release a standalone heart rate monitor called PurePulse, but this technology is now expected to be built into an upcoming device. This is expected to provide real-time workout data, and statistics - including heart rate, calories, steps, pace, elevation and distance - will sync wirelessly to a smartphone via an app. And the leaked reports revealed the watch will be available in black, grey and orange.

The application also continued that Fitbit's patented devices will link to phones to 'control volume and notify users of incoming calls or messages.' This suggests the devices will feature ‘smart’ notifications, including call and text notifications, on the wrist, and will let wearers control music from their wrist – in a bid to take on smartwatches.

"From the moment Natasha Kaplinsky was first whirled around the floor by charming dancer Brendan Cole in the first series, Strictly Come Dancing was a hit with the British public. As the newsreader stepped out in a succession of gorgeous, glittery gowns, wowing the judges with her fancy footwork, and opera singer Lesley Garrett foxtrotted through the series with super-confident Anton du Beke, viewers fell in love with the graceful dancers, elegant routines and beautiful outfits. Tasteful and wholesome, it was — at last — the perfect prime-time Saturday night show and exactly what viewers wanted from the BBC: a family-friendly programme that appealed to all generations. Scroll down for videos . Perfect in purple: Lesley Garrett with Anton du Beke in the first series of Strictly Come Dancing in 2004 . Red-hot Rumba: Kristina Rihanoff and Simon Webbe drew complaints with their routine in 2014 . Seeing is believing: Natasha Kaplinsky and Brendan Cole let their feet do the talking (left in 2004), while Pixie Lott and Trent Whiddon opt for racier attire (right in 2014) However, that was back in 2004. Fast forward ten years and the show appears radically altered. On Saturday, former boyband star Simon Webbe performed a rumba with Kristina Rihanoff, who was dressed in a racy, skin-tight costume that was so raunchy that it sparked a wave of criticism. Yet this wasn’t an isolated incident. This year’s show bears little resemblance to the first series. Gone are the older professional dancers, gone are the reserved, romantic routines, gone are the elegant gowns. Today’s dancers are more likely to be seen thrusting around on their partner’s thigh in a cut-away, bottom and breast-baring leotard. Such is the contrast that images from 2004 look not just outdated, but as if they belong in an entirely different era. It is hard to imagine in the current series the ankle-length, long-sleeved purple dress worn by Lesley Garrett. Nor can one imagine the explicit, overtly-sexual dances of last weekend having a place in the show of ten years ago. Peachy poise: Claire Sweeney looks radiant in a ball gown during the 2004 series of Strictly Come Dancing . Darling dancing: Caroline Flack pulls a provocative pose alongside dancing partner Pasha Kovalev this year . Carol Vorderman keeps it classy in a white dress in 2004, while Fern Britton shows off her legs in 2012 . On Saturday, professional dancer Kevin Clifton danced the paso doble with pop star Frankie Bridge with such hip-swirling passion that he split his trousers, Janette Manrara led a knicker-flashing routine with EastEnders star Jake Wood, while the encounter between Kristina and Simon seemed far more suitable for after the watershed. Or on a rather different kind of TV channel. As one viewer wrote on a fan forum: ‘Kristina is looking more and more like an adult film star each week. Far too frantic for a rumba, no “dancing” from Simon whatsoever and a really awkward semi-smutty atmosphere.’ The slide into sleaze has been so evident that even dancer Ola Jordan claims to have noticed, saying over the summer that the glamour of Strictly was starting to curdle. ‘We dancers are used to wearing tiny costumes. But on the show they are getting shorter,’ said Ms Jordan. ‘I understand some people may feel uncomfortable, especially the celebrities.’ Not that Ola seems at all uncomfortable herself in skimpy costumes. Her outfits on the show are modest compared to her calendar, now an annual release from several of the female dancers. Ola’s 2015 calendar shows her naked, with her peachy buttocks exposed insouciantly, while her colleague Iveta Lukosiute poses in underwear throughout hers — the black, strappy sort, often teamed with thigh-high boots that call to mind Julia Roberts as a prostitute in Pretty Woman. Kristina strikes various erotically charged poses wearing extremely little. It isn’t just the dancers who are showing off acres of flesh on this series of Strictly. Pop stars Pixie Lott, 23, and Frankie Bridge, 25, have worn costumes that are little more than spangled bikinis. Pixie has at least worn a dress — though one so short that the knickers had to be sewn in. In previous years, when the BBC chose more mature contestants, such outfits simply weren’t considered. TV presenters Carol Vorderman, 53, Carol Smillie, 52, and Emmerdale’s Claire King, 51, looked undeniably glamorous without pouring themselves into scraps of glittery material. As recently as 2010, Patsy Kensit, 46, and Pamela Stephenson, 64, were the grand dames in gloriously glittering dresses. Lower the tone: Siobhan Hayes oozes elegance in a blue number for the 2005 show, while Rachel Riley struts her stuff in a skimpier number in 2013 . But after Holly Valance, 31, the Neighbours star turned pop starlet who writhed in a cage in a see-through dress in 2011, Strictly must have decided no series was complete without at least one half-dressed pop starlet. But the push for provocative attire isn’t coming from the contestants. Coronation Street actress Natalie Gumede, 30, found the brevity of the costumes an embarrassment last year. She said at the time: ‘I kind of turn up on Friday and see how much material is in the dress and nine times out of ten I get some added.’ For a young actress to plead for an extra bit of fringing to spare her blushes says a lot about the show’s wardrobe policy. Though even those who don’t complain can struggle with the lack of clothing, as actress Chelsee Healey, 26, discovered in 2011 when a wardrobe malfunction left her crying bitterly after falling out of her dress. The BBC denies that the costume policy has changed, however. A spokesman said: ‘It is as it has always been. It has not become any raunchier. We have the same lady in charge of wardrobe and there have not been any orders to sex it up. Patsy Palmer poses in a peach number along with dance partner Anton Du Beke for the 2005 show . Patsy Kensit takes to the floor in a short sparkly number during the 2010 show alongside Robin Windsor . 'The costumes are an important part of the glamour of the show.’ Perhaps the BBC’s lack of concern over the sauciness of the show can be explained by a look at the ratings figures. Strictly started regularly beating The X Factor in 2011, helped by Holly Valance, Chelsee falling out of her dress and eventual winner Harry Judd from McFly going shirtless. But while Strictly’s ratings remain ahead of the ITV talent contest, its viewing figures have fallen gradually since 2010 — since, in fact, the outfits and dances got racier. Fitting with the raunchier image, the show’s professional dancers have also been replaced by younger, thinner blondes. In have come a phalanx of Eastern European hotties — Siberian Kristina Rihanoff, Polish Ola Jordan and Lithuanian Iveta Lukosiute, whose svelte bodies and blonde hair means they are virtually indistinguishable. Kristina wore a succession of bikinis with beads when dancing with rugby player Ben Cohen last year, and is continuing to ram home her sexpot image. But then, while such provocative attire and sexy routines might have been out of place ten years ago, this series’ racy rumbas, outrageous outfits and blonde professional dancers have turned what was a family favourite Strictly Sleazy.

"Shrien Dewani was framed for the murder of his wife by his driver and two hitmen after a kidnap and ransom plan turned sour, the British businessman’s trial heard today. In a dramatic twist to the murder hearing, Dewani’s senior lawyer told the court that a convicted murderer would be called as a witness to describe how Zola Tongo boasted of making Dewani a scapegoat when his new bride Anni was killed by mistake. Tongo, the state’s ’star witness’ against Dewani, told the 'lifer' that a plan to kidnap Mrs Dewani, 28, and demand a ransom from her wealthy husband ended in murder when one of her two kidnappers attempted to rape her, the court heard. Scroll down for video . The top defence lawyer for Shrien Dewani (left) told his murder trial the British businessman is being framed for the murder of his wife, Anni, by the taxi driver who is the prosecution's star witnessl . The Swedish engineer fought off her attacker and was killed when a gun went off as her two attackers fought, defence lawyer Francois van Zyl said. With the unplanned death of the honeymooning bride on their hands, Tongo’s first idea was to blackmail 34 year-old Dewani, but this was scrapped in favour of framing him for her murder, Cape Town's high court heard. Bernard Mitchell claims Tongo confessed to the plot when the two occupied nearby cells in October 2011. The inmate, known as Bino, approached Dewani’s lawyers with the confession when Dewani was fighting extradition to South Africa to face charges over his wife's death. Dewani denies recruiting taxi driver Tongo to organise the murder of his new Swedish wife shortly after they arrived in Cape Town for part of their honeymoon in November 2010. Tongo and two hitmen - Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - claim the successful businessman masterminded the plot to kill the Swedish engineer and promised to pay them £850. Mr van Zyl told the court Mrs Dewani’s fatal wounds, from a single bullet that hit her hand and then her neck, were consistent with a struggle rather than “an execution”. Dewani denies five charges relating to the death of his new bride, including murder and kidnapping. Dewani sat upright in the dock, occasionally nodding and smiling at his parents and siblings, as the court heard that Mitchell contacted Dewani’s lawyer, Taswell Paper, about a conversation he claimed to have had while showering next to Tongo, which began as an exchange about their prison sentences. The state alleges Dewani plotted his new wife's murder by recruiting taxi driver Zola Tongo to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £850 (R15,000) 'You remarked that you saw that he [Mitchel] got life,' Mr van Zyl told Tongo, who was giving his seventh day of evidence. 'He said he saw you got 18 years. And you then told him that you are glad you didn't get life, and you explained to him, when he asked why, that you were for fortunate to become a state witness, otherwise you would have also got life in prison. 'At one stage he asked you to tell him whether its true what he heard people talk about the Dewani murder. You did not want to talk, but he convinced you that you could trust him. 'He asked ""why was the woman killed? She was such a pretty girl. Why didn't they just rape her?"" 'You then said that your accusers who were with you in this jeopardised the whole plan. You explained to him that the plan was to kidnap her and to hold her hostage, but that the whole plan went off the rails as, when your accusers were on the way with her to the place where they wanted to hold her hostage, one of them wanted to rape her. A quarrel ensued and she was shot. You were informed of this. 'You then talked about blackmailing Mr Dewani, threatening him that if he doesn't pay you the money, you will tell the police that he asked you to kill his wife.' 'Bernard Mitchell said that you him that you were advised this was a stupid plan and would put you in trouble and that it would be better to frame Mr Dewani and to tell the police that it was the accused, Mr Dewani, who asked you to kill his wife to take the spotlight off you and the others. 'You were advised that in that case you would not get such a long sentence,' Mr van Zyl said. Asked for his response to the story that Mitchell will tell the court, Tongo dismissed it as 'nonsense and lies.' 'This is somebody who saw this on TV. Those are just prison stories,' Tongo said. Defence lawyer Francois van Zyl said a former cellmate of Zola Tongo, pictured, said the taxi driver told him Anni Dewani was killed by his co-conspirators in a kidnap and ransom plot after they argued about raping her . Van Zyl, pictured arriving at court, cited the cellmate as saying Tongo had told him that accusing Dewani of hiring him to kill his wife had saved him from a life sentence for murder . Anni was found shot dead in an abandoned minibus . The Hindocha family - Mrs Dewani’s parents Nilam and Vinod and brother Anish - shook their heads in disbelief as Mr van Zyl painted a picture of Dewani as the victim of a complicated conspiracy. And as Tongo finally stepped down from the witness box after more than five days of heated cross-examination, the father of five, clenched his fist and punched the air as he passed one of the police officers who had brought the case against Dewani, before being bundled out of the court. Earlier, Mr van Zyl told Judge Jeanette Traverso how Dewani had handed over R15,000 (£850 pounds) – exactly the amount Tongo claims he was offered for Mrs Dewani’s contract killing – in gifts to people who had supported him in the hours and days after his wife’s death. The cash was enclosed in African-themed greetings cards in which he had written messages and handed to hotel staff and even one of the police officers who were investigating his wife’s death. Tongo, who claims Dewani failed to pay him the £260 he had been promised to organise a fake carjacking to cover for Mrs Dewani’s death, told the court, “I am surprised that he gave such amounts to people but he could not pay me.”","Dramatic twist challenges testimony of the prosecution's star witness .

"Sanford Rubenstein (left), seen here at a 2005 party in Miami, is accused of raping a 42-year-old woman. The woman pictured here is not his accuser . The New York Police Department seized 'biological evidence' and a sex toy from the penthouse apartment of Rev Al Sharpton's lawyer Monday as they investigate rape allegations against the 70-year-old civil rights attorney. Neighbors and friends, meanwhile, detailed a seedy lifestyle of frequenting strip clubs and using his limousine to pick up much younger women, according to the New York Post. Sanford Rubenstein maintains that he had consensual sex with the 42-year-old retail executive whom he took home after the civil rights leader's birthday party at the Four Seasons last Wednesday. He has not been charged with a crime. However, the woman has told NYPD detectives that Rubenstein took advantage of her when she was passed out drunk and incapable of telling him no. Rubenstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman issued a statement to MailOnline refusing to comment on the Post's claims, 'even those I know to be patently false.' He also reiterated an earlier assertion that Rubenstein will be cleared by the police investigation and that he did not commit a crime. NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan on Tuesday and reportedly collected 'biological evidence,' according to the Post. Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy. The Post, quoting 'sources close to Rubenstein,' alleges a tawdry personal life that revolved around the constant pursuit of sex. One source told the newspaper: 'The guy’s hung like a cashew.' Another said: 'Every time I see him, he wants to tell me about his latest ménage à trois. It’s all about sex with this guy.' Neighbors say they often seen the septuagenarian lawyer with young women 'barely out of their teens,' according to the Post. One source says the Rubenstein is a regular at strip clubs. He reportedly spent to much time at high-end club Scores that all the strippers greeted him by name when he came in. He also reportedly paid an artist to paint a series of canvasses depicting the club - including a scene showing him getting a rub-down, the Post claims. Search and seizure: Detectives carried away several bags of evidence from Rubenstein's penthouse apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side . Rubenstein lives in the $7million penthouse apartment at the top of this East 63rd Street highrise on the Upper East Side . He currently haunts at a strip club in Hell's Kitchen that features muscled, tattooed strippers who are black or Hispanic and prefers women who are 5-foot-11 or taller, the Post claims. Meanwhile, attorneys representing the alleged victim  said Monday they have 'devastating' information about the alleged crime. Sources familiar with the case have claimed that the 42-year-old woman, who works for Sharpton’s National Action Network, went home with the 70-year-old attorney willingly last week, and even had sex with him a second time the following morning. But attorney Keith White who represents the alleged victim has challenged these assertions, insisting that a crime had been committed. ‘There’s a lot of new information that will be devastating to Mr. Rubenstein,’ White told New York Daily News. ‘We want to give the district attorney a chance to take this information and do the right thing.‘ . White's partner, Kenneth Montgomery, accused Rubenstein and his legal team headed by Benjamin Brafman of trying to 'demonize' his client. Describing the 42-year-old as a mother and a pillar of the community, Montgomery said her 'world has been turned upside down.' Investigators suspect Rubenstein may have used an object to penetrate the 42-year-old woman during the alleged attack in his $7million Manhattan penthouse, making her bleed, sources told the New York Daily News. The anonymous accusation, which emerged Sunday, is at odds with the source close to Rubenstein, who said the alleged attack that night was in fact consensual, and that more sex followed in the morning. The claims came as investigators spent hours searching Rubenstein's apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side for evidence. On Monday afternoon, police removed a dozen evidence bags, among them one marked 'biological evidence.' They also carried a mattress out of Rubenstein's apartment. Close: The Rev Al Sharpton, center with Rubenstein to the left, has said there is no place for the alleged behavior - but avoided jumping to the conclusion that he is guilty . As part of the investigation, police reportedly set up a call between the alleged victim and Rubenstein, during which the woman asked the 70-year-old attorney, 'What happened last night?' The lawyer replied that they had sex but did not incriminate himself, a police source told the paper. He has not been charged with anything, though law enforcement  sources suggested to the paper that are considering a third-degree rape charge, which means the victim was incapable of consent. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations today, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' Although he avoided choosing one side over the other, Sharpton said there is 'no place' for the alleged behavior, the New York Post reported. He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn’t mean you’re guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain’t no place for that in our community.' Rubenstein and his alleged victim were both at Sharpton's lavish 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant before they went home together, along with a third person, who later left. Other guests at the bash included New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee. A police source described the case as 'a classic he said, she said'. Law enforcement sources also described how Rubenstein was allegedly called by the victim, with police listening in, in an attempt to trick him into describing the encounter. Defense: Benjamin Brafman has been taken on as Rubenstein's attorney. Above he denies all allegations to waiting reporters . But, the source said, the call passed without incident and Rubenstein simply said that they two of them had sex. Rubenstein hit back at the claims Monday through a lawyer of his own - top New York attorney Benjamin Brafman. Brafman spoke to waiting reporters outside Rubenstein's apartment today denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'We do not believe he committed any crime whatsoever and are confident that when the investigation is completed no criminal charges will be filed'. The media-savvy Rubenstein currently represents the family of Eric Garner, who died after a police chokehold during an arrest in July. The case sparked protests and calls for change within the police department. He also represented the family of Sean Bell, killed in 2008 in a hail of police bullets. The city eventually settled with Bell's family for $7.5million. High-profile case: Rev. Herbert Daughtry, far left, Rev. Al Sharpton, second from left, and attorney Sanford Rubenstein, far right, escort Esaw Garner, second from right, the wife of fatal police chokehold victim Eric Garner, after a press conference August  21, 2014 . Rubenstein is a member of the National Action Network and has often stood arm-in-arm with Sharpton at protests. On Monday, Sharpton met with Garner's family and said he would discuss the Garner investigation at a rally on Saturday. Sharpton issued a statement on Sunday saying he was aware of the allegations. 'National Action Network and Rev. Al Sharpton has not been notified or advised by any official investigating authorities,' the statement read. 'The allegations as reported occurred at a private residence after a NAN event and had nothing to do with NAN nor Rev. Al Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.'","Sanford Rubenstein, 70, accused of raping 42-year-old last week .

"Belarus are looking for a new coach after Georgi Kondratiev resigned in the wake of his side's Euro 2016 qualifying defeat to Slovakia. Monday's 3-1 loss in Borisov left Belarus with one point from their opening three Group C games and led the 54-year-old Kondratiev to step down from his post after three years in charge. The Belarus FA confirmed in a statement on its official website that, following talks between the Kondratiev and BFF head Sergei Rumas, it was mutually agreed to terminate the coach's contract. Belarus sacked coach Georgi Kondratiev after their Euro 2016 qualifying defeat to Slovakia . Spain are up next for Belarus in their tricky group . Kondratiev said on www.uefa.com: 'The result is fair. We lost to a classier team. You saw today that Slovakia are on a higher level. It's not enough to just have commitment if you want to win - you need to be able to play football and we played worse than them. 'As we did not get a result, the coach has to leave. I promised that and I will resign. But our players will not play differently. That is the result of the last 25 years. We are lagging behind the leading countries. Slovakia are not a super-team, but we are lagging behind them as well.'

"Ian Poulter was playing a skins game earlier this week. You know, just for fun. Hole by hole, against some of his European team-mates, probably a few quid on it. Nothing much. Except Poulter was losing. His pride was hurt, more than his pocket. By the time he got to the 17th he hadn’t won a hole. The caddies were beginning to give him a bit of stick. Jokes about duck eggs, due to his big fat zero. Quacking noises as he walked to the tee. And then he turned up. You remember. Him. It was as if Poulter suddenly remembered where he was, and flicked a switch. ‘He birdied 17 and holed a bunker shot on the last,’ said Justin Rose, ‘and you know he’s in his element. He just needs a spark.’ Martin Kaymer put it even more succinctly. ‘When you see Poulter at the Ryder Cup, he’s different,’ he confirmed. Justin Rose (left) says all Ian Poulter (right) needs is a spark and he's in his element at the Ryder Cup . Poulter, nicknamed The Postman because he always delivers for Europe, has won 12 of his last 13 matches . Poulter has been paired with Scotland's Stephen Gallacher for the opening foulball matches on Friday . Asked if he knew what Kaymer meant, Poulter was clear. He was a different man in a team environment, he said. It reminded him of his days as a youth footballer. One imagines Poulter wouldn’t entirely mind it if for one week, golf could become a contact sport. That is what he brings to the competition. The equivalent of the little reducer tackle, the one that tests the mettle of an opponent. See how much they want it, says the manager, and this is what Poulter does. He can spot the weakness in a rival; he pounces at that moment when he loses heart. He did this with Webb Simpson at Medinah two years ago. Mostly, intimidation on a golf course is icily uncommunicative. It tends to involve sinking putts in frozen silence. Poulter is perhaps the first to capture the physicality of the rough-house sports, without quite taking Keegan Bradley out at the knee. Bug-eyed, screaming, every muscle tensed, lost in the moment, capable of anything. He has won 12 of his last 13 Ryder Cup games and averages 0.8 points per match. Colin Montgomerie is a legend of European Ryder Cup golf. His average is 0.65. Seve Ballesteros, the father of this European revival, averaged 0.54. Poulter averages an incredible 0.8 points per match, far ahead of the next closest best in the Ryder Cup . Fan favourite Poulter was already getting the crowd wound up for competition during practice . VIDEO Proud Poulter revels in Ryder Cup passion . It would be impossible to replicate what Poulter brings to the Ryder Cup in the other 103 weeks of the two-year cycle. If Poulter could play like this permanently he would be a major-winning golfer to rival Rory McIlroy. The intensity Poulter will radiate and inspire on the tee at Gleneagles on Friday morning is simply too draining to be bottled and turned to his advantage as an individual over four days. No strokeplay event could be won teetering on the brink of madness as Poulter does in Ryder Cup week. He is the embodiment of the ferocious team spirit that has driven Europe through its modern era of dominance: the heir to the mantle of Ballesteros, the first to take the fight to America with more than just a three iron. ‘When I’m part of a team it brings out a side of me that people don’t often get to see,’ Poulter said. ‘I loved my football as a kid, and I’m reliving those moments as a golfer at the Ryder Cup. ‘I played football back then like I play golf right now. ‘I’m one of those players that wants to help out in a team environment, too. Even if it’s a guy like Martin Kaymer or Lee Westwood, I’m someone that is proud to put an arm around someone, or pump them up to get them going. If Poulter could play like he does in Ryder Cup throughout the season, he'd be up with Rory McIlroy . Poulter says the Ryder Cup's team environment reminds him of playing football as a kid . ‘Intimidation? Matt Kuchar said I’m the worst player to lose to and I take pride in that. I have inflicted a lot of punishment and it comes from delivering, from holing putts, putting a lot of blue on the board. I’ll stand tall. ‘I’m proud to put the shirt on, to be visible, to show emotion, and if that’s intimidating and hard to take I’ll try to make sure it continues. ‘My record in the Ryder Cup is exceptional, in strokeplay tournaments it isn’t, but I think the emotion that goes through you when you hole a putt, from the very first day of the Ryder Cup, is like the emotion you have on the Sunday of a big tournament. ‘They all feel like tournament winning putts, and you sink a lot of them in a three-day spell. By the end, it feels like you’ve had more wins than you could amount in your professional lifetime. That’s why it is so physically and mentally draining. ‘You go through emotions that you just do not face week in and week out. But that inspires me. I embrace it. To be compared to Seve or Colin Montgomerie is an absolute honour. We’ve had some tremendous players, but we always refer back to Seve. He meant so much. Poulter takes pride in the Europe shirt: ‘I’m proud to put the shirt on, to be visible, to show emotion' Even with world No 1 McIlroy in his team Poulter is the prized scalp for the US team, says Tom Watson . ‘He had a vision to overturn the red, white and blue and tried to instill that in his teams. We still want to play for him and stand for what he was trying to do.’ Memories of Medinah 2012 are still fresh in a lot of minds, but images of Poulter stand out. After Bubba Watson had set the tone for day one by encouraging the home crowd to cheer throughout his tee shot, Poulter took up the challenge the following day. He could have merely whipped up a chorus of American boos, instead he was roared on by a strong European contingent as he struck his ball down the middle. At the end of the day he recorded five consecutive birdies to offer hope of a European revival, miraculously realised in the singles. Poulter won his, obviously. He has never lost on the last day at this tournament. ‘I think what Ian does with his reaction to making a putt is that he looks around and brings everybody in,’ said Rose, ‘yet he’s got this amazing ability to shut everything out at the same time. ‘It’s his eyes. If you watch them, he’s still in the zone, he’s not really taking it in at all. If you watch him putt, he’s very focused, running up and down the line. He channels in, which is the only way to play under pressure. You cannot afford to be looking around, to see everything that is going on. Ian has this great ability to switch in, switch out, switch in, switch out.’ Even more than McIlroy, the world No 1, Poulter is Europe’s prize scalp. Poulter shows what it meant to be an integral and inspirational part of Europe 2012 win at Medinah . The trademark reaction from Poulter when he drains another birdie putt that gets under his opponents' skin . Tom Watson talked of targeting him, even ahead of McIlroy, and it was no accident that he was chosen as the final European player to speak publicly before Friday's tee-off. European preparations extend to the running order of media appearances and with all 12 team members scheduled to speak it was a deliberate policy by captain Paul McGinley to leave Poulter’s address to last. He did not disappoint. Poulter refused to be drawn on Phil Mickelson’s attempt to get beneath European skins two days ago, but he still exuded a powerful sense of determination. His autobiography is out later this year, and a final chapter detailing Ryder Cup defeat would be an unfortunately dispiriting conclusion. Not that he requires further motivation. ‘I don’t look to see if the other players are intimidated by me,’ Poulter said. ‘They are close by, but if I’m doing my job, it’s not as if I need to look.’ And almost imperceptibly, he reverted to reducer mode. Team America was again in his sights. ‘I know what they will think when I hole that putt,’ Poulter murmured. ‘That I do know.’","Europe's Ian Poulter has won 12 of his last 13 Ryder Cup matches .

"Australian rock royalty Violent Soho cleaned up at an awards ceremony this week but because of stringent airline laws, almost didn't make it to the ceremony. The band attempted to board their Virgin Australia flight from Brisbane to Melbourne on Wednesday to head to the AIR Independent Music Awards, when guitarist James Tidswell was prevented from boarding. Tidswell, who with his band won Best Independent Album at the awards, was sporting a shirt emblazoned with the words 'Eat, S**t, Die'. James Tidswell, guitarist from Australian band Violent Soho, was prevented from boarding a Virgin Australia flight on Wednesday night for wearing this shirt . 'We almost didn't make it to the awards and I guess had I put my foot down as a human being living in a free country, we wouldn't have,' Tidswell said. Tidswell told Fairfax Media that a Virgin Airlines staff member asked him to remove the shirt due to new terrorism laws. The lyrics, from Painters and Docker’s 1990 classic single of the same name, was deemed a 'threat' by staff, who thought the shirt inappropriate. After turning the shirt inside out, Tidswell was allowed to board the flight with fellow band member Luke Henry. A photo of Tidswell wearing the shirt was posted to the band's Instagram account with the caption, '[James] wasn't allowed on the plane wearing his Painters and Dockers shirt - they claim he posed a threat.' Tidswell told Fairfax Media that a Virgin Australia staff member asked him to remove the shirt due to new terrorism laws. The band posted a follow up photo on their Instagram account of Tidswell shirtless and drinking a beer at Brisbane airport after the incident . The lyrics, from Painters and Docker’s 1990 classic single of the same name, was deemed a 'threat' by staff, who thought the shirt inappropriate. 'She was really apologetic and she was to some degree shaking, she just said she feels really bad having to ask but I am not going to be allowed on to the plane in the clothes I am wearing,' he said. 'I said ""are you sure?"" and she said, ""yes, definitely"" She said it was not a thing from the company but it involved the new laws due to terrorism, and with what is written on my shirt, I would be considered a threat.' However, a statement from Virgin claimed the ban was imposed because of the offence the shirt may have caused other passengers. 'A passenger on board flight VA326 from Brisbane to Melbourne was yesterday asked to cover a clothing item that could be considered to be offensive by other passengers,' the statement read. 'Under our terms of carriage, and consistent with many other airlines, passengers may not behave in a manner which would be considered to be offensive, or in a manner which might cause discomfort, distress, or offence to another person.' The band has a history of wearing clothing that pushes the boundaries . Violent Soho won Best Independent Album and Best Independent Hard Rock, Heavy or Punk Album at the Independent Music Awards and have been nominated for four ARIA awards. 'After complying with the request the passenger boarded and the flight left on time.' Tidswell said that he could not understand the reasoning behind the request, and that it seemed strange that by reversing his shirt he was suddenly no longer a threat. 'We almost didn't make it to the awards and I guess had I put my foot down as a human being living in a free country, we wouldn't have,' he said. The pair later made light of the incident, posting a photo of Tidswell in the airport, shirtless and drinking a beer, with the caption '[James] poses no threat. He just wants to have fun'. 'We took a photo of it because I couldn't believe it was possible to live in a time and place where that was the situation,' Tidswell told Fairfax.

"A cleaning mop was responsible for the flooding of a Qantas A380 cabin in July, an investigation has found. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has released its final report on the Qantas A380 flight that was flooded with 700 litres of water mid-flight. The incident, which happened on the 2nd of July, became apparent to the flight crew shortly after taking off. A river of water runs down the aisle of business class of the Qantas A380 jet . The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has released its final report on the Qantas A380 flight which was flooded in July . The  decision was made to turn flight QF94 back about an hour after take-off. A leaking water valve had released almost half of the drinkable water before the cabin crew managed to switch it off. The report said: 'The water had progressed through the upper deck floor and water was 'raining' on passengers in the vicinity of row 65 of the main deck. 'With the potable water supply switched off, there was no water available for the toilets or basins for the duration of the flight.' The captain chose to abandon the 14 hour flight and return to Los Angeles. The report said investigations uncovered that a cleaning mop was behind the incident. 'Initial engineering inspection found that the coupling that joins the water pipe at the floor level where the water supply enters the galley was unlatched. 'There was evidence that the rope-style mops used by cleaners may have contributed to the coupling coming undone.'

"A body found near a river south of Seattle, Washington is that of missing actress Misty Upham, who disappeared nearly two weeks ago after telling authorities she was suicidal, according to police. Upham, 32, a Native American actress who earned wide praise for her roles in movies including August: Osage County, Frozen River and Django Unchained, was last seen on October 5 near a relative's home in Auburn, Washington. The actress had returned to the Seattle-area to help care for her father, Charles Upham, who suffered a stroke last year. It was Misty's father Charles Upham who identified the lifeless body as his own daughter and told the authorities, reports US Weekly. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The dead body of Misty Upham, 32, who was missing since October 5, was found on Thursday . Shortly after her disappearance, Upham told KIRO-FM that his daughter was upset and erratic and had stopped taking medication for anxiety and bipolar disorder. Auburn police had responded to a suicide call at Misty Upham's residence in the days before she was last seen, authorities said. Her father previously said he did not believe she was suicidal. The identity of the body discovered Thursday near the White River, about 30 miles south of downtown Seattle, is confirmed as Misty Upham but the cause of death is still unknown. It took just over five hours to identify the body. The Hollywood Reporter spoke with Seattle-based filmmaker Tracy Rector who said that Misty Upham's uncle, Robert Upham, organized a search party to look for the missing actress three days ago. 'We waited at the site where the team found the body,' Rector told The Hollywood Reporter. 'It took about five-and-a-half hours to confirm. Then we gathered around her body to say prayers and now we're all gathered at the church.' Mr Upham told the MailOnline late Wednesday that he was frantic to find his daughter and felt that media attention had focused on her glamorous days on the red carpet and not her as a 'normal person.' He said the actress, a member of the Blackfoot tribe, had cut off her long locks before she went missing. He denied his daughter would ever go through with a suicide. He told KIRO-FM that Misty was in a 'psychotic' state when she left her house with only the clothes on her back and without her medication. 'It wasn't like she just decided to take time off,' he said. He added: 'She has said suicidal things in the past but never followed through,' he said. 'She doesn't believe in killing herself. She believes that is a sin and she would never do that.' Despair: Misty's father Charles (left) had been critical of the police search for his daughter. Police had received a suicide call to his home in Auburn, Washington. But when they arrived, she had disappeared . Where is Misty? Upham's parents had been canvassing their town and hanging 'missing' posters . Speaking to HollywoodLife.com, Mona Upham, Misty's mother, accused the Seattle area police of not doing enough to find her daughter. She attributed it to her Native-American background. 'I think if Misty was different-looking they would be doing a lot more to help find her,' she said. This was not the first time Upham has reportedly left her home without notice, and it is also not the first time police have responded to suicide calls at her residence. People magazine reported that in the last year, police have responded to Upham's apartment four times following suicide calls. Upham may have been under a lot of stress prior to her death. A source reportedly told People that Upham was struggling financially and sometimes had trouble paying her rent. Police received a suicide call on October 5, but when officers arrived, she was no longer at her father's house. A day later, her father went to the police asking that his daughter be listed as a 'missing and endangered person.' The police did not comply, saying that Upham's case did not meet the criteria because her disappearance was not 'unexplainable, involuntary or suspicious,' according to USA Today. Therefore, the Upham family took to Facebook and local media to alert the public about their missing daughter and to enlist the public's help in finding her. In a Facebook post on Upham's page, the family stated: 'We have been consumed by chasing down leads and doing ground searches in the area she was last seen. It is only her family searching right now, hanging posters, checking with shelters, hospitals, and asking people in the area if she has been seen. Upham is best known for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River,' for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. She recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County.' Her next onscreen role will be in 'Cake' with Jennifer Aniston and Anna Kendrick.

"A team of medical researchers are on their way to finding a cure for cancer after the discovery of a an amazing rainforest berry which holds cancer fighting properties. Scientists at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Queensland have used an experimental drug produced from the seeds of the rainforest plant, Blushwood tree (Hylandia Dockrillii), which exclusively grows in far north Queensland, to cure solid cancer tumours in pre-clinical trials. Already the drug has been used to successfully destroy or shrink tumours in pets and animals – including dogs, cats and horses and even Tasmanian Devils, while human trials are imminent. Blushwood (pictured) is the plant where the cancer fighting berries are sourced. Scientists from an experimental drug produced by the seeds of the plant have been used to cure cancer tumors in pre clinical trials . The study led by Dr Glen Boyle (pictured) found a single injection of the drug EBC-46 led to rapid breakdown of a range of tumors which could be effective in human patients . The study led by Dr Glen Boyle found a single injection of the drug EBC-46 led to rapid breakdown of a range of tumors which could be effective in human patients. 'We were able to achieve very strong results injecting EBC-46 directly into melanoma models, as well as cancers of the head, neck and colon,' said Dr Boyle. 'In most cases the single injection treatment caused the loss of viability of cancer cells within four hours, and ultimately destroyed the tumours.' Dr Boyle says EBC-46 works in part by triggering a cellular response which effectively cuts off the blood supply to the tumour. 'In more than 70 per cent of pre-clinical cases, the response and cure was long-term and enduring, with very little relapse over a period of 12 months.' Dr. Boyle also told ABC News about the use of several models of tumours. 'Including melanoma, head and neck cancer, colon, prostate cancer, and breast cancer, and it works very well in all of them. We're looking at around about a 75 per cent ablation rate,' he said. The QIMR building (pictured) Queensland Institute of Medical Research where the research has been done to find the cancer fighting berry from the Blushwood rainforest plant . He says the drug can start working instantly. 'There's a purpling of the area of the tumour itself, and you see that within five minutes. You come back the next day and the tumour is black, and come back a few days later and the tumour has fallen off.' Dr. Boyle has also described how the compound works in three ways, killing the tumor, cutting off blood supply and activating the body's immune system to clean up. EBC-46 (pictured) is the compound extracted from the berry of the Blushwood tree which is found in Far North Queensland . EBC-46 is a compound extracted from the fruit of the Blushwood tree which is found in north Queensland rainforests and has been known to have fast acting medicinal properties. Finding the wonder-berry can be difficult because the Blushwood is extremely particular about which conditions it will grow. But it was discovered by the Queensland biotechnology company EcoBiotics and is being developed as a human and veterinarian pharmaceutical through QBiotics. QBiotics is currently undertaking formal veterinary clinical trials in Australia and the USA while a final regulatory approval is still required for a human phase and clinical trial. 'The human trials planning is a work in progress,' said a QBiotics spokesman. 'They have not yet started trials.' Dr. Boyle says he is keen to pursue further research to see if this drug could be made more effective. 'We must stress at this point that EBC-46 will only be trialled in the short-term for tumours which can be accessed by direct injection or topical application,' Dr Boyle said. 'There is no evidence to suggest EBC-46 would be effective against metastatic cancers.'","Australian scientists on verge of cancer cure with cancer fighting berry .

"From misspelt quotes to curls of barbed wire and questionable portraits of celebrities, the recent history of tattooing hasn't always been a glorious one. But not every etching is a disaster and the tattoo hasn't always been a source of controversy. Indeed, as a new book reveals, in times past, the inking was a symbol of the sacred, the wealthy and the warlike. The earliest tattoos date from prehistoric times, with one of the earliest examples found on Ötzi the Iceman, a body thought to date from 3300 B.C discovered in a peat bog in the Ötztal Alps. Scroll down for video . Traditional: A modern Maori shows off his elaborate tribal tattoos in his Auckland home . But Ötzi and his clan certainly weren't alone. Ancient British tribes were also known for their love of tattoos, with the tribes north of the Scottish border earning themselves the Roman nickname Pict or 'painted man'. Tattooing has also long been part of Polynesian culture, while body art has been found on the mummified remains of Ancient Egyptian priests and priestesses. In the Americas too, body art has a long and often glorious history, and was used to denote belonging by Native Americans, while the ancient Aztecs and Incas used tattoos to mark priests and priestesses. But while tattoos have long been popular outside of Europe, it took until the Victorian period for body art to become popular in the UK once more. Changing times: A Peruvian 15th century pot in the shape of a tattooed man and artist Malick Sidibé (right) Scarification: Body art isn't only the work of tattooists. This Nigerian Bena woman has elaborate scar patterns . Popularised by 19th century explorers returning home to Britain full of tales about the weird and wonderful tattooed women they saw on their travels, tattoos swiftly became the accessory of choice for upper class women. Such was the intensity of the craze for body art during the Victorian period, even Queen Victoria is believed to have had one in the form of a Bengal tiger fighting with a python. Wartime Prime Minister, Winston Churchill's mother Jennie also had a serpent tattoo, although hers was rebelliously visible and inked bracelet style around her wrist. But it wasn't solely upper class Englishwomen who loved tattoos. As anthropologist Nicholas Thomas explains in Body Art, inkings also found new functions as the 19th and 20th centuries wore on, whether as a mark of imprisonment, as in Russia, or as a way of expressing creativity. Not every form of tattooing was harmless however. As the Victorian craze for body art developed, stories emerged of women being abducted and tattooed against their will before being press-ganged into work as circus attractions.

Standing out: A pair of  men make a statement with their tattoos during the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras . Striking: A man named Ali shows off his elaborate series of etchings in this 2007 Araminta de Clermont portrait . Despite the scandals, tattoos remained popular during the 1920s, but lost ground in the wake of the Great Depression and the Second World War. Left to languish in the fashion wilderness for nearly 40 years, the tattoo next staged a comeback in the 1970s, when they were claimed by the nascent feminist movement. Since then, tattoos have only become more popular, with an estimated 20 million British adults bearing at least one. Internationally, body art remains popular, whether as tribal markings such as the scarifications that mark some African tribes, or as a means of creative expression. Either way, tattoos might not be to everyone's taste but they certainly aren't going anywhere. Changing times: Modern tattooist Jack Mosher and an engraving of Polynesian chief dating from the 1500s . 3300 BC: Tattoos were common among the prehistoric peoples of Europe. Ötzi the Iceman, dated to 3300 BC, has 57 different etchings including a cross and six straight lines. An early ancestor of modern European man, the Iceman was found buried in a peat bog in the Ötztal Alps in 1991. 54 BC: The Picts or 'painted men' of Scotland struck terror into the hearts of invading Romans thanks to their scary blue woad tattoos. Julius Caesar also noted the presence of inked tribesmen in the British Isles in book five of his history of the Gallic Wars. 900 AD: Iraqi explorer, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, wrote that members of the Scandinavian Rus tribe (forerunners of the Vikings) were tattooed from 'fingernails to neck with dark blue tree patterns and other figures' during his travels around what is now Sweden. By this point, tattoos were becoming less common in the UK and elsewhere in Christian Europe, where they were seen as a mark of paganism. 1577: Although some of the England's Anglo-Saxon kings were believed to have sported tattoos, the next definitive sighting of body art came in 1577 when the explorer Sir Martin Frobisher returned from a voyage to the Arctic with three Inuit captives. The man, woman and child - all of whom bore tattoos - died within a month of arriving in London. 1691: Explorer William Dampier brought a tattooed native from New Guinea, who later became known as the 'Painted Prince'. 1776: Captain James Cook returned from a voyage to Polynesia bringing with him tales of the 'tattooed savages' he and his men had encountered. He also introduced the word 'tattoo' to the English language, which is itself derived from the Tahitian 'tatau'. 1892: The future King George V kick-starts the tattoo trend in Europe after he gets a Cross of Jerusalem tattoo while on a visit to the Middle East. His sons, the Duke of York and Clarence follow suit while on a naval tour of Japan. 1898: Another future British monarch, Edward VII, gets a tattoo and is swiftly copied by nearly every crowned head in Europe. Among the royal ink fans were Denmark's King Frederick IX, the King of Romania, Kaiser Wilhelm II, King Alexander of Yugoslavia and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. Even Queen Victoria was rumoured to have one. 1900: The first tattoo exhibition is held in London, kickstarting a trend for tattooed 'freaks' in contemporary travelling circuses . 1921: The first British female tattooist, Justine Knight, opens the doors to her London parlour . 1939: The outbreak of war in Europe precipitates a decline in the popularity of tattoos which continues throughout the 1940s. 50s and 60s . 1970: With the advent of the Women's Liberation movement, body art begins to become popular once more. 2014: Body etching has become part of mainstream culture, boasting celebrity fans ranging from Samantha Cameron to Cheryl Cole.

"Staples is looking into a 'potential' credit card data breach - in what could be the latest case of a mega retailer falling victim to hackers. The office supplier retailer said it has been in touch with law enforcement officials about the issue. It comes just over a week since Kmart joined an increasingly long line of retailers who have suffered massive credit card breaches this year, including Home Depot. Several banks had noticed fraud patterns suggesting some Northeast Staples stores could have been breached, according to security reporter Brian Krebs, who first revealed the potential breach. Latest victim: Staples is looking into a potential payment data breach, it has emerged. According to reports, fraudulent patterns have been noticed at Northeast stores, including ones in New Jersey and New York . He said that 'seven Staples stores in Pennsylvania, at least three in New York City, and another in New Jersey' had potentially been hit. There is no evidence that stores outside the Northeast have been affected, he said. It also wasn't immediately clear how many customers might have been affected. Staples had 1,800 stores across the country, but Krebs said the number affected was far smaller. The retailer said that if it turns up any data discrepancies during its investigation, customers won't be responsible for fraudulent activity on their credit cards as long as it is reported in a timely manner. Spokesman Mark Cautela said in a statement that 'we take the protection of customer information very seriously, and are working to resolve the situation'. Credit card breaches at retailers often occur after malware - malicious software - is attached to card payment terminals, which allows hackers to steal credit card numbers when the buyer swipes. Hacked? Credit card breaches at retailers occur after malware  is attached to card payment terminals. It is not yet clear how many - if any - customers have been affected. Pictured, a store in Brighton, Massachusetts . Earlier this month Sears Holdings Corp. reported a data breach at its Kmart stores. Other breaches have occurred at retailers including Target, Neiman Marcus, P.F. Chang's, Supervalu and Home Depot. At Home Deport, 56 million customer credit cards were put at risk of theft by data-stealing malware that had avoided detection. Target also suffered a huge hack last year, leaving the credit card data of 40 million customers - and personal information of 70 million more - exposed to fraudsters. In a bid to avoid such hacks, the government has called for a move to more secure chip-and-pin technology, encouraging stores to stop relying on magnetic strip payment cards. Shares of Staples Inc., based in Framingham, Massachusetts, slipped in pre-market trading Tuesday.","Banks have noticed fraud patterns suggesting some Northeast stores could have been breached, according to reports .

"Victoria Police have defended their investigation into a historic rape allegation made against Labour leader Bill Shorten after the woman who claimed she was attacked accused them of 'failing her'. A month after Mr Shorten publicly dismissed rape claims against him as 'untrue and abhorrent' and Victoria Police found no case to answer, the woman who claimed she was raped by him in 1986 has waived her right to anonymity and accused the force of not investigating her allegations properly. The woman named Kathy, who agreed to be named and pictured by the Herald Sun, has claimed Victoria Police failed to locate witnesses after she handed them a 19-page statement detailing the alleged incident on October 23 last year. However, a spokesperson for Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia: 'The matter has been investigated as would any allegation of sexual assault. 'Investigating police sought advice from the Office of Public Prosecutions which advised them there was no reasonable prospect of conviction.' Scroll down for video . The woman named Kathy, who agreed to be named and pictured by the Herald Sun, has accused Victoria Police of failing to properly investigate . Kathy, 44, told the newspaper: 'I don’t think I had a hope in hell with the police because of who he is. 'If Bill was just a regular guy I think it would have been different.' A spokesperson for Mr Shorten told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday: 'Bill doesn't have anything else to say, we refer you to his statement on August 21. He said he won't be making any more comments.' Deputy Labour leader Tanya Plibersek said in a press conference on Thursday, when asked about the woman's claims, that the allegations were 'thoroughly investigated by the police'. 'Bill Shorten cooperated fully, and that should be an end to the matter,' she added. The Victoria Police spokesperson added that anyone who has concerns about the manner in which the investigation was conducted can contact the 'professional standards command or independent broad-based anti-corruption commission.' Kathy alleges she was raped during a Young Labor conference in Portarlington, near Geelong, Victoria, in the winter of 1986 after she had previously spoken to Mr Shorten about policy issues on the phone. She claims the MP raped her in a bathroom in the early hours after a group came back to the camp after going out for a drive. She said she gave the police three main witnesses, including the phone number of one and her maiden and married name, when she reported the crime. She  alleges police failed to find the witnesses. On August 21, Mr Shorten released a brief statement in Melbourne which confirmed police had dropped their investigation into the claims. 'I will not go into the details, except to say that the allegation was untrue and abhorrent,' Mr Shorten said at a press conference. On August 21, Mr Shorten  confirmed police had dropped their investigation into the claims . Mr Shorten revealed the investigation had been difficult for he and his wife Chloe Bryce, the daughter of former Governor-General Quentin Bryce. 'This has been deeply distressing for my family,' he added. 'I'm thankful for the love and support of Chloe and the support of my staff and parliamentary colleagues.' The alleged victim made claims on Facebook last year that she was assaulted at a Young Labor camp near Geelong in 1986. 'Investigating police sought advice from the Office of Public Prosecutions, which advised there was no reasonable prospect of conviction,' read a statement from Victoria Police. Kathy made claims on Facebook last year that she was assaulted at a Young Labor camp near Geelong in 1986 . Mr Shorten said 'there is absolutely no basis for the claim' during a brief statement . 'All parties have been notified that Victoria Police will not be proceeding with criminal charges.' Richard Marles, the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and a longtime friend of Mr Shorten, told 2GB at the time that it had been 'one of the worst moments of Bill's life'. 'I first met Bill in 1987 and I have been a close friend of Bill since that time. I know that these allegations are not true, because the person I've known is simply not capable of undertaking the allegations that have been made against him,' he told Ben Fordham on his radio program on 2GB. 'I have no idea what the motivations are behind the allegations that have been made. 'There's just no way that any of this was possible. These allegations surface almost immediately upon Bill becoming the leader of the Labor Party. 'It's been a really difficult time for Bill. I think this has been one of the worst moments of Bill's life. I think with this being dealt with in the background shows how tough a guy he is.' Late last year I learned that a claim had been made about me, going back to when I was nineteen. It was made on social media, when I was elected Opposition Leader. I will not go into details, except to say that the allegation was untrue and abhorrent. The allegation was made by someone I knew briefly at that time. There is absolutely no basis for the claim. The claim has now been thoroughly and rigorously investigated by police, as is entirely proper. I fully cooperated to clear my name. And that is what I have done. I freely answered all questions the police asked of me. Now the police investigation has concluded, I can make this statement. This has been deeply distressing for my family. I am thankful for the love and support of Chloe, and the support of my staff and parliamentary colleagues. Others who were aware of the investigation have acted with the utmost integrity by leaving the police to do their job. The police have now concluded the investigation. The decision speaks for itself.

"That was a massive statement by England in Auckland, very encouraging indeed, but they need to start preparing immediately for a massive backlash from the All Blacks next week. The gloves are off. England can bring their A game and their A team into next week’s game but so can New Zealand. New Zealand looked flat and a little uninspired for parts on Saturday. It’s not easy playing your first game in six months with everyone expecting you to win by a cricket score - but they will be in top gear from the off next week. Proud: England's players fought valiantly but were defeated by New Zealand in Auckland . England need to keep their feet firmly on the ground because it will be a ‘different’ New Zealand in Dunedin. And to counter that Stuart Lancaster will need a ‘different’ England team to match them. The facts are England did not score a try and lost the game and they must improve by some margin to come away with a win. The good news is that because of the schedule England are in the unusual position of having a lot of cards to play in the second Test. Traditionally New Zealand can splutter a little in their opening Test of a home series before getting their act together and routing the opposition. They always gather momentum and sharpen up their game. Stepping up: Freddie Burns was one of several fringe players who impressed against New Zealand . This time though England have some big-time players to reintroduce to the team and add momentum. Despite some fine performances by the stand-ins - Freddie Burns, Ben Morgan, Kyle Eastmond, James Haskell, Rob Webber, Geoff Parling - England must go with their First XV, as close to the team that finished the Six Nations as possible. The one thing England must not be thinking, even subconsciously this week, is that they are in a good place. They need to stay sharp and on edge. The reality is that they are 1-0 down and will be facing a New Zealand team who will improve by at least 50 per cent. But England can reach another level as well. The performances from the guys who stepped in yesterday add considerably to England’s strength in depth but now is the time for Tom Wood, Owen Farrell, Courtney Lawes, Luther Burrell, Dylan Hartley and Billy Vunipola to return, and Danny Care as well if he has recovered. England have an opportunity to achieve something very special down in the ‘glasshouse’ but the gun needs to be fully loaded, England need to fire all their shots. Physical: England went toe to toe with New Zealand on their own back yard in Auckland . It could be a fantastic spectacle and if England can win, if they can return home later this month with one Test win, it will be a huge boost to their World Cup prospects. As for yesterday I’m not sure who the official man of the match was but England skipper Chris Robshaw was magnificent. It’s not often you see Richie McCaw so anonymous in a game. I can’t recall any turnovers from the New Zealand skipper or forcing penalties, which is normally his forte. McCaw might have been just suffering from New Zealand’s general malaise but England’s directness and physicality at the breakdown helped negate him on Saturday. Part of me still wants to see Robshaw at blindside in a big match - he could be phenomenal there - but it won’t happen on this tour. It can only happen if England have a world-class seven to slot in. They do - but Steffon Armitage was playing for the World XV against the Boks on Saturday! Close: England skipper Chris Robshaw looks dejected after his team's narrow defeat . Decisions: England coach Stuart Lancaster will have some selection choices to make in Dunedin .","England laid down a huge marker against New Zealand despite being beaten .

"Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies today admitted Ebola keeps her awake at night, adding she is worried the virus will reach UK shores . Britain's chief medical officer today admitted Ebola keeps her awake at night, adding she is worried the deadly virus will reach UK shores. But Dame Sally Davies added reassurance, while she is concerned about the disease reaching Britain, she is confident it will not spread. She told BBC Radio 4's Life Scientific programme the country is well prepared in the event of a case being diagnosed in a British hospital. 'This is a tragedy for the people of West Africa, it is at the moment, out of control and people are dying, the dead are left in the street,' she said. 'Clearly I worry about it coming in to Britain, but that is not a worry it will spread. 'We have superb services that have done a lot of preparation. 'We have excellent contact tracing and our infectious disease services are second to none. 'But we have to be vigilant and make sure every part of the NHS picks people up, protects them and looks after them. 'Meanwhile I am very proud of this Government and what they are doing in Sierra Leone where we are leading the fight, while the US leads in Liberia and France focuses on Guinea. 'It is a really good start.' Two weeks ago Dame Davies told MPs that all health service chiefs had been asked to confirm that steps had been taken to ensure isolation rooms were available and staff knew how to react should an Ebola victim walk into a hospital. She sought to play down the threat to the UK, insisting the present evidence suggests no more than a handful of cases. And she dismissed reports the virus could be transmissible through the air. Addressing the Commons health select committee, Dame Davies said emergency exercises carried out across the NHS have shown preparations were going 'rather better than I dared hope'. She told MPs she shared their concerns about the level of preparedness across the health service but said she was reassured by Public Health England that efforts were on track. Scroll down for video . An NHS staff worker wears a full-body protective suit to wheel the actor into quarantine in Newcastle. Calls to the non-emergency 111 phoneline will now be screened for suspected Ebola cases . In this exercise, an actor visited a walk-in health centre in Hillingdon, pictured, to report flu-like symptoms. He told workers that he had recently been travelling in west Africa . A vaccine to protect millions from the Ebola virus decades after it was first detected does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor African nations. The head of the World Health Organisation's scathing conclusion came as nearly 5,000 people have lost their lives to the hemorrhagic fever - the majority in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan addressed the regional committee for Africa in Benin . Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO, criticised drugs companies for turning their backs on 'markets that cannot pay'. She said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two WHO arguments 'that have fallen on deaf ears for decades'. Addressing the regional committee for Africa in Benin yesterday, Dr Chan said: 'Ebola emerged nearly four decades ago. Why are clinicians still empty handed, with no vaccines and no cure? 'Because Ebola has historically been confined to poor African nations. 'The R&D (research and development) incentive is virtually non-existent. 'A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay. 'WHO has been trying to make this issue visible for ages. Now people can see it for themselves.' 'A lot of work is going on. It is improving day by day. There is more work to be done,' she said. 'Every casualty is now working to develop an isolation room and make sure their personal protection equipment is handy and there is work ongoing to ensure that people are trained in its use.' She went on: 'Remember how low the risk is: if they have started now and it happens in the next week or so that should be satisfactory. 'NHS England have today sent a letter to every chief executive in the NHS with a checklist for assurance purposes asking them to sign that off.' 'I share your concern. What I have heard last night and this morning makes me think we are well on the way to the best place we could be.' Committee chair Sarah Wollaston - a GP - said one accident and emergency doctor had contacted her to say that he was not even aware of where protective clothing was kept. Dame Sally said all staff, and not just clinicians, needed to be made aware. 'I think they should know where it is and how to put it on and - more importantly - how to take it off, but actually to have agreed who would be the first to do it because not everyone would need to. 'The first response is ""hello, ah, if you may have Ebola, I would like you to sit in this room, here is a glass of water and I am shutting the door while I call in some experts and we make sure we know what we do"".' 'They need to raise their awareness and it would be very good for infection control generally. Dame Sally claimed she was ' not sleeping because we are working so hard' to deal with the threat of Ebola. There were at present 12 specialist beds available, she said, but more could easily be added if required. 'I'm sure that if we had to we could open Ebola wards.' She repeatedly sought to reassure the public over reports that the virus could mutate to a strain that could be spread in the air not, as at present, only via bodily fluids. Analysis by experts at the Government's Porton Down laboratories had found 'no suggestion' it was on such a course, she said.","Dame Sally Davies said Ebola is the health issue keeping her up at night .

"A grieving mother is pleading for the return of her stolen pendant - which contain's her son's ashes. Gaynor Augustine, 63, was left devastated when she realised her home had been burgled on October 10 and the cruel thieves took her necklace. Her son Spencer Carter died at the age of 43 last year after suffering a heart attack, and Gaynor had the pendant made especially as a unique reminder of him. Gaynor Augustine is pleading with burglars to return a pendant which was stolen from her home in Kent as it contains the remains of her son Spencer Carter, who died of a heart attack last year aged just 43 . She is pleading with whoever stole the hear-shaped necklace to come forward and return it, as she says the jewellery is 'irreplaceable'. Mrs Augustine, of Cuxton, Kent, said: 'I watched the jeweller put Spencer's ashes in it. 'It took him over an hour to do and the pendant was sealed afterwards, so no one will know the ashes are in there if they sell it. 'They are my son's ashes and thinking of them being around the neck of someone else is just so upsetting. 'I came home at about 9.10pm and could see a light shining in the kitchen so I think I disturbed them and when I got inside I discovered I'd been burgled. 'The pendant is irreplaceable and I just want it back. I am hoping someone will do the decent thing and hand it in.' Kent Police say they are investigating the burglary. DC Craig Hewitt, of Kent Police, said: 'This was one of two burglaries in the area that night, and the woman victim in this case was particularly upset because the pendant contained her son's ashes. 'We have carried out inquiries in the local area, and my colleagues have visited a number of second-hand stores and pawnbrokers in case the item has been put up for sale.'","Gaynor Augustine's house in Cuxton, Kent was burgled on October 10 .

"After a night of celebrating the South Sydney Rabbitohs' first premiership win in 43 years, Russell Crowe took to Twitter to blast the CEO of the team's major sponsor, calling him a 'pelican'. Crowe's rage is said to have come after he noticed a newspaper report that claimed Chief Executive Officer of Crown Resorts Rowen Craigie backed rival team the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs to win the grand final. Crowe took to Twitter at around 6am on Monday to attack his  billionaire mate James Packer's staff member. 'Rowen Craigie needs to start looking for another job. You pelican,' the Gladiators star wrote. But it seems his quick temper may have caused him to react too soon. Scroll down for video . Couldn't be prouder: Russell Crowe was elated as his beloved South Sydney Rabbitohs won their first premiership in 43 years against the Bulldogs at ANZ Stadium in Sydney on Sunday night . Russell Crowe sent this cryptic tweet at around 6am on Monday morning . The Financial Review reports that Craigie was misquoted when he appeared to back the Bulldogs to win. Craigie allegedly told The Daily Telegraph’s business columnist Scott Rochfort: 'This is going to be a repeat of the Sydney Hawthorn upset. So we’re going to see two in two weeks.' However, Craigie told Daily Mail Australia: 'I was barracking for South on the night and all of us at Crown are delighted about the Grand Final result. 'Comments I made before the match about a Canterbury upset were just a reference to a possible upset given Hawthorn's victory over the Swan's last week in the AFL.' On Sunday 50-year-old Crowe was seen whooping and cheering as the 80,000 strong crowd erupted into jubilation following a history-making performance by the team. Mr Craigie (centre) is the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Crown Resorts, working alongside boss James Packer (left). Crown resorts are the major sponsors of the Rabbitohs . He broke into a grin and threw his hands up in the air when the Rabbitohs beat the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 30-6 at Sydney's ANZ Stadium. Crowe is close friends with the Crown Resort's chairman Packer and the company's logo features on the team's jerseys. Following the win, Russell hailed the contribution of his players and staff, and said it was a night he would never forget. 'I would say it's a pretty good night,' Crowe said. 'There's deep deep satisfaction, this is a team sport and there has been a lot of people involved over the last nine years and a lot of effort gone in. Pleased: Wearing his Souths jacket, the Gladiator star grinned as he watched on with pride after the win . Glory, glory to South Sydney! The 50-year-old took over the club in 2006 and is credited with restoring it to its former glory, turning around years at the bottom of the ladder to a premiership win . Crowe also tweeted the results of the game to his 1.58 million followers . He broke into a grin and threw his hands up in the air when the Rabbitohs beat the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 30-6 at Sydney's ANZ Stadium . 'It's a grand reward for those who stepped up to the plate and said we weren't to put up with Souths being a losing club any more.' Crowe hailed the impact Sam Burgess has had on the club since his arrival in 2010 with the rugby-bound Englishman winning the Clive Churchill Medal despite playing the whole game with a shattered cheekbone. 'I met him he was 20 years old and he had this ambition and I noticed what that level of ambition was,' he said. Tense: The actor wasn't so relaxed when he was seen before the game kicked off . Elated: The Noah star couldn't hide his joy as he was interviewed after the game . 'I call him the sparkly-eyed man. He can be hard as he wants on the football field but gracious off of it. 'He's carved his name deep in the history of rugby league.' Crowe helped restore the club to being one the the game's superpowers 12 years after they were readmitted back into the competition. Since being readmitted, they remained largely at the bottom of the ladder until 2007 when they made the semi-finals for the first time sine 1989. Sunday night was the first time the Rabbitohs have played the grand final in 43 years. Historic moment: The Rabbitohs were jubilant as they posed for a team photo with their hard-earned trophy .

"A Nigerian drug mule has died in a Spanish airport after cocaine bags inside his body split open - because airport staff refused to touch him fearing he had Ebola.

'Medical staff decided immediately that there was a risk that this could be a case of Ebola.' The man was left shivering on the airport floor after the bags burst inside him and it took an hour before it could be established that the man was dying (stock image) It later transpired that the man was suffering the effects of a cocaine overdose after several bags of the drug burst in his stomach. A passenger accompanying the Nigerian later told police that he had flown from Madrid to Istanbul on October 14 and had not been to Nigeria for four years.

"Telling of public executions, hard labour and starvation, four survivors of North Korean prison camps have shared their shocking stories of life in the country’s gulags. Kim Young Soon spent nine years in Yodok prison camp along with her elderly parents and four young children, for gossiping about an affair her friend had with Kim Jong Il. ‘It is a place that would make your hair stand on end,’ she said in a video released by Amnesty International today. Scroll down for video . Kim Young Soon spent nine years in Yodok prison camp for gossiping about an affair her friend had with Kim Jong Il. Her parents and four young children were imprisoned with her and all of them died in the camp . Satellite images of the Yodok prison camp in North Korea. An estimated 200,000 peopled are interred in prison camps throughout the country . Ms Kim’s elderly parents and four children, aged nine, seven, four and one, were also sent to the prison camps for her alleged crime. They all died from starvation and hard labour. ‘When my parents starved to death, I didn’t have coffins for them. I wrapped their bodies in straw, carried them on my back and went to bury them myself. And the children… I lost all my family,’ she said. A former prison guard, speaking anonymously to Amnesty, said that this strategy, called 'guilt-by-association' was implemented to fulfil the aim of ‘exterminating the three generations of a family.’ The guard also revealed how officials would rape women from the camp and then kill them. He spoke of the two execution methods used by prison officers to kill inmates. The first involved getting them to dig their own grave and then hitting them in the back of the head with a small metal hammer. The other method involved strangulation with a rubber rope. More than 200,000 people are believed to be held in North Korean prison camps, according to independent estimates. The video comes as the United Nations today releases their findings on human rights violations in North Korea. The United Nations Commission of Inquiry on human rights in North Korea was set up last March to investigate 11 different areas, including food deprivation, torture, executions, and religious persecution. Michael Kirby, chairman of the inquiry, said that inmates in North Korea’s prison camps suffered ‘unspeakable atrocities’, comparable to the treatment of prisoners by the Nazis during the Second World War. ‘The entire body of evidence gathered so far points to what appear to be large-scale patterns of systematic and gross human rights violations,’ Justice Kirby, a former judge of Australia's High Court, told the U.N. General Assembly's human rights committee last October. Camp: Conditions at North Korean prison camps are brutal, with endless tales of starvation and executions . Labour: One former prisoner says pregnant women were forced to do strenuous labour to force miscarriages . 'You are haunted by the nightmarish image in dreams': Joo Il-Kim, a former military captain spoke about witnessing public executions in North Korea . Park Ji-hyun was sent to a prison camp  after she attempted to escape from a Chinese farmer to whom she had been sold . A former prison guard speaks anonymously to Amnesty International about the atrocities that are committed in the prisons of North Korea . Another survivor who shared her testimony in the Amnesty International video was Park Ji-hyun. She was sent to a prison camp in Onsung, after she attempted to escape from a Chinese farmer to whom she had been sold. She told of the horrific treatment of women in the camp, all of whom were forced to take a pregnancy test upon arrival at the camp. ‘They would force abortion after the pregnancy test,’ Ms Park said. ‘Pregnant women get sent to labour camps to carry loads up and down the hills which cause miscarriages.’ Many detainees in these camps die of hard labour. Ms Park said that women were forced to function as livestock, pulling carts laden with a tonne of soil. ‘We couldn’t do this at a walking pace either. We had to run,’ she said. Those in the camps would often have to labour from 4:30am until dark, and then attend meetings until midnight. Joo Il-Kim, a former military captain, talked of the starvation rife throughout the country. Starvation is such a problem that prisoners would resort to eating animal feed, or even beans and maize kernels stuck in animal dung. Isolation: North Korea's prisons are so isolated it's hard to get a grasp of the endless atrocities that occur within their walls . Starved: North Koreans sometimes resort to eating undigested food found in animal feces . ‘I saw piles of bodies [of people] who have died from starvation in public places,’ said Mr Joo. The former captain also describes the practice of public executions, which he alleges is common in the closed country. ‘People scream in horror at this sight. The crowd roars. It is so gruesome, you instinctively close your eyes or turn your head away… When all the gunshots have died down, you look and the body is heaped onto the ground. You cannot sleep after witnessing it. You are haunted by the nightmarish image in dreams,’ he said. The United Nations has stated its hope that the year-long investigation, which involved speaking to North Korean exiles in Seoul, Tokyo, London and Washington, might pave the way for criminal prosecution. But survivors who provided testimony to the U.N. panel are sceptical that the report will have any effect on the regime. Slave labor: Prisoners are often forced to work from sunrise to sundown and are forced to attend 'meetings' until after midnight . March: Laborers are often forced to walk 12 to 14 miles to work plowing fields . Attempts at prosecution are likely to be blocked by China, North Korea’s closest ally. North Korea calls any criticism of its human rights record a U.S.-led conspiracy. Mr Joo, the former military captain featured in the Amnesty International video says that despite the challenges of ending the alleged human rights violations, the only hope for the country is that stories of such atrocities need to be told. ‘People in the UK and the international community should know the reality of North Korea. Once you know what the reality is, the voice to improve the situation in North Korea can follow,’ he said.","Video by Amnesty International on conditions in Nth Korean prisons .

"He would never have got a white Christmas here. But with a pool, spa, home movie theater, retractable glass walls, and acres of land, acclaimed singer Bing Crosby can't have minded too much. His 7,000-square-foot ranch in Rancho Mirage, California, was a go-to party house for the elite of the 1950s - and allegedly played host to a liaison between JFK and Marilyn Monroe. Scroll down for video . Incredible: The mountains in Rancho Mirage, California, tower over this sprawling bungalow that was home to Bing Crosby and is now on the market for $5 million . Spell-binding: The idyllic ranch will not have seen a white Christmas but the regal, pillared building and luscious green land will have been a pretty enough picture . Master suite: Complete with a fireplace, desk, three armchairs, and floor-to-ceiling windows, this 1,400-square-foot bedroom is more like a luxurious lounge area . Grandeur: The living room has concrete-slabbed flooring and exposed brick, with retractable glass walls that open out to the swimming pool overlooking the valley . Decades later, it masqueraded as a holiday home for the Obamas one summer, sparking rumors the first couple wanted to buy the sprawling property. Now, it could be yours... for a cool $5 million. The gated home, built in the 1950s for Academy Award-winning Crosby, boasts a 1,400-square-foot master bedroom, two guest rooms, and a two-bed casita attached, with its own kitchen and private entrance. The bespoke kitchen, equipped for professional chefs, is reached via hand-craft Moroccan doors. High class: Academy Award-winning singer Bing Crosby (left), who sang White Christmas, lived there, and President Obama is said to have spend a summer there . Secret hideaway? President John F Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe are said to have had a secret liaison in the home potentially during one of the glitzy parties thrown there . Character: Bing Crosby had the home specifically designed to cater for his taste in Moroccan wood design, like this bespoke door that shrouds one of three bedrooms . State-of-the-art: The kitchen has been fitted with the latest technology ideal for a professional chef - or to make amateur cooking feel that bit more sophisticated . Long day? Would-be buyers can look forward to kicking back in the turbo-powered Jacuzzi that looks out onto an annexed garden with stone walls . The silver screen: Bing Crosby fans will delight in the film posters featuring the home's previous owner in this home movie theater that could seat around 10 people . Guest room: Guests not only have a sizable room and bed but they also get an entire living space with a table and seating for four of their own guests . Any more for any more? If the previous bedrooms weren't enough, there's also a casita attached to the building with two further rooms and its own kitchen space . Hand-made: These Moroccan doors were hand-carved for the property near Palm Springs and Coachella Valley, where presidents have played golf for years . In the bathroom-cum-spa, the future owner can look forward to dips in the turbo-powered Jacuzzi. The living area has a wet bar that no-doubt will have come in handy at Crosby's soirees. Walk through sliding glass doors to the outdoor pool and you are met with a panoramic view of the Coachella Valley. Would-be buyers who feel that's not enough will be relieved to hear there is a parcel of land next door that comes with the property for 'extra privacy' or 'future expansion'. This living room and kitchen of the adjacent casita, with a Marilyn Monroe poster on the wall, could be where JFK and Marilyn were said to have engaged in their liaison . Bathroom: The glass-walled shower comes with a stall inside, and the sinks are marble-topped . And for any die-hard Bing Crosby fans looking to follow in his footsteps, the walls are currently decked out in photos and posters of the crooner. On sale with Sotheby's International, it is slated to garner a flurry of attention despite fears of uncertainty in the property market. It was last put on the market for $3.5 million - 43 per cent lower than its going rate today - but after a recent surge in neighbor's house prices, the current owner had a re-think.","Bing Crosby's ranch in Rancho Mirage, California, has a pool, spa, home movie theater, and second house .

"Argentinian tenor Marcelo Zelada was left red-faced after he forgot the words to Australia's national anthem while he was singing it at a Rugby Union Championships match. The singer could only remember the first line of Advance Australia Fair in full before he stumble his way through the rest of the song, much to the amusement of the Wallabies.

The singer boldly continued but was only able to get a spattering of words correct and mumbled gibberish in place of the ones he did not remember before some of the Wallabies started to realise Zelada's shortcomings. The team push on singing the tune proudly but not without suppressing their laughter at the situation. Video footage shows the moment players - including Israel Folau and Adam Ashley Cooper - try unsuccessfully to hide their amusement.

"A Melbourne-based artist is facing an expensive legal battle after she discovered overseas online fashion retailers were selling clothing featuring her stolen illustrations. Kelly Thompson, 32, said a tip-off from a Facebook fan revealed websites Choies.com and Sheinside.com were advertising dresses, long-sleeve T-shirts and skirts with three of her drawings printed on them. Ms Thompson complained to Choies and requested compensation for the use of her artwork but all she was offered was a $30 voucher. Kelly Thompson, 32, says overseas online fashion retailers sold clothes featuring her stolen illustrations . The Melbourne-based artist complained to Choies and requested compensation for the breach of copyright but all she was offered was a $30 voucher . The artist, who lives in Abbotsford, said the offer was insulting considering the items featuring her designs sold for between $31.49 and $34.99. 'It's so rude, I think I actually laughed when I first read it,' she said. 'They obviously don't take it seriously at all – as if I would want to spend money on their website after all this.' She has discovered that the items were sold to Choies via a third party manufacturer, who has sold them to other retailers, meaning she faces the costly task of tracking the manufacturer down and hiring a lawyer to try to claim damages. Ms Thompson said she is worried the websites have devalued her designs, which she would usually sell for thousands of dollars. Ms Thompson said the offer was insulting because the items featuring her designs sold for more than $31.49 .

'Someone is supplying these clothes to all these  websites, my work could be all over the place. 'Now I have to find a lawyer and try to get it chased down.' Ms Thompson was first alerted to the clothing items on September 17 by someone who likes her page on Facebook. '[They] sent me a message and a link to the image of the dress, it was just one at the time, and then I contacted Choies and they took it down,' Ms Thompson said. 'They didn't reply they just took it down.' On September 23, she noticed the same print again on two long-sleeve T-shirts, so she sent a follow-up email requesting compensation and demanding they destroy all garments in stock. Ms Thompson has also seen her drawings featured on a skirt for sale on Sheinside.com, but emails to the company have gone unanswered . A representative from the Choies customer service department told Ms Thompson: 'We are really sorry for the troubles we have caused to you. 'For the items you mentioned, we will remove all of them out of our site and will severely deal with the manufacturer and break up the partnership with our supplier.' After Ms Thompson sent follow-up emails to try to finalise a compensation amount, she was offered a $30 gift voucher. The initial cost of sending legal letters to the manufacturers will cost Ms Thompson at least $2500. Ms Thompson has also seen her drawings featured on a skirt for sale on Sheinside.com, but she said emails to the company have gone unanswered.

"Paym has the the potential to eventually link up every current account in the country with a phone number so transferring cash is as easy as texting (pictured) Transferring money to friends and family has got considerably easier since the days when writing cheques was the only option, but until now it still required knowledge of people’s bank details. A new mobile payment service is set to make life easier as it has the potential to eventually link up every current account in the country with a phone number. The Paym service has just launched and is initially available for use by 30million people in the UK. It enables people to transfer money by using mobile phone numbers and can be used by customers of the Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Cumberland Building Society, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Santander, TSB and Danske Bank. By the end of the year, a total of 40 million people will be able to access Paym, when Clydesdale Bank, first direct, Isle of Man Bank, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Yorkshire Bank come on board. By that point, Paym will be available on more than nine out of 10 current accounts. Paym, which is pronounced as ‘pay em’, has been described as the first industry-wide collaboration in the UK, which could potentially link up every bank account with a mobile number. Although it is anticipated that many people will use Paym to make small payments to friends and family, they will be able to transfer at least £250 a day under the scheme if they want. Some banks and building societies will have a higher daily limit. People need to actively register their mobile number alongside a nominated current account in order to receive money into that account through Paym. Scroll down for video . The service has just launched and is initially available for use by 30 million people in the UK. It enables people to transfer money just by using mobile phone numbers and can be used by customers of the Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Cumberland Building Society, Halifax, HSBC (pictured) Lloyds Bank, Santander, TSB and Danske Bank . Register your mobile number and the current account you would like your payments made into. Your friends can then pay money directly into your current account using just your phone number - without a sort code or account number. The service can be accessed using an updated version of current baking apps. Upon sending money, you will be asked to confirm the name of the recipient, check the amount and press send. The person making the payment will receive notification that the payment has been sent and the receiver will see the money in their account. At launch, customers of the Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Cumberland Building Society, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Santander, TSB and Danske Bank will be able to use the service. By the end of last week, more than 300,000 people had already registered to be able to use the service. People do not have to register for Paym in order to send money through the service, although their bank or building society does need to be taking part in the scheme in order for them to do this. The service will allow people to transfer cash payments on their mobile by using the recipient's phone number rather than needing to know their bank account number and sort code. It will be integrated into their existing mobile banking or payment app. To make a payment, a user can either select the contact they wish to pay from their phone or key in their mobile number. The app will ask them to confirm the name of the recipient and the amount before the money is sent. Adrian Kamellard, chief executive of the Payments Council, which is overseeing the initiative, said: ‘Paying someone back just got easier for millions of people. Paym is another safe and easy option to pay friends and family.’ Payments made through the service are made at the same speeds as existing current account, online and mobile payment services.

The service is initially available to 30million people in the UK but by the end of the year that number will rise to 40million. Paym will then be available on more than nine out of 10 current accounts. Paym, which is pronounced as ‘pay em’, has been described as the first industry-wide collaboration in the UK, which could potentially link up every bank account with a mobile number. Payments made through the service are made at the same speeds as existing current account, online and mobile payment services. Around £1billion payments are expected to be made using Paym by 2018. Some commentators have predicted this will mark the end for cash, cheques and high street banks. More than 94 per cent of adults now own a mobile phone and strong growth in mobile payments technology has already made it easier for people to leave their wallets at home. Barclays' Pingit app, which launched just before the 2012 Olympic Games, picked up 2.5 million regular users in just 18 months. Pingit, which is available to both Barclays and non-Barclays customers, also allows people to make payments using just mobile phone numbers. Another mobile payments scheme called Zapp is set to launch this autumn and is backed by the company behind Link cash machines. Nationwide . Building Society has confirmed its intention to join the Paym scheme in . early 2015 while Metro Bank and Ulster Bank are also finalising their . launch plans. Last . week, the Payments Council announced that people who accidentally send . money to the wrong bank account will be able to get better help in . clawing it back by the end of next month. A new voluntary code will mean that people get quicker and more consistent help from their bank or building society after they have alerted them to a wrong payment, although someone who raises such a claim is not guaranteed they will get their money back.

"Nadal won 6-4 6-3 as he bids to win his second successive Madrid Open . Nadal will face either David Ferrer or Kei Nishikori in Sunday's final . Bautista will break into the top 30 for the first time thanks to his tournament run . Rafa Nadal continued his serene progress in pursuit of consecutive Madrid Open crowns when he swept past Spanish compatriot Roberto Bautista 6-4 6-3 on Saturday to reach the final. The world number one, chasing a 63rd career title and a 44th on clay, has not been on top form on his favoured surface this year, losing in the quarter-finals in Monte Carlo and Barcelona. However, he has shown glimpses of his dominant best in front of adoring fans in the Spanish capital, where he is yet to drop a set, as he warms up for a tilt at a record-extending ninth French Open title starting at Roland Garros in Paris at the end of the month. Victor: Rafael Nadal is through to the Madrid Open final after beating Roberto Bautista 6-4 6-3 on Saturday . Nadal's semi-final victory against the unheralded Bautista ended the world number 45's best run at a Masters event and set up a clash on Sunday with either another Spaniard, fifth seed David Ferrer, who beat him in the Monte Carlo quarter-finals, or Japanese 10th seed Kei Nishikori. Nadal said his performance was further confirmation of his improving form after Friday's fine win against sixth-ranked Czech Tomas Berdych in the last eight. 'After I think a great match yesterday, to have the confirmation today that the improvement is real is very good news for me,' he told a news conference. All-time high: Bautista will break into the world's top 30 for the first time after reaching the Madrid Open semis . 'And being in a final here in a difficult tournament at home after losing two weeks in a row in the quarter-finals means a lot to me,' added the 27-year-old Majorcan, who was also champion in Madrid in 2010 and in 2005 when it was an indoor hard court event. 'This is great news in order to go out and play tomorrow's match but also for what may come in the future.' Nadal broke Bautista's serve in the opening game at the Magic Box arena but his gutsy compatriot fought back to level at 3-3 before immediately losing his serve again. Bautista looked to have crumbled in the face of a barrage of fierce Nadal drives in the second set but raised his game to break for 4-2. Nadal, who will be contesting his 90th career final on Sunday, broke serve for a fifth time in the ninth game and sealed victory on his first match point with a rasping forehand down the line. Bautista will break into the top 30 for the first time thanks to his performance in Madrid. Final opponents: Nadal will face either David Ferrer (left) or Kei Nishikori (right) in Sunday's showpiece . He upset Argentine Juan Martin del Potro at this year's Australian Open and claimed a second top-10 scalp of the season when he beat Berdych in the second round at the Indian Wells Masters event. 'It's been a beautiful week for me,' Bautista said. 'I have the feeling that I could have played today's match a little bit better,' added the 26-year-old, who was facing Nadal for the first time. 'I'm happy with what I've been doing recently so I hope that the rest will keep on going in the same way.'","Nadal won 6-4 6-3 as he bids to win his second successive Madrid Open .

"Owen Paterson said the Conservative party must 'rediscover the virtues of low taxation' The Tories must ‘rediscover the virtues of low taxation’ and offer bigger and faster tax breaks for millions of middle-class taxpayers, a former Cabinet minister says today. Owen Paterson, sacked by David Cameron in this summer’s Government reshuffle, said the threshold for the 40p higher income tax rate would now stand at more than £75,000 if it had risen in line with wages. He praised the Prime Minister’s commitment last month to increase the threshold, currently £41,865, to £50,000 by 2020 if the Conservatives win next year’s general election, and George Osborne’s big cuts in corporation tax. But in an interview with the Daily Mail, he said the party should go ‘further and faster’ on the 40p rate, and also promise reductions in stamp duty, inheritance tax and capital gains tax. In a shot across the Chancellor’s bows, Mr Paterson warned that it was ‘irresponsible and immoral’ for Britain to keep borrowing at current rates – saying that despite the ‘best efforts’ of the Coalition, public spending was still far too high. ‘The brutal fact is that over the last 40 years, no British government has ever managed to raise more than 39 per cent of national income in tax in a single year,’ he said. ‘Everything above that has to be borrowed. We inherited a big mess – in Gordon Brown’s final year, borrowing stood at £300,000 a minute. 'But we’re still borrowing £200,000 a minute because the coalition government will be spending over £100billion more than it raised in this final year in office. ‘It’s both irresponsible and immoral to keep borrowing at the current rate and to expect our children to pay the interest. We need to cut spending further and reduce borrowing. 'The job is not even half done. ‘We’re going in the right direction. But clearly, on tax if we want to really reward people and grow the economy we should also want to go further.’ Mr Paterson continued: ‘It’s high time we Conservatives rediscovered the virtues of low taxation. Low taxes encourage effort, initiative and enterprise. 'People in the middle need more incentives because they are the ones who produce the wealth. Mr Paterson said the Government should consider low taxation more seriously, adding the current rate at which Britain is borrowing is both 'irresponsible and immoral' ‘The 40p tax rate only applied to one in 20 in the late 1980s – now it’s nearly one in six. Had it been indexed in line with wage growth, it would cut in at over £75,000 a year.’ As well as faster action on the 40p tax rate, the former Environment Secretary, whose rancorous dismissal in July angered the Tory Right, also called for cuts to inheritance tax, stamp duty and capital gains tax to feature in the Conservative election manifesto. Stamp duty used to be levied at 1 per cent and only on the most expensive properties. But by 2018, four-fifths of homes will be hit by it. Mr Paterson said it had been a ‘nonsense’ for the Coalition to increase capital gains tax to 28 per cent – a decision which had caused a ‘sharp reduction in the amount of income coming in’. He suggested Mr Cameron should revive his commitment at the last election – scuppered by the Liberal Democrats – to exempt everyone but millionaires from inheritance tax. ‘It’s double taxation – people have already paid tax once on their earnings,’ the MP said. Mr Paterson was speaking ahead of today’s launch of his new centre-Right think-tank, UK2020, which he said would promote ‘common-sense, small ‘c’ conservative’ solutions to Britain’s problems. He set out further proposals for cutting spending – saying there were ‘too many chairs’ at the Cabinet table. The number of government departments had only been maintained by Mr Cameron to give Lib Dem ministers jobs, Mr Paterson claimed. ‘We shouldn’t shy away from getting rid of departments,’ he said. ‘Can we really afford the Business Department, the Energy and Climate Change Department, Culture, Media and Sport or International Development as independent departments with all the associated costs?’ Mr Paterson praised Iain Duncan Smith’s work to reform the welfare system. But he insisted more work was needed given that welfare spending is still ‘soaking up £120billion a year’. If pay and pensions in the public sector were brought down to the average in the private sector it would save £50billion a year. Fraud in the public sector, estimated to cost as much as £20 billion a year, should also be reined in.","Owen Paterson said the Government should promise more tax reductions .

The front toy had a satisfied smirk and a cheeky wink while its grey-and-white compatriot approached it from behind. Kim Jong-Un appears oblivious that two cuddly toys have been placed behind him in a compromising position . Kim Jong-Un was seen without a cane according to North Korean for the first time since undergoing surgery . In the orphanage photograph, Kim is pictured holding what appears to be a cigarette as he rests against a pink bed. When he returned in October, he was walking with a pronounced limp despite the use of a cane. North Korean media released the images of Kim in a bid to show that he had recovered from his recent health scares. One of the new images showed Kim walking past a chair while inspecting soldiers. In a second photograph, Kim was photographed standing while clapping his hands. Earlier Kim appeared at a number of events using a black cane for support, including when he inspected the cockpit of a North Korean fighter jet. Kim Jong-Un's father Kim Jong-Il died in 2011. Since then, the dictator has regularly appeared at public events in North Korea, being photographed. Hundreds of troops clapped as Kim walked several yards in front of them without any walking aid . After returning to public view last month, Kim Jong-Un was photographed using a large black cane . The images appeared in the official newspaper of the North Korean Communist Party . Since his return to public view, it is understood that Kim has ordered the execution of several leading members of the communist party. One top military official was dragged from his home and shot by firing squad after he changed several of the words of a socialist anthem during a karaoke session. Instead of singing 'hate your enemies, love your country', the official chanted 'hate your wife, love your mistress.' Several other officials were believed to have been executed after they were reported for watching South Korean soap operas.","Kim Jong-Un was photographed during a visit to a Pyongyang orphanage .

"The baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple broke down today as she told an audience she has been forced to close her business. Melissa Klein and her husband Aaron were driven out of their small-scale bakery Sweet Cakes in Gresham, Oregon, after they said it would 'violate their religious beliefs' to do business with lesbian couple Rachel Cryer and Laurel Bowman. The couple is now fighting a $150,000 law suit after the state found there to be strong evidence that they broke the law by refusing the serve the women. Scroll down for video . Hit back: Melissa Klein (pictured with her husband Aaron) tearfully hit out at the state and protesters as the couple faces a $150,000 law suit for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple last summer . Today, the disgraced cook told the Values Voter Summit she was left distraught by the ordeal and described her passion for the job she has been forced to quit, Talking Points Memo reported. Klein is still taking small orders from home, but insists her career has been destroyed by the conflict. She said: 'For me personally when I would sit down with them I just would want to know everything her wedding. 'I'd want to know about the flowers, her dress, the centerpieces, her colors, the way her hair is going to be. I would even want to talk about ""where are you going on your honeymoon?""'

"Ed Miliband risks a row with his party by imposing the whip on a controversial vote today asking MPs to recognise the state of Palestine. Labour MPs have been ordered to observe a one-line whip - meaning those who turn up have to back the motion which comes before the Commons today. But it is understood that several members of the shadow cabinet had asked for it to be free vote so they could abstain, and high-profile members of Mr Miliband’s frontbench have refused to attend. Ed Miliband has imposed the whip on a controversial vote to recognise the state of Palestine . Labour figures who oppose it claim it is ‘mad’ to simply recognise a state in principle, rather than support the Israeli and Palestinians side to engage in meaningful negotiations to make it happen. The motion, forced by Labour backbencher Grahame Morris will almost certainly get through as many Tories and Liberal Democrats – who have been given a free vote – will also back it. One senior Labour MP, who is against the vote, said: ‘It’s completely mad. Immediate recognition of a Palestinian state will only encourage hardliners on both sides, when we should be encouraging on both sides who are willing to negotiate a peace deal to do so. ‘Long, hard, detailed negotiations are the only way to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This will cause huge anger and bitterness seven months before the election when we should be pulling together.’ The Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent, sovereign state in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem as its capital, and the Gaza Strip - where intense fighting took place in July . A Palestinian woman carries her daughter past rubble from a home which police said was destroyed in an Israeli air strike in Beit Hanu, in the northern of Gaza Strip in July . Alan Duncan, the former Conservative minister said the UK had a ‘historic and moral duty’ to recognise a Palestinian state, which was last year backed by 134 countries at the United Nations. Mr Duncan said: ‘There is no reason not to. We recognised Israel in 1948 after a rather nasty civil war there, and now for too long Palestine has been occupied, they are living a miserable life.’ But several members of the shadow cabinet are unlikely to attend including Rachel Reeves, Michael Dugher and Jim Murphy, who are all members of Labour Friends of Israel (LFI). Other high-profile absentees are likely to include Ed Miliband’s former PPS Anne McGuire, who chair LFI, Michael McCann, who is PPS to Miss Reeves; Luciana Berger, a party spokesperson on public health; Ian Austin, who was a parliamentary aide to Gordon Brown when he was prime minister; and John Woodcock, the MP for Barrow and Furness. Many MPs are concerned that the vote will cause friction within the party just seven months ahead of the election. ‘To say that this is an unfortunate situation is an understatement’ one shadow minister told the Independent on Sunday. ‘The party didn’t need to get itself into this situation. ‘There are four statues of prime ministers in the Commons Lobby - Clement Attlee, Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and David Lloyd George. They never solved the Middle East problem, yet we’ve gone and got ourselves in a tizzy over it and think we’ve got a solution.’ The motion currently states: ‘This House believes that the Government should recognise the state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel.’ Some Labour MPs indicated they would be willing to vote for the motion if it includes an amendment proposed by a senior cross-party group of MPs, including the former foreign secretary Jack Straw which would add the words ‘as a contribution to securing a negotiated two-state solution’. John Bercow will decide whether to include the amendment until tomorrow morning.’ This summer saw the worst violence in years as Israeli troops were sent into Gaza in response to heavy rocket fire and militants infiltrating civilian areas through underground tunnels. A cease fire was declared after 2,100 Gazans including hundreds of children, and 73 Israelis had been killed. Baroness Warsi, the former foreign office minister who resigned this summer calling David Cameron’s policy on the Gaza conflict ‘morally indefensible’ urged MPs to back the motion, claiming it would ‘breathe new life into the negotiations’. A Labour source said: ‘We would ask MPs to vote for party policy, but they are not compelled to attend.’","Miliband has imposed whip on a vote to recognise the state of Palestine .

"Caroline Foxley, pictured outside Gloucester Crown Court today, denied the money in the Swiss bank account was hers . A mother of two accused of claiming more than £20,000 in benefits when she had £300,000 deposited in a Swiss bank account has told a jury today that the overseas money was for her children, not herself. Caroline Foxley, 59, said the £306,000 she put into the Swiss bank was the proceeds of sale of a Cotswold house that her German ex-partner Dr Kurt Mayer had paid for. Although the account was in her name she regarded the money as 'in trust' for Dr Mayer and their children Freddie and Miranda and not hers to use, she told Gloucester Crown Court. The prosecution has alleged that she was a 'greedy and dishonest' woman who milked the State just for 'pocket money' to top up a luxury lifestyle which included putting her children through fee-paying schools including Cheltenham Ladies College. Prosecutor Stephen Mooney claimed at the start of the trial that Ms Foxley made a 'calm, calculated and rational' decision to abuse the benefits system. She claimed income support, Jobseekers allowance and council tax and housing benefit despite having the £306,000 in the Swiss bank Habibsons after the sale of the house at  Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. But Ms Foxley said she did not use the money except for paying the children's school fees or any other expense on their behalf which Dr Mayer authorised. She herself was without a home after the house sale and was heavily in debt, ultimately being declared bankrupt in 2012, she told the jury. Giving evidence on the second day of her trial she said she always considered the Habibson's account to be Dr Mayer's because the money resulted from the sale of the house he had bought. He had been an Italian based businessman who was often away from home but she regarded him as the 'love of my life,' even after their relationship ended, she said. She told the jury he died in May last year from bowel and colon cancer but she still regarded the Swiss bank money as for the benefit of her children - 24 year old Freddie, who now lives in Moscow, and Miranda, now a geography student at Newcastle University. When she first applied for benefits in 2006 - 2007 it was because Dr Mayer had stopped financially supporting her and the children, she said. He later became embroiled in a court case in Berlin where he was accused of fraud, she added. At that time, because she was worried they might lose the house, she went to Berlin and got Dr Mayer to agree to transfer the house into her name. But she insisted that after the sale of the property she had always received authorisation to pay money out of the account. Defence lawyer David Leathley asked why if she was in such difficult financial circumstances she did not pull the children out of private education to save money. But she said she wanted them to continue with their education uninterrupted. She told how after the relationship with Dr Mayer ended she began a relationship with a GCHQ spybase worker, Paul Watson, who moved into the house with her. They took out a joint mortgage on the property to pay for repairs and an extension but when Dr Mayer found out about Mr Watson he was 'beside himself with anger,' she said. 'He called me a whore and sentiments along those lines,' she said. 'He said the house was for the children, how could I have done such a thing, how could I have another relationship. He had every right to be angry and I was devastated.' Her relationship with Mr Watson ended a few weeks later and the house was sold and the £200,000 mortgage paid off - leaving her with the £306,000 equity, she said. She paid the money into an Indian bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to Cheltenham Ladies' College (pictured), the court heard . The cheque for that was given to her in 2007 and she put it into the Habibson's Bank, later transferring 200,000 euros to the Zurich branch. 'Whose money was that?' asked Mr Leathley. 'Kurt Mayer's, it was not mine,' she replied. She said that Dr Mayer later came back into her life and he ran up debts of £140,000 on her Lloyds TSB bank account after she made him a joint signatory to it. That was one of the debts she was left with when he died, she said. She told the jury that she also had a £60,000 school fees debt, she owed a friend £30,000, another friend £10,000 and had rent arrears of £9,000. She was registered bankrupt in 2012. Mr Leathley asked why she had not solved all the financial problems by using the Swiss account money. She said: 'Because it was never my money.' However, the prosecution say that as the money was in her name it disqualified her from receiving benefits because no-one with assets of more than £16,000 is entitled to claim. Ms Foxley, formerly of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, but now living in Teignmouth, Devon, denies four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances affecting her entitlement to benefits and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between March 2007 and March 2009. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Caroline Foxley accused of falsely obtaining £20,000 of state benefits .

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its protocols to better protect healthcare workers treating Ebola patients, the institute announced Monday. Three updated guidelines have been established as the United States looks to be gaining an upper hand on the virus that has infected three and led to hundreds being put under observation. The CDC now stipulates that medical personnel coming in contact or treating Ebola patients must cover all skin and hair. Scroll down for video . Cover: Medical staff were previously required to only don a face shield, leaving some skin exposed, as shown by a nurse transporting a Texas deputy who had visited the apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan. New guidelines require all skin to be covered. The previous set of guidelines—based on those from the World Health Organization—only required a mask and goggles. Use face shield, gown or coverall, boot cover and double gloves . Wear hood to completely cover the head and neck . Use respirator, not goggles . Put on waterproof apron if patient is vomiting or has diarrhea . Designate area for putting on and taking off gear . Have trained monitor supervise the putting on and removal of gear . Use disinfectant wipes on contaminated gear before removing . Disinfect gloved hands between steps while taking off gear . Conduct repeated training for using protective gear . The new guidelines also require healthcare workers to have  hands-on training putting on and taking off protective equipment and to be supervised while suiting up before treating a patient. Personal protective equipment, or PPE, for treating patients of the virus now includes a gown or coverall, disposable hoods, a respirator with face shield, boot covers and double gloves. The CDC is strengthening its protocols in the wake of two nurses contracting the virus, which is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids and tissue, after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the virus on October 8. 'Even a single healthcare worker infection is unacceptable,' Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a teleconference on the new guidelines. 43 people were declared risk free on Monday after being monitored for having come in direct or indirect contact with Duncan, who was diagnosed with Ebola after flying from Liberia. Some of those declared free of the virus were four people living with him in an apartment, including Louise Troh, Duncan's fiancee. As of October 17, WHO reports the hemorrhagic fever has infected around 9,000 and killed more than 4,500 people in  Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa. Protection: Updated guidelines also require nurses, doctors and medical technicians to receive repeat hands-on training and be supervised when putting on and taking off equipment . Lapses: The National Nurses Union have said nurses at Texas Presbyterian Hospital reported that protective suits left their necks exposed below the face mask . Exposed: Gloves were not taped to protective suits, as protocol required, exposing wrists and hands to exposure from bodily fluids . The CDC has drawn criticism for its handling of Ebola cases diagnosed in the United States. Amber Vinson reportedly spoke to a CDC official who cleared her to fly on a commercial flight with a fever of 99.5 degrees after having treated Duncan.","Old guidelines required goggles and a mask covering the face, but allowed some skin and hair to show .

"Underwater archaeologists looking for buried treasures from an ancient shipwreck in Greece have completed their first 'spacewalk under the sea'. The high-tech 'Exosuit' is being used to explore the Antikythera shipwreck, and has allowed them to dive to more than double the depths of previous expeditions. It was on this location that the so-called Antikythera Mechanism - a 2nd-century BC device dubbed the world's oldest computer - was discovered by sponge divers in 1900 off the remote Greek island. Scroll down for video . Greek technical diver Alexandros Sotiriou discovers an intact 'lagynos' ceramic table jug and a bronze rigging ring on the Antikythera Shipwreck. These objects are among the first finds since divers returned to the 2,200-year-old wreck off the coast of Greece . The Exosuit, built in Canada by Nuytco Research, lets divers reach depths of 492ft (150 metres). It is made of aluminium, with 18 joints in the arms and legs. The suit is able to supply oxygen for up to 50 hours, and maintains communication with the surface via an optical cable. It also has four 1.6 horsepower thrusters on the back to help the diver move around underwater at relatively high speeds. Each suit weighs between 35 (226kg) and 42 stone (272kg). Prices start at around £360,000 ($588,000). The highly complex mechanism, consisting of up to 40 bronze cogs and gears, was used by the ancient Greeks to track the cycles of the solar system. It was so advanced, it took another 1,500 years for an astrological clock of similar sophistication to be made in Europe. Today, the team completed their first dive. The rescued antiquities include tableware, ship components, and a giant bronze spear that would have belonged to a life-sized warrior statue. Components of the ship, including multiple lead anchors over a metre long and a bronze rigging ring with fragments of wood still attached, prove that much of the ship survives, the team say. The finds are also scattered over a much larger area than the sponge divers realized, covering 300 meters of the seafloor. This together with the huge size of the anchors and recovered hull planks proves that the Antikythera ship was much larger than previously thought, perhaps up to 50 meters long. 'The evidence shows this is the largest ancient shipwreck ever discovered,' says Foley. 'It's the Titanic of the ancient world.' The archaeologists also recovered a beautiful intact table jug, part of an ornate bed leg, and most impressive of all, a 2-meter-long bronze spear buried just beneath the surface of the sand. Too large and heavy to have been used as a weapon, it must have belonged to a giant statue, perhaps a warrior or the goddess Athena, says Foley. In 1901, four giant marble horses were discovered on the wreck by the sponge divers, so these could have formed part of a complex of statues involving a warrior in a chariot that was pulled by the four horses. WHOI Diving Safety Officer Edward O'Brien 'spacewalks' in the Exosuit, suspended from the Hellenic Navy vessel . Underwater archaeologists looking for buried treasures from an ancient shipwreck in Greece have begun testing their high-tech 'Exosuit' (pictured being lowered into the sea) The equipment is being used to explore the Antikythera shipwreck and has allowed them to dive to more than double the depths of previous expeditions (pictured) Over the weekend, the team hoping to find the ancient computer posted a video to YouTube that shows the Exosuit being tested in Vatika Bay, near the Greek island of Antikythera. On Tuesday, the team wrote on their blog that Ed O'Brien from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution became the first person to dive using the Exosuit in the deep water off Antikythera. In another blog post on the 29th September, they noted: 'The weather has really blown up in Antikythera, giving us a taste of how harsh conditions can be. No wonder there are many shipwrecks in the region. The Exosuit, built in Canada by Nuytco Research, lets divers reach depths of 492ft (150 metres), while still performing delicate tasks, said archaeologist Theotokis Theodoulou. Up until now, divers had only been able to operate at a depth of 196ft (60 metres). The suit, which makes the wearer resemble Buzz Lightyear, 'expands our capabilities', continued Mr Theodoulou, and 'I'll be able to grasp, pluck, clench and dig... for several hours,' he added. Archaeologists believe many other artefacts are yet to be discovered in and around the wreck. The mechanism was found with a bronze statue of a youth in the wreck of a cargo ship apparently carrying treasures to Rome, and researchers are certain that other items on board still remain to be discovered. 'We have good signs that there are other objects present,' said Angeliki Simosi, head of Greece's directorate of underwater antiquities, after exploratory dives in the area in 2012 and 2013. 'There are dozens of items left, this was a ship bearing immense riches from Asia Minor,' added Dimitris Kourkoumelis, another archaeologist on the team. Archaeologists, including Brendan Foley (pictured) have returned to the shipwreck of Antikythera using the Exosuit, which lets them dive to more than double the depths of previous expeditions. It was the site of the  Antikythera Mechanism, a 2nd-century BC device dubbed the world's oldest computer, found in 1900 . Return to Antikythera project chief diver Philip Short inspects the bronze spear recovered from the Antikythera Shipwreck . The archaeologists also hope to confirm the presence of a second ship, some 820ft (250 metres) away from the original discovery site. Antikythera, which now has a population of only 44, was once one of antiquity's busiest trade routes, and a base for Cilician pirates, some of whom once captured and held the young Julius Caesar for ransom. He later had them all captured and crucified. The Greek team is assisted by Brendan Foley, a marine archaeologist from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which was involved in a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. The Mechanism (pictured) was recovered from a Roman cargo shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera. Previous studies have shown it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years. Scans in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses . Foley has helped in outings to identify ancient shipwrecks over the last five years. We may find one or more monumental statues that were left behind in 1901, in the mistaken belief that they were rocks,' Foley said. As well as the new Exosuit, the Antikythera expedition will also use robot mapping equipment and new advanced closed-circuit 'rebreathers', which will allow divers much more time underwater. 'We will have more bottom time than any previous human visitors to the site, because we dive with mixed gas rebreathers,' the expedition's website said. 'Each diver will have more than 30 minutes of bottom time per day, and will enjoy greater mental acuity and a larger safety margin than that of previous divers at Antikythera.' Antikythera (highlighted) which now has a population of only 44, was once one of antiquity's busiest trade routes, and a base for Cilician pirates, some of whom once captured and held the young Julius Caesar for ransom. He later had them all captured and crucified . The Mechanism was recovered in 1900 from the Antikythera wreck - a Roman cargo shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera. It was discovered in a wooden box measuring 13 inchesx7 inchesx3.5 inches (340×180×90mm) and consists of bronze dials, gears and cogs. A further 81 fragments have since been found containing a total of 40 hand-cut bronze gears. The mechanism is said to have been created in around 100BC, and is believed to be the world's oldest calculator. Previous studies have shown that it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years. More than 80 fragments of the Mechanism have been found, containing a total of 40 hand-cut bronze gears (pictured) Scans of the mechanism in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses, and record important events in the Greek calendar, such as the Olympic Games. Astronomer Professor Mike Edmunds of Cardiff University said at the time: 'It is more complex than any other known device for the next 1,000 years.' The scans also revealed the mechanism was originally housed in a rectangular wooden frame with two doors, covered in instructions for its use. At the front was a single dial showing the Greek zodiac and an Egyptian calendar. On the back were two further dials displaying information about lunar cycles and eclipses. The calculator would have been driven by a hand crank. The mechanism recorded several important astronomical cycles known to the Babylonians hundreds of years before that help predict eclipses. These include the Saros cycle - a period of around 18 years separating the return of the moon, Earth and sun to the same relative positions. The device could track the movements of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - the only planets known at the time, the position of the sun, and the location and phases of the moon. The researchers have been able to read all the month names on a 19-year calendar on the back of the mechanism. The month names are Corinthian - suggest that it may have been built in the Corinthian colonies in north-western Greece or Syracuse in Sicily. The device was created at a time when the Romans had gained control of much of Greece. The Mechanism is on display at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens.

"A man who survived cancer three times has revealed how he beat the deadly disease by overhauling his diet and swapping beers and partying for vegetable juices and meditation. Scott Stephens, 37, from Warneet, an hour out of Melbourne, was like any other normal guy  when he encountered his 'worst nightmare' at just 23. After finding a suspicious looking mole on his thigh Mr Stephens went to a skin specialist to have it looked at. Scott Stephens was just 23 when he was diagnosed with melanoma on his thigh . Mr Stephens was given the all clear after the first diagnosis but was but six months later he was told the melanoma had returned to the lymph nodes in his groin . He says even the doctor didn't suspect anything serious when he removed the mole and sent the samples off as a precaution. 'The skin specialist called me to give me the news. He said it was Metastatic Melanoma and I just couldn't believe it', the father of two told Daily Mail Australia. 'At such a young age I didn't believe I could have cancer. 'I had some scans and the doctors removed the tissue around the mole and I was given the all clear, I thought that was a close call.' Just six months later Mr Stephens went for a check up and was given the devastating news that the melanoma had returned to the lymph nodes in his groin. Mr Stephens had 12 months of chemotherapy and went into remission, he got married and starting trying to live a 'normal life' before the cancer returned again for a third time . He was put on a 12-month course of immunotherapy treatment which took him into remission and he started to live his life again. He said: 'At the end the doctors said 'you are all good' and they said I was in remission. 'It was a tough time because you still live in fear and at the early stages you are pretty fragile individual, any aches I had I thought its back, it must be the cancer. 'I never sunbathed as a kid and my parents always put sun cream on me. 'I never considered myself to be a lobster, I was 23 when all this started, back then I thought I was an adult, now when I look back, I was like a baby.' After nine months of being in remission Mr Stephens proposed to his girlfriend and she said yes and he says he tried to return to a 'normal life'. They got married on a beach and started building a house for their new life together. But just after returning from their honeymoon his regular check ups revealed a large mass in his chest. The melanoma returned to his chest, pelvis and bowels and he says he hit 'rock bottom' and it was then he decided to get healthier and change his diet . He said: 'The doctors considered me to be a risk so I was on six monthly check ups. A biopsy on the tumour confirmed the melanoma was back. 'I had major surgery to remove the tumour and I came out clean. It was then at my next three monthly check up that the doctors told me the tumour was back and it had spread to my pelvis and the bowel. 'After the massive surgery I was not prepared for that and I just cried. 'I asked the doctor what can we do and he said I could have chemotherapy but it only had a five per cent success rate. 'I thought I am only 27, I hit rock bottom, I thought I am going to die. I hit the the wall and thought my number was up, this could be it. 'After I had the chest surgery and in between the diagnosis, I was bed ridden and a friend told me about The Gawler Foundation that provide support and information for people with cancer. 'I thought I am going to do this and I attended one of their groups.' Mr Stephens went on a retreat and he says they talked about all the things you can do to help yourself like meditation, nutrition, vegetable juicing and make yourself the healthiest person you can be. He said: 'I decided then to change my life, it was a massive cultural shift for me. I was a beer drinking carnivore and I had a terrible diet. The father of two got a juicer and began meditating everyday and practising Qi Gong to help him overcome the cancer . 'This new thing I was thinking about was a massive shift, I wanted to live, so I took all the meat and beer out of my fridge, I started to do light exercise, I used to walk around the block, that was all I could handle. 'I adopted a proper plant based diet and just thought I am just going to look after myself to the best of my ability and I thought I am just going to give this my best shot and hopefully I will live. 'I started a new round of chemotherapy about the same time and I lost 10kg in a week. 'I didn't think I could take much more, I thought chemotherapy was going to finish me off so I decided to not keep going with it. 'I made my peace with the world, it was up and down, but at the next appointment three months later I went back to my doctor and he said I was stable and that was the best news we could hope for.' Mr Stephens was practising Qi Gong, meditating three times a day for 45 minutes, juicing four times a day and walking half an hour each day. Months later doctors found the tumour had disappeared and Mr Stephens has now been cancer free for eight years . He said: 'I was really looking after myself and three months after having surgery for a blocked bowel I had another check up. 'My doctor was going through my notes reading the report and when he got to the end there was no mention of the tumour. 'We thought he had the wrong notes but he pulled up the scan and it showed the tumour on the pelvis had gone.' Mr Stephens has now been cancer free for eight years and is a proud father to seven-year-old Lily and five-year-old Flynn. Mr Stephens has continued to meditate daily and doesn't eat meat since beating cancer . Mr Stephens says the 'changes saved my life' and he 'would not be alive today' without them . 'That just gave me more motivation to live a healthy life. I know these changes saved my life and without the tools I have had along the way I know that I would not be alive today.' Mr Stephens will be taking part in the Cancer Council Victoria Seven Parks Walk on Sunday, October 5. He is an ambassador for the Cancer Council and wants to raise awareness of the disease. It is a 27km loop around the inner city of Melbourne, highlighting the magnificent parks of the city. Parks along the route include Albert Park, Docklands Park, Flagstaff Gardens, Royal Park, Princes Park, Treasury Gardens and Melbourne & Olympic Parks. At each of the seven parks will be an event village, with select villages providing food, refreshments and entertainment.

"When Jordan Axani booked an around-the-world plane ticket for him and his girlfriend in March he began gearing up for the romantic getaway of a lifetime. But his relationship with Elizabeth Gallagher came to a end, leaving the 27-year-old with a pricey travel itinerary and no one to share it with. Knowing that it is almost impossible to change the name on an airplane ticket, the Canadian felt he only had one choice - find someone with the same name as his ex. Proposed trip: Jordan Axani booked the around the world ticket with his girlfriend Elizabeth Gallagher in March, but the pair have since broken up . Change of plan: Knowing that it is almost impossible to change the name on an airplane ticket, the Canadian felt he only had one choice - find someone with the same name as his ex . Therefore he started an online campaign to find someone with a Canadian passport, called Elizabeth Gallagher. Taking off on December 21 from New York's JFK International Airport, the 18-day whirlwind trip takes in Italy, France, Thailand and India, before heading back to Toronto. To begin his search, he posted a plea on Reddit. It said: 'I need your help. You see, in March I booked a fairly wicked trip around the world for this Christmas for my ex and I. 'While our relationship has come to a close, I am still planning on going on the trip and she is not (naturally). 'And because I hate the idea of a ticket around the world going to waste, I am looking for a Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher who could use the ticket. Expectations: Mr Axani has laid down a few ground rules for his trip, suggesting he is not looking for companionship or romance and wants his fellow traveler to simply enjoy the trip . Plea: Considering his options, Mr Axani began his search by posting this message on Reddit . 'Anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible. 'Moreover, the flights were purchased during a massive blow-up on Priceline and were frankly so cheap and on so many different airlines that they're not worth the headache or money to cancel.' The journey begins on December 21 in New York city with a flight to Milan. From there, Mr Axani heads to Prague, Paris, Bangkok and New Delhi, before heading back to Toronto on January 8. Before potential candidates start applying to accompany him, he has laid some ground rules, but has offered to buy the first glass of wine before jetting off. Traveler: Mr Axani, laying the ground rules for his potential companion, said: 'Embracing the spontaneity of life is more my thing, though, so if you want to travel together (and are not an axe murder) I’m likely game . He wrote: 'I am not looking for anything in return. I am not looking for companionship, romance, drugs, a trade, or to take selfies with you in front the Christmas Market in Prague. 'If you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks, great. Really the only thing I ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness. 'We can travel together and see some cool stuff - or not. I'm easy and have no problem with someone taking the tickets and doing their own thing (see ya on the plane!).

"Joe Lentini went to dinner at Bobby Flay Steak not knowing much about wine. He left having learned a harsh lesson. Lentini and his companions were taking a business dinner at the Atlantic City restaurant in the Borgata Hotel, and while ordering the wine he asked the server for a recommendation. 'I asked the waitress if she could recommend something decent because I don't have experience with wine,' Lentini told NJ.com. Scroll down for video . Sticker shock: When the diners received the bill, with a wine they thought was only $37.50, they were shocked to find it was more than $4,000 thanks to the bottle of Screaming Eagle . 'She pointed to a bottle on the menu,' a 2011 Screaming Eagle. 'I didn't have my glasses. I asked how much and she said, ""Thirty-seven fifty.""' In the words of Lentini, he thought he meant $37.50, the table approved and the wine was ordered. When the bill came, the host who had agreed to cover the dinner was shocked to find it totaled over $4,000. At the top of the list of items ordered was the Screaming Eagle, but with the staggeringly high price tag of $3,750. In the words of another dining companion Don Chin, when the bill came, 'We all had a heart attack.' The party complained that the waitress had been misleading when she informed Lentini and the other guests about the price of the wine. Misled: Joe Lentini claims he heard the waitress say 'thirty-seven fifty' and only assumed that the bottle only cost $37.50 . High life: The diners in the party had expected an expensive dinner of steak and seafood, but the $3,750 was a shock, especially for Lentini, who did not often drink wine . 100 point: Screaming Eagle is considered one of the best bottles of wine in the world - and is priced as such, fetching over $1000 a bottle at auction . The restaurant offered to drop the price of the wine to $2,200, which the party begrudgingly accepted. 'As the leading culinary destination in this region, we consistently serve as many, if not more high-end wine and spirits without incident,' executive vice president Joseph Lupo said. 'In this isolated case, both the server and sommelier verified the bottle requested with the patron,' said Lupo, who claimed the host did not 'say anything to management.' The unidentified host of the dinner reportedly confirmed to NJ.com that he did learn the price before the bill was handed out, but that the bottle was open and likely empty  so he kept quiet. According to the restaurant's menu, the bottle recommended was the second most expensive for its size. So how was the wine? Self-declared wine amateur Lentini says, 'It was okay. It was good. It wasn't great. It wasn't terrible. It was fine.' For those looking for the experience of enjoying shockingly expensive wine in the comfort of their own home, bottles of Screaming Eagle's 2011 vintage sell at auction beginning around $1000.","Joe Lentini asked the waitress at Bobby Flay Steak in Atlantic City for a wine recommendation for a business dinner .

"With five 'guest cottages', two staff houses and a double-storey house to choose from, there's no shortage of choice when it comes to finding a bedroom in the Cape Town mansion once owned by Earl Spencer. The property, which was sold off by the Earl in 2000, is back on the market and comes complete with a suite used by Princess Diana that has been preserved intact since her death in 1997. Tarrystone, which is in the upmarket Cape Town suburb of Constantia, also boasts two vineyards which between them produce 300 bottles of wine a year - and one of the main reasons for the eye-watering 80 million rand (£4.8 million) price tag. Lavish: The deluxe suite last used by Princess Diana in January 1997 has been preserved intact since her death . Luxury: The property includes £500,000 worth of artworks and curtains made from luxury fabric sourced in Venice . Visit: Princess Diana was a regular visitor to South Africa and met the late Nelson Mandela during one of her trips . Lavish though the property is, it is most famous for its royal connection and was last visited by the princess in January 1997, months before she was killed in a car accident in Paris. Her heartbroken brother, Earl Spencer, made his first statement to the press on the steps of the house days later. 'While the home has been beautifully renovated, the suite that Princess Diana stayed in as late as the January before her death has been preserved as it was,' said a spokesman for estate agents, Seeff. The suite, which boasts a kitchenette and an en-suite bathroom as well as a large bedroom, sits inside the main four-bedroom property, along with a 10-seater cinema room. Also included in the sale are several guest cottages, a garden that comes complete with a 'jungle gym' and koi pond, and £500,000-worth of well-preserved artworks. Tragedy: A grieving Earl Spencer made his first statement to the press following Princess Diana's death on the steps of the property . Missed: Princess Diana enjoyed many happy holidays at the property, as did her sons Princes William and Harry . Spacious: The property also includes two vineyards which produce, on average, 300 bottles of wine a year and views of Table Mountain . Beautiful: Although the Princess Diana suite is unchanged, the rest of the house has been totally renovated . Airy: The four-bedroom property also comes with seven external cottages - five for guests and two for staff . Other amenities include a manager's office, a guard house, a tennis court and a swimming pool, and the property also boasts spectacular views of Table Mountain. Despite the hefty price tag, estate agents Seeff say they have already had several enquiries about the property, which has been sold three times since being sold by Earl Spencer, who has now returned to the UK permanently, in 2000. The Earl, who married for the third time in 2011, now lives at the Spencer family seat Althorp in Northamptonshire with his Canadian wife Karen and their two-year-old daughter Lady Charlotte Diana Spencer, who was named for his late sister. Moving on: Earl Spencer, pictured here with his third wife Karen, sold the Cape Town property in 2000 and returned to the UK .

"The first Ebola drug trial in Africa has started with three healthcare workers in Mali receiving an experimental vaccine. It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) today warned the virus is now 'entrenched' in the capital cities of the three worst-hit countries, and is accelerating in almost all settings. The trial started on October 8, with the first health worker receiving the drug, followed by two colleagues yesterday. Over the course of the trial 37 more healthcare workers will be given the vaccine. The first Ebola drug trial in Africa has started with three healthcare workers in Mali receiving an experimental vaccine. Scientists say if successful it will 'alter the dynamic of the outbreak' The trial is taking place at Mali's Centre for Vaccine Development. Professor Myron Levine is pictured outside, centre, with Professor Samba Sow, director general of the CVD, right . Three Malian health workers have been given the experimental vaccine, as 37 more prepare to take part in the trial . Professor Levine pictured with staff at Mali's Centre for Vaccine Development where the trial is taking place . Pictured, health workers check on patients at a WHO health centre in the Liberian capital of Monrovia . A Liberian Ministry of Health worker speaks to a family at an Ebola holding centre in Monrovia . It is the latest vaccine to be rushed into clinical trials as the worst-ever Ebola outbreak grips West Africa. The WHO said the disease has so far claimed the lives of more than 3,800 people, infecting at least 8,000 people in West Africa. The organisation's deputy head Bruce Aylward warned that the world's response is not keeping up with the disease in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - the three worst-hit nations. Yesterday African leaders chided the international community  for its slow response to the epidemic and appealed to the world to turn promises of aid into action on the ground. In emotional appeals to a high-level meeting of major donors gathered at the World Bank, the leaders of  Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, said they needed everything from treatment centres to healthcare workers, equipment and funding. Professor Myron Levine, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who helped developed the experimental drug, said if successful the trial 'could alter the dynamic' of the current outbreak. While the university's dean Albert Reece, said the research 'will play a key role in helping solve' the crisis. Sierra Leone's President Ernest Koroma told the meeting in Washington via video conference: 'Our people are dying. Healthcare workers are at the front line of the epidemic, and are most likely to become infected with Ebola . If successful it will be months before any vaccine is available and the initial quantities will be reserved for healthcare workers fighting the crisis . The World Health Organisation (WHO) today warned the virus is now 'entrenched' in the capital cities of the three worst-hit countries, and is accelerating in almost all settings . The WHO's deputy head Bruce Aylward warned that the world's response is not keeping up with the disease in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - the three worst-hit nations . Scientists at a British company say they have come up with a test to fight the Ebola epidemic. Experts at Primerdesign Ltd said it has developed a fast and simple way to screen suspected victims. They say the kit detects the DNA fingerprint of the Ebola Virus in the blood in just 90 minutes and is 'affordable' and 'easy to use'. The firm is now in talks with the World Health Organisation about plans to roll out large numbers to the frontline in West Africa as soon as possible. Doctor Jim Wicks, Managing Director of Primerdesign, a spin-off company from the University of Southampton, said it meets an 'urgent' need. Dr Wicks said: 'Accurate diagnostics is essential in controlling an outbreak like Ebola. 'There is an urgent need for rapid testing to screen suspected patients and people travelling in and out of the region. 'Our test is quick, affordable and easy to perform.' By picking up minute quantities of the disease in the early stages, the kit makes pre-emptive healthcare intervention possible. It works on the principle that viruses all have a unique genetic fingerprint, like humans, only its encoded in RNA (Ribonucleic acid) rather than DNA. A blood sample is taken from the patient before RNA is extracted, placed in a tube with the kit's ingredients and run through a machine. The result is ready within 90 minutes. 'Without you we can't succeed, without your quick response a tragedy unforeseen'. Professor Levine, said: 'This research will give us crucial information about whether the vaccine is safe, well tolerated and capable of stimulating adequate immune responses in the highest priority target population, health care workers in West Africa.' 'If it works, in the foreseeable future it could help alter the dynamic of this epidemic by interrupting transmission to health care and other exposed front-line workers.' The drug consists of an adenovirus (cold virus) that does not cause illness in humans. It has been modified so it can't multiply in humans, but produces a single attachment protein of Ebola virus. The body's immune responses against this single Ebola protein have been found to be highly protective in studies carried out on animals, researchers said. Prior to September the vaccine had only been tested in animals. A second trial on African soil is expected to begin soon in the Gambia, to run in parallel with the Mali study. Ordinarily it would take between six to 11 months to obtain the necessary ethical, technical and administrative approvals to move from animal vaccine trials to one in a developing country, where subjects are at risk of the natural disease. But the consortium behind the vaccine study worked in unison to achieve the goal in two months. Professor Samba Sow, director general of Mali's centre for vaccine development said: 'This is just the critical first step in a series of additional clinical trials that will have to be carried out to fully evaluate the promising vaccine. The WHO said the disease has so far claimed the lives of more than 3,800 people, infecting at least 8,000 people in West Africa . Promise Cooper, 16, fills a bottle with a chlorine solution with the help of a community activist who visits Promise and her two brothers on a daily basis at their  home in Monrovia, Liberia after they were orphaned by the Ebola outbreak . Yesterday African leaders chided the international community for its slow response to the epidemic and appealed to the world to turn promises of aid into action on the ground . 'However, if it is eventually shown to work and if this information can be generated fast enough, it could become a public health tool to bring the current, and future, Ebola virus disease epidemics under control.' And Dr Milagritos Tapia, the clinical investigator overseeing the trial in Mali, added: ' 'Malian health care workers are showing keen interest in participating in the clinical trial to help evaluate this vaccine.' Praising the work of the scientists involved, Dean Albert Reece of the University of Maryland , said: 'Ebola is among the most urgent international public health issues we are facing. 'This research will play a key role in helping to solve it... (the scientists) have done an extraordinary job, and are working hard to contribute their expertise to the worldwide effort to fight this virus.' But it is likely to be months before any effective vaccine will be made available. And in the first instance, any small quantities produced, would be given to healthcare workers on the front line fighting the disease. It is hoped the move will help encourage doctors, nurses and other health workers - who are at highest risk of becoming infected - to join the fight against the disease in West Africa. The vaccine was developed at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Ebola vaccine trials are also underway in the UK, led by Oxford University and the Wellcome Trust, and in the US, at the National Institutes of Health. While Mali is yet to sucummb to the spread of the vicious disease, experts say it is vital vaccines are trialled in Africa.","Two health workers in Mali have received an experimental vaccine .

"How far would you go to help a friend in trouble? Four unsuspecting members of the public were put to the test to see how they would react when asked to cover up a violent crime for a loved one.

They were each told there had been a  incident the night before, directed to a 'bloody' shirt, and asked to hide it - with all of the four doing so with barely a second thought. Bundles of cash and incriminating evidence were quickly concealed, or shoved into a bag by the friends, who then either hid them or made to leave the apartment clutching them. But before they can make their escape, the police knock on the door, asking for the whereabouts of their loved one. Each lies to say they do not know.

The truth is revealed when they are led down the stairwell by police - and greeted by the laughing pranksters who reveal it has been little more than an elaborate experiment.

When it comes to protecting loved ones, people are most likely to break the law for their children (42 per cent), closely followed by their partner (27 per cent) and their parents (13 per cent). The research shows that men are more likely than women to protect their spouse, with 32 per cent prepared to break the law for their partner compared to 21 per cent of women.

"The eight-year jail sentence of Max Clifford, pictured after his arrest, was upheld by three Court of Appeal judges today . Disgraced PR guru Max Clifford has lost a challenge against his eight-year jail sentence for sex offences. The sentence was upheld by three Court of Appeal judges in London today. Clifford, 71, was jailed in May after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults, carried out between 1977 and 1984, using his celebrity connections to lure women. The former celebrity agent, who branded his accusers 'fantasists', denied the charges, but was convicted at London's Southwark Crown Court. Announcing the appeal court's decision, Lord Justice Treacy, who heard the case with Mr Justice Turner and Judge Michael Pert, said the sentence was 'justified'. At a recent appeal hearing, Clifford's barrister Richard Horwell QC told the three judges that Clifford's last offence was committed 29 years ago, 'since when he has led an industrious life, and devoted a considerable part of his time to charitable works for which he has raised substantial funds'. The trial judge had 'accepted that he is no longer a danger to women and that he will not commit further offences', he added. Mr Horwell said that for a number of reasons the sentence imposed was 'too long'. He added: 'Although the sentencing process must reflect modern attitudes, and I fully accept that that is our law, the sentencing process must not abandon common sense and fairness.' Rosina Cottage QC, for the Crown, said the total sentence imposed was one the trial judge was 'entitled to reach'. When sentencing Clifford, Judge Anthony Leonard told him his personality and position in the public eye were the reasons his crimes were not revealed earlier. He said: 'The reason why they were not brought to light sooner was because of your own dominant character and your position in the world of entertainment which meant that your victims thought that you were untouchable, something that I think you too believed.' Lawyers for Clifford, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court during his trial, claimed the sentence was 'excessive', but  senior judges backed the prison term . He added: 'These offences may have taken place a long time ago, when inappropriate and trivial sexual behaviour was more likely to be tolerated, but your offending was not trivial, but of a very serious nature.' Clifford is currently serving his sentence at Littlehey Category C men's prison in Cambridgeshire. Announcing the court's decision today, Lord Justice Treacy said: 'It seems to us that, after consideration of the individual offences and the application of modern sentencing attitudes reflected in the guidelines, but tempered by the need to have regard to the statutory maximum available at the time, an overall sentence of eight years was justified and correct.' It was a 'just and proportionate' sentence 'taking account of considerations of harm and culpability together with aggravating factors and such mitigation as was available to the appellant'. Lord Justice Treacy said Clifford was sentenced to a total of eight years on eight counts of indecent assault relating to four victims who were 'young and vulnerable' at the time of the offences. Clifford pictured attending the funeral of his  brother Bernie at Crematorium in Morden in August . The senior judge said: 'Each was affected in respect of confidence and relationships and was harmed by what had been done to her.' In considering the seriousness of any offence the court 'must consider the offender's culpability and any harm which the offence caused'. The judge said: 'Sexual offending will by its very nature cause harm at the time the offence is committed, but it is well recognised that for many victims significant harm persists for a considerable period afterwards. 'This is a case where it is clear that the effect of what was done to the victims was not something from which they recovered quickly. 'The appellant's actions towards these victims had long term consequences for their lives. This is clearly a highly material circumstance for this court to consider.'","Clifford, 71, was handed eight-year term for sex offences in 1970s and 1980s .

"A Virginia father trekked across a remote desert region to claim a disputed stretch of land so his seven-year-old daughter can be a real princess. Jeremiah Heaton began his unusual quest for the unclaimed piece of land sandwiched between Egypt and Sudan after making a promise to Emily that she would one day be royalty. After reaching the desert region of Bir Tawil in June, the father-of-three planted a flag his children had designed, and made the first steps towards claiming the land. Royalty: Princess Emily and her adventurer father Jeremiah Heaton show off their flag . On his return Heaton and wife made a crown for their daughter and asked friends and family to refer to her as Princess Emily. Her kingdom covers about 800 square miles of desert that has never been claimed by Sudan or Egypt. Heaton . found Bir Tawil, one of the last unclaimed pieces of land on the . planet, after searching for how he could fulfill his promise to Emily. Promise: Heaton claimed a stretch of desert to Emily could be a real princess . Several attempts to claim ownership of the region have been made online, but Heaton believes that by actually traveling to the site and planting the flag gave his claim an edge. 'It’s . beautiful there,' Heaton said. 'It’s an arid desert in Northeastern . Africa. Bedouins roam the area; the population is actually zero.' It took . Heaton 14 hours to travel by caravan through the desert before he could . plant the flag, which has a blue background and a seal and stars . representing the family. He may have completed his journey in June, but it began at the start of the year when he was chatting to his young daughter. 'Over the . winter, Emily and I were playing, and she has a fixation on princesses. She asked me, in all seriousness, if she’d be a real princess someday,' Heaton said. 'And I said she would.' As well as designing a flag for their country, Heaton's children have also decided to name it the Kingdom of North Sudan. Princess . Emily, who sleeps in a custom-made castle bed, is showing signs of being . a generous ruler, and said that she wants to ensure children in the . region have enough food. 'That’s definitely a concern in that part of the world. We discussed what we could do as a nation to help,' Heaton said. Sovereign: Heaton trekked across the desert for 14 days to stake a claim on Bir Tawil and plant his family flag . Bir Tawil is one of the last unclaimed stretches of land on Earth, and is sandwiched between Egypt and Sudan . He added that Princess Emily, and her brothers Justin and Caleb, could become a driving force in the region. 'If we can turn North Sudan into an . agricultural hub for the area ... a lot of technology has gone into . agriculture and water,' he said. 'These are the things [the kids] are . concerned with.' The next step for Heaton is to get Sudan and Egypt to recognize his Kingdom of North Sudan. 'I feel confident in the claim we’ve . made,' Heaton said. 'That’s the exact same process that has been done . for thousands of years. The exception is this nation was claimed for . love.' Shelia Carapico, professor of political science and international studies at the University of Richmond, said the family's claim will need to be recognized by the other African nations. She said it was not plausible for someone to plant a flag and say they have political control over the land without legal recognition from neighboring countries, the United Nations or other groups. In addition, she said, it is not known whether people have ownership of the land, regardless of whether the property is part of a political nation. Ready to rule: The Heaton children want to use their kingdom to help children in the African region . The Heaton family remain undeterred however, and have ordered letterheads bearing the country's seal. One of Heaton's sons also made a serving tray featuring the flag while at camp. 'They are really getting into the idea. I think the idea of a nation with a clear purpose of helping other people ... I think that’ll be well-received and we’ll get recognition from other nations to partner with,' he said. But the main intent, Heaton added, was to show his daughter he would follow through on the promise he made. 'I think there’s a lot of love in the world. I want my children to know I will do absolutely anything for them,' he said.","Jeremiah Heaton has planted flag designed by his children in unclaimed territory between Sudan and Egypt .

"The parents of a 5-month-old were shocked when police showed up to take away their infant boy after they told a doctor they wanted a second opinion. Caught on camera, the footage shows police entering the California home of Anna and Alex Nikolayev and asking Anna to hand over the baby. ‘I’m going to grab your baby,’ one of the several officers at the scene told Nikolayev, ‘And don’t resist and don’t fight me.’ Surprise: Anna and Alex Nikolayev wanted a second opinion after doctors at a Sacramento hospital made them too nervous to leave son Sammy (pictured) in their care . ‘He grabbed my arm,’ the new mother told KXTV, ‘so I couldn't take Sammy. And they took Sammy, and they just walked away."" The saga began about two weeks ago when Sammy, who suffers from a heart murmur, began showing flu-like symptoms. The Nikolayevs took him to Sutter Memorial Hospital in Sacramento, California, the hospital where Sammy had been receiving regular treatment for his heart condition. According to Anna, the couple became alarmed after a nurse came in to give the baby antibiotics. Uncomfortable: Anna Nikolayev (left, with Alex) says the hospital made mistakes and they just weren't comfortable when doctors started discussing heart surgery . ‘I asked her, “For what is that?” And she's like, “I don't know.”' How, . Anna wondered, was the woman working as a nurse but unaware of the . purpose of a medication? Anna said a doctor would later tell her Sammy . did not need antibiotics. While . still at Sutter, Sammy was admitted to the pediatric ICU for . observation. Within a few days, doctors began discussing the possibility . of heart surgery for the baby. Motivated . by fear, Anna took Sammy from the hospital without a proper discharge . and admitted him to another hospital, Kaiser Permanente. Taken: Though they got OK'd from a different hospital to take Sammy home, police let themselves in the next day and took Sammy into protective services . Harsh: Anna, left, said CPS told her Sammy was taken due to the Nikolayev's 'severe neglect' and Alex, right, said he met police at the door and they threw him to the ground before entering the home and taking Sammy . ‘I don't want to have my baby have surgery in the hospital where I don't feel safe,’ Anna explained. Police then showed up at the second hospital. ‘They told us that Sutter was telling them so much bad stuff that they thought that this baby is dying on our arms,’ Anna said. At Kaiser Permanente, the doctor indicated on the infant's records that he was clinically safe to go home with the Nikolayevs and that there was no concern for the Sammy’s safety in their care. They went home. On April 24, the police arrived at . their house. Alex said he greeted them and was pushed to the ground when . he asked if he was being arrested. They then took Sammy away. Extreme: Anna said the doctors at Sutter Memorial (pictured) in Sacramento, California had police convinced she and her husband were bad parents . Differing: While one hospital suggested surgery, another, Kaiser Permanente (pictured) OK'd Sammy to go home with his parents . According . to Anna, a child protective services worker told her Sammy was taken . away for ‘severe neglect’ but did not elaborate on the neglect. KXTV reached out to Sutter Memorial . and were told to contact child protective services. Reporters were told . by CPS that they couldn't comment on individual cases. CPS spokesperson Laura McCasland told . the ABC affiliate, 'We conduct a risk assessment of the child's safety . and rely heavily on the direction of health care providers.' The Nikolayevs were allowed an hour of visitation with Sammy on Thursday. An outraged Alex told KXTV. ‘It seems like parents have no right whatsoever.’ ‘We . did everything,’ a tearful Anna agreed. ‘We went from one hospital to . another. We just wanted to be safe, that he is in good hands.’ A court date hearing was set for April 29. Uncertain: Sammy remains in the care of authorities, with his fate to be determined April 29 .","Anna and Alex Nikolayev had a bad experience at a Sacramento, California hospital so they took son Sammy to another area doctor .

"Celebrated crime-fiction writer John Grisham has attacked America's judicial system for wrongly locking up men he believes 'accidentally' watched child pornography. The best-selling author and lawyer - who penned novels like The Rainmaker, The Firm and The Pelican Brief - has given an astonishing interview to The Telegraph defending some child sex offenders, saying they have become victims of a legal system that has 'gone crazy'. The 59-year-old then called for lighter sentences for those caught downloading images and videos of children being sexually abused. 'We have prisons now filled with guys my age. Sixty-year-old white men in prison who've never harmed anybody, would never touch a child,' Grisham told The Telegraph. 'But they got online one night and started surfing around, probably had too much to drink or whatever, and pushed the wrong buttons, went too far and got into child porn.' Scroll down for video . 'We've gone nuts locking up sex offenders': Celebrated author John Grisham, 59, has claimed that some men who viewed child porn online are 'not real pedophiles' and 'would never harm anybody', but are still called sex offenders and sent to prison . Grisham - who is preparing to release his new tome, Gray Mountain, next week - said he feels so strongly about the issue because his friend was involved in a child porn sting about 10 years ago. He said his 'old buddy from law school' became involved in an operation organized by the FBI in Canada. 'His drinking was out of control, and he went to a website,' Grisham told The Telegraph. 'It was labelled ''sixteen-year-old wannabee hookers'' or something like that. 'And it said ''16-year-old girls''. So he went there. Downloaded some stuff - it was 16-year-old girls who looked 30. 'He shouldn't have done it. It was stupid, but it wasn't 10-year-old boys. 'He didn't touch anything. 'And God, a week later there was a knock on the door: ''FBI!'' and it was sting set up by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to catch people - sex offenders - and he went to prison for three years.' 'There's so many of them now. There's so many ''sex offenders'' - that's what they're called - that they put them in the same prison. 'Like they're a bunch of perverts, or something. 'We've gone nuts with this incarceration.' Grisham was sure to say that he has 'no sympathy for real pedophiles' and believes anyone caught committing such a crime should face harsh penalties. However he believes many men have been penalized too harshly for doing too little. Questioned about the fact that viewing child porn fuels child abuse by placing a demand on creating new material, Grisham replied that sentences should still be lower for people who only download the content. The Telegraph - who will publish their full interview with Grisham this weekend - also noted a major increase in the sentences of people charged with possession of child pornography over the last 10 years. Between 2004 and 2010, sentences doubled from 54 months to 95 months. However, a report published in February by Reason magazine claimed that offenders caught viewing child pornography often received harsher sentences than offenders caught sexually abusing children. Online reaction: Many have commented that Grisham's claims don't take into account the victims of sexual abuse involved with child pornography . Outrage: Fans quickly reacted to the controversial comments made by John Grisham, who is currently promoting his latest book, legal thriller Gray Mountain, which will be released next week . It didn't long for Grisham fans to express outrage over his controversial comments. Many readers immediately went online to crticisize the author's stance. 'After being a firm favourite of mine for over 20 years, Mr Grisham, I can state with all certainty that I will never purchase another book of yours ever again,' Karen Hanna wrote online, according to stuff.co.nz. 'I am absolutely disgusted at the stance you have taken over child pornography and have lost all respect for you.' Another fan, Bernadine Denham wrote: 'So watching child porn isn't an offence? What a disgusting thing to say. You've lost me.' Grisham is a married father-of-two. He and his wife, Renee Jones, were wed in 1981. They split their time between homes in Oxford, Mississippi, and a Charlottesville, Virginia.

"'You've done alright': Sandy Nardo, who has had 140 lovers, admired Ruth Langsford's husband Eamonn Holmes on today's This Morning . An Irish mother who has kept a diary detailing her sexual history with 140 men has said she could make room in her 'little black book' for Eamonn Holmes. Sandy Nardo, 53, from Dublin, made the proposition as she was interviewed by the TV presenter and his wife, Ruth Langsford, on today's This Morning. Speaking of how she has racked up so many lovers over the years, Sandy said: 'I was kind of looking for a husband but it's hard to get the qualities you want in one guy.' She added to Ruth: 'You've done alright. I might be able to make a little space sometime if you ever get tired of him.' An awkward-looking Eamonn quickly changed the subject to the viewers' comments while an unflappable Ruth asked Sandy if she had 'commitment issues'. Sandy said she has had so many lovers because she 'likes collecting things' and keeping a diary of her conquests became a ritual. 'I like to keep lists of things, it's a habit. It might be a bit of OCD,' she admitted. She explained how she slept with 140 men around the world - often just one night stands - as she travelled with her job as a translator. She started a list where she would rank them on their looks, dress sense and 'emotional state'. She would also keep a record of their 'solvency' (i.e how well-off they are) and how long the relationship lasted. The 140 men have all been listed with a nickname such as 'Earls Court Tube Arab', 'Italian Prince', 'Blond photographer' and alarmingly, 'The Pervert'. She said: 'Some of them were permanent for a while but then I might move countries.' She added: 'They were often one night stands, never to be repeated just to put down in my ""little black book"".' Holding on to her man: Sandy said she could make room for Eamonn in her 'little black book' if Ruth ever got tired of him . Sandy did marry and had children and her ex-husband scored 10/10 on her list - even though the marriage didn't last because he was 'mentally wrong'. She's says she still on the hunt for 'The One' - although she doesn't think a man that has all the qualities she wants actually exists. 'I wasn't going to settle for one person who didn't have all the qualities,' she said. Her diary is a way for her to keep track of the many men in her life and evaluate her relationships. Ever the professionals: Eamonn and Ruth on today's This Morning took Sandy's comments in their stride . Scoring system: Sandy rates her lovers on their looks, dress sense and solvency . 'You can got back over and see what you've got,' she explained. 'If they behaved themselves they might get an extra mark.' She added that it's also helpful in allowing her to choose a suitable date for certain occasions. She said: 'The reason for the list and the score is you might be in the mood for someone who has good humour, but that person might not be solvent with a good car. 'So if you want someone to take you to a show, you would go to that person.' When viewers suggested that Sandy's list was sexist, she replied: 'I don't know, if a man did this I think he would be, but I think a girl can get away with it.'","Sandy Nardo, 53, from Dublin, has slept with 140 men .

"Luis Felipe Scolari today named the squad he hopes can deliver glory for Brazil on home soil and had a sharp response for Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho in the process. The Brazil manager included six Premier League-based players in his 23-man panel but couldn't find room for Liverpool pair Lucas and Philippe Coutinho, the duo among a host of big European names to miss out. With an astonishing 17 World Cup rookies in his panel, Scolari, a World Cup winner with his country in 2002, opted against bringing along out-of-favour tournament veterans like Kaka or Robinho back into the fold. VIDEO Scroll down for Neymar and Alves celebrate their Brazil World Cup call-ups . Goalkeepers: Julio Cesar (Toronto FC, on loan from QPR), Jefferson (Botafogo), Victor (Atletico Mineiro) Defenders: Dani Alves (Barcelona), Maicon (Roma), David Luiz (Chelsea), Thiago Silva (PSG), Dante (Bayern Munich), Marcelo (Real Madrid), Henrique (Napoli), Maxwell (PSG). Midfield: Oscar (Chelsea), Fernandinho (Man City), Willian (Chelsea), Paulinho (Spurs), Ramires (Chelsea), Luis Gustavo (Wolfsburg), Hernanes (Inter Milan). Attackers: Bernard (Shakhtar Donetsk), Neymar (Barcelona), Fred (Fluminense), Hulk (Zenit St Petersburg), Jo (Atletico Mineiro). Advantage: Brazil are favourites to win the World Cup on home soil this summer . Calm before the storm: Scolari before announcing his 23-man squad for the World Cup in Brazil . And the one-time Chelsea manager . insisted he paid little attention to Mourinho's recent comments raising . concerns over the form of star midfielder Oscar, when he claimed the . No.10 was 'our best player to December...but arrived in the crucial . moment of the season in a low'. 'No . it doesn't concern me at all,' responded Scolari. 'Oscar is one of the . best players we have in the world, regardless of any comments from any . coach. 'He may have some . physical issues. Through the physical exams we have at the start we'll . be sure to get them right. I have no worries about Paulinho, Oscar, . Marcelo whoever.' Scolari . sprung a surprise in selecting Napoli's Henrique and PSG full back . Maxwell among his reserve defenders along with the veteran Maicon, . spurning the chance to call upon the red-hot Atletico Madrid pair of . Miranda and Felipe Luis. Big occasion: The announcement took place in front of nearly 800 journalists in Rio de Janeiro . Lucas . and Coutinho, equally, were left on the shelf along with Spurs . midfielder Sandro as Inter Milan's excellent Hernanes claimed the final . midfield slot. While there . may have been some question marks about the make-up of the wider squad, . Scolari's starting eleven, and his 4-2-3-1 formation, is all but . cemented in place. The defence of Dani Alves, David Luiz, Thiago Silva . and Marcelo in front of veteran Julio Cesar is a staple. In front of . them Paulinho and Wolfsburg's teak-tough Luis Gustavo will protect the . attacking trio of Neymar, Oscar in the middle and Hulk on the right with . Scolari's favoured son, Fred, leading the line. Fit . and in form, it's a truly formidable machine, as they proved on the way . to last summer's Confederations Cup, dismantling Spain in a manner the . World and European champions hadn't known in the final. But . worries over both form and fitness persist. Allowing for rookie-season . struggles, Neymar's form since the turn of the year and the furore over . his transfer rocked Barcelona has been pretty wretched. Mourinho rebuke . or not, Oscar has also struggled to orchestrate as devastatingly as he . can as Chelsea tapered off in the second-half of the season. Chosen ones: Brazil's coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has named his 23-man squad for the tournament . Throw . in Julio Cesar's jaunt to the MLS to pick up game time, Paulinho's . drifting in and out of the Spurs starting line-up and Marcelo finding . himself on the Real Madrid bench of late and there are undoubtedly . headaches that Scolari must hope dissipate in the next four weeks. Of . greatest concern however is the lack of big tournament experience . amongst the squad. Only six - Cesar, Maicon, Alves, Silva, Ramires and . Fred - have ever taken to a World Cup field. With the pressure of . delivering for a nation of 200 million diehards and the daunting . prospect of a last 16 showdown against Spain, Netherlands or Chile, the . rookie squad might just buckle. 'The . squad we had in 2002 was a lot more experienced. Seventeen of our . players have never played in World Cup whereas that was maybe 10 back in . 2002,' said Scolari. The big one: The World Cup begins in Brazil on June 12, finishing on July 13 with the final . Weight on your shoulders: Brazil will be under huge pressure to lift the trophy on July 13 in Rio . 'But they have experience of playing strong . competitions in Europe, Champions League. We know that that can make a . difference in certain games. 'We . are going to call on some World champions and some great players who . will come in and spend time with us and help us in these challenges. I . will go all the way to hell with these players if they need it.' Scolari . will be hoping he doesn't have to go that far. The heavenly prospect of . delivering a World Cup on home soil is a whole lot more palatable.

A seven-months-pregnant mother who fell down the stairs in a catastrophic accident died a day after her baby girl was born by an emergency Caesarean section. Debbie Gallagher was rushed to hospital after her partner Mike Faultless heard a bang and found her lying unconscious at their home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands. Doctors battled to save the 36-year-old, who had suffered a devastating head injury, thought to have been caused by striking the bannister, and her baby. Daisy was delivered two months early on July 25, 2013, weighing 4lb 15oz, but tragically her mother could not be saved and died from her injuries the next day. Mr Faultless, a Land Rover engineer, was left to bring up their baby daughter and his two step-children following the accident last year. He said: ‘Daisy is such a beautiful little girl and I am so proud of her. I know Debbie would have been so proud too. ‘It was such a terrible time. There was the elation of seeing your little girl come into the world and then, just a day later, seeing the woman you love pass away.’ Mr Faultless, 40, said he went into shock when he saw his Ms Gallagher, who had worked as a stock controller at the Leisure Box in Birmingham, lying at the bottom of the stairs. He said: ‘We had gone to bed saying how happy we were. Then there was a loud bang from downstairs that woke me up. ‘I shouted down for Debbie but I got no answer. I got up to find her and saw a figure lying at the bottom of the stairs. ‘I raced down to her and found blood coming from behind her ear. I was in total panic and shock.’ Mr Faultless has received support from Ms Gallagher’s friends in caring for Daisy as well as her other children, nine-year-old Bradley and Hanna, 17, who she previously adopted. He added: ‘Debbie was a fun-loving woman who was happiest when having a party and dancing with family and friends. Debbie Gallagher (left) and partner Mike Faultless (right) holding daughter Daisy, and nine-year-old Bradley . ‘She was a wonderful partner and mother and we planned to spend the rest of our lives together.’ Since her death, friends and family have raised almost £4,000 in her memory, which will be donated to the Intensive Care Unit at University Hospital in Coventry where she was treated. Her father James Gallagher, his partner Lynn and her sister-in-law Rachael Faultless-Hodgson have been organising a number of events to raise money for the unit, including a sponsored walk and a 60s night. The money donated to the hospital will be used to fund new equipment and facilities to enhance the care of ICU patients. Mike Faultless holds baby daughter Daisy.

"With Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge banging in goals left, right and centre, Liverpool were widely acknowledged as this season's great entertainers and the television companies seem to agree. Brendan Rodgers' side were shown by either Sky or BT Sport 29 times this season - meaning just nine of their Barclays Premier League matches were not on TV. Champions Manchester City were just three matches behind on 26, while Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham both notched up 25 games. Stoke found themselves bottom of the . table with just seven appearances, with their only match on BT Sport . coming on the opening day of the season against Liverpool. Sky also . showed their home fixture with the Anfield giants, a 5-3 thriller. Newcomers .

Chelsea or Manchester United. Meanwhile, . 91 of Sky Sports' 116 live matches featured one of those five, coming in at a slightly lower 78.4 per cent. Capitulation: Monday Night Football on Sky showed Liverpool's dramatic 3-3 draw against Crystal Palace . Mistaken identity: BT Sport showed the controversial match between Chelsea and Arsenal which saw Kieran Gibbs receive a red card for a handball by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Game changer: BT had the rights to seven of the Premier League champions, Manchester City's, matches . Perhaps surprisingly, Aston Villa were shown on television 17 times - one more than Everton - although 11 of those matches came against Arsenal, Chelsea, City, Liverpool, Tottenham or United. The table will lend ammunition to those who think the big clubs monopolise TV coverage, with the likes of Crystal Palace and Southampton playing more exciting and flowing football than United this season. Indeed, the Saints will possibly be most disappointed with their lack of exposure, especially as they have three players in England's World Cup squad. Unpopular: Stoke found themselves live on the television just seven times and only once on BT Sport . Surprising: Aston Villa were remarkably high up on the list coming in seventh having played in 17 live matches . Blessing or a curse?

"These eerie images give a chilling glimpse into a once-bustling city market dating back eight decades that now lies like a ghost town. The historic building, which dates back to 1928, stands in silence with farewell messages from traders scrawled on the walls where they worked.

Mr Wright said a major consideration were the ruins of the former castle as well as shops nearby which are staying open, and there may be some road closures during the work. The market’s retaining wall will also be kept as it holds back the hill on which the castle was built.

"Ever since humans first gazed up at the stars, we have been fascinated by the Man in the Moon. The ancient Chinese thought the lonely soul staring down at them was a goddess stranded after consuming an immortality potion. Early Christians believed it was the face of man banished for collecting firewood on the Sabbath. The shapes making up the 'face' of the Man in the Moon are likely to have been created by magma bubbling up to the moon’s surface, new research reveals. This image shows a full moon as seen from the Earth, with the Procellarum border structures of 'face' superimposed in red . And medieval Englishmen held him to be the god of drunkards, a lunar being with a special taste for claret. More recently scientists have assumed the circles forming the image of a face were formed by asteroid strikes. But now, at long last, we are close to the truth. The famous shapes are likely to have been created by magma bubbling up to the moon’s surface, new research reveals. The 1,800-mile-wide (2,897km) section of the moon’s Procellarum basin was formed by large plumes of molten rock, the US scientists believe. The ancient Chinese thought the lonely soul staring down at them was a goddess stranded after consuming an immortality potion, while early Christians believed it was the face of man banished for collecting firewood on the Sabbath. This image shows the marking most people see as the face's eyes, nose and mouth . Experts found that the circles were not made by asteroids but sharp angles produced by giant tension cracks in the moon’s crust as it cooled around upwelling plumes of hot material from the deep interior (illustrated) The circles were not formed by asteroid strikes, as previously thought. Instead, they are likely to have been created by magma bubbling up to the moon’s surface . The 1,800-mile-wide section of the moon’s Procellarum basin was formed by large plumes of molten rock. The circles are made up of sharp angles produced by giant tension cracks in the moon’s crust as it cooled around upwelling plumes of hot material from the deep interior. As the cracks occurred, they formed a ‘plumbing system’ in the moon’s crust through which magma could meander to the surface, one expert said. Magma eventually filled the region’s smaller basins, creating what we see today as dark spots on the near side of the moon. These are the features which inspired the idea of a man in the moon. The latest theory, published in the journal Nature, was established by analysing high-definition maps of the moon’s surface. Using Nasa data, a research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that the circles are not circular - as would be the case if they were caused by asteroids. The researchers discovered that they are instead made up of sharp angles produced by giant tension cracks in the moon’s crust as it cooled around upwelling plumes of hot material from the deep interior. Maria Zuber, MIT’s vice president for research, says that as cracks occurred, they formed a ‘plumbing system’ in the moon’s crust through which magma could meander to the surface. Magma eventually filled the region’s smaller basins, creating what we see today as dark spots on the near side of the moon. These are the features which inspired the idea of a man in the moon. Professor Zuber said: ‘A lot of things in science are really complicated, but I’ve always loved to answer simple questions. Medieval Englishmen held the Man in the Moon be the god of drunkards, a lunar being with a special taste for claret, while the character also figures in children's books watching over people on Earth . Magma eventually filled the region’s smaller basins, creating what we see today as dark spots on the near side of the moon. This image shows the moon seen in visible light (left), topography (centre, where red is high and blue is low), and gravity gradients (right). The Procellarum region is a broad region of low topography . ‘How many people have looked up at the moon and wondered what produced the pattern we see - let me tell you, I’ve wanted to solve that one!’ The map was created using twin probes that orbited the moon from January to December 2012 and was used to determine where the lunar crust thickens and thins. They found that the rim of the Procellarum region is composed of edges made up of 120-degree angles. An asteroid strike would create circular or elliptical craters and not these angular shapes, the team suggests. But parts of the mystery remain. Professor Zuber said: ‘How such a plume arose remains a mystery. It could be due to radioactive decay of heat-producing elements in the deep interior. ‘Or, conceivably, a very early large impact triggered the plume. But in the latter case, all evidence for such an impact has been completely erased. ‘People who thought that all this volcanism was related to a gigantic impact need to go back and think some more about that.’","Scientists had assumed the circles forming the image of the Man in the Moon's face were formed by asteroid strikes .

"New Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis (pictured) wants to stop customers deserting for discounters Lidl and Aldi . Top executives at Tesco have been forced to shop and cook like housewives as part of a plan to put them back in touch with their customers. The bosses were sent food shopping at Tesco and at all its main rivals then whisked away to a small, remote holiday cottage in Norfolk. The plan was the brainchild of Dave Lewis, who took over the chief executive job at Tesco last month, in an effort to encourage his 15 most senior executives to see the business from the point of view of ordinary shoppers. He arrived seven weeks ago only to be faced with a massive profits slide at the company and a shock accounting scandal that has rocked the stock market and seen Tesco shares slump. But he wants to quickly find ways to stop customers deserting for German discounters Aldi and Lidl and to sweep away a culture at Tesco that included operating six corporate jets. He is already close to selling two of them. Mr Lewis told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I think if you’re in our business and you’re not spending all of your time looking at the quality and the presentation and the taste of the food and the products you serve – what are you doing?’ ‘I took my executive team away for a day and a night. It’s been a very frenetic time and I wanted to get to know the people and talk about where the business was and where it was heading. ‘So I took them off to a tiny self-catering place in Norfolk. ‘Let’s just say it was a damn sight cheaper than most hotels would cost you.’ Scroll down for video . Among those present were acting UK chief Robin Terrell; Trevor Masters, who runs the company’s £10 billion Asian business; Tesco bank chief Benny Higgins; group property director Steve Rigby; group corporate affairs director Rebecca Shelley and David Hobbs, group business planning director. Apart from discussing strategies, they also prepared meals. ‘I said to them, “You two get breakfast for the group, you do lunch and we’ll do dinner.” ‘The meals had to come from Tesco and the competition so we as an exec group had a hands-on experience of going shopping, buying, preparing, eating and we sat and we looked through it all.’ Mr Lewis also wants thousands of head office staff to spend one day a fortnight in stores over Christmas . As another part of his overhaul of company culture, Mr Lewis wants thousands of staff at the head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, to spend one day a fortnight in stores in the run-up to Christmas. He explained: ‘I’m trying to get the business to make time for and think about – if they weren’t doing already – the things that matter from a customer point of view ... service, availability, quality.’","Executives forced to shop and cook to get them in touch with customers .

"The Swedish prime minister clearly has some first-day-at-work nerves as he managed to mess up his first international press conference this week. Stefan Löfven was introducing fellow Scandinavian and Baltic leaders when he forgot their names, and was caught on camera desperately mumbling to an aide for help. The Social Democratic leader managed to correctly introduce Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt, but when he came to Estonia's Foreign Trade Minister Anne Sulling he went silent. It all started so well: Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven addresses his first international press conference and begins to introduce leaders form the other Scandinavian countries and the Baltic states... ... Social Democratic Party leader Löfven manages to correctly identify his Danish counterpart, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and then it all goes wrong . Giggles on stage: Estonia's Foreign Trade Minister Anne Sulling clearly finds the funny side as Mr Löfven, in a heavy Swedish accent, blames his paperwork . Although Swedes are known for their proficiency in the English language, this was clearly not Löfven's favourite subject at school. Realising he does not remember Sulling’s name, he starts fumbling with his notes before confessing: ’I think I've been given the wrong paperwork.’ Stuttering in a heavy accent, the newly elected former welder has to ask for help from his press secretary. Not until he is given a new note he can return to presenting the other politicians, who can be seen giggling on stage. Stefan Löfven, 57, was elected prime minister in September this year, but despite now being the leader of one of Europe’s most successful economies, he has never been a member of parliament, let alone been in government. Help: After blaming 'the wrong papers', Löfven asks his press secretary Odd Guteland for help . Finally: After some theatre-whispering and a new note, Löfven can introduce the other politicians . The former welder, who has been active in the Social Democratic Party since his early teens, worked as a trade union leader before being elected party leader. After forming a coalition with the Greens and the former communist Left Party, he won around 40 percent of the vote in elections that took place in mid-September. The mistake by the new leader was slammed by social media users across the region after footage of the event was shown on Swedish news website Dagens Nyheter and other news sources. The summit had been called to discuss Russia's growing military presence in the Baltic and Sweden's controversial decision to recognise Palestine as a state. Fortunately for Löfven, after speaking with a press officer he recovered his composure and presented Sulling and the other international attendees.","Sweden's Stefan Löfven messed up first international press conference .

"Martha Stewart is recovering from the loss of her CEO to rival Gwyneth Paltrow by axing up to 50 employees. The cuts will hit the sales and marketing departments at Martha Stewart Omnimedia hardest while some workers will be moved to Meredith Corporation. Last week, the 73-year-old's former CEO Lisa Gersh was hired by Paltrow's lifestyle company GOOP, which is currently engaged in a vicious media war with Martha's brand. Scroll down for video . Martha Stewart, right, is axing 50 staffers just one week after losing CEO Lisa Gersh to Gwyneth Paltrow's GOOP lifestyle brand. Pictured here in 2011 . But staffers were shocked to find out the news because the layoffs had been such a well-kept secret, a source told the New York Daily News. It's not the first time Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia has shaken things up in a significant way. Last year, nearly 100 people were handed pink slips just before the holiday season, and in 2012 the company let 70 workers go in November. 'They want (laid-off workers) to keep coming in through October 31, then they get (paid for) 60 days after that, but I can't see anyone going in,' said the source. 'I can't imagine Meredith will have a use for all those people.  I think those people have to know the writing is on the wall. 'It was a big deal. There were people crying.' Stewart's comeback was in the form of a recipe for a pie called 'Conscious Coupling,' a clear dig at Paltrow's split from Chris Martin . Last year, Martha sparked the feud with Gwyneth by questioning GOOP entering the competitive arena of celebrity lifestyle brands which she thought she had reigned over for so many years. And last month, Martha mocked Paltrow saying she 'just needs to be quiet'. 'She's a movie star. If she were confident in her acting, she wouldn't be trying to be Martha Stewart.' But Gwyneth soon responded: 'I'll try to recover. 'If I'm really honest, I'm so psyched that she sees us as competition. I'm so psyched. I really am.' The feud continued in the latest issue of Martha Stewart Living, where she mocked the Iron Man star by making a reference to Gwyneth's well-known 'conscious uncoupling' quip - a clear dig at her separation from husband Chris Martin in March. In the November issue, Martha titled one of the pages 'Conscious Coupling' to describe the 'perfect marriages of crust and filling' when it comes to making a pie.

"A celebrated set of church bells have been silenced after market traders operating in the area complained that the three hours of deafening chiming lost them valuable business. The ten bells at St Laurence Parish Church in Stroud, Gloucestershire, were chiming in a rare full peal as a gesture of goodwill to the local community. But the relentless noise was not appreciated by workers at The Shambles Market - which has been a permanent fixture in the church's vicinity every Friday and Saturday since the 16th century. St Laurence Parish Church in Stroud, Gloucestshire, has received a letter of complaint after its bells chimed for three hours on Saturday . Andy Soutar, of the Global Organic fruit and vegetable stall which backs on to the church's gates, said: 'It went on for more than three hours. 'Apart from us not being able to think, there was a definite line in the market where people were not going. 'They just wouldn't go in to that space because of the noise.' Mr Soutar complained to the church after Saturday's three-hour bombardment but claims he is yet to receive a response. Local traders at The Shambles Market, which lies in the grand church's shadow, (the steeple can be seen in top left of picture) said their customers were being driven away by the deafening sound of continuous ringing . The Shambles Market in Stroud, Gloucestershire, features rows of outdoor stalls lined along The Shambles - the road which leads up to the church . He added: 'I am not against bell ringing or the church but this did go on for quite a long time and it affected trade. 'I hope some compromise can be found.' The next big peal was scheduled for November with a visiting bell-ringing team set to do the honours. A peal is the name given to a specific type of performance of change ringing, the art of ringing a set of tuned bells in a series of mathematical patterns. For a performance to be recognised as a peal it must consist of at least 5040 changes on up to seven working bells. The event has now been cancelled to the dismay of St Laurence's regular church-goers. Ron Cree, who runs the indoor market in St Laurence Church Hall, said he was not affected. He said: 'We could not really hear it inside. I heard that some market stall holders outside had written to the church because it got on their nerves a bit.' Team rector, Reverend Malcolm King and church wardens Deirdre Baker and Mike Lambert issued a statement in response. 'St Laurence Church has 10 bells - there are not many local churches with that number and of course the bells become popular for visiting bell ringers,' the statement read. 'On the morning of September 27 a visiting bellringer team managed to ring a full peal - quite an achievement in itself - which lasted for three hours and five minutes. 'This is the first time a full peel has been rung on a Saturday morning for quite a while. 'We understand that certain outside market stall holders found it difficult to hear for the length of time the peal was rung.

"The property market in Sydney continues to amaze with a recent buyer forking out over $600,000 for a one bedroom apartment that was just a mere 38 square metres. The one-bedder, one bathroom abode in Potts Point, inside the Gemini building, equip with killer views of the Harbour, fetched $54,000 above its reserve, selling for $684,000 at auction on the weekend. The sale of 39/40 Victoria street even surprised the real estate agent who sold the property, McGrath agent Richard Bonouvrie saying it was a record for a one bedroom in the building. 'At auction there were five bidders but I definitely think it sold for that much because of the view,' he said. The Potts Point apartment had stunning views of the Harbour and bridge. It sold for $684,000 at auction . 39/40 Victoria street Potts Point may have had great views but it wasn't very big at only 38 square metres (pictured) which is about $18,000 per square metre . 'Also the amount of sunlight coming in, the position (of the apartment), it was quiet desirable.' 'The view is amazing and it makes all the difference.' At that price it represents $18,000 a square metre for the 38 square metre apartment. It's history is that it was last traded in 2007 at $405,000 (a 68% gain over seven years) when bought by the property developer Peter Gaunt and his partner, vet Dr Kevin Foster. 'Peter lived in it for a few years and then moved to Melbourne and rented it out. It then became vacant and he tried to sell it,' said Mr Bonouvrie. 'He rented it at $600 then tried to lease it higher but couldn't find anyone to rent and then decided to sell it.' 'The rental market is a bit slow in the inner city market.' Laura Bitar who was also the other agent on the property, said,'he did try to lease the apartment for 600 per week... And we would expect the apartment to lease for somewhere between $550 and $600 on the current market.' The apartment had an open lounge and dining (pictured) and was sold for $54,000 over the reserve . The one bedroom apartment reached a record sale price for the Gemini Building that it was situated in, selling at auction for $684,000. The perks are a rooftop terrace with a pool (pictured) It was a one bedroom, one bedroom apartment. It had a master double bedroom with an ensuite (pictured) Ms Bitar said the price guide was above $580,000 for 39/40 Victoria street. 'The Gemini Building was designed by Harry Seidler, a well known Sydney architect who designed many of our landmark residential and commercial buildings. The building was built in the 1970's,' she said. 'There were 58 apartments in the block.' It's selling point was stated as 'capturing breath taking views and stylishly finished for modern living'. Before being sold, McGrath real estate said on realestate.com.au, that 'this inviting apartment defines ultra convenient, low maintenance living'. 'Privately and quietly set at the exclusive north end of Victoria street, it is just a stroll to the city.' It's believed the stunning views (pictured) is what got this apartment $684,000 . The apartment was very modern with all the comforts but was only 38 square metres . The apartment includes a double master bedroom with built-ins and a luxury ensuite, combined lounge and dining area open to the view, Caesar stone kitchen with electric appliances, security intercom. And residents there will even have access to a rooftop terrace with pool and barbeque area, although one thing missing is a car space, but it's description does says there is ample scramble parking. The building's highest prior sale was $560,000 which was put up for rent at $590 a week before being lowered.","A 38 square metre apartment in Potts Point sells for $684,000 at auction .

"Megan Robinson, 19, was one of those killed, along with Citroen driver, Anne Peachey . A 'boy racer' has been jailed for causing the death of three women - just two weeks after a pedestrian was seriously injured because of his speeding. Jak Parker, 23, from County Durham, was speeding at more than twice the limit when he overtook a Fiat 500 in  Shotton Colliery -  driving his MG ZR car at over 70mph in a 30mph zone. The Fiat subsequently collided with a Citroen Xsara, trapping three people inside. Fiat driver Rebecca Learoyd and her front seat passenger and best friend Megan Robinson, both 19, were killed, along with the Citroen driver, 60-year-old Anne Peachey. And Teesside Crown Court heard that Parker's street racing had already caused a woman crossing a road to be seriously injured two weeks before. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, sentencing Parker, said his actions had shattered the lives of three families. He was jailed for 10 years after admitting three counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and a further two and a half years for causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The court heard Parker's driving egged Ms Learoyd on to drive at speed, and having got into a race with him, she lost control after he had overtaken, and her Fiat hit the Citroen head-on. Grandmother Ms Peachey died in an air ambulance on the way to hospital after the crash in June last year. Her daughter Joanne and granddaughter were also in the car and in statements described their horror at being trapped as her life ebbed away. Parker admitted a separate charge of causing serious injury by dangerous driving on June 8 last year. He was driving the same car when a pedestrian suffered a leg injury as she used a crossing in Wheatley Hill. She was struck by a van driven by Roy Morrison, 20, who lives on a caravan site near Chester-le-Street. The 'boy racer' overtook a Fiat 500 in Front Street, Shotton Colliery, driving his MG ZR car at over 70mph in a 30mph zone.The Fiat subsequently collided with a Citroen Xsara, trapping three people inside . The judge said Parker's driving was not the sole cause of the fatal accident, but a substantial part. Morrison was jailed for three and a half years after he was convicted of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Judge Bourne-Arton told Parker: 'By your actions on that day in June, you have shattered the lives of three families. 'Three families who have lost respectively, a daughter, a mother, a wife, a grandmother. 'You may or may not be able to put the events of that day from your mind. They never will. 'The consequences of your actions will remain with them. 'You deprived them of their loved ones by driving in the most dangerous of fashions.' Parker was guilty of a prolonged piece of dangerous driving over a significant distance on that damp evening as he drove from Wingate to Peterlee. Witnesses described seeing his car 'fishtail' around corners in the wet. Fiat driver Rebecca Learoyd (left) and her front seat passenger and best friend Megan Robinson (right), both 19, were killed in the crash . He drove at over 70mph through 30mph zones at a time when there were other road users about. Parker drove up too close behind Miss Learoyd, making her speed up. 'In short, you were racing,' the judge said. 'You essentially were egging her on to drive at greater speed. 'You overtook when it was dangerous to do so.' A black box recovered from her wrecked car showed she had been travelling at up to 77mph although she slowed down in the seconds before the crash. Jak Parker caused a horrific crash which killed three women - just two weeks after he mowed down a pedestrian . He said although Miss Learoyd's Fiat, which had previously been written off and is now subject of separate legal proceedings, had faults, these would not have been a problem if she had not been travelling so fast - 'a speed caused by you racing her', the judge said. The judge said Parker's driving on the night the pedestrian was hurt was also 'appalling' as he and Morrison raced along. Their victim described the agony she suffered as her right kneecap was shattered in the collision. Robin Turton, prosecuting, said police analysis showed there was no single cause of the crash, but speed, inexperience, wet conditions and the undulating road were factors. He said a 'red mist' may have descended on Miss Learoyd, and Mr Turton said: 'It is likely Rebecca was drawn in to the competitive element of the event.' In a victim impact statement her father John said he had lost his best friend, his only child, and not a day went by without him thinking of his loss. Joseph Peachey, Anne's widower, said in his statement: 'It's hard to be strong when the person who gave you your strength is missing. 'I know it is what Anne would want so I have to try.' The driver of the Citroen, grandmother Anna Peachey, died in an air ambulance on the way to hospital after the crash in June last year . Jacqueline Robinson, the mother of 19-old Megan Robinson who was killed speaking outside of Teesside Crown Court surrounded by other family members of the victims who died . He said his loss was indescribable. Jacqueline Robinson, Megan's mother, read her statement out to the court, and said she invited her daughter's friends to see her in intensive care to show them the dangers of speeding. She said her daughter was 'wonderfully loud and vibrant', adding: 'In our house now there is only sadness.' Stephen Constantine, for Parker, said his client's probation report described his remorse, and his desire to explain to the victims' families what happened, although he realised that was unlikely to be possible. Glenn Gatland, for Morrison, said although his client maintained he was not responsible for the pedestrian's injuries, he was not an uncaring, arrogant young man.","Jak Parker 'egged on' driver Rebecca Learoyd, enticing her into a race .

"How many planets can you fit between Earth and the moon? If your answer was anything less than ‘all of them’ then we’re afraid you're incorrect. In an amazing mosaic image it’s shown how you can fit all other worlds in the solar system between us and our natural satellite, with room to spare. Of course, such a scenario will never actually happen - but it’s surprising to see just how much space there is from here to the moon. This image posted to Reddit shows that all the planets of the solar system could fit between us and the moon. There would even be room to spare to fit a dwarf planet like Pluto. The amazing image highlights just how far the moon is from Earth - at an average distance of 238,555 miles (384,400km) The graphic was posted to Reddit by user CapnTrip. In the image it’s shown how Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would all fit in the gap. The result is a fairly snug fit with about 4,990 miles (8,030km) to spare, using the average Earth-moon distance of 238,555 miles (384,400km). In reality the distance between Earth and the moon varies from 225,622 miles (363,104km) to 252,088 miles (405,696km) - the lower limit of which would not leave room for Neptune. However, Fraser Cain from Universe Today did the maths and found the numbers were a little off, with the actual distance left when using the average Earth-moon distance would be about 2,729 miles (4,392km). This, he says, would be enough to also fit Pluto in the line-up and another dwarf planet except Eris, which is too large. But, in this hypothetical solar system where all the planets have been lined up as shown in the image, what would become of each world? ‘This wonderful line-up would soon degenerate into a single super-planet,’ Professor Michael Smith from the School of Physical Sciences at the University of Kent told MailOnline. ‘First, the rocky planets [Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars] would be cannibalised by Jupiter.’ ‘Then the gas giants [Saturn, Uranus and Neptune] will fall into the murky depths of Jupiter where they create gigantic oscillations, forcing massive shells of material to be ejected. ‘As Saturn then gets swallowed, a massive core would then form, creating a new planet with possibly a quarter of the total mass being ejected. ‘The enormous energy released would light up the galaxy, and all within one glorious week. ‘But thereafter we would be forgotten except for our feeble attempts to communicate with other civilisations that may or may not exist, and possibly don't care whether we do.’ Last year astronomical artist Ron Miller created eye-opening illustrations imagining what the night sky would look like if the moon was replaced by the other planets in the solar system. Here we see how big Jupiter would look in the sky if it were in the position of the moon . This incredible image was taken by Nasa's Juno spacecraft on its way to Jupiter in August 2011. It shows how big the gap is between Earth (the white dot on the left) and the moon (the dot on the right). Here they are 250,000 miles (402,000km) apart. It was taken from a distance of six million miles (9.7 million km) Dr John Bridges from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester told MailOnline that, while the scenario might seem absurd, it is ‘not 100 per cent crazy.’ He says that in other planetary systems some exoplanets may have migrated into the inner regions and, while likely not as extreme as the scenario envisages by Professor Smith, they could have formed giant planets known as Hot Jupiters. ‘So although that never happened in our solar system, something like that has happened [elsewhere],’ he explains. 'Collisions between planetary embryos will certainly have occurred during the formation of exoplanetary systems - as happened in our own. 'However, it would not have occurred not in the extreme way shown in the [mosaic image].' This artist's illustration shows what a Hot Jupiter might look like around another star. These super planets, dozens of which have already been found, can be bigger than Jupiter but orbit closer than Mercury does our own sun, making them exceedingly hot and fascinating to study .","An image posted to Reddit show that all the planets of the solar system could fit between us and the moon .

"It took just two days and a small collection of everyday household items for a group of German hackers to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an Apple iPhone 5S. Chaos Computer Club, based in Berlin, took a high-resolution photograph of a fingerprint from the side of a glass. They then scanned it, before laser printing it onto a transparent sheet and covering it in woodglue. Once the glue had dried, they peeled off the print copy and pressed it on the scanner. Scroll down for video . A fingerprint was photographed using 2400 dpi resolution. The image was inverted and laser printed onto a transparent sheet with a thick toner setting.

He was offering £10,000, alcohol and other prizes for anyone who could hack Apple's new range of security features. The German hacker, nicknamed Starbug, said: 'In reality, Apple's sensor has just a higher resolution compared to the . sensors so far. 'So we only needed to ramp up the resolution of our . fake' 'As we have said now for more than years, . fingerprints should not be used to secure anything.

"A study released Wednesday by a respected Mexican think tank asserts that proposals to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Colorado, Oregon and Washington could cut Mexican drug cartels' earnings from traffic to the U.S. by as much as 30 per cent. Opponents questioned some of the study's assumptions, saying the proposals could also offer new opportunities for cartels to operate inside the U.S. and replace any profit lost to a drop in international smuggling. The ballot measures to be decided on November 6 would allow adults to possess small amounts of pot under a regimen of state regulation and taxation. Three states have ballot proposals to legalize the recreational use of marijuana . Polls have shown tight races in Washington and Colorado, with Washington's measure appearing to have the best chance of passing. Oregon's measure, which would impose the fewest regulations, does not appear likely to pass. The study by the Mexican Competitiveness Institute, ‘If Our Neighbors Legalize,’ assumes that legalization in any state would allow growers there to produce marijuana relatively cheaply and create an illicit flow to other states, where the drug could be made available at cheaper prices and higher quality than Mexican marijuana smuggled across the international border. The report, based on previous studies by U.S. experts including those at the RAND Corporation, assumes that Mexican cartels earn more than $6 billion a year from drug smuggling to the U.S. It calculates the hypothetical, post-legalization price of marijuana produced in Oregon, Washington and Colorado and sold within those states and smuggled to other states. It then assumes that purchasers around the U.S. will choose domestic marijuana when it is sold cheaper than the current price of Mexican marijuana. Across the border: A Mexican report assumes that legalization in any state would facilitate an illicit flow of marijuana to other states. The drug could be available for cheaper than Mexican marijuana smuggled across the border . That choice will lead to a loss of $1.425 billion to the cartels if Colorado legalizes, $1.372 billion if Washington approves the ballot measure, and $1.839 billion if Oregon votes yes, the study says. The only looks at the effects of legalization in individual states, and does not calculate what would happen if more than one legalized marijuana. Opponents of the ballot measures said the study bolsters one of their principal objections, that it will turn any state with legal marijuana into a producer for the rest of the country. They said, however, that they did not believe that production will rob the cartels of significant profits, saying instead that they thought Mexican drug lords would instead try to participate in legal production inside the U.S. ‘If I were a cartel member and I knew Colorado and Washington had it legal, I'd get a couple front people and do my business out of those states. Why would I not?’ said Thomas J. Gorman, head of the Rocky Mountain High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a government agency that coordinates anti-drug efforts by local, state and federal agencies in four Western states. The Mexican government has said that drug legalization in some U.S. states could make it harder to prosecute growers and dealers in Mexico, because they would be producing a product potentially destined for a place where it is legal. Alejandro Hope, an author of the study and a former high-ranking officer in Mexico's domestic intelligence service, acknowledged that the study made a series of assumptions that may not be prove to be true, including the assumption that the U.S. federal government would not aggressively investigate and prosecute movement of marijuana out of a state where it's legal. A post-legalization federal crackdown could make domestically grown marijuana uncompetitive with Mexican pot in many states, he said, meaning cartels would see less of a cut in profits. ‘Diversion is a problem we'll continue to have to monitor,’ said Alison Holcomb, campaign manager with New Approach Washington, the group pushing Washington state's legalization measure. ‘But the question is to the extent that is happening, is it better that the money is going to licensed, regulated businesses instead of going to Mexico?’ A RAND study of a proposal to legalize marijuana in California in 2010 asserted that could cut cartel drug income by 20 percent.","Colorado, Oregon and Washington all have ballot proposals that would legalize recreational use of the drug .

"The teacher who was jailed in August for having sex with four of her students at her home and videotaping it has appeared on Anderson Cooper with her husband to defend her actions. Brittni Colleps, 28, from Texas, spoke from jail where she is serving five years for 16 counts of having improper relationships with students as her husband sat in the studio with Cooper and his special cohost of the day Nancy Grace. The former English teacher at the Kennedale High School has previously spoken out about the incident, saying she is the victim in the case because the students, who were all aged 18, conspired to film their sex romp without her consent and then distributed the footage. Scroll down for video . Grilled: Brittni Colleps (right) spoke to Anderson Cooper (left) and Nancy Grace to defend having group sex with four of her former students . Colleps' husband Christopher, an Army specialist who was away when his wife was having sex with students in May 2011, said he still loves the mother of his three children and has even blamed himself for driving her to commit adultery. Speaking to Anderson Cooper, he said: 'I stand by my wife 100 per cent because as a Christian and believing in God, the bible says I have to love my wife unconditionally as Jesus loved the church. 'We didn't come on here for a bash fest, we came on the show to show how god has fixed our broken marriage. I didn't do the right things as the spiritual leader in my home. 'I blame myself for this situation as I committed adultery before she did. None of us are perfect, all of us are broken people, but if we choose to go back to God and put it in his hands, he will forgive us.' Responding to Anderson Cooper's question as to what she was thinking by carrying out the sex acts with her students, Brittni Colleps said from jail: 'At the time, I really wasn't thinking, I was at a really dark point in my life and there were a lot of other problems going on at the time. I had a lapse of reality and made some bad choices.' Jailed: Colleps (right) spoke from jail as her husband, Christopher, sat in the studio with Anderson . Devastated: Christopher Colleps believes he may be to blame in part for his wife's infidelity . Begged: Christopher (left) had pleaded with the jury to be lenient when sentencing his wife after she was found guilty . When the CNN anchor asked her about the 'pages and pages of texts' she had sent to students, some of which were sent while they were sitting in the classroom with her, she said: 'It wasn't the way it was made out to be, the whole situation lasted over a month and they made it seem like it was the entire school year. It wasn't that at all, it was just at the end of the year.' Nancy Grace joined in and described the messages as 'nasty' and quoted some of them as saying: 'Oh yeah, f*** that p****. Your c*** feels so good in my wet p****' The mother-of-three refused to comment at this point, only to say her case was on appeal which she said she would obviously like to win. 'I accept responsibility for the things I have done wrong and I know people have negative opinions of me but they are not me or who I am and I know I am a changed and better person.' The case against Colleps has garnered national attention, as inappropriate student-teacher relationships have been on the rise across the U.S. For Colleps, it all began with an innocuous text message to a student, asking what time a school game was scheduled to start - but it soon escalated into sexting and at one time Colleps and the unidentified student were exchanging as many as 100 sexually explicit texts a day. Happy family: Brittni (centre) and husband Christopher (right) are still together despite the former teacher's actions . Shamed: There were no rape charges brought against Colleps because all the students involved were over the age of 18 . The lewd communication included messages like, 'I'm an anything goes in sex kinda girl' and 'I like pullin' hair, bitin', scratchin', spanking, I even like being choked,' according to Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Beach. Then in April 2011, Colleps invited this student to come to her home to watch a movie and the two had sex. The student returned to her home on at least four occasions to have sex. In May, he invited three friends from the football team to her home, while her husband and three children were away. According to prosecutors, the teacher stripped down to her lingerie, displayed an array of sex toys and escorted the four young men to her bedroom for a group sex session. Scroll down for excepts of Brittni Colleps' interview with 20/20 . Victim? Brittni Colleps told ABC's 20/20 that the students, who were all aged 18, conspired to film their sex romp without her consent . Not to blame: Colleps insists she is not a sexual predator, in an interview with ABC's 20/20 . According to video footage, taken by . one of the students, 'she's performing one sex act on one student, and . she is simultaneously performing another sex act on another student, and . she has farmed out her kids for the night so that she can have four . students in, and engage in what is more or less an orgy,' Beach . explained. After the encounter, the student began circulating the footage and it made its way to the school's administration. Because . the students were of consenting age, there were no rape charges but . Texas law prohibits an inappropriate relationship between a student and . teacher. At her trial, three of the students testified that they didn't believe she did nothing wrong and that they weren't victims. 'These . were not boys these were not children. These were grown men who . connived, conspired and worked with each other to be with this woman,' Colleps' attorney Lex Johnston had said at her trial. Colleps said earlier: 'I felt like I was victimized in that video, because I did not, I never gave my consent for it,' in an interview with ABC's 20/20. 'I'm not trying to say that it's not wrong or immoral for a teacher to have a sexual relationship with her students  ... but I don't think that in this situation when they were legal, consenting adults - it should not affect me or anyone else legally.' 'In no way, shape or form was I ever preying on anybody. I never coerced anybody to do anything, I never bribed anybody to do anything, I didn't offered grades in exchange for anything.' Colleps' husband Christopher has experienced a roller-coaster ride of emotions since discovering his wife was cheating, in addition to the ensuing criminal case - telling 20/20 that learning of her betrayal was the 'toughest thing I've ever had to hear.' Filled with emotion: 32-year-old Christopher Colleps, in August, wipes away tears as he pleads with the jury to spare his wife from jail . Mercy: Brittni Colleps is overcome as her husband pleads for leniency before her sentencing in August . But the 32-year-old, who testified that he and his wife had engaged in group sex on previous occasions, says he still loves Colleps and he asked the jury to spare his wife from jail. 'I love her with every part of my heart, every ounce of my being,' he told the jury. Guilty: Brittni Colleps was convicted on 16 counts of having improper relationships with students . 'I'm asking that you give her probation... because it's not mine or my children's fault.' Christopher was away at Louisiana’s Fort Polk when his wife was having sex with her students. In the 20/20 interview, the cuckold said that dealing with the aftermath of this affair will be punishment enough for his wife. 'When our children get old enough, she has to look them in the eye and tell them what she did. That is punishment,' he said. Similarly, Colleps mother asked the jury to not sentence Brittni to jail, for the sake of her family. 'I'm asking you to have mercy for her kids cause they need their mom.' Despite her family's pleas, she was . sentenced to five years in prison without parole. For Colleps, it all began with an innocuous text message to a student, asking what time a school game was scheduled to start - but it soon escalated into sexting and at one time Colleps and the unidentified student were exchanging as many as 100 sexually explicit texts a day. The lewd communication included messages like, 'I'm an anything goes in sex kinda girl' and 'I like pullin' hair, bitin', scratchin', spanking, I even like being choked,' according to Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Beach, who also spoke to 20/20.

"Double the trouble: Pennsylvania substitute English teacher Tiffany Leiseth is accused of having sex with two 18-year-old male students just days before graduation . A 26-year-old Pennsylvania substitute English teacher stands accused of sleeping with two of her 18-year-old high school students. New Brighton High School teacher Tiffany Leiseth allegedly slept with the male students on back to back days last May, just hours after final classes but days before graduation. While both students were consenting adults at the time, Leiseth was charged because they had not yet officially graduated and maintained a student-teacher relationship with her. Investigators say Leiseith invited the two students over to home separately, on May 27 and 28, while her husband was away on business. She then offered both minors beer before engaging in intercourse. School district officials started investigating Leiseth on May 30, after another teacher overheard some students talking about obscene photos another male student had received. Also, an unidentified person called police and reported that a female teacher was sending lewd pictures to male students. Police were able to track down the student who had the pictures on his phone, and found that they were sent by Leiseth. But the student in question denied having any sort of sexual relationship with her . Schools Superintendent Joseph Guarino placed Leisith on unpaid leave on June 1, and she was terminated two days later when more pictures surfaced on a different student's phone. That student also claimed he had no sexual contact with Leiseth. Scroll down for video . Scene: The alleged incidents took place on May 27 and May 28, while Leiseth's husband was out of town on business. Investigators said she invited the male students over on different days, offered them beer and then engaged in intercourse . But a fellow teacher reported to police that Leiseth confessed to having sex with both male students. Leiseth was arraigned in court on Monday with two felony counts of having sexual contact with a student and one count of providing alcohol to a minor. Her defense attorney Mike Deriso has issued a statement, saying they will fight the charges. 'She was not their teacher at the time, and they were not her students. My client did not pursue those boys. They are adults. They make their own decisions,' Mr Deriso told KDKA. Superintendent Guarino has since issued a statement saying the school district 'promptly' reported the teacher's actions to police. Fired: Leiseth started as a substitute teacher for the town middle school in 2012-2013, and moved on to the high school the following school year. She has since been terminated . 'The district has provided our complete cooperation with all involved agencies in the matters that were reported and we will continue to do so through the completion of the case. Although we would like to provide further comment, we are unable to do so in light of pending litigation. 'The individual is no longer employed by the district and we are unable to make further comment as this is a personnel matter and the law prohibits us from making comments on matters of personnel.' Leisith began working for the district at a middle school substitute teacher in the 2012-2013 year before being hired as a permanent substitute english teacher for the high school in 2013-2014.

"He was once the world's fattest man weighing in at a staggering 70 stone and consuming up to 20,000 calories a day. But . after losing 48 stone following NHS surgery, Paul Mason has found love with a woman who is determined to raise enough money for his follow-up operation to remove his eight stone of excess skin. Rebecca Mountain, of . Orange, near Boston, Massachusetts, got in touch with 52-year-old Mr Mason via Facebook after she saw a television documentary about . his extreme obesity. And such if the businesswoman's strong love for Mr Mason, that she says that should the potentially life-changing operation to remove his skin end in him being left wheelchair-bound, it would not bother her. We found love: Paul Mason, who was once believed to be the fattest man in the world, has found love online with Rebecca Mountain. They met today for the first time on This Morning . She said in an interview with The . Recorder that far too many people search for relationships 'based on . superficial things … like looks and money … but that means possibly . overlooking what could be an amazing relationship. She . accepts the risk that Mason’s mobility may not improve following the . skin removal operations - which are expected to cost around $16,000 - but says that is something she is prepared to . support him in. Initially the designer could not appreciate just how Mr Mason had become so heavy. She told The Recorder: 'I was never . someone who made fun of heavy people but I am someone who’s been very . judgmental … I thought, how could he let this happen to himself?' But . after seeing just how damaging and severe Paul's addiction was made her . empathise with him, and she was inspired by his determination to lose . weight. And when she learned . of the cost that it would take to remove Mr Mason's excess skin and the . health problems it was causing, she resolved to help by setting up a . web page to help him, and contacted him through Facebook. Reaching out: Rebecca got in touch with 52-year-old Mr Mason via Facebook after she saw a television documentary about his extreme obesity . Speaking on This Morning, Miss . Mountain said as soon as she found out about Paul and his struggle to . get the NHS to remove his excess skin removed she was keen to help: 'I . saw Paul's documentary years and years ago and just felt really . connected right away. 'I just felt compelled to reach out and just try to help and that's all it was. 'I have a lot of drive and just . thought I could write letters and support. Things I set my sights on, I . just go and do. I just knew that I should try and help. 'He's . incredible, a genuine person. Incredibly honest and open about the . difficulties he's been through, which helped our relationship.' Speaking . about how their cyber relationship developed, Paul, of Ipswich, . Suffolk, said: 'Our first chat on Skype was over four hours and it just . felt like we'd been talking for years. 'At the end of the conversation, I just said to her ""what time tomorrow then?"" Mountain said she never found a deep connection with other men and found it tiring trying to meet other men. She said: 'I got exhausted with dating. The people I would date… I didn't like myself as much when I was with them.' At the end of another four-hour Skype conversation with Mason, she announced: 'I really like you,' and the two have been together ever since. As he was: As his weight soared to 70 stone, he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers . Big appetite: At the height of his food addiction, he was eating an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast . After hours of Skye sessions and Facebook chats, the couple met for the first time in real life this week. 'When I met her at the airport, it was far better than the picture you see on Skype, it was so natural - like meeting someone you've met ten years ago,' Paul said. Paul now plans to move to America and help Rebecca with her business. Despite having gastric bypass surgery . four years ago and losing a staggering 48 stone - Paul has been left . with eight stone of excess skin. New man: He has lost 48 stone but has been left with 8 stone of excess skin, which he now wants removed . Speaking . about the operation he needs to remove the skin that stops him from . mobilising, he said: 'To have that operation, I have to prove I am a . stable weight. 'The NHS wait until your weight plateaus, it's a financial thing over here.' A doctor in New York has offered her services to remove his excess skin for free. The only finances he has to find are the aftercare, the stay in hospital and the medication, which will cost around £12,000, which Miss Mountain is now raising on a fundraising web page. Speaking tearfully about the impact of the operation on his relationship, he said: 'It's a question of whether she's prepared to stay with me whether the next operation is successful or not and if I'm in the wheelchair for the rest of my life.' Miss Mountain added: 'Who is in there now is the person I love and whoever he is after the operation is irrelevant to me. 'I want him to achieve his goals and that's the most important thing.' Mr Mason claimed his binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a . deterioration in his mother's health. Mr Mason quit his job as a postman when his weight prevented him from completing his deliveries. As his weight soared he was left unable . to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked . after full time by council carers. Wheelchair bound: Once he has the excess skin removed, he hopes he will be able to get out of bed more easily and be able to walk again . Firefighters had to demolish the front . wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to . lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia . operation in 2002. Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around. At the height of his food addiction, he . was eating an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs . complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast. He would then eat quadruple portions of . fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast . dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening. But he's a new man now and is currently raising the funds he needs before he moves to America. Speaking about his old self, he said: 'That's the old me that I'm moving away from, I am leaving that all behind. 'All the problems I went through were worth it [for love].' Support: He now plans on moving to America with Miss Mountain and help her with her business. He has also been offered a free operation in New York to remove his excess skin .","Paul Mason of Ipswich, Suffolk, weighed 70 stone at his heaviest .

"They were meant to be simple warnings to young people enjoying a summer night out, at a time when alcohol-fuelled sex attacks are at their peak. But West Mercia Police were forced to apologise yesterday after campaigners said the posters for its Safe Night Out initiative suggested rape victims were to blame if they were drunk. One poster pictured a smiling woman above another photo of her lying barefoot and apparently unconscious with her dress riding up her thighs. Controversial: The posters, part of a police campaign, have caused outrage for suggesting that rape victims are to blame if they drink too much . The warning reads: ‘Don’t let a night . full of promise turn into a morning full of regrets.’ Beneath the . woman’s prostrate figure, the poster states: ‘Don’t leave yourself more . vulnerable to regretful sex or even rape. Drink sensibly and get home . safely.’ A second poster aimed at men also . sparked fury, for saying they ‘could’ be breaking the law and arrested . if someone hasn’t given their consent for sex or touching. A senior officer at the Midlands . force, which covers  Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire, . apologised after anti-rape campaigners expressed outrage at the campaign . messages. Around town: Hundreds of the posters were put up in towns like Herefordshire, as well as Shropshire and Worcestershire last month . Jocelyn Anderson, of Worcestershire . Rape and Sexual Assault Support Centre, said: ‘There is no “could be” about it – that’s rape – and to put regretful sex and rape together is . appalling. ‘The problem was the poster put the . blame on to alcohol and women who are raped, suggesting if they didn’t . drink they could avoid rape. Police campaign: The Safe Night Out campaign aimed to encourage young people not to make themselves vulnerable by getting drunk . ‘It’s not alcohol that causes rape, although it’s a vulner- ability factor. It’s rapists that cause rape.’ Hundreds of the posters were put up in . pubs throughout the force area last month to coincide with a . three-weekend spell over July when statistics show drink-fuelled sex . assaults reach an annual peak. Detective Superintendent Ivan Powell admitted there had been ‘some concerns’ about the poster aimed at women. He said: ‘If the campaign has caused distress, that was not our aim and I will apologise for that. ‘This was not about blaming victims but putting information out to help.’ The posters have now been taken down.' Hundreds of the offending posters were put up in pubs in Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire last month. While the police's website links to a webpage dedicated to the campaign and video, the link has been removed. The campaign video features a female rape victim was also released as part of the campaign with the aim of encouraging women to drink less while on a night out.","The posters, which suggest drunk rape victims were to blame, have angered anti-rape campaigners .

"Josie Cunningham is proud of the 36DD taxpayer-funded implants and now hopes to make a career out of showing them off . An aspiring glamour model had her breasts enlarged to size 36DD on the NHS, it emerged yesterday. The surgery to 22-year-old Josie Cunningham, cost taxpayers £4,800. She convinced doctors to operate by claiming her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’ and causing emotional distress. But last night critics were appalled at the decision, branding it a waste of taxpayers’ cash. Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances ‘to protect a person’s health’. Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, says her new breasts have given her the ‘confidence’ she needs to pursue her dream of topless modelling. She hopes to emulate former Page 3 girl Katie Price. The unmarried mother, from Leeds, plans to leave her children Harley, five, and Frankie, two, with her parents while she chases her dream. She told The Sun: ‘My new boobs have changed my life. Now I can’t wait to do topless and swimsuit photoshoots and become the new Katie Price.’ Her operation, at St James’s Hospital in Leeds, was recommended by her GP before being approved by her local Primary Care Trust. But health bosses were unable to say yesterday why such an enormous cleavage was necessary for Miss Cunningham’s wellbeing. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This is an outrageous waste of NHS money . and taxpayers will be appalled that they are having to foot the bill. Scroll down for video . Josie Cunningham, 22, said being a 32A, left, was ruining her life, but now she is a 36DD,right,  she is happy . ‘People expect scarce NHS resources . to be used to help people with serious medical needs, not to subsidise . anyone who fancies a career as a glamour model.’ It is understood Miss Cunningham, . previously a 32A, went to her GP with a ‘congenital medical condition’ which left her with no breast tissue. She said she ‘lived in terror’ of being seen in a bikini and did not feel comfortable venturing out without a padded bra. It is understood Miss Cunningham, previously a 32A, went to her GP with a ¿congenital medical condition¿ which left her with no breast tissue. ‘I was never depressed about my flat . chest,’ Miss Cunningham admitted. ‘I just got emotional when I was . explaining to my GP that I felt I couldn’t live a full life the way I . was – and he agreed to refer me. ‘They gave me a top surgeon. He said . he’d have to give me 36DD implants just to achieve the appearance of a . 36C, because there was literally nothing there in the first place.’ The NHS usually pays for cosmetic . surgery only when it is considered necessary for health reasons. For . instance it will fund breast reduction if the weight of a woman’s . breasts are causing her back problems. However, the criteria for breast enhancement are decided by each local health trust, with no national guidelines available. In Leeds, it can be granted if the woman suffers from developmental failure, or if she has had a mastectomy or lumpectomy. It can also be granted for women with . asymmetric breasts. However, it is unclear whether there is a limit on . how big the implants should be. NHS Airedale, Bradford and Leeds said . it could not comment on individual cases but added: ‘We would like to . clarify that cosmetic surgery is not routinely funded by the NHS.’ The decision in Miss Cunningham’s case would have been made by a panel including clinicians, it said. The Department of Health said: ‘It is . up to the local NHS to decide what treatments to provide but any NHS . treatment needs to be clinically justified.’ Josie Cunningham, wannabe model gets 36DD boobs courtesy of NHS . pictures from Josies open facebook page . St James' Hospital in Leeds where Miss Cunningham had her £4,800 surgery to enlarge her chest . Cosmetic surgery is provided by the NHS only if there is a clinical need . Cosmetic procedures are not normally done on the NHS unless doctors decide there is a clinical need. This decision is taken at a local level, by the Primary Care Trust (PCT), on the basis of reports submitted by a patient's doctors. PCTs set their own criteria according to what, in their view, are the health needs of the local community. For cosmetic surgery, the usual protocol is that the PCT must decide there is some kind of clinical, ie health, need for the operation to be funded on the NHS.  Simply wanting to look nicer in itself is not reason enough. Leeds Primary Care Trust, also known as NHS Leeds, offers a list of cosmetic procedures that may be available on its website.  They include breast augmentation, breast reduction, eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty), and rhytidectomy (wrinkle removal including face lift). It says these may be available 'providing certain criteria can be met', and lists the criteria. The criteria required for breast augmentation include suffering from certain rare syndromes, severe asymmetry (more than two cup sizes difference), or lumpectomy that results in deformity. Rare cases, however, such as Ms Cunningham's, have to be go through the Individual Funding Request process, in which each case is decided upon its individual merits.","Josie Cunningham, from Leeds, told GP being flat-chested ruined her life .

"Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett have been weathering some negative reports lately about their five year marriage that has resulted in two children: Hank Jr, aged four, and Alijah, aged one month. Not only did The National Enquirer claim on Saturday that the 29-year-old Playboy cover girl kicked the former football star out of their Los Angeles home, but on Monday RadarOnline accused the 31-year-old athlete of cheating with transsexual model Ava Sabrina London. Hank reportedly paid the woman $2,500 to keep her mouth shut. This comes on the heels of claims that Jennifer Lopez's boyfriend Casper Smart also cheated with not one, but two transsexuals. Reps for Kendra did not return calls to MailOnline. Scroll down for video... A family rocked by scandal: Hank Baskett, pictured with wife Kendra Wilkinson and son Hank Jr on May 16, has been accused by RadarOnline of cheating with a transsexual in late April - just weeks before this photo was taken . New girl: The woman Hank is accused of having an affair with is transsexual Ava Sabrina London - who also goes by the name Ava S Masaniai - pictured here in a Facebook shot . The first time Hank met Ava, who goes under the YouTube handle Ava Masaniai, was 'around . April 22 in Sherman Oaks, California,' an insider told Radar. 'He called . her twice before they met in person. He said he’d seen her YouTube . videos online, and he couldn’t believe that her photos were real,' the source told Radar. At the time Kendra, who came to fame on E!'s The Girls Next Door, was eight months pregnant with their second child, Alijah, who was born in May. The timing couldn't be any worse: the Kendra On Top stars are set to ring in their five year wedding anniversary on Friday. She likes a good photo: London showing off her assets in revealing bikini top shots she has posted to her social media pages . Suddenly famous?: The knockout has 60 videos on YouTube that will surely get a look at now that she has been linked to the Kendra On Top star . They have so much going for them: The couple, with Hank Jr and new baby girl Alijah, have been together for five years and have yet to comment on new reports their marriage is in trouble . Baskett tried his best to keep the alleged affair a secret. 'He used a fake name when organizing the encounter,' the source told Radar, 'and claimed he had never been with a transsexual before.' He met Ava - who has 60 YouTube videos - at her home. During their first encounter, 'they mutually masturbated' and he touched her 'breasts and penis.' 'The entire encounter lasted probably about 15 to 20 minutes,' Radar's insider claimed. 'Before leaving, he gave her almost $500 and told her he wanted to stay in touch.' United: The family was seen in LA on Saturday afternoon, just hours after the National Enquirer reported the Playboy model kicked him out of their house, forcing him to check into a motel . She used to be in top shape: The blonde no longer looks like the sex symbol she used to be . And in touch they kept. 'They spoke a couple times after their first sexual encounter. Hank always called from different numbers, and at least once from a pay phone,' Radar reported.'After the Casper Smart transsexual controversy, he started to get freaked out and paranoid she would say something, and called her six times in one day to plead with her not to spill.' Lopez broke up with Smart in early June after it was reported he romanced transsexuals Xristina Marie and Sofie Vissa. He denied being with either woman. The 44-year-old singer has since moved on to Dancing With The Stars pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy. Hank used money to keep LA-based London (who studied at Modesto College) quiet, Radar claimed. 'He promised he would take care of her financially, and even left her $2,000 in a coffee cup at her house. 'He promised her $5,000 to keep her mouth shut, and even threatened to kill himself if the story got out!' Kendra, who was last seen with Hank on Saturday as the two ran errands with Alijah, wants to leave him, according to the site. Selfie obsessed: London has several self portraits from her bedroom, and in most of them she's showing off her toned figure that includes a flat stomach and toned legs . On Saturday The Enquirer reported that Hank was spotted speeding away from . their home on Friday and looked 'downtrodden' as he arrived at the motel with bags in hand. The . source told the publication: 'He went into the office of the motel and . then pulled the jeep around to the other side where the room was . located. Hank appeared disoriented and downtrodden. At one point, he . kicked the ground.' A new trend?: Jennifer Lopez's boyfriend Casper Smart, pictured in May, was also accused of seeing not one, but two transsexuals . The . Enquirer claimed Hank was joined by a woman wearing a 'medical type . uniform' and speculated it could be one of the children's nurses. The . insider said: 'He got out of the Jeep with a woman who appeared to . possibly be one of the couples’ baby nurses because she was wearing a . medical type uniform. 'An hour later, he emerged from the room but then returned back inside.' Hank spent most of Friday with his father Hank Sr at a Major League Gaming Competition in Anaheim. He tweeted: Mornin yall! @MrHankBaskettSr . & I are on our way down to the #MLGAnaheim championships. Small . road trip with pops=good times.' No idea what was coming! Kendra shared this upbeat tweet on Thursday . Family time: Hank spent the morning with his father before returning to the family home and quickly leaving for a local motel . He later wrote on Instagram: '#MLGAnaheim. The calm before the storm. Best of luck to mlg and all those playing this weekend!' However, after returning to the house, Hank abruptly left the property at 4pm for the motel. There was no sign of his father. The . allegations of marital discord come just one day after Kendra took to . Twitter to post an upbeat message, writing: 'Today will be a great day. I . know it. #CarpeDiem #smile #happiness #love #positivevibes.' And earlier on Friday she flashed a happy smile as she stepped out in baggy sweats that covered up her postpartum figure. Kendra and Hank married June 27, 2009 and welcomed Hank Jr in December of the same year. The blonde has spilled her family secrets on Kendra and Kendra On Top. It is not yet known if she could turn her new alleged marital woes into a reality spinoff much like Tori Spelling has done. No smiles here: The athlete and the model looked to be in a tense mood as they went out with daughter Alijah on Saturday afternoon .

"Louis van Gaal frustration over losing the majority of his squad to international duty for the next 10 days has been compounded by the fact that Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo must travel to the Far East with Argentina for two exhibition games. Van Gaal desperately wants to work with his players after admitting that United’s second-half performance was below standard in Sunday’s 2-1 win over Everton at Old Trafford. A number of them – including Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans, Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick and Ashley Young – are still recovering from injury, while many more will not report back to Carrington until the middle of next week. Angel di Maria must travel to the Far East with Argentina during the two-week international break . Di Maria's compatriot Marcos Rojo will also have to take part in two exhibition games in the Far East . Van Gaal appreciates the need for players to balance their commitments to club and country from his time as Holland coach, and is also fortunate that United do not play their next match at West Brom until Monday, October 20. But it clearly rankles that Di Maria and Rojo have to travel so far to play in Argentina’s friendlies against Brazil in Beijing on Saturday and then face hosts Hong Kong three days later. Discussing United’s poor second-half display against Everton, Van Gaal said: ‘That is why we have to train, but now all my players are gone. The rest are injured so we cannot train. Now I have to wait. Louis van Gaal (right) will lose the majority of his squad to the 10-day international break . ‘Di Maria and Rojo are coming back from Hong Kong.

"One of Britain’s highest paid executives prompted outrage last night by insisting that his £1million basic salary is 'very low’. Sir Martin Sorrell, head of advertising giant WPP, rejected criticism of executive pay in the wake of a study showing it rose by almost 50 per cent in the past year. David Cameron described the huge increases commanded by bosses at a time when ordinary workers have had their incomes squeezed as 'disturbing’. High flying: Sir Martin Sorrell, pictured with his wife Lady Cristiana, said his pay as head of advertising giant WPP is very low . And Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was a 'slap in the face’ for employees, seizing on the astonishing rise as evidence that tax cuts for the low paid should take priority over scrapping the 50p top tax rate. But Sir Martin, 66, said his bumper income, which rose by 83 per cent to £4.2million last year, was fully justified and was mostly linked to the firm’s performance. He added that he considered his basic salary, of just over £1million, to be 'very low’. Condemnation: Nick Clegg (left) and David Cameron have both said bumper pay rises for Britain's top bosses are unacceptable . But his comments astonished MPs and . infuriated union leaders. Labour education spokesman Karen Buck . described the huge rise in executive pay as 'grotesque’, adding: 'What . planet do these people live on?’ Deborah . Hargreaves, chair of the High Pay Commission which is looking into . executives’ remuneration, said the performance-related pay deals enjoyed . by executives 'don’t really work’. Commenting . on the study by the research group Income Data Services, she added: 'I . think it is very hard to justify these sorts of pay increases when we . have seen companies’ share prices go down, profits down, companies . laying off staff, and when average wages are going up 1 or 2 per cent, . not even keeping up with price rises.’ But in an interview with the Daily Mail, Sir Martin angrily defended his bumper pay packet. He . said: 'The only planet I am living on is looking at our company in . terms of the competition – that’s the planet. We need to maintain a . competitive position. The UK only accounts for 12 per cent of our . business. We have more Brazilians, Russians, and Indians than we have . Americans and Brits. 'In 2009 it was a tough year for us and compensation across the board fell. In 2010 we delivered record profit. 'People are not distinguishing . between fixed pay and incentive pay. I don’t sell my stock. Other . people, including our competitors, do.

"She made a president blush on his birthday and whole nations of men swoon whenever she appeared on screen. And it seems the charms of Marilyn Monroe have not been muted even 50 years after her death. America's legendary style icon has been crowned queen of the fuller busts by British lingerie shoppers, successfully beating three of our own well-cleavaged beauties to the top spot. Perfect curves: Marilyn Monroe beat actresses including Scarlett Johansson, Mad Men's Christina Hendricks and Sophia Loren to the top spot . The actress and singer - who appeared . in 1950s comedies including Some Like It Hot and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes - was . closely trailed in the cleavage league table by TV presenter and host . of This Morning, Holly Willoughby, often lovingly nicknamed Holly Willoughbooby. British actress and model Liz Hurley came third, followed in fourth place by voluptuous stunner Kelly Brook, who recently designed a New Look clothing line for women with more realistic figures. Italian septuagenarian and screen Icon Sophia Loren came fifth on the list, with Vicky Christina Barcelona star Scarlett Johansson, Mad Men's favourite redhead Christina Hendricks and singer Beyonce placed sixth, seventh and eighth respectively. Cleavage queen: Marilyn Monroe is the star with the best bust in town, according to lingerie shoppers . Best of British: Holly 'Willoughbooby' Willoughby was the highest-ranking British woman in the poll . The poll was collated by high street retailer Debenhams in light of the realisation that over half of their female customers wear a bra size DD or higher. The shop asked 1,000 customers, both male and female - all of whom were shopping in their fuller-bust lingerie range, Gorgeous - which famous female they thought had the best cleavage. Sharon Webb, Head of Lingerie Buying and . Design for Debenhams, said: 'If you’ve got it flaunt it, but reveal your . assets appropriately. 'It’s no surprise that Marilyn was voted number . one; she clearly wore well fitting bras and never made a boob of . herself; she knew how much decolletage to bear. 'For most women, . there is nothing that says fashion disaster like a bra that doesn't fit . properly and if you’re blessed with a fuller chest and not so keen on . the beach ball bust trend, then this can be a challenge.' Out and proud: Actress and model Liz Hurley was placed higher up the poll for best cleavage than screen goddess Sophia Loren and burlesque star Dita Von Teese . If you've got it, flaunt it: British Model Kelly Brook ranked fourth in the poll for busty idols, voted for by women buying Debenhams' fuller-bust lingerie line, Gorgeous .

The curvaceous, 31-year-old mother of two has become a household name presenting TV shows Dancing On Ice and This Morning. 3.    Liz Hurley . Gone are the days when she'll squeeze herself into a dress made of safety-pins, but the British model still enjoys flaunting her assets. 4.    Kelly Brook . She's just designed a summer line of clothes for curvy girls in New Look, so it's no wonder fuller-figured females love the sunny model. 5.    Sofia Loren . She's pushing 80, but that doesn't mean the Academy Award-winning actress has lost those killer curves. 6.    Scarlett Johansson . The American actress is just 27 and has one of our favourite figures in showbusiness. 7.    Christina Hendricks .

"Mats Hummels looks set to join Manchester United this week from Borussia Dortmund for a reported £16million, according to reports in Spain. The two clubs remain locked in talks ahead of the prospective move, but the Old Trafford hierarchy are confident off thrashing out a deal for the highly-rated defender.

It later emerged that Ed Woodward left Manchester United's tour of the United States for 'general business reasons'. Less than 24 hours after telling United fans new signings would be coming to Old Trafford this summer, the club's executive vice-chairman decided he would head back to the UK on Monday night. Woodward left the club's tour last summer because of what was described at the time as 'urgent transfer business'. But this time, United insist Woodward's departure from the four-match tour is due to 'general business reasons' and is not due to a specific imminent transfer. With both Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand departing the club this summer, United are in desperate need of some experience at the back and despite being just 25, Hummels will provide just that after playing at the highest level domestically and internationally for many years.

"Jeremy Lin says racism may have played a role in the reaction to his rise to fame in New York, as he hopes to keep Linsanity alive in a different jersey - since he was cast out of the city he loves. The Houston Rockets point guard, who became one of the Big Apple's biggest stars during his time with the Knicks last year, is opening up about his journey from Harvard to Madison Square Garden to Houston - and the couches in between. Last year, Lin, the NBA's first American-born player of Taiwanese or Chinese descent,said he may have been headed to Europe if he had not been given a chance with the Knicks. Rocket man: Jeremy Lin drives the ball against the San Antonio Spurs' Tony Parker during their preseason game on Saturday . New team: Lin was picked up by the Houston Rockets after the New York Knicks ultimately decided that the Linsanity fan frenzy was too big for the team's wallet . Speaking to GQ magazine, Lin claimed that race had a lot to do with why his sudden fame. He said: 'There’s a lot of perceptions and stereotypes of Asian-Americans that are out there today, and the fact that I’m Asian-American makes it harder to believe, even crazier, more unexpected. 'I’m going to have to play well for a longer period of time for certain people to believe it, because I’m Asian. And that’s just the reality of it.' Lin joined the Houston Rockets in July after the Knicks announced that they would not match the Rockets' three-year, $25million offer for the restricted free agent. Cover boy: Lin has opened up to GQ magazine about racism in basketball, his rise to fame in New York and leaving the city he loves . But for a man about to begin a new chapter in his NBA career, there is still a great amount of sadness about leaving New York and its basketball fans. Lin told GQ: 'You can't ask for a city or a fan base to embrace somebody more than they embraced me. I know it's kind of silly to talk about it with only two years under my belt in the league, but going in before free agency, I was like, ""I want to play in front of these fans for the rest of my career."" I really did. 'I really wanted to play in front of the Madison Square Garden fans for the rest of my career, because they’re just unbelievable.' The 23-year-old point guard, undrafted out of Harvard, became an international phenomenon and the biggest story in sports during just one dazzling month in the Big Apple. But the Knicks ultimately decided that the Linsanity fan frenzy was too big for the team's wallet. Lin proved to be much more than just a one-hit wonder in New York - he had 28 and 23 points in his first two NBA starts, and then scored a career-high 38 in a 92-85 victory over Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers. The stock price for Madison Square Garden Inc. surged on the production and popularity of the team's international star. He also made the Sports Illustrated cover in consecutive weeks, only the 12th athlete to hold that distinction since 1990. It won't be the first time Lin has . donned a Rockets jersey. He played with the team for a total of two . preseason games last year before he was placed on waivers and later . claimed by the Knicks. Winning streak: Lin was one of the Knicks' key players last season, averaging 14.6 points a game when he went up against some tough teams like the Los Angeles Lakers . The 23-year-old point guard, undrafted out of Harvard, became an international phenomenon and the biggest story in sports during just one dazzling month in the Big Apple. But the Knicks ultimately decided that the Linsanity fan frenzy was too big for the team's wallet. Rockets general manager Daryl Morey celebrated the re-acquisition on Twitter, saying: 'Welcome to Houston (at)JLin7. We plan to hang on this time. You will love (hash)RedNation.' The Rockets actually waived Lin after two weeks in their training camp in December. Team owner Leslie Alexander said in a statement in July that the team was 'thrilled to have Jeremy back.' The Knicks said they would match any offer to retain Lin, but the Rockets made it tough for New York to keep him by backloading their offer sheet with a $15 million salary in the third season. If the Knicks agreed to that deal, they would've faced a hefty luxury tax in 2014-15 because of other big contracts on their books - between $30-40 million. One sports consultant said the adjustment to the offer sheet was a stroke of genius by Rockets GM Daryl Morey. 'The Rockets deserve a lot of credit for the way they've gone about this,' said Marc Ganis, president of Chicago-based SportsCorp. 'It was extremely intelligent - with an assassin's touch.' But Houston made the bad move, initially, waiving Lin because it already had Goran Dragic and Kyle Lowry on the roster. The Knicks picked him up and gave him first real shot. He was briefly demoted to the developmental league, recalled and finally got his chance when coach Mike D'Antoni put him in with the Knicks floundering at 8-15. Lin scored a career-high 25 points in a 99-92 win over New Jersey Nets and 'Linsanity' was born. Lin had slept on teammate Landry Fields' couch the night before, still refusing to get his own place as he headed into that week, knowing the Knicks would have to decide whether to cut him or guarantee his contract for the rest of the season.

"Tube drivers have been offered a bonus of £350 for working on Boxing Day, on top of their salary and paid holiday allowances. The deal has been reached in the long running row between London Underground bosses and drivers over pay and working hours over the festive season. Boxing Day Tube services have been plunged into chaos in recent years because of industrial action by drivers. Tube drivers have been offered a bonus of £350 for working on Boxing Day on top of their salary and paid holiday allowances . London Underground said the agreement . was self-financing because of changes agreed with unions to train . drivers' work and conditions. Phil Hufton, LU's chief operating officer, said: 'In the last three years, train operators decided to take industrial action despite the fact we have a long-standing agreement with all trade unions which covers working arrangements on Bank Holidays, including Boxing Day. 'We have been in discussions with the relevant unions representing the train operators in order to resolve issues around working Boxing Day. 'An agreement was reached with the unions, resulting in a genuine productivity deal. The deal has been reached in the long running row between London Underground bosses and drivers over pay and working hours over the festive season . 'In exchange for changes that would give greater flexibility in the longer term, we have agreed to make an additional payment on the proviso that it would be a completely self-financing deal. 'This cost-neutral deal will be made possible by productivity savings from various parts of the trains operations.' Conservative London Assembly Member Richard Tracey said Transport for London was paying a 'bung' to drivers, adding: 'Since when has a £46K starting salary and 43 days of holiday a year not been enough for Tube drivers? 'This proves that even when strike action does not go ahead, the threat is often used by union bosses to make Londoners suffer. 'The Government needs to urgently ban Tube strikes and replace them with an independent mediation process which protects workers' rights.' Rail Maritime and Transport union general secretary Bob Crow said: 'If Tory politicians think that we are going to take any lectures from them on Tube worker pay and conditions in the week when their colleagues in Parliament have just landed themselves an 11 per cent pay increase then they need to rapidly acquaint themselves with life back in the real world.'","Boxing Day Tube service have been hit by Boxing Day strikes in recent years .

"The former model who was allegedly shot by her boyfriend in a failed murder-suicide after he killed a Utah cop was arrested over the weekend, accused of giving police false stories. Traci Vaillancourt, 34, was arrested on two counts of suspicion of obstruction of justice late on Saturday and spoke to an attorney for the first time since the September 1 incident on Sunday. Vaillancourt - who was disfigured and was left hooked on painkillers after getting a rare blood disease - was allegedly shot in the back by her boyfriend Timothy 'Troy' Walker, 35, while sitting in their Volvo in Draper, Utah. This was just moments after Walker is accused of shooting dead Sgt Derek Johnson, 32. Walker then turned the weapon on himself and was hospitalized. He remains in serious condition. On Saturday Salt Lake County Jail released a probable cause statement saying that investigators spoke with Vaillancourt on Sept. 1, 4 and 7, but all three statements were found to be inconsistent with evidence from the scene. Wheelchair: Vaillancourt was wheeled into court and was breathing with the help of an oxygen tank . Accused: Timothy Walker (left) allegedly shot Sgt. Derek Johnson dead before turning the gun on his girlfriend Vaillancourt (right in an earlier mugshot) and himself . Killed: Father-of-one Sgt Derek Johnson was fatally shot when he stopped alongside Walker's Volvo . Officers suspect the pair were on drugs when Sgt Johnson spotted their car parked awkwardly. Police believe that Walker ambushed Johnson while he was sat in his patrol car. Sgt Johnson was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a 6-year-old son Bensen. His funeral was held on Friday where the community paid tribute to man described as a dedicated public servant. According to the Deseret News, his sister Desirae Johnson said: 'I love you and I am so proud of you for giving your life to what you loved and believe in. I promise I will never forget you and look for signs of you wherever I go.' On Sunday night Vaillancourt met attorney Matthew Kober at the Salt Lake County Metro Jail, also reported by the Deseret News. Kober said the woman being held in the medical unit, in a wheelchair and wearing a sling. According to the lawyer, Vaillancourt is in a lot of pain and on medication. 'I asked a lot of questions. She answered to the best of her recollection,' Kober said. 'This is the first time I've been able to meet with her to understand her side of the story and find out her version of events. We're finding out everything about as quickly as the media is,' he continued. The attorney said that he still needed to talk to police about which of his client's statements they thought were inconsistent. 'There are still some facts I want to follow up and understand better,' Kober said. 'She is aware multiple shots were fired. She expressed her concern for the fallen officer and is in a very emotional state. 'All along we thought she was a victim in this matter,' he added. Tributes: Family and friends paid their respects to Sgt Johnson at his funeral on Friday . Community: Johnson was described as a dedicated public servant in the town of Draper, Utah . Speaking in response to the crime, Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King has revealed her sister's tragic demise from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman reliant on her violent boyfriend. After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister told KSL.com. She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30. 'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster. 'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.' 'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added. Proud dad: Derek Johnson is pictured with his son Bensen . Happily married: Derek Johnson grew up in Draper and married his high school sweetheart. He was described as a dedicated police officer . King last saw her sister and Walker, 35, the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior. 'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said. The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister. They have a daughter together who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother. Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction. 'She would cry, ‘I never pictured my life turning out like this,’' King told the newspaper. According to King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'. Online: In this photograph posted by friends on Facebook they expressed dismay at what had become of the girl they loved, right . She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car. She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' King added in the interview. 'I just want them to know I’m sorry'. Walker has a history of petty crime but nothing that would indicate the murder he is accused of carrying out on Sunday. Vaillancourt too has a record of theft and shoplifting but nothing violent. Crashed: Sgt Johnson drove his car a short distance after being shot, crashing it into a field . Shot dead: A tribute site has been set up to Derek Johnson . 'The streets of Draper City were made safer by Sgt. Derek Johnson who loved his job as a police officer for the Draper City Police Department,' Johnson's family wrote in his obituary. 'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept. 1, 2013, at the age of 32. 'He was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer of the Year. With a good nature, a sense of humor that could light up any room, attention to detail and the ability to make anyone his friend. 'He made a difference. He loved his family, hunting, running, hiking and giving service. He was always up for a good challenge,' it reads. The police officer, promoted last year, tried to drive away after the shooting and crashed his patrol car into a field. The owner, Dan Smith, hung ribbons in his memory. 'There's no words that can explain it and make it ok,' Smith said. 'It obviously tugs at your heartstrings and you want to do something to show that it wasn't in vain.' The local sheriff Jim Winder says Walker had a desire to shoot a uniformed officer.","Traci Vaillancourt was allegedly shot in the back by her boyfriend after he shot dead a police officer .

"She is a classically beautiful award-winning actress who starred in some of the biggest British films of the Nineties.

Kristin Scott Thomas (left) fears she will 'just disappear' now that she has reached middle age. The actress is pictured (right) with Ryan Gosling who she stars alongside in her most recent film Only God Forgives . Miss Scott Thomas, 53, has revealed that she felt ‘invisible’ while surrounded by young actresses at the Cannes Film Festival in May. Voicing the fears of so many women of a certain age, she said: ‘I’m not talking about in a private setting, at a dinner party or anything. But when you’re walking down the street, you get bumped into, people slam doors in your face – they just don’t notice you. ‘Somehow, you just vanish. It’s a . cliché, but men grow in gravitas as they get older, while women just . disappear.’ And echoing Miranda actress Patricia Hodge, who last year . said that all the best roles go to a small group of actresses, she . added: ‘The Great British Dames, like Helen Mirren and Judi Dench, have . all managed to do things marvellously. ‘They go in, swoop up all the attention, and then swoop out again. I could handle that, quite happily.’ Miss Scott Thomas, best known for The English Patient, for which she was Oscar-nominated, and Four Weddings and a Funeral, was at Cannes for the premiere of her most recent film, Only God Forgives. The film, which also stars Ryan Gosling, tells the story of a drug smuggler in Bangkok whose brother is murdered. Miss Scott Thomas, who has never remarried after divorcing her husband of 17 years, French obstetrician François Olivennes, in 2008, plays Crystal, the drug smuggler’s foul-mouthed mother. She joked that she will probably be single for life because ‘all the men will run for the hills’ when they see it. The actress told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘It’s incredibly difficult keeping relationships alive when you have a lifestyle like mine. I’m never more than a few weeks in one place.’ Miss Scott Thomas, whose children are Hannah, 24, Joseph, 21 and George, 13, admitted that her personal life often suffers because of her career. She said she uses work as ‘an escapism thing’ when things get difficult at home and is enjoying the fact that her children can look after themselves. She said: ‘If I’ve signed on to do something, then I have to do it properly. So I have to switch off the personal life. I can just about squeeze in a phone call at lunchtime, but anything else I just can’t deal with. ‘So it’s a bit of an escapism thing, actually. Things complicated at home? Get a job!

"Spared jail: Linsey Attridge, pictured, falsely accused two men of raping her and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service . A woman who falsely accused two strangers of raping her in a bid to win back her boyfriend has escaped jail. In an attempt to garner sympathy from her partner, Linsey Attridge, 31, claimed the two men broke into her house in Aberdeen and attacked her. She even punched herself in the face and ripped her own clothing to make her story seem more credible. Attridge then spent three days . trawling social networking sites so she could hand over profiles of the . men she claimed were responsible to police. The two men were detained, questioned and had to undergo forensic and medical examinations because of her claims. It was two months before police dropped the case against them because there was no evidence to support the allegations. Attridge appeared in Aberdeen Sheriff Court on Wednesday, where she admitted wasting police time. Yesterday, . her former partner Nick Smith, 32, said she had put the lives of the . two random men she pinpointed as rapists through hell. Mr Smith said he had also suffered difficulties because he chose to support her. He added: ‘I’ve spent the last two . years trying to build bridges with my parents, my sister and some of my . friends – just because of everything that happened. ‘I also feel sorry for the two guys on Facebook. I don’t know who they are, she just picked them off Facebook. ‘They didn’t deserve that, no one deserves that. These poor guys were tormented. They won’t get any compensation for this.’ Attridge had been in a relationship with Mr Smith for 18 months at the time of the incident in 2011. But their romance had hit the rocks and the  couple looked likely to split. Duped: Nick Smith, pictured, spent weeks comforting his partner Linsey Attridge after she told him that she was attacked and raped by strangers in their home while he was out . She thought, however, that  she could save their relationship by making up a story claiming to have been raped. Mr . Smith spent weeks comforting her after she told him she was attacked . and raped by the strangers in their home while he was playing football. The . court heard single mother Attridge, now of Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, . had made up the story so Mr Smith would be more caring towards her. But . after she was sentenced to 200 hours of unpaid work in the community . rather than jail, Mr Smith said: ‘I think  the sentence was ridiculous. I . actually walked out of the court as soon as I heard it. I think the . justice system has let us all down.’ The . kickboxing instructor from Aberdeen said the worst part of the whole . experience had been listening to her lies come out in court. He added: ‘Sitting in court and hearing that was hard to take. But I’m glad it’s done and dusted and I can move on. ‘It’s been really quite bad, as while we were together I lost touch with family and friends. ‘She started arguments with friends. I think it was because they had figured her out.’ Mr Smith said her sentence was not enough, as she could have potentially ruined lives with her lies. He added: ‘She doesn’t think about anyone else or the consequences of her actions. She should have been locked up.’ Attridge has 12 months to complete her community  payback order. She was also placed under the supervision of the social work department for two years. Police refused to comment on the case yesterday. Two years ago, a lawyer accused the Scottish justice system of taking a ‘softly, softly’ approach to rape investigations which allows women to make false allegations. Iain Innes represented Charlene Kielty, 23, who was jailed for 18 months for lying about a sex ordeal. Despite acting for Kielty, Mr Innes took the unusual step of criticising police and prosecutors for failing to crack down on false rape allegations.","Linsey Attridge concocted the story to gain sympathy from her boyfriend .

The . couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which . wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister. Accused: Timothy Walker allegedly shot Sgt. Derek Johnson dead before turning the gun on his girlfriend and himself . Detectives . are now waiting at Intermountain Medical Center, where the couple are . being treated to question them about the shooting. They have a daughter together who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother. Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction. 'She would cry, ‘I never pictured my life turning out like this,’' King told the newspaper. According to King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'. She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car. She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' King added in the interview. 'I just want them to know I’m sorry'. Walker has a history of petty crime but nothing that would indicate the murder he is accused of carrying out on Sunday. Vaillancourt too has a record of theft and shoplifting but nothing violent. Sgt Johnson, 32, a father-of-one will be buried on Friday. Killed: Father-of-one Sgt Derek Johnson was killed when he stopped alongside Walker's Volvo . Crashed: Sgt Johnson drove his car a short distance after being shot, crashing it into a field . Shot dead: A tribute site has been set up to Derek Johnson . Proud dad: Derek Johnson is pictured with his son Bensen . 'The streets of Draper City were made . safer by Sgt. Derek Johnson who loved his job as a police officer for . the Draper City Police Department,' Johnson's family wrote in his . obituary. 'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept. 1, 2013, at the age of 32.' He was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a 6-year-old son Bensen. 'He . was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, . Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer . of the Year. With a good nature, a sense of humor that could light up . any room, attention to detail and the ability to make anyone his friend. He made a difference. He loved his family, hunting, running, hiking and . giving service. He was always up for a good challenge,' it reads. The police officer, promoted last year, tried to drive away after the shooting and crashed his patrol car into a field. The owner, Dan Smith, hung ribbons in his memory. 'There's . no words that can explain it and make it ok,' Smith said. 'It obviously . tugs at your heartstrings and you want to do something to show that it . wasn't in vain.'

"As the home of the Royal Family for almost a thousand years Windsor Castle has become a symbol of peace and harmony. But now the tranquility of the Queen's Berkshire home is set to be shattered by sound of an extra 1,700 night flights which will give royal residents a rude awakening from four o'clock in the morning. Plans drawn up by the Department of . Transport could see hundreds of night flights diverted away from the . homes of 110,000 residents of the west London. Queen's home: There could be an extra 1,700 night flights over Windsor Castle which will begin at 4am . But the price of quieter nights in Richmond, Kew and Hounslow will be more noise for the 15,000 people living in the Windsor area, including the Queen. Disruption: The planes flying overhead are a 'private matter' for the Queen . And considering 90 per cent of arrivals land between 4.30am and 6.00am the plans look set to disrupt the Queen's peace. Windsor MP Adam Afriyie, has called on residents to resist. The Conservative MP told the Sunday Times: 'I am particularly concerned by this latest proposal, which could have a truly detrimental impact on the quality of life of Windsor residents, and I would urge residents to make their views known.' The Queen spends most of her private weekends at Windsor Castle as well as taking up official residence there for a month over Easter. She also spends a week there in June, when she attends Royal Ascot and the service of the Order of the Garter. But a Royal spokesman told the Daily Mail the issue of night-time disruption at Windsor Castle was a 'private matter for the Queen'. The Department of Transport (DfT) hopes to divert 1,670 flights away from approaching over London and passing over Windsor Castle instead. Under existing rules Heathrow is allowed 5,256 incoming scheduled night flights a year. There are also a small number of unscheduled departures which means Londoners have to put up with nearly 16 planes passing overhead every night. The majority of incoming night flights - 72 per cent - approach Heathrow over the built-up boroughs of west London, with the remaining 28 per cent passing the Windsor area. Night flights: More planes used by British Airways and other airlines will  fly over Windsor under the proposals . But the (DfT) is now considering ordering pilots to approach from the west thereby avoiding the more heavily populated area, unless a tailwind of five knots or more makes this impractical. This would increase the flights passing over Windsor from about 1,470 to about 3,150 every year. The potential winners of this strategy are the 245,000 Londoners who claim they are affected by the noise. John Stewart, chairman of the Hacan Clear-Skies group, which campaigns against aircraft noise, yesterday told the Daily Mail: 'Many people in west London will clearly benefit if this change went ahead but it would be at the expense of many more sleepless nights for the people of Windsor.' A (DfT) spokeswoman told the Daily Mail diverting the approach path for night flights was 'just one option' being examined. She said: 'The government recognises that noise disturbance from aircraft flying at night is the least acceptable impact of airport operation on local residents. 'At this stage we are gathering evidence on what might be feasible and have taken no decisions yet on our preferences. We will be consulting on specific proposals later this year once we have assessed the evidence received from this consultation.'","Rude royal awakening from four o'clock in the morning as 110,000 sleepless residents in west London may see flights diverted over Berkshire .

"A mysterious Tourette's-like illness, which appears to be spreading uncontrollably among teenage girls at a New York high school, has left doctors totally baffled. So far 14 girls and one boy at Le Roy High School in New York have shown symptoms including facial tics, sores, involuntary twitching and uncontrollable verbal outbursts. At first the bizarre outbreak was put down to mass-hysteria - a peculiar stress related condition which has been known to occasionally affect groups of girls. Mystery: 15 students at New York High School, many of them cheerleaders, . have spontaneously begun showing signs of a Tourette's-like illness . Frustrated: Katie Krautwurst, 16, (left)  and Thera Sanchez, 17, (right) are among 15 girls  at LeRoy Junior-Senior High School in upstate New York suffering sudden uncontrollable outbursts and tics . The school then brought in brain specialist Dr Jennifer McVige who diagnosed an illness called conversion disorder which can cause symptoms similar to those caused by Tourette's such as partial loss of muscle function, paralysis and speech problems. Now leading environmental activist Erin Brockovich has been called in to investigate suggestions the youngsters may have been poisoned by a chemical spill. Some parents have reported sightings of an orange substance oozing up through the soil onto the school playing fields. On the case: Campaigning lawyer and environmental activist Erin Brockovich is investigating reports of an orange substance oozing onto the school playing fields . Brockovich, 51, famously played by Julia Roberts in the 2000 movie, believes the mysterious ooze may be the result of a chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the school. According to a 1999 report by the . U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, almost one tonne of cyanide . crystals spilled to the ground in the derailment, along with 130,000 . litres of trichloroethene. The crystals were removed but the trichloroethene was absorbed into the ground. In 1996, Brokovich fought and won a mass lawsuit for an estimated $333 million dollars against Pacific Gas and Electric, who allegedly contaminated drinking water in the town of Hinkley, California. She claims to have received more . than one hundred emails about the school and has now sent a team of . scientists to collect soil samples. She . said: 'There are reports from parents that at the atheletic field where . all the children have been there is an orange yellow substance oozing . up from the ground. 'When . I read reports like this that the New York Department of Health and . state agencies were well-aware of the spill and you don’t do water . testing or vapor extraction tests, you don’t have an all-clear. 'We don’t have all the answers, but we . are suspicious. They have not ruled everything out yet. The community . asked us to help, and this is what we do.' One victim 17-year-old Chelsey Dumars, . described how she can't stop her arm swinging across her face and . suffers uncontrollable face twitches. She said: 'I started twitching constantly. Sometimes it gets me to the point I want to cry from twitching so much. 'I don't like even going into stores any more  because I feel like people are staring at me. Unexplained: The teenagers, mostly girls, have developed tics and seizures. The majority of sufferers attend Le Roy High School . Another victim 16-year-old Traci Leunbar added: 'A lot of people say we are faking it . 'I'd like to see anyone do what we do 24 hours a day and try to fake that. If I could stop I would. I would love to.' School administrators would not disclose exactly what they think has caused the outbreak but insist it is not a case of mass hysteria and that none of the girls are making the illness or symptoms up. Earlier this month, the school held a forum for concerned parents. About 150 people attended, demanding to know what was wrong with the students. Expert: Dr Greg Young, with the NYS Department of Health, said he is unable to disclose what the cause of the symptoms are due to privacy laws . Dr . Greg Young, with the NYS Department of Health, said: 'I can assure you . these children have all been seen by professionals that have come up . with answers and they are all being treated and they're actually doing . pretty well.' Dr Young revealed . that tics like this can be caused by a number of factors such as . genetics, head trauma, drugs for ADHD and OCD and antihistamines. Through . tests over the last few months, they have been able to rule out a . number of environmental factors, infections, illegal drugs and carbon . monoxide poisoning. But Brockovitch believes New York . officials might have prematurely ruled out environmental reasons for the . teens having neurological symptoms. According to WGRZ.com, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta . has been consulted, along with Columbia University, as well as the . Genesee County Health Department and the New York State Health . Department. Dr Young assured parents that these cases have been seen nationwide and they come and go in individuals. Tourette's . syndrome affects the body's brain and nervous system by causing tics - . repeated, uncontrollable movements or involuntary vocal sounds. Strangely two other girls who attend a . school in Corinth, Saratoga County, around 250 miles away, have reported . the same symptoms.","15 students at New York school now showing symptoms including facial tics and involuntary twitching .

"The married New York mother who was murdered while on a solo trip to Turkey had sex the day before she vanished with a man she met on the internet, he has claimed. 'Taylan K' has been interviewed at length by Istanbul police after they discovered his online communication with 33-year-old Sarai Sierra, but he had initially insisted they were just friends. Now Turkey's Vatan newspaper has claimed Taylan told police they had consensual sex a day before Sierra went missing. The duo had met online months before Sierra left for Turkey on January 7. It adds yet more intrigue to the circumstances surrounding Sierra's death after earlier reports she was hanging out with 'a criminal element' before she was killed. The FBI is also reportedly investigating whether she was involved in drug trafficking during her visit to the country. Murdered: . The body of amateur photographer Sarai Sierra was found in Istanbul on . Saturday; a man she met on the internet has now claimed they had consensual sex the day before . Tryst: She reportedly met the man, identified as 'Taylan', when he commented on her Instagram page . Taylan, who first met Sierra online . several months ago when he commented on one of her photographs on . Instagram, denied having any part in her disappearance or murder. He added that he sent her a message on the day she vanished and asked her to meet, but she never responded. Police have taken a blood and sperm sample from Taylan and 21 others. Claims: Turkey's Vatan newspaper reported that Taylan had sex with the married mother of two . Sierra's body was . found stashed by Istanbul's ancient city walls on Saturday, more than a . week after she failed to catch her flight home. Police said she died . from a blunt force trauma. She was found with a head wound and a blanket near her body. She was . wearing jeans, a jumper and a jacket, and still had her earrings and a . bracelet on, but her iPhone and iPad were missing. The claims come on the same day as a source familiar with her murder investigation has suggested she had been hanging out with 'a criminal element' while on the trip. FBI agents investigating the killing . do not believe she had only travelled to the country to take pictures, . as her family has claimed. 'The first people she met up with were a criminal element,' the source told the New York Post. 'There are some . witness reports that she was seen with sketchy characters.' Authorities are now trying to verify . these claims amid reports that her casket will be sent back to the . United States on Thursday, the Post reported. Among various lines of inquiry investigators are looking into a possible connection to drug trafficking. Sierra, who had been unemployed and . had declared bankruptcy in 2005, had also travelled to Amsterdam and . Munich while on the trip, which was her first time leaving the United . States. She had . initially planned to visit the country for three weeks, but after 12 . days she posted online that she had to cut the trip short. Heading home: Sierra's casket is seen inside the Surp Yerrortutyun church in Istanbul, Turkey on Wednesday. Her body is expected to be sent back to the U.S. on Thursday .

To pay for her funeral, her family began selling some of her images online on Tuesday and soon had enough to cover her expenses. The photos remain on sale online and any other profits will go to her two young sons, who are nine and 11, her family wrote on the website. Photographs on sale include images taken during her time in Istanbul and pictures of New York City. They are being sold as canvases, framed prints, greeting cards and iPhone cases for $39.95 each. 'Sarai's passion for photography and love for capturing the beauty we see in culture, architecture and scenery was her reason for traveling to Istanbul,' her brother, David Jimenez, wrote on the site. Scene: Her body was found stashed in this cave in the low-income district of Sarayburnu on Saturday . Theory: Police say she may have been murdered somewhere else and her body was dragged to the area . Violent: Her autopsy found she died of a blunt force trauma to the head; some belongings were missing . He added this afternoon: 'Thank you . for all the support in purchasing Sarai's pictures. Quick update, all . expenses for Sarai's funeral have been paid for! 'From . here on out any picture of hers that you purchase will NOT be going . towards her funeral. All funds will be going to her children. Thank you . for your support. David.' The outpouring of support comes hours . after Sierra's devastated husband, Steven, revealed how he is consumed . with sadness at his wife's death. Mr Sierra, 40, left their home in .

"Archaeologists have discovered an 'epic' new fossil site they could change what we know about animal evolution. The secret site is revealing fossils at an 'astonishing' rate, researchers say. They claim it will significantly increase our understanding of animals in the Cambrian period. Scroll down for video . Jean-Bernard Caron with some of the fossil finds at the new site, which could hold more species than anywhere else in the world . Yoho National Park's 505-million-year-old Burgess Shale – home to some of the planet's earliest animals, including a very primitive human relative – is one of the world's most important fossil sites. This new finding is the latest in a recent string of Burgess Shale discoveries, including confirmation that Pikaia, found only in Yoho National Park, is the most primitive known vertebrate and therefore the ancestor of all descendant vertebrates, including humans. Now, more than a century after its discovery, a compelling sequel has been unearthed: 42 kilometres away in Kootenay National Park, a new Burgess Shale fossil site has been located that appears to equal the importance of the original discovery, and may one day even surpass it. Approximately 200 animal species had been identified at the original Yoho site in over 600 field days. In just 15 days of field collecting, 50 animal species have already been unearthed at the new site. The site, discovered in the summer of 2012 by an international research team led by University of Toronto ecology and evolutionary biologist Jean-Bernard Caron, is described in a paper released today in Nature Communications. 'This is an epic new chapter in a research story that began more than 100 years ago and there is no doubt in my mind that this new material will significantly increase our understanding of early animal evolution,' said Caron. 'The rate at which we are finding animals — many of which are new — is astonishing, and there is a significant possibility that we’ll eventually find more species here than at the original Yoho site, and potentially more than from anywhere else in the world.' Protected by Parks Canada, the exact location of the new site remains confidential to protect its integrity - though future visitor opportunities have not been ruled out. Researchers say they are finding fossils at an 'astonishing' rate . The remote location is being kept secret to avoid fossil hunters descending on it . 'We were already aware of the presence of some Burgess Shale fossils in Kootenay National Park,' said research team member Robert Gaines of Pomona College. 'We had a hunch that if we followed the formation along the mountain topography into new areas with the right rock types, maybe, just maybe, we would get lucky – though we never in our wildest dreams thought we’d track down a motherlode like this. 'It didn’t take us very long at all to realize that we had dug up something special. A panoramic image of the area . 'To me, the Burgess Shale is a grand tale in every way imaginable, and we are incredibly proud to be part of this new chapter and to keep the story alive and thriving in everyone’s imagination.' Some species found at the new Kootenay site are also found in China's famous Chengjiang fossil beds, which are 10 million years older. This contributes to the pool of evidence suggesting that the local and worldwide distribution of Cambrian animals, as well as their longevity, might have been underestimated. some of the fossil finds - in just 15 days of field collecting, 50 animal species have already been unearthed at the new site. The team is set to return to the area soon to continue their hunt . 'We know that we have barely scratched the site and nonetheless found at least 12 new species to describe,' said Cédric Aria, a PhD student in U of T's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. 'What awaits us there, only the mountain knows, but chances are high that the discoveries will fuel a lot more research. 'The full potential of these new fossil beds has yet to be revealed.' Approximately 200 animal species had been identified at the original Yoho site in over 600 field days. In just 15 days of field collecting, 50 animal species have already been unearthed at the new Kootenay site. The Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid appearance, around 530million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as demonstrated in the fossil record. Before about 580million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. It ended with the Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488million years ago. A paper published today in the prestigious scientific journal Nature Communications describes Kootenay National Park's new 'Marble Canyon' fossil beds for the first time. The authors suggest that the area and its extraordinary fossils will greatly further our understanding of the sudden explosion of animal life during the Cambrian Period.

"A high-flying German businesswoman lost £625,000 after she had an affair with a former security guard who posed as a wealthy investor, a court heard yesterday. Company chief executive Talke Stauss, 46, claimed she was so in love with Rizwan Butt she believed his story that he was the go-between for a potential $1.5 billion dollar investment into her hedge fund. In fact, the 45-year-old ran a cleaning company with minimal assets and lived with his mother in a £56,000 terraced house in Longsight, Manchester. Charm: Talke Stauss, left, said she was duped by security guard Rizwan Butt, right, into paying a $1m deposit for a bogus investment. The court heard the bachelor, 45, rented a Bentley and actually lived with his mother . Modest: The home in Longsight, Manchester, where Rizwan Butt lived with his mother while posing as a billion-dollar investment adviser and renting a Bentley to visit top London hotels like the Ritz . When he asked for a million dollars as a . returnable “security deposit’ to clinch the $1.5 billion deal, Mrs Stauss and her . husband Roman, 44, agreed to transfer the money in sterling to Butt’s . bank account without carrying out any checks on his background, a jury . was told. Mrs Stauss alleges she was taken in by . his 'charm offensive', which included meetings at top London hotels, . and talk of introducing investors from the Middle East and of having a . Swiss bank account. He rented a Bentley to visit the Dorchester and Ritz hotels and drove her back to her apartment in it, and later professed his love for her. She told the jury she was so enamoured with Butt that she was planning on leaving her husband but only stopped when a director of her investment firm confronted her, insisting Butt was a fraud - but by then she had already paid the £650,000 deposit. Appearing with her husband Roman yesterday at Manchester Crown Court, she said: 'He said he fell in love with me. I was then charmed and fell in love with him. 'There . was business... and I was dragged into falling in love with him . and we were having a love affair. There is a personal relationship and a . sexual relationship. There is a difference and it develops slowly. There are different stages of love. 'The . nature of the relationship was too deep for comfort. I was under . additional pressure when he confessed his love. I reciprocated and . regret that very much. Trial: Mr and Mrs Stauss, who were conned out of £625,000, hid their faces as they left court . 'He indicated I was a prized possession and would bring success for . the company. I gave in to the pressure. It was supposed to be an . in-and-out payment and would come back to us in two banking days.' Butt . claimed he had contacts with Middle Eastern investors . during the two-month scam, which he ran from his mother's £56,000 . terraced house in Longsight, Manchester, the jury heard. Mrs . Stauss, her husband Roman, 44, and a fellow investor, Eddie George, were aiming to form a hedge fund after setting up a financial firm called ATG in April 2012. Roman Stauss, 44, said he knew paying a cash deposit was unusual but he agreed because Butt was from the Middle East . They . were introduced to Butt though a German friend who met him at a . renewable energy fair, where he said he was interested in investing his money. They had three meetings at London's Dorchester Hotel in the space of three weeks in August last year, and from one he drove Mrs Stauss home in a Bentley. At the third meeting, on August 17, Butt reportedly said he wanted to introduce investors . from Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia who had $1.5billion to put into in the . couples' hedge fund. They were then asked to pay a $1m . security despot to Butt to 'demonstrate the legitimacy and viability' of their firm, ATG. Butt met Mrs Stauss again on September 7 in the Maroush Lebanese restaurant in Knightsbridge, London. By this time he had professed his love for her and promised to pay back the money as soon as he had shown it to his . investors. Without carrying out any background checks, Mrs Stauss and her husband transferred the funds to Butt’s company Horizon Solutions UK, the court heard. The alarm was raised when a worried Mr George researched Butt and discovered the firm had net assets of just £657. Mrs . Stauss returned from a business . trip with Butt in Shanghai with a plan to leave her . husband - and was confronted by Mr George. She asked for the money back and Butt, who had left Shanghai early, . sent a text message saying: 'Talke my dear. No problem my love. They . should have it by five this evening. Take care love. Kisses.' Another text read: 'good morning my dear hope you’re . well. The funds should be in your account by now as they’re out of . mine.' One said: 'tell him not to worry. He will have the funds. B . patience.' Rizwan Butt, left, said he had not conned Talke Stauss, right, and the deal fell through because her investment firm did not have a relevant trading licence. Prosecutors say he committed fraud through a 'charm offensive' Fraud: The black Mercedes in which Rizwan Butt, 45, arrived at Manchester Crown Court . Police caught up with Butt four weeks later, the court heard, and found him at the wheel of a . black Audi Q7 carrying £1,000 in cash. He had bought a . house for £175,000 and had a black Mercedes parked on the driveway. The Bentley turned out to be rented - and before the scam he drove a 2003 Honda Accord, the court heard.

Mr Stauss told the court: 'We were aware for Western Europe business [paying a cash deposit] was uncommon, but for Middle Eastern business they do it this way. 'But we decided that although it was not 100% clear cut, given the email conversations we would go ahead. 'This was the first time her business decision and my business decision were not correct because we were involved with someone who played a very clever game.'

Paul Dockery, prosecuting, said: 'The . Stauss’ were impressed by the defendant’s knowledge of investments, . global economics and wealth fund opportunities in the Middle East. Mr . Butt said he wanted to make a significant investment in the hedge fund. 'But . he was dishonest from the outset and created an image about himself as . being wealthy knowledgeable and practised investor with genuine . investment connections. 'The reality was that he was presenting a false existence in an endeavour to make financial gain whenever he could. 'Talke . Stauss particularly was deluded and so keen to gain wealthy investors . for her hedge fund that she did not make the most basic check on the . defendant’s background. 'By reason of the image the defendant had presented to Mr and Mrs Stauss . they did not question the justification for the transfer or require any . checks to be done into Mr Butt or his company.

'He . also on that occasion told Mrs Stauss he had fallen in love with her . and he had begun to charm her.

The jury was shown e-mails between Butt and Mrs Stauss, including one from him which said: 'They don’t know what security deposit I am taking off you so you need to sort this out quick so I can give them the feedback.'

"Not guilty: Reg Traviss pictured outside Southwark Crown Court after being cleared of rape on Thursday . Amy Winehouse's former boyfriend today spoke out about the nine-month ordeal he suffered after being accused of raping a woman while she slept in his bed. Reg Traviss described his rape trial as being like a 'runaway train' as he celebrated walking free from Southwark Crown Court when a jury acquitted him of all charges. A 27-year-old friend of his had accused him of twice raping her at his flat in Marylebone, central London, in the early hours of New Year's Eve last year. The 35-year-old film director - who was going out with Back To Black singer Winehouse when she died in July last year - said the pair had consensual sex after a night out drinking together. The unnamed woman denied that she had consented, and accused Traviss of saying, 'I've always wanted to do this to you' as he sexually assaulted her. Hearing the verdicts, Traviss closed his eyes and bowed his head. Emerging from the dock, he thanked Judge Deborah Taylor and hugged his family and friends. Leaving . court he hit out at the authorities for not dropping the weak prosecution case, and said he hoped to fall in love again after . losing Winehouse, thanking his current girlfriend, actress Sheridan Smith, for supporting him during the trial. He said the 'nauseating' trauma of the false allegations had compounded the grief he felt in the wake of the singer's death: 'It has been a difficult 18 months, it's been unreal in the true sense of the term.' Speaking on the steps outside Southwark Crown Court, Traviss said the police should have dropped the investigation after looking at CCTV that contradicted her version of events. She told investigators she was so drunk she could not stand up, but footage showed her walking freely and unaided with Mr Traviss to get in a taxi to his flat. He said: 'I am really relieved, really relieved it's all over. I never did it. The last nine months or however long has been crazy. 'It feels like anyone can make a complaint and end up having their day in court. Being impartial, that's fair enough and I think it is right. 'I can understand why it's like that but in reality a train starts running and in this case the person who made the complaint wasn't investigated, the police didn't know anything about her.' Lovers: The film director was dating Amy Winehouse at the time of her death last year . New girlfriend: Reg Traviss paid tribute to actress Sheridan Smith, pictured hugging him above, for standing by him during the trial . He added that he had always been confident that the police, Crown Prosecution Service and judge did not believe he was guilty. Calling . for anonymity for those accused of sex crimes, he said: 'I definitely . think in cases like this, no one believed it but my name was still . associated with those headlines. 'That's going to be the case unless anonymity is given to the accused in cases like this.' Traviss branded his accuser 'either mentally ill or evil' and said he had not seen her since the night they had sex. His . lawyer, Ian Winter QC, said: 'It is an exceptional case and I don't . think in my career that I have defended a case where I have been so sure . of my client's innocence. 'What . is unbelievable is that if we hadn't found them coming out of the club . on that CCTV, which the police had totally failed to identify, there was . a real risk of a miscarriage of justice.' Denial: Reg Traviss, pictured left, has always denied the rape allegation. After the verdict he said of new love Sheridan Smith, right, that 'she has been a real strength throughout' The director, . who made the 2010 film Psychosis, featuring Buffy the Vampire Slayer . star Charisma Carpenter and The Darkness singer Justin Hawkins, was . first arrested over the allegations in April. Traviss, who . had apparently planned to marry Winehouse before she tragically died, . said he was 'completely and utterly flabbergasted' by the claims and there was 'no question' the attack happened. He even told the jury: 'I sort of . came away from that evening thinking this could be really good, this . could be the start of something. 'I wasn't looking for a girlfriend, but she is somebody I have known for a long time and that there could be something in this.' Southwark Crown . Court had earlier heard how the pair had been out drinking in three West . End bars when they headed back to his flat in the early hours. Free: Traviss was said to be in mourning for Winehouse at the time of his encounter with the woman . Tributes: Traviss standing outside Winehouse's home shortly after her death last July . The . woman claimed she was asleep in bed with Mr Traviss when she awoke to . find him having sex with her. She said he stopped when she asked him . what he was doing, but when she passed out again she woke up to him . doing it a second time. The 27-year-old also claimed that . when she later got up to leave his home she could not find her . underwear. When she asked Traviss where they were he told her he wanted . to keep them as a memento, she claimed. But . Traviss has always strongly maintained his innocence and told the court . the woman was completely 'compos mentis' when they had sex, and that it . was in fact her who lured him into bed. He . said they had both been 'merry drunk' and had agreed she would stay at . his as it was just round the corner which she was 'very happy to do so.' At . around 4.30am Traviss said he suggested they 'get their heads down' and . offered to sleep on the sofa while she slept in the bed but she told . him to 'come and sleep in the bed' and initiated sex. He told the court: 'She had a big smile on her face. She was being very inviting about me coming and getting into bed with her. 'She was someone that I knew and trusted. If she didn't then I would just go to sleep. But pretty much straight away we started kissing and touching each other. 'She was leading it just as much as I was following it. It was completely equal. There was never any question she did not consent. 'There is no truth in whatsoever in the allegations. It didn't happen.'","Woman claimed Reg Traviss attacked her after they had been drinking .

"Channel 4 was under increased pressure last night to explain why it broadcast a quiz featuring obscene jokes about the Queen just minutes after the 9pm watershed. The Daily Mail told yesterday how viewers were outraged by the antics of drunken comedians on the Big Fat Quiz of 2012, presented by controversial comic Jimmy Carr on Sunday. TV watchdog Ofcom has already received complaints about the pre-recorded show and the countless vile sexual jokes told by stand-up star Jack Whitehall and actor James Corden. Scroll down for video . No comment: Channel 4 bosses refused to break their silence over the furore surrounding Big Fat Quiz Of The Year 2012. Featured guests included  Richard Ayoade, Russell Howard, Jonathan Ross, Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall,  James Cordon and Gabby Logan . Anger: Comedian Jack Whitehall and actor James Corden were behind many of the offensive remarks on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz of the year 2012 . They included puerile remarks about the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, Barack Obama, Usain Bolt and Susan Boyle. Lord Burns, the chairman of Channel 4, last night refused to comment on the broadcast. Britain's most successful comedian, Billy Connolly, has stuck the knife into Channel 4, as they face huge criticism over their Big Fat Quiz of 2012. Speaking before the show was broadcast, The Big Yin, 70, accused modern 'gurning' comics of killing stand-up because 'Channel 4-type' comedians prefer to grab TV chat show spots instead of working on new material. Connolly, who was voted most influential stand-up ever in a poll last year, fumed: 'When I see all these London guys who all hang out together at the Groucho and all that, I'm really glad I'm not one of them. 'They call jokes ""gags"". I don't talk like that. 'I don't want to be like them, Channel 4-type comedy people. 'They have this drive and I'm glad I don't have it. 'Like, you must be seen at Edinburgh until you're 99. 'Look at him, isn't he great!' No, he's not great. 'I listen to them on the radio at the Edinburgh festival, but I wouldn't darken its door. 'I think stand-up comedy is in danger. 'Stand-ups spend their time gurning on panel shows in the hope of one day being given a chat show.' After the Mail attempted to speak to . him at his home and over the telephone a member of the Channel 4 press . office told us he would not be commenting and asked us to stop . contacting him. David Abraham, the chief executive of Channel 4, was also unable to comment because he was on holiday in Vietnam, we were told. Now Tory MP Conor Burns, a member of . the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, is demanding to . know why the quiz was broadcast as early as 9pm. He said: ‘I actually watched some of . the broadcast because we are staying with family for the holidays and I . found it quite distasteful. 'I walked into the other room. Sadly this . sort of gauche, vulgar “anything goes humour” that appeals to the lowest . common denominator in society is becoming more common. ‘I just wonder, given everything that . has been going on in the media over the last six months, what has . happened to editorial judgment and reason. ‘It was base, unfunny comedy and in some ways I thought its greater crime really was that it just wasn’t funny. ‘In my role on the committee I will be . writing to Channel 4 and asking for its editorial  explanation for . broadcasting such unpleasant output so soon after the watershed.’ Former Gavin and Stacey star Corden, . 34, and Marlborough-educated Whitehall, 24, were seen to get drunk on . red wine  during the quiz which was shown between 9pm and 10.30pm. Their infantile behaviour was egged on . by Jonathan Ross, 52, who left the BBC after making an . abusive phone call to actor Andrew Sachs during a radio show. Channel 4 has been accused of failing . to learn the lessons from the Sachsgate scandal which was also . pre-recorded and cleared before broadcast on the Russell Brand radio . show. Criticism: MP Conor Burns, member of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he watched part of the programme and found it 'distasteful' Last night the Channel 4 quiz, which . attracted an audience of 2.5million, was coming under increased . criticism from viewers via the internet and social networking sites such . as Twitter. Cathie Green wrote: ‘No lessons learned from the Brand/Ross event which was on the same gutteral level ... ‘These idiot men are so grossly . arrogant, have no sense of respect for others, let alone the people whom . they have so sickeningly vilified.’ Patricia Martin wrote: ‘I usually like . that quiz but this year we turned over because I was sickened by them . being so rude about  the Queen and the really bad  language.’ Halfway through the broadcast Corden . could be seen pulling a bottle of red wine from under his desk and . pouring himself and Whitehall a drink while eating pizza. Carr later joked that the pair had drunk a bottle of wine each. After making a disgusting joke about . Susan Boyle, Corden appears to realise he has gone too far saying: ‘This . is where I do myself in and forget we’re recording this and it’s going . to be broadcast on TV. ‘I just think we are having a great time eating pizza.’ Peter Riley tweeted: ‘Big Fat Quiz Of . The Year, basically a reminder of what a sorry state Britain has become, . and what a disgraceful year 2012 has been.' Targets: The comics made crude jokes about gold medal sprinter Usain Bolt, left, and singer Susan Boyle, right . Bad taste: Comedian Jack Whitehall made rude . comments targeted at the Queen, left, and the recent illness of her . husband Prince Philip, right . One comedian who won't join in with the pack of 'competitive' comedians vying to deliver the best line is Rory Bremner. The impressionist slammed the BBC panelist show Mock the Week, which satirises news and current affairs, for being 'highly competitive and quite aggressive'. Mr Bremner, who has starred in the award-winning Bremner, Bird and Fortune sketch show, appeared as a panelist on the programme for two series following its 2005 launch. He compared some comedians, who regularly deliver controversial remarks, to 'prize fighters', the Daily Telegraph reported. The comedian refused to participate in the show, hosted by Dara O'Briain, and said that he had learned other comedians found the atmosphere too abrasive. In 2009 Jo Brand joined the chorus of discontent about the show, saying she left because of a lack of female panelists and the hostile nature of the show. She said at the time that she and other male comedians found that they had to 'bite someone's foot off before they let us say something' on the show. The BBC were unavailable to comment.","Programme featured countless vile sexual jokes broadcast just after 9pm .

"Sir David Nicholson has been forced to apologise to an NHS executive after posting a parody video portraying him as Hitler. Sir David tweeted the YouTube clip which mocked the new NHS data-sharing project headed by Tim Kelsey, and hit out at Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. The video, another internet parody on a scene from the movie Downfall, puts English subtitles to the German actors, attributing Hitler's 'words' to Mr Kelsey. Scroll down for video . NHS boss Sir David Nicholson has to apologise to another executive after posting a spoof video which portrayed him as Hitler . In the clip, Hitler, referred to as Mr Kelsey, the NHS national director for patients and information., gets told that the new care.data project is not going to plan. Sir David quickly removed the link to the YouTube clip, and apologised to Mr Kelsey, making sure he put a kiss on the end to make amends. ‘Sorry this is what happens when you give an old bloke with an over developed sense of humour new tech,’ he told M Kelsey. ‘You're doing a great job X’, he added. Date of birth, postcode, NHS number and gender are to be included in the new care.data record which was due to be introduced by NHS England in April. Spoof: English subtitles has been added to the famous climax scene from the German film Downfall about the last days of Hitler . In the video, instead of addressing Hitler, the German SS generals address 'Mr Kelsey' It has now been delayed until later this year after critics warned patients had been kept in the dark about how their data will be used outside the NHS. Titled ‘Tim Kelsey discovers that care.data is in trouble’, the video has had more than 3,000 hits since it was posted to YouTube earlier this week. In it, the subtitled words of the actor playing Hitler - identified as Mr Kelsey - state that the project has ‘always been about making money’. ‘Who cares about ordinary people, they never understand things,’ it shows him saying. ‘They don't have my vision for a better world’ Sir David acknowledged that it was wrong to link to a video which portrays another NHS executive as Adolf Hitler, and said sorry to Tim Kelsey . In the video, Mr Kelsey, speaking as Hitler, is mocking 'ordinary people' for protesting against the new data sharing project . The joke video also hits out at  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, accusing him of 'hiding behind a tree' over NHS's care.data project . It attacks ‘scaremongering’ data privacy campaigners and has him saying: ‘People didn't care when we sold off their NHS, they barely blinked’ At one point he is shown suggesting everything is OK because ‘Jeremy Hunt is right behind us’. But he is then told: ‘Jeremy Hunt is hiding behind a tree. The Government is saying nothing. They are all hiding behind trees.’ Responding . on the social media site, Mr Kelsey said: ‘My view on the YouTube film: . funny but we risk underestimating how important data-sharing is for the . NHS. Hitler was not a joke.’ A . spokesperson for NHS England said: ‘Sir David very much hopes his tweet . did not cause any offence, that was not his intention at all. Both the link to the video and Sir David's Twitter exchange with Mr Kelsey has been removed . ‘He knows his team is doing a really important and complex job for patients, one which is critical for the NHS.’ Sir David, who resisted a sustained and virulent campaign for him to resign or be sacked over the Mid Staffordshire scandal, is due to retire as chief executive of NHS England next month. Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne told the Evening Standard: ‘There can be no excuse for showing Jeremy Hunt and his top officials in such an offensive video.’ Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie added: ‘This is absolutely shocking. ‘He has done a very good job in portraying complete contempt not only for a co-worker but also the Secretary of State who has been so loyally defending him. ‘This is another reason why he should have gone a long time ago.’","Sir David Nicholson tweeted link to parody about NHS's new data project .

"Online dating is the best way for hopeful singletons to find love than in the modern world. But one controversial dating site has taken the selection process to a whole new level by allowing its users to filter out members looking for romance according to their body type ... for a price. Popular U.S. dating site, OkCupid.com lets online daters pay $4.95 (£3) to hide anyone who classes themselves 'curvy', 'skinny', 'thin', 'jacked' or 'used up' among other body types. Filter: OkCupid lets its users pay £3 a month to filter out people who class themselves as 'curvy' 'While it will probably be common knowledge to many internet dating aficionados, OkCupid’s premium search options are eyebrow-raising in an era of tolerance and political correctness,' writes Kermalmag.com journalist James Cook, who spotted the function. OkCupid also allows its 'A-list members' - who pay a monthly subscription fee of between $4.49 and $9.95 - to filter people by both looks and figure. Would YOU filter out people of certain body types and levels of attractiveness to find your perfect match online? One dating site lets you do just that . Select your type: A drop down menu allows users to filter matches by their body type, essentially allowing them to hide overweight people . You can select people in a drop-down menu who have body types such as 'thin', 'skinny', 'overweight and 'curvy'. You can also filter people based on their attractiveness rating, as ranked by other users. An anonymous OkCupid user added: 'I've been using OkCupid for just over a year now, and it's pretty disconcerting to think men have the ability to filter me out by my body type. 'However, the function is still placing a lot of trust in people's accurate description of themselves. I myself have been lucky that every guy I've met from the site has looked their pictures, but others I know have had some horrible surprises when they meet in person. A-listers: Premium users, who pay to upgrade their account, are allowed to filter out people based on their appearance rating, too . 'Equally the search for ""only five star"" rated people will not always yield supermodel results, as people, or at least myself, occasionally rate people on the quality of their profile and how they answer the site's questions, rather than purely their aesthetics. 'Beauty, after all, is supposed to be in the eye of the beholder. 'Ultimately, what freaks me out the most is the kind of person that would pay to exercise that degree of control over their results. To me, that suggests that the weird and wonderful world of online dating might not be for you.' Rowan Pelling added: 'OkCupid is clearly the Abercrombie & Fitch of dating sites, allowing curvy types to be screened out of supposed A-List members searches. 'All I can say is that you're pretty dumb and Z-list if you allow screening so prejudiced that some brainless body-fascist can screen out all plus-size suitors: goodbye Marilyn Monroe, Sophie Dahl, Lena Dunham, Gerard Depardieu, James Corden, Seth Rogen. 'And, you know what? I have a strong feeling that all of those people would be a hundred times better (and funnier) in bed than your average waif.

"For BlackBerry users, taking a leap of faith and ditching a QWERTY keyboard for a touchscreen phone can be daunting. To solve this, a company backed by US TV presenter Ryan Seacrest has attempted to bridge the gap by creating a physical keyboard that slides onto touchscreen phones - although it comes at a price. The Typo Keyboard costs $99 (£60) and is due to launch in January for iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S handsets. Other smartphones and tablet versions will then follow later next year. Scroll down for video . The Typo Keyboard, pictured, costs $99 (£60) and is due to launch in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas for the iPhone 5 and 5S.

When a user wants to write a message, . email or Facebook post, for example, they can type on the physical . keyboard and the key strokes will be sent wirelessly to the phone in . real-time. The case adds a quarter of an inch thickness to the bottom of the Apple handset, and around an inch to the length.

"They have tattoos, uniforms and the obligatory high-powered machines which mark them out as members of a biker gang. But these women are as likely to show off their brilliantly coloured talons as their tats and favour bikes festooned with flowers and painted an attractive shade of pink. In fact, the Bosozoku girls of Japan have rejuvenated a sub-culture that has been in rapid decline since the 1980s. Scroll down for video . Bad ass: Bosozuku girls of Japan are now taking part in the old sub culture that means 'violent run tribe' Bosozuku ('violent run tribe') consists of biker gangs which rebel against the strict rules of Japanese cultural in favour of a life on the road. Also known as the 'kaminari zoku' (thunder tribes) when it began in the 1950s, the group focuses on disrupting traffic in any way possible including running red lights, driving recklessly including speeding and traffic weaving, illegally modifying their bikes and ignoring noise restrictions. Members are traditionally characterised by their modified motorcycles which often include elements from American choppers and British café racer style bikes, as well as their elaborate costumes. Typically, traditional outfits resemble kamikaze or samurai style jumpsuits, with gang names, mottos and defining symbols and pictures embellished on the back. Otherwise, retro pilot boots, long overcoats and matching pants style which were a custom of the 70s Bosozoku fashion, derived from a combination of old kamikaze and  US Navy uniforms. The Bosozoku girls bring their own style to gang fashion, however. Not your typical bikie: Bosozoku girls still have tattoos, but their hair and nails are immaculate and polished, their bright bikes normally covered in stickers and multi-coloured . Gang culture: Bosozoku are notorious for wreaking road havoc and modifying their motorcycles to be more elaborate in style and louder than noise restrictions allow . Long, multi coloured, pointed nails, bright pink and red bikes adorned with stickers and painted pictures while still maintaining luscious long shiny hair, glossed lips and the typical tattoo. The women of these Japanese gangs say they are breaking away from gender stereotypes by challenging the domestic roles expected of women in modern Japan. In their own words, they are all about proving that 'Japanese women can wipe their own ass’. Many of the female members were introduced to the gang culture from ex partners before deciding they wanted to ride as well, the video explains. The gang’s activities are focused on road disruptions: running red lights, driving recklessly including speeding and traffic weaving, illegally modifying their bikes and ignoring noise restrictions, particularly when modifying their bikes. But they have also been linked to gang violence. Kannon Bodhisattva: One of the Japanese Bosozoku girls shows off her back piece tattoo of the goddess of mercy . The 15th generation: gang uniforms are passed down from rider to rider and can not be washed, according to gang law. Just wearing a uniform can get you arrested in Japan . The girls are also out to prove that the subculture is not a dying one, despite Japanese National Police Agency reports stating that the number of recognized Bosozoku members nationwide, hit a record low of 7,297 in 2012. This is down from the recorded 42,500 members at the subculture’s peak in 1982, according to the Japan Times. The reduction in member numbers is considered to be a result of a police crackdown and subsequent road traffic law revisions in 2004, which gave more power to police. Motorcycle gang members are so used to evading police, whom will target riders just for wearing a identifiable Bosozoku uniform, that members bikes are designed to help lose police cars in a chase. For this reason, handlebars are bent downward and inward in order to allow riders to weave between traffic, the video explains.

Miss Figueroa, from Lima, is five months pregnant with van der Sloot’s child and visits the jail twice a week bringing him home cooked meals. The pair plan to marry on May 22, having met in July 2010 when she went in to the same prison to visit a separate inmate who is said to have acted as a matchmaker. In an interview with Crimesider, Miss Figueroa, 24, said her husband-to-be had transformed himself ‘into a new person’ enjoying prison arts and crafts sessions.

Conjugal visits are allowed in Peruvian prisons if a couple are registered as common-law partners. Now it appears the couple are set to officially tie the knot in the next couple of days. Marrying a Peruvian could prove rather convenient for Van der Sloot as it would probably save him from extradition to the U.S. where he faces 25 years for extortion. The . Dutchman's extradition to the U.S. was approved last year in principle . by Peru's Supreme Court, but only after he serves out his sentence in . Lima. He could serve less than ten years in Peruvian prison for good . behavior. Joran van der Sloot, left, is set to marry his . pregnant fiancee Leidy Figueroa, right, on May 22 having asked his . lawyer to buy a ring with a 'small stone' Van der Sloot is reportedly taking part in prison arts and crafts sessions and is also studying international business management using a correspondence scheme with a Peruvian learning establishment . Now, . by marrying a local Peruvian, he can automatically apply for Peruvian . citizenship, which will hinder America’s chances of ever extraditing . him. In . 2010, he was charged with attempting to extort $250,000 from Natalee . Holloway’s mom in return for details about her daughter’s death. Van der Sloot took a $25,000 down payment and then traveled to Peru on May 14, 2010, a trip that ended with the murder of Miss Flores, whom he met in a Lima casino, on May 25. The date is a chilling one to the Holloway family, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen. Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot walks inside the courtroom during the reading of his verdict, in the Lurigancho prison in Lima, Peru on January 13, 2012. He was was sentenced to 28 years in prison for killing Stephany Flores in Lima in 2010 . He took . cash and credit cards from Miss Flores before fleeing to Chile, where he . was caught two days after her decaying body was found. He . confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after . she found out about his suspected involvement in the Natalee Holloway . case. Miss . Holloway's body has never been found and repeated searches in Aruba turned up . nothing as intense media coverage brought the case worldwide attention. Together . with a Dutch investigative journalist, Beth Holloway spoke to Van der . Sloot in a Peruvian jail where admit to extortion, but not to the truth . about what happened to her daughter. Natalee Holloway was 17 when she disappeared on Aruba, the Dutch island in the southern Caribbean Sea, during a school trip. Van der Sloot admitted to killing Flores, but blamed post traumatic stress disorder for being accused of Holloway’s disappearance for making him kill the Peruvian. In prison letters released last July, Van der Sloot said hoped the Flores family could forgive him for his crimes. 'I ask God every day that Stephany's parents can find it in their heart to forgive me,' he wrote.But he also made an attempt to paint himself as the victim. He said he believed he was misled by his attorney when he pleaded guilty to Flores’ murder and that he suffers from ‘psychological’ problems that should have been weighed in the murder case.Mr Van der Sloot wrote: 'My rights have been constantly abused. My lawyer promised me I would receive 15 years if I plead guilty, I did.' He also referred to himself as a psychological 'mess' in the letters, which were written in English and contain numerous misspellings and grammatical errors. 'I have a history of psychological problems which were never taken into consideration,' he said.","Leidy Figueroa confirms plans to marry Joran van der Sloot in Peruvian jail .

"Double director: Ex-chief constable Martin Baker runs two consultancy companies which stands to profit from the commissioner elections . A former chief constable could make thousands of pounds from the taxpayer as a result of this month’s police elections. Martin Baker suddenly resigned from his £141,000-a-year job as chief constable of Dorset Police, saying he felt ‘the time was right to hand over leadership’. But only five days after leaving the force, he became a director of two consultancy companies that offer services to the new police and crime commissioners. The candidates standing for the commissioner positions in 41 forces in England and Wales on November 15 are mainly made up of local politicians with little law enforcement experience. This has left an opportunity for former senior policemen to give them advice and administrative help when they are appointed, at a huge potential cost to the taxpayer. Mr Baker, 56, registered as a director of both One Team Policing and One Team Advisory on October 5. The name is similar to the motto he helped choose for Dorset Police: ‘One Team, One Vision.’ He officially finished his job with Dorset Police on September 30. Last year he received a bonus of £13,000, and he is entitled to a pension worth two thirds of his final salary or around £90,000 a year. The website for both companies state that its professionals provide specialist advice on ‘all aspects of law enforcement, criminal justice and community safety’. Mr Baker joined One Team Policing with two of his former colleagues from Dorset Police. It was set up by former assistant chief constable Mike Glanville and former chief superintendent Gill Donnell in March. Miss Donnell lives with Dorset Police’s director of human resources Graham Smith. Mr Baker and Mr Glanville are the only directors of One Team Advisory, which offers similar services. Under the banner ‘Voice of the people’, One Team Policing’s website states: ‘We are offering prospective candidates a range of free to use and paid services to support them in advance of the elections including a range of on-line campaign services. ‘We will also be able to provide a range of specialist services to elected commissioners once they take up office.’ Consultant: The website for consultancy firm One Team Policing where Martin Baker is a director alongside former colleague and ex-assistant chief constable at the Dorset Police, Mike Glanville . As it is a new company, the amount of money it has received has not yet been recorded publicly. But it has been reported that the company has offered commissioner candidates a ‘Standard Web Presence’ for £359 and a ‘Premium Web Presence’ for £1,799. Among the advice it offers are tips on ‘strategic leadership’, ‘cost reduction’ and ‘working with the media’. Police and crime commissioners will not run forces directly but will be responsible for appointing their chief constable, setting out local policing priorities, reporting annually on progress, and setting out the force budget. They will be paid between £65,000 to £100,000-a-year and candidates mainly include local politicians rather than the Government’s hope of former police chiefs. Patrick Mercer, chairman of the parliamentary sub-committee on counter-terrorism, said: ‘Unfortunately the money that the police authorities have to disperse will make these consultancy roles increasingly attractive to senior officers who are keen to retire and enter private business.’ Miss Donnell said: ‘We are delighted that Martin Baker has been able to join us at One Team Policing. His extensive experience in policing will be a real asset to our customers.’","Martin Baker, former chief constable of Dorset Police is a director in two companies consulting on crime and policing issues ."
"If an unmarried couple have sex they are considered husband and wife - and would have to ‘divorce’ if they split, an Indian court has ruled. When two people of legal age, 18 for a woman and 21 for a man, ‘indulge in sexual gratification’ this should be seen as a 'an act of total commitment' and marriage by law, a judge at Madras High Court said. The court said that the registering of a marriage as well as a wedding ceremony were only formalities to gain society’s approval. Just married? Any couple who have sex could to be considered husband and wife, an Indian court has ruled . It also said that once two people have sex this ‘becomes a total commitment with adherence to all consequences that may follow’, including needing a decree of divorce should they want to sleep with someone else. In addition, should either of the two wish to register the ‘marriage’ they can have their marital status declared by a Family Court as long as they can supply proof of a sexual relationship. Once declared by the court, the person can be established as the other’s spouse – whether the other party approves or not. ‘Legal rights applicable to normal wedded couples will also be applicable to couples who have had sexual relationships which are established,’ the court declared in their ruling obtained by The Hindu. No return: If a person can prove that he or she had sex with another, a Family Court will declare the marriage valid - whether the other person approves or not, according to the judge . House of law: The ruling came in a case of spousal maintenance at Madras High Court in India where a man was ruled to pay his former 'wife' as their children was proof of them living as a married couple . The verdict came in a spousal maintenance case where a lower court had ruled that a woman was not entitled to maintenance from the father of her two children as there was no proof of their marriage. Justice C.S. Karnan ruled that legal documents proving the couple’s life as spouses were more important than proof of marriage. In this case the man had signed the ‘live birth report’ for the couple’s second child and thereby officially declaring the woman as his wife. Judge Karnan said the couple ‘led their marital life under the same shelter and begot two children. 'Therefore, the petitioner’s rank has been elevated as the ""wife"" of the respondent and likewise, the respondent’s rank has been elevated as the ""husband"" of the petitioner.‘ . The man was ordered to pay the woman 500 rupees a month in maintenance as well as maintenance for their two children.","Any couple who have sex to be considered married, Madras High Court rules .

"It's the hottest, most consistently sunny summer many of us can remember, but dressing for hot weather continues to challenge us. One quirky brand has decided to embrace the little perils of summer dressing with a new eyebrow-raising fashion range. Japan-based retailer Village Vanguard has come . up with two new T-shirts which make the wearer appear to be committing snigger-inducing fashion faux pas.

In fact, it's designed to make the wearer appear to have pulled a plain white top over a wet dark navy swimsuit - thus causing the top to go soggy and see-through.

"A stroke patient lying paralysed in hospital listened in horror as doctors discussed organ donation with his family after telling them he would not survive. Jimi Fritze, 43, heard every word but couldn't protest because he was unable to speak. His heartbroken relatives had come to say their final goodbyes after doctors said brain scans showed he had 'no hope' of pulling through. As they surrounded his hospital bed, . doctors asked the family about the possibility of donating his organs . when he died, not realising Mr Fritze could also hear the conversation. Stroke victim Jimi Fritze listened helplessly as doctors discussed donating his organs with his family, but was unable to speak out. He later recovered and is now taking action against the hospital . He eventually recovered after his family sought advice from another medic. He has now launched an official complaint against the doctors for breaching rules by discussing organ donation before a patient is brain dead, it was reported by The Local. Mr Fritze suffered a brain haemorrhage while out with his family on the Gothenburg archipelago around two years ago. 'I managed to catch my girlfriend's attention - I was bright red in the face, and she's a nurse so she managed to keep my airways open,' Mr Fritze said. An air ambulance was unable to land on the island, so he had to wait nearly two hours to reach Sahlgrenska hospital by boat. Returning: Mr Fritze is now undergoing rehabilitation at Örebro hospital to regain full function in his limbs . Mr Fritze said: 'Only my ears and eyes were working. They (the doctors) told my girlfriend that there was no hope'. But three days later another doctor who had returned from holiday gave more positive prognosis. Mr Fritze said: 'She looked at my scans and said ""This doesn't look too bad"" and told the staff to give me cortisone to bring down the swelling in my brain.' It took another three weeks before he could communicate his horror to his family and more than two years on he has only just recovered enough to take action against the hospital. He has sent an official complaint to the health and welfare board, which oversees quality of healthcare in Sweden. Mr Fritze was taken to Sahlgrenska Hospital in Gothenburg where doctors told his family he could not be saved . 'If that doctor hadn't come back from her holiday, would I have been made to lie there until my body couldn't take it any longer?' Fritze asked in his complaint. A stroke is a serious medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off either from a blockage or a bleed. They affect different areas of the brain, so it is common for patients to lose some faculties while retaining others. 'As always, we are cooperating with IVO (Nursing and Care Review) to get to the bottom of what has happened, and before that we cannot go into detail regarding an individual case. 'We are of course taking this complaint very seriously, as we do with all complaints,' Sahlgrenska Hospital's press spokesperson Stefan Sarajärvi said this week.","Jimi Fritze, 43, could hear but not talk after suffering brain haemorrhage .

"Jeremy Lin, the newly-minted King of New York who has won the affection of the whole city by leading the Knicks to five straight wins, has finally found an apartment of his own... in suburban White Plains. The night before his stellar performance that beat the New Jersey Nets last week, Lin crashed on the couch at a teammate's apartment after he found himself without a place to stay. Now he has rented a $3,800-a-month two-bedroom apartment in a Trump highrise in downtown White Planes, New York. Now he as another incredible win to his name, as Lin scored the vital 3-point shot right at the buzzer of Tuesday night's game against the Toranto Raptors. Linsanity: Tuesday night's win is sure to fire up even more excitement about Lin's stunning turn of late . Upgrade: Jeremy Lin has snagged a lease on an upscale apartment at Trump Tower in downtown White Plains . Lin credits his success on the court and his sudden rise to fame to his decision to put his fate in the hands of God. 'Sometimes you come up against a mountain and you end up making the mountain seem bigger than God,' Lin told the San Jose Mercury News. 'I was on pins and needles. I was putting all this unnecessary pressure on myself. Now, I feel like I'm free out there.' Lin is a Taiwanese-American from Palo Alto, California, who was raised in the Chinese Church in Christ in nearby Mountain View. He has maintained his devout Christianity through playing at Harvard University and a rocky and uncertain start to his professional basketball career. His Christian devotion and meteoric rise to stardom is reminiscent of Tim Tebow, the Denver Broncos quarterback who improbably led his team to the playoffs this fall. Lin takes to the court tonight -- only his fifth game as a starter in the NBA -- in Toronto when the Knicks face off against the Raptors. New digs: The upscale apartment in White Plains is home to several other Knicks players and some New York Rangers, as well . Downtown: Lin's building is prime real estate... in the suburban city of White Plains in Westchester County . In the span of five games, Lin has gone from warming the Knicks' bench to the cover of Sports Illustrated. And until now, had no home in New York. The 6-foot-3 point guard slept on his brother's couch at his apartment on New York's Lower East Side. His new digs are modest compared to the multimillion-dollar mansions of his extravagantly-paid star teammates. But they're palatial for a guy whose bed was a sofa up until last week. The apartment building, which is home to several other Knicks players and a few New York Rangers, boasts 9-foot ceilings, marble bathrooms, cherry wood floors and a built-in sound system, the New York Daily News reports. From the 20th floor, Lin should be able to see New York City -- the town he now runs -- in the distance. Breakout performance: Jeremy Lin has become an overnight sensation for his explosive play on the court since the game against the New Jersey Nets last week . Famous couch: Jeremy Lin crashed here, at Landry Fields' apartment, before his stunning performance against the New Jersey Nets . Lin is currently on the minimum salary contract for the Knicks -- a two-year, $1.2 million deal. However, some are worrying that the team will be unable to afford to keep him around at the dramatically higher salary he will no doubt demand now that he is a starting player. Lin said admit the success and ravenous media attention, he is trying to stay focused on surrendering control of his life to God's will. 'If you look back at my story, doesn't matter where you look, but God's fingerprints are all over the place where there have been a lot of things that had to happen that I couldn't control,' he told the Daily News. The night before his February 4 breakout game against the New Jersey Nets, NLin found himself homeless. The sofa where he usually slept at his brother Joshua's Lower East Side New York City apartment was taken -- there was a party that night there. Believe the hype: Lin, a devout Christian, seemed equally excited about the Tuesday win in Toronto . So Lin shacked up at the modest White Planes, New York, home of teammate Landry Fields. And crashed on his coach, a simple brown sofa. The couch is now one of the most famous pieces of furniture in NBA history. The next day, Lin, 23, captured the hearts of New Yorkers and the attention of basketball fans around the country with his explosive play -- a career-high 25 points, five rebounds and seven assists. He's gone from sitting on the bench to the Knicks' starting lineup as the team has gone on a five-game winning streak. And it all began on a couch. 'Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only couch made famous by @JLin7! Let the bidding begin,' Fields tweeted Sunday afternoon. Lin, a 6-foot-3 point guard who played for Harvard University, said the couch was 'decent, but not huge.' After his stunning performance against the New Jersey Nets, Lin told reporters about his accommodations the prior night: 'Thank you to Landry for hosting me. I think I might just move in with him,' he said. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .","Lin had been sleeping on his brother's couch but moved to Landry Fields' sofa the night before the New Jersey Nets game .

"He may have thought the worst of the Vegas ordeal was behind him as he tries to distance himself back in the UK from his partying antics. But one lone source has claimed the nude strip billiards picture of the Prince is nothing compared with the rest of the story. A single quote from an anonymous source, used by celebrity blogger Norm Clark on his Las Vegas gossip page, says: 'Something pretty gigantic' is involved; something more . serious than 'strip billiards'. Scroll down for video . Before the party: Prince Harry was snapped in Las Vegas admiring a tall blonde, who has been named as 27-year-old Danielle Davidson, before hosting a private party in his hotel room . The claim is the latest in a string of revelations to potentially tarnish the third-in-line-to-the-Throne's Royal image. Last night, The Palace had no comment on the vague accusation. After a nude photo of the Prince emerged last week from a private party in a hotel room in Las Vegas, Prince Harry has removed himself from Facebook, where he operated under the pseudonym Spike Wells. Following advice from his private secretary, . Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, who is heading an inquiry into the Prince’s . trip to Las Vegas, Harry deleted his account. The Mail on Sunday has been told that . the Prince’s two best friends, Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, 25, who joined him . in Vegas, and Arthur Landon, 30, have also closed their Facebook . accounts, as has one of his key Scotland Yard minders. The latest comment to surface surrounding the 27-year-old's antics has no implicit context, but could be linked to concerns raised by the Prince following the US publication of the derobed heir. The Prince was said to be ‘terrified’ further damaging images might emerge and his concerns intensified after . photos of an ‘even wilder’ week in the British Virgin Islands on Sir . Richard Branson’s private island of Necker, shortly before the Vegas . weekend, were leaked to a newspaper. Pictures from the trip were originally posted on Facebook by one of Harry's friends. Stills from the US showbusiness channel ExtraTV show the Prince at a party in Las Vegas surrounded by bikini-clad women . Further pictures have emerged from Prince Harry's Las Vegas trip which followed immediately after the Necker sojourn. The Prince is seen partying in swimming shorts, a hat and sunglasses, surrounded by bikini-clad women. Harry, Inskip and rugby player Adam Bidwell, 36, were among his entourage who checked into a £5,100-a-night suite on the 63rd floor of one of the city’s most elite resorts. 'The . suite is in a tower that has its own private casino,' said a maid. 'It . has mohair walls to absorb the sound, a pool and a wet bar.' They ate and drank at the hotel's most exclusive bars and restaurants, including the most expensive restaurant, the SW Steakhouse, . named after the complex’s owner Steve Wynn, who reportedly picked up the . £50,000 bill for their visit. Harry appeared to show an interest in the 27-year-old blonde, a cocktail server at the MGM Grand Hotel . The rowdy group then moved on to one of . the hotel’s nightclubs, Surrender, where they were ushered into the . red-curtained VIP area. They . are understood to have picked up two girls at the club for the party where the naked Prince was captured on fuzzy mobile phone shots and sold for £10,000 . to the TMZ website. At 1.30pm the next day, just seven-and-a-half hours after the now infamous 'strip billiard' game, Harry is believed to have hosted a second vodka-fuelled  pool party with a dozen ‘randomly recruited’ girls. ‘Girls were . invited to come over and meet Harry,’ according to a source. Scotland Yard minders looked on as the girls were ushered inside the private villa – or cabana – at the MGM Grand . Hotel’s Wet Republic club, according to the source. The party went on for five-and-half-hours. ‘What . is incredible is that his detectives didn’t request any special . security at Wet Republic,’ said the source. ‘They had no requirements . whatsoever. His handlers just sat around while friends went to . neighbouring private areas that had been rented by rich guests, inviting . their girls to come over and meet Harry.

"'Murderous rage': Julia Gillard has left politics since losing her incumbency in June . Former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard made an extraordinary attack last night on the 'violent, ugly sexism' she said she experienced during her three years in charge of the nation. It reached the point when the British-born politician felt 'murderous rage' at seeing the sexist cartoons and comments that had been made online about her, she said. 'For my personal liberty, it's probably a good thing that I didn't focus on them,' she remarked in her first public appearance since she lost the Prime Minister's job to Kevin Rudd in June. Speaking at a public forum at the iconic Sydney Opera House, Miss Gillard - who has now resigned from politics - said she was surprised at the depth of abuse that had been levelled at her as the country's first female Prime Minister. 'I find it depressing and a surprise that really violent, ugly sexism still exists in Australia,' she told the enthusiastically supportive audience. 'It just amazes me that we can be having this infantile conversation about gender wars and you just feel like saying ""Well, if it was your daughter and she was putting up with sexist abuse at work, what would you advise her to do?' She added: 'Because, apparently, if she complains, she is playing the victim and playing gender wars - and if she doesn't complain, then she really is a victim.' Women and girls, said Miss Gillard, had a right to an environment 'that treats you with respect, treats you as an equal and raising your voice about that isn't starting a war, it isn't playing the victim, it's just asking for what simply is right.' During the interview with feminist author Anne Summers, Miss Gillard said she had believed that Australia was beyond the kind of thinking that woman were not being treated with respect - 'and it's kind of depressing that we (the country) are not. Scroll down for video. 'Women deserve respect': Women and girls, said Miss Gillard, had a right to an environment 'that treats you with respect, treats you as an equal and raising your voice about that isn't starting a war, it isn't playing the victim, it's just asking for what simply is right' 'But at least we know exactly where the balance of it is now and what more remains to be done for women to be truly equal.'

"Former world heavyweight champion boxer and convicted rapist Mike Tyson tonight said he was 'greatly disappointed' when he discovered he is banned from entering the UK. Tyson, 47, was due in London this week as part of a promotional tour for his new autobiography Undisputed Truth, which included a photocall with journalists and a book signing at Waterstones. His publishers said recent changes to UK immigration laws meant he was unable to travel to the country and has been re-routed to Paris instead. Banned: Former world heavyweight champion boxer and convicted rapist Mike Tyson cancelled a trip after he couldn't enter the UK because of his conviction . Tyson is currently booked in for a British tour for his one-man Broadway show, directed by Spike Lee, which is booked for eight nights in March next year in London, Glasgow and Manchester. In a statement, Mr Tyson said: 'I was greatly disappointed when I learned of United Kingdom’s immigration law changes that went into effect December 2012. 'I have been coming to the UK consistently in the past decade so this change is disheartening since it affects my current entry standing. 'I apologise to my fans that were inconvenienced, however, please know I am currently working diligently with the proper authorities to regain access next year for my UK tour. 'I am currently stationed in Paris, attending to press that was scheduled for my visit this week in London. 'I am very much looking forward to talking about my book, Undisputed Truth, and UK tour, and very appreciative of the British press for being so accommodating in the interim. 'I have a great deal of respect for the laws of the United Kingdom and will continue taking the proper steps for re-entry.' Tweets posted on Tyson’s official Twitter account as recently as Friday suggest the boxer was unaware he would be hit by the changes until the last minute. He wrote: 'So, UK fans, who is brave enough to get in the ring and ask me a question?' And then in subsequent tweets added: 'Tweet me a question with #UndisputedTruthBook in it. The 5 best get to step in the ring & ask me it in person' and 'Ok, lots of questions there. If you’ve won, @harpercollinsUK will be in touch soon. Thanks everyone for participating.' A spokesman for HarperCollins said: 'There was a change in the UK immigration law in December 2012 of which we were unaware. For this reason Mike had to change location to Paris to salvage his press obligations for the UK.' He was convicted in 1992 for the rape of a teenage beauty queen, and served three years of a six-year sentence. He also has convictions for assault, cocaine possession and driving under the influence. Under the new immigration rules, any person who has been sentenced to more than four years in prison is barred from entering the country. Tour: Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson was due in London this week as part of a promotional tour for his new autobiography . The explosive boxer was the youngest man ever to become heavyweight champion of the world after he beat Trevor Berbick in 1986 when he was just 20. But throughout his career he also courted controversy. He bit opponent Evander Holyfield’s ear, went bankrupt, lost his four-year-old daughter in a tragic domestic accident, and was jailed. A Home Office spokeswoman said: 'We would not comment on the details of an individual case.'We reserve the right to refuse entry to the UK to anyone who is convicted of serious criminal offences. 'In December 2012 we toughened up the rules on entering the UK, replacing the previous discretionary approach with a clearer, stronger framework including mandatory refusals based on the length of, and time since, sentence.” Campaigning group Ending Victimisation and Blame, which tackles disbelief around domestic and sexual violence, said: 'We are delighted that Mike Tyson is not being allowed into the UK due to his previous convictions, one of which was for rape. 'We believe that this sends a message that his criminal actions have long-term consequences - sadly, the consequences for his victim seem to have been forgotten by both Mike Tyson and his supporters.'","Tyson, 47, was due in London this week as part of a promotional tour .

"A wealthy Serbian bachelor has been posting pictures of himself in his mansion in the hope that his wealth will lure in a lady. And if his obvious opulence wasn't enough to tempt potential suitors, he has also donned a series of snappy outfits, including a pink dressing gown. In a note attached to the photos, the man who calls himself Don Milisav Juan Gonzales Brzi, says: 'To all unmarried ones who would like to spend their life by my side and within all the beauties of my home. Form a line, ladies: Serbian bachelor Don Milisav Juan Gonzales Brzi is hoping his wealth, interior design skills, and impeccable dress sense will find him an 'unmarried one' to share his life with . In a bizarre series of pictures the eligible man is seen sitting in various rooms around his mansion home . Snappy dresser: Mr Brzi is seen wearing everything from dressing gowns to dinner jackets . 'Please look below at all the magic of my home that I have decorated with taste, perhaps just for YOU.' The bizarre snaps have been circulating on Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian websites and have since gone viral. In them the grey-haired singleton is seen standing awkwardly in his bathroom, 'relaxing' on a bed and kneeling in what appears to be a hallway. Sexy in silk: in one of the more 'relaxed' pictures Mr Brzi is seen in nothing but silk pyjamas . If red really is the colour of love then he will surely have no problem attracting a partner with those shoes . Won't you join me? In this image Brzi relaxes in his baby-blue boudoir, presumably awaiting the arrival of his new wife . Mr Brzi claims to be 39-years-old, living in St Petersburg and looking for a much younger 16-20-year-old for a relationship and marriage. The Serb displays a clear love of the finer things in life, with everything from his bed to his bidet finished with gold trim. Artwork and painted frescoes decorate nearly every wall in his home, including in both of the huge bathrooms. Dinner for two? Brzi is hoping that somebody will join him for a romantic meal before marrying him . In this picture Brzi sits calmly in his slippers, holding a samurai sword, while Christmas decorations appear to hang in the background . Midas touch: after gold plated tables and toilets Brzi continues his love for the precious metal on this sofa set . The privileged man could be making himself out to be wealthier than he is, as several of the shots appear to be on the same room but from different angles. Here the sofas from the last image are clearly visible (bottom left) Whoever takes up his offer will have to deal with the cold weather, as temperatures can plummet as low as -5C in winter. Perhaps the young lady in question could borrow one of Brzi's fur coats to keep warm in, as he appears to have several. Either the pictures were taken around Christmas-time, or Mr Brzi is slow to take his decorations down, as tinsel and baubles feature in the background of several shots. In another festive photograph Brzi is seen outside in front of a snow covered pine tree complete with decorations . Hotting up: with a quick change into some other, very warm, furs the supposed 39-year-old is ready for another snap in the study .

Despite appearing on Eastern European websites months ago, it is not known whether or not Mr Brzi ever found his dream nubile bride. It is difficult to image how he would have been unable to attract a partner given his dashing looks and dapper dress sense. If he has been unsuccessful, he might want to consider adding a profile to one of the many dating sites which cater exclusively to wealthy men seeking younger women, such as sugardaddie.com. Brzi's interior design taste even stretches as far as classical architecture, which probably helped to inspire this mosaic floor .

"Dozens of elderly Chinese people have been killing themselves to avoid a looming ban on burials. The elderly suicides want to make sure their deaths are registered before a June 1 deadline, after which Anhui province authorities will close all cemeteries. Anyone who dies after that date will have to be cremated because, authorities say, cemeteries are taking up too much space. A father pushes his baby down a road past a pile of coffins smashed by officials to drive home the looming ban on burials brought in because cemeteries are taking up too much space in Anhui province, China . In order to drive the message home council officials have been visiting funeral parlours and smashing up coffins. The draconian move has only hastened the rate of suicide as elderly people rush to guarantee one of the few remaining. The new rules were published on April 1. Regional officials said: 'Before June 1 people can still consign their bodies for burial, but after that the only option offered will be cremation.' In urban areas it has meant little change, but in rural areas the idea of cremation is abhorrent to many and there has been extreme opposition. Local media has reported dozens of cases in which elderly people have killed themselves in order to qualify for a burial. Zhang Wenying, 81, hanged herself on May 13. She left behind a note saying she had ended it all to make sure she could have a decent death, and she expected to be buried. Another was 97-year-old Wu Lixiu, who died on May 12. There have also been deaths in the provincial capital, and in three villages elders recorded at least seven people who have committed suicide to make sure they are buried instead of cremated. 'It's hard for the old people to accept the policy, so the government should give them more time to think about it, but not carry out the policy on such short notice,' said one elder.","Anhui province, China, is to ban all burials after June 1 .

"For decades it had gathered dust in a box on top of a wardrobe among a war hero’s possessions. But an entry within this tatty pocket diary appears to offer corroboration to claims that Adolf Hitler fathered an illegitimate son. Yesterday one of former Royal Engineer Leonard Wilkes’s sons said the diary could offer the earliest written record of the story of Frenchman Jean-Marie Loret, who went to his grave believing Hitler was his father. Diarist: Former Royal Engineer Leonard Wilkes, left and right, his son Alan, 72 with his wartime diary where he details meeting a woman who claimed she had given birth to a son by Hitler . The sensational entry in Mr Wilkes' wartime diary which adds weight to the claims that Hitler fathered a son . Alan Wilkes came forward after reading . about new information last month that adds weight to Mr Loret’s claim . to have been conceived during a brief relationship between his mother . and the then young German corporal during the First World War. Leonard was one of the first soldiers to land on the Normandy beaches on D-Day in June 1944. Over the following months he kept a . diary as the Allies fought to liberate France and among the pages filled . with neat writing in capital letters is a sensational reference to the . alleged liaison between Hitler and Charlotte Lobjoie in the summer of . 1917. On September 30 in 1944 Leonard, who . was from Small Heath, Birmingham, wrote: ‘An interesting day today. Visited the house where Hitler stayed as a corporal in the last war, saw . the woman who had a baby by him and she told us that the baby, a son, . was now fighting in the French army against the Germans.’ The diary claims add weight to evidence that emerged last month that Jean-Marie Loret, right, was the lovechild of Adolf Hitler, left . Jean-Marie Loret, who was born in March, 1918, grew up knowing nothing about his father, apart from the fact that he was German. It . was only in the late 1950s, just before her death, that his mother, . Charlotte Lobjoie, finally told him the story that was to haunt him for . the rest of his life. According to her story, the . relationship began in 1917. Although Hitler, then 28, was fighting the . French near Seboncourt, in the northern Picardy region, he made his way . to Fournes-en-Weppe, a town west of Lille, for leave. There . he met Miss Lobjoie who apparently later told her son: . ‘One day I was cutting hay with other women, when we saw a German . soldier on the other side of the street. He had a sketch pad and seemed . to be drawing. All the women found this interesting, and were curious to . know what he was drawing. I was designated to approach him.’ The . pair started a brief relationship and  she said Jean-Marie was . conceived after a ‘tipsy’ evening in June 1917. He was born the . following year. According to information from Mr Loret’s lawyer, Miss Lobjoie told her . son: ‘When your father was around, which was very rarely, he liked to . take me for walks in the countryside. ‘But . these walks usually ended badly. In fact, your father, inspired by . nature, launched into speeches which I did not really understand. He did . not speak French, but solely ranted in German, talking to an imaginary . audience. ‘Even if I spoke . German I would not be able to follow him, as the histories of Prussia, . Austria and Bavaria were not familiar to me at all, far from it. My . reaction used to anger your father so much that I did not show any . reaction.’ Three days later, his battalion . marched on towards Brussels. He made no further reference to Miss . Lobjoie or her lovechild and never mentioned it to his family on his . return home from war. Leonard was married to Doris for more . than 50 years and worked as a machine presser. The grandfather of five . and great-grandfather of 18 died in 1991, aged 76. His son, from Ward End, Birmingham, . said he discovered the diary with his brother, Gordon, 68, following the . death of their mother ten years ago. Mr Wilkes, 73, said: ‘It was kept . in a box. We were going to throw it out. I was shocked when I read it. My father never spoke to me about the war and, until he died. I never . even knew the diary existed.’ The brothers did not think the diary . would be of interest to anyone outside the family until new claims . emerged in French magazine Le Point last month that Hitler may have had a . son while serving as a soldier in France. Mr Loret was born in March 1918 and his mother told him about his father shortly before her death in the late 1950s. Mr Loret died in 1985, aged 67, having . never been able to prove his heritage. But his lawyer, Francois . Gibault, gave Le Point documents to support his claims. The lawyer said Miss Lobjoie told her . son the relationship with Hitler began in 1917 when the future Nazi . leader was aged 28 and fighting the French in Picardy. The pair met when . Hitler travelled to the town of Fournes-in-Weppe, near Lille, for . leave. According to Mr Gibault, she later told her son: ‘One day I was . cutting hay with other women, when we saw a German soldier on the other . side of the street. ‘He had a sketch pad and seemed to be . drawing. All the women found this interesting, and were curious to know . what he was drawing. I was designated to approach him.’ The pair started a brief relationship . and she said Jean-Marie was conceived after a ‘tipsy’ evening in June . 1917. He was born the following year. Miss Lobjoie spoke to her son about . his true heritage many years after she had given him up for adoption in . the 1930s to a family called Loret. Mr Loret grew up to fight the . Germans in 1939 and later joined the French Resistance. Mr Loret later discovered that German . officers brought envelopes of cash to Miss Lobjoie during the  Second . World War. After she died, he found paintings in her attic which were . signed by Hitler. Meeting: Hitler reportedly met the woman in the town of Fournes-en-Weppes in Northern France .

"Two tries from Thomas Waldrom saw Exeter stun champions Northampton 24-18 at a wet Franklin's Gardens. With six players on international duty and another two injured, a well-drilled Exeter led 21-6 at the break and held off a second half Northampton comeback to record their first Aviva Premiership win at the Gardens. Exeter shocked the champions after just 90 seconds by opening the scoring with a try from Luke Cowan-Dickie. Don Armand of Exeter Chiefs escapes the grasp of Mike Haywood of Northampton Saints . Teimana Harrison and Alex Waller of Northampton Saints tackle Kai Horstmann of Exeter Chiefs . The visitors won their own kick-off and almost - and probably should have - scored through Jack Nowell, but the England winger was just hauled short by Tom Collins and Ben Foden, forcing Collins to limp off. The Chiefs had a penalty anyway and when they kicked to the corner hooker Cowan-Dickie was on the end of the lineout drive. Gareth Steenson converted before Stephen Myler pulled Saints to within one point with two penalties but Exeter peppered the home side with long kicks to keep them pinned in their half. A strong and quick defence saw Saints stuck, save for a clever lineout move that saw Luther Burrell, back from the thumb injury that kept him out of England’s opening autumn international defeat, charge up to the Chief’s 22, but his chip was smothered by white shirts. The suffocating Exeter defence got its reward when Waldrom intercepted Mike Haywood’s pass on halfway, and despite Lee Dickson catching him five metres short the big number eight slid over for a try converted by Steenson. Jamie Elliott of Northampton Saints is tackled by Thomas Waldrom of Exeter Chiefs . Mike Haywood of Northampton Saints receives medical treatment during the Premiership clash . Northampton thought they had their opening try when Samu Manoa ghosted out of ruck on his 10 metre line to sprint clear. He reached with 15 metres of the try-line and passed inside to Dickson but the scrum-half was caught by opposite number Will Chudley. Dickson’s offload went to ground and Haywood knocked on trying to pick it up with the line in sight. Exeter thought they had a third try just before the break but the TMO ruled there was no obvious grounding by Phil Dollman. But it mattered not as Waldrom picked up from the ensuing five metre scrum to charge over for his second try. Steenson converted to give Exeter a commanding lead at the break. A Remembrance Day ceremony was held before the game at Franklins Gardens . The visitors could have killed the game off straight after the interval when flanker Don Armand broke through from a lineout on Saints’ 10-metre line, but a penalty ended the attack. Exeter players punched the air when they saw off a lineout drive minutes later and with 26 minutes to go Steenson added a penalty to make it 24-6. But the pressure was building and Saints finally got their first try thanks to the pace and great hands of James Wilson as he passed inside to send Tom Stephenson. From five metres in from the touch, Myler made it 24-13 with 20 minutes left. Ten minutes later and relentless pressure saw Jamie Elliott wriggle over in the left corner, but Myler missed the touchline conversion to leave Northampton six points behind. Steenson missed with a drop goal with five minutes to go, but the Chiefs held out for a famous win.","Thomas Waldron scored two tries in Exeter's 24-18 win at Northampton .

"The football fan who claims he was assaulted by Roy Keane at the Republic of Ireland's team hotel has demanded a public apology from the former Manchester United hard man. Frank Gillespie claims the Ireland assistant manager pushed him at the Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links in Dublin, on Tuesday afternoon, sending him tumbling over a table after he asked for an autograph. Gillespie has since met with lawyers and is planning to take legal action if Keane does not apologise, the Irish Independent reported. Claims: Frank Gillespie (left) claims the Ireland assistant manager (right) pushed him at the Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links in Dublin, on Tuesday afternoon, sending him tumbling over a table after he asked for an autograph . Keane called police following an incident outside the team's hotel in Portmarknock yesterday . The Football Association of Ireland, however, have dismissed reports of a bust-up as 'inaccurate' saying that no apology would be issued. Ireland manager Martin O'Neil also backed Keane yesterday saying his number two had his 'full support'. Gillespie, an old acquaintance of Keane from his playing days, claims the alleged incident began when the Irish soccer legend emerged from the hotel to find him waiting with a copy of his autobiography, The Second Half. Gillespie says he asked Keane: 'Will you sign this for (my son) Trevor?' He alleges Keane then challenged him over a book he himself wrote in 2004, a football-fan's diary entitled 'Confessions From The Blackthorn', demanding to know what gave him the right to write about football. In the argument that ensued, Keane's autobiography fell to the ground, at which point Gillespie picked it up and began tearing out it's pages, it is claimed. It was then that Gillespie claims Keane shoved him to the ground before leaving the scene. 'I did not hit him - I was terrified of him,' Mr Gillespie told The Star newspaper. 'He cannot walk up to one of the best Ireland fans in the last 25 years and treat them like that.' The Football Association of Ireland stressed last night, that reports that Keane had been involved in a bust-up at the Republic of Ireland's Dublin base were 'inaccurate' The Republic of Ireland are currently preparing for their crunch European Championships qualifier against Scotland on Friday night in Celtic Park, Glasgow . Mr Gillespie added that he had spent hours at Beaumont Hospital, and said he has injuries including 'a very bruised neck and a bump on my head'. An Irish police spokesman confirmed  that an investigation had been launched into the incident. 'Gardai are investigating an incident where officers were called to a location outside a hotel in Portmarknock. No criminal complaint has been made and investigations are ongoing. Medical assistance was rendered.' The Football Association of Ireland confirmed that Keane called the police following the incident outside the Republic of Ireland's team hotel where they are preparing for tonight's . The statement said: 'Following inaccurate media reports which refer to an incident involving a member of the public this evening at the Republic of Ireland team hotel, we wish to clarify that Roy Keane called the Gardai following the incident. 'The manager, Martin O'Neill and the FAI are fully aware of the circumstances surrounding this event, and the Assistant Manager has their full support.' The Republic of Ireland are currently preparing for their crunch European Championships qualifier against Scotland tonight in Celtic Park, Glasgow. O'Neill has also moved to scotch claims of disruption within his ranks over the alleged row. In a statement to camera on Wednesday, the Irish boss said he was aware of the facts of the incident and remains fully supportive of his right-hand man. 'The FAI and I have been fully briefed about the circumstances about what happened at the team hotel last night,' said O'Neill. The Football Association of Ireland said Keane had the 'full support' of manager Martin O'Neill (right) 'Roy asked that the Gardai be called and he has notified them of what happened. 'While this process is ongoing we are unable to say more at this point. However I can say that, having been made aware of the facts, that Roy has both my full support and the full support of the FAI and (FAI chief executive) John Delaney.' Hours before the team travel to Glasgow ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier tie with Scotland, O'Neill added: 'We are now focused, as we have been all week, on the game in hand and we won't be saying anything more about this issue.' The Irish soccer legend is no stranger to controversy, but this is certainly his most serious incident since taking the assistant manager's role for the Irish soccer team. As a player, Keane injured himself trying to tackle Alf-Inge Haaland in a game against Leeds in 1997. Haaland initally accused him of feigning injury. Four years later, Haaland claimed Keane effectively ended his career, after a reckless tackle during a Premier League soccer match in 2001. Keane also famously scrapped with his Manchester United compatriot, Peter Schmeichel. The Danish goalkeeper was significantly bigger than Keane but that did not stop the Irishman leaving his colleague with a black eye after head-butting him during a clash on tour. Keane later revealed: 'I had a bust-up with Peter when we were on a pre-season tour of Asia. There was drink involved. Keane leads the training session in the rain at Gannon Park, Malahide this morning . The Irish soccer legend is no stranger to controversy, but this is certainly his most serious incident since taking the assistant manager's role for the Irish soccer team . 'The manager had a go at us as we were getting on the bus, and people were going on about a fight in the hotel the night before. It started coming back to me - the fight between me and Peter.' Keane was again the subject of a major controversy when after arriving in Asia for the 2002 World Cup, he voiced his disapproval of the team's poor training facilities at the Irish camp in Saipan. In front of the entire Irish side, during a routine team meeting, he berated Mick McCarthy, then manager of the Irish side. He was later sent home and played no part in the rest of Ireland's World Cup campaign. Roy Keane was also involved in an infamous tunnel spat in 2005. Keane became irate after he saw Patrick Viera allegedly 'bullying' one of Keane' s teammates and an altercation ensued. The Football Association of Ireland offered Keane their full support after the alleged incident involving a member of the public at the Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links in Dublin yesterday afternoon, pictured . The soccer hero also has a tetchy relationship with his former manager at Manchester United, Alex Ferguson. During their 12 years together at United, eight of which Keane spent as captain, the pair helped bring seven English Premier League titles, one Champions League trophy and four FA Cups to Old Trafford. But the relationship deteriorated after Keane launched a scathing attack on some of his team-mates during an interview with United's in-house television channel, MUTV, which was never broadcast, in November 2005. Since then both Ferguson and Keane have criticised one another in their respective autobiographies. The former Irish international published 'The Second Half' this year. Keane said in his second autobiography, 'The self-destruct button is definitely there. And I suffer for it.. 'I think it was my way of switching off, never mind the consequences. It was my time. It was self-destructive, I can see that, but I'm still drawn to it. Not the drink – but the madness, the irresponsibility.'","Roy Keane called police after incident inside Irish team hotel in Dublin .

Hibbard came on for the last seven minutes of the match which will infuriate Welsh national coach Warren Gatland who did not include him for selection against Fiji in Cardiff on Saturday due to an ankle injury. Fly-half Billy Twelvetrees kicked four penalties and replacement Aled Thomas landed one for Gloucester against tries for Quins by number eight Nick Easter, flanker Luke Wallace and wing Charlie Walker, with fly-half Nick Evans booting a penalty and two conversions. Gloucester's Richard Hibbard (centre) turns his head after making a controversial late appearance . Hibbard's appearance from off the bench will leave Wales boss Warren Gatland seething . Hibbard practices a throw during the warm up at Kingsholm . But it was the sight of Hibbard running out onto the field as a replacement for hooker Darren Dawidiuk that will have Gatland seething. Earlier on Friday, Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde said he would ‘jeopardise his position’ with them if he came off the bench. On the pitch, Twelvetrees, at stand-off instead of James Hook who was called up by Wales during the week and was one of seven Gloucester men on international duty, who made the biggest impact in the opening half. Twelvetrees, returned from the national squad this week, gave England coach Stuart Lancaster something to think about ahead of the clash against Samoa at Twickenham in eight days. He was in fine form around the pitch and booted four out of six first-half penalties, one from just inside his own half to put the Cherry and Whites into a 12-0 lead.

And it could have been more as Quins, with six regulars on international duty, struggled to get out of the starting blocks for half an hour. A desperate tackle from Quins centre George Lowe just denied full-back Rob Cook a try after he was put in by winger Henry Purdy. Suddenly, Quins woke up and wing Charlie Walker almost got a touchdown as his kick ahead on the right bounced near the line. Home wing Charlie Sharples made a hash of collecting the loose ball and nearly handed it back to Walker but somehow saved his own bacon. It was only temporary relief, though. Gloucester seemed to lose their thread and, from an attacking line-out five metres from the Cherry and Whites end, Quins rolled an maul for lock George Robson to drive skipper Easter over the line. Evans converted and then landed a 35 penalty five minutes from the break to put his team right back in the match. Gloucester captain Billy Twelvetrees kicked four penalties during his side's home defeat . Gloucester James Hudson leads the players off the pitch after defeat by Harlequins . And the Londoners grabbed the bull by the horns after the interval. Tight-head prop Kyle Sinckler was a thorn in the Gloucester defence’s side and wing Ollie Lindsay-Hague came within 10 metres of a try on the left but was bundled into touch. For all their endeavour , Quins failed to score as the Cherry and Whites slowly re-gained their composure, forced mistakes but, now, Twelvetrees had lost his accuracy and failed with two long-range penalties. But Quins burst back into life and the rolling maul tactic which brought Easter his try did the trick again as they swirled the home eight around left and right for flanker Wallace to touchdown in front of the posts, making Evans’ second conversion simple. Replacement Thomas landed a fifth Gloucester penalty to claw it back to 17-15 but the victory was sealed when Evans kicked through a gap to send Walker over for the score to give Quins a great win on the road and Gloucester only a losing bonus point.","Richard Hibbard was a controversial inclusion in the Gloucester squad .

"Manchester United legend Paul Scholes believes Premier League clubs should think twice before signing his former team-mate and Barcelona defender Gerard Pique. The Spaniard left Old Trafford for La Liga in 2008 and has gone on to win 15 major club titles, but is now on the fringes of the first team and has been a linked with a return to England. But Scholes insists the Barca style suits the centre back, who he says while he is a 'very talented defender', Pique would find it difficult operating in a team without possession. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pique: Louis van Gaal pushed me over and said I wasn't tough . Paul Scholes believes Gerard Pique would find it tough in the Premier League were he to return . The Spanish defender played for four years at Old Trafford but was sold for £5million in 2008 . Paul Scholes says Pique prefers it when his team is in possession and he may not be comfortable in England . 'I have always thought that Spanish football, and Barcelona in particular, suits him best,' Scholes revealed in his column in The Independent. 'He likes being in a side that keeps possession. He is great at home but playing away at the big teams in England is a completely different prospect for a defender. 'His success at Barcelona and with Spain has been incredible. But I think Gerard would find it harder back in the Premier League.' Pique made just 33 competitive appearances during his four seasons at Old Trafford, after United poached him from the Catalan giants as a teenager. Pique, here jumping with Nemanja Vidic during the Champions League final, would struggle with the physicality . Pique has won 15 major club titles since leaving Manchester United for Barcelona . He went straight into Pep Guardiola's starting XI, as Lionel Messi and Co emerged as one of the greatest club sides in history.

"The Labour leader is expected to lambast the retailer over zero-hours contracts . Ed Miliband will today accuse a major high street firm of ‘Victorian management practices’ for using zero-hours contracts for eight in ten of its staff. The Labour leader will lambast Sports Direct for employing so many of its 20,000-strong workforce on the contracts, despite many of them working regular shifts. He will pledge to ban the contracts if he wins the next election, giving employees the legal right to a regular contract if they work regular hours. But last night Tories accused Mr Miliband of hypocrisy, as several Labour-run councils employ zero-hours staff. Doncaster Council, the authority in Mr Miliband’s constituency, has admitted it employs 300 people on the contracts. Freedom of Information inquiries show that in 2013, Derby Council employed 1,333 people on the contracts, Gateshead 1,285 and Bury 3,418. All are run by Labour. It came as a poll of business leaders found just 14 per cent trust Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on the economy. Nearly six in ten prefer David Cameron and George Osborne. The YouGov survey, commissioned by the Conservatives, also found six in ten thought the Tories would deliver a ‘strong and healthy economy for Britain’ compared with just 12 per cent for Ukip. Sports Direct is owned by billionaire businessman Mike Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United Football Club. Mr Miliband will accuse the firm of being a ‘bad place to work’. ‘Sports Direct has predictable turnover, it is a modern company with stores on many high streets and, judging by its success, where many people shop,’ he will say. ‘But for too many of its employees, Sports Direct is a bad place to work. This is not about exceptional use of zero-hours contracts for short-term or seasonal work … This is the way Sports Direct employs the vast majority of its workforce. Many of the company's 20,000 strong workforce are on zero-hours contracts despite working regular shifts . ‘These Victorian practices have no place in the 21st century.’ Mr Miliband is expected to say it is unfair that around 1.4million workers are on zero-hours contracts while some at the top appear to pay no tax at all. But Tory business minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Another rehashed policy from Ed Miliband can’t hide the fact that he still hasn’t got an economic plan … We’re already tackling the abuse of zero-hours contracts – after 13 years of Labour doing absolutely nothing about it.’ No one at Sports Direct was available for comment.","Labour leader will lambast Sports Direct over zero hour contracts .

"The talk among England fans leaving Twickenham last Saturday was about predictable topics: a soporific second half and some erratic kicking. But a new development at HQ was also under discussion: the giant television screens showing replays. For some they represent the inevitable and welcome march of technology. For others they have the potential to have a malign influence the game. The giant television screens at Twickenham had a significant effect on England's game against New Zealand . Former England coach and Sportsmail columnist Sir Clive Woodward is among those who feel there should be strict protocols in place if England are to avoid criticism of abusing their home advantage at the 2015 World Cup. Against New Zealand the constant use of big-screen replays — and the inevitable partisan reaction of England fans — appeared to play a part in referee Nigel Owens’s decision to yellow card All Black hooker Dane Coles. It might also have contributed to Owens’s late decision to review New Zealand’s third try just before the conversion was being attempted. All Blacks hooker Dane Coles (right) was sin-binned after TV replays picked up his foul play in a ruck . Coach Steve Hansen was not impressed: ‘My biggest concern is not the TMO (television match official) or the refs. My biggest concern is that TV directors are starting to have an influence on the game.’ Woodward shares Hansen’s concerns, saying: ‘England have got to be really careful about home advantage and with my Olympic hat on I feel qualified to talk on this. ‘While you want to encourage massive home support there is a solid red line which you must never cross. Nigel Owens stops Beauden Barrett from taking a conversion as he consults the TMO to check on the try . ‘You must never ever do anything which could be perceived in any way as influencing the result. ‘The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games worked hard in 2012 to ensure fairness because it could have totally undermined the Games. ‘There would have been uproar in the athletes’ village and the media would have had a field day on reports of any perceived GB bias. The first thing that needs to be nailed down with the big screens is who makes the decision to show what and when. And then a protocol must be put in place. Owens awards a late penalty try to England after the home pack got a great shove on the All Blacks forwards . 'You must show tries from both sides the same number of times. You show alleged incidents of foul play the same number of times. You can’t have these “Come on England” signs flashed up. I sense Steven Hansen was annoyed on Saturday and so would I be if I was the visiting team. ‘Are referees influenced by crowd noise? Yes, definitely. Before an international I used to study refs much more than any opposition player because they have a much bigger influence on the game. ‘Assistant refs reporting to them are influenced by crowd noise. And then you magnify that by the crowd reacting to the big screen. ‘Sky has no say in what pictures go on the big screen, but if they choose to dwell on a try decision or an incident that is their editorial decision.’ Owens (centre) plays an advantage to England during the first half of last Saturday's clash at Twickenham . Former England wing Mark Cueto is strongly in favour of the screens. ‘Big screens are here to stay,’ he says. ‘We had a couple of games at the start of the season at Sale without a big screen and it was an absolute killer in terms of the atmosphere. ‘Everybody is standing around wondering what’s happening. If you are asking people to pay good money to support the game you can’t exclude them from all the key moments and drama which everybody else back home or in the bar is enjoying. When a big screen is available I would do something a bit radical and cut out the conversation between the referee and the TMO. ‘I hate all this, “Try or no try?” or “Is there any reason I cannot award a try?” stuff. The only question that matters is “What happened?” ‘The TMO should go through all the camera angles and then put the “money shot” up on the screen for the referee to decide. It puts pressure on the ref but everybody is under pressure on match day.’ VIDEO O2 Inside Line, Season 5 - Episode 2 .","The use of big-screen replays played a key role in several of referee Nigel Owens’s decisions during England's 21-24 loss to New Zealand .

"Claudio Ranieri is on the verge of being sacked as Greece coach after his side lost 1-0 to the Faroe Islands on Friday to continue their miserable run in Group F of the European Championship qualifiers. Greece have lost all four of their qualifiers so far, but the defeat at home to the Faroe Islands, who recorded just their 20th win since beginning international play in 1988, represented a new low. In a statement on the Hellenic Football Federation's website, HFF president Giorgos Sarris admitted he was sorry for ever hiring Ranieri - apparently suggesting he would be sacked imminently. Greece coach Claudio Ranieri looks on from the touchline as he watches his side lose to the Faroe Islands . Faroe Islands' Joan Edmudsson (second right) celebrates with his team-mates after scoring against Greece . 'Following today's devastating result for the national team, I take full responsibility for the most unfortunate choice of coach, which has resulted in such a poor image of the national team being put before the fans,' Sarris said. 'The governing board will convene and take responsibility among all the members to make the necessary changes needed to avoid a repeat of such an embarrassing night.'

We were wrong in believing that was a straightforward group for us. All defeats hurt equally, but we must leave results in the past and work our way out of this situation. 'We are last in our group because that is what we deserve. The coach is always responsible for that.

"England's plans to field an unchanged team against South Africa on Saturday were shattered by another injury setback on Tuesday night — leaving Anthony Watson poised to replace fellow Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni. Having revealed at lunchtime that Rokoduguni trained fully in the morning, hours later the national coaches were forced to rule him out of the QBE Test at Twickenham. The Fiji-born soldier suffered a thigh injury in the 24-21 defeat against New Zealand last weekend. In response to the unwelcome development, England retained Marland Yarde in their squad to play the world’s No 2-ranked side. However, Watson — who made his Test debut off the bench against New Zealand — is set to start on the right flank; having long been identified by Stuart Lancaster as a player of star potential. Anthony Watson (above) is poised to replace Semesa Rokoduguni, who has been ruled out of South Africa Test . Rokoduguni suffered a thigh injury during England's 24-21 defeat to New Zealand last weekend . Head coach Lancaster said: ‘Roko did some limited training but is unlikely to fully recover from his thigh injury in time for the game so Marland is in the group.’ There are also concerns about Northampton flanker Tom Wood, which has led to Wasps captain James Haskell being kept on standby. Lancaster added: ‘Tom is still sore from the weekend and sat out training so we are including five back rows to give us options.’ Wood will be given every chance to prove he is fit to face the Boks, as part of the same pack which started the match against the world champions four days ago. Tom Wood (above) is also an injury concern as head coach Stuart Lancaster said he sat out training . Watson (above) made his Test debut when he came off the bench during the New Zealand defeat . 15 Mike Brown (Harlequins) 14 Anthony Watson (Bath) 13 Brad Barritt (Saracens) 12 Kyle Eastmond (Bath) 11 Jonny May (Gloucester) 10 Owen Farrell (Saracens) 9 Danny Care (Harlequins) 1 Joe Marler (Harlequins) 2 Dylan Hartley (Northampton) 3 David Wilson (Bath) 4 Dave Attwood (Bath) 5 Courtney Lawes (Northampton) 6 Tom Wood (Northampton) 7 Chris Robshaw (Harlequins, capt) 8 Billy Vunipola (Saracens) Sportsmail understands Lancaster and his coaches had resolved to field an unchanged team, having decided that a fifth successive loss against the peerless Kiwis is no cause for panic. Having identified the need to generate attacking fluency and cohesion, Lancaster, Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt wanted to give the same line-up another chance. That ambition was dashed by Rokoduguni’s thigh problem, but earlier there had been better news. Bath centre Kyle Eastmond returned to training after illness, thus delaying the prospect of George Ford and Owen Farrell being reunited as a 10-12 axis which proved mighty effective at age-group level. Northampton forwards Dylan Hartley and Courtney Lawes are expected to be passed fit, despite both suffering concussion last weekend. As ever, midfield remains a focus for debate. The possibility of a Ford-Farrell alliance came to the fore due to England’s kicking deficiencies against the All Blacks. However, the latest centre partnership — the 10th employed under Lancaster; Eastmond and Brad Barritt — acquitted themselves well with a limited supply of prime possession. Sportsmail understands Lancaster had wanted to name an unchanged side against South Africa . But the injury to Rokoduguni means changes will be made for the game against the number two ranked side . Catt is well versed in the perennial English search for the most effective double-act in the 12 and 13 shirts, having been involved in it as a player and now as a coach. On Tuesday, he said: ‘I think it worked very well at the weekend. From a defensive point of view we were very solid and from an attacking one, we were very limited by what we got. ‘But we saw what Kyle could do in the first Test in New Zealand when we got front-foot ball — the right type of ball. Kyle and Brad are on top of their game. You have got two guys that are massively confident at the moment. Lancaster was full of praise for Kyle Eastmond (above) for his performance against New Zealand . Lancaster added that Eastmond's partner in the centre Brad Barritt (centre) is on top of his game . ‘Kyle is doing all right with Owen and we expect a big performance this weekend, too.’ Catt also acknowledged the need for midfield continuity, which has often been an elusive target due to disruptive injuries. At present, Manu Tuilagi and Luther Burrell are out of the selection equation but Catt knows England need to stick, rather than keep twisting. ‘There is good competition in those areas but it is about consistency,’ said the World Cup-winner. ‘At the end of the day you want a good established 12 and 13 who can do a job for you. You want to get the combinations right. Barritt runs with the ball during the England media session held at Pennyhill Park on November 11 . South Africa hope to make up for defeat in Dublin by making England suffer at Twickenham on Saturday. John McFarland, South Africa’s assistant coach, says the Springboks believe holding England to 15 points or less will provide a platform for victory. He said: ‘If you concede less than 15, you have a good chance of winning Test matches, but we know we’ve got big improvements to make.’ ‘Luther and Billy Twelvetrees did exceptionally well in the Six Nations. Luther is injured now and Kyle has had a fantastic start to the season, so he deserves his shot. Brad has been exceptional for Saracens yet again and he deserves a shot.’ Barritt has often been classified as a wonderfully effective defensive centre without any positive credentials as an attacking force. But it was his fine pass which teed up Jonny May’s early try against New Zealand and Catt added: ‘Brad does the simple things very well. Billy Twelvetrees passes the ball during the England training session at Pennyhill Park on Tuesday . The England team lined up to observe a two minutes silence on Armistice Day at 11 o'clock . ‘He carries the ball well and what he brings to the team is what you don’t see. It is how he makes the team feel. ‘He is one of the leaders. He is composed, he gives the guys solutions on the pitch and everybody feels very comfortable with him around.’ England are on high alert about the prospect of facing a Springbok side who are reeling from their emphatic defeat against the Irish in Dublin last Saturday. Catt spoke about the need to ‘stop the big green machine rolling’ and added: ‘We know what is coming.’","Stuart Lancaster wanted to field unchanged team from New Zealand defeat .

"Kehren Sajid outside court following an earlier hearing. The nursery nurse has been sentenced to a 12 month community order after mistreating four toddlers . A nursery nurse who dragged a toddler across a mat like 'a rag doll', dangled others by their arm and threw a 17-month-old onto a mattress close to a radiator has avoided a prison sentence. Kehren Sajid, of Handsworth in Birmingham, was today sentenced to a 12-month community order for five charges of common assault on four toddlers in the Winnie the Pooh playroom of the city's Small Talk Nursery last year. Judge Elizabeth Fisher told the 31-year-old: 'By virtue of their age, the children were vulnerable victims.' She added: 'It is not surprising to learn that one . of the mothers of the children concerned is angry at the way in which . her child had been treated by you. 'Nevertheless . it is clear you are remorseful for what occurred, for the way in which . you treated these young victims, your lack of nurture and care. 'It is clear you need assistance as far as victim awareness is concerned.' The crimes came to light after manager Rachel Barr saw CCTV footage of the assaults.

"Matches in Greece's professional soccer leagues have been suspended indefinitely after a referees' committee official was admitted to hospital following a violent attack, the Hellenic Football Federation (EPO) announced on Friday. Police said that 45-year-old Christoforos Zografos, assistant director of the Central Refereeing Committee (KED), was beaten with wooden clubs in the early hours of Friday by two men on a motorcycle in the Kolonos area of Western Athens. 'After an emergency meeting of the Board of Directors, EPO has decided not to appoint referees from Monday (17 November) following the murderous attack on a member of the KED/EPO, hence the indefinite postponement of all matches in all divisions in order to protect those involved,' EPO said in a statement. Hugh Dallas, far right, is a former professional referee now in charge of referee administration in Greece . PAOK (pictured) are top of the Greek Super League, but will not be playing 'indefinitely' The board added it would not appoint referees to any league matches until 'immediate steps' were taken to protect match officials. Zografos, a former FIFA referee, works under retired Scottish referee Hugh Dallas, who was appointed head of the KED in the close season after continued pleas from Greek clubs for a foreign official to take on the administrative role following several match-fixing scandals in recent seasons. Matches have already been suspended once this season by the government in late September as a mark of respect following the death of a fan after violent clashes at a third division match. Ethinikos Piraeus supporter Kostas Katsoulis, 46, suffered serious head injuries following clashes with Irodotos fans in Crete during the match on Sept. 15. Vital Information . Olympiakos Piraeus president Evangelos Marinakis said he had vital information about the attack on Zografos which he would give to the police and Greek soccer chiefs and he called on all stakeholders in Greek football to put a stop to violence. 'The police and legal authorities need to look into this in great depth, we must all work together to stop this filth,' he told reporters after a meeting of Super League officials. 'I went to the meeting to discuss names and say what I've learned from my colleagues and collaborators about this murderous act,' former Super League president Marinakis added. 'We are talking about human lives here, it's no longer about an insult, or bitter comments which are said on the radio or television in the heat of the moment; we are talking about a murderous attack on the man that is very lucky to be alive.' Marinakis also said he was available to help police with their enquiries into the incident and made references to evidence of threatening behaviour towards referees which he said was rife in the lower divisions. 'All of this is highly unacceptable and it will not be long before we find it in front of us in a few months in the Super League - that's why we have an obligation to denounce it and end it here.'","Christoforos Zografos was beaten with wooden clubs on Friday morning .

"The attorney for two woman who have already pleaded not guilty to the murder of a 23-year-old woman says it was the victim who threw the first punch. Candace Brito, 27, and Vanesa Zavala, 25, are each accused of killing Annie Hung 'Kim' Pham outside a Santa Ana nightclub on January 18. Their attorneys say that a new witness statement reveals that Pham's friends were part of a gang and that Brito and Zavala were acting in self-defense. Held: Vanesa Zavala appears in a Westminster courtroom with her attorney, Ken Reed, for a arraignment hearing Friday, February 21 . Suspects: Vanesa Zavala (left) and Candace Brito attend a preliminary hearing  in the West Justice Center earlier this month to determine if they will go on trial for the murder of Kim Pham . 'There have been some developments in the case that directly implicate the Asians standing in line in terms of gang affiliation,' Michael  Molfetta, attorney for Brito told the OC Register. 'They were the aggressors, the instigators.' He says the prosecution knew about the witness but kept it from the defense. The witness, Alfonso Magana, told Santa Ana detectives that Pham beat up his girlfriend the night of the fight. When Magana tried to help his girlfriend, men from Pham's group jumped in and chased him, shouting the name of a gang. 'It explains what occurred and why it occurred and it puts to rest this ridiculous assertion that a lack of cooperation from the Asian community in this case was somehow a cultural thing,' Molfetta said, reports the OC Register. 'Now we know why. Gang members do not cooperate with law enforcement.' Killed over a photo?

Attorneys for the prosecution say there is no evidence that the fight was gang related and that new revelations make no difference to the case. 'It doesn't matter who was the initial aggressor,' Pino said, reported City News Service. 'The bottom line is she's on the ground defenseless as these two defendants kick her in the head. And that's what killed her.' A witness to the fatal beating of a . girl attacked for an ‘accidental photobomb’ described to a 911 . dispatcher how ‘there were guys and girls hitting her’.

Kim Pham, 23, outside The Crosby Club in Los Angeles. After . being connected, the witness said: ‘There’s a fight right here off . Broadway and 4th Street. There’s a girl that’s unconscious.’ The dispatcher asked how the girl came to be unconscious and if anybody had any weapons. The female witness said: ‘No, there were guys and girls hitting her.’ After . the dispatcher reassured her that paramedics would be dispatched . immediately, the witness said that Ms Pham suddenly started breathing. She said: ‘She’s breathing now. She just took a deep breath.’ The . dispatcher is told that the people that beat Ms Pham up had run off and . appeared to be ‘Asian men and women probably around 23 or 24 years . old’. She added: ‘One of the . security guards picked her up and she p***** herself. I don’t know if . that matters.

Caught on camera: Orange County Superior Court Judge Thomas Borris, left, stands up to tell the court to dim the lights at the West Justice Center in Westminster while a video showing the deadly fight is presented Monday . Prosecutors say the kicker is murder suspect Vanesa Zavala. Immediately after the kick, Pham goes limp and the clip ends with her friends lifting her by her arms as they try to carry her away. Zavala and Candace Brito have pleaded not guilty. A judge will determine after the two-day hearing that began Monday whether there is enough evidence to order them to stand trial. Police have reviewed three videos of the violent confrontation from bystanders. Other footage appears to show Brito kicking Pham as well before Brito is knocked to the ground by another woman. Investigators are still seeking to interview a third woman, identified in court testimony as ‘Amelia,’ who they say is the person wrestling on the ground with Pham when she is kicked. Just who started the fight outside The Crosby in the early morning hours of Janiary 18 is in dispute. A witness told authorities the fight began after Pham started swearing at a group of people that she and her friends had bumped into outside the club, and that Pham threw the first punch.

Plea: Posters put near the crime scene appealing for information about the tragic January incident . Pham's friends countered that three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation after they bumped into her while trying to take a picture. Defense attorneys have repeatedly indicated that Pham's friends might have minimized her role in the fight and their involvement. They have also been picking at the police investigation, pointing out that detectives have not positively identified another woman who can be seen on video kicking at the woman who is fighting Pham. ‘You don't even know who that person is, do you? You don't even know if she's in any way connected to Ms. Pham, do you?’ Brito's attorney, Michael Molfetta, said to Santa Ana police Detective Leo Rodriguez. ‘You haven't investigated it because you've decided those two are guilty of murder and everybody else is a victim. That's why you haven't followed up on this, isn't it?’ Molfetta said to Rodriguez, who denied the statement. Lawyers for both sides reached an agreement Tuesday about how to handle testimony from a homicide detective who went undercover while wearing a wire and got Zavala to talk about the fight. The attorneys accepted as evidence for the preliminary hearing only that Zavala told Detective Patricia Navarro, ‘”She hit me first. I acted in self-defense.”’ On Monday, Judge Thomas J. Borris ordered Navarro to stop her testimony after she acknowledged going undercover as an inmate to record Zavala after she had requested a lawyer. At a preliminary hearing Monday, Santa Ana police Detective Roland Andrade said he was told by a witness that Pham began swearing and was restrained by friends as the other group walked away. However, when the three girls returned, Pham threw the first punch, Andrade quoted the eyewitness as saying in to the Westminster court.

The two women have been charged in the beating death of 23-year-old Kim Pham . Police are still investigating a third woman as a person of interest and have reviewed three cellphone videos of the fight. Defense attorneys said Monday that the third, unidentified woman was actually the person who began fighting with Pham.

Forensic Pathologist Dr. Etoi Davenport, who conducted the autopsy on Kim Pham. testifies about the blunt force trauma to Pham's brain during a preliminary hearing for Candace Marie Brito and Vanesa Zavala in the West Justice Center in Westminster on Monday . Kenneth Reed, an attorney for Zavala, introduced the idea that Pham's friends might have minimized their involvement and Pham's role in the fight. 'You just kind of took the story - ""She got beat"" - and you just kind of took the statements of these friends of hers?"" Reed said. 'Fighting means fighting, more than one person fighting, right?' Pham, who went by the first name Kim, graduated from Chapman University last year and would have celebrated her first wedding anniversary last month. She was an aspiring writer whose work was published online and in an anthology of works by Vietnamese-American writers.unidentified woman was actually the person who began fighting with Pham. Pham was taken off life support after the beating. The coroner listed Pham's cause of death as blunt force injury of the head.

On January 29, three days before what would have been her first wedding anniversary, hundreds of mourners attended her funeral held in Westminster, California on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Her husband led the pallbearers who helped carry her casket to her cremation. ‘I always try to have a tough-guy mentality, be the protector of our family, but she was the one who taught me how to let down my guard and to share something beautiful,’ her stepbrother  Jason Nguyen said at the service. Her family kept her on life support until they could donate her organs- only learning that she was an organ donor once they arrived at the hospital- which her family thinks is telling of the person she was. Organ registry One Legacy site announced that Pham's donations helped save five lives. Her heart, kidneys, lungs, pancreas and liver were used for critical patients and her donated skin tissue was used for burn dressings, bones that could help fractures and prevent amputations, and her bone marrow is available for orthopedic use.

"A 54-year-old truck driver 'obsessed with vampires' is accused of keeping women as sex slaves while he traveled the country for work. Authorities say Timothy Jay Vafeades kidnapped at least two women, including a 19-year-old relative, and held them against their will in his semi trailer for months at a time, where he raped them and beat them until they passed out. While being held captive, Vafeades filed down the 19-year-old victim's teeth with a dremel after telling her she 'had an ugly smile' and forced her to wear dentures while he wore his own pair with vampire fangs. Bad trucker: Timothy Jay Vafeades is accused of kidnapped at least two women and holding them against their will in his semitrailer while he traveled the country for work. One of his victims says he wore dentures with vampire fangs, which he seems to be donning in the above Twitter picture . The truck driver made his first appearance in Minnesota court on Wednesday as he faces charges of kidnapping, transportation for illegal sexual activity and posession of child pornography. If convicted he could face between 10 years and life in prison. An arrest warrant filed Tuesday in Salt Lake City claims Vafeades kidnapped the 19-year-old relative who had come from Florida in May 2013 to work with him on his truck, named the 'Twilight Express.' Public records indicate Vafeades has been running Twilight Express Trucking since 2009, meaning the business name could very well be a reference to the popular vampire book series by Stephenie Meyer which was turned into a film franchise starring Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. On their first night on the road, the victim recalls waking up to Vafeades sexually assaulting her. She asked what he was doing and he stopped and the next day the two traveled on to Wyoming. After a week on the road, the teen told Vafeades she wanted to go home and she grabbed her belongings and went to exit the trailer. Scroll down for video . Intimidator: Vafeades successfully kept two women hostage in his semitrailer for months at a time by threatening to beat them if they made eye contact or spoke with anyone . But Vafeades stopped her in her tracks, hitting and strangling her until she blacked out. For the next six months, Vafeades kept his relative captive with threats and intimidation while they traveled to Washington, Nevada, Texas, Tennessee and other states. Vafeades confiscated the teen's ID and social security card and took the SIM card out of her cell phone so she couldn't make any calls. She was also forbidden from using public restrooms and was beaten if she made eye contact with strangers. Despite her pleas, Vafeades forced the teenager to have sex with him more than 100 times during their time together, a criminal complaint states. Vafeades was arrested at a Clay County, Minnestota, weigh station on November 26, just a few days before Thanksgiving, after officers noticed bruises on the teenager and discovered a 1999 restraining order barring Vafeades from contacting the girl. Meeting place: Vafeades' second victim says she agreed to go out to dinner with him after meeting him at this truck stop in Salt Lake City, but that he kidnapped her and held her hostage for months . After his arrest, a second woman went . to authorities to report she had been held captive in Vafeades' truck, . according to the warrant. The . woman told detectives she met the driver at the Sapp Brothers Truck Stop in Salt Lake City in April 2012. She agreed to have dinner with him and got into his . truck, according to the report, but Vafeades told her about 10 minutes . into the ride that she was going with him for a week or more. The . woman said Vafeades kept her with him for about three months through . threats and violence, forcing her to have sex with him nearly every day . and calling her his slave, authorities said. According to her report, Vafeades told the victim that he 'owner her, that she was never getting out, and that she would do what he told her to do'. He too forbid his victim from making eye contact or talking with anyone, especially men, and if she did he would beat her with a belt while she lay naked on the trailer's sleeper bed. The victim said these beatings happened regularly, sometimes daily and other times weekly. She said he had her hair cut and colored to disguise her identity and forced her to marry him. Both . women said Vafeades watched child pornography often, and a police . search revealed he kept 'hundreds' of child porn videos and pictures on . external hard drives. The 19-year-old victim reported that the porn appeared to show girls about 14 years of age. He also forced the women to do his company paperwork, and never paid them for the work. The . trucker faces state charges in Minnesota in addition to the federal . counts. He is in the Clay County Jail awaiting transfer to Utah.","Timothy Jay Vafeades, 54, is accused of kidnapping at least two women and holding them in his semitrailer while he traveled the country .

"Arrested: Spanish police have taken in Shoja Shojai, pictured . A British millionaire accused of fathering seven children with aspiring models he kept against their will in a Costa del Sol harem has been arrested by Spanish police. Shoja Shojai, 56, allegedly met many of the woman in London, telling them he was an oil tycoon who was friends with Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin. Police were called to his luxury Arabian-style palace in Marbella after one of the women reportedly filed a domestic violence claim against him. Now nine of the women living at the rented mansion have accused him of luring them to Spain under false pretences - subjecting them to emotional abuse and threats of physical violence in order to keep them there. The women, who knew Shojai as 'Sasha', had originally come from across Europe and Asia, including Russia, Germany, Mongolia and Kazakhstan, before meeting him while studying at a London fashion school. Several were said to have told police they came to Spain on the promise he would help them gain a foot in the door of the fashion industry. Once they arrived they were put up in a ten-bed mansion on the property in the hills above Marbella called Casa Saf and took turns to sleep with him. Iranian-born Shojai, whose British passport was issued in January 2008, lived in an adjoining house called Casa Nabil. The women have told police they were . allowed out of the mansion at all times - but only with on of Shojai's . drivers and on the condition that they told him where they were going and what time they were returning. Palace: Millionaire Shoja Shojai, 56, is accused of fathering seven children with aspiring models he kept against their will in a Costa del Sol harem . Opulent: Shojai used this ten-bedroom mansion to hold his harem . Grand: Some of the women claimed they were forced to contribute thousands to the rent . Lavish: Locals described the women coming and going from the house in designer clothes surrounded by staff . They claim he threatened reprisals against their children and families if they disobeyed him. The wealthier women, said to come from moneyed backgrounds, say they were made to pay the £6,500-a-month rent on the property. Spanish newspapers have reported that police found date rape drug Rohypnol . during a search of the property after the women complained of suffering . headaches and being made to take drugs including anti-depressants. Officers also reportedly found letters addressed to Shojai inviting him to give House of Commons lectures. Shojai has been released on bail while a court in Marbella continues to investigate the claims before deciding whether to charge him. The women and their children, aged nine months to seven years old, have been taken to nearby refuges. Spanish detectives are now expected to ask police in Britain to make inquiries on their behalf about Shojai and his alleged victims, and an investigating judge has ordered the women to undertake drugs tests. A spokesman from the Metropolitan Police in London said Spanish authorities were yet to make contact regarding Shojai. Harem: Several of the women told police they came to Spain on the promise that Shojai would help them gain a foot in the door of the fashion industry . Location: The women were put up in a ten-bed mansion on the property in the hills above Marbella, and took it in turns to sleep with him . Psychologists will also interview them and file a report to the judge with their conclusions on the womens’ state of minds. Shojai, believed to have lived at another mansion in nearby Estepona before moving to Marbella, has denied all the accusations against him. He claims the women worked for his companies, consented to sex with him, and fell pregnant because they failed to take precautions.  He also denied mistreating them emotionally or physically during a police interview. The entrepreneur, who is prevented by a restraining order from approaching the women while the allegations are investigated, has also asked police to investigate the alleged theft of millions of pounds of jewellery, works of art and Persian rugs during the two days he spent in police cells. Lawyers representing the women have rejected his claims they may be involved. Shojai was only married to one of the 10 women he lived with, but it unknown if the 33-year-old Danish woman is among his nine accusers. 'The women were very young and very pretty and were usually impeccably dressed in designer clothes' Shojai is understood to have returned alone to his rented ochre-coloured mansion, which is partially hidden behind high walls and palm trees and has two stone lions outside one of its two entrances. He has not made any public comment on the claims. A worker at the property told respected local newspaper Diario Sur he did not believe the women were being held against their will. He said: 'They left in the mornings in their cars without any problems to take their children to school. 'I can only say what I saw during the day though. I’ve no idea what happened at night.' A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'The women were very young and very pretty and were usually impeccably dressed in designer clothes. 'They were always accompanied by workers when they left the house in 4x4s that looked like chaffeurs who doubled up as bodyguards. 'They always kept themselves to themselves and didn’t seem to want much to do with the neighbours but I never suspected they might be kept there against their will. 'Apart from one or two, they didn’t look unhappy when I saw them. “I rarely saw the man the police arrested but he was just as discreet.' Another added: 'There were always a lot of pretty women coming and going from the house but I just thought there were several different families living inside the house. I didn’t know the children all belonged to one father.'","Shoja Shojai, 56, has been arrested by Spanish police over claims .

"Britain is becoming of singletons, partners and co-habiters, as the number of people choosing not to marry has rocketed by 3.6million in just a decade, according to new figures. The final results from the 2011 census from across the UK show that more than a third of the population - around 17.8million people - now class themselves as single. This means the number of British singletons has increased by a quarter - while the number of divorcees has risen by a fifth to 4.5million people. Bridget Jones generation: Renee Zellweger played Helen Fielding's famous singleton in the film version of the eponymous diarist's life story . Same-sex civil partnerships, which did not even exist a decade earlier, accounted for around 113,000 people in 2011 census. The figures also show that - thanks, experts say, to mass immigration and a baby boom - the proportion of people old enough to marry who have chosen to do so has fallen from 51 per cent to below 47 per cent. Many couples now choose to co-habit rather than tie the knot in the traditional way. But the figures also betray the phenomenon of the 'Bridget Jones generation' - named after the single heroine of Helen Fielding's novel series, and describing men and women of marriage age who remain unmarried. Yet despite the decrease in traditional mother-and-father couples, the number of family cars . on British roads is increasing twice as fast as the human population. Meanwhile, the number of widows fell by more than 300,000 as men catch up with women in terms of life expectancy. There are also one million more pensioners than there were a decade ago and 600,000 more full time unpaid carers, while one in six Britons is over 65. Immigration has also soared - spurred by the expansion of the EU - and foreign-born residents now account for 13 per cent of the UK's population. Some 8million foreign-born people now live in the UK - a 4.1 million increase on the 4.9million of 2001, which has boosted the British population to 63.2 million. The number of Polish-born people living in the UK has increased tenfold in a decade. Four in ten Londoners are from an ethnic minority - although in Northern Ireland non-white people account for only two per cent. The wedding: Colin Firth and Renee Zellweger play Mark and Bridget when they did eventually get hitched... although Helen Fielding's latest novel sends Bridget back to singledom . And it gives a glimpse of lifestyles have changed even more than the population. Despite the impact of environmentalism and a renaissance in cycling, the number of family cars on British roads are increasing twice as fast as the human population. Yet, in a vivid illustration of the impact of the impact of improvements in medical care, the number of widows in Britain fell by more than 300,000 – in evidence that men are finally closing the gap on women in life expectancy. Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation think-tank said that it was undeniable that marriage was losing its popularity - but stressed that it is still widely seen as the desirable way to bring up children. 'It's misleading to look at the population as a whole - the majority of families with children - five eighths of couples with children - are married,' he said. But what is a worrying is the way the trend away from marriage reflects the rise of family breakdown. 'Although the number of divorces has gone down, over the last ten years, the rise in family breakdown is due to a very simple equation - the rise in family breakdown is due to the decline in marriage.","Around 17.8m Britons - a third of the population - say they are single .
Number of divorcees up by a fifth in a decade to 4.5m people .
There are around 113,000 civil partnerships in Britain, 2011 census shows .
Many couples choose to co-habit or marry later in life, experts say .
Immigrants now form 13% of population - from 4.9m in 2011 to 8m in 2011 ."

"This is the moment a heroic 16-year-old rugby tackled a thug to the ground after seeing him attack two female police officers. Kiya Ingham chased and restrained Bradley Jay Hughes, 31, after he violently assaulted two WPCs on a busy road in Brighton, East Sussex. The keen kick boxer has now been given a top bravery award for assisting WPC Lynsey Burkinshaw and WPC Johanna Clarke and plans to become a police officer. Scroll down for video . Kiya Ingham chased and restrained Bradley Jay Hughes, 31, after he assaulted two WPCs in Brighton . He said: 'I took interest at what was happening inside the police car and sat at the bus stop for about 30 seconds. 'Then the man flipped. I dropped my bag, which had my tablet and phone in, and ran after him. I didn't think, it was just instinct. 'When I was running I was just hoping I could get him down, because if he did that to police officers he could do worse to me. 'You can see him point at me and say 'I know your face'. The officers were speaking to Hughes  as Mr Ingham arrived at the bus stop after arresting him over a domestic incident in June . Hughes lunged at the officers as he forced his way out of their patrol car, with Mr Ingham sitting nearby . A bare-chested Hughes then escaped their grasp and began sprinting away from them . But after Mr Ingham tackled him, WPC Lynsey Burkinshaw and WPC Johanna Clarke were able to hold him down . 'He was being aggressive and swearing at me, but then back-up arrived and he was taken away.' The two policewomen had arrested Hughes over a domestic incident on June 10, but he kicked out after being put into the car and attempted to escape. In the video he is shown shoving them out of the way and wrestling with them on the ground. Hughes from Seaford has since been convicted after pleading guilty to two counts of assaulting a police officer and received 100 hours community service. Chief Superintendent Nev Kemp, Brighton and Hove Divisional Commander, said: 'Kiya acted heroically and I commend his bravery. The keen kick-boxer has now been given a top police bravery award for assisting the WPCs . Speaking after he received his award, Mr Ingham said: 'You can see him point at me and say 'I know your face' 'I was delighted to recognise his actions with an award in our Brighton and Hove Divisional awards ceremony, attended by Katy Bourne the Police and Crime Commissioner earlier this year. 'Kiya received a huge cheer and round of applause from everybody at the event when the footage was shown. 'The incident shows how difficult and sometimes dangerous policing can be, so we were very grateful and moved that without hesitation he stepped into help the police in such a situation. 'I also want to pay tribute to the way in which the two officers quickly regained control of the situation, despite the violence that was directed towards them. I and my team here thank him for his courage and selfless public service which helped us bring an offender to justice.'","Kiya Ingham, 16, chased and tackled  Bradley Jay Hughes, 31, in Brighton .

"A would-be marriage proposal turned into a fight of life and death for one New England pilot. Mark Simmons had just taken off in his Piper with a banner proclaiming the words: ‘Will you marry me?’ But words of romance turned into words of terror as the plane went down, with Mr Simmons yelling out several ‘mayday’ radio alerts. But thanks to a Good Samaritan, and the pilot’s brave son, the pilot was rescued unscathed from the water. Scroll down for video . Survival: Mark Simmons, pictured centre, survived crashing into the ocean after his Piper Pawnee plane carrying a 'Will You Marry Me' banner malfunctioned . Crashed: His plane crashed into Block Island Sound, pictured . Mr Simmons was flying his Piper Pawnee plane, having taken off from the Westerly Airport yesterday afternoon. Connecticut’s The Day reports that he lost power 10 minutes into his flight. The Coast Guard, hearing his call, sent out a helicopter and a response boat. Mr Simmons’ son Ethan helped the Coast Guard quicken their search, telling them that his father had just taken off. Meanwhile, Mr Simmons was preparing for the crash landing. He told The Westerly Sun that he removed his seat belt and grabbed a floating tire. Trail: Mr Simmons took off from the Westerly Airport, and was flying towards Block Island where he crashed . Help: The Point Judith Coast Guard sent out a rescue boat, but Mr Simmons had already been rescued by a Good Samaritan . Even though he was calm and prepared, he told the paper: ‘Nothing prepares you for sitting in the ocean by yourself.’ By the time the Coast Guard arrived, Mr Simmons had already been rescued from the Block Island Sound by a civilian boater.

"Novak Djokovic made a ruthless start to the defence of his ATP World Tour Finals title as he beat Marin Cilic in just 56 minutes. The world No 1 dominated proceedings throughout at the O2 Arena with a 6-1, 6-1 victory, which is his 28th win in a row on an indoor court. Djokovic said: 'It was a great performance. I was hoping I could play this way. I was preparing myself for this match. I knew already one week ago that I was going to play Marin. Novak Djokovic walks out on court to play against Marin Cilic at the O2 Arena . 'You could see that he didn't feel so comfortable. I tried to use my experience playing on this stage, the stadium, which is pretty different from any other.' Djokovic had won all ten of his previous meetings against Cilic and never at any point on Monday night did it look like this particular contest would end any differently. The first break of the match came in the third game with US Open champion Cilic nervously putting a forehand wide as he faced break point. Two stunning forehand cross-court passes helped Djokovic seal the double break for 4-1 and a tame Cilic backhand into the net ended a 27-minute first set. World No 1 Novak Djokovic dominated proceedings throughout on Monday night . Another Cilic error saw Djokovic claim the early break in the second set, although he did halt the Serb's run of eight straight games as he immediately broke back with a blistering forehand down the line. Hopes of a possible Cilic revival were swiftly ended, however, as the Croat sprayed yet more groundstrokes and Djokovic won four games in a row to seal a comfortable victory. Two more wins in the round-robin stage for Djokovic will see him secure the year-end No 1 ranking and he looks odds on to do so given his dominance under a roof in the last two years. Djokovic next faces Stan Wawrinka on Wednesday in what will be their first meeting since the Swiss won a thrilling Australian Open quarter-final back in January.

"Equatorial Guinea will replace Morocco as hosts of the Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco will not host the 2015 tournament because of its fears over the Ebola outbreak elsewhere on the continent, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) confirmed. As a result CAF expelled Morocco, who would have qualified as hosts, from the finals. Equatorial Guinea have replaced Morocco as hosts of 2015 African Cup of Nations starting on January 17 . Confederation of African Football (CAF) president Issa Hayatou decided to expel Morocco from the tournament . It is an oil-rich nation which became independent from Spain in 1968 . Main language is Spanish and religion Roman Catholic . It is made up of a mainland territory called Rio Muni, and five islands including Bioko, where the capital Malabo is. One of Africa's smallest countries, pop: 622,000 . Fang is the most predominant ethnic group - nearly 86% of the population . Its currency is the Central African Franc . It has a tropical climate - it will be the dry season in Bioko but wet in Rio Muni . Co-hosted the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations with Gabon . Capital Malabo is one of four venues along with Bata, Ebebiyin, Mongomo. Three nations expressed an interest to host the tournament due to take place from January 17 to February 8. Equatorial Guinea were also thrown out of the tournament in July for fielding an ineligible player during the qualifying process, but will now be reinstated as hosts. The man who organised the 2008 event in Ghana has already expressed fears that starting the cup on time will be impossible. Dr Kofi Amoah said: 'It could be a sham. I don't think there is enough time for anyone to do it.' CAF President Issa Hayatou insists: 'The 2015 Africa Cup of Nations must absolutely take place from January 17th to February 8th.' Egypt stated it would not host the tournament for 'economic and political reasons', while 2013 and 2008 hosts South Africa and Ghana also ruled themselves out of contention. Qualification matches for the tournament will continue as planned on Friday and Saturday to decide which 15 teams will join the new host country for the finals. Morocco had expressed fears an influx of foreign fans could help spread the Ebola epidemic. The North African country is scheduled to host Fifa's Club World Cup next month, featuring Champions League winners Real Madrid. It said it was willing to continue with its hosting duties for that tournament because it did not expect many supporters to travel from Ebola-affected regions.

"Russian academics are working on unlocking the secrets of a mystery medieval civilization on the edge of the Siberian Arctic - which had links to Persia. A burial ground has been found with human remains mummified seemingly by accident - and wearing copper masks. But who they were remains a puzzle to Russian archeologists and experts. A red haired man was found, protected from chest to foot by copper plating, among a group of bodies in a mysterious burial ground in northern Russia . A genetic study will now be carried out on the remains in a bid to solve the riddle of where the people came from . A total of 34 shallow graves have been excavated by archeologists at Zeleniy Yar, 18 miles south of the Arctic Circle, and included a small treasure trove of jewellery and artifacts indicating this was a trading outpost of some importance around one millennium ago. 'The medieval necropolis include 11 bodies with shattered or missing skulls, and smashed skeletons,' reported The Siberian Times. 'Five mummies were found to be shrouded in copper, while also elaborately covered in reindeer, beaver, wolverine or bear fur. 'Among the graves is just one female, a child, her face masked by copper plates. There are no adult women.' Three copper masked infant mummies - all male - were unearthed nearby. They were bound in four or five copper hoops, several centimetres wide. A red-haired man was also found, protected from chest to foot by copper plating. In his resting place, was an iron hatchet, furs, and a head buckle made of bronze depicting a bear. A total 34 shallow graves were uncovered by archeologists working at Zeleniy Yar, Russia, which is 18 miles south of the Arctic Circle . As well as copper plating, the bodies were covered in reindeer, beaver, wolverine and bear fur . The feet of the deceased are all pointing towards the nearby Gorny Poluy River, a fact which is seen as having religious significance. Yet the burial rituals are reported to be unknown to experts and not typical of others in this cold and inhospitable region. Artifacts included bronze bowls originating in Persia, some 3,700 miles to the south-west, dating from the tenth or eleventh centuries, it is believed. 'One of the burials dates to 1282, according to a study of tree rings, while others are believed to be older,' reports The Siberian Times. A bronze bowl (top left) and a silver plate found beside the burials and silver medallions and other decorations (right) A belt and bracelet from the burial. Artifacts found have led experts to link the people with Persia, thousands of miles to the south . An iron combat knife, silver medallion and a bronze bird figurine was found by one of the adult mummies and are understood to date from the seventh to the ninth centuries. It is thought the preservation of the bodies was 'an accident' caused by a combination of the copper, which prevented oxidation of the remains, and a dip in temperatures in the centuries after the group were buried. Natalia Fyodorova, of the Urals branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said: 'Nowhere in the world are there so many mummified remains found outside the permafrost or the marshes. The group, buried around 800 years ago, are thought to have been mummified 'by accident' due to the copper plating placed around their bodies . A belt buckle from the burial, which experts are continuing to investigate . 'It is a unique archaeological site. We are pioneers in everything from taking away the object of sandy soil (which has not been done previously) and ending with the possibility of further research.' She suggested that the smashing of the skulls may have been done soon after death 'to render protection from mysterious spells believed to emanate from the deceased'. In 2002, archeologists were forced to halt work at the site due to objections by locals on the Yamal peninsula, a land of reindeer and energy riches known to locals as 'the end of the earth'. The experts were disturbing the souls of their ancestors, they feared. Work is underway now to solve this riddle, including a genetic study of the remains headed by Alexander Pilipenko, research fellow of Institute of Cytology and Genetics, part of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.","Archeologists unearth mysterious tribe of people south of the Arctic Circle .

'I'm going into this fight with momentum and on the back of four wins. 'It's the biggest fight out there for me, why would I not want it? Of course it's the toughest fight out there. I'm the only one who can give him a challenge. 'When I turned professional I said I wanted to fight the best and see where I ended up and that's what I've done.

"Sedbergh’s goal-kicking full-back Johnny McPhillips has fired the Cumbrian team to the top of the Daily Mail Schools Trophy. McPhillips landed a last-ditch, long-distance penalty to seal Sedbergh’s 37-34 win over arch-rivals Wellington on Tuesday at the Broadstreet club in Coventry. A memorable match between two of English rugby’s top school teams saw Sedbergh’ s stronger forwards keep Wellington’s speedy backs just at bay. Sedbergh stormed to a 37-34 win over arch-rivals Wellington on Tuesday at the Broadstreet club in Coventry . Wellington, who had led the table previously, needed the pace of wing Sam Aspland-Robinson who contributed three tries to keep them in sight of the strong Cumbrians whose lock Alex Moon scored two tries. Robinson’s third try levelled the scores at 34-34 only for McPhillips, who had already landed one long-distance kick, to smartly add a second for a three-point advantage. Even then, in the final moments, Wellington earned a chance to level through a penalty, but they choose to kick for the corner in an attempt to score a winning try off a line-out move. Sedbergh have overtaken previous leaders Wellington at the summit of the Daily Mails Schools Trophy . ‘The boys wanted to win,’ explained Wellington coach Kevin Brennan. ‘In hindsight maybe we should have gone for goal, but we wanted to win.’ Overall, Wellington accepted Sedbergh were the better team on the night, but the Trophy, organised on a merit-table basis by schoolsrugby.co.uk, is far from settled.

"Scobee. Josh Scobee. That’s how the Jacksonville Jaguars kicker might introduce himself to a beautiful blonde or buxom brunette at a roulette table. Although the 32-year-old probably wouldn’t win any James Bond lookalike contests on his own, Scobee might have a shot if he pulled up in his ride. The Aston Martin DBS he drives is similar to the one 007 drove in Casino Royale. In addition to driving like Bond, Scobee is also cool under pressure. Josh Scobee (right) met Fulham's Scott Parker at a training session on Monday . Scobee (No 10) is congratulated by center Jacques McClendon (66) after kicking a field goal against Miami . The Jaguars all-time leading scorer with 984 points, Scobee has kicked seven-game winning field goals during his career - including a 59-yard blast to defeat the Indianapolis Colts in 2010. As anyone who watched the last NFL game in London between the Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions can attest, the difference between winning and losing can all come down to one kick, a reality that Scobee is certainly aware, but not afraid, of. The 11-year pro played at Wembley last season during Jacksonville’s 42-10 loss to the San Francisco 49ers and he’s more than ready for the international stage once again. He said: ‘It looks a little slippery but that’s how it was last year. We know what to expect. The Cowboys haven’t played here yet. They’ll find out it’s something different that they’ll have to adjust to.’ ‘The footing is going to be different and the elements are different but at the same it’s just snap, hold and kick. We’re doing the same thing, just in a different place.’ ‘You have to be focused and take each kick individually. Go into it with the same mindset and confidence level whether you’ve missed the last one or made the last one.’ Like James Bond, Scobee is the proud owner of an Aston Martin DB9 . Scobee is one of the NFL's most consistent kickers . Scobee has every reason to be confident. He’s made 225 of 279 field goals in his career (80.64 percent) and hit on 23 of 25 attempts (92 per cent) last season. That sort of reliability has made him somewhat of an anchor, albeit an unlikely one, for Jacksonville’s young special teams unit. However, instead of calling himself a leader, Scobee simply refers to himself as the ‘oldest’. He said: ‘Unfortunately the kicker isn’t always looked at that way. I try to be that person and be responsible for special teams.’ His role as an elder statesman has also made him responsible for advising the younger players about what to do in London, or more specifically, what not to do: ‘Don’t go in strange places around the city where people might not like Americans.’ Despite that advice, Scobee hasn’t had any issues. ‘I’ve been in the city walking around and enjoying the random things in London. We don’t have a lot of this stuff in Jacksonville – all the old traditions.’ ‘Meeting people is a lot of fun. The different ways that people talk and the slang they use. You find yourself using a British accent after a little while, or at least trying to. It’s a lot of fun.’ Scobee has also had time for sightseeing. Given his secret agent sensibilities, the destinations have been somewhat predictable. ‘I went to an Aston Martin dealership. Then I went to the London Film Museum and saw all of the Bond cars. That was pretty cool. My favourite was the DB5 from Skyfall. I have a picture of it on my phone somewhere.’ It’s unclear whether the phone he was referring to was supplied by Q.","Josh Scobee has played in the NFL for 11 years and kicked at Wembley last season .

"Tim Sherwood has suggested Tottenham may be regretting letting him go last season by insisting the struggling north London club would 'take his win percentage now'. Mauricio Pochettino replaced the 45-year-old in May but has won just 33 per cent of his Premier League games, with Spurs languishing in 12th place. And Sherwood, whose ratio of 59 per cent is the highest of any manager in the club's history, has criticised how the Argentine manager has started at White Hart Lane.

'I reckon Spurs would take my win percentage now,' Sherwood told The Sun. Several of Tottenham's youngsters, namely Harry Kane and Ryan Mason, have impressed this season and Sherwood believes the club must stick with the academy talent. He also somewhat takes credit for Kane's emergence, with the England Under 21 striker scoring nine goals so far this season. 'Finding young talent and recruiting them is one thing but it's then about being brave and giving them the opportunity. Harry Kane is a good example. I threw him into the team and he scored goals.

"Ali Carter made his return to big-time snooker on Friday but it was Neil Robertson who advanced to the semi-finals of the Champion of Champions in Coventry. Carter received a standing ovation from the crowd as he made his comeback after being diagnosed with lung cancer in May, pushing his body through punishing sessions of chemotherapy and major surgery. Despite the cheers from the audience, he was unable to make a winning return against Robertson who won their encounter 4-0 and went on to beat Ricky Walden 6-3 in the Group 3 final. Ali Carter received a standing ovation as he made his return to big-time snooker in Coventry on Friday . Carter told ITV4 afterwards: 'It was the right result really, Neil was always going to be a a tough opponent. 'Having chemo was like going to hell and back... but I refused to die at 34.' Read Jonathan McEvory's interview HERE . 'I got a great reception and have had great support from World Snooker and all the players. Today was all about being here and getting it out of the way. 'I left my suit at home...forgetting it did me a favour because I was worried about looking a right state out there, which took my focus off the occasion. 'I didn't feel comfortable in the first couple of frames but after that I thought I could play well.' On his health situation, Carter added: 'I decided to have an operation to burn away the remaining part of the tumour and that has done the job - but it took me a long time to recover, the mental effects catch up with you. 'I've got the all clear but it's only month by month and they keep you under close surveillance for the first year. I'm up all night and can't seem to relax - it's a difficult time at the moment.' Carter, who will play his first full ranking event in this month's UK Championship, was grateful his ranking was frozen by World Snooker. Despite the cheers from the crowd, Carter was unable to make a winning return against Neil Robertson . He added: 'I've got a bit of catching up to do - but I'm not worried about that. 'When I was diagnosed I thought I was going to die, snooker was so far from my mind then. But I'm looking forward to getting back to my best.' Walden had also enjoyed a 4-0 win against Mark Allen to progress in the afternoon but Robertson had too much for him in the evening session. The Chester potter had led 3-2 but Robertson got it level and the momentum switched as the seventh frame went to the black and Walden went in off to hand it to the Australian. Robertson then claimed the final two frames to set up a semi-final against Judd Trump. 'The match started off very well, both players looked in really good form carrying over from our earlier matches,' he said. 'The match got a little bit scrappy in the sixth or seventh frame. Maybe Ricky just showing a few signs of tiredness after his big win in China last week.'","Ali Carter was given a standing ovation as he returned to snooker .

"Celtic have opened talks with Scotland captain Scott Brown over an extended contract that could eventually see him take on a player/coach role at Parkhead. Brown’s existing deal expires at the end of the season, by which point he will be just a few weeks short of his 30th birthday. The club have an option to extend the contract by a year but discussions have commenced with a view to securing a longer stay for the midfielder, who is set to skipper Scotland in the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park on Friday night. Brown joined Celtic from Hibernian in 2007 for £4.4 million in what stands as a record transfer between Scottish clubs. He has been a mainstay for club and country ever since and his absence from Celtic’s early-season fixtures was seen within the club as a huge factor in the club’s failure to qualify for the Champions League. Scott Brown (left), pictured in action against FC Astra, is in talks over a new contract with Celtic . Brown is working towards his B license and could become a player-coach as part of his new deal . Brown has made no secret of his wish to end his playing days in Glasgow and last summer he enlisted with the SFA’s coaching course at Largs in an attempt to secure his B license. Celtic have been fully supportive of Brown’s coaching bid, so much so that he was in the dug-out alongside under-20s coach Stevie Frail for a recent SPFL Development League fixture against Hearts. Manager Ronny Deila has spoken positively of Brown’s wish to eventually move into management and the new terms will be constructed towards an eventual move towards some coaching duties at the club. A similar combined deal has been in the pipeline for Brown’s team-mate Kris Commons but talks have stalled, with former Celtic boss Neil Lennon said to be interested in taking last season’s player of the year to Bolton Wanderers in January.

"Tottenham defender Eric Dier has defended his decision to opt out of the England Under-21 squad and insisted he has not snubbed his country. Dier decided to make himself unavailable for selection for the friendlies against Portugal and France in order to spend more time settling in with his club, having moved to White Hart Lane from Sporting Lisbon in August. The 20-year-old has lost his place in the starting line-up at the London club and England Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate agreed that Dier would be better served spending time on the training ground at Tottenham. Eric Dier scored in his first two Premier League games, pictured (centre) celebrating against QPR . Dier has represented England at Under 18, 19, 20 and 21 levels during his career so far . 'I spoke to Gareth Southgate and we were in complete agreement that it was the right thing to do,' Dier told the club's official website. 'We had an open conversation and I think he was happy that I could be so honest with him. If he wasn't completely fine with this then I would never have asked because I would never want to put him in a difficult position. 'He has been fantastic with the whole situation and is really easy to talk to. I certainly would never want to give him or anyone else the wrong impression. Dier has made 13 appearances for Tottenham since arriving from Sporting Lisbon in the summer . Dier pictured scoring on his Tottenham and Premier League debut against West Ham in August 2014 . 'It is not a case that I don't want to play for England, that couldn't be further from the truth. 'It has been a hectic start to the season for me and I have been delighted with the number of games I've played so far. 'Obviously, I have just moved clubs and even though I represent England I have not lived here since I was really young so I am still adapting to my new environment. 'I just felt that this two-week period gives me the opportunity to work on parts of my game that I have had problems with over the past two months, personal elements I need to work on both physically and on the football pitch that I think will make me a better player for both club and country in the long term. 'It is far from a rest. This is a period where I can spend time at my new club and put a lot of work in to improve because during the season these opportunities do not come around too often for Spurs or England because of the number of games we have to prepare for.' Dier also denied that he is not happy with being employed at right-back rather than centre-half. 'I will never complain to a manager about what position I play as long as I am playing - I'd even play centre-forward if I was asked to,' he added.","Eric Dier asked coach Gareth Southgate to withdraw him from U21 squad .

The All Blacks extended their dominance over Stuart Lancaster's men to a fifth successive victory after prevailing 24-21 at Twickenham on Saturday.

"Rangers midfielder Lewis Macleod is determined to take all he can from his first experience in the full Scotland squad. The 20-year-old will spend the week training with Gordon Strachan's men ahead of their European Championship qualifier against the Republic of Ireland on Friday night and the friendly with England the following Tuesday. Macleod further enhanced his reputation with his eighth goal of the season on Saturday, heading home the second goal in a 4-0 Scottish Championship win over Falkirk after meeting Jon Daly's cross on the counter-attack. Rangers star Lewis MacLeod (centre) celebrates his goal during the 4-0 league win over Falkirk . He also set up the third for Kenny Miller with a low cross to the far post as Rangers remained four points behind leaders Hearts. His passing ability also helped Rangers put Falkirk on the back foot ahead of Nicky Law's 25th-minute opener, when the former Motherwell man forced the ball home after the visitors struggled to clear a corner. Macleod had sent Miller away to set up a break by drilling a 60-yard pass just inside the left touchline, and then arrived in the attack to thread a defence-splitting ball to the veteran forward, who saw his shot turned wide. Macleod poses with the Saltire after being called up for Scotland to face Republic of Ireland and England . Macleod has already featured for Scotland at Under 21 level as he takes on the Slovakia defence in September . It is such creativity that has earned him a place in the Scotland squad as Strachan continues to involve the country's promising young players. Hull left-back Andy Robertson utilised his chance to force his way into Strachan's regular plans, and although Macleod has a tougher position to break into, he aims to make sure he gives himself every chance. 'I don't expect to play but it will be a great experience training and you couldn't get two bigger games to be involved in,' Macleod said. 'If I get any game time at all I'll be more than happy. 'It's a massive step. It was a big step playing with the 21s and it will be hard but I'm looking forward to it. It can only benefit me.' The 20-year-old is a fast rising star and has been named October's SPFL young player of the month, thanks to performances such as at Livingston when he opened the scoring with an acrobatic effort . The likes of Miller and Kris Boyd have given Macleod some advice ahead of his first involvement. 'They have just told me to take it all in and enjoy every minute of it because, you never know, it could be your last time but hopefully it will be the first of many times,' said the midfielder. Macleod secured another accolade this weekend after helping Rangers win their eighth consecutive game when he was named SPFL young player of the month. 'It's been a great month and the team has played a lot better,' he said. 'The call-up came as a big surprise and I'm delighted with the award too.'","Lewis Macleod doesn't expect to play for Scotland after first-team call-up .

"Football Federation Australia (FFA) chairman Frank Lowy says his country conducted a clean bid for the World Cup and has rejected assertions to the contrary arising from a FIFA Ethics Committee report. A summary report by FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert into alleged corruption in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding - won by Russia and Qatar respectively - found fault with the losing bids rather than the successful ones. The report said there were 'potentially problematic facts and circumstances' surrounding England's bid for 2018, while the 2022 bid teams of Australia, Japan and South Korea were rebuked for their conduct. Frank Lowy (L) said Australia ran clean campaign despite Hans-Joachim Eckert's (R) report finding otherwise . Eckert's (right) report was a summary of Michael Garcia's (left) larger report into the bidding process . Eckert did rule none of the actions of the bidding nations affected the integrity of the vote. Lowy issued a statement on Friday saying Australia's bid was conducted with government oversight, reviewed by independent external auditors, and involved input from FIFA. 'I made it clear to all involved in our bid that we would run a clean campaign and I stressed this objective at every opportunity,' Lowy said. 'FFA did its best to run a competitive and compliant bid.' Blatter has served four terms as FIFA president and is set to stand for a fifth next year . The 42-page report released by Eckert summarised a larger report by American attorney Michael Garcia into the bidding process. Garcia, a former New York federal prosecutor, subsequently condemned the summary as 'materially incomplete and erroneous'. The summarised report found fault with the conduct of eight out of nine bidders for the two tournaments and made out a 'prima facie case' that Australian consultants violated ethics in their World Cup bid. It referred to the 'potentially problematic conduct of specific individuals' and said FFA was 'well aware' of the conduct. Sepp Blatter (right) hands the World Cup to Qatar’s Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani . FFA was found to have made 'certain payments' to the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) which appeared to be blended with the personal funds of the CONCACAF president. Lowy said the bid team was misled about payments to CONCACAF 'which was later revealed to have been misappropriated.' 'In hindsight, there are many things we might have done differently and we remain disappointed by our experience of the World Cup bidding process,' Lowy said.","Report by FIFA ethics judge found fault with Australia's losing 2022 bid .

"Luis Suarez has revealed he is receiving psychological help in a bid to overcome the problems that have seen him suspended twice in 15 months for biting opposition players. The Uruguay international's most recent offence occurred during the World Cup, where he was caught sinking his teeth into Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder. That incident saw him handed a four-month suspension from all football, after he had been banned for 10 games for doing the same thing to Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in a Premier League match against Chelsea in April 2013. VIDEO scroll down for Luis Suarez: I'll be smarter on the pitch after controversies . Luis Suarez caused huge controversy at the World Cup in June after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini . The controversial forward was banned for 10 games in April 2013 for this bite on Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic . Suarez was labelled 'fat' by some sections of the press prior to his Barcelona debut against Real Madrid . Now a Barca player following his £75million summer move from Liverpool, the 27-year-old is keen to prove that he is a changed man by talking about the steps he has taken to banish his disciplinary problems once and for all. He told El Observador: 'After the suspension I had some really hard times. I'm getting psychological help and the club have been a constant support.' As he moved ever closer to his return to football against Real Madrid on October 25, Suarez was also accused of being fat by sections of the press, but he has now spoken out against those who questioned his fitness. Suarez scored against Costa Rica, but Uruguay were denied by a late equaliser and then in a shootout . The £75m Barcelona forward equalised for Uruguay, but his side drew 3-3 and then lost 7-6 on penalties . 'I was never overweight. It was just as Luis Enrique said on one occasion: ""Tell me when you see Luis Suárez thin"". 'The doctor who carries out the medicals at the club said that I was one of the six players at Barcelona who had the lowest percentage of fat and lowest weight. It was all part of the newspapers' game.' His inability to control his temper has seemingly been the factor behind Suarez's omission from the list of candidates for this year's Ballon d'Or, but rather than protest against the snub, the former Ajax man is remaining philosophical, while targeting his first league goals for his new club. Suarez is yet to open his account for new side Barcelona after making four appearances so far . The former Liverpool striker shakes hands with old boss Kenny Dalglish after winning the Golden Shoe . 'I'm sure I haven't been nominated because of what I did at the World Cup,' he added. 'But in that case, they should take into account all those who did nothing at the World Cup. 'It hurts you, because I did a lot of things at Liverpool last year. But in football there's always another chance. It'll come. 'I'm not worried. If I don't score goals and we win, I'll be happy all the same.

"Real Madrid have sent their English Galactico groundsman Paul Burgess to sort out the pitches they will have to play on during the Club World Cup after serious concerns that their players would be risking injury on sub-standard surfaces. Madrid are due to fly out to Morocco on December 14 for the seven-team tournament that could see them win their fourth trophy of the year but there are real concerns that their season will be derailed by serious injury to top players because of the state of the pitch at Rabat where they play their semi-final on December 16 against the winner of Cruz Azul from Mexico and Western Sydney Wanderers. Real ‘signed’ Burgess from Arsenal in 2009 after he had excelled in the Premier League and Madrid saw him as the cure for on-going problems with their own Santiago Bernabeu pitch. Real Madrid are concerned their players could pick up injuries playing on poor quality pitches . He has produced the perfect playing surface in Madrid for Manuel Pellegrini, Jose Mourinho and now Carlo Ancelotti but he also inspects the pitches Madrid have to play on beyond Spanish borders. Burgess visited the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium which is home to FAR Rabat at the end of October and returned and was not impressed with what he saw. The venue will host the first three matches of the tournament and then Madrid’s semi-final. Burgess is over-seeing urgent repair work on the playing surface which Real’s potential rivals in the World Club Cup final, San Lorenzo, will not have to play on because they play their semi-final in Marrakech where the final will also be held. Burgess was responsible for the immaculate pitch at Highbury before moving to Spain to join Real Madrid . On Burgess’ advice Madrid have asked Fifa to allow them to arrive just two days before they play their first game in Morocco enabling them to fit another training session in at their own Valdebebas training ground and not in Rabat. It is not unusual for Burgess to inspect conditions before Real Madrid have to play – he also flies to the United States ahead of pre-season tours to check facilities and pitch standards. The three-times winner of the Premier League Groundsman of the year award at Arsenal joined the Gunners in 1996 as an 18-year-old after starting his career at Blackpool. He took over as head groundsman of Arsenal’s former home Highbury four years later before Madrid swooped in 2009.

"Greig Laidlaw illustrated the magnitude of the task that lies ahead for Scotland against the All Blacks on Saturday when he compared it to facing Roger Federer in his pomp. A contest against the world champions at BT Murrayfield inevitably has a flavour of the David and Goliath about it. Scotland after all have never beaten the All Blacks - two draws over the generations is all we can muster. Yet there is a mood of optimism in the Scotland camp this week - buoyed as the players are by their sparkling performance in the 41-31 win over Argentina at the weekend. Greig Laidlaw (right) compared playing New Zealand to facing Roger Federer at tennis . Laidlaw (right) said Scotlant have to show grit and determination against the All Blacks . And there was a steely determination about Laidlaw yesterday as he talked passionately about his desire to go down in history as the first Scotland skipper to lead his nation to a win over the mighty All Blacks. ‘We aren’t going to die wondering,’ said Laidlaw. ‘We are going to chuck the ball about when it is on, tighten up when we have to. We are going to try and play the Scottish way. It’s about grit and determination first and foremost and getting stuck in. If we do that and set our stall out we give ourselves a good chance. ‘For us this game I suppose is like playing Roger Federer at tennis. It is taking on the best team, the best competitors the sport has. The All Blacks have shown that over a number of years. They have consistently been the best team in the world. Alasdair Dickinson (left) of Scotland is tackled by Argentina's Thomas Lavanini during Saturday's match . ‘That is a credit to them and their values and the way they play their game. When they play in the black jersey they are an incredible outfit. When we go out to face them on Saturday it will be the ultimate test for the players and the ultimate test for us as a Scotland team. We can’t go out there as individuals. We need to be collective and fight for each other.’ The 29-year-old Laidlaw has been on the receiving end of two heavy home defeats at the hands of the All Blacks, making his debut off the bench in a 49-3 defeat in 2010 and starting in the 51-22 mauling two years later. The one big lesson learned from both games was the need to keep the All Blacks on a tight leash early on or risk the game being lost before it has really begun. ‘That seems to be the pattern for many of their games, which is why we need to try and start well,’ Laidlaw said. ‘We need to stay in the game for 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 and feel our way through the game. Stuart Hogg scores a try during the Autumn International Test match against Argentina . Hogg wildly celebrates his try as Scotland ran out 41-31 winners against Argentina . ‘We need to play with ball in hand as much as we can because if we have the ball it is easier to play the game rather than us trying to chase it down and defending. You get a lot more tired defending so we need to stay competitive and taking the game to them. ‘I think we lost 13 tries in the two games I played against them so we have to drastically reduce that number if we are going to come anywhere near them.’ The victory over Argentina last weekend, or at least the first 60 minutes of the match when Scotland dominated and led 34-10, has given Laidlaw confidence that history can be written on Saturday. ‘You have to think we can go out there and win and be part of the first Scotland team to beat New Zealand,’ he said. ‘We all know the challenge we face and if we are going to . Tommy Seymour  celebrates scoring a late try in the second half and is congratulated by Hogg and Duncan Weir . get anywhere near them we need an 80 minute performance that’s for sure. ‘The fact we won that Argentina game was great for us but because we let in a couple of tries near the end means we still have our feet firmly on the ground. We are not getting carried away. ‘We need to be very disciplined this weekend and not get the yellow cards we picked up against Argentina. To get even close to New Zealand we need to keep 15 men on the field.’ Although Laidlaw is only Scotland captain on a game-by-game basis with first-choice skipper Grant Gilchrist being ruled out with a broken arm, he has gained the trust of head coach, and New Zealander, Vern Cotter. Laidlaw (left) runs with the ball during Scotland's win over Argentina on Saturday . Laidlaw believes that inside knowledge of All Blacks rugby will give the Scotland players a vital insight into how to approach the game mentally. ‘Obviously Vern has a strong Kiwi background which is good for us,’ he continued. ‘He hasn’t really been involved in the All Blacks set up, but he’s from New Zealand, he knows what they are all about, he knows the cultures and the way that they like to play the game and what goes through their minds. ‘That has been good for us, me especially, because I have been speaking to Vern to get an understanding as to what they are all about. ‘It’s clear to see the All Blacks have a great attitude every time they play the game. In close games they always seem to come out on top and that is not just not by coincidence. They are strong mentally and maybe Vern can give us an insight into the New Zealand way of thinking. ‘Easy is one word we won’t be using this week but it would be fantastic to win and we are going out there with that in mind. We know we need to play with pride and passion but whatever happens we are really going to give it a shot.’ Tommy Seymour dives in to score a try during the Test win over Argentina on Saturday .","Scotland take on New Zealand at BT Murrayfield on Saturday .

"After missing the win over England, the world’s leading fly-half Dan Carter is expected to return to the All Black controls against Scotland at BT Murrayfield this weekend. The New Zealand camp were tight-lipped on their team, to be announced on Thursday but, while some leading names are expected to be rested, the man who took over the ‘No 1-No 10’ tag from Jonny Wilkinson is in line to continue his recovery from a leg fracture. Having made it clear that he would not divulge the team early, backs coach Ian Foster was then asked how he would like Carter to play against Scotland. All Blacks star Dan Carter could make his comeback against Scotland at BT Murrayfield this weekend . Carter carries the ball in training while his team-mates close him down during session in Edinburgh . Carter watches on as team-mate Charlie Faumuina receives attention from physio Peter Gallagher . Smiling, he replied: ‘I guess you are asking me what I want our 10 (stand-off) to do on Saturday … regardless of who plays. ‘I think we’ve stated before that we are keen for Dan to get significant game time on this tour so, whether he’s starting or off the bench he’s likely to be there in some form, but for him he’s got to just carry on doing what he’s doing. ‘He took some good steps in Chicago and I think he got a lot of confidence out of getting back on the park and getting used to the systems. It [the Scotland game] is clearly going to be a pretty significant step-up from that so it’s just getting timing, getting used to the speed of the defence coming at you and still getting your focus to give yourself a chance to make the right decisions. Those are the little things that just come from time in the saddle. ‘It’s not easy – it doesn’t matter how many Tests you have played – to come back in after a break and perform, and so I guess both Dan and Sonny Bill Williams have been asking lots of questions. ‘But mainly it is just getting them feeling the way the team is flowing and getting their involvement in that. I think we’ve been able to speed up the process, largely because of their attitude and their desire to get it right.’ Foster, whose playing career spanned the amateur and pro eras at Waikato and the Chiefs, leads on the All Blacks attack and he admitted that he was impressed with what he saw from Scotland in their five-try, 41-31 win over Argentina on Saturday - especially the way in which the core of Glasgow players had carried their club form into the Test arena. Carter took part in a kicking practice session at Twickenham Stadium at the end of last week . The 32-year-old brought on water for his team-mates during New Zealand's win against England . ‘I think they certainly showed the benefits of that combination,’ he said of the virtually all-Warriors back line. ‘It doesn’t always work out like that when you transition from club to internationals, so clearly they’ve done a good job in how they prepared their group last week and they’ll be pleased with the result. ‘They showed a desire to play and are obviously feeling pretty good about that, so I guess what it has done is raised the bar a little bit with us about the challenges which will come on Saturday.’ While Foster is acutely aware of the skills at his disposal Ben Smith, one of his most astute and versatile backs, is still to catch up on Scotland’s game against the Pumas. Still, the Otago utility man is excited about the Scots’ style of rugby. ‘I think it’s good that they’re wanting to play expansively, and move the ball when they can,’ he said. ‘That’s the good thing about rugby, I think, that that kind of play gets rewarded, so it’s good to see that Scotland have embraced that kind of rugby and I’m sure it will make for good entertainment on Saturday. ‘There are some quality players throughout their back line. [Stuart] Hogg the full-back is a very dangerous runner and the likes of [Sean] Maitland and their back three are pretty dangerous, so they’re not unknown at all. The guys have a good amount of respect for this Scotland team and we know we’ll have to be on our game this weekend.’ Pushed on whether complacency might creep in when facing a team they have never lost to, Smith added: ‘We’re not complacent at all - we have a big challenge ahead of us. ‘We’ve looked at the game against England and how we can improve and I’m sure as we go through the week we’ll have a good look at Scotland. But we know that they are a team that likes to play expansive rugby; they’re a dangerous team. ‘They are definitely a team that is improving on the international stage … and if they’re going to get better it’s through playing the kind of rugby that they are. They’ve got a good coach and so, yes, we’ve got to prepare really well because it’s going to be a big battle come Saturday.’","New Zealand ace Dan Carter is expected to start at Murrayfield .

"Sing up, Chelsea fans. You've never had it so good. That's essentially what Jose Mourinho was intimating to the Blues faithful when he complained about the noise levels at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. As Mourinho's side maintained their unbeaten start to the season against west London rivals QPR, no less, the atmosphere at the Bridge was tepid, to say the least. Chelsea fans will argue that the Shed End is always rocking when the big boys come to town, but shouldn't it be every week? Here, MailOnline Sport lists 10 reasons why Chelsea fans should crank up the volume... Jose Mourinho takes his place in the Chelsea dugout ahead of his side's 2-1 win over QPR on Saturday . 1) 'Jose Mourinho' As the song goes... After years of hiring and firing, Roman Abramovich finally came to his senses last year, made up with the Special One, flung open the Stamford Bridge gates and sparked a nostalgic Chelsea love-in. A year or so on and that honeymoon period seems to be over. He may just be plain old Jose again but the enigmatic Portuguese is beginning to flex his managerial muscles after an ultimately disappointing first season back. Oh, and he's not Rafa Benitez. 2) It's just like watching Brazil . Well, not the Brazil we saw crumble at the last World Cup, but Chelsea's football this season has been sublime at times. The hallmarks of Mourinho's first Chelsea side, who won back-to-back titles in 2005 and 2006, were organisation and relentless consistency. But Jose's Chelsea Mark II have been slick and quick. Enough to make you stand up and sing, you'd think. Eden Hazard celebrates scoring what would prove to be the winner from the penalty spot against QPR . Cesc Fabregas has been a revelation in midfield since joining from Barcelona in the summer . 3) Champions elect . On the evidence of the first 10 games of the season you'd be mad to back anyone other than Chelsea for the title. Manchester City and Arsenal are dropping points left, right and centre, Liverpool are a shadow of the side that came so close to glory last year and Manchester United are even worse off at this stage of the season under Louis van Gaal than they were under David Moyes 12 months ago. 4) Drogba is back . In a decade of unprecedented success Didier Drogba was the man who got the goals that won the trophies for Chelsea. Who could forget that night in Munich? And those Wembley heroics? But after a hero's welcome back in the summer, Drogba has quickly been forgotten about. Yes, he's not had many minutes, but he was never going to at his age. The feelgood factor Drogba's return brought with him has died down alarmingly quickly. The hype surrounding Didier Drogba's return to Stamford Bridge has quickly dissipated . 5) That midfield . It cost Chelsea over £70million to unite Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar in the middle of the park but it's already looking like a snip. Aged 27, 26 and 23 respectively, the trio should have several years together to work on what is already a seamless combination of steel, energy and style. Chuck in Eden Hazard and Willian or Andre Schurrle on the wings and you've got enough to make most football fans audibly purr. 6) Deadly Diego . Perceived wisdom has it that Chelsea would have won the title last year with a decent striker in their side, and they probably will do this time around thanks to one that's more than decent. Diego Costa is the sort of striker fans love: full of passion, wild celebrations and, most importantly, goals. There are 19 other Premier League clubs that would love to have him in their side, but poor Diego hasn't even got a song at Chelsea yet... Diego Costa is the striker Chelsea had been craving since Drogba's first spell at the club ended . Costa celebrates Chelsea's winner on Saturday with Belgian winger Hazard . VIDEO Costa needs care - Mourinho . 7) Kings of Europe? Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are the teams to beat in Europe this season but Chelsea look the most capable of any side in the Champions League of doing just that. This is arguably the best starting line-up and squad the Blues have ever had to combine a Premier League title challenge with an assault on Europe. They're certainly the best-equipped English side to triumph in Europe. 8) Roman's Empire . Eleven years on and for all his mystery, Roman Abramovich appears to still have all the same enthusiasm for his plaything as he did when he first bought the club from Ken Bates. Remember him, anyone? Mourinho gesticulates to his players during Saturday's win as Chelsea fans look on . 9) Home comforts . Abramovich has been exploring options to expand or move from Stamford Bridge over the past decade, but at least it has four stands and, well, works. Those Blues who have been around longer than the Abramovich era will remember Stamford Bridge with a dirt track around it, cars parked just yards from the pitch and a stand with no roof. Here's how Stamford Bridge's terraced Shed End looked in 1994 before being redeveloped . 10) You've never had it so good . Many a Chelsea fan will only know success. The last 10 years have been laden with it: three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups, one Champions League and one Europa League. Not bad. But it was once all so different. Chelsea were relegated to the old Second Division in 1988, and until Abramovich bought the club, their highest Premier League finish was third in 1999. Time to shake off those Stamford Bridge blues. There's plenty to sing about after all.","Jose Mourinho slammed Chelsea fans for being too quiet on Saturday .

"Liverpool striker Divock Origi and Everton forward Romelu Lukaku came off the bench to score in the second half in Brussels. Nicolas Lombaerts put the home side ahead in the 12th minute when he headed home Adnan Januzaj's free kick but the defender was at fault a minute later when he left Alfred Finnbogason to force the ball home at the far post. Origi, on a season-long loan to French side Lille, let fly with a 25-yard drive to put Belgium 2-1 up in the 62nd minute and Lukaku sealed victory in the friendly match with a tap in. Belgium's Divock Origi, second left, scores the second goal against Iceland on Wednesday night . Belgium: Courtois, Vanden Borre, Alderweireld, Lombaerts, Vertonghen, Witsel, Dembele (Lukaku 46), Fellaini, Januzaj (Mertens 63), Hazard (Origi 46), Benteke (Praet 76). Subs Not Used: Mignolet, De Bruyne, Meunier, Nainggolan, De Bock, Chadli, Denayer, Gillet. Goals: Lombaerts 12,Origi 62,Lukaku 73.

Subs Not Used: Halldorsson, Sigthorsson, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Arnason, Olafur Ingi Skulason, Theodor Elmar Bjarnason. Goal: Finnbogason 13. Ref: Antony Gautier (France). The result ended the visitors' five-match unbeaten run. Belgium had the lion's share of possession but Iceland repeatedly showed themselves to be dangerous on the counter and could have gone into half-time ahead were it not for a couple of decent saves from Belgium's Thibaut Courtois. Belgium's 12th minute opener came directly from the training ground as Lombaerts charged forward and deftly headed Januzaj's free kick into the net. But the hosts, missing injured captain and central defender Vincent Kompany, held on for little more than a minute before Iceland's Finnbogason found himself unmarked at the back post from a corner for an easy tap-in . Substitute Origi re-established Belgium's lead in the 62nd minute, feigning right, then cutting inside to blast home with his left beyond Iceland's Ingvar Jonsson. Shortly afterwards, Club Bruges' Thomas Meunier opened up Iceland's defence, before passing to Dries Mertens who fed Lukaku in front of an open net to settle the encounter. Iceland had won their three opening Euro 2016 qualifiers, including a 2-0 victory over the Netherlands a month ago, to top group A on goal difference from the Czech Republic, who they visit on Sunday. Belgium will on the same day host Group B leaders Wales, the last side to beat Iceland, in a friendly in March. Belgium will be heartened by the fine form of Courtois and the return of Christian Benteke, playing his first match since March. The striker, currently serving a three-match Premier League ban, delivered what Belgium have lacked in his absence, a man to hold the ball up front.

"Chelsea midfielder Oscar says Cesc Fabregas has lifted Chelsea up to a new level this term with his contribution. Chelsea are currently top of the Premier League and Fabregas has nine assists, one for Oscar's fine goal in the 2-1 win over QPR on Saturday. The Brazilian is grateful to the Spaniard for his service, but insists it's not just the former Arsenal star's assists that have improved the Blues midfield.

'I donâ€™t know if it is my best goal - I need to see it again - but it was a nice goal. 'But Cesc helps the team so much and not just with the assists. In a game, he helps everyone, with beautiful passes like the one for me in this game. 'He has come in this year and played so well and I like playing together with him.

"Danny Ings' double on his home ground led England to an impressive 3-1 win over Portugal at Turf Moor. The Burnley striker scored in the sixth minute and then again in the second half, while Carl Jenkinson also got on the scoresheet for England. Relive all the action as it happened below. Host commentator . A very good night at the office for England and they head to France for their next game on Monday night. That's all from me... see you soon! A job very well done by England. They have played some really good football and scored three quality goals. It's a morale boosting win against the team who they will face in their Euro 2015 opener in Czech Republic in June. Portugal played some good football as well, but their defending let them down. But also they look to be holding back a bit and not revealing their hand to England with that game in June to come. England have now won 11 in a row and will head to France for a friendly in Brest on Monday after inflicting Portugal's first defeat in 15. Three added minutes at Turf Moor. Nathan Redmond is announced as man of the match with two minutes to play plus injury time. It was a close call between him and Ings, who scored twice. I probably would have given it to Redmond as well. Not long left now and there's a party atmosphere in the crowd. A standing ovation for Danny Ings as he is replaced with 11 minutes to play. The night couldn't have gone much better for him - two goals on home soil. Bamford is the man to replace him while Robinson also comes on for Garbutt. England almost home here, but need to keep their concentration. A good night's work for Redmond comes to an end as he is replaced by Alex Pritchard with 18 minutes to play. Redmond has been a problem for Portugal's defence all night. 20 minutes to go in Burnley and Portugal are the team on the front foot now. England are defending very deep and allowing their visitors to apply pressure. So far, though, Southgate's side are holding firm and still maintaining a threat on the counter attack. Ings was clean through a minute ago with a chance for his hat-trick... but he was also yards offside. A number of changes for Portugal. Chalobah came on for Hughes for England as well. Two-goal cushion restored for England. Once again Portugal were opened up very easily. Redmond did very down the left as he beat his defender and cut the ball back low for Ings to slot in from close range. England have had to do some defending at the start of the second half, but that goal should settle them. Very good response. Portugal must have had a message at half-time to start pushing on and having a go at England. In the first half they were timid in possession and often just went from side to side. In eight minutes of second-half action they have already tested England more than they did in the entire first half. England need to be a bit more cautious at the back, but there are still plenty of opportunities going forward, especially on the counter attack. Game on again in Burnley. Lovely finish from Bernardo Silva through the legs of Butland and Portugal are back in it. England look to have been caught cold there after the restart, and suddenly their lead is not so comfortable now. 45 minutes to got then and we're underway in the second half. 'More of the same please' would have been the message from Southgate in the dressing room at half-time. Half-time in Burnley and it's looking good for England at the moment. They have scored two really good goals and looked very dangerous in possession. Portugal, for all their possession, never really threatened England and have also struggled to contain the likes of Ings, Redmond and Ince. I'll be back for the second half very shortly, but here's Dom King's views on the action so far: . 'This is a big night for some of these England players. Gareth Southgate has a rough idea of what his 23-man party for the Czech Republic will be and a few of this group need to stake a claim. One man who is doing so is Tom Ince. He has been heavily involved and is taking the chance to impress the head coach. Will Hughes, too, has built on his outstanding performance in Croatia. So far it is a case of a job being very well done.' No 2 for England! Again it was lovely, intricate build-up play and Will Hughes' cut back from the left channel went all the way through to Jenkinson, who arrived into the penalty box late and slotted in England's second. An excellent finish from the young Arsenal right back and England double their advantage. Portugal very poor defensively. Hughes has the ball in the back of the net, but was offside from Ings' ball through. No arguments there, the Derby man was a couple of yards off. Much better football from England over the last few minutes. They have been the team taking the game to the opposition and looking menacing. Portugal had a lot of possession earlier but never really troubled England, but on the other hand England look dangerous whenever they come forward. Five minutes until half-time. Portugal are dominating possession at the moment and moving the ball around really well, but without testing the England back line. England's pacy attacking players like Ince and Redmond are being given plenty of space to work with due to the pattern of the game. Portugal's midfield are very narrow when they defend and there are some gaps for England to exploit. 33 minutes played - 1-0 to England. Garbutt has gotten forward from left back a couple of times and put in some dangerous crosses, the latest of which was spilled by Portugal goalkeeper Silva. Pace of the game has slowed down somewhat. England are having to work very hard without possession as Portugal are becoming more and more comfortable in possession. 20 minutes gone at Turf Moor and signs that Portugal are starting to settle into the game now. They've had some possession in midfield and come forward well once or twice. Fernandes just had a go from 20 yards, but dragged his shot wide of the far post. Sportsmail's Dom King is wrapped up warm in position at Turf Moor. Here is an update from him... 'Turf Moor felt different in the minutes before kick-off as the usual soundtrack, which features David Bowie, The Foo Fighters and Arcade Fire, was replaced by some atmospheric music. Some things here remain the same and that is Danny Ings scoring in front of the Jimmy McIlroy Stand. Ings has had to play second fiddle to Harry Kane and Saido Berahino in the qualification programme but he is taking this opportunity to show Gareth Southgate why he should go to the Czech Republic next summer.' England once again carved right through Portugal and the visitors were lucky that the offside flag went up against Ince after Redmond played him through. England's wide players having a lot of joy at the moment and Portugal need to weather this storm. England look full of pace and creativity every time they come forward. Portugal are being pushed back very deep at the moment and can't get a foot on the ball. Impressive opening 10 minutes from Southgate's side. Danny Ings! England take the lead! Perfect start for Gareth Southgate's side in Burnley and it's local boy Ings who opens the scoring in just the sixth minute. Ince did very well in the right channel to stay onside and then pick out Ings with a low cross. The Burnley striker did the rest with a clinical finish from six yards to give England the lead. Just rewards for a fast start. A purposeful run from Ings through the centre gets his home Burnley crowd excited. The striker laid the ball out to the right and then just couldn't get on the end of the return cross into the box. Bright start from England. National anthems done and dusted at Turf Moor. Burnley's own striker Danny Ings in particular looks raring to go. Portugal kick us off and we're underway. These two teams will meet in their opening Group B fixture at the Euro U21 finals in Czech Republic next summer. Alongside these two will be Italy and Sweden while Group A is made up of hosts Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark and Serbia. Gareth Southgate just told BT Sport that 'the hard work starts now'. In Portugal, they certainly will have their work cut out. This team won all 10 of their qualification matches, including both legs of the play-off against Holland in a 7-4 aggregate win. 10 minutes to go until kick-off in Burnley. Portugal starting line-up: Silva, Figueiredo, Alves, Neves, Silva, Pereira, Esgaio, Fernandes, Ruben, Bangna, Venancio. And the benches... England: Robinson, Bond, Lascelles, Chalobah, Pritchard, Bamford, Kane, Woodrow, Wilson, Bettinelli. Portugal: Fernandes, Gaspar, Oliveira, Cancelo, Vezo, Sturgeon, Teixeira. Harry Kane starts from the bench for England tonight and there is no Saido Berahino - the star of qualifying - as he is in Roy Hodgson's senior squad. England's starting XI for tonight is as follows... Butland, Jenkinson, Garbutt, Hughes, Gibson, Keane, Ince, Forster-Caskey, Ings, Carroll, Redmond. Good evening one and all, welcome to our coverage of tonight's U21 clash between England and Portugal in Burnley. This should be a good one. We have two in form teams who have both qualified for next year's European Under 21 Championship in Czech Republic and they'll meet again in their Group B opener at the finals in June. Kick-off is around 30 minutes away and team news will follow very shortly. So sit back, relax and get comfortable.","Danny Ings scores twice as England beat Portugal at Turf Moor .

"Ally McCoist has refused to become embroiled in a war of words with Donald Findlay over the Cowdenbeath chief’s claim that Rangers are a ‘new entity’. In a Sportsmail interview on Saturday, Findlay controversially insisted he no longer recognises Rangers as the same club he once served as vice-chairman. Addressing a bitterly divisive newco/oldco debate before hosting Rangers at Central Park in a rearranged Championship clash on Tuesday evening, Findlay said: ‘To me, this is a new Rangers which has to establish its own history and tradition. But it’s not the Rangers I know. To me, genuinely, it is a new entity.’ Then and now: Donald Findlay (left) as Rangers vice-chairman but he now claim the club is unrecognisable . Supported by Lord Nimmo Smith’s independent investigation into non-disclosed payments to players, Rangers dispute that view and maintain former chief executive Charles Green paid £5.5million for both the assets and the history of the Ibrox oldco post-liquidation. McCoist agreed with that view and ahead of the match said: ‘Donald Findlay is a man I respect 100 per cent. I always have done and I always will do. Like everybody else, he’s entitled to his opinion. ‘His great friend Lord Nimmo Smith thought the opposite. So there you have two different opinions. ‘My opinion would lean towards Lord Nimmo Smith’s. I’m not going to get involved in a war of words with Donald, who I have far too much respect for.’ Findlay admitted that McCoist and coach Ian Durrant are two of the only faces he still knows at Ibrox after resigning as vice-chairman in ignominious circumstances in 1999 and, in a personal viewpoint, claims something is ‘missing’ at the club. ‘I think, like a lot of fans, Donald will be disappointed at what has happened,’ added McCoist. ‘Particularly in the last 24 months. Rangers boss Ally McCoist refused to enter into a war of words with Findlay . ‘I understand that. There are a lot of fans who feel the same way, in that they feel they have lost a bit of identity, of their own relationship with the club because of what has happened.’ The Rangers boss has yet to speak to Derek Llambias, meanwhile, after a stock market announcement on Monday confirmed the appointment of Mike Ashley’s associate as a non executive Rangers director. ‘I haven’t heard anything at all,’ said McCoist. ‘I spoke to the chairman this morning when he told me about the appointment of a new director to the board. ‘That was fine, he was keeping me up to speed.’ SFA president Campbell Ogilvie revealed the governing body are poised for a sit-down with Ashley — as they seek further ‘clarification’ over his growing power at Ibrox. Ogilvie, who revealed that the 10-per-cent limit on Ashley’s stake in the club extends to members of his family, said the issue of ‘influence’ was at the heart of their request for details. Asked to provide a definition of ‘influence’, Ogilvie said: ‘I wouldn’t say it’s clear. A lot depends on the circumstances at any one time, the situation at the club. ‘That’s the very point we’re trying to get more information on, so I don’t want to second guess what kind of reply we’re getting.’ Rangers train ahead of their Championship clash with Cowdenbeath on Tuesday .","Donald Findlay claimed at the weekend that Rangers are unrecognisable .

"In an era when the retirement of players from international football seems almost mandatory once they reach 30, how refreshing that some still see the honour of representing their country as the pinnacle. At 34, Los Angeles resident Robbie Keane hardly needs the aggravation of jetting across the Atlantic to pull on the green shirt of Ireland several times a year. The current beneficiaries of his talent, LA Galaxy, are scarcely likely to be thrilled at the prospect either. It’s not as if Keane still harbours a desire to appear at a major international competition - having book-ended his Ireland career with the 2002 World Cup and the 2012 European Championships. And, with 65 goals and 137 caps to his name, both his scoring and appearance records look safe for some time to come. Robbie Keane is still flourishing on the international stage with the Republic of Ireland . Frankly, most players in his boots would have grown weary of it all by now. When you can count Inter Milan, Liverpool, Tottenham and Celtic among your former employers, the career ‘to do’ list tends to be rather on the small size. Yet the Dubliner’s desire to achieve even more remains as strong as ever. On Friday night, he will attempt to once again do what he does best in a place oh so familiar to him. For Mark McGhee, a professional rivalry between Scotland and Ireland won’t impinge on his admiration for a player whose club career he launched at Wolves 17 years ago. ‘I gave Robbie his debut,’ the Scotland assistant manager recalled yesterday. ‘I always believed he could be special. Even at that age he was sensational and he’s had a sensational career. ‘I’m delighted for him. He’s a great lad and I remember the day he made his debut at Norwich. He was 17, we brought over his mum and dad and I still remember the emotion in the directors’ box when he scored the two goals. He’s a fantastic lad, a fantastic player and has had a marvellous career.’ McGhee’s own career, both as player and manager, saw him brush up against some special emerging talents. Yet, asked if the teenage Keane trumped the lot, there was hardly a shred of doubt in his reply. ‘Pretty much. I gave Emile Heskey his debut as well and he was totally different from Robbie - just a beast, a great player at that age. But Robbie, technically as a player playing against men, was just fantastic. ‘One of the things that’s impressed me about him is that over the years he has matured. He has really become a man, coming from being a kind of Jack the lad little Irish boy, to quite a serious and respected individual, captaining his country. It’s a fantastic rise. He’ll be relishing this game, going to Parkhead, that’s for sure.’ That’s an understatement. For the 60,000 who will cram in, there are hardly words to describe the sense of anticipation. Not just a European Championship qualifier but a joust between two Celtic nations. Two former Celtic managers going head-to-head in the venue where they were revered. Too many sub-plots and scores to settle from club football to count. And Roy Keane to boot. Keane plays for club side LA Galaxy in the MLS which means several transatlantic journies a year . There’s so much to consider, so many colourful strands to it all, that the core business is in danger of being lost. But McGhee offers a reality check to those members of the Tartan Army caught up in the euphoria of the upturn we’ve enjoyed under Gordon Strachan and the misguided notion that Ireland are somehow there for the taking. ‘I don’t think we’ve achieved anything yet. That (the positive mood) has still to be consolidated. We can go a long way towards doing that if we get a positive result on Friday. Equally, that can evaporate quickly. We have a lot of work to do, a long way to go. ‘Results like beating Croatia are incremental. It’s another little step towards the next step and getting a more positive attitude going into each game. It gets the players behind the manager and the fans behind the players. We are on the right track but it’s not a done deal yet. ‘We have made some progress but it has still to manifest itself in a real positive outcome and that would only be in qualifying - whether it’s beating Ireland, drawing with Poland, it’s irrelevant - the only thing that matters is qualifying. If we do that, we can say we’ve improved.’ McGhee is right. A feelgood factor has never won anybody anything and, to date, has never seen a team qualify. Scotland have (mistakenly) basked in notions of self-worth at various junctures since France 1998 and yet the big stage has remained beyond our reach. And yet, for all one bad result could see us deviate badly from the road to France, there’s no disputing that since winning in Zagreb there’s been something in the air. ‘We’re getting ourselves into a position where we may achieve more than recently, but the bottom line is the players have taken on Gordon’s work ethic,’ said McGhee. ‘They don’t come here to be on holiday. They come to train and work hard and we go into the games having worked as hard as you can ask any group of players.’ Keane peels away after scoring for Ireland against Gibraltar last month . Without labouring the point about how dysfunctional Scotland had become under Craig Levein, there is no disputing Strachan has overseen a sea change. ‘A style had to emerge,’ McGhee said. ‘We had to have a consistent way of playing. We had to work on the same things and not chop and change. Find a way of playing that suited the players and what’ s expected of them. ‘To some degree we’ve managed that. When we play Ireland, everyone will expect to see us playing a certain way. Some days we’ll play better than others but we are playing consistently in a style that suits the players.’ It’s almost impossible to underplay the importance of a victory for either nation. Ireland’s draw in Germany indirectly winded Scotland – and rendered our brave defeat in Dortmund nigh on futile. By the time we face the world champions again in September, McGhee fully expects normal service to have been resumed. ‘I expect Germany to come back steamrolling in the second phase of the group. The fact Poland also got those three points against them changes it. ‘We might be looking at having to beat Poland at home, whereas if they hadn’t beaten Germany a draw might have done us. The best way to look at it is that we are playing Ireland and there are three points up for grabs. They are the only three points we can affect.’ The familiar personnel on both sides might make Friday’s game feel more like club selects facing each other as opposed to an international qualifier. It will be something of a battle but McGhee feels the winner of the physical contest won’t necessarily win the match. ‘In modern teams you have to be able to play and mix it. The Premier League and Championship in England are hugely physical competitions. These players play in that week in, week out and know the physical as well as the technical challenge it takes. ‘The team that manages to play well and be technical within the cauldron that will be created, will be the team which will win. The team that keeps their heads will prevail.’","Robbie Keane is still loving life with the Republic of Ireland .

"Lille boss Rene Girard has claimed that Belgian forward Divock Origi is as good as Everton pair Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o. The 19-year-old joined Liverpool in a £10million summer deal, but was immediately loaned back to Lille for the current season. After his performance against Everton in Thursday's Europa League clash, Girard believes he is as good as either of Everton's strike duo. Rene Girard has claimed that Divock Origi is as good as Everton pair Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o . 'In today's game, at least, I saw no difference in quality between Origi and Everton's Eto'o or Lukaku,' Girard told Goal. 'We will go to Everton in two weeks hoping to get a result there.' Origi, who is considered one of Belgium's brightest young talents, was used as a substitute during the World Cup, but still managed to score twice - more than international team-mate Lukaku or Cameroon captain Eto'o. With the success of Origi at Lille, and Mario Balotelli's underwhelming performances since moving from AC Milan, Liverpool supporters may be hoping their club can bring the young forward to Anfield sooner than originally planned. Origi impressed for Belgium during the World Cup, and managed to score two goals in Brazil .

"Ally McCoist has appealed for cool heads and calm in the build up to the first meeting of Rangers and Celtic since 2012. The fierce Glasgow rivals will face each other in the semi-finals of the League Cup on January 31 or February 1. Wary of the hype and mayhem which might attach itself to a resumption of hostilities, however, McCoist called for all involved to show restraint. Ally McCoist's Rangers, who play in the Scottish Championship, will face Celtic in the Old Firm at end of January . Rangers boss McCoist has called for calm ahead of the clash as it is still three months away . With emotions still running high following Rangers’ financial collapse, McCoist said: ‘It is only right we make an early appeal for calm. ‘Common sense has to play its part in all of this. I believe there has been a frenzy for this fixture in some quarters. I understand that, I get it. But from a sanity point of view we are talking about a game that’s still three months away. ‘It’s the first Old Firm game in almost three years and I hope all the fans can come along and enjoy. But let’s remember we have a duty and a responsibility here.’ McCoist was involved in a touchline clash with Neil Lennon during the so-called ‘shame game’ in 2011 which prompted a Scottish Government summit. Aware the behaviour of players, management and supporters will be closely scrutinised after a two and a half year hiatus, he added: ‘We should look forward to the occasion. Celtic players celebrate their impressive 6-0 win over Partick Thistle in the League Cup on Wednesday . ‘We have missed these matches and all eyes will be on us once again. We must remember we have a responsibilty to conduct ourselves in the proper manner. We all want to win but also to ensure it’s an occasion and a match to remember.’ Reacting to reports Celtic players loudly cheered the draw on Saturday, he claimed the response of his own players was more sombre. ‘Unlike the Celtic dressing room there was no hollering when it was made,’ he said. ‘There was a quiet nod of the head from some. That will do for me. ‘I said: “Great lads, that’s the draw and that’s who we are getting but we’ve got Cowdenbeath on Tuesday.” They all nodded in agreement. ‘With all due respect to everyone involved in this game, I have more Old Firm experience than anyone at the two clubs. We’ll keep our feet on the ground, I will ensure that. Celtic players celebrate during their 3-0 win over rivals Rangers back in April 2012 in the Scottish Premiership . ‘Nothing in the next three months will surprise me or shock me. You don’t need to tell me or my players what this game means. ‘I’m fortunate to have the likes of McCulloch, Miller and Boyd. These boys have been over the course. I looked at the three of them when the draw was made. There was no hooping or hollering or high-fiving.’ He expressed some sympathy for League Cup holders Aberdeen and Dundee United, whose last-four clash will be underplayed as a result. ‘Listen, 99.9 per cent of the public wanted to see this game.’ said McCoist. ‘I also understand the Aberdeen and Dundee United players having their noses out of joint because of the interest that will surround our game. ‘Everybody is talking about the Old Firm game. But I have to sympathise with the two clubs Ronny (Deila) has said are better than us. They have a game to look forward to as well but that fixture has been overshadowed.’ Gary Hooper completed the scoring during Celtic's 3-0 win over Rangers in the last Old Firm derby in 2012 .","Rangers will face Celtic in League Cup semi-final at end of January .

"To the chairman of Cowdenbeath nights with the directors of Rangers are not the occasions they once were. Donald Findlay QC should be comfortable in the midst of David Somers and co. He was once one of them. Vice-chairman of the company indeed. But these days he neither recognises the faces or names of the Rangers board. Or, indeed, the 'new entity' – his words – that they represent. Former Rangers vice chairman Donald Findlay believes the Ibrox outfit are almost like a new side . Findlay believes Ally McCoist's side is almost like a new team following their relegation to the lower leagues . 'Welcoming them to Central Park will be no different to welcoming anyone else for me,' Findlay tells Sportsmail, a vague waft of pipe tobacco detectable in windowless side room in Glasgow's High Court. 'Why should it be? 'I don't have many old friends there now. None on the organisational side. 'I know Alistair McCoist and Durranty. But I don't actually know who is involved there any more. 'Rangers coming is a big occasion for the club and the town of course. The last time they played Cowdenbeath in a league game was April 1971. The game was originally scheduled to have been played on January 9 – but was postponed because it was the Saturday after the Ibrox disaster.' This appreciation of the history of Rangers is a feature of the conversation. Findlay, trademark whiskers now greying slightly, is wistful on the past and shows no compunction over turning his legal mind to one of the most heated and prolonged debates in Scottish football. His learned friend Lord Nimmo Smith may have declared otherwise. But to Donald Findlay the Rangers which visits Cowdenbeath on Tuesday is not the same Rangers he once served. 'It is a different club,' he tells Sportsmail bluntly. 'They may play at Ibrox and they may play sometimes in royal blue jerseys. 'But you cannot pass on that which is undefinable. And that is spirit and tradition and all the rest of it. 'To me this is a new Rangers which has to establish its own history and tradition. But it's not the Rangers I know. To me, genuinely, it is a new entity.' Findlay feels sorry for fans of the Ibrox side who have stuck by their club in recent years . In Rangers circles this kind of thing is heresy. When liquidation became inevitable Charles Green, the former Chief Executive, insisted vocally he had paid £5.5million for the assets and history of the oldco in May 2012. Recently, Livingston's programmed editor lost his job after wading into a contentious topic in a match programme. Asked why he flies in the face of the consensus among Rangers supporters - that they remain the same club they always were - Findlay insists his view is a personal one. In his mind – he is now 63 – things have changed. 'Well, the view I have is one expressed to me by a lot of other Rangers supporters. 'There is just not the same sense of things being done the Rangers way. 'A lot of Rangers supporters – and these are the guys I feel sorry for – paid their money and remained loyal and followed the team through thick and thin. And they tell me there is just something missing now. 'That's not only my view. It's what I am told by people from the inside in the sense that they go to Ibrox. Something has changed, something is missing. It's just somehow… different.' This sense of creeping disenfranchisement with the running of Rangers is not unusual. Among fan groups talk of boycott is now rife. Suggesting that a club playing at Ibrox in blue jerseys before Rangers supporters might be a 'new' Rangers, however, triggers a fresh stream of consciousness in one of Scotland's great adversaries. The former believes Rangers should not move away from Ibrox as the ground is steeped in history . 'You can buy assets,' he concedes, 'but you can't buy history. You can't buy tradition. History and tradition are in the heart and in the mind. You can't buy that. 'I don't care what anyone says.You cannot buy Ibrox, you cannot buy the Blue Room, you cannot buy the trophy room without actually understanding what it means. 'I mean what every little piece of it means right down to the crests on the radiators in the Blue Room that were made in the same shipyards which made the Queen Elizabeth liners.' There is the sense that Findlay, a formidable adversary and hired gun paid to represent some of the most notorious criminals in the country, has given this some thought. 'You could argue that if they (Rangers) had moved from Ibrox to a brand new stadium at the time the whole thing collapsed, called it Rangers and played in blue that you would automatically be taking all that history and tradition with you. 'Well, maybe some people can. That's fine. Good luck to them. 'But for me personally tradition and history is in here.' He jabs a finger on his left hand towards his heart, an imprint on his black waistcoat clearly evident. 'It's not in material things. It's understanding what the material things mean. 'It's understanding what a genuine privilege it was to walk up the marble staircase. 'Not every Tom, Dick and Harry should trail up the marble staircase at Ibrox you know.' In recent years, of course, a long process of Tom, Dicks, Craigs and Charlies have done just that. Findlay won't be drawn on what he thinks of this. 'So I'm told,' is all he offers. He walked up the stairs for the last time 15 years ago. The events which led to a humiliating public resignation have been well documented. Captured on camera at a club function singing 'The Sash' he was subsequently reported to considered suicide. He has no wish to rake over old coals. 'It's so far in the past I'm not going back there. Things happen to you, you deal with them and move on.' He has revelled in running his hometown club of Cowdenbeath for the last five, fraught years on a simple rule of thumb. Frustrated by the lack of media attention – 'your paper and others treat us like s***' - the Fife club spend only what they earn. Asked if the history of Rangers might have been different if he had hung around longer to espouse this manta he is mildly dismissive. 'Ach, I don't know. I can't say if I could have changed things if I had stayed longer.Many people have come and gone since then making decisions of which I know very little about.' Rangers, he claims, were living within their means when he left. The more extravagant spending of the Advocaat years had yet to begin. 'The budget at that time was managed and in control and covered. If you are taking a financial risk it has to be against a background of knowing you can cover that risk.' He won't deny that the spending at Ibrox was far higher than anywhere else. Rangers unashamedly 'lorded it' over their rivals, including Celtic, and savoured every minute. One reason, he believes, why there was a marked lack of sympathy among rival clubs when they hurtled towards the fiscal cliff two and a half years ago. 'Looking back on it you do think that sometimes what goes around comes around. 'I mean, come on …. to win nine championships in a row? You are entitled to lord it a bit over the opposition then - and I think we did. 'You knew perfectly well that when you were beaten and your opponents said 'thank you very much' that the minute you left the room they would be aiming a one arm salute at your back. That was fine. 'There was a terrific relationship with the old Celtic board you know. There was nothing personal about it. Chris White and others were personal friends. 'But, yes, it probably did heighten the sense of schadenfreude two years ago. But it was definitely good for business.' Findlay is not sure if the current crop of Rangers star will be able to win promotion back to the Premiership . Rangers will have to beat off competition from Hearts and Hibs if they are going to earn promotion . The presence of Rangers in the Championship is equally good for business for Cowdenbeath now. Findlay is under no illusions their presence is a short term situation. How short term is the million dollar question. 'Is it inevitable Rangers will go up this season? Absolutely not. 'I said that before the season started. There is absolutely no guarantee Rangers will go up, far from it. 'They would be one of the favourites from the play-offs because of the resources they potentially have. 'But Rangers, Hearts and Hibs? One of them will be in the Championship next year- guaranteed. Queen of the South and Falkirk are also ambitious clubs. 'So it's by no means guaranteed Rangers will go up. 'I could be selfish and say that suits me fine. I want them for another season in the championship but for the good of the wider game in Scotland it's time Rangers were back in the Premiership.' He is unrepentant on this. Rangers and Celtic, he believes, are simply too big to fail in a Scottish context. 'They are not just football clubs – they are national institutions. 'They have a presence in sport and also make a contribution to the economy which is huge. 'Of course it's sad to see a great club the way it is. To see Rangers reduced is heart-breaking. 'People lost a lot of money and something had to be done about that. It was wrong the way small businesses and shareholders lost money. 'But has it benefitted the game Rangers being in the lower divisions? Is the game better because of it? I'm not sure it is you know…'","Donald Findlay feels sorry for Rangers fans who have stuck by the club .

Fabregas has been in fine form for his new club this season, with two goals and 11 assists in 15 appearances, and his injury is a blow to Spain as they seek to bounce back from last month's 2-1 defeat in Slovakia. Cesc Fabregas has been ruled out of Spain's next Euro 2016 Group C qualifier, against Belarus . Fabregas played the whole 90 minutes of Chelsea's game against Liverpool on Saturday afternoon . Villarreal midfielder Bruno Soriano was called up to replace him in the squad.

"Duane Vermeulen admits complacency was a factor in South Africa's loss to Ireland, but vowed intensity levels will return for Saturday's Test with England at Twickenham. Little more than a month after beating New Zealand - ending the world champion All Blacks' 22-match unbeaten run - in the Rugby Championship, the Springboks were beaten 29-15 in Dublin. Assistant coach John McFarland was asked if the intensity of Monday's training session was a recognition that the players lacked attitude against the Irish. Duane Vermeulen is hoping for an improved performance against England after his side lost to Ireland . Bryan Habana works on his strength during South Africa's training session at Latymer Upper School . Bismarck du Plessis and Tendai Mtawarira are put through their paces during Tuesday's training session . McFarland said: 'We possibly were not at the levels that we had been over the Championship. We know we've got big improvements to make.' Vermeulen was less diplomatic. The Stormers number eight said: 'After beating New Zealand you kind of feel like, ""Hey this is where we're supposed to be"". 'You've got to pitch up every single weekend. You can't beat the world number one and then think you're invincible. 'Hopefully we can come back, play the rugby we want to play and to produce.' Vermeulen admits his performance was below-par, having been spoken of alongside New Zealand's Kieran Read as the world's best number eight in 2014. 'I wasn't great,' added Vermeulen, who tried to accentuate the positives. 'It's nice to learn how you get knocked off your high horse and you've got to fight your way back. 'Every single game is a learning curve for each and every single player. 'There's always stuff to work on. You always want to be the best. '(And) when you're up there you've got to bloody work hard to stay there. 'I still have a lot of goals that I want to reach, but I think we're on the right track. I've just got to keep working.' Springbok coach Heyneke Meyer believes his side let 'South Africa down' during their defeat by Ireland . Forwards coach Johann van Graan prepares a training drill while his players warm up in the background . Vermeulen's 'high-horse' metaphor could be applied to the team, and England should be wary. Asked if Ireland pointed England to South Africa's flaws, McFarland added: 'We know we can play a lot better than we did on Saturday. It's up to the England coaches to decide what's good for their team this weekend. 'Maybe they've got different personnel. Maybe if they play (Bath fly-half George) Ford it will be different type of game, they'll be a different type of team. 'I wouldn't tell them how to play their game.' An improved defensive display is of paramount importance. Vermeulen added: 'We want to get a team down to under 13 or 15 points a match. That's our challenge and we couldn't do that. 'The English have a good attacking threat. They play good rugby. Hopefully we can keep them down in that 15-point margin.' If you concede fewer than 15 points, there is a high chance you will win the Test match, according to the Springboks. JP Pietersen (left) goes over for a late consolation try for South Africa against Ireland as they lost 29-15 . McFarland added: 'We've looked at the average amount that a team concedes over a year. If you concede less than 15, you've got a good chance of winning a Test match. Statistically everyone's around that level. '[But] there's no point in conceding no tries and six penalties. If you get around that, you'll win Test matches.' Indeed, penalties can be decisive, particularly as the likes of Ireland's Jonny Sexton and Owen Farrell of England rarely err in front of the posts. 'We need to be more disciplined,' McFarland added. 'The kickers, from Farrell to Sexton, all kick at 100 per cent. You've got to be right on the money in terms of your discipline.' The match is a useful warm-up for the Springboks ahead of next year's World Cup, not just because of the opposition, but also due to the venue. Belfast-born McFarland, who worked under Clive Woodward at London Irish before moving to South Africa in 2000, expects the Springboks to be back to their best at Twickenham, from the first whistle. McFarland added: 'There's a need for us to really come out and put our physicality on the game in that first 20 minutes on Saturday.'","South Africa's Duane Vermeulen believes his side were complacent during their 29-15 defeat against Ireland .
The Springboks take on England at Twickenham on Saturday .
John McFarland has called on his side to make 'big improvements'"
"There was unrest on both sides about the officiating at Twickenham, with England enraged by one key decision against them and New Zealand bemoaning the impact of big-screen replays. Welsh referee Nigel Owens angered the hosts and the majority of the sell-out crowd by promptly awarding a try to All Black fly-half Aaron Cruden in the first half, despite TV footage showing he may have been short of the line and guilty of a double movement. There were plenty of referrals after that, so England head coach Stuart Lancaster was frustrated that one wasn’t requested at such a pivotal moment. Nigel Owens explains a decision to England captain Chris Robshaw during a difficult display for the referee . England were unhappy that Aaron Cruden's try wasn't checked by the Television Match Official on Saturday . ‘We went to the TMO quite a lot of times but not on that occasion, which we probably need to have a chat about,’ he said. Farcically, when the Irish TMO, Simon McDowell, was asked for a ruling about the angry kick by Dane Coles which ultimately earned the Kiwi hooker a yellow card, he informed Owens there had been a kick but that a yellow card was not required. Yet, the referee, struggling to hear his colleague via his earpiece, watched the replays on the big screen, over-ruled McDowell and dispatched Coles. Owens came under fire from both sides, mostly for his decisions regarding referrals to the TMO . Owens shows Dane Coles a yellow card, after mis-hearing the advice from the television official . Meanwhile, New Zealand coach Steve Hansen expressed alarm at what he regards as a creeping issue of home-biased replays governing official decisions after Charlie Faumuina’s 72nd-minute try was belatedly referred by Owens as Beauden Barrett was about to take the conversion. ‘My biggest concern is not the ref or TMO, it is that TV producers are starting to have an influence on the game,’ said Hansen. ‘It’s not on the away side, I might add. If something goes wrong we see a replay 10 times. The ref has not seen it, the touch judge has not seen it, the TMO has not seen it — we need to bring in a challenge so that if the coach or skipper has seen it, he can challenge. New Zealand were unhappy at the decision to check Charlie Faumuina's try before the conversion . 'We don’t need a TV producer replaying it 100 times. That’s not the spirit of our game. ‘Referees will make mistakes just like players will, and sometimes those mistakes will cost you the game. You have to live with that and some days you will get the rub of the green. ‘The TV producers are starting to annoy me somewhat.’ New Zealand No 8 Kieran Read echoed his coach’s misgivings, adding: ‘If that’s the way they’re going to play it, it’s going to turn the game into NFL. ‘You want them to make the right decisions, so we have to use the technology that’s there, but they should make a decision and stick to it.’","England felt Aaron Cruden's first-half try should have been referred .

"Mehdi Abeid believes in-form Newcastle striker Ayoze Perez can be one of the buys of the season. The midfielder thinks his team-mate can take the Barclays Premier League by storm now he has settled at the Magpies. Perez has three goals in his last three games after his stunning strike in their 2-0 win at West Brom on Sunday. Ayoze Perez scored a stunning goal against West Brom as Newcastle won their fifth game in a row . He flicked Daryl Janmaat's cross in with his heel from 12 yards to inspire Newcastle to a fifth straight win in all competitions. The Magpies bought the Spaniard for a reported fee of around £1.5million from Tenerife in the summer and Abeid insisted Perez is a bargain. He said: 'If he continues like this he can be a big player for us. 'He needs to score, he is very technical - a very good player - and we know he can do big things for us. 'We always knew he is a very, very good player, we are really happy for him and I hope he will score a lot more for us. 'The goal was really technical and we can see in training he has some great skills and he showed it on Sunday.' The Magpies have risen to eighth in the Barclays Premier League table after four successive wins, along with beating Manchester City in the League Cup. Newcastle have suddenly found their form to boost previously under-fire manager Alan Pardew . It has lifted the pressure off manager Alan Pardew and Algeria Under 23 international Abeid insisted they always believed their season would turn, despite failing to win any of their opening seven league games. 'We've always been working to have some success,' said the 22-year-old. 'We have to keep showing we're a good team and we can do our best every game. Sunday was a great win for the team. 'Now it's a good time to have some fresh air, to play with the national teams and we will come back better and fresh for the next couple of games.' Abeid made only his second league start for Newcastle at The Hawthorns and has broken into the first team after spending last season on loan at Panathinaikos. 'A lot has changed, I've been out on loan a lot and I have come back here to have some time to play and show the manager and the club I can play for them. I am really happy,' said Abeid, who also went on loan to St Johnstone in 2013. 'I knew I had to play football and that's what I went and did, to play football and enjoy my time. I got a lot of experience, I learned a lot and I came back with a strong mentality and a strong character.' Mehdi Abeid always believed Newcastle would turn their fortunes around this season .","Ayoze Perez cost Newcastle just £1.5million in the summer .

"Having spent the past two seasons watching Steffon Armitage smash opponents in matches and team-mates in training, Bryan Habana admits he’s delighted not to be facing England’s exiled No 7 at Twickenham on Saturday. South Africa’s former World Player of the Year has no doubt his Toulon colleague, who is unavailable for selection because of the RFU’s policy of not picking overseas-based players, would make Stuart Lancaster’s side a more fearsome proposition. England captain Chris Robshaw will wear the No 7 shirt against the Springboks though many pundits, including Sportsmail columnist Sir Clive Woodward, believe the Harlequin would be better suited at blindside with the destructive, scavenging Armitage in the pivotal openside position. Toulon's flanker Steffon Armitage has not been selected by England because he is playing overseas . Armitage has been in good form for Toulon but will not be selected for England while playing in France . After spending two seasons alongside Armitage at Toulon, where the Englishman has played a central role in back-to-back Heineken Cup victories and was last season named European Player of the Year, Habana agrees. ‘I’m very happy I play with Steffon at Toulon and in the same breath I’m very happy I am not playing against him this weekend,’ Habana said. ‘Steffon is a quality player who proved last season, not only in the Top 14 but also in the Heineken Cup, that he wouldn’t let that English outfit down. Chris Robshaw is set to wear the No 7 shirt but many believe he is better suited to the blindside . ‘The powers that be have certain rules and we have to let that stand but I think he could play a big part in this English team if he got that opportunity.’ Armitage, 29, won five caps under Martin Johnson but has not played for England since before the last World Cup. But he still hopes he could be considered for next autumn’s World Cup under the ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause in the RFU regulations. That hope appears slim after Lancaster last week reaffirmed his backing for a selection policy designed to discourage players from moving the French Top 14, where average salaries are significantly higher than those in the Aviva Premiership. Armitage won five caps for England when he was playing for London Irish between 2009 and 2011 . ‘Who knows what will happen?’ Habana added. ‘Come 10 months’ time at the start of the World Cup there might be a case for special inclusion for someone like Steffon, who really has played an influential part in the success Toulon have had over the past two or three seasons. ‘He’s playing a brand of rugby that means he should be selected but at this stage England are adhering to their protocols. So I am sad he has not gone on to higher honours this time around and also happy I won’t be facing him this time too.’ Last month Bath made an audacious bid to bring Armitage back across the Channel but were thwarted when Lancaster refused to give assurances to the former London Irish player about his inclusion in England’s elite player squad. Bryan Habana prepares for South Africa's international with England at Twickenham on Saturday . Habana is unable to stop  Ireland's Tommy Bowe as South Africa lost their opening tour game in Dublin . ‘It’s sad that a player of his calibre isn’t getting exposure at international level,’ Habana added. ‘He definitely wouldn’t let that England jersey down, but unfortunately he chose that option a couple of years ago and has to live by his decision. ‘As a player you understand the rules and regulations so when you do decide to take an offer overseas coming from a country where those rules are in place, you fully understand what you’re getting into. ‘I’ve had chats with Steffon about it. It’s difficult for him. He really loves England and loved playing for the country. ‘It’s frustrating if you’ve been playing a level of rugby that sees you named European player of the year yet are not playing for your international team. ‘It could be a little heart-breaking for him, but it’s a decision he’s taken and a decision he understands.’ Anthony Watson is expected to be named in the England side in place of injured Semesa Rokoduguni . Courtney Lawes is expected to start for England despite going off with concussion against New Zealand . Habana was  named to face England by Springbok coach Heyneke Meyer, who has made five changes to the side who surprisingly lost to Ireland in Dublin last Saturday. Schalk Burger returns to face Robshaw on the openside flank and half-backs Handre Pollard and Francois Hougaard are dropped in favour of Pat Lambie and Cobus Reinach. Meyer said: ‘We’ve accepted that our performance against Ireland last weekend was not up to scratch and everyone in the touring squad has put up their hands this week. ‘We’ve really worked hard at fixing the mistakes we made and the challenge now is to put that into action on Saturday.’ Lancaster names his side on Thursday with Anthony Watson expected to be given his first start on the right wing opposite Habana following the withdrawal of Semesa Rokoduguni with injury. Courtney Lawes is expected to be named at lock despite having been taken off 23 minutes into Saturday’s defeat against New Zealand suffering concussion following two separate head knocks in the space of four minutes which left him with an egg-sized lump on the side of his head. Lancaster is set to persevere with Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt in midfield, despite calls to move Owen Farrell to inside centre and give George Ford his first start at 10. But Robshaw admits his side are under huge pressure following their opening QBE series loss to the All Blacks. He said: ‘Whenever it’s a tournament or a series you want to start with a win. There’s probably nothing worse than starting a series with a loss. So there’s a huge amount of pressure on the guys to go out and deliver this weekend. ‘We’re not going to wait for the physicality and intensity which I’m sure these guys will bring. Being at home we want to impose ourselves and get back on track.’ The autumn internationals on Sky Sports are part of an unrivalled schedule of rugby union with over 360 matches from the international, European and domestic game.","Steffon Armitage has not been selected by England since moving to Toulon from London Irish in 2011 .

"Mikel Arteta has revealed that he spoke to David Moyes about Real Sociedad before he took the job in La Liga. Moyes, 51, was confirmed as the Basque side's new boss on Monday, and used to work with the Spanish midfielder at Everton. And Arteta, now captain at Arsenal, admits that while Moyes had 'doubts' about his next move after leaving Manchester United last April, he expects him to excel at Sociedad. Mikel Arteta worked with David Moyes at Everton and says he wants him to excel at Real Sociedad . Moyes was appointed as Real Sociedad's new manager on Monday . 'I gave him my opinion about la Real,' he told Cadena Ser . 'He's a coach that likes to tighten the reigns, he'll do well with the group. He demands a lot and works hard, he's not what you'd call a 'typical' English manager that sits on the bench. 'He analyses a lot and he has a clear idea of how he wants his team to play. 'There are things (like the language barrier or knowledge of Spanish football) that could have an adverse effect, but when he made the decision to come to Real Sociedad over the other offers he had, it's because he sees their potential moving forward.' Arteta is currently Arsenal's club captain but his contract runs out next summer . Moyes was sacked as manager of Manchester United in April but has been tipped to shine in La Liga . Arteta himself used to play for Sociedad, though he did not make the grade before coming to Britain as a youngster. And the 32-year-old, whose contract at Arsenal runs out in the summer, has praised Moyes'man motivation skills. He added: 'If he's not able to get the team moving forward from the start, it's going to hurt him.

"Joe Marler has urged England to use the anger caused by Saturday's collapse to New Zealand to fuel their backlash against South Africa. The 2015 World Cup hosts took a deserved 14-11 lead into the interval of their QBE Series opener, only to be comprehensively outplayed in a second half affected by monsoon-like conditions, as the All Blacks ran out 24-21 winners. Marler was scathing of a performance that resulted in a fifth successive defeat by the All Blacks and has demanded an emphatic response when South Africa visit Twickenham this weekend. England prop Joe Marler takes on All Black wing Julian Savea at Twickenham on Saturday . Marler congratulates Gloucester wing Jonny May after his early try gave England the lead . 'Our levels of frustration are high and the game review was very honest. I can't really use the words that I'd like to use!' the Harlequins captain said. 'We knew what we had to do in that second half. We spoke about it at half time. And then we came out and did the opposite. Now we expect a reaction from ourselves. 'We'll take the frustration into this weekend. From a personal point of view it's important to use that frustration to spur you on that little bit more.' England have not beaten South Africa in 11 matches dating back to 2006, with their best performance a 14-14 draw in Port Elizabeth two years ago. Harlequins captain Marler talks to the media at England's Pennyhill Park training base on Monday . Marler made the first of his 23 Test appearances against the Springboks and they left a lasting impression, but the loosehead refuses to be cowed by them or any of the southern hemisphere heavyweights. 'The 2012 tour was a baptism of fire for some of us. Physicality is part and parcel of their culture,' Marler said. 'Against every international team you've got to be physical otherwise you're going to get pumped, but South Africa as a nation stand very tall and proud. 'Their DNA is run hard and if that doesn't work then run harder. They pride themselves on that. 'It always takes more than we expect from ourselves to beat the southern hemisphere teams. Ireland wing Tommy Bowe celebrates scoring a try as South Africa are beaten in Dublin on Saturday . 'They've set the standard over the years and are continuing to do so, but I'd like to think we've got a squad now who can stand toe-to-toe with them. 'It's about having the belief that we're not just capable of hanging in there, but can ramp it up ourselves at the right time and take them to some darker places.' Head coach Stuart Lancaster insists confidence remains intact despite a run of four consecutive losses, albeit each of them to Richie McCaw's reigning world champions. 'I don't think self-belief has been dented in that we're going in the wrong direction, but losing has made it important to produce that 100 per cent performance,' Lancaster said.","England beaten 24-21 by New Zealand in autumn international series opener .

"Billy Joe Saunders interrupted Chris Eubank Jnr's press conference  from his Spanish training camp in Marbella by appearing on Skype to send a warning to his British rival. Eubank Jnr revealed he had finally signed a deal to fight Saunders on November 29 at the ExCeL in front of 20,000 spectators. However Saunders, who has put his European, Commonwealth and British titles on the line, seemed to be irate at both Eubank Jnr and his father despite the two camps finally coming to an agreement with the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) over the upcoming fight.

Saunders, who held up a skeleton during the Skype call to represent what he is going to do to his middleweight rival, said to Eubank Jnr via Skype: 'You have no balls.

"Designer Camilla Franks has revealed she is battling a devastating illness which has left her emotionally 'insecure and vulnerable'. While working in India last year, the 37-year-old said she was diagnosed with the debilitating Bell's palsy - a suspected infection or auto-immune response that results in paralysis to one side of the face. 'I remember in the morning I felt tingles and a headache, and my design team were upstairs, then all of a sudden my face just dropped, and next minute I was racing to emergency and neurologists were around me thinking I’d had a stroke,' she told Sunday Style. Roller-coaster of emotion: Camilla Franks, pictured here at the Royal Hall of Industries, Moore Park, last year, said she has been diagnosed with Bells palsy . Doctors were then discussing the possibility of a brain tumour, before diagnosing her with Bell's palsy. She was made to stay in India for a week to wait for test results before being told she could fly home to Sydney. Despite working in India for seven years, Camilla said she missed home and was very lucky to be in a new relationship with The Potbelleez rocker Jonny Sonic - who was phoning her 'every second hour to make sure I was ok'. A self-confessed workaholic, the fashionista said having half her face paralysed without any indication of how long it would take to recover was one of the most challenging and confronting periods of her life. Camilla Franks and ex-boyfriend Ilan Kidron arrive at the 27th Annual ARIA Awards 2013 at the Star in December last year . 'I felt like I was on a roller-coaster ride of emotion. You’re put on quite heavy steroids, and unfortunately the doctors didn’t tell me what I would go through with that...there were days I just felt so depressed. 'It was a horrible experience [that could] happen to anyone, but, you know, a lot of insecurities and vulnerabilities came up.' Those vulnerabilities included five years of suffering on and off from glandular fever, as well as the death of her younger brother Ben, who tragically fell off a cliff at The Gap in Sydney. She said the loss changed her whole world, and said throwing herself into her work was a 'Band-Aid' solution to help her grieve. Camilla also said she has used the ordeal to make more time for herself, and has admitted to wanting to get married and start a family.","Designer Camilla Franks, 37, diagnosed with Bell's palsy .

"Dressed in her figure-hugging black suit with miniskirt, peep toe black high heels and smiling behind her black wraparound sunglasses, incest matriarch Betty Colt arrived at court with a naughty grin and a 'hello gentleman' for the waiting photographers. Moments earlier the woman whose family is believed to be the most depraved example of inter-family relationships in Australian history, had stepped from a sleek dark grey late model Ford Territory four-wheel drive. Ms Colt was wearing the latest of several stylish outfits, all funded by welfare, to a series of court appearances which ended on Monday, when Magistrate Mary Ryan jailed her for twelve months. Newstart smart: Police officers take Betty Colt iaway in handcuffs following her sentencing at Moss Vale Court in the NSW Southern Highlands. As with every court appearance Ms Colt, who wore a figure-hugging black suit and blue flowered top with peep toe black high heels, has been smartly dressed . Dainty: Despite being handcuffed and loaded off to a Sydney women's prison, Betty Colt manages to maintain her composure and modesty in the back of the NSW Police paddy wagon. She has now sapped her smart black suit for a set of prison greens, with an alternative choice of prison issue maroon or white t-shirts . Conviction: Betty Colt arrived at the Moss Vale Court in the NSW Southern Highland for her conviction dressed in a black pantsuit with a bright yellow shirt, accompanied by daughter Raylene, who was also smartly dressed in a black suit . This goes with that: Betty Colt at Moss Vale court (left) dressed in a black college-style suit with white piping at Moss Vale Court for charges of inciting her son to kidnap his brother, and (right) in a grey suit and fluffy white top with smart grey boots for an appearance in Parramatta Local Court over police demands for family members to give DNA samples . Trim figure: Betty Colt in black court shoes, a yellow patterned top and pantsuits arrives for a court apperance in the NSW Southern Highlands. Police phone transcripts reveal she complained about dwindling welfare payments after five of her 13 children were removed because of incest and neglect . Convicted of inciting her 16-year-old son Bobby to commit a crime, the unemployed mother of 13 children is currently confined to prison greens for at a minimum non-parole period of nine months. Betty Colt - a court appointed pseudonym to protect the identities of children - doesn't look like a woman discovered living with 38 inter-related adults and children in incestuous relationships and in the filth and squalor of a bush block with only tents and caravans and no running water or electricity. At each of her court appearances this at Parramatta and at Moss Vale in the NSW Southern Highlands, Ms Colt has turned up dressed smartly in a succession of crisp grey or black suits, with her glossy hair neatly blow dried or swept up and pinned in place with a pretty hair clip. Mother and daughter: Betty Colt (right) arriving at court this week with her equally well-dressed daughter, Raylene, who wore a yellow, black and white knit skirt with matching yellow top and black jacket. Betty is unemployed and lives on the government Newstart allowance . Complicated: The Colt family tree which shows that matriarch, Betty Colt, has 13 children, five of whom are the product  of a sexual relationship with her father or a brother. Her younger sister, Martha, has five surviving children, all of whom were fathered by her brother Charlie or another relative . Filth and squalor: Police and welfare officers were shocked and appalled with the scenes of filth, squalor and neglect they found children in on the rural property owned by the Colt family. In contrast to the dirty bare feet and low hygeine standards of her children, Betty Colt, has shown to be well-groomed and smartly dressed and drives a late model four-wheel drive car funded by the Australian Government's Newstart allowance . For the first hearing in which she faced conviction, she wore a black  yellow and white flowered top and skipped across the street in her heels. For the next hearing, when she was convicted, she wore a bright yellow shirt and black pantsuit which showed off her trim figure. At her sentencing, Ms Colt chose a sky blue top patterned with pink, grey and white flowers. And it's all done on social security payments. Her lawyer, Phil Carey, revealed that Ms Colt was funded only by a Newstart allowance. While previously she was funded with government payments for each of her 13 children aged under 18 years, court documents reveal that following the removal of five of her children by authorities, Ms Colt found she was struggling financially. A NSW Children's Court judge, Peter Johnstone, revealed that in July 2012, officers from the NSW Child Abuse Squad and the Family and Community Services Department swooped on the squalid rural property where the Colt family lived. The raid had been prompted by a remark, overheard in the schoolyard, by one of the young family members that his sister was having a baby and that the family didn't know which brother had fathered the child. The police and welfare officers were shocked and appalled about what the found on the scrub land block in the hills surrounding a picturesque farming community nestled in a valley southwest of Sydney. Sisters in grey: Betty and sister Rhonda sit on a  bench outside Parrmatta Local Court after family members appeared to respond to Child Abuse Squad demands they give buccal swabs of their saliva for DNA testingso that authorities could determine the complex inter-family relationships between 38 Colt adults and children . Betty Colt's sister and brother Martha and Charlie slept nightly in a 'marital' bed inside a tent on the squalid farm, where open buckets of faeces and urine lay about and where their children - brothers and sisters - had sex with each other. The children had facial deformities, could not speak intelligibly, did not know what a toothbrush or toilet paper were. Unlike well-groomed Betty, the children had filthy, bare feet, did not know how to wash their hair or bathe and slept in dirty beds among cigarette butts and rotting food. From smiles to tears: Betty Colt was all smiles when she arrived at court on Monday for her sentencing, but she wept after being given 12 months and was then bundled into a van and off to prison . Authorities removed 12 inbred, illiterate and malnourished children from the camp, including five of Betty's children, and placed them in care. The charges which led to her incarceration relate to the fact Ms Colt could not cope without her children, in particular her teenage sons Billy, 15, and Bobby, 16, the latter of whom Magistrate Ryan said Ms Colt and a 'overbearing and claustrophobic' relationship. Court files reveal a transcript of unrelenting text messages and phone calls between Betty Colt and Bobby and give an insight into the cloying influence she wreaked upon her son. Magistrate Ryan said Ms Colt's failed bid to kidnap her son from care and return him to the circumstances of neglect and rampant sexual abuse at the hands of relatives from which they were taken into care. She was sentenced at Moss Vale Court this week for devising a plan to get her both teenage sons, out of state care. Ms Colt's welfare payments had started to dwindle after five of her children were removed amid allegations of inter-generational incest and abuse. When she was sentenced in Moss Vale Local Court on Monday, she was on Newstart allowance, the court heard. In the one of the phone calls, she mentions that Centrelink was trying to stop her money. Police prosecutors said the matriarch wanted to take the boys to South Australia where they could work as fruit pickers and give the income to her, which Betty's lawyer denied in court. In phone conversations between Colt and Bobby heard by police, Colt defended police claims she didn't provide for her son. 'They think I didn't educate you enough and I couldn't afford the dentist,' she told  Bobby. 'That's only minor.'","Incest family matriarch Betty Colt is unemployed and on welfare .

The death comes as more than 200 others have been admitted to hospitals in South Australia for heat-related conditions. According . to Adelaide Now, 90 people were admitted to hospitals in South . Australia yesterday alone – including 65 in and around the city. Although temperatures cooled slightly today, the Adelaide, Canberra and Melbourne areas were all expected to top 40C. In Victoria, there are thought to be more than 40 fires burning out of control. In total, more than 70 have been recorded in the area. In New South Wales, meanwhile, there are reported to be almost 50 blazes, with 12 out of control. In South Australia, there are 19 blazes, according to ABC. In . Victoria, the state has estimated that fire conditions could be the . worst experienced since Black Saturday, when 173 people died in 2009. Fire crews and police - who said 12 fires burning in South Australia had been deliberately lit - ordered those with a chance of escaping the flames to evacuate their homes immediately. Those who had left it too late were told to stay inside. But many residents who were told there was still time to flee the flames said they would stay and try to defend their homes from the walls of fire and the burning embers that were flying from the blazes. The biggest fears are for residents and homes in the Northern Grampians, a hilly wine-producing region west of Melbourne which is steeped in Aboriginal history.

Even though the Country Fire Authority warned that a 'fast moving and out-of-control' bushfire was heading to the Brimpaen area in the Grampians many residents decided to stay and try to tackle the fire. Fire superintendent Graham Kent urged residents in the communities of Halls Gap and Dadswells Bridge to evacuate. 'The emergency services' primary mission is to preserve life,' he told a community meeting in Dadswells Bridge today. Emergency text messages were being . sent out to warn people of the approaching dangers, but not all the . messages were getting through, said police, because of reception . difficulties. Motel . owners Stephen and Peggy Odgers of Halls Gap said they would stay and . defend the Kookaburra Motor Lodge which they have owned for three years. The Adelaide heatwave has been affecting wildlife as well as humans, and nearly 100 flying foxes have been reported dead around the city’s botanic park. And, according to ABC, experts have predicted that more of the bats, exhausted in the conditions, will die. The 90 confirmed dead make up around a tenth of the colony in the area. Around 100 died of heat stress in Adelaide’s parklands. Last week, around 100,000 bats died as a result of the heatwave in Queensland. 'All of our guests have left and bookings have been cancelled,' said Mr Odgers, 'but most of our neighbours will be ignoring the recommendation to evacuate.' One fire in the Northern Grampians was over 11,000 hectares, swallowing up everything in its path. Throughout the afternoon today warnings were issued to dozens of small communities in the path of the fires. And health officials said that people living nowhere near bushland should not assume they were immune from ill-effects. Officials said that people living hundreds of miles from a bushfire could be affected by smoke, especially if they suffered from a pre-existing heart or lung condition. The fires have erupted through a number of factors - the extreme heatwave striking the south east corner of Australia, lightning strikes and the cruel activities of arsonists. A fire burning in Gippsland, a region to the east of Melbourne, could soon be covering more than 500,000 hectares, fire officials fear. The notorious 'bushfire season' in Australia has once again turned the sky red and sent plumes of black smoke over towns many miles away. Water-bombing planes and helicopters flew over the blazes but it seemed an almost futile battle against the size of the roaring fires. The Adelaide area was hotter yesterday than . Melbourne (41C), Canberra (37C) and Sydney and Brisbane (both 28C) as . Australia proved the hottest place on earth. Cooling off: Adelaide teenagers hit Glenelg beach earlier this week to avoid the scorching temperatures which have made their city unbearable . Other . top temperatures across the world were recorded in Mumbai (27C), India, . Peruvian capital Lima (26C), Singapore (28C) and Los Angeles in the . United States (28C). Temperatures in Adelaide have barely dropped beneath 30C over the last few nights. And in Melbourne, Australian Open tennis players and spectators alike were badly affected by the temperatures, which topped 40C. With . temperatures 2C higher than Wednesday, one player, Canadian Frank . Dancevic, hallucinated the cartoon dog Snoopy before fainting during a . match. Yesterday a climate research group warned Australia it can expect even . longer and hotter heat waves in the future than current one scorching large swathes of the country. The . privately run Climate Council, which includes former members of the . country’s government-funded climate change watchdog shut by prime minister Tony Abbott's conservative government last year, warned in a . report that Australia had only begun to feel the impact of climate . change. The heat wave, . says the report's author, Will Steffen, follows the felling of a host of . temperature records in 2013, including the hottest year on record. 'Australia has always had hot weather. However, climate change is loading the dice toward more extreme hot . weather,’ Steffen said. Hoping to avert climate change, . Australia aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 5 per cent below . 2000 levels by 2020, a target that requires a cut of 431 million tonnes . of CO2 between now and 2020. The government released details of a . $1.55billion (£0.8billion) Emissions Reduction Fund last month but some . experts say design flaws and a lack of clarity mean it is unlikely to . meet its climate targets. Phil Cohn, co-founder of clean technology . project developers Ramp Carbon, said the biggest problem with the ERF is . that it sets no overall cap on emissions for Australia, meaning there . would be no mechanism to ensure pollution doesn't spiral. ‘If we emit more in sectors that don't participate much in the ERF auctions, we are going to miss the target,’ he said.","Temperatures topped 46C in Roseworthy, near Adelaide, yesterday .

"Most people fear monster waves but not Western Australian quadriplegic Paul D'Vorak despite having no movement below his armpits. The risks of taking on the wild surf doesn’t worry the 41-year-old former champion surfer who uses a specially-designed board. Before his first surf at the bombie behind the Gallows break near Margaret River, others wanted to call it off due to the wind. But not D'Vorak who used his shoulders to take off on the first wave when he found himself in a spot of trouble. Paul D'Vorak pictured being attached to his specially designed surf board . Fearless: D'Vorak being towed out to catch the next wave . ‘I was stranded in the impact zone and copped a set on the head and got bounced off the reef and washed all the way to the beach,’ he told the ABC. However, this did not deter D’Vorak one bit. ‘I actually enjoyed the wipe-outs as much as I enjoyed catching the wave because there are a lot of sensations that I thought I'd never experience again,’ he said. ‘The first one hit me and pushed me for about 10 metres before it let me come up, he said. ‘The second one actually bounced me off the reef and rolled me on the bottom, and it was great to experience all those sensations and feelings again.' Being paralysed from under his armpits did not stop Paul D'Vorak (pictured being lowered in the water) from surfing again . D'Vorak didn't fear the wipe-outs when he caught his first waves since being paralysed . His friend Richard Horner was on rescue duty and quickly swam over to him and they headed straight back out again. D'Vorak proves - where there's a will there's a way . Ironically, it was not the unpredictable ocean that paralysed the former welder seven years ago. He was at a party standing next to a trampoline when the person who was jumping did not see him and landed on his head, breaking his neck. Not one to turn down a challenge, the fearless surfer was not prepared to give up the sport he loves despite his serious injury. Working with shaper Al Bean, D'Vorak has developed a wider, thicker board that lets him wedge his arms into straps and lie down. He then lets go of a string in his mouth, which is attached to a quick release mechanism for the tow rope behind the jet ski. No longer able to travel the world and chase the big waves – this is the next best thing for D'Vorak. ‘What we do defines who we are a bit, so to lose that and be able to get a taste of it back again was pretty special,’ he said. D'Vorak is an incomplete quadraplegic, with limited skin sensation, but has some movement in his shoulders, biceps and left arm tricep. He now gives talks at schools and workplaces about the dangers of spinal injury, and encouraging people to make the most of their lives.

"Germany coach Joachim Low said he will be packing as many attacking midfielders and forwards as possible into his lineup for their Euro 2016 qualifier against minnows Gibraltar on Friday. The Germans are third in Group D after a below-par start to the campaign following their World Cup win in July and Low said it was crucial to finish the year on a high against Gibraltar and European champions Spain, who they face in a friendly on November 18. 'We are not satisfied, neither me, nor the team because we have too few points,' Low told reporters on Thursday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Germany training ahead of Euro 2016 qualifying clash vs Gibraltar . Germany coach Joachim Low watches on during his side's training session in Nuremberg on Thursday . 'So we logically expect a win, not only reflected by the result but also by the way we will play. 'There will be many attacking players on the pitch tomorrow. We don't need four defenders at the back. We need players to set the tone up front,' he added. 'We do not talk about records. If we play our game tomorrow as we expect then we will score several goals. How many goals, I don't know but we want a big score, worthy of a World Cup winner.' Low shouts some instructions to his side as Toni Kroos (left) and Mario Gotze (right) listen in . This will be bad news for Gibraltar, a team made up of mainly amateur players who are policemen, firefighters and customs officers by profession. Gibraltar, a British overseas territory which borders the southern tip of Spain, was accepted as a UEFA member after a 14-year battle during which it faced fierce opposition from Spain. The team played their first international in September. The Germans, four-time World Cup winners, have managed just one win from their three qualifying games, losing to Poland and drawing with Ireland following a narrow opening win against Scotland. John O'Shea's late strike rescued a point for the Republic of Ireland against Germany in October . Low admitted World Cup euphoria had lifted them up high before they crashed back down to the football reality with their bad start to the Euro 2016 qualification. 'We were given this cloud of invincibility after the World Cup but crashed back down hard on reality,' he said. 'We are and will remain the world champions. But we have to learn to leave the past in the past.

"Blackpool airport is facing closure unless a new buyer can be found. The regional airport will cease operation of commercial flights one week after the deadline of October 7 if no agreement is reached, its owners announced on Monday. Three airlines - Jet2, Stobart Air and Citywing - use Blackpool, flying to more than a dozen destinations including Tenerife, Lanzarote, Malaga in Spain, Faro in Portugal and Ibiza, as well as Belfast and Dublin. Facing closure: Blackpool airport will cease operation of commercial flights if a new buyer is not found by October 7 - putting 100 jobs in jeopardy . The airport's current owners are engineering company Balfour Beatty, who also own Exeter and Derry airports. The company took over the airport - previously known as Squires Gate - in 2008. A statement on the airport's website said: 'On August 28, 2014, we announced our intention to find a buyer for the airport operating company. 'The airport operations have been making a loss for a number of years and we are currently exploring a number of options in an attempt to secure the future of the airport. 'We regretfully confirm that if no agreement can be reached before October 7 2014 which ensures the viability of its operations, then it is likely that the airport operations will close. 'In this event, we expect that the last commercial flights will take place on Wednesday October 15 2014. Regional hub: Three airlines - Jet2 (pictured), Stobart Air and Citywing - use Blackpool . 'We apologise for the uncertainty this will cause over the coming weeks and we recommend that any affected passengers contact their airline to confirm travel arrangements.""

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has predicted it will ‘take a long time’ for local rivals Manchester City to be regarded as one of Europe’s super-clubs. On the eve of his first Manchester derby, Van Gaal gave former player Peter Schmeichel’s assertion that City were now a bigger club than United short shrift — despite them being the current Premier League title holders. Van Gaal claims United’s worldwide appeal will always mean they are considered a bigger club than City. Louis van Gaal believes it will 'take a long time' for Manchester City to be regarded as a super-club . Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal (left) enjoys a joke with midfielder Darren Fletcher on Friday . Juan Mata, Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney, Ander Herrera and Robin van Persie (left to right) train . ‘I think so because abroad we have more fans, and followers on social media,’ said the Dutchman. ‘It’s also the same thing for Bayern Munich being the biggest club of Germany, the same thing for Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain. ‘It takes a long time for Manchester City to reach that level, I think.’ United say that market research indicates they have 659 million supporters globally, though there is always debate about how such figures are produced. Van Gaal’s immediate concern, though, is winning at The Etihad Stadium. Despite spending £158million on new players in the last transfer window, United are yet to win an away game, failing to overcome Burnley, Sunderland, MK Dons, Leicester City or West Brom. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero takes part in training on Saturday . (left to right) Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, James Milner, Fernandinho and Edin Dzeko train on Saturday . Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure wears a snood to keep warm during training on Saturday . The Dutchman admits he is perplexed by it as he takes his team across town. ‘There is no reason for it but they are the facts and it should not be like that,’ Van Gaal conceded. ‘The only game we lost was at Leicester and that was a special because of the referee’s decisions. We’ve drawn the other games and we could have won, it’s small margins. We only lost out in height which made it difficult at set-plays. Maybe you can advise me to buy tall players.’ So will Vincent Kompany and Edin Dzeko be a threat today? ‘City have scored only one out of a set-play, less than us,’ said Van Gaal dismissively. Wayne Rooney will return from suspension to captain United for the first time in the derby. On-loan striker Radamel Falcao is still missing, though United insist his injury is not related to his long-term knee problem.","Man United boss believes local rivals are not one of Europe's super clubs .

"It is a temptation to which most male motorists have surely succumbed. But for Doug Maclean, taking his eye off the road to steal a glance at an attractive female pedestrian has landed him with a £60 fine – after his sneaky look was caught on police camera. Officers said he was driving without due care and attention, but the 26-year-old complained: ‘Nicking another bloke for looking at a pretty girl is no way to earn a living.’ 'The girl was a cracker': Doug Maclean (pictured)  has been fined £60 after being pulled over by police for taking his eye off the road to steal a glance at an attractive female pedestrian as he drove past . He added: ‘The girl had a very nice backside and I wanted to check out her face to see if it was as nice  as her figure. It’s what practically every bloke on the planet would do.’ Mr Maclean admits that the photographic evidence shows him leaning over and staring out of the back  window, having driven past the good-looking stranger – but he insists he was in full control of his car. He said: ‘I saw a police car parked about 150 yards down the road but  I didn’t think anything of it as the road was empty and I was in complete control of my vehicle as far as I was concerned. I wasn’t leaning out of the window shouting and wolf-whistling either.’ Nevertheless, he attracted the attention of the officers stationed on the Ibstone Road at Stokenchurch, Buckinghamshire, who pulled him over and showed him the image they had taken from their dashboard camera. Head-turner: Mr Maclean said he was always in full control of his car while catching a glance at the woman (not pictured) ‘It was a really high-quality picture of me leaning across the seat of my vehicle,’ he said. ‘They said that my behaviour constituted driving without due care and attention. ‘They told me that if I agreed, I could have a fixed penalty fine and would have to attend four hours of driving awareness courses. Otherwise I would be summonsed and then I’d get points on my licence too. Of course, I took the fixed penalty and the driving course. ‘Unless you’re wealthy and have the resources to challenge these things you just have to go with  the flow.’ Mr Maclean, a gunsmith, added: ‘The girl was a cracker, but it wasn’t worth getting a £60 fine for.’ However, he claimed that it was ‘a matter of opinion’ whether his actions were dangerous, saying: ‘I would argue that I can do two things at once and am an experienced driver. They would argue that they’re keeping death off the road.’ He added that the object of his  attention ‘must have walked past while I was being reprimanded –  though I wasn’t looking at her by then. If she realised what happened  I expect she had a good laugh.’ Mr Maclean also claimed one of  the policemen had been distracted  by the woman. ‘While they were doing the paperwork one of them, who seemed more human than the other, said something like, “I had a good look at her too. She was a bit of a cracker.” ‘ “There you go,” I said. “You had a bit of a look at her as well – why shouldn’t I?” ‘ “He wasn’t driving,” said the other one, who was having a bit of a break from his sense of humour.’ After the incident, Mr Maclean posted on his Facebook page: ‘Camera footage was good – me looking across and out back window getting a good eyeful.’ One of his friends responded: ‘That’ll teach you for being a dirty old perv then, eh?’ A Thames Valley police spokesman said: ‘We haven’t processed this penalty notice yet so we cannot comment on this particular incident. ‘However, we would remind motorists they have a duty not to be distracted by anything at all, not just gorgeous people, and so lose concentration while they are driving.’","Doug Maclean admits getting a 'good eyeful' of the attractive pedestrian .

"Alastair Cook trudged back to the Trent Bridge pavilion the other evening with his mind in turmoil and his face set in stone. Dismissed for a pittance, one more anti-climax to add to a lengthening list. He tried to disguise his desperation, but his anxiety was all too evident. A game which had once come so easily to him was now posing intractable problems. He was acutely aware that around the ground, around the entire country, his professional future was being urgently discussed. And nowhere more than in the broadcasting boxes, high in the grandstand, where the ancients sat in judgment. A few were stern, most were sympathetic, but all had captained England and all were employed to express their opinions. And so we heard from Sir Ian Botham and David Gower, Michael Atherton and Bob Willis, Nasser Hussain, Alec Stewart, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss. And we knew, beyond question, that before the day was done Cook would become sharply aware of their increasing disillusion with their hapless successor. As any of the people on that list could tell him, such is the lot of the captain of England. Downcast: Alastair Cook trudges off after his cheap first-innings dismissal . Now it is difficult to sympathise with a sublimely gifted athlete of 29 years, a man at the peak of his sporting powers. Yet when we consider the immensity of Cook’s problems, a measure of sympathy is irresistible. His batting is one thing; while his current form may be bleak, a record of 25 Test centuries and some 8,000 Test runs at an average of 45 is evidence of exceptional pedigree. The good days will surely return; it is merely a matter of time. But the captaincy is a different matter altogether; not so much a job, more an office. The skipper of the England football team is not burdened by comparable responsibilities. The armband is lightly exchanged when a muscle tweaks or a substitution is effected; seniority tends to be the main criterion, leadership skill a desirable extra. By comparison, the cricket captain is a man apart; appointed by the game’s elders and anointed by the Establishment. He is expected to possess professional excellence and social assurance, the tact of a diplomat and the patience of a saint. He should be an inspirational leader, a sagacious tactician, a father-confessor and an occasional whipping boy. And, above and beyond all that, he must score Test centuries and win Test series. England expects. Of course, such expectations are thoroughly impertinent, given the shameful paucity of cricket in State schools and the diminishing public support for the county game. But excuses will not be accepted. And so Cook must cope with the twin pressures of his own currently uncertain form and the recurring crises of the side in his charge. He must attempt to forge something formidable from a team that have been too swiftly stripped of too many important players. In bad nick: Cook has not plundered a century since May of last year . And he must endure the absurd distractions of Kevin Pietersen and his sycophantic retinue, as well as the irksome inanities of Shane Warne, a man who continues to resent the fact that he was never entrusted with the Test captaincy of Australia. For a moment, just before the start of this series, Cook allowed himself a brief, exasperated protest at Warne’s provocations, but by and large his self- control has been admirable. Unlike his principal critics, the captain has never actively pursued celebrity. While his face is familiar, his voice is rarely heard in public and even then he tends to restrict himself to conventional, media-trained phrases: ‘We’re at the start of a cycle … great honour to lead the team …  pride of wearing the three Lions.’ He sees every phrase as a hostage to fortune. And yet there is an appealing decency about the man. His private life is properly protected, he never feels the need to seek out a cheap headline and — most important by far — his players are clearly eager to perform for him. Following a skipper as distinguished as Strauss was never going to be easy, but those close to the scene detect signs that Cook is growing into the job. Public patience will be required, especially at a time when it is challenged by adverse events. And Cook’s own patience must not fray, even though Warne, having found a populist theme, is unlikely to keep quiet, while Pietersen will publicly prattle whenever his chums remember to jerk his strings. Yet the sense is that he will come through, that there really is something in the cliché which dictates that form is temporary but class is permanent. Uncertain start: Peter Moores' second era began with a first home Test defeat to Sri Lanka . One big innings may be all that it takes; one long, fluent, utterly productive performance, which sees the head still, the feet moving instinctively and the ball flying off the middle of the bat. And the hope must be that the day will soon arrive. For our finest sportsmen are awarded lavish measures of fame, wealth and public adulation. But from time to time, there is a price to be paid in return. Alastair Cook was paying that price at Trent Bridge. And his suffering offered one of the most poignant images of an English summer. In a tone normally reserved for State funerals, the television reporter announced: ‘Tonight, Brazil is a nation in mourning’. And what savage catastrophe had prompted that assertion? The national team had lost a football match. True, they had been rather heavily beaten in undignified circumstances and a measure of indignation was in order. But ‘mourning’ — defined as the expression of sorrow for somebody’s death — was a grotesque exaggeration. We have all done it, of course. We have all described a missed penalty as a tragedy or an own goal as a disaster, so that when we are visited by real tragedy, real disaster, we have no adequate vocabulary. The torrents of tears, the synthetic hysteria, the ludicrous ‘end of the world’ inquests; they are all evidence of our failure to separate the make-believe of sport from the reality of everyday existence. On their knees: David Luiz and Luis Gustavo were disconsolate following a crushing defeat to Germany . And yet, the sporting week held an even more preposterous piece of hyperbole. A few days ago, there were some distressing spills in the Tour de France. One poor chap went over his handlebars, another finished up in a ditch, while Chris Froome, last year’s champion, was forced to withdraw after a couple of damaging crashes. The Garmin–Sharp team manager, one Jonathan Vaughters, described it as ‘absolute war’. This, of a stage which set off from the town of Ypres. Luis Suarez has failed in an appeal against his four–month ban from football. The appeal was supported by the Uruguay FA, who argued that his conviction was unsafe due to ‘lack of evidence’. It was a bold ploy, which might easily have succeeded but for the teeth-shaped scars on the shoulder of Giorgio Chiellini, along with the eye–witness evidence of 39,706 people in the stadium as well as millions of television viewers across the planet. Suarez (above, after joining Barcelona) is said to be preparing a new appeal. He is claiming mistaken identity. Unmistakeable: Luis Suarez joined Barcelona with a trademark grin . The great ones, the best who ever played the game, tend to own a World Cup winner’s medal. Pele, Maradona, Moore, Beckenbauer; it is an illustrious list. Now Germany’s improvement in this tournament has been genuinely dramatic, and their destruction of Brazil was a performance for the ages. They would be worthy world champions. Yet when we look again at that list, there is one name which demands admission. I dearly hope to see Lionel Messi joining the pantheon at the Maracana. Cometh the hour: Will Lionel Messi join the immortals as Argentina chase a third World Cup win .","Alastair Cook's future as England captain is in jeopardy .

"Two or three lifetimes ago, the satirists Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller performed a sketch which mocked the military mindset. Cook, as the Squadron Leader, addressed ‘Flying Officer Perkins’, played by Miller: ‘I want you to lay down your life, Perkins. We need a futile gesture at this stage. It’ll raise the whole tone of the war. Get up in a crate, Perkins. Pop over to Bremen. Take a shufti. Don’t come back. Goodbye, Perkins. God, I wish I was going too.’ Miller: ‘Goodbye, Sir —  or is it au revoir? Cook: ‘No, Perkins. Goodbye.’ VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Ashton and Sale: There should be an FA inquiry . Stellar talent: Jonathan Miller (left) lines up alongside Alan Bennett, Dudley Moore and Peter Cook . Disaster zone: Roy Hodgson took control of a disastrous World Cup . Roy Hodgson is of the vintage which remembers Cook and Miller, and after the past week he will certainly recognise their message. England have just endured a disastrously truncated World Cup so a facile, totally futile gesture is demanded. Hodgson must go! Sack the manager. Why, it’ll appease the rabble and raise the tone. Now I realise that there are armies of armchair generals who could have done an infinitely better job than the current England manager. True, they may never have been required to pick a team or command the professional respect of a diverse group of young millionaires. No matter, given the time and the facilities, any one of those amateurs could have created a team capable of beating the world. And if they couldn’t, then they know a man who could. But Hodgson failed to land a trophy which England won as recently as 1966, so Hodgson must go. Yet who should replace him? Who would be guaranteed to do a better job with the players available? Who, in short, would be capable of satisfying England’s absurdly inflated expectations? After all, the alternatives to Hodgson are not queuing around the block. And the field is narrowed still further by the Football Association’s apparent insistence that the manager of England should be English. So who does that leave us with? Steve Bruce? — not really. Alan Pardew? — not a hope. Sam Allardyce — don’t be silly. But wait! Who is that standing offstage, frantically demanding attention? Why, it’s Harry Redknapp; the renowned sage, raconteur and media darling with a quote for all occasions. Redknapp has made no secret of his conviction that he should have had the England job. You will recall his sneer at Hodgson: ‘Sometimes one face fits and another doesn’t. Simple as that... I think we can all see that he is more of an FA man... he ticks the FA’s boxes as England manager just fine.’ The envy was too blatant, the derision too crude. Revelations: Harry Redknapp made assertions about unnamed Spurs players who wanted to shirk international duty . He also claimed that several England players, including Steven Gerrard, had sent him texts saying they would love him to manage England. Gerrard denied it, crushingly. ‘I’ve never had his personal number,’ he said. Yet the old chap is not easily discouraged and he was at it again last week, choosing a moment when Hodgson was at his lowest ebb  to impugn the loyalty of England  footballers. ‘I can tell you, when I was at Tottenham when full internationals came around, there were two or three players who did not want to play for England,’ he said. ‘They would come to me 10 days before the game and say, “Gaffer, get me out of that game, I don’t want to play in that game”. I’d say, “You’re playing for your country, you should want to play”. And that is the truth, so it makes you wonder.’ Once again Gerrard, who is the wrong man to upset, came down on him like a ton of bricks. ‘I’d be interested to find out who those players are,’ said the England captain. ‘If Harry is making a comment like that, he should name them and embarrass them... no one has said to me they don’t like playing for England or that they don’t want to be here. They didn’t want to play for England. Who? Name them. We need names.’ Straight talking: Steven Gerrard asked for names to be named . Needless to say, Redknapp retreated in unseemly haste: ‘I don’t want to get into naming names because it wouldn’t be fair to the players,’ he babbled. The fact that he had smeared the dozen England players who worked under him at Spurs was apparently irrelevant. Such is the kind of malevolent nonsense which Hodgson has to endure, and while sympathy is too much to expect, a certain understanding might be in order. For a talented man of substantial achievement is now lazily reduced to a designated whipping boy; a national pin-cushion. Truly, there are times when the futile gesture seems not so much a punishment, more a merciful option. When the outrage and uproar subsided, all were agreed that the fangs of Luis Suarez had provided the most compelling image of this World Cup so far. And the delicious reactions to his assault only added spice to the story. Uruguay opted for blank denial. ‘I didn’t see him bite anyone,’ said President Jose Mujica. The national captain, Diego Lugano, was equally brazen. ‘What incident?’ he asked. ‘I don’t know what incident you’re talking about. Have you got something against Luis?’ They were supported by the philosopher Joey Barton, who twittered: ‘He’s a winner. If that means he occasionally steps over the line between right and wrong, than that’s what comes with the territory.’ Daddy fool: Luis Suarez is back at home with his children after his World Cup disgrace . I suspect our Joseph’s attempts to be taken seriously have not been advanced by that little effort.In the opposing camp, Danny Mills offered a radical remedy. Sounding that note of cool reason, which has made him such an invaluable member of Greg Dyke’s estimable commission, he announced: ‘They have got to throw him in jail and lock him up for ever.’ That’ll teach him. But the cruellest cut was inflicted by the online betting firm 888poker, for whom Suarez was an ‘official worldwide ambassador’. First, they declared: ‘We will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’ Then, following the FIFA ban, the company announced, more in sorrow than in anger: ‘888poker has decided to terminate its relationship with Luis Suarez with immediate effect.’ So it’s official: Suarez has become too tacky, even for a bunch of online gamblers. I fear there can be no way back. Shame: Wonga sponsor Newcastle . Wonga, the notorious payday lender, has been ordered to pay £2.6million in compensation after sending threatening letters from fictitious law firms to customers in arrears. Not only were the firms invented but in some cases Wonga actually charged the customers fees for the fraudulent letters. The intention was to pressurise people in arrears by making them believe their debt had been passed on to a law firm, who threatened legal action if the debt was not paid. Clive Anderson, of the Financial Conduct Authority, said: ‘Wonga’s misconduct was very serious as it had the effect of exacerbating an already difficult situation for customers in arrears.’ Richard . Lloyd, executive director of the consumer magazine Which?, described it . as ‘a shocking new low for the payday industry’. Meanwhile, Newcastle’s . famous black and white stripes are still contaminated by the Wonga name . as they continue their four-year, £32m sponsorship. The . reason for Wonga’s targeting of Newcastle is as obvious as it is . cynical; the North-East has the highest rate of personal insolvency in . the country and the area contains a disproportionate number of the poor, . the vulnerable and the desperate. Chi Onwurah, the local MP, summed it . up. ‘Some of the richest young men in Newcastle are wearing shirts . calling on the poorest to go to a legal loan shark,’ she said. But will this latest evidence produce a change of mind? Will a wealthy club discover a conscience, forego the tarnished money and restore a measure of decent dignity to the grand old shirt? I suspect we know the answer. The rumours are so strong, they may even be true: Barcelona are attempting to sign Luis Suarez. Apparently unconcerned by his four-month ban and his appalling reputation, they are preparing to take him to the Nou Camp. Barcelona represents just about everything that is good in the game, from their insistence on playing the purest form of football, to their treatment of the fans, to their deep respect for their own traditions. Now they are dallying with a serial biter. We thought they were better than that. Let’s hope we were right.","England have just endured a disastrously truncated World Cup so a facile, totally futile gesture is demanded .

"Former Manchester United manager David Moyes will be announced as the new boss of La Liga side Real Sociedad on Sunday, according to reports in Spain. Moyes. who was sacked by the Red Devils in April after less than a season in charge at Old Trafford, was given a tour of the Basque club earlier this week and held talks on Friday. Spanish newspaper AS now claim that Moyes has decided to relaunch his managerial career with Sociedad but Sportsmail understands that he remains unsure about taking the job and is set to make a decision on Sunday. Former Manchester United manager David Moyes was given a tour of Real Sociedad on Friday night . Moyes' reign at Old Trafford lasted just 10 months as the Scotsman failed to get the best out of his players . Sociedad, where Wales manager Chris Coleman was once in charge, have turned to Moyes after a disastrous start to their La Liga campaign which has left them with just six points from 10 games. But the potential at a club which gets regular gates of 24,000-plus and was in the Champions League a year ago might be enough to persuade Moyes he has found the right opportunity to start again. He told Sportsmail recently: ‘I’d like to find a job, if I can, that gives me a chance of being successful. ‘I have always felt it could enhance me as a manager to go abroad, so that is a possibility.’ Real Sociedad are looking for a new manager after Jagoba Arrasate was relieved of his duties .

"Liverpool will make a last-ditch attempt to persuade Ashley Cole to join them. But Cole, who was left out of England’s World Cup squad, is poised to leave the Premier League and move to Serie A. Roma hope to rubber stamp a deal with the ex-England left-back next week. Curtain call: Ashley Cole's Chelsea career came to an end when the last Premier League season finished . There could be a new wave of Costa Rican players on their way to the Premier League after their great showing at the World Cup and the involvement of English agency Sillsport. Arsenal are taking Joel Campbell back from his loan spell in Greece, although the Gunners could farm him out again and other Costa Ricans have attracted the eye of English scouts. Three years ago Sillsport set up a fund to invest in several South and Central American clubs to help develop young players in return for an eventual return on their transfer fees. Out to impress: Joel Campbell trains on Friday ahead of Costa Rica's semi-final against Holland . The company has developed a strong relationship with former West Ham striker Paolo Wanchope who is the Costa Rica assistant coach and the company has a major tie-up with several clubs in Costa Rica. A number of players are now looking to capitalise on Costa Rica’s success at the World Cup this summer by securing moved to club’s in England or Spain. Arsenal are poised to sign Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle this this week. The Gunners believe they have an £8m deal in the bag for the France right-back who will take over from Bacary Sagna after his move to Manchester City. Indeed Debuchy claimed in TV interview after France’s defeat to Germany that he ‘will be playing for Arsenal next season.’ Target: Arsenal are believed to be close to completing an £8million deal for France's Debuchy (right) I am hearing . While Frank Lampard has snubbed his uncle and QPR manager Harry to instead turn out for Melbourne City ahead his move to MLS club New York City, Rio Ferdinand is poised to agree a move to Loftus Road. Ferdinand has been playing a return to the London area for some time when he knew he wouldn’t get a new deal at Manchester United. A luxury mansion on the Farnborough Park estate on the south east London/Kent border near the M25 is close to being fully renovated. Done deal: Rio Ferdinand is set to sign for QPR when he returns from Brazil . I am also hearing . Ashley Young is one of several players on the way out of Manchester United and could move back to Aston Villa. Swansea and Newcastle are two other possible destinations. Southampton want £25m to sell Dejan Lovren to Liverpool. The Saints have already rejected a £20m offer from the Reds. But they want more although it is possible they will consider one of the several squad players Liverpool have on offer as part of an exchange deal. Why didn’t someone come up with ‘shaving foam’ idea at free kicks  years ago? It’s so simple and so effective. It is hoped it will be adopted in the Premier League this season. Marouane Fellaini will be shown the door by Manchester United as soon as new boss Louis Van Gaal gets his feet under the table. Everton, who sold Fellaini to United for £27m last summer, will be interested in taking the Belgium midfielder back; but only in a cut price deal at around £12m. The player would also have to agree to a compromise over his basic salary.Newcastle would also be interested. Boost: Belgium's Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed something of a renaissance at World Cup . Newcastle are also set to make a move for Manchester City’s Micah Richards. Richards played just two Premier League matches for City last season and has been told he can leave after the arrival of Bacary Sagna from Arsenal. The 26-year-old has one year of his contract remaining and could be bought for as little as £5 million. Young USA right-back DeAndre Yedlin, who came on as an early substitute in their defeat to Belgium, has attracted the attention of several Premier League clubs after his superb performance. And the 20-year-old, who is currently at Seattle Sounders, could secure a move to Liverpool if he impresses during a pre-season trial. Wanted: USA right-back DeAndre Yedlin has attracted the attention of Premier League clubs . Mon: Astonishingly, Luis Suraez comes out and protests his innocence. The utter absence of remorse should have persuaded FIFA to double his suspension. Tues: At last Suarez makes a form of apology but it’s just a cynical way of keeping his move to Barcelona alive. Who would have thought it? Belgium’s 2-1 win over the USA turns out to be one of the all-time World Cup classics. Weds: Barcelona officials fly into London and start formal talks with Liverpool about buying Suarez who was off to Spain before his biting incident anyway. But Liverpool have had to take a cut on the £100m they wanted with the cash sum dropping close to £60 million. Thurs: Former England Under 21 boss Stuart Pearce slams Roy Hodgson for not blooding players properly via the Under 21 set-up; he's right. Fri: It wasn’t pretty as Brazil bruised their way in to the semi-final by beating Columbia 2-1. But with Neymar now out Germany have the ability and the mental toughness to beat the hosts in the last four. Libero . Glenn Hoddle has said he no longer wants to see Brazil win the World Cup because they are not playing Jogo Bonito. He has a point. With Neymar now out they lack Samba stars in the grand tradition. Ironically Germany, who they now face in the semi-finals, used to pride themselves on grinding out results like Brazil have but now play the more expansive football. In that respect, if this tournament is to be remembered as one of the best ever then I suspect Hoddle would like to see Germany beat Brazil then lift the trophy for the first time since 1990. That was one of the dullest-ever tournaments, England’s great exploits apart of course. In many ways I agree. It might seem romantic for Brazil to win a sixth World Cup in Rio next week but not if the imprint they leave is bruises not Samba soccer. Mind you, the free kick David Luiz scored against Colombia was in the grand tradition of Pele, Rivelino, Zico and Co. But the world really would seem upside down if a Brazilian centre half turns out to be their World Cup hero. Stunning: Brazil defender David Luiz strikes an unstoppable free-kick into the top corner of the net . Set piece: Thiago Silva and Colombia keeper David Opsina look on as Brazil take the lead on Friday . Substance over style for a sixth star: Some believe Brazil are abandoning the style that made them great... particularly in the World Cup in 1970, which they won with a 4-1 victory over Italy . BTW . David Dein hit the nail on the head the other day when he said one of the problems of developing young talent in England  is because there is less and less sport in school, especially outside school hours. There are several reasons for that. One of them is the academy system at big clubs . One of the many down sides of the academies is that they draw talent away from school, district and county teams which used to be a route to the top for many players. Big Phil Scolari has told all the critics he has faced that they ‘can go to hell’. Foot on the ball, Phil. The Brazilian public will not take kindly to their romantic vision of football being revised and if he continues to go completely against the Samba spirit he could be the first manager to win a World Cup and be sacked within days. Back Heel . Since 1930 there have been 56 scorers in World Cup finals. Thirty five of them are still alive. Celebrated photographer Michael Donald managed to track them down over the last few years and has compiled an amazing collection of portraits of Pele, Martin Peters and so on but of course not Diego Maradona or Johann Cruyff. They are currently being exhibited at the trendy bar/gallery The Proud Archivist which is in Haggerston, London just up to road from Hoxton. Back of the net: Since 1930 there have been 56 scorers in World Cup finals, including Pele in 1970 . If you are in the area it’s a must visit. There is also a great Panini exhibition there too. The unique collection will be up for auction soon and it is believed the collection could fetch over £100,000. That sounds a lot but not when you think Tracey Emin’s bedroom installation art ‘classic’ is supposedly worth over £2m.","Liverpool will make an 11th-hour attempt to persuade Ashley Cole to join .

"Japan coach Javier Aguirre picked out Keisuke Honda for special praise after the playmaker underlined his worth to the team with a goal and two assists in the Asian champions' 6-0 thrashing of Honduras in a friendly. Maya Yoshida, Yasuhito Endo and substitutes Takashi Inui, who scored a brace, and Yohei Toyoda were the other scorers on Friday night as Japan got a boost of confidence ahead of January's Asian Cup in Australia. 'He's very motivated,' the Mexican coach was quoted as saying by Japan's Kyodo news agency. 'I think he's started to realise that (out) of all our players who play abroad, he is the most important.' Javier Aguirre noted that out of all Japan players who play abroad, Keisuke Honda is the 'most important' The Blue Samurai playmaker was on brilliant form against the Hondurans, scoring once and assisting two . '(Shinji) Kagawa is also very important, but Honda is the bar of our team. I've been working with him for three months now, and I know what he's thinking just by making eye contact.' The win was welcome relief for the home crowd after Japan lost 4-0 in a friendly against Brazil in Singapore last month. Honda scored Japan's second goal after latching on to a clearance from midfield and placing the ball deftly past the goalkeeper. He then set up Endo and Inui for the third and fourth goals with defence-splitting passes. 'We started the game really well,' Honda said. 'The important thing is to keep this going (for the Asian Cup). 'The national team needs to be made up of aspiring players and we always need to be on our toes. We can't let up.' Honda (left) celebrates with his Japan team-mates following one of Takashi Inui's goals against Honduras . Honduras will next face China, who also warmed up for the Asian Cup with a 1-1 draw against New Zealand. Captain Zheng Zhi gave China the lead before half time with a dipping volley from outside the box but the All Whites forced a draw through a header from Chris Wood in the 87th minute. 'We played with a very young and physical side ... and I think to play with this kind of style is a good thing for our team,' China coach Alain Perrin was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency. 'We may meet teams with similar style in the Asian Cup, so it's helpful for the team. In the first half we created a lot of chances, but we need to improve our efficiency.'

"England battled brilliantly against New Zealand at Eden Park on Saturday, but were just pipped to the post as the All Blacks made a late comeback to win 20-15. Here, Sportsmail's World Cup winning coach Sir Clive Woodward rates the two teams and gives his verdict on which England players deserve to start next week's second Test. ENGLAND . Mike Brown - 7Not his stellar best, often double tackled, but strong and feisty. VERDICT: Must start in Dunedin . Strength: Mike Brown wasn't at his best, but was a constant source of power for England . Marland Yarde - 7 . Tidy all-round game but rightly yellow carded late in second half. VERDICT: Did enough to stay in . Manu Tuilagi - 8 . Looks fit, fresh and hungry. Big threat to New Zealand defence. VERDICT: I want him on left wing . Kyle Eastmond - 7 . Some really nice touches, laid down a marker for the future. VERDICT: Billy Twelvetrees if fit . Too strong: Manu Tuilagi (centre) is stopped by the All Black defence during the Test match . Jonny May - 6 . Curate’s egg. Some good moments, must adapt to Test pace. VERDICT: Move Tuilagi to the wing . Freddie Burns - 7 . Composed, kicked his goals and justified Lancaster’s confidence. VERDICT: Farrell to start if fit . In the mix: Both Kyle Eastmond and Freddie Burns were in impressive form at Eden Park . Ben Youngs - 6 . Busy against top opponent. Second fumble nearly cost England dear. VERDICT: Danny Care returns if fit . Substitutes - 7 . Not a massive factor but Cipriani got on the front foot and kicked his penalty with aplomb. Joe Marler - 7 . Solid evening’s work and that short fuse seemed well under control. VERDICT: Good to go again . Battle: Joe Marler (centre) is tackled by Liam Messam (left) and Richie McCaw during England's defeat . Rob Webber - 7 . A standout effort. Good in the tight and line-out, extra option in loose. VERDICT: Dylan Hartley to return . David Wilson - 6 . Strong in scrum but oddly prone to fumbles for a good handler. VERDICT: Good to go again . Joe Launchbury - 7 . Good in the line-out, worked with calm efficiency. So reliable. VERDICT: One of the first names on the team sheet . Safe hands: Joe Launchbury was strong in the line-out on Saturday . Geoff Parling - 7 . Fine return after long time out of Tests. Ran line-out intelligently. VERDICT: Lawes to come back . James Haskell - 7 . Finished strongly for Wasps and maintained that form here. VERDICT: Tom Wood is first choice . Chris Robshaw (capt) - 8 . One of his best performances - and against McCaw as well. VERDICT: Will lead from front again . Ben Morgan - 7 . Very fine effort, carried very well and gave England go-forward. VERDICT: ...but Vunipola returns . Leader: England skipper Chris Robshaw (centre) put in one of his best performances . NEW ZEALAND . Israel Dagg - 6 . One slashing run in attack but unusually error-prone for such a quality player. Ben Smith - 7 . Made up for earlier handling errors with that brilliant try-scoring pass at the death. Conrad Smith - 8 . The old head knew exactly what was required in the 79th minute to score his try. Experienced: Conrad Smith scored the crucial 79th minute try for New Zealand . Ma’a Nonu - 6 . Not at his best by any means. Should have been yellow-carded for shirt-tugging early on. Cory Jane - 6 . Quiet night, few chances to shine, which is a testament to England’s pressure game. Aaron Cruden - 7 . Not without error but a very accomplished stand-in for the resting Dan Carter. Aaron Smith - 8 . Livewire, clever kicker, speedy delivery. New Zealand’s best player on the night. Star man: Aaron Smith of the All Blacks was one of the best players on the pitch at Eden Park . Tony Woodcock - 6 . Veteran World Cup-winning prop but England had the better of the front-row exchanges. Dane Coles - 6 . Has bulked up but still struggling at scrum time. New Zealand scrum improved when he departed. Owen Franks - 6 . Had his hands full in the tight and not seen in the loose as much as usual. Missing: Dane Coles (centre) struggled to impose himself when it came to scrum time . Brodie Retallick - 7 . Made that long second-half break and considerable line-out force. Good player. Sam Whitelock - 7 . Unsung workhorse as ever but tough going against an aggressive England pack. Stopped: England managed Richie McCaw well and kept the New Zealand captain relatively quiet . Liam Messam - 6 . Came second-best to England at the tackle area. Could drop out if Read returns. Richie McCaw (capt) - 7 . Quiet by his immense standards. England power at breakdown helped negate him. Jerome Kaino - 7 . Not a natural No 8. Great athlete and driving force - but at blindside flanker.","England captain Chris Robshaw was at his very best against New Zealand .

"Graham Alexander led Fleetwood to a Sky Bet League Two play-off final at Wembley and then challenged them to make history by achieving their sixth promotion in 10 seasons. The Cod Army, reformed for the second time in 1997, beat York 1-0 on aggregate - following Friday night's 0-0 draw at Highbury - and now have the chance to enter uncharted waters by reaching the third tier of English football. That is where the likes of Preston, who Alexander played for over 350 times, and Sheffield United will be competing next season but the ambitious outfit from the north-west coast have the financial backing befitting a club at such a level. One more step: Graham Alexander has challenged his Fleetwood side to earn their sixth promotion in 10 seasons . Special day: Jon Parkin is congratulated by fans after helping Fleetwood to the League Two play-off final . After missing out on a top-three spot, Fleetwood now have the chance to join promoted sides Chesterfield, Scunthorpe and Rochdale in League One, a berth Alexander insists they deserve. 'I'm really happy - to get to Wembley is the next step that we wanted to take, it's not the goal, it's not the target, but it's the next step,' the former Scotland international said. 'York made it hard for us for at nil-nil. It was end-to-end and a proper play-off game and we're pleased we got there.' The hosts had to weather considerable storms to record their second straight clean sheet, meaning Matty Blair's goal four days ago in Yorkshire settled the semi-final over the two legs. Fleetwood's man of the match was central defender Nathan Pond, who is in his testimonial year and has been with the team for each of their previous five promotions. 'When it came down to the crunch the defenders and the goalkeeper were fantastic over the two legs, especially tonight,' added Alexander. 'It was one for men and that's what we saw out there.' Celebrations: Midfielder Matty Blair is mobbed by fans following Fleetwood's 0-0 draw at home to York . Alexander's side have been close to glory this season and not only narrowly missed out on automatic promotion, but also on a previous Wembley final when they were defeated by Chesterfield in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy area final. 'We deserve to put ourselves in the final because we were the fourth team in the league and highest placed in the play-offs,' argued Alexander. 'It doesn't give you anything but for us, finishing just behind the top three, we deserved it. We earned it over 180 minutes against York and now we've got a very tough game against whoever gets through to the final.' Burton and Southend are the other two sides in the semi-finals, with the former leading 1-0 from the first leg at home. The Minstermen failed to find the net in the tie's 180 minutes but their manager Nigel Worthington admitted his troops gave everything in an open contest. On the attack: Fleetwood Town's Josh Morris has a shot at goal during the goalless draw with York on Friday . 'I thought it was a tremendous effort from start to finish,' he said. 'The energy, commitment - they never stopped. That's the type of group we've had and as the manager of the football club I'm very proud of them. 'Not just tonight, they've done that all season. To come away to a very good side and put on a show like that you've got to be proud. Credit to them.' Although York failed to carve out any clear-cut chances they enjoyed large spells of possession and territorial advantage, yet came up short against a resolute home defence led by Pond. Worthington continued: 'There were many half chances tonight when the ball was in and around the box but it's just got to fall to you. Sometimes you've got to make that; that's about better finishing and being sharper. But Fleetwood are a good side and I wish them well in the final. 'It's disappointing at the moment but you've got to get over that, dust yourself down and get ready for the new season once we've had a holiday.'","Fleetwood reaching League Two play-off final after beating York on aggregate on Friday night .
