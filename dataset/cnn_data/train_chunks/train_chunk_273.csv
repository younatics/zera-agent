"(CNN) -- Justin Legg could dead-lift a washing machine and carry it across the street. He could swim miles on end and run a marathon on one day's notice. The former Navy SEAL stayed in top shape because his life -- and the lives of his teammates -- depended on it. But when his physical strength deteriorated in a fight against cancer, Legg had to rely on his mental fortitude to carry him through four years of excruciating pain, a bone marrow transplant and two collapsed lungs. Finally back on his feet, Legg now has a new mission. He's relearning to run, one step at a time, in honor of the 19-year-old boy who saved his life. Newlywed nightmare . The pain started in his ribs. Legg brushed it off, figuring a martial arts fight had gotten the best of him. He and his new wife, Suzanne, were enjoying their first few months of marital bliss in Louisiana. He was rebuilding their house -- the one that Hurricane Katrina had destroyed -- in between training at a military base in Mississippi. But the pain persisted and his workouts soon started to suffer. ""For me it was pretty easy to run 10, 15 miles,"" Legg says. ""Suddenly I couldn't run five. I got to three and my legs just ground to a halt."" In June 2006, shortly before his 28th birthday, Legg's doctor called and told him that his white blood cell count was elevated. The military sent Legg to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to get checked out. The diagnosis: acute lymphoblastic leukemia. ""My first question was, 'Can I still be a SEAL?'"" Legg remembers. Still in shock, Suzanne was ticked off: ""Not 'My new bride' or 'What's our new life going to be like?' but 'Am I going to be able to roll in the dirt with my friends and blow up things?' My whole world in front of me just went black."" Doctors immediately started Legg on eight straight days of chemotherapy. The drugs had no mercy -- attacking healthy and unhealthy cells alike, weakening his entire body. ""They tell you to take your IV pole and walk a lap around the floor each day to avoid clots,"" Legg says. ""I remember leaning on that IV pole, just draping my arms over top of it just to get around the ward once."" That didn't stop him from doing lunges in the hospital library, using books as weights. In addition to leukemia, doctors discovered Legg had the Philadelphia Chromosome, an abnormality in his genes that caused cancerous cells to duplicate 80 times faster than in other patients. Chemotherapy wasn't going to be enough; he needed a bone marrow transplant. Husband walks streets in search of kidney donor . Attacked from within . Like many SEALs, Legg is a little ""twisted,"" Suzanne says. He's stubborn. Intense. Arrogant. ""If you tell him, 'There's a very low chance that you'll get through this,' well, he knows he can. If you tell him, 'You can't,' he loves to prove you wrong. That's the little cherry on top for him."" She believes that attitude saved him. Legg developed graft-versus-host disease shortly after receiving a bone marrow transplant from a German donor. With graft-vs.-host disease, the new cells attack the recipient's body because they see it as a foreign entity. ""For the first two months I was throwing up every day because my stomach was getting beat up so bad,"" Legg says. He also developed a severe skin condition. Anytime he got warm, hives would break out all over his body. For months, Legg worked out with a mouth guard so he could get through the pain without screaming. In 2007, Legg went back to work and rejoined the SEALs as a platoon commander. He knew his struggle wasn't over, but he was managing the disease. Managing it, that is, until a doctor made a mistake with his medication, causing his symptoms to flare up again. His hands and feet itched like crazy. A mouth full of sores caused any crunchy food to hurt like a razor blade. Cause for more concern was his liver and lungs, which were failing rapidly. By February 2009, it had gotten so bad that he had to resign from his SEAL team. ""That crushed me,"" he says. ""That was everything I had worked for since I was 14 or 15 years old."" And the worst was yet to come. ""I remember the day my lungs collapsed. I remember them putting me on a gurney, calling a code blue, rushing me through the hospital."" Legg slipped into a coma. ""The doctors told me how sick he was, how close to death he was,"" Suzanne says. ""I was just thinking... there is no way Justin can die like this. He will be so PO-ed."" After two weeks, Legg awakened from his coma. For a while, his body seemed OK, but doctors were worried about his chest scans. After everything he had been through, the news that he would need a double lung transplant barely fazed him. ""Death wasn't an option,"" Legg says. ""In my mind, I've always thought that I have the ability to prevent this from happening. I have the ability to fight it off."" He had the operation on July 22, 2010. Back on his feet . Just eight months after his transplant, Legg completed a half marathon. In September 2012, he half-ran, half-walked his second. Working with Team in Training, a fundraising program with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Legg has collected more than $39,000 this year for cancer research. He hopes to raise another $11,000 by running the Disney Wine & Dine half marathon in November. If he reaches his fundraising goal before the end of the year, he'll be allowed to name a research project after his lung donor, 19-year-old Jarred McKinley Carter. ""Jarred abruptly ended his life on July 20, 2010, without knowing what an incredible person he was,"" his mother, Julie McCarthy, told CNN in an e-mail. ""Jarred died believing that he didn't matter, that no one would remember his name... Justin and Jarred are now joined together -- a brotherhood -- on a mission to help others. They endure training together, go on adventures together. My son still lives and breathes."" Legg hopes to meet McCarthy in Florida after the November race. He is reminded every day that he wouldn't be alive if it weren't for her son. Follow Legg's journey on Twitter | Donate to his cause . Legg still struggles to do simple tasks, like mow the lawn or climb stairs. Most lung transplant patients die from complications within five years, a statistic that's always in the back of Suzanne's mind. ""I constantly ask him, 'Are you OK? Are you breathing?' That drives him crazy,"" she says with a laugh. ""(But) if there's one person that can live for 25 years with a new set of lungs, it's going to be him."" For now, the couple is focusing on taking things one step at a time -- all the way to the finish line. Legg strives to follow his SEAL team's motto: Earn Your Trident Everyday. ""You must do something to improve yourself each day,"" he wrote on his blog. ""That doesn't mean just doing what is required. That means stretch your limits a little bit farther than the day before."" For Team in Training, the race isn't about running .","Justin Legg survived leukemia and a double lung transplant .

"(CNN) -- Slumping World No.2 Rory McIlroy and defending champion Luke Donald will not be contesting the weekend action at the European Tour's flagship event at Wentworth. With organizers still reeling from the controversy surrounding Sergio Garcia's ""fried chicken"" jibe, the star attractions comfortably failed to make the halfway cut Friday at the PGA Championship. McIlroy 2013 travails continued as he followed a first round 74 with a 75 to finish on five-over 149 -- three outside the qualification mark. McIlroy's Northern Ireland colleague Graeme McDowell, who is leading the European Tour's Race to Dubai, finished on the same mark, while Donald, who went to No.1 in the rankings last season with his second straight title at the tournament, was a further shot adrift. Donald, who was on antibiotics, may have had an excuse in the freezing wet conditions on the West Course, and battled to a level-par 72 in his second round after a sorry 78 on the first day. But McIlroy, who came into the $6 million event saying he was pleased with his game, could offer little in the way of explanation for his poor showing. ""I didn't play particularly well today,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I'm looking forward to getting back to some golf without four layers. Sometimes when the weather is bad I try to do too much with the ball and hit some bad shots."" Standing four-over on the par-five17th, the U.S. PGA champion needed a birdie or better to get stand a chance of making the final two rounds. A wayward tee shot into the trees led to a double bogey seven and his chances were over. Garcia fared better and remained in contention after a battling 71 for one-under 143, but trails halfway leader Francesco Molinari of Italy by five shots. Molinari's superb four-under 68 in testing conditions has left the Italian Ryder Cup star one shot clear of South Africa's George Coetzee, Scotland's Marc Warren, Mark Foster of England and Spaniard Alejandro Canizares. London-based Molinari said he had adapted to the inclement British weather. ""Six under is a good score given the conditions - I live over here now so I am used to it - and I'm in a great position going into the weekend,"" he told the official European Tour website. ""But it's a really tough course so anyone six or seven behind is still in it."" Other star attractions Lee Westwood and British Open champion Ernie Els were firmly in the picture on three under, the former showing his improved short game around the green on his way to a battling 71. The crowds were also delighted as the oldest man in the event, the ever popular Spanard Miguel Angel Jimenez, made three birdies in the last four holes to finish on one-over 145. European Ryder Cup captains past and present, Colin Montgomerie, Jose-Maria Olazabal and Paul McGinley, who takes charge of the team at Gleneagles next year, also survived for the weekend when the weather forecast is more favorable.","Rory McIlroy misses cut at PGA Championship at Wentworth .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Hours after Turkey and Armenia announced a tentative, Swiss-mediated peace deal, opposition politicians in Turkey were blasting the proposal. Turkish President Abdullah Gul, left, meets Armenian counterpart Serzh Sarkisian in Yerevan in September 2008. The plan would normalize relations and open the common border between the two neighbors. Political analysts warn that there are still immense hurdles left, before Armenians and Turks can overcome nearly a century of bad blood and re-open a border that has been sealed shut for more then fifteen years. In a joint press statement released late Monday night, Switzerland, Armenia and Turkey announced they had agreed to start six weeks of ""internal political consultations"" on two protocols, aimed at establishing diplomatic and bilateral relations. ""The protocol can be signed in six weeks, ratified by the parliament completing the process there and come into force,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said, in an interview to Turkey's NTV news station. ""However it is not known how long the approval process would be."" At least one observer noted the tenuous nature of the deal. ""I don't see it as a breakthrough, because as long as everything is tied to parliamentary approval ... you can always go back to square one,"" said Nigar Goksel, an Istanbul-based analyst with the European Stability Initiative, who has closely followed recent diplomacy between Yerevan and Ankara. The border between Turkey and Armenia has been shut since 1993, after Turkey objected to Armenia's war with Turkish-ally Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabagh. Neither country has embassies in each other's capitals. ""The United States warmly welcomes the joint statement made today by Turkey and Armenia, with Swiss participation, outlining further steps in the normalization of their bilateral relations,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement released Monday. ""It has long been and remains the position of the United States that normalization should take place without preconditions and within a reasonable timeframe. We urge Armenia and Turkey to proceed expeditiously, according to the agreed framework as described in today's statement. ""We remain ready to work closely with both governments in support of normalization, a historic process that will contribute to peace, security and stability throughout the region."" Turkish-Armenian relations are often overshadowed by dispute over the massacre of ethnic Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, more then 90 years ago. Armenians accuse Ottoman Turks of committing genocide, killing more then a million Armenians starting in 1915. Modern-day Turkey vehemently rejects these allegations. The proposed protocol for normalizing relations calls for creating a committee of international experts, to research archives and ""restore mutual confidence between the two nations."" But there is no mention of the disputed territory of Karabagh, which Armenian troops have controlled since the 1993 Armenian-Azerbaijan war. ""In this way Turkey is taking a step back,"" said Onur Oymen, a lawmaker in Turkey's opposition CHP party. He said if the protocols were put to a vote before the Turkish parliament, ""we won't support them. This would damage Turkey's relations with Azerbaijan."" Many observers say the current diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Armenia was made possible by a dramatic round of ""football diplomacy."" In September 2008, Turkish president Abdullah Gul accepted an invitation to attend a soccer match with Armenia's newly-elected president in the Armenian capital. But in interviews, Armenian President Serge Sarkisian has said he wants Turkey to make progress towards re-opening the border, before agreeing to attend a follow-up round of football diplomacy, at a soccer match scheduled to take place in the Turkish city of Bursa on October 14.","Swiss-mediated peace deal would normalize relations between Turkey, Armenia .

"(CNN) -- An emotional Novak Djokovic came back from a set down to beat Rafael Nadal 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the final of the Rome Masters. Nadal had won the first set 6-4 but Djokovic, who has dedicated his victories from previous rounds to the victims of floods that have deluged both Bosnia and his homeland Serbia, fought back to clinch a memorable victory. The Rome Masters has been something of a victory procession for Nadal, the defending champion who has won the title seven times. And it looked like he would make that eight after a steady first set put the Spaniard in control. Djokovic, however, was having none of it. After breaking Nadal's serve early in the second set Djokovic powered on to win the next two sets and his 19th career Masters title. ""He's one of the best in the world, he's playing great,"" Nadal said of Djokovic after the defeat. ""I played well for moments, I had my chances for moments, but I could have done with a little more energy at times. My legs didn't answer me after a tough week."" ""I was able to find positive things during the tournament but I played three very tough matches this week and it was very hard mentally, as well as physically. I was a little bit tired."" It is the first time in a decade that Nadal has lost three matches in a season on clay. Djokovic had endured something of a torrid time in Rome, struggling to defeat the young, big-hitting Canadian Milos Raonic in a three hour, three set epic in the semi-finals. Again Djokovic lost the first set, and again he powered back. After the match, Serbia's most famous sportsman described how he had been keeping abreast of events back home, sent a message of support and even criticized Western media outlets for not covering the floods adequately. ""There have not been floods like this in the existence of our people,"" he said after that match, as reported by The Guardian. ""It is a total catastrophe of biblical proportions. I don't really know how to describe it. Half the country is in danger of not having any electricity, there is total immobilization, evacuations -- and we're talking about whole cities, not small villages."" ""I see that on CNN, the BBC and other big networks there is a lot about the miners in Turkey, and so forth. This is another disaster, but there is no broadcast from Serbia and Bosnia, nothing about the biggest floods that we have ever seen, that maybe Europe has ever seen. This is incredible."" Now attention turns to the French Open, which begins next week. Nadal is the reigning champion and has won eight titles in the past nine years.","Novak Djokovic storms back from a set down to win Rome Masters .

"(CNN) -- The 15-year-old Mexican youth who was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mark Qualia told CNN Thursday. The victim, Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, had been apprehended by U.S. officials on more than one occassion but was never criminally charged, Qualia said. The use of juveniles to smuggle people across the border is a common tactic for smugglers, he said. Meanwhile, a video obtained by CNN casts doubt on the Border Patrol agent's claim that he was surrounded by rock-throwing suspected illegal immigrants when he fatally shot the boy on the border at Ciudad Juarez. CNN obtained the video, which was shot by a witness on a cell phone camera from the Mexican side of the border, from affiliate Univision. The video aired on its program Primer Impacto late Wednesday evening. The video shows part of the buildup before the incident, with several individuals running underneath the Puente Negro, a railroad span that connects the two countries. Monday night's incident started around 6:30 p.m. when Border Patrol agents responded to a report of a group of suspected illegal immigrants being smuggled into the United States near the Paso del Norte port of entry, FBI Special Agent Andrea Simmons said. In the distance, a U.S. Border Patrol officer on a bicycle can be seen making his way toward the area. Seconds later, the officer can be seen getting off the bicycle and approaching two of the four suspected Mexican nationals who had just crossed through an opening in the fence. One of the suspects is detained by the officer, but never handcuffed, and is dragged a short distance. This happened on the U.S. side of the border. Moments later, the officer points what appears to be his firearm in the direction of a second suspect, standing about 60 feet away from the officer -- on the Mexican side of the border. The video shows the suspect running away. Seconds later, two gunshots can be heard on the video. A third gunshot is heard in a different sequence of the tape. After the shooting, another suspect is seen running in the upper left side of screen away from the incident. ""They're throwing rocks,"" witnesses screaming in Spanish can be heard in the background of the video as the officer opens fire.  ""They hit him ... they hit him."" The video contradicts Simmons' account. She had said: ""This agent, who had the second subject detained on the ground, gave verbal commands to the remaining subjects to stop and retreat. However, the subjects surrounded the agent and continued to throw rocks at him. The agent then fired his service weapon several times, striking one subject who later died."" A federal law enforcement official told CNN that the FBI's use of the word ""surrounded,"" was ""probably not the best choice of words,"" and that it is more accurate to say that people were nearby throwing rocks. The FBI has been studying videos of the incident and said some of the video does show rocks being thrown at the Border Patrol agents, the official said. Hernandez Guereca was a secondary student in Juarez. ""The young man was not armed,"" said Sergio Belmonte, Ciudad Juarez spokesman. ""He did not have the physical size to threaten anyone. The aggression (by the U.S. agent) is evident.""  Belmonte said Hernandez was shot in the head. ""My people have spoken to his family. His dad says he was a straight-A student. His secondary school even sent him on an academic trip because of his good grades,"" Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said. A memorial for Hernandez was to be held in Juarez Thursday morning, according to Reyes. Local politicians were expected to attend. Reports that the Mexican military may have drawn weapons on U.S. Border Patrol agents, which surfaced earlier Wednesday, could not be immediately confirmed.  The tape released by Univision did not show any Mexican military troops. ""We are aware of those reports, but I cannot confirm them to you at this time,"" said Mexican military spokesman Enrique Torres.  ""I plan on speaking with the individuals who are said to have been involved, but I can't and won't confirm that to you. I cannot speculate."" The Mexican government has requested a quick and transparent investigation into the fatal shooting. Mexico ""reiterates that the use of firearms to repel a rock attack represents a disproportionate use of force, particularly coming from authorities who receive specialized training on the matter,"" the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday in a news release. Simmons told CNN earlier that she did not know whether the person who was shot was on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border, but the agent never left U.S. territory. The body was found on the Mexican side of the border, Simmons said. Peaceful protests against the U.S. Border Patrol were held in Juarez on Wednesday, near the site of the fatal shooting. In video shot by CNN affiliate KVIA, a man holding a bullhorn is seen pacing back and forth on the dusty streets of Juarez, pleading ""Justice for Hernandez"" to any passerby who would listen. The shooting comes less than two weeks after the May 31 death of a Mexican illegal immigrant who had been detained three days earlier by border agents in California. A suspect identified as Oscar Ivan Pineda Ayala was initially detained on the Rio Grande levee, said the FBI, which is leading the investigation. ""The growing frequency of this type of event reflects a worrisome increment in the use of excessive force on the part of some border authorities,"" the Mexican Foreign Ministry said. According to the ministry, the number of Mexicans who have been killed or wounded by U.S. border authorities has increased from five in 2008 to 12 in 2009 and 17 so far this year. Earlier, Qualia, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said he could not comment because he does not know where the Mexican government obtained its statistics. But Qualia said there were 799 assaults on border agents from October 1, 2009, through May 31 -- up from 745 assaults for the same time period in 2007-08 and 658 for the same span in 2008-09. Lethal force, he said, is allowed ""when an agent is in imminent threat of physical or bodily harm, which could cause death or injury or in protection of an innocent third party."" The determination of when to use lethal force, Qualia said, is made by each individual agent at the scene. From October 1 through May 31, he said, Custom and Border Protection agents used their firearms 31 times. Rock-throwing can be considered a dangerous assault, Qualia said: ""They're not chunking pebbles.""

"(CNN) -- Things are looking up for entrepreneurs in the Middle East as a new breed of crowdfunding is emerging to help bring life to innovative ideas from the region. Based on popular U.S. sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo they aim to connect everyone, from engineers in Egypt to creatives in Lebanon, with a new way of funding. Zoomaal is one such site that allows someone to post a ""project"" like an album, a book or an invention, which the public can then pledge money to. Each project must fit into one of the platform's categories and be accompanied by a video, a biography of the project owner and a series of ""gifts"" to incentivize potential backers to pledge money. In line with regional sensitivities, banned projects include anything to do with alcohol, politics, violence, religion and pornography. Abdallah Absi, 21, is the platform's founder who has been involved with tech start-ups since he was 16. ""There are many projects in the Arab world that don't have the right connections (to) fund them,"" said Absi. ""We are trying to market these projects through strategic partnerships."" Currently entrepreneurs from 22 countries across the Middle East and North Africa can post a project on the site. Projects include an album launch, a documentary and a new take on the toothbrush. Globally, crowdfunding is seeing explosive growth. In 2012, the market grew 81% to $2.7 billion, according industry researchers Massolution. But in the Middle East the concept is only just catching on. A lack of financial support and, crucially, mentorship is something that Absi believes is holding back creative projects and nascent start-ups in the region. For Habib Haddad, CEO of Wamda, and one of four venture capital funders behind Zoomaal, the true potential of Arab crowdfunding is the connections and exposure it provides. ""There is definitely a funding gap, but that's not the biggest gap. Access to early-stage money is actually now increasing in the Middle East. ""This kind of platform for the Middle East is something that will push the ecosystem of innovators forward,"" he added. ""It will help democratise creativity."" Absi believes the key to making this happen is education and outreach because some ""creative communities are not very tech savvy ... and they don't know about the opportunity they can have from crowdfunding."" Another crowdfunding platform to emerge in the region is Cairo-based Yomken. A non-profit social enterprise, it aims to link up low-tech manufacturers -- who, in Egypt, are often slum-dwellers -- with artists, scientists, engineers and product designers who can help them innovate in their businesses. Once a prototype of a new product has been made, it can be posted on the site, allowing customers to pre-order. Adel El-Dib, 49, is a potter Yomken has helped. Seven years ago, El-Dib who crafts everything from pots and bowls to decorative earthenware, moved to using cheaper fiberglass instead of clay to make food and water coolers. Studies have shown that inhaling fiberglass can cause lung problems, according to the American Lung Association. Yomken connected El-Dib with an artist and a physicist to design an eco-friendly clay cooler for food and drinks. The new design, based on an ancient water cooler known as a ""qolah"" made with an innovative clay mix, can cool water in 12 hours in summer and two in winter. El-Dib has sold his new product on Yomken. ""I always worked on clay since (I was) 12 years old, but lately given the drop in demand, I shifted to fiberglass. ""The designers brought by Yomken have shown me new designs and I was convinced to try (them). Hopefully, they will bring back the clay industry to the market,"" he said. The platform was set up in 2012 by Egyptian Tamer Taha, 24, with funding from the World Bank. According to Taha, basic manufacturing makes up almost 90% of the Egyptian market, and is increasingly under pressure from other manufacturing bases, especially in Asia. ""We try to work on this link from the open innovation part of the website (to the crowdfunding part) ... to try to market innovative products that are coming from Egyptian minds,"" he said. Yomken is a politically neutral organization, says Taha, but the security situation after the recent military coup that removed Mohamed Morsy as Egypt's president did paralyze work. ""We hope the month of Ramadan (the annual month of fasting and prayer for Muslims) will bring all the disputing parties together from their narrow political interests and focus on the nationwide interest of the people and the economy,"" he said. ""This is what really matters. We believe that now ... it's time for the Arab nations to rise again through science and innovation.""","New online platforms offer chance for ideas to be funded by the public .

"(CNN) -- Actress Katherine Heigl wants a drugstore chain to pay her $6 million because it tweeted a photo of her shopping there. Heigl filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday accusing Duane Reade of misappropriating her image, published on a celebrity news website to promote its stores. If she wins, the judgment proceeds would go to a charity Heigl created in the memory of her brother who died in a car crash as a teen, the lawsuit said. The legal controversy started when the Duane Reade Twitter account posted a link to a JustJared.com story about Heigl signing with a new management agency on March 18. The story featured a photo showing Heigl, who starred on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" carrying two plastic Duane Reade bags as she appeared to be leaving one of its stores. The tweet read, ""Love a quick #DuaneReade run? Even @KatieHeigl can't resist shopping #NYC's favorite drugstore"" Duane Reade's Facebook page also carried the photo with the caption, ""Don't you just love a quick #DuaneReade run? Even Katherine Heigl can't resist shopping at #NYC's most convenient drugstore!"" ""Use of Plaintiffs image under these circumstances improperly exploited Plaintiffs name and likeness, as a celebrity, for Defendant's commercial advertising and purposes of trade, without authorization,"" the suit contends. ""Such use was done knowingly and willfully, as evidenced by Defendant's manipulation of and changes to the Duane Reade advertising messages in the captions, after Defendant had intentionally stripped out all evidence of the original news context to the Heigl Photograph."" A spokesman for Duane Reade said the company has a policy of not commenting on pending litigation. Its lawyers have not filed a response in court.

"(CNN) -- Valentine's Day is here. If you're single, you will likely find yourself assessing and reassessing your love life. Your Instagram feed full of perfectly filtered photos of roses, chocolates and TMI kisses will be a constant reminder that you are not in love and not in a relationship. Meanwhile, an endless string of engagement announcements on Facebook might lead you to question your singlehood and wonder what you have been doing wrong. You might even find yourself vowing to find a significant other by next year's Valentine's so that you can be the one tweeting about finding that perfect gift. But how? Should you follow the old-fashioned pathway to love? Put on a little black dress, hit the town and hope that someone invites you to dinner and a movie? Recreate your parents' courtship? No. Because it's 2013, and traditional dating as we know it is dead. When I traveled across the United States a few years ago, I interviewed more than 100 men, women and couples about their love lives in cities big and small. My mission was to figure out what connection, romance and love actually looks like in today's day and age. What I found was that we're living in a post-dating world. The lost art of offline dating . The happy couples I talked to had not met and immediately started dating. Instead, they connected in more natural -- and yes, ambiguous -- settings. They played on the same volleyball team or were co-workers on a political campaign. Or they hung out in the same social group or were friends for years before getting intimately involved or got intimately involved right off the bat with no initial relationship plans. Or they met each other while living in different parts of the country and got to know each other via Facebook or Gchat before committing to full-on romances. Instead of going on explicit dates, they had tested the romantic waters, moved in and out of gray areas, and used technology to explore the various aspects of their connection before putting labels or expectations on their relationship. This romantic ambiguity was also reflected in my conversations with people who were single. Asked to define their romantic status, they gave me answers like, ""Well, it's sort of up in the air ..."" and ""It's really complicated! How much time do you have?"" and ""I would define it as, hmm, dating? Ish? Dating-ish?"" Online dating and a formula for love . Single people weren't dating, and young couples who had fallen in love hadn't gotten to that point through dating. Yes, there were men and women who bemoaned the death of dating. They yearned for the straightforward clarity of an earlier era where gender roles were obvious and technology didn't play such a central role. Then they wouldn't have to deal with the ambiguity of e-mails or the unclear signals of text messages. They wouldn't have to overanalyze every word and interaction. At the same time, though, even those people were ready to admit that going on actual ""dates"" was full of pressure and not very enjoyable. Traditional dating, they pointed out, encouraged an overly formal, inauthentic vibe that ultimately hindered instead of helped their efforts to make romantic connections. This was perfectly expressed to me by a 29-year-old female personal trainer in Denver who had experimented with online dating, matchmakers and blind dates. ""It's hard to tell anything on the first date -- you're so on the surface,"" she explained. ""I think expectations make things more difficult. They make it so much harder to pick someone, because you feel like the stakes are higher. ... You miss that spark. ... Whereas when you're just 'hanging out,' it's easier."" Cougars in training: Young women dating even younger men . If women struggled with the pressures of traditional dating, men hated them.

"(CNN) -- Josh Hardy, the 7-year-old boy whose parents fought to get him an experimental antiviral drug, is recovering well -- sitting up on his own and even taking a few steps with the help of a walker and his parents' supportive arms. ""He's getting stronger every day,"" says his mother, Aimee Hardy. ""We're completely optimistic and hopeful that he'll make a full recovery with no disabilities."" Josh was in critical condition and near death in March when the drug company Chimerix denied him the use of its drug brincidofovir. A few days later, following reports by CNN and intense pressure from social media, Chimerix reversed course and allowed Josh and other patients like him to become part of its clinical trials. Josh was released from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, last month but continues to receive care there. Drug brings remarkable improvement for boy . He, his parents and three brothers, who live in Virginia, are now staying at an apartment near the hospital. His mother says he won't be healthy enough to return home until next month at the earliest. Before receiving brincidofovir, an adenovirus was ravaging Josh's immune system, left vulnerable by treatment for cancer, and the only available antiviral drug to treat it wasn't working. Once he started taking brincidofovir, the adenovirus was gone from Josh's blood in two weeks. ""It's truly a miracle drug,"" his mother says. While the adenovirus has disappeared, Josh is still suffering the effects of the medication his doctors gave him as a second-choice drug when he wasn't allowed to take brincidofovir. He now receives blood transfusions once a week and dialysis three times a week. He has to be fed intravenously. But there are signs his kidneys are beginning to work. ""On Easter Sunday he peed 110 milliliters at one time and I said, 'Oh, thank you!' "" his mother says. Dying patients denied drugs . Traditionally, drug companies have not been allowed to treat so-called ""compassionate use"" patients such as Josh as study subjects, so helping them out has been pure charity work on behalf of the drug company. But the Food and Drug Aministration allowed Chimerix to use data from Josh and others as part of its application to the agency, helping to get the drug on the market faster. The Hardys said they were saddened to hear that Kenneth Moch, who as president of Chimerix initially denied them the drug but eventually helped Josh get it, is no longer with the company. According to Chimerix, Moch resigned ""to pursue other interests."" ""I feel terrible. I feel like it was our fault,"" Aimee Hardy says. ""He's a genuine guy who was just put in a bad situation."" Moch says he's looking for a new job. ""The Hardy family should feel no responsibility for this whatsoever, and I appreciate their kind thoughts,"" Moch says.

"(CNN) -- A month and a half ago -- 46 days -- Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished over the southern Indian Ocean. The milestone is a somber one because it now allows attorneys to move in. There's a 45-day federal law that says American lawyers have to wait that long to reach out to a family that's lost a loved one in a plane crash. What it means is that families can now file suit in American courts against U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. The only problem: No wreckage has been found. It's kind of like a murder case without a body. Some relatives of those on board the missing plane said they hope legal avenues can bring new information to light. ""We don't feel we have a whole lot of other choices because we're certainly not getting any answers without (legal action),"" Sarah Bajc, partner of Flight 370 passenger Philip Wood, told CNN on Tuesday. The frustration among the families is that Malaysian officials give opinions, but no data, at their briefings. Legal pressure on the Malaysian government, Bajc said, might force it to release data it holds. Attorneys have approached families about compensation lawsuits, but Bajc said the feeling among the relatives is that they do not want to file lawsuits of that type to chase money. Searching but 'no contacts of interest' Search efforts for MH370 have repeatedly come up empty. The underwater drone scanning the ocean floor started its 10th mission on Tuesday, but there have been ""no contacts of interest"" in the first nine, Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. The Bluefin-21 has scanned about 80% of the intended territory without finding any sign of MH370. Search leaders said the probe was still at work Wednesday morning. ""If we don't have the 'black box' with all the critical information on it, or we don't have any part of the wreckage, it would be very hard to maintain a claim against Boeing in any court in the United States,"" said aviation attorney Daniel Rose, a partner at the firm Kreindler & Kreindler. Some argue the U.S. federal law barring attorneys' contact with victims' families for 45 days after an air disaster does not apply to crashes outside the United States. In fact, at least one law firm has already taken the initial steps for a lawsuit. Aviation attorney Monica Kelly said she filed a request for documents and other information in an Illinois court last month in a case against Malaysia Airlines and Boeing. She said she represents Januari Siregar, whose son was aboard Flight 370. While it may be more difficult to make a case against Boeing, the same can't be said for Malaysia Airlines. The Montreal Convention governs such matters. Under international law, families can sue in the country where the passengers bought the ticket, where the airline is based or their final destination. But the lawsuits and the money they may bring will never replace what families have lost or answer all their questions. Sad, angry MH370 relatives in agonizing limbo . Waiting for answers . Malaysia Airlines representatives and government officials had scheduled a meeting Tuesday with families of Chinese passengers in Beijing, but the session was postponed. Relatives were told some Chinese tech experts would probably talk to them instead. It was the second day in a row they had been disappointed, which only added to their frustration. On Monday, the relatives wept, begged and cursed a Malaysian diplomat in China's capital. They went to a meeting at a hotel there, expecting a long-awaited briefing from Malaysian technical experts, but erupted in anger when the diplomat announced there wouldn't be one. ""We don't know at this point whether they are alive or dead. And you haven't given us any direct proof of where they actually are. We want our loved ones back,"" a father of a missing passenger cried. Drawing up a list . Relatives have drawn up 26 questions, many of them on technical issues, that they want Malaysian officials to address. Among them: What's in the flight's log book? Can they review the jet's maintenance records? Can they listen to recordings of the Boeing 777 pilot's conversations with air traffic controllers just before contact was lost? The diplomat said it's hard to give families answers when they have so little information about the March 8 flight that set off from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur destined for Beijing. Because of the plane's flight path, most of the lawsuits against Malaysia Airlines would be filed in China or Malaysia. The families of the three Americans who were on board the Boeing 777 can also sue Malaysia Airlines in U.S. courts. Kelly, an attorney at Ribbeck Law Chartered, a firm that specializes in aviation accident cases, said she believes based on her experience that families could receive between $400,000 and $3 million in damages. However, it could take two years before they see the money, she said. Oceanic salvage manager: How we search for Flight 370 .

"(CNN) -- Beijing police have significantly stepped up security measures in China's capital, in what the country's state media described as ""an escalation of anti-terror efforts"" following a string of attacks. Beijing has deployed more than 1,300 armed police officers and 150 patrol vehicles throughout the city at major intersections, according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. Each armed vehicle, comprised of nine police members and four assistants, are expected to cover a three-kilometer (1.86 mile) radius and respond to any incident within three minutes. The presence of these armed vehicles were called a ""deterrent to terrorists,"" according to Xinhua. Such visible measures come as China reels from several bloody bomb and knife attacks in rail stations over the past few months. Reaction to attacks . Separate incidents, in Kunming in March, where 29 were killed and 130 injured in knife attacks, as well as in Urumqi -- where three were killed and 79 hurt -- at the end of April and in the southern city of Guangzhou a few days later, with a further six injured, have highlighted the seriousness of the situation. Last year in October Tiananmen Square, Beijing's iconic tourist destination, was the site of another alleged terrorist attack, when two Uyghurs crashed a jeep in the Square. Five were killed and dozens injured in the incident. China's Minister of Public Security, Guo Shengkun, recently advocated hardline tactics against potential terror attacks. ""We should keep the pressure on and dare to strike heavy blows... and firmly foil such plans before they become realities,"" the minister was quoted in the state-run People's Daily newspaper. Separatists from the Uyghur minority group have been blamed for the attacks, which are classed as acts of terrorism by authorities. Many Uyghurs, most of whom live in the far-western province of Xinjiang, decry Beijing's influence and the creep of ethnic Han culture into their lives. Separatists want the creation of an independent state called East Turkestan. The central government say that they have done much to improve the lives of those in the remote region. Q&A: China's restive far west . Tiananmen connection? The international media has been reporting on the high-profile crackdown in Beijing as the 25th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square approaches. The connection was not highlighted by Chinese media, as mentions of the incident have been scrubbed. Several activists, including the prominent humans-rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, have been detained ahead of the anniversary, which takes place on June 4. China's porous borders . Meanwhile, China's minister of national defense has highlighted the country's borders with Myanmar, Laos and Thailand as a weak point in the fight against violent Uyghur separatism. ""(We must) strictly control the border and, according to law, crack down on violent terrorism, drug manufacturing and trafficking and other criminal activities,"" Chang Wanquan said on the ministry's website. The state-run newspaper Global Times reported that last month, security checks were lacking at key transport hubs and that passengers had been carrying ""caged livestock, hammers and knives"" when they boarded Shanghai's subway.","150 police vehicles, 1,350 armed officers to be deployed on capital's streets .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto called for a ""new debate"" on the drug war and said the United States must play an important role in that discussion. The presumptive president-elect spoke this week to Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" His comments will air Sunday. ""Yes, I do believe we should open up a new debate regarding how to wage war on drug trafficking. Personally, I'm not in favor of legalizing drugs. I'm not persuaded by that as an argument. However, let's open up a new debate, a review, in which the U.S. plays a fundamental role in conducting this review,"" said Peña Nieto. More than 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence since Felipe Calderon, Mexico's current president, made combating cartels a top priority when he took office in 2006. Peña Nieto has pledged to focus more on reducing violence and less on catching cartel leaders and blocking drugs from reaching the United States. ""What we seek now in our new strategy is to adjust what's been done up until now. It's not a radical change. It's to broaden the coverage and above all, the emphasis I aspire to of reducing the violence in our country,"" he told Zakaria. ""I'm persuaded that if we achieve the specialization in the work carried out by the various branches of the federal police and the inspector general's office, waging war on impunity will allow us to combat crime,"" he said. The presumptive president-elect also weighed in on Arizona's immigration law, which allows police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws if ""reasonable suspicion"" exists that the person is in the United States illegally. The controversial provision was recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. It struck down other parts of the law. ""Clearly, it seems to me that these are discriminatory laws that don't recognize the contribution and the value of millions of immigrants, particularly from my country, who make enormous contributions to the United States' economic development. It's clear to me that Mexico must facilitate conditions for greater economic development through structural reforms, energy reforms, treasury reform, labor reform, in order to generate jobs and greater opportunities in my country, so that immigration is a decision and not a necessity for Mexicans,"" he said. An official tally of returns Friday confirmed Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, as the winner of Mexico's presidential election. Final tally confirms PRI victory in Mexico . But until the country's electoral tribunal ratifies the results -- and challenges are virtually assured -- he remains the presumptive president-elect. Peña Nieto's closest rival, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to challenge the results, accusing the PRI of vote-buying, and said that he would take his complaints through the legal system. The federal electoral tribunal, known as TRIFE, will begin to accept complaints Monday of voting irregularities. The tribunal will have until September 6 to complete its investigation and ratify -- or reverse -- the official election results. The new president will be sworn in December 1.","The presumptive president-elect speaks to CNN's Fareed Zakaria .

"(CNN) -- Media magnate Rupert Murdoch will meet journalists at his News International subsidiary in London Friday, to take charge of the crisis surrounding the embattled Sun newspaper, with some speculating whether he will ""sacrifice"" UK staff to prevent the controversy from spilling across the Atlantic. ""At the moment it appears he is ready to sacrifice the journalists and journalism in London to do whatever it takes to be seen to be cleaning up his act there so that it will play better in the United States,"" Andrew Neil, a former editor of Murdoch paper The Sunday Times, told CNN. ""The consequence of that is quite amazing -- The Sun, which is the most loyal newspaper Murdoch has ever owned -- now believes it is being hung out to dry and the Sun journalists are turning against them."" Murdoch issued a personal assurance to one of his executives that he'll continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper, according to an internal staff memo sent by News International Chief Executive Tom Mockridge. Allegations of pay-offs to public officials by Sun employees -- five of whom were arrested Saturday -- threatens to bring the UK crisis across the shores to the U.S., where the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prevents companies from paying bribes overseas. ""This is for Rupert Murdoch no longer about journalism. This is about defending News Corp., his American based parent company, from judicial action and investigation in the United States,"" Neil said. Such actions could put broadcast operations, the most profitable part of the News Corp. operations, in jeopardy, said Porter Bibb of Mediatech Capital Partners in New York. ""If it can be proven that anybody working for News Corp. bribed or gave money to an official of a foreign government -- i.e. the UK -- that's a clear violation and the Justice Department will start the wheels in motion, and I think that's what Rupert Murdoch has been gearing up for in the past few months,"" Bibb said. All of the Sun employees were released on bail, and none so far have been charged. A wave of scandals . This latest controversy surrounding Murdoch newspapers in the UK also raises a larger issue of journalists protecting confidential sources and paying to get information. If the case moves to the U.S., it raises the specter of anti-bribery laws in a showdown with the First Amendment, which protects freedom of the press. ""It's really ironic that the greatest threat to freedom of the press in Great Britain today, and around the world today perhaps, has come from Rupert Murdoch because of his excesses,"" said Carl Bernstein, the Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist who, along with Bob Woodward, broke the Watergate series of stories that eventually led to the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. The arrests of the Sun employees comes after Murdoch-owned newspaper News of the World was found to have hacked into private voice mails of a widespread range of public officials, celebrities and victims of crime. The phone-hacking scandal prompted Murdoch's son, News Corp. executive James Murdoch, to shut down News of the World in July. The best-selling British newspaper was 168 years old. So far, News Corp. and its subsidiary companies have paid more than $200 million in legal fees and settling of 59 of 60 lawsuits that have been filed in the phone hacking case. Phone hacking: How the scandal unfolded . James Murdoch is now facing new e-mail evidence that would have made him aware of widespread phone-hacking at the newspaper. The younger Murdoch has appeared twice before a UK investigatory committee and said he has no knowledge of the practice. While Murdoch started in newspapers, the UK division of his News Corp. empire -- which includes movie studio 20th Century Fox, the Fox Broadcasting Company and Harper Collins Publishers -- is only a $1.6 billion slice of the $32 billion empire. Dark side of the Sun . ""I can't imagine a corporate crisis that is larger than this,"" said Michael Wolff, a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and author of ""The Man Who Owns the News: Inside the Secret World of Rupert Murdoch."" ""There are essentially two parts of the company: There's the American company which comprises most of the assets and earnings, and then there is the British company that is composed mostly of newspapers,"" Wolff told CNN. ""That's kind of a legacy company. It's one of the places where Murdoch got his start and one of the places where his heart is. ""Most of the News Corp. executives in America have been saying for a long time, `why do we have newspapers?'"" Wolff said. ""The legal jeopardy of his son and heir, James Murdoch, gets more and more dire every day. I think they need to do something big and final, and I think it's going to be getting rid of his UK business."" The Sun's editor, Dominic Mohan, has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million. Paying for stories . The arrests of journalists have spread alarm, and prompted an editorial by the Sun that police dawn raids against its journalists were part of a ""witch-hunt"" that had left Britain behind former Soviet states on press freedom. But there is a sense that the practices that helped Murdoch build his media empire are now threatening to bring it down. ""This is a system that Rupert Murdoch set up, these are his values that the Sun has practiced, let's not kid ourselves about it any more than the atmosphere in the Nixon White House was about his aids and underlings,"" Bernstein said. ""It's both a tragic story and story of real corruption -- institutional corruption, moral corruption of a journalistic institution, but at the same time we need to protect the principal of protecting sources."" ""Rupert Murdoch had tabloid view of journalism, probably still does, that you do whatever it takes to get the story. The end will justify the means. You've got to destroy the competition,"" said Neil, who worked with Murdoch for 11 years. Bernstein said there are circumstances where paying for information is permissible. ""Such as if you are in Bosnia and you say to somebody, 'take me to a mass graves, I want to see the mass graves site'. (But) is it permissible while following the royals around to say, 'here's 100 pounds, tell me what the royal family was doing last night'? No. But at the same time, these bums ought to be protected along with those who practice real journalism.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, might not be the Republican Party's key to electoral victory as once thought. Patterns are emerging that Republicans and like-minded groups are broadening their scope and not homing in on a singular anti-Obamacare message. In March, Reince Priebus, head of the Republican National Committee, told CNN's Candy Crowley that Obamacare is ""complete poison"" and advised Republican candidates they ""have to hit your main target which is Obamacare"" in order to win. But in the political world, things change fast, and March is the equivalent to a millennium ago. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is in a reelection bid against surprisingly strong Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, recently said that while he wants to repeal the law, Kentucky's version, Kynect, is ""unconnected"" to the fate of Obamacare. Kynect is relatively popular in Kentucky, providing insurance coverage to more than 413,000 people, but was created under the Affordable Care Act and is funded mostly through federal funds. McConnell's shift is subtle but meaningful. During his primary campaign against a candidate who billed himself as more conservative than McConnell, the Senate leader took a hard-line stance on getting rid of -- or repealing -- Obamacare, which has been the Republican mantra until recently. He's not the only one. Americans for Prosperity, which is expected to spend north of $100 million this election cycle backing issues that Republicans favor, has also shifted its strategy. In the lead up to the launch of Obamacare last fall, during its disastrous rollout and in the months after, AFP had a laser-like focus on the issue, spending tens of millions of dollars in states and districts where Democrats are vulnerable. 2014 primaries: What's at stake . ""We do want to make sure that Obamacare is the Number One issue in the country,"" AFP President Tim Phillips said in February. At that time, the law had been in effect for less than two months, it was lagging behind its target enrollment pace and the effects of a bad roll out still permeated. Phillips said Obamacare is going to be the top issue because the ""tidal wave affects are going to continue with Obamacare."" Furthermore, a March 15 statement on the organization's website described itself as the ""nation's foremost advocate for health care freedom."" But now, two months later, AFP has broadened its scope. Its website now features a campaign against the Export-Import Bank, which is not related to Obamacare. Also, an ad airing in Louisiana, where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is locked in a tight reelection race, attacks her for ""wasteful government spending."" Missing from the ad -- the word ""Obamacare."" In addition, its partner group, AFP Foundation, launched an $850,000 ad buy in Wisconsin earlier this week that focuses on taxes and also doesn't mention the O-word. AFP doesn't deny it. ""We're responding to the changing environment,"" AFP spokesman Levi Russell said. ""That initial shock (of Obamacare) has changed a little bit, but it hasn't gone away."" Republicans are now retooling their message, after having emerged from primary battles of who's farther to the right they must now try to appeal to a more diverse audience that has become more accepting of the federal health care program approved in 2010 without Republican support. Polling suggests that public attitudes are shifting. The latest CNN poll from early May found that 38% of people wanted to either replace the law or get rid of it. The results are similar to a CBS poll which found 35% of respondents said the law needs to be repealed, which is a far better billing than the 43% who felt the same way in November. Elizabeth Wilner with the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan polling group, wrote that Republicans are starting to use the word ""fix"" in their campaigning, instead of ""repeal."" ""Republicans have been gearing up for months ... to run against Obamacare, then it started to work,"" Michael Czin, spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said, noting that 8 million people have signed up. Since Republicans gained control of the House in 2011, they voted more than 50 times on a full or partial repeal of the health care law, that's more than one vote per month, but the pace has fallen off dramatically in recent months. 2014 key races to watch . That matters because in an election year, congressional business is connected to electoral politics as lawmakers want to either promote their agenda or tarnish the other party. But Russell predicts the issue will not go away, especially as the elections approach and new premium rates are announced this fall. ""Our role is going to be to remind folks how we got here in the first place,"" he said.","Republicans are broadening their message beyond Obamacare .
Polling suggests that fewer people want to repeal the law .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Rescue teams searched Tuesday for seven people thought to have survived after three military helicopters came down on the side of Kenya's highest mountain, in a remote area that is home to leopards and rhinoceros. Two of the helicopters crashed and the third crash-landed on Mount Kenya Sunday as they were on their way to join a peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Lt. Gen. Edward Katumba Wamala, Uganda's commander of army land forces, said Tuesday that 21 people had been accounted for and the search continues for seven more. Ugandan military helicopters go missing . One of the aircraft could be seen burned out on the side of Mount Kenya, said Gen. J.J. Odongo, Uganda's defense minister. However, the military can neither confirm nor deny any deaths at the moment, he said. The passengers in the helicopter which crash-landed were found and rescued Monday after the pilot issued a distress call. Kenyan military officer Brig. Francis Ogola said the sites where the other two helicopters crashed have now been found and that military and police aircraft are carrying out a search for the presumed survivors. ""The fate of the occupants remains unknown,"" Ogola said. However, the team at one of the sites found ""no dead bodies,"" but rather ""items ... arranged in a matter that suggest that they have evacuated from that location and they are somewhere in the mountain."" This is cause for ""good hope"" that the soldiers and airmen will be found, Ogola said. Conditions on the mountainside may be tough, however. The survivors will have to contend with rugged terrain and altitude. Mount Kenya is the second-highest peak on the African continent, after Kilimanjaro, at just over 17,000 feet, according to UNESCO. According to the Mount Kenya park service and UNESCO, elephants, rhinos, giant forest hogs and leopards are among the creatures that live in the area. The mountain sides are riven by steep valleys and the vegetation is alpine higher up, changing to bamboo further down the slopes, UNESCO says. Odongo said the crashes were an ""accident"" and that the helicopters were in ""good condition."" Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has appointed a panel to investigate the cause of the accidents, which will be headed by the president's younger brother, Gen. Caleb Akandwanaho, Odongo said. However, Odongo said the cause was turbulence due to ""bad weather."" Only one helicopter in the group of four made it to their next scheduled stop in Garissa, Kenya, where they were due to refuel. The helicopters were part of the first deployment of air support for the African Union Mission in Somalia in Mogadishu, where Ugandan, Burundian and other African Union forces are fighting Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group. Odongo said the Ugandan government and army would reassess their capacity to continue with the deployment of military air power to AMISOM following the crashes. It had taken Uganda more than three months to prepare for the deployment, he added, with all crew undergoing U.N. training. The aircraft left Nanyuki, in Kenya's Rift Valley, after originally being dispatched last week from Entebbe, Uganda. Ugandan army spokesman Col. Felix Kulayigye said that one helicopter pilot then made a distress call saying he had made an emergency landing in the mountains. The pilot and crew of that helicopter were rescued and have been taken safely to Nanyuki Air Force Base, he said. Al-Shabaab, which has battled Somalia's weak transitional government since 2007, controls much of southern Somalia and is active around the capital city of Mogadishu. The United States listed it as a terror organization in 2008. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for suicide bombings that killed more than 70 people in Uganda in 2010 and has threatened attacks against U.S., Kenyan and Burundian interests in the region.

"(CNN) -- As heavy rains raked the Mid-South on Thursday, authorities in Tennessee searched for a 6-year-old boy swept away by floodwaters. Jeremy Heidt of Tennessee Emergency Management said a family of four was stuck in high water in Hickman County. When they got out of their vehicle, the rushing water swept the boy away, he said. Three people died in Tennessee and Arkansas on Thursday in weather-related incidents. In Lawrence County, a 72-year-old man died when he tried to drive across a flooded road and his car was swept downstream and submerged, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said. In Jonesboro, Arkansas, a 74-year-old retired police officer was killed when a tree fell on his house, reported CNN affiliate WMC. In Black Rock, Arkansas, a tree fell on a van and killed a woman inside, said Brandon Morris of the state emergency management agency. Memphis took a hit Thursday from storms that had rolled eastward from the Great Plains. The Memphis Light, Gas and Water's website said about 42,000 customer lost power at one point due to bad weather. Delta Medical Center was without power and had a gas explosion that caused a two-alarm fire. CNN affiliate WCM, quoting a hospital spokesman, said nobody was injured. The weather caused play to be suspended for several hours at the FedEx St. Jude Classic golf tournament on Thursday, according to the PGA website. Heidt said other Tennessee counties reported weather problems. In Carroll County, some hallways were flooded at Baptist Hospital. Madison County had power outages at the Regional Health Department and its emergency operations center. Lightning knocked out power at the Henderson County 911 Center, forcing authorities to use a backup system. More bad weather is expected Friday in Memphis, with the National Weather Service predicting a 70% chance of precipitation and up to 2 inches of rain. There's a 60% chance in Birmingham, Alabama. CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh said severe weather could last until Saturday in the South and Great Plains, with heavy rain, hail, damaging wind and flash flooding possible. Isolated tornadoes are possible, too. In parts of Nebraska, people were cleaning up from the hailstorms that struck on Tuesday. As expected, bargain hunters flocked to Woodhouse Family Auto in Blair to buy some of the 4,300 cars damaged by hail, reported CNN affiliate KPTM. The hail smashed car windshields and dented the bodies. Dealership officials estimated the damage at $162 million. Car prices were determined on a case-by-case basis, with one buyer saying he picked up a Chrysler 300 with broken windows, a broken door handle and lots of dings for $31,000, reported KPTM. The car normally sells for about $54,000, the buyer said.","NEW: Child swept away by floodwaters in Hickman County, Tennessee .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama's campaign is making better use of the Internet and social media to reach voters than presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney, according to a study released Wednesday. The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that Obama's campaign was more active than Romney's and generated more response from users on all major platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and the campaign websites, in the weeks following Romney's clinching of the Republican nomination. For instance, during the June 4-17 study period, Obama's campaign posted an average of 29 messages per day compared to Romney's average of one, according to Pew. The Obama campaign website and blog were updated an average of eight times a day, twice as often as Romney's, Pew found. Obama's social media messages also reached a much wider audience, according to Pew. On Facebook, users expressed support for nearly twice as many Obama posts as they did Romney posts. Twitter users passed along, or retweeted, 150,106 Obama messages to their own followers, compared to 8,601 retweets of Romney posts, according to the study. Pew said Obama had more than 18 million followers on Twitter when it last audited the account, in August, compared to 787,080 for Romney. Obama's Facebook page had 27.5 million supporters, compared to 2.9 million for Romney. The results echo the 2008 campaign, when Obama's campaign had more than five times the supporters on Facebook as then Republican rival John McCain two months before the election, according to Pew. At the time, analysts credited Obama's technologically savvy campaign with helping reach and organize voters, especially among younger supporters. ""While more digital activity does not necessarily translate into more votes, historically candidates who are first to exploit changing technology have an advantage,"" project director Tom Rosenstiel said in a statement. ""From Roosevelt to Reagan, presidential candidates have used the way they communicate to suggest that they understand how the country is changing."" The study follows news from June showing that Obama was also leading Romney in the use of online advertising. Obama spent $16.4 million in online advertising in the first few months of 2012, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Romney had spent $7.8 million, according to the filings. The Pew study released Wednesday focused on the campaigns' use of social media in early June, shortly after Romney had won enough delegates in state primaries to clinch the GOP presidential nomination. According to the Pew study: . Romney's campaign has closed the gap in some respects since the June study period, the center's Deputy Director Amy Mitchell said in a statement. ""But there is a long way to go before the Romney team matches the level of activity of the Obama campaign,"" Mitchell said.","Barack Obama's campaign continues its online dominance, a new study finds .

"(CNN) -- The best chocolate cake I ever ate in Kabul was tucked away on a discreet corner near the city's diplomatic area. Kamal Hamade, the well-known and loved Lebanese owner of Taverna du Liban, made sure every visitor to his restaurant had a piece of gooey cake on the house, and then some. On Saturday, the Taliban attacked the cozy Lebanese restaurant in Afghanistan's capital. One man detonated a suicide vest while two others stormed into the restaurant and fired at those inside, killing 21 people, 13 of them expatriates. One of them was Kamal. Taverna had a decent security routine in place: Visitors drove up and knocked. The Afghan guard slid open the peep hole to take a look. The patron was searched before being let in to the restaurant a short distance away from the metal-door entrance. But unlike many other establishments visited by Kabul's foreign residents, Taverna had one less door, one less pat down and lacked a long corridor away from the street. The restaurant and its owner were what security experts call soft targets -- semi-armored and lightly guarded. I walked through that aluminum metal door many times during my two years living in Kabul and working for an Afghan media company. One of those times, I was on my first date with the man who's now my husband. Another night, after a leisurely dinner with friends -- most of it on the house under Kamal's watch -- I was left alone to wait. My ride was nowhere to be seen, and Taverna had closed. Not wanting to bother the servers, who were ready to leave, and Kamal, who looked tired, I slipped outside to the front of Taverna to wait. Kamal tried to lure me back inside, but I also enjoyed the rare few moments outside in Kabul. When I told Kamal I would be fine, he brought out a plastic chair and sat with me. Kamal was originally from Lebanon, but it was clear from all our conversations that he loved Afghanistan. That night, we laughed, talked about Beirut, and watched his cat slink up and down the muddy street. Forty-five minutes later, my ride showed up. I went back to Taverna dozens of times after that visit, always catching a smile and laugh from Kamal -- with a hunk of chocolate cake. It seems like almost everyone who has lived in Kabul has a Kamal story. After the attack, friends, family and frequent patrons of the restaurant immediately took to social media to express their concern. ""Any word on Kamal, the owner of Taverna, or his staff?"" development worker Una Moore wrote in a Twitter post. Once security officials confirmed his death, photos popped on Facebook as people who knew Kamal and his restaurant shared their memories. Albums with titles like ""Taverna"" were filled with pictures of groups of smiling people gathered around long, wooden tables. Kamal, like most nights that he was in the country, was in the building the night of the attack, wandering around the restaurant with a cigarette or in his office, most likely. He lived above the Lebanese restaurant, keeping a loving eye on the falafel, staff and visitors. For many of us, it's hard to believe someone who loved Kabul so much -- and who was so much a part of the Kabul we loved -- has become a casualty in a deadly attack. Kamal's restaurant allowed for quiet dinners or raucous get-togethers after long work days. Kabul, known to the foreign diplomat, aid worker and journalist inhabitants as the ""Kabubble,"" was a relatively safe place compared to the rest of the country. Much of my two years there were spent haphazardly throwing on a headscarf, walking down to the nearest supermarket to buy potato chips or use decent wi-fi at a cafe. The city never felt unsafe. Only one similar event comes to mind in recent years. In January 2011, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a supermarket popular with expatriates and middle-class Afghans alike. Those of us in the Kabubble were thrown off for a few days, left jarred, vowing it was time to get out. After a few weeks riddled with lockdowns, the event faded into the city's memory -- a moment of violence that had passed. This attack seems different, though. Perhaps not for the Afghan civilians who have lived through similar attacks for the last decade. But for the people who live in and love Afghanistan out of choice, it does change something. I don't know what this means for the country's upcoming election, for Afghans after the NATO troop withdrawals scheduled for later this year, or for the foreigners who flock to the country, investing themselves in the nation and its people. But I do know that without Kamal in Kabul, the city is a darker place.","Restaurant owner Kamal Hamade was among 21 people killed in a Taliban attack .

"(CNN) -- Americans may need passports to board domestic flights or to picnic in a national park next year if they live in one of the states defying the federal Real ID Act. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff says there are no plans for a federal database of drivers' information. The act, signed in 2005 as part of an emergency military spending and tsunami relief bill, aims to weave driver's licenses and state ID cards into a sort of national identification system by May 2008. The law sets baseline criteria for how driver's licenses will be issued and what information they must contain. The Department of Homeland Security insists Real ID is an essential weapon in the war on terror, but privacy and civil liberties watchdogs are calling the initiative an overly intrusive measure that smacks of Big Brother. More than half the nation's state legislatures have passed or proposed legislation denouncing the plan, and some have penned bills expressly forbidding compliance. Several states have begun making arrangements for the new requirements -- four have passed legislation applauding the measure -- but even they may have trouble meeting the act's deadline. The cards would be mandatory for all ""federal purposes,"" which include boarding an airplane or walking into a federal building, nuclear facility or national park, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told the National Conference of State Legislatures last week. Citizens in states that don't comply with the new rules will have to use passports for federal purposes. ""For terrorists, travel documents are like weapons,"" Chertoff said. ""We do have a right and an obligation to see that those licenses reflect the identity of the person who's presenting it."" Chertoff said the Real ID program is essential to national security because there are presently 8,000 types of identification accepted to enter the United States. ""It is simply unreasonable to expect our border inspectors to be able to detect forgeries on documents that range from baptismal certificates from small towns in Texas to cards that purport to reflect citizenship privileges in a province somewhere in Canada,"" he said. Chertoff attended the conference in Boston, Massachusetts, in part to allay states' concerns, but he had few concrete answers on funding. The Department of Homeland Security, which estimates state and federal costs could reach $23.1 billion over 10 years, is looking for ways to lessen the burden on states, he said. On the recent congressional front, however, Chertoff could point only to an amendment killed in the Senate last month that would've provided $300 million for the program. ""There's going to be an irreducible expense that falls on you, and that's part of the shared responsibility,"" Chertoff told the state legislators. Bill Walsh, senior legal fellow for the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank that supports the Real ID Act, said states shouldn't be pushing for more federal dollars because, ultimately, that will mean more federal oversight -- and many complaints about cost coincide with complaints about the federal government overstepping its bounds. ""They are only being asked to do what they should've already done to protect their citizens,"" Walsh said, blaming arcane software and policies at state motor vehicle departments for what he called ""a tremendous trafficking in state driver's licenses."" The NCSL is calling Real ID an ""unfunded mandate"" that could cost states up to $14 billion over the next decade, but for which only $40 million has been federally approved. The group is demanding Congress pony up $1 billion for startup costs by year's end or scrap the proposal altogether. Everyone must visit DMV by 2013 . The Real ID Act repealed a provision in the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act calling for state and federal officials to examine security standards for driver's licenses. It called instead for states to begin issuing new federal licenses, lasting no longer than eight years, by May 11, 2008, unless they are granted an extension. It also requires all 245 million license and state ID holders to visit their local departments of motor vehicles and apply for a Real ID by 2013. Applicants must bring a photo ID, birth certificate, proof of Social Security number and proof of residence, and states must maintain and protect massive databases housing the information. NCSL spokesman Bill Wyatt said the requirements are ""almost physically impossible."" States will have to build new facilities, secure those facilities and shell out for additional equipment and personnel. Those costs are going to fall back on the American taxpayer, he said. It might be in the form of a new transportation, motor vehicle or gasoline tax.  Or you might find it tacked on to your next state tax bill. In Texas, Wyatt said, one official told him that without federal funding, the Lone Star State might have to charge its citizens more than $100 for a license. ""We kind of feel like the way they went about this is backwards,"" Wyatt said, explaining that states would have appreciated more input into the process. ""Each state has its own unique challenges and these are best addressed at state levels. A one-size-fits-all approach to driver's licenses doesn't necessarily work."" Many states have revolted. The governors of Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Washington have signed bills refusing to comply with the act. Six others have passed bills and/or resolutions expressing opposition, and 15 have similar legislation pending. Though the NCSL says most states' opposition stems from the lack of funding, some states cited other reasons for resisting the initiative. New Hampshire passed a House bill opposing the program and calling Real ID ""contrary and repugnant"" to the state and federal constitutions. A Colorado House resolution dismissed Real ID by expressing support for the war on terror but ""not at the expense of essential civil rights and liberties of citizens of this country."" Privacy concerns raised . Colorado and New Hampshire lawmakers are not alone. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation say the IDs and supporting databases -- which Chertoff said would eventually be federally interconnected -- will infringe on privacy. EFF says on its Web site that the information in the databases will lay the groundwork for ""a wide range of surveillance activities"" by government and businesses that ""will be able to easily read your private information"" because of the bar code required on each card. The databases will provide a one-stop shop for identity thieves, adds the ACLU on its Web site, and the U.S. ""surveillance society"" and private sector will have access to the system ""for the routine tracking, monitoring and regulation of individuals' movements and activities."" The civil liberties watchdog dubs the IDs ""internal passports"" and claims it wouldn't be long before office buildings, gas stations, toll booths, subways and buses begin accessing the system. But Chertoff told legislators last week that DHS has no intention of creating a federal database, and Walsh, of the Heritage Foundation, said the ACLU's allegations are disingenuous. States will be permitted to share data only when validating someone's identity, Walsh said. ""The federal government wouldn't have any greater access to driver's license information than it does today,"" Walsh said. States have the right to refuse to comply with the program, he said, and they also have the right to continue issuing IDs and driver's licenses that don't meet Real ID requirements. But, Walsh said, ""any state that's refusing to implement this key recommendation by the 9/11 Commission, and whose state driver's licenses are as a result used in another terrorist attack, should be held responsible."" State reaction to Real ID has not been all negative. Four states have passed bills or resolutions expressing approval for the program, and 13 states have similar legislation pending (Several states have pending pieces of legislation both applauding and opposing Real ID). Chertoff said there would be repercussions for states choosing not to comply. ""This is not a mandate,"" Chertoff said. ""A state doesn't have to do this, but if the state doesn't have -- at the end of the day, at the end of the deadline -- Real ID-compliant licenses then the state cannot expect that those licenses will be accepted for federal purposes.""

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova was forced to call on all her resilience to ensure her place in the semifinals of the French Open Tuesday. The World No.8 endured a nightmare opening set, losing it 6-1 to Spain's Garbine Muguruza, before launching an impressive fightback. Sharapova, who was beaten in last year's final, won the second set 7-5 before taking the decider 6-1. The Russian, who won at Roland Garros in 2012, will now face Canada's rising star Eugenie Bouchard. ""I came across a player playing with such confidence and I knew it was going to be a tough match,"" Sharapova told the WTA website. ""I had a tough start but luckily I had a good finish. ""She was playing so aggressive at the start, but also I wasn't really helping myself with my movement or serving."" Sharapova, seeded seventh, made a dreadful start to the contest and fell 4-0 behind before finally winning a game. Murguruza, who defeated defending champion Serena Williams 6-2 6-2 earlier in the tournament, played with a verve and quality which belied her age. After conceding the first set, she slowly got to grips with 21-year-old Muguruza, who was playing in her first ever grand slam quarterfinal. There was heartbreak for another Spaniard in the other quarterfinal after Carla Suarez Navarro threw away a 4-1 advantage in the final set. Bouchard, ranked 16th in the world, appeared to be heading out of the tournament but fought back to take the match 7-6 2-6 7-5. It is a second successive grand slam semifinal for Bouchard, who was beaten in straight sets by Li Na at the Australian Open earlier this year. ""I want to thank everyone here for creating such a great atmosphere,"" Bouchard said after the match. ""I didn't expect to play such a tough match. She played really well and is a great clay court player. ""At the end of the third set I thought I was getting the upper hand began to believe that I could win. ""I'm just excited to be in the semifinals and to stay a little longer in Paris. I'm just going to enjoy myself in the semifinals."" Djokovic . Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic moved into the semifinals of the men's draw with a straight sets win over Canada's Milos Raonic. The World No.2, who has never won at Roland Garros, prevailed 7-5 7-6 6-4 to set up a clash with Latvia's Ernests Gulbis. The Serb will make his 22nd appearance in a grand slam sem-final and his 14th in his last 15 major appearances. Djokovic is now just two wins away from becoming the eighth man in history to complete the career grand slam. But standing in his way is the exciting Gulbis, who will compete in his first ever grand slam semifinal. Gulbis, seeded 18th, overcame Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-2 6-4 to build on his impressive victory over 17- time grand slam winner Roger Federer. ""It's very special,"" Gulbis said in an on-court interview.

"(Wired) -- Growing up in Colorado, Calvin Seibert spent a lot of time at construction sites. Back then, the artist was thousands of miles away from an ocean, but that didn't stop him from building castles out of the massive mounds of sand. ""In the evening when everyone left for work and before the sun set, I'd find a pile of sand and start making stuff,"" he recalls. A few decades later, Seibert is still making sand castles, though today they tend to be much, much more sophisticated. His castles resemble less the complicated towers and moats of fairy tales and more the brutalist structures of his architectural inspirations like Paul Rudolph, Gottfried Bohm and Giovanni Michelucci. ""I always had an affinity for architecture which I attribute to growing up in a neighborhood and town that was constantly under construction,"" he says. ""As I was becoming more aware of the architecture in the wider world, Brutalism was one of the styles of the moment."" Read more: Incredible historical photos from one of the world's best museums . With their exacting geometric shapes and sharp edges, you might think his sculptures require molds or other helpful gizmos. But Seibert, who's fabricated sculptures for years as an artist's assistant, has a surprisingly simple tool kit: A 5-gallon pail to haul water and sand, a plastic placemat for leveling surfaces and a little chunk of plastic for getting those sharp edges. ""It's literally a plastic $1.50 tool you pick up at a hardware store,"" he says. The key to getting those precise shapes (aside from lots of practice, Seibert says) is making sure the texture of the sand is just right. Sand that's too dry is weak and crumbly. Too wet, and it's hard to shape. There's no perfect ratio, but Seibert explains the ideal texture is similar to the sand you'd find if you dig about 6 inches down on the beach. ""It's easy to pack and will hold long enough to maintain the form."" Seibert shapes everything by hand, roughly packing each piece of a structure and then refining and leveling it with his simple tools. This is an entirely different method from the elaborate sandcastles you see in competitions, which are actually made by building an enormous solid block of sand then carving into it like a sculptor does with a hunk of stone. Carving means dragging and dragging means a rougher, more jagged surface. Seibert's castles are perfectly smooth, like the top of an hand-sanded piece of wood. ""I'm really just packing things together like a child might build a sandcastle,"" he says. ""You get a much smoother surface by doing it this way."" Read more: Striking Photos of the Rooms Where VIPs Shape History . He tends to build his castle right at the edge of the tide, close enough to have easy access to water in case he has to dampen his piles of sand, but far enough to ensure the structures are safe during the building process. Seibert says he's not attached to his creations, in fact, he likes the idea that they're temporary. ""It's about the process,"" he says. ""Building 'sand castles' is a bit of a test. Nature will always be against you and time is always running out. Having to think fast and to bring it all together in the end is what I like about it."" Each summer, Seibert has followed a routine: ""I walk to Penn Station, take the train out to Jones Beach, I walk for 40 minutes so I'm so far out I can build a castle and have it be there several days later because no one's bothered it,"" he explains. But this year things will be a little different. The artist is devoting his entire summer to sand projects, and he might even end up with a book of his work sometime later this year. ""I'm actually going to spend this summer doing nothing but building sandcastles,"" he says. ""I won't be working, except on the beach."" Read more on WIRED: .

"(CNN) -- For about a week, the nation's Catholic bishops enjoyed some measure of their bygone political clout. The bishops launched a vigorous grassroots campaign to protest a rule from the Obama administration's health care mandate that would force many Catholic institutions to cover birth control through their employee health plans. Catholic churchgoers have seen such campaigns attempted before, with bishops issuing stinging denunciations that are repeated in church publications and in letters read to parishioners at every Mass. But this time, to the surprise of many, the bishops' effort seemed to work. President Barack Obama quickly modified the rule. He didn't satisfy the bishops -- but still, the clergymen had upset the political calculus that they no longer affect Catholic voters. The bishops were able to wield influence because their message against the contraception mandate was framed in a way that appealed to a broad spectrum of Catholics. For moderates and liberals, there were calls to freedom and conscience, rather than blunt declarations to heed ecclesial authority. For conservatives, there was the opportunity to circle the wagons against secularism. But if the bishops insist on coming across as shrill and partisan, as some are wont to do, they'll wind up once again preaching to half the choir. Moderate and liberal Catholics won't stand behind the bishops if they perceive a partisan position. And it won't take much to trigger that reaction because certain bishops were transparently opposed to Obama during the 2008 election campaign, and many more of them later maligned the University of Notre Dame for granting the president an honorary degree. I noticed a letter to the editor in the diocesan newspaper in Brooklyn, where I live, that captures the unease I believe a good number of Catholics feel. The writer said she understood the church's position on the birth-control mandate, but she practically pleaded with the editor, who had accused the Obama administration of pushing socialism, to take a less polarizing tone. If the bishops really want to gain back some of the clout they used to hold, they would do well to consider the community organizing tactics that their own parishes have adopted in many poor urban neighborhoods. It is an approach that relies heavily on building consensus. Guided by the writings of Saul Alinsky, coalitions of houses of worship have organized around specific issues, such as a plan to build low-cost housing. The community organizers' first step was to secure the enthusiastic support of parishioners, demonstrated through massive rallies. Once pastors really do speak for their people, they are then in a position to demand that elected officials of whatever party support their agenda. Obama once was a community organizer for just such a church-funded coalition, working from a Catholic rectory on Chicago's South Side. Like the Chicago politicians he encountered as a young man, Obama knows that a church's grassroots campaign is only as effective as it is unified. I'm not sure how many bishops know that.

Im Dong Hyun is legally classified as blind and cannot see out of his right eye, but it did not stop the two-time gold medalist bettering his own leading 72-arrow score in the qualification competition at Lord's cricket ground in the British capital. London 2012: Results and Schedule . The 26-year-old, who struggles to read a newspaper, scored 699, which put him top of the standings ahead of compatriots Kim Bubmin and Oh Jin Hyek. The efforts of the trio also delivered a second world record, as South Korea registered a landmark combined total of 2,087 for the team event -- a discipline the Asian nation has won gold in at the last two Games. The event at the home of English cricket was held behind closed doors, but it did not stop fans queuing in an attempt to gain entry to the stadium. ""Tickets have not been advertised or sold by (Olympic organizers) LOCOG for the archery ranking event,"" read a statement from the venue. We have always made it clear that the preliminary rounds are not open for spectators. ""There are a number of unofficial websites claiming to sell tickets, we therefore advise people to be extremely cautious and vigilant when attempting to buy tickets and only purchase from an official source."" A non-ticketed event that people can attend is the cycling road race, which is a 250-kilometer trek from Box Hill in the English county of Surrey to the Buckingham Palace in the heart of London. Spectators will be able to line certain areas of the route free of charge to cheer on British hopefuls such as Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins and sprint star Mark Cavendish in Saturday's men's race, while the women compete on Sunday.

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- The world sees Ukraine in turmoil, a country divided between Russian speakers and Ukrainian nationalists, its towns and cities roiled by occupations, its highways dotted with improvised barricades. The reality is rather different. Only one town in eastern Ukraine -- Slovyansk, is truly held by pro-Russian protesters, with roadblocks at several entrances. Its defenders are a mixture of the ""men in green,"" dozens of well-armed fighters wearing fatigues and balaclavas, teenagers looking for some action and what might be termed the Baboushka Brigade, middle-aged women with flashing gold teeth who decry the Kiev ""junta"" and see Vladimir Putin as their savior (and the prospect of Russian ownership as bringing improved pensions). A relatively compact town of narrow streets, with several river crossings at its outskirts, Slovyansk is easy to defend. The active pro-Russian groups there -- civilian and in uniform(s) -- seem to number no more than several hundred. Of the 130,000 inhabitants, many seem sympathetic to the pro-Russian protesters -- or more accurately hostile to the government in Kiev, which they see as dominated by nationalists who will sell out to the European Union and NATO. But most people go about their lives almost oblivious to the upheaval. Weddings take place, people sit by the lake eating kebabs and pizza, the outdoor market bustles. It doesn't feel like Sarajevo, and the warning by the self-declared mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomaryev, that it could be the next Stalingrad, one of the defining battles of World War II, seems surreal. Ponomaryev says Slovyansk is under siege by the Ukrainian army, but Ukrainian troops have done little more than approach roadblocks on the outskirts -- only to withdraw. Trucks negotiate the slalom of checkpoints on their way to and from the Russian border. Commerce can't stop for the rebellion. And a few miles away, sightseers take in Svyatohirsk's historic monastery, with its gleaming blue and gold steeples. In Donetsk, the region's capital and Ukraine's fifth-largest city, up-market fashion stores are busy; the leaders of the Ukrainian football league, Shakhtar Donetsk, play home games as scheduled; cafes are full in the spring sunshine; the airport is open and functioning normally. You would only know something was abnormal by approaching the regional government building, an 11-story slab of concrete surrounded by tires and festooned with Russian and Donbass flags and less than complimentary banners about NATO and U.S. President Barack Obama. Inside there may be a couple of hundred pro-Russian protesters at any one time, including the leadership of the Donbass People's Republic. Outside are a similar number --- supporters, onlookers, miners in orange helmets who fear that if Ukraine joins the European Union they'll be out of a job because of more stringent health and safety regulations. The rest of the city works, worships and worries about the political paralysis that has engulfed Ukraine. Of a city of just under 1 million, a few hundred are involved in political agitation. In Mariupol, Kramatorsk, Horlivka and other towns across the Donetsk region where government buildings and police stations have been taken over, there is little sense of momentum in the pro-Russian protests. In Horlivka, a gritty industrial town north of Donetsk, a platoon of the Babushka Brigade stood beneath Lenin's statue outside the sleepy City Hall last week, ready to tell anyone who would listen that all they wanted was a referendum on their future, the chance to be free from the ""fascists"" in Kiev. But there do seem to be more weapons in circulation, compared to two weeks ago. At a roadblock north of Slovyansk, on the main road to Kharkiv, a CNN team was briefly inspected last week by a couple of teenagers waving hand guns apparently liberated from a police armory. And there are other ominous signs. Until now, the rarity of pro-Ukrainian rallies in the east has prevented street clashes. But a pro-Ukrainian event attended by several hundred people on Monday was attacked by pro-Russians wielding bats and clubs --- was the first political violence of any consequence in the city for more than three weeks. On the same day, the mayor of Kharkiv was shot and wounded, and pro-Russian ""men in green"" seized another town hall at Kostyantynivka, near Slovyansk. Still, words like uprising or insurgency, let alone civil war, the phrase sometimes deployed by Russia, don't really describe events in eastern Ukraine. Much depends on whether pro-Ukrainian groups in the east are prepared to mobilize in the next month, during which the ""referendum"" being organized by pro-Russian protesters will take place to decide whether Donetsk and Luhansk should leave Ukraine (May 11), followed by Ukraine's presidential election two weeks later. If they do, then the potential for unrest grows. The numbers involved so far --- on either side --- suggest neither widespread bloodshed nor a decisive resolution of the crisis are imminent. The Ukrainian government --- short of special forces and equipment --- seems incapable of reasserting its authority in towns where pro-Russian protesters have hoisted their flags. The debate rages about how far the Russian government is exploiting, stoking or wildly exaggerating anti-Kiev resentment. To many observers, President Vladimir Putin seems intent on keeping the Ukrainian government off balance rather than invading. Cliff Kupchan, of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, says ""his visceral desire to influence Ukraine's trajectory will remain, and he will pursue his goals of securing Ukraine's geopolitical neutrality and political federalization with unabated vigor."" His long-term goal, says Kupchan, is ""grabbing territory through proxies and generally destabilizing Eastern Ukraine, thereby achieving de facto 'federalization' through Russian influence over the east."" Eastern Ukraine is as much, perhaps more, a battleground between East and West as a battle on the ground. The rhetoric flies in both directions. The Russian foreign ministry accuses the Ukrainian government of building detention centers resembling fascist concentration camps for ""disloyal citizens."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague says Moscow is ""undermining its own influence in its neighbourhood, steadily disconnecting Russia from the international community and damaging Russia's own prosperity and security over the long-term."" In the game of geopolitical poker, the U.S. and Europe have added modestly to the list of Russian individuals and companies sanctioned, hoping the markets will do the rest by further punishing the Russian stock market and the rouble. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, responds by calling the measures meaningless, shameful and disgusting. Who holds the winning card? The Russian writer, Vladimir Sorokin, a veteran observer of politics in his country and rare voice of dissent, admits to being at a loss, because Putin's intentions are impossible to read. Writing in the New York Review of Books, Sorokin says: ""Unpredictability has always been Russia's calling card, but since the Ukrainian events, it has grown to unprecedented levels: no one knows what will happen to our country in a month, in a week, or the day after tomorrow."" Ukrainians could say the same.","World sees Ukraine in turmoil, but reality is different, writes CNN's Tim Lister .

"New York (CNN) -- A billboard has sparked controversy in New York after an anti-abortion group erected a sign focused exclusively on African-American abortion rates. The sign -- which was paid for by an organization called Life Always -- reads: ""The most dangerous place for an African-American is in the womb."" The billboard -- located roughly a half mile from a Planned Parenthood facility in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood -- features an African-American girl. ""They're attacking women for choosing abortion while simultaneously destroying family planning,"" said spokeswoman Mary Alice Carr for the New York-based National Institute for Reproductive Health. ""Their hypocrisy is as large and as obnoxious as this billboard."" But Pastor Stephen Broden, a Life Always board member, told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday that ""it's hard to celebrate Black History Month"" with abortion ""hanging over our community."" ""Abortion is out-pacing life in our community"" and he said the billboard's message is meant to be a ""provocative"" way to illustrate the problem. African-Americans tend to have high abortion rates when compared to other demographic groups, according to Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based research center for sexual and reproductive health. The disparity is in part attributed to a ""lack of adequate services"" in many black communities, which ""has resulted in more unintended pregnancies,"" Wind said. According to the Life Always website, the move is an attempt ""to raise public awareness of Life issues through advertising and raise truths about Life issues to educate and empower individuals."" The sign is part of a national campaign where more billboards will appear over the next couple of months across the country, Life Always spokeswoman Marissa Gabrysch said. Critics say the message is misleading. ""The issue is here they are doing a campaign, targeting one group of women and making them feel guilty and shameful about family choices that they are making,"" Carr said. ""You can't take a woman and lift her out of her experience."" But Rev. Derek A McCoy, another Life Always board member, told reporters something needs to be done about abortion in the black community and this is ""calling attention to a dramatic event."" ""This is a truth and tragedy,"" he said. Broden said ""The child (in the billboard) was selected for her innocence.""","A New York billboard focused on exclusively on African-American abortion rates .

"BEIJING (CNN) -- Thousands of passengers were stranded Tuesday morning after dozens of early morning flights were either canceled or delayed due to a thick, dark cloud of smog that rolled through the Chinese capital. The haze prompted 34 flight cancellations and delayed 98 others after visibility dropped to less than 200 meters in the airspace surrounding Beijing, state media reported. Air carriers resumed normal flight schedules as of 10 a.m. (local), according to Xinhua. But the city's air quality continued to be listed as ""fair."" The U.S. Embassy, which reports pollution levels on its Twitter feed, said the accumulation of air particles was ""beyond index"" for most of the morning, which means the pollution exceeded the scale used to measure it. The U.S. Embassy and Chinese officials use different systems to measure air pollution. The U.S. Embassy's air quality monitor includes smaller particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. The U.S. Consulate General in Guangzhou, China, explains that these smaller particles ""are believed to pose the largest health risks"" and ""are small enough to get into the lungs and even the blood stream."" Last month, Beijing's Capital International Airport canceled more than 200 incoming and outgoing flights and delayed more than 125 others because of smog. Analysts have blamed the thick haze on rapid urbanization and industrialization. Beijing, for instance, burned some 27 million tons of coal in 2010, according to state-run media. Despite efforts to limit the number cars with an auto-plate lottery, it's estimated that Beijing now has over 5 million cars, up from about 3.5 million in 2008. Pollution is more acute because of the sheer size of the city's population (17 million) and the rapid speed of its economic growth, experts say. CNN's Haolan Hong contributed to this report .","Thousands of passengers were stranded Tuesday morning due to a thick dark cloud of smog .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot, the suspect in a young woman's slaying this week in Peru and previously considered a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba, was captured Thursday in Chile, authorities said. Van der Sloot is the main suspect in this week's slaying of 21-year-old Stephany Flores Ramirez, who was found Wednesday in a Lima, Peru, hotel room registered to the Dutch man. Chilean police told CNN that paperwork showed that van der Sloot entered Chile on Wednesday. Peruvian Interior Minister Octavio Salazar Miranda said Thursday that Peru has made arrangements with Interpol to extradite van der Sloot. Interpol confirmed that Chile will send van der Sloot back to Peru. Van der Sloot also faces an arrest warrant on charges of extortion and wire fraud in Alabama, U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance said Thursday. The charges are unrelated to the killing of a Peruvian woman, and deal with an attempt to sell details about Holloway for $250,000, Vance said. Van der Sloot, 23, was traveling alone in a taxi near the Chilean central coastal city of Vina del Mar when he was detained, said Douglas Rodriguez, spokesman for the Chilean Investigative Police. Van der Sloot was transported Thursday afternoon to police headquarters in Santiago, Chile's capital. TV images showed him emerging from a black police SUV at the police station. His hair, which had been black in previous images, was red and worn in a close-cropped crew cut. In Peru, a wake was held Thursday in Lima for Flores, who was scheduled to be buried later in the day. An uncle of Natalee Holloway said he was saddened by the Flores family's loss. ""We are disappointed that Joran has been able to do this to another young girl,"" Paul Reynolds told CNN. ""He was not held accountable for what happened to Natalee and as a result has been able to repeat his actions. Sorry this other family has to go through the same thing we have. Van der Sloot, who was arrested in connection with Holloway's disappearance in 2005 but later released, has denied any involvement in her case. There is ""incriminating evidence"" linking van der Sloot to the killing of Flores, said Peruvian criminal investigator Cesar Guardia Vasquez. The woman's bludgeoned body was found in Room 309 of the Hotel Tac in the Miraflores section of Lima, police said. She suffered blunt trauma to the head, breaking her neck, and to her torso and back, Peruvian police said Thursday. Van der Sloot had been staying at the hotel since arriving from Colombia on May 14, police said. Room 309 was booked in his name, authorities said. A hotel guest and an employee witnessed the pair entering the hotel room together at 5 a.m. Sunday, Guardia said. Police have video of van der Sloot and Flores together the previous night at the Atlantic City Casino in Lima, he said. Two Peruvian cab drivers said in an interview on CNN affiliate America TV that they drove a man matching van der Sloot's description to a city on the other side of the Chilean border. ""He paid me and I took him to Arica, to the border,"" cab driver Oswaldo Aparcana said. The man sat in the front seat and smoked many cigarettes, Aparcana said. The passenger told the cabbies he used to live in Aruba, said the other driver, Carlos Alberto Uribe. The victim's father said he believes van der Sloot is responsible for the young woman's death. ""We have all the evidence to show that the killer is this man,"" businessman and race-car driver Ricardo Flores told CNN en Español. But van der Sloot's former attorney, Joseph Tacopina, told CNN it was too early to reach any conclusions. ""I just think we need to take a step back before we get to the 'I told you so' stage, and let's see what the evidence is here,"" Tacopina said Thursday. Tacopina said he is not representing van der Sloot and no longer has a good relationship with the family. Holloway, the Alabama teenager, disappeared May 30, 2005, five years to the day since the hotel videotape that officials say showed van der Sloot and Flores going into his hotel room. Both women are reported to have met van der Sloot at a night spot. Ricardo Flores said police found his daughter's car about 50 blocks from the hotel. Inside the car, he said, authorities found pills like those used in date rapes. Ricardo Flores said he did not believe his daughter knew the Dutch citizen beforehand. Both of them speak English and they struck up conversation at the casino, he said. Interpol had alerted its office in Chile and other bordering countries of the case and placed them on alert in case van der Sloot tried to leave that country, Peruvian Interpol Interim Director Gerson Ortiz told CNN. Van der Sloot was arrested in Aruba in 2005 along with two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe, in connection with Holloway's disappearance. They were later released. In 2007, they were arrested a second time after Aruba's then-chief prosecutor, Hans Mos, said he had received new evidence in the case. Van der Sloot, who was attending college in the Netherlands, was brought back to Aruba. But judges ruled the new evidence -- which included an Internet chat the same day Holloway disappeared in which one of the three youths said she was dead -- was not enough to keep them jailed. In 2008, prosecutors sought unsuccessfully to arrest van der Sloot a third time after a videotape surfaced on Dutch television. In it, van der Sloot tells a man he considered to be his friend that he had sex with Holloway on the beach after leaving the nightclub, then she ""started shaking"" and lost consciousness. He said he panicked when he could not resuscitate her and called a friend who had a boat. The two put Holloway's body in the boat, he said, and then he went home. The friend told him the next day that he had carried the body out and dumped it in the ocean. But an Aruba court ruled there was not enough evidence to re-arrest him. Aruban prosecutors said authorities had met with van der Sloot in the Netherlands, but in a two-hour interview he denied any role in Holloway's disappearance. CNN's Beth Carey contributed to this report.","Extradition to Peru arranged, say Chilean interior minister, Interpol .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Gunny, a devoted Peninsula Beverly Hills guest, often visits the posh hotel, and the staff joyously greets him as he strides along the lobby's marble floor. Retiring to his room, Gunny finds a specially monogrammed towel beside his bed and sits down to a grilled New York sirloin and scrambled eggs with aged Tillamook cheddar on bone china. And when he needs styling, the hotel's Rolls Royce shuttles him to the salon. All pretty normal for a 5-star hotel -- except Gunny is a golden retriever. ""Like their owners, pets should have a chance to get away from their normal routine,"" said the hotel's head concierge, James Little. Travel + Leisure: America's best dog-friendly hotels . It's not uncommon for a hotel to be pet-friendly these days. ""America is more pet obsessed than ever,"" said Andrea Arden, pet expert for the Today Show. ""We see them as part as part of the family."" But some luxury properties go to such extremes to cater to pets that the line between man and man's best friend is a bit, well, fuzzy. Pet bathrobes, pet massages, and pet treadmills are becoming practically de rigueur at five-star hotels these days. Vermont's Spa at Topnotch, for example, has doggy Reiki. Hotels are also competing for Fido's affection with food. The Mandarin Oriental, Miami offers grilled beef tenderloin, while Los Cabos' Las Ventanas al ParaÃ­so features made-to-order dishes for pets with special dietary needs. The list of extras doesn't stop with food, especially for chains like Loews, which has taken pet pleasing to new heights. When the surf's up at Loews Coronado Bay Resort, in California, pups can join Su'ruff Camp, where poodles and bulldogs alike can take a shot at catching a wave. And if you've dreamed of your pup becoming the next Britney Spears, the Loews Vanderbilt Hotel in Nashville offers voice-coaching lessons and the chance to cut a CD. So what gives? Aren't we recovering from a recession? ""With the economy in bad shape, people cut back on their own luxuries, but not on their pets,"" explains Arden. ""For many, indulging their pet is more rewarding than indulging themselves."" But some of these programs are focused on giving back as well. The Hotel Indigo Atlanta-Midtown donated $1 from each signature drink ordered during its ""Canine Cocktail Hours"" this spring to help a local dog park. The hotel even invited the Atlanta Humane Society to bring four-legged friends to the event to encourage adoptions. Some of these pets may even become hotel guests. ""There's nothing like when you've had a bad day and you come home to your dog smiling and beaming unconditional love,"" says Peninsula Beverly Hills concierge James Little. ""Why shouldn't you have that when you're in a hotel?"" Travel + Leisure: Weirdest animal smuggling incidents . The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park . Before arrival, the staff contacts all guests to see if they have special needs or requests -- of course, this includes four-legged visitors as well. But there's plenty that comes with the Pampered Pooch package, too, like wrought-iron pet beds, 22-karat gold plated ID tags, and home-baked dog treats. And when water is pouring down from the sky, both pet and owner can borrow Burberry raincoats. Las Ventanas al ParaÃ­so, Los Cabos . A stress-reducing neck massage is the perfect antidote to a long flight, no matter whether that neck is human or canine. And at this Mexican resort, pets can also enjoy the beach or pool in a portable pet cabana. When it's time to dine, the Canine Delights menu (served in metallic bowls with faux gem stones) features items like Rin Tin Tin (shredded braised beef and steamed rice) or made-to-order dishes for pets with special dietary needs. Loews Hotels, Nashville, Coronado . Sure, there's gourmet room service and luxurious bedding at Nashville's Vanderbilt Hotel, but you can also have your pup cut a CD in a professional recording session. After being shuttled to a recording studio in a limo, dogs work with a voice coach (!) and howl along with a musician or bark to their favorite karaoke tune. It's part of the chain's Vacation for Pets learning camps, which includes Su'ruff Camp at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort & Spa in San Diego where pups can learn to catch a wave. The Peninsula Hotels, Beverly Hills, New York, Chicago . Humans have ergonomic chairs, so why shouldn't pets have the same for their bowls? That's just one of the perks at the Peninsula Beverly Hills, where they also receive monogrammed paw-printed towels and scented poop bags. At the Peninsula Chicago, treats include special room-service dishes like the Spaniel Spinach Salad with corn and chopped beef or Tabby Tuna Tartare. And the Peninsula New York offers a personalized menu option with the pet's preferred brand of food. Kimpton Hotels, New York, Denver . Side-by-side massages are usually meant for two humans, but at New York's Muse Hotel, the ""Hers and Furs Pet-icure"" the second creature should be canine. Kimpton properties have always featured a special devotion to animals, and that dedication has only grown; today, each property welcomes the pet on the lobby activities board, and many have a resident pup. At the Denver's Hotel Monaco it's Tulo -- a cocker spaniel ""Canine Concierge"" named after Troy Tulowitski, shortstop for the Colorado Rockies. Travel + Leisure: Most outrageous hotel concierge requests . One&Only Palmilla, Los Cabos . Your pet may not need a passport to travel to Mexico, but that doesn't mean he doesn't want one. Hotel staff will take your pup's photo for a ""Dog Passport"" (written in, um, ""Paw-lish"") and marked with a One&Only Palmilla passport stamp. Once you both make it through immigration, Fido will find gourmet menu offerings like organic roasted chicken, beef tenderloin, and steamed Pacific salmon. Pets can even relax in poolside doggie cabanas. Rome Cavalieri, Waldorf-Astoria Hotel & Resorts, Rome . There are no toga-clad waiters serving your dog grapes, but the hotel does offer four-course pet meals of fish, game, or vegetable soup in Gucci dog bowls (and on golden trays to boot). When it's a little chilly in the Eternal City, order an Odilia Prisco Dog Haute Couture cashmere sweater with your pup's name written in rhinestones. But Fido may not want to wear it during his visit to La Domus Aventina, a nearby dog spa, for his green-clay and aloe vera skin-and-hair-revitalizing massage. Hotel Indigo Atlanta-Midtown, Atlanta . Even pets have stressful days and (like their owners) need a happy hour. So every Thursday night this spring, this hotel obliged, serving chicken, steak, or vegan options for pups. Humans joined in, of course, and when they ordered one of the Hotel Indigo's signature drinks (a Greyhound, Salty Dog, or Yellow Lab), $1 was donated to the local Piedmont Park Dog Park. Mandarin Oriental, Miami . Four-legged guests receive a luxurious plush bed, a golden Mandarin Oriental collar tag, treats, bottled water, and a bone-shaped place mat. But so they don't go hungry, culinary choices include grilled beef tenderloin, organic chicken breast, and gourmet desserts. Afterward, pups can work out with a certified trainer at the hotel's Doggie Boot Camp and focus on issues like excessive barking, jumping, or housebreaking. And for the stylish dog, there are bathrobes with the Mandarin Oriental logo emblazoned in blue or pink Swarovski crystals. The Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa, Phoenix . Who doesn't like welcome gifts -- especially if they include a cookie, commemorative bowl, and placemat? The Biltmore also features a special room-service menu with Zen Yo, a hearty vegetable stir-fry with poached eggs, steamed brown rice, and salmon, which is perfect fuel for taking your pet on a walk around the property's 39 landscaped acres (the hotel provides a map of the trails). Topnotch Resort and Spa, Stowe, Vermont . Reiki isn't just for humans. Here, pups can get a ""Rover Reiki"" massage on a magnetic dog bed. ""Usually dogs are excited but calm down quickly as the therapist starts to work on them,"" says Alexandra Sharpe, the resort's spa director. ""At the end of the treatment the dogs are usually relaxed and sleepy."" Fortunately, they can then retire to an ""Aero Paws"" inflatable dog bed wrapped in soft fleece covers, with Mini-Bone cookies at turndown. Travel + Leisure: General travel secrets .

As it happens, there's more to the island nation than just sun and sea. For four years, it has also played host to the Seychelles International Carnival, an international event which even in its infancy manages to attract over 1,500 participants from across the globe.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Smog in Beijing is now so bad and such a regular occurrence that the country's civil aviation authority will require the pilots of even small commercial airlines to be able to perform ""blind landings."" The move is aimed at easing delays at Beijing Capital International Airport, which has had the worst flight delays out of 35 international airports. According to China's state-run China Daily, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) will from January 1 require pilots flying from China's 10 busiest airports to Beijing to be able to use instrument-landing system on hazy days with a visibility of 400 meters. ""It is part of a series of measures the administration took recently to raise flights' on-time performance,"" a CAAC source told the China Daily. Large passenger aircraft from international airlines require their pilots to have a ""blind landing category 2"" certification allowing them to land in poor visibility. This was one of the reasons, the source pointed out, that international airlines suffered fewer delays. The latest bout of smog in Beijing and Shanghai has led to the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights, stranding passengers and creating chaos at airports. Chinese media reports said that while 80% of the pilots at Spring Airlines, half of China Eastern and most of Juneyao Airlines pilots had received training, only larger airports such as those in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xian were equipped with ground systems that allowed for blind landings. A pilot with Cathay Pacific, who did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak, said that modern jetliners can be brought to land in zero visibility. ""The greatest limitation is really being able to taxi off the runway,"" he told CNN, adding that modern aircraft had three systems on-board that could auto-land a plane. He said training in these systems involved identifying deficiencies or failures in any of the systems and establishing at what point the pilots would have to abort a landing. He added that the problems that smog and pollution created for aviation was not just isolated to China and that other countries had also struggled with the problem. ""The whole concept of auto-land was developed in England in the 1960s for the fog that London gets and on top of that all the pollution that they got at the time,"" he said. ""This is just the same technology moving into the industrial revolution that's happening in China at the moment.""","Chinese pilots for even small airlines will be required to get 'blind landing' training due to smog .

"London (CNN) -- Lee Ridley staggers onto the stage at London's Soho Theatre and squints into the darkness at the sell-out crowd. It's the first paid gig in his short career as a stand-up comedian. The microphone stands in the spotlight in the centre of the stage but Lee doesn't approach it. He doesn't need to because he has no voice. Under the stage name ""Lost Voice Guy,"" Lee is fast becoming the talk of the town. Born with cerebral palsy he has been unable to speak since birth. Off-stage he uses a somewhat cumbersome machine which resembles an electric typewriter to convert his words to speech. On stage he uses an iPad with a text-to-voice app. Lost Voice Guy thanks the audience for their warm welcome and adds: ""I haven't felt this important since the doctors said I was going to be a special child."" Encouraged by the laughter he continues, referring to his difficulty walking. ""I know what you were thinking when I walked on. It's OK I'm used to it."" Having apparently played on the sympathy of the audience he switches the joke. ""You thought 'here comes another ****** with an iPad.' Well I'm not. I'm a disabled ****** with an iPad -- the difference being I paid for mine with my benefit [welfare] money."" Don't tell David Cameron. He still thinks I cannot walk, can barely see and have a problem with my bladder. Unfortunately for those closest to the stage -- one of those facts is actually true."" He's into his stride now and has the crowd on his side. ""In case you were in any doubt I really am disabled. It's not just really good acting and I'm definitely not just in it for the parking space. ""When I realized I would never be able to talk again I was speechless."" Ridley continues, talking about his synthesized voice, a mature male English accent which he refers to as a ""posh version of Robocop"" and demonstrates the limited alternatives he had to choose from including a woman's voice, American accents and a German translation. But just when things are proceeding smoothly, disaster strikes and technology kicks him in the seat of his pants. After an uncomfortable silence Ridley recovers with a little improvisation. ""Sorry Ladies and gentlemen, my iPad has just crashed. Where the **** is Steve Jobs when you need him?"" As the laughter continues he's up and running once more. ""I am not related to Steven Hawking in any way. However I do hate the way people take the *** out of the way he speaks. I can really synthesize with him! ""People have often asked me why I want to put myself in a position where everyone can look and stare at me. The truth is that it happens to me every day any way. At least this way there's a scheduled time and place for it."" He finishes his set with an account of his audition for Simon Cowell's ""X-Factor"" with a dead-pan spoken-word version of ""I believe I can fly"" leaving the producers unsure how to handle him. With that he thanks his audience and lurches off the stage with loud cheers ringing in his ears. Just as Ridley thinks the night cannot get any better he bumps into one of his heroes -- not a comedian but the manager of his favorite football team, Newcastle United. Manager Alan Pardew is warm in his admiration. ""Let's be honest -- it takes incredible bravery to do what he's doing. More bravery than me or any of my players show to do what he's trying to do. So all I can say is that I wish him all the best in a very tough business. Our business is tough but his is tougher so I wish him all the best."" I suggest to Ridley that his act creates a dilemma for audiences: in normal circumstances it would be offensive for people to laugh at someone's disability but Lost Voice Guy invites his audience to laugh along with him at his own disability . Ridley begins typing and about a minute later his machine gives voice to his thoughts. ""I've also thought that any subject can be joked about if handled correctly. I think I can get away with more because it's essentially about me. I'd like to think the audience go away with a more positive view about disability."" The bookings have begun to roll in -- Ridley has been hired to perform at the prestigious Edinburgh Festival Fringe, attended by many a talent booker in search of the next comedy breakthrough act.","Born with cerebral palsy, Lee Ridley has been unable to speak since birth .

"(CNN) -- It would take you almost five solid months -- without sleeping or bathroom breaks -- to watch every sporting event at this year's Summer Olympics. More than 3,500 hours of competition from London will be crammed into just 17 days. In the past, people had to settle for watching the delayed, edited bits broadcast on TV or websites, but technology and viewing habits have changed. This year, 40% of people plan to follow the games on more than one device, with 35% checking in on their tablets and 27% using their smartphone, according to a new study by Harris Interactive. Fans asked to tweet from Olympics only if it's 'urgent' So what are the best ways for today's mobile, multiple-screen owning, Twitter-loving generation to follow the Olympics Ã  la carte? We offer these five: . Live streaming, with a catch . First, the good news: It's finally possible to stream any Olympic event live online, on a tablet or from your smartphone. After years of tape-delayed broadcasts and online video, NBC has caught on that viewers want to follow the Olympics on multiple devices in real time, and is offering the live options in addition to its regular television programming. The bad news is that anyone in the U.S. who wants to enjoy live streaming of the games needs to have a current cable, satellite or telco TV subscription that includes MSNBC and CNBC (for some areas this may mean be more than just basic cable). You will be prompted on the NBC site and in NBC apps to choose your provider from a list and log in with your official username and password in order to access any live streams. Cord cutters -- those who have canceled their cable and primarily watch TV online through services like Hulu and Netflix -- are out of luck, however. They can sign up for cable and cancel after the games are over, but there's no one-time payment option just to access live streaming. NBC wants mobile and online options to complement the TV coverage, not replace it. NBC, which is owned by the largest cable provider in the United States, Comcast, paid $1.18 billion for the rights to this year's Olympics. The network makes a good portion of that amount back on television advertising, which still generates more revenue than online ads. Online . The Internet portal for all video in the U.S. is NBCOlympics.com. On the main video page, anyone can view the select clips that NBC posts after watching a short ad. These clips are a combination of highlights from events, interviews, profiles, and peeks behind the scenes. Sort by your sport of choice or type of video. How to avoid Olympics spoilers . The site is also providing live streams of any sport to cable, satellite or telco TV subscribers. Called LiveExtra, the service will live stream some Olympic trials and every single Olympic sport. You can watch online or through the complimentary app. It's the only option for live streaming in the U.S. Though hosted through YouTube, all of the videos on the NBCOlympics are in Flash. To view them on iPhones, iPads or other mobile devices, go to the mobile version of the site, m.nbcolympics.com. You can also download one of the official apps to watch official NBC Olympic video on your iOS or Android device. For the first time, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will live stream 11 high-definition channels simultaneously over YouTube for 64 territories in Asia and Africa that don't have broadcast deals, but those streams will not be accessible outside of those countries. Foreign news websites such as the BBC will also have videos, but again, most will be blocked for U.S. viewers. Mobile apps . NBC created two official apps for Android and Apple mobile devices, NBC Olympics and NBC Olympics Live Extra, and both are free to download. NBC Olympics has no live video, but tons of content that can be enjoyed by anyone for free, including news, results, video highlights, and the intriguing-sounding Twitter heat map. NBC Olympics Live Extra app is a mobile version of its LiveExtra online service and requires a cable, satellite or telco subscription. View any event live, watch replays of the ones you missed, and check out medal ceremonies and alternative camera views. Look over the in-app schedule and set up notifications for the events you don't want to miss. (Avid streamers should be careful not to go over their monthly data limits.) There are two official apps for the London 2012 Olympics, and they're available for a mix of platforms including iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7. Official London 2012: Results App has live updates of results, as well as schedules, news, background on sports and athlete profiles. You can follow specific countries and set up custom alerts. The second app, Official London 2012: Join In App, is more for people attending the games, and has schedules and locations for the various Olympic-related festivities going on in London. The free BBC Olympic iOS and Android app will have a steady stream of quality Olympics news, including a running tally of medals won and live reporting from the BBC journalists attending events. Social media and news . Perhaps you have no interest in seeing your favorite diver's perfectly executed reverse 3 1/2 somersault tuck. You just want to know who got the gold as soon as it happens. Individual sports have official, automated Twitter feeds that will tweet out the results as they happen. You can narrow it down to just the events you're interested in and follow those feeds (say @L2012Trampoline or @L2012Judo), or keep an eye on all of them at once by following the London 2012 official Twitter list of automated feeds. The official London 2012 feed is @London2012. Twitter takes the Olympic gold for speed . This year a lot of the fun will be following the athletes themselves. You can look up your favorites or follow this list of verified Olympic athlete Twitter accounts, the London 2012 list of Olympians or find a list just for your preferred sport of team, like Team USA. If you want more color, find a hashtag for the event you're interested in to get live tweets of the excitement as it happens from attendees and journalists. There's also an official London 2012 Facebook page you can like to get updates. And of course, there are old-fashioned news sites and blogs filled with words and pictures. There are 21,000 journalists in London covering the Olympics (outnumbering the 10,500 athletes competing). With all the content online, on TV and on social media, keeping up with the Olympics won't be nearly as much of a challenge as avoiding spoilers. Television . Oh right, there's TV, too. If you have cable, you can catch NBC's coverage scattered across a number of its channels: NBC, NBC Sports Network, MSNBC, CNBC, Bravo and Telemundo. Check the schedule for your location, sorted by time or sport, at the NBC Olympics site. If you don't have cable, you can still tune into NBC over the air for nearly round-the-clock coverage, including the four-hour prime-time broadcast that will show the most popular events mixed in with the usual profiles and athlete interviews. The channel will broadcast a total of 217 hours of Olympic coverage. Opinion: Is it really #NBCfail?","This is the first year the Olympic games will be available as live streams in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration's Making Home Affordable program was designed to help homeowners like Mark Kollar and Angela Baca-Kollar keep their homes. Mark Kollar and Angela Baca-Kollar took part in the Making Home Affordable program. When the recession hit, the Arizona couple's income plummeted. They tried everything they could think of to hold on to their house: They drained their savings account, sold their 401(k), changed jobs. It wasn't enough, and foreclosure is set to begin in a week. The Kollars thought they had one last hope: the Making Home Affordable program, which should have reduced their monthly mortgage to affordable payments. In theory, it'd be a win-win: The Kollars and their two children keep their home, and the nation avoids one more foreclosure. The problem? The bank hasn't been playing along, and the Kollars have no place to turn. ""I don't want a handout. I want to do the right thing,"" Mark Kollar said. ""I thought this was supposed to give us a chance."" A CNN investigation revealed that the Kollars are far from alone. Housing counselors, homeowners and consumer advocates tell endless stories of banks giving homeowners the runaround: declining apparently eligible applicants; pressuring them into loans they can't afford; placing homes in foreclosure while the owners are being considered for a modified loan; lenders telling homeowners to waive their legal rights, even though the program prohibits it; or banks telling homeowners that they have to be in default to qualify, which isn't true.  Watch more about how the program has worked so far » . According to the Treasury Department's most recent report, only 230,000 of the up to 4 million eligible homeowners have new mortgages under the program. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has told bankers that he's not happy with the pace. Banks say that it took 90 days to get the program's rules and procedures and that they're still training staff members to handle it. The most common complaint from those applying for help: banks losing paperwork or dropping calls while the foreclosure clock is ticking.  Watch more on home mortgage problems » . Mark Kollar can testify to that. Since receiving his Making Home Affordable offer, he's spent hours trying to reach someone at his bank who can help. A number of representatives told him that this is his only offer; accept it or lose his house. After insisting on speaking to a supervisor, he was eventually told to resubmit the documentation he'd been submitting for months. In return for billions of dollars from the government to help banks recover from bad loans, the banks are supposed to help homeowners make their mortgage payments more affordable. As President Obama said unveiling the program in March, helping ""responsible folks who have been making their payments"" because it will ""leave money in their pockets and leave them more secure in their homes."" Under the Making Home Affordable formula, the Kollars' payment should have been reduced to 31 percent of their $3,000-a-month income. The bank's offer? A payment of $2,892 a month, or 96 percent of their income. Diane Thompson of the National Consumer Law Center says this isn't uncommon. ""We've seen gross errors of banks putting in wrong income to get ... payments,"" she said. Bank of America, which holds the Kollars' loan, says the offer it made was based on incorrect information from a government-approved housing counselor. Bank of America spokesman Rick Simon said it's difficult to determine what the Kollars should pay because Mark Kollar recently started a commission-based job, and his monthly income fluctuates. The bank plans to watch his earnings for a few more months before it moves ahead ""with consideration of a trial modification offer."" Simon said the bank is offering the Kollars a temporary new mortgage payment while it watches their earnings. ""Bank of America is committed to the success of the Making Home Affordable program and helping homeowners avoid foreclosure whenever a borrower has the ability to make a reasonable mortgage payment,"" Simon said. By one measure, the Kollars are more fortunate than others in the same predicament; the bank hasn't sold their house out from under them. Beth Goodell, a lawyer with the nonprofit Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, says she's seen that happen. ""Its outrageous,"" said Goodell, who represents low-income families in foreclosure. ""It has to be clearer that foreclosure should stop altogether while people are being considered."" She says the only outlet for these homeowners is the courts. An official with the Treasury Department said that ""in all identified instances where loans have been denied to eligible borrowers, the administration has worked with servicers to correct the problem and provide modifications."" And Michael Barr, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial institutions, says the program is ""off to a strong start."" He admits that ""servicer performance has been uneven"" but believes that the lenders are on track to make improvements. And he vows that the administration ""will hold these institutions accountable for their progress."" But Goodell has seen plenty go wrong, and she said, ""There's not adequate recourse."" Frustrated with the bank, Angela Baca-Kollar called the Obama administration's helpline, 1-888-995-HOPE, but the representative told her that the hot line ""can't strong-arm the bank"" and urged her to call a government-approved housing counselor. The Kollars had been working with such a counselor for months. ""There is nowhere to go,"" Angela Baca-Kollar said.","CNN told numerous stories of banks giving homeowners the runaround .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised India's efforts to reduce carbon emissions Sunday, but India's environment minister said the country won't agree to ""legally binding"" limits on greenhouse gases. Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh stands with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Sunday in Gurgaon. Clinton toured the ITC Green Center in Gurgaon, outside the Indian capital, with Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh, and she praised India's efforts to boost cleaner energy. She called the center a ""monument to the future"" and said the United States and India can work together to reduce industrial emissions blamed for an increase in global temperatures. ""The United States and India can devise a plan that will dramatically change the way we produce, consume and conserve energy, and in the process spark an explosion of new investment and millions of jobs,"" Clinton said. India's economy is growing at about 8 percent per year, a boom that has lifted a growing slice of its roughly 1 billion people out of poverty, and the nation has objected to calls for strict limits on carbon emissions. India was among the emerging economies that agreed earlier this month to work toward limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and Ramesh took issue with suggestions that his government was ""running away"" from that commitment. However, he added, ""We are simply not in a position to take on legally binding emissions reduction targets."" India is not ""oblivious to our responsibility,"" and is already working on reducing its carbon emissions, Ramesh said. He agreed with Clinton that Washington and New Delhi can come together on steps to reduce greenhouse gases. Clinton said the United States won't do anything to limit India's economic progress, but ""we believe there is a way to eradicate poverty while still lowering the carbon footprint."" The Group of Eight industrial powers -- the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia and Japan -- agreed to a target of reducing their carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050. But efforts to reduce greenhouse gases are a sticking point with developing economies like India and China, where living standards have increased rapidly over the past 20 years. Clinton is on a weeklong trip to India and Thailand.","India's environment minister: We can't take legally binding emission reductions .

"(CNN) -- Recently, a reader dropped the following query into our inbox: . ""This may be a stupid question, but recently a friend told me he's heard of people using Facebook as a dating service. My FB friends and I (admittedly middle-aged) can't figure out how you ""meet"" people on Facebook. I (and most of my friends) are FB friends with people we actually know. How would one use Facebook as a dating site?"" - Flummoxed by Facebook Flirting . Oh, Flummoxed! There are no stupid questions -- only painfully, painfully stupid people. But I digress.... . Social media flirting is a phenom that has been around since the message board/chatroom days, when starry-eyed 13-year-olds and rheumy-eyed 61-year-olds traded ""A/S/L?""s with optimistic abandon. A quick survey of my social followers -- on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Instagram -- revealed that, among my socially savvy circle of folks, people have dated/married suitors they met on MySpace, Facebook, Tumblr, Foursquare, MyYearBook, Yahoo Messenger and Usenet, to name a few. In fact, this past week, the story of how one couple met on Words With Friends swept the blogosphere: Megan Lawless and Jasper Jasperse started playing the smartphone-based word game and were pitted against each other randomly. After talking via the game's ""Chat"" feature and later communicating on Skype and e-mail, the pair met in person, and, eventually married -- Jasperse moving from his native Netherlands to Chicago to be with his bride. While all of this may seem weird/creepy/slightly sad to anyone who didn't grow up a digital native, consider this: Americans now spend about a quarter of their online time using social networks. If you're giving your monitor the old glassy eyeball instead of tipping back highballs at your local TV-plastered sports bar, that's likely where you're going to make connections. However, the actual process of meeting people via social media is still rather, well, creepy. (Less creepy than back in the days of message boards and AOL chatrooms, but creepy all the same.) Assuming that you are not, in fact, a weirdo who collects spleens (we give you guys so much leeway on this factor), here are some tips on how to make any social media site a dating site without being a creep. Don't: . Compliment incessantly: You know that dude who staggers up to you at the bar, breathes whiskey into your face and murmurs, ""Hey lady, you got mad cleavage, yo."" He's creepy, right? He's even kind of creepy when he goes a less aggressive route and compliments something benign, like your eyes (""You have lovely orbs... May I have them?""). Why? Because he's stating his intentions off the bat, and our society -- addled by years and years of romantic comedy-viewage -- prefers a bit of a chase. When engaging with people via social media, talking about their appearance/demeanor/eyeballs is even more unsettling than at the bar, because you don't know the person in question and you can't see their face in the flesh. Instead of going directly for flattery, start up a conversation with the object of your desire, thereby charming them with your wit and whimsy rather than empty poesy (or straight-up sexual harassment). Come to think of it, that's probably good advice for comporting yourself at ye olde sports bar as well. Repeat yourself: If your hoped-for intended doesn't reply to the first five tweets you send him about your shared love of fossils and tesseracts, cease and desist with your wooing. He doesn't like you. Here's a tissue. Erase your face: No one wants to date a picture of a donut. When choosing your avatar, make sure to show your face, or, at the very least, link to a website featuring a picture of your mug. If you're sensitive about your big-ass nose or your shiny head, just chill out. Ugly people get married, too -- I see their progeny on the subway daily. Exhibit your courtship: Some initial public bantering is fine -- via Twitter, Facebook Walls, etc -- but if you carry on your heavy flirting (""OMG! I love the shape of your broken nose! You look like a matador!"") in a public forum, you risk annoying your friends and followers or, worse, embarrassing your potential date -- especially if you ask out said potential date publicly. Have we learned nothing from that dude who asked that girl to marry him on the JumboTron? Twitter allows you to DM people, Facebook boasts private messages and even Tumblr has an internal messaging service called Fan Mail now -- there's no excuse for blithely PDA'ing the hell out of your swain. Play phantom: We're assuming that you actually want to meet the object of your late-night Google stalking, so when it comes to digital flirting -- bring it offline ASAP. We're also assuming that said person wants to meet you (we're trusting you again here, guys -- hopefully you possess the social skills to recognize interest, unlike that aforementioned dude in the sports bar). So why not ask them to hang in person? Or, better yet, in the presence of tons and tons of friends who can waylay a possible kidnapping/murder scenario.","People meet and date on MySpace, Facebook, Tumblr, Foursquare and other sites .

"(CNN) -- ""The war on drugs has failed"" is a mantra often heard in policy and media circles these days. But not only is the phrase outdated (the 1980s called -- they want their slogan back), it is far too simplistic to describe both current drug policy and its outcomes. The latest incarnation of this ill-advised saying can be found in a report arguing that since cannabis and heroin prices have fallen while their purity has increased, efforts to curb drug use and its supply are doomed to failure. This leads some to highlight the possibility of alternatives in the form of ""regulation"" (e.g., legalization) of drugs. But a closer look at the data -- and the implications for a policy change to legalization -- should give us pause if we care about the dire consequences drug addiction has on society. Globally, drug use has been stable over the past decade, though it is difficult to paint such a broad brush across countries and substances. But in the U.S. alone, there has been a 40% drop in cocaine use since 2006 and a 68% decrease in workplace positive cocaine tests. Overall in the U.S., all drug use has fallen by about 30% since 1979. There are likely numerous reasons for this drop, but we can't ignore the fact that the world's top supplier of the drug -- Colombia -- has greatly improved its security situation over the same period. With help from the United States, Colombia has managed to reduce the amount of land dedicated to coca growing by nearly two-thirds from 2000 to 2010. Potential production of cocaine has also fallen more than 60%, though in places without such security enhancements -- namely Bolivia and Peru -- cocaine production has picked up. Still, this shows that progress is not only possible, it is happening. As for the opiates and cannabis, trends vary widely in different regions around the world. While critics are right to say that prices have fallen while potency has risen generally, globally the picture is much more mixed (the global cultivation of poppy has actually fallen since 1997 worldwide). In policy analysis, the key question that must follow any sentence that says ""X policy is good/bad"" is: ""Compared to what?"" Some have offered legalization as a possible alternative. But we know from our experience with currently legal drugs -- prescription drugs (which are now the leading cause of accidental deaths in the U.S.), alcohol and tobacco -- that legality means commercialization, normalization and wider access and availability that lead to more use and addiction. Legalization in the United States is likely to accompany a bombardment of promotion, similar to our other three classes of legal drugs. These industries will stop at nothing to increase addiction since their bottom line relies on it. In fact, we know that 80% of the profit from addictive industries comes from the 20% of users who consume most of the volume of the substance. According to internal documents that the government forced Big Tobacco to release during its historic court settlement, those companies are ready to pounce on the golden opportunity of drug legalization. It is no wonder that the parent company of Phillip Morris, Altria, recently bought the domain names ""AltriaCannabis.com"" and ""AltriaMarijuana.com."" If this sounds frightening, it should be. Big Tobacco tried for decades to conceal the harms of their drug, and millions of lives were lost as a result. We are naive to think that this wouldn't happen with any other drug that is legalized. Where does that leave us? That legalization is not a solution does not mean we have to be content with the status quo. Proven interventions such as community-based drug prevention efforts, drug treatment courts, offender re-entry programs and probation reform should be more robustly implemented and taken to scale. It is shameful that the richest country in the world can't figure out a way to make drug treatment available to all who need it, and we must stop relying on incarceration to deal with the drug problem. Interestingly, though, according to criminologist Mark Kleiman, if all drug prisoners were released tomorrow, we would still have four times the number of people in prison than our historical incarceration rate instead of five. That tells me that the root causes of drug use, trafficking and crime, must be seriously tackled. On the other hand, legalization -- especially in ad-obsessed America -- would not only sweep the causes of drug use under the rug, it would open the floodgates to more addiction, suffering and costs than we could ever bargain for. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Sabet.","A report says cheaper, purer illegal substances suggest war on drugs is failing .

"(CNN) -- Once again, the eyes of the nation are upon Texas. When it comes to political news and the occasional shenanigan, our second most populous state always seems to come in first. The latest dust-up in the Lone Star State is about women's reproductive rights. The Democratic minority last week stopped a bill being pushed by the Republican majority that would have shut down most of the state's abortion clinics and banned abortion in the state after 20 weeks. But the ruckus is also about saying the wrong thing in the wrong way, and coming off like a jerk in the process. It's about etiquette and character, and how intensely unlikable a politician can become when he is running low on both. Likability counts for a lot in politics. Voters often make choices about which candidate to support based on whether we can relate to them or feel comfortable around them. Meanwhile, a lot of Americans feel uncomfortable about late-term abortion. It's a barbaric procedure that opponents consider infanticide. It's also where many people like me, who are pro-choice, draw the line. The Democrats' victory in the legislature is credited to Sen. Wendy Davis, who staged an 11-hour filibuster to push the debate past the stroke of midnight and the end of a special session. The victory was short-lived. Gov. Rick Perry called a second special session to allow Republican legislators more time to get the legislation passed and onto his desk, where he is eager to sign it. This high-stakes game of Texas Hold 'em could well be a preview of the 2014 matchup for the state's top job. At one end of the table sits Davis. A rising star in the Democratic Party who represents Fort Worth, she has long been thought to be interested in running for governor. Now, thanks to Republican attempts to shut her down, she has an issue. The campaign ad writes itself: ""Davis bravely stood up to the Republican majority, and backed them down."" At the other end, you'll find Perry. I wrote for the Dallas Morning News for five years. And I know this much: The governor has always been a paradox. One on one, he's very effective. He's charming and personable, and easy to relate to. But when he steps into his public persona, as in debates or at press conferences, he becomes less likable. Out goes the class president, and in comes the schoolyard bully. It was the latter that showed up when Perry addressed the National Right to Life conference in Grapevine, Texas, near Dallas, a few days after Davis' filibuster. Obviously still smarting from the setback, Perry fired off these condescending remarks: . ""Who are we to say that children born in the worst of circumstances can't grow to live successful lives? In fact, even the woman who filibustered the Senate the other day was born into difficult circumstances. She was the daughter of a single woman. She was a teenage mother herself. She managed to eventually graduate from Harvard Law School and serve in the Texas Senate. It is just unfortunate that she hasn't learned from her own example that every life must be given a chance to realize its full potential and that every life matters."" Katy, bar the door. Perry's comments were rude, presumptuous and highly inappropriate. There are plenty of ways to disagree with a political opponent and make a point without getting personal and dredging up details of her personal life -- and in this case, her mother's personal life. Perry as much as suggested that Davis should be more sympathetic to unborn babies because, given her life's circumstance, her mother might have had an abortion and Davis wouldn't be here. During an appearance on CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" Davis was asked to respond. Here's what she said: . ""Well, what went through my mind was that that was a terribly personal thing to say. And, of course, I've been in the political arena for some time. It takes a lot to offend me. But what I was offended about was the statement that it makes on behalf of women throughout the state of Texas. I think it showed disregard for the fact that we all, we each, own our own personal history. We make choices and -- and have the opportunity to take chances that present themselves to us. What this is about is making sure that women across the state of Texas have the same opportunity to make those choices and have the same chances that I had."" Davis got it right. In the abortion debate, women have long insisted that they have the right to control their bodies. Now do they have to take the next step and assert control over their life stories? It looks like, in Texas, the answer is yes. Women do need to reassert control over their life stories. Otherwise, others -- including elected officials -- will try to take over those narratives to serve their own purposes. That's what Perry did to Davis, and it reflected badly on him. He won't apologize. But he should. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: The latest dust-up in Texas is about women's reproductive rights .

"(CNN) -- As thousands of Democrats converge on Denver for the party's 45th convention, history will be made by officially nominating Sen. Barack Obama, the first African-American presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party. A worker prepares the stage for the Democratic convention in Denver, which also hosted the Democrats in 1908. But what about all the other history and trivia at the Democratic convention? Check out these tidbits of convention history and political trivia. The convention . The 2008 Democratic National Convention is being held later in the year than any previous convention for either party not already holding the White House. Obama's acceptance speech on Thursday at this year's convention falls on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech. The first Democratic convention was held in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1832 at which President Andrew Jackson was nominated for a second term. Since 1996, the Democrats have scheduled the vice president nominee's acceptance speech on Wednesday night instead of Thursday, when the presidential nominee speaks. This Wednesday, the convention will conduct a roll call vote to officially select Obama as the presidential nominee. Democrats have held a state-by-state roll call vote at every convention since 1964 when Lyndon Johnson was approved by acclamation. The last time a Democratic presidential roll call went more than one ballot was in 1952. Adlai Stevenson was selected on the third ballot. This year, Hillary Clinton's name will be placed in nomination Wednesday in a nod to her historic campaign. She is the first woman ever to win more than one presidential primary. She won 23 contests. The Democratic convention in New York in 1924 was the longest in history -- 17 days.  Watch the best and worst of conventions » . The Democratic convention in Baltimore in 1872 was the shortest in history -- six hours. The location . The first three days of the convention will be held at the Pepsi Center which is home to the NBA's Denver Nuggets and seats about 20,000 people. Obama will give his acceptance speech on Thursday at Invesco Field which is home to the Denver Broncos and seats about 76,000 people. John F. Kennedy was the last presidential nominee to give an acceptance speech outdoors when he spoke at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1960. Denver has hosted one other party convention, also Democratic, in 1908. It was the first convention held by a major party in a Western state. Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan who eventually lost the election to the Republican nominee, William Howard Taft. The candidates, past and present . If Obama is elected, he will be the third president from Illinois, following Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant. Sen. Joe Biden will be the first Delawarean to serve on a major party's national ticket. And how often has a presidential candidate turned to someone he ran against for his running mate? Since 1900, the Democrats have done it seven times; the GOP, eight times. In 1932, Franklin Roosevelt became the first presidential nominee to deliver an acceptance speech in person at a convention. Frederick Douglass was the first African-American to receive a vote for president at a major party's convention. Douglass received one vote at the 1888 GOP convention. Washington minister Channing Phillips was the first African-American to receive a vote for president at a Democratic convention. Phillips received 67.5 votes at the Democrats' 1968 convention. In 1896, 36-year-old Democrat William Jennings Bryan became the youngest person to win a major party's presidential nomination. The delegates . More than 4,000 delegates will attend the Democratic convention. An estimated 15,000 members of the media will also be on hand. The oldest delegate at this year's Democratic convention is 91-year-old Sophie Masloff of Pennsylvania. The youngest is 17-year-old David Gilbert Pederson from Minnesota. Slightly more than half of this year's Democratic convention delegates are women: 50.1 percent. Almost half of the delegates at this year's Democratic convention --­ 44.3 percent -­- represent minority communities. African-Americans make up almost 24.5 percent of this year's delegation, the largest share in Democratic convention history. The first African-American delegates to a Democratic national convention were seated in 1936. The first African-American delegates to a Republican national convention were seated in 1868. The first woman delegate to a Democratic national convention was seated in 1908. She was from Colorado. The first woman delegate to a Republican national convention was seated in 1900. She was from Utah. Robert Yoon and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","The longest Democratic convention was 17 days; the shortest -- six hours .

"(CNN) -- It was a year of crippling -- and creative -- hacks, a year of blockbuster sequels and (yet again) a year of slinging vengeful birds at corpulent pigs. It was also a year in which gaming continued to expand beyond the traditional console to your phone, your tablet, your TV and your Facebook page. Video gaming in 2011 had plenty of ups and downs -- and we're not even talking about the actual video game titles that were released. Here, in no particular order, are our choices for gaming's 10 biggest stories of the year: . Sony's PlayStation Network hacked . While the explosion of social and mobile gaming continues, a hacking incident focused attention on the perils of gaming online. In April, Sony confirmed that its PlayStation Network, the online service that has more than 77 million users and allows online play for its PS3 consoles, was hacked and taken offline. The episode was more than just a denial-of-service attack. Sony said that personal data, including users' credit card information, was compromised. While Sony stopped short of saying ""stolen,"" the company recommended that its customers keep an eye on their credit card accounts and watch out for identity theft. Some gamers lacked access for weeks, and the network was not fully restored until early June. After the fix, Sony offered special incentives to woo back customers. But in October, the PlayStation Network was hacked again -- this time affecting ""only"" 93,000 accounts. Sony said the lessons they learned from the April hack prevented more information from being illegally accessed. A teenager in London was quickly arrested in connection with the crime. Game-related hacking in 2011 wasn't just a PlayStation problem. Earlier in the year, the hacker group LulzSec released a data file with names, e-mail addresses and passwords they said could be used to get into the accounts of Microsoft's Xbox Live members. The growth of mobile and social gaming . Game developers increasingly recognize they can reach new audiences with games that are designed to be played quickly and with others via PCs or wireless networks. Zynga, the social-game developer behind ""CityVille,"" ""FarmVille"" and ""Words With Friends,"" went public in 2011 and began trading on NASDAQ. Its stock has fizzled so far, but that hasn't stopped rivals from muscling into the market for social and mobile gaming. Companies are developing more games for smartphones and tablets and incorporating social features to let players around the world connect to enjoy games together. Atari changed its mission to work exclusively on social and mobile gaming, while publishers like Electronic Arts continue to push big names (the ""Madden"" series) to the small screen. Meanwhile Google launched a gaming page on its new Google Plus social network, and Apple added a ""Game Center"" to its popular iPhone. Blockbuster game sales . You know gaming is big when the release of a title smashes entertainment records for sales. For the third consecutive year, the ""Call of Duty"" franchise raised the bar. ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" earned more than $400 million while selling more than 6.5 million units in North America and the United Kingdom in the first 24 hours. If that wasn't enough, the military shooter game totaled more than $775 million in sales during the first five days. ""Modern Warfare 3"" also broke the record for peak concurrent players on Microsoft's Xbox Live online gaming service. According to Activision Blizzard, the all-time sales for the ""Call of Duty"" franchise exceeds worldwide box office sales for the ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. There were more than 13,000 midnight openings at retail stores worldwide for the release of the new title. Last year, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" sold $360 million worth of units on its first day while ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2"" earned $310 million on its first day in 2009. More than a gaming device . Microsoft introduced its Kinect system for the Xbox in 2010 to expand motion-controlled gaming beyond the wrist to the whole body. In 2011, creative people found new ways to hack the device, employing its cameras and sensors for more than just play. Some people have used the Kinect to create lifelike movies with computer-generated figures. Others use it to manipulate video playback. And other hackers even found ways to use Kinect as a watchdog for your home. A program turns on Kinect when it senses motion nearby and takes pictures of the ""intruders"" -- whether a burglar or the family dog -- to be stored online. 3-D games in your hand . With much fanfare, Nintendo released a new handheld console in early 2011 that lets players experience 3-D visuals without the use of special glasses. The Nintendo 3DS was supposed to revolutionize the gaming experience. But by August, Nintendo dropped the price on the device by $80 after demand for it was softer than expected. To appease early adopters who bought the 3DS at the higher price, Nintendo offered 20 free downloadable games. The device also suffered from a perception problem about health risks. The company warned the 3-D mode should not be used by players 6 years old and younger. While there has been no scientific data showing that 3-D harms the development of eyesight in children, some players did report experiencing headaches after hours of continuous playing. ""Angry Birds"" takes on the world . Casual game ""Angry Birds,"" already a hit in 2010, became a full-fledged phenomenon in 2011. The game, in which people advance to new levels by toppling structures occupied by egg-stealing pigs, appeared in commercials and as stuffed toys. Also in the works are an animated series, a possible feature film and a series of books, including a cookbook of egg recipes. Notable fans include NBA star Kevin Durant and British Prime Minister David Cameron, who plays the iPad version of the game. ""Angry Birds"" has even inspired a form of yoga. Game creator Rovio says players have slingshot more than 100 billion virtual birds in the game's many versions -- more birds than actually exist on the planet. New hardware coming . This year, two major gaming hardware companies announced new gaming consoles. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, Sony showed off its new handheld game console, the PlayStation Vita, while Nintendo introduced its newest home console, the Wii U. The first major refresh for the Wii in several years, the Wii U is expected to be fully backwards compatible with the Wii. The controller will have an embedded single-touch screen, and the console will produce high-definition graphics. No price has been announced for the console, which will be released after March 2012. The PlayStation Vita, Sony's new handheld console and the successor to the PSP, was released in Japan in December and is expected to North America and the UK in February. It boasts touch screens on the front and back as well as dual analog joysticks. Vita will also be available in two versions: one with 3G support and one without. A more affordable PS3 . Perhaps feeling the heat over the PSN hacking problems, Sony cut the price of its flagship console, the PlayStation 3. The price drop of about $50 put the cost on par with the rival Xbox 360. Some analysts wondered whether Microsoft would respond with an Xbox price drop of its own, but that never happened. Buoyed by Xbox-exclusive hits like ""Gears of War 3,"" the Microsoft system remained the top-selling gaming console in the U.S. Moving from subscription to free-to-play . ""World of Warcraft"" has been the most successful subscription-based entry in the awkwardly named category of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG), with 10.3 million subscribers as of November. So it stands to reason that others would try to take a slice of that very large pie. Perhaps the most notable was ""DC Universe Online,"" which was released in January and tried to capitalize on the power of DC Comics. The game let players act out their comic hero/villain fantasies in the DC Universe and interact with iconic characters like Superman, Joker and Wonder Woman. Initially, players paid a monthly fee (around $15 in the U.S.), but by September, there were reports that the game was not doing as well as Sony, Warner Bros., and DC Comics would have liked. In November, the game became free, but it offered players the option of paying within the game to access new levels. The strategy worked, as ""DC Universe Online"" saw a tenfold increase in its user base. The season of '3' Finally, you can't talk about the year in gaming without talking about games. As always, many of the popular franchises produced sequels, with many of the blockbuster shooter titles sporting the number 3 in their titles. ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,"" ""Battlefield 3"" and ""Gears of War 3"" all brought back familiar violent gameplay and characters while putting them in new scenarios. ""Uncharted 3,"" featuring the treasure-seeking ways of Nathan Drake, closed out that franchise. ""Resistance 3"" also brought an end to the alien invasion of Earth. And ""F.E.A.R 3"" finally stopped making us dread little girls in darkened hallways. X-Play host Morgan Webb said all these sequels and finale installments are happening for a reason: New consoles are coming in the near future. ""We're nearly at the end of a console cycle, so series that have begun at the beginning of the console cycle, they're starting to finish up,"" she said. ""People have made the investment in the franchise and they've got the art together and they don't want to create something completely new when new consoles are starting to be on the horizon.""","The top gaming stories of 2011 revolved around hacks, sequels, innovation .

"(CNN) -- The recently discovered Flame virus bears all the hallmarks of a cyberattack concocted by a nation-state. It's big and complex and pointed directly at a geopolitical hot zone, Iran. What really gives it away as a government project is the extent to which its programmers sought to keep it out of civilian hands. The malware seems no more designed to protect us from a nuclear Iran than it is safeguarded to keep us from using the program itself against one another. Flame is sophisticated. It's not a tiny piece of code that nests itself in e-mail and then erases your hard drive. It might better be described as a suite of programs -- the Microsoft Office of malware -- that perform different tasks. One turns on the microphone of a computer to record conversations; another sets up a virtual machine on the computer to be controlled remotely; another uses Bluetooth to connect to nearby cell phones and copy data or monitor phone calls. One compresses all this espionage into smaller files; yet another sends data back to the master computer, accepts commands and installs new updates. This level of complexity and breadth of functionality is unparalleled. But, in the theater of cyberwarfare, every successful cyberattack can be considered the most advanced attack of all time. This is an arms race of a new sort, where measures and countermeasures change the entire programming landscape. The methods of previous attacks, once analyzed, are neutralized by new additions and patches to computer operating systems. This sends would-be infiltrators back to the drawing board to come up with new, superior approaches. Technological warfare is a bit like evolution, where new mutations compete for survival. Only on computers, we don't have to wait for nature to spontaneously fold a chromosome in some new way. We have programmers actively looking for new windows of opportunity, new maneuvers, new countermeasures and new ways of hiding what they're doing. It amounts to the weaponization of cyberspace -- a practice in which the U.S. government has apparently been participating, sometimes reluctantly, according to an article in The New York Times last week. The cybercampaign against Iran apparently began under the Bush administration working with Israel, and continued under Barack Obama, who voiced concern about the precedent America was setting. The resulting Stuxnet virus, aimed at disabling Iran's nuclear refineries, ended up getting loose on the Internet in the summer of 2010. The revelation of U.S. involvement with the virus worried Obama, according to the Times article, as it could justify future cyberattacks on Americans by enemies of the United States. Flame may or may not be another product of this same campaign. When asked about his nation's complicity in the malware, Israeli Vice Prime Minister Moshe Ya'alon cheekily told Army Radio, ""Israel is blessed with high technology."" But the rest of us are blessed with high technology, too. What's to keep malware such as Flame from being used against civilian populations or even by civilian populations? Nations have been using computers for warfare since computers existed. The development of the modern computer was in no small part accelerated by World War II. America's ENIAC computer calculated artillery trajectories, while Britain's Colossus computer decoded the Nazi's encrypted messages. At the time, however, computers were not household appliances. Like cannons and other weapons of war, they were tools of the state and inaccessible to regular folks. And while the current cyberwar may be a nation vs. nation affair, the kinds of technologies unleashed in this conflict are not beyond the technical capability of more rogue hackers and criminals. The same technologies that let the U.S. and Israel thwart Iran's nuclear program can also enable, say, an Eastern European crime syndicate to participate in your banking activity. What makes Flame unique -- and almost certainly of government origin -- is that it appears to have been written in a way that not only slows detection and countermeasures, but that also slows the spread of its techniques. The complete suite of programs is over 20 megabytes. And while at first glance this seems to be a downside -- an elephant hiding in plain sight -- it has actually served to keep it unnoticed for at least two years. More importantly, it was made huge on purpose. Much of its code is simply camouflage -- 3,000 lines of programming that make it hard to understand and even harder for an enemy team of coders or even hackers in the civilian population to copy and use themselves. It's as if its programmers were attempting to be responsible or at least exclusionary, and to prevent the weaponization of the greater Internet. Now that's classic government behavior. It's also probably futile. Such efforts will likely only slow this inevitable slide toward an Internet that feels as blocked by security checks as an international airport. For in truth, we are all blessed with high technology. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Flame virus attack on Iran has hallmarks of being concocted by nation-state .
He cites article saying Obama concerned that such an attack might someday be aimed at U.S.

"(CNN) -- This duck is named Buttercup. He was born with a backwards left foot. Buttercup lives in Arlington, Tennessee at the Feathered Angels Waterfowl Sanctuary, where owner Mike Garey decided not only to amputate Buttercup's foot (Garey says it would be too painful and prone to infections), but also to design a replacement foot as well. Garey used Buttercup's sister Minnie's left foot as the basis for the design of Buttercup's new foot, which he modeled using 3D software. Once the artificial mold was designed, Garey sent the design to a 3D-printing company called NovaCopy, who printed out and donated a three-dimensional mold of the foot. That mold was used to create and test various silicone feet for Buttercup to try out on his non-footed leg. As CNET reports, ""Buttercup, currently walking around on his stump, is due to get his new foot very soon, with the final design arriving in the next two weeks.","Duck born with backward foot getting replacement via 3-D printer .

"(CNN) -- Immigration is the only issue where a political candidate can totally do the bidding of the K Street lobbyists and still be hailed as compassionate and humane. At CNN's Republican National Security Debate this past Tuesday, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich reconfirmed his longstanding immigration policy: . -- A commitment to enhanced border security . -- A guest worker program . -- Individual hearings for each of 12 million or so illegal aliens, at which those with long ties to the country will gain residency rights . -- No citizenship for illegal entries . On its face, this program is unworkable. Examine each piece in turn: . Why the border? The border is the wrong place to stop illegal immigration, if only because tighter security wouldn't stop the up to 45% of the illegal population who enter the country legally, then overstay their visas, as estimated by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security. The right place to stop illegality is the workplace. If employers faced an effective requirement to hire only legal workers, and meaningful penalties for breaking the law, we'd change the incentive structure that creates the problem in the first place. As is, employers are punished only if they can be shown to have employed illegal labor ""knowingly,"" meaning that so long as the employee produces a valid-seeming Social Security number, the employer goes scot-free. Even if somehow caught, the fines are small. Under those circumstances, you could deploy the whole U.S. Army on the Mexican border and hardly make an impact on the problem. Immigration enforcement inescapably impinges on employers, especially employers in low-wage industries such as restaurants, hotels, groundskeeping and meatpacking, whose voices are heard through those K Street lobbyists. Border security is the policy you endorse if you don't want to impinge on employers. Which means that border security is the policy you endorse if you don't want your immigration enforcement to succeed. Why guest workers? The United States in 2011 does not exactly suffer from a labor shortage. The unemployment rates for the most recent immigrants are particularly bad: the Latino unemployment rate is almost 12%, the unemployment rate for people without a high school diploma is almost 14%. How can you imagine that the US needs an even larger population of low-skilled labor? When most Americans hear the phrase ""guest worker,"" they think ""agricultural labor."" But past guest worker proposals have not been so limited. Such proposals generally provide that when employers cannot attract labor of a specific type at a specific wage, they may import that labor from abroad, and not only from Mexico (a middle-income country by world standards), but from genuinely poor countries such as Indonesia, Egypt or Vietnam. The only requirement is that guest workers be paid above the U.S. minimum wage. Employers in difficult or dangerous industries such as nursing homes or garbage recycling can find Americans today who will do very hard work at very low wages. But such employees will not necessarily be grateful for the opportunity, and they will know that they can quit the job without forfeiting their right to remain in the country. Guest working is the policy you endorse if your labor market priority is a cheaper and more pliable work force. Why hearings? Gingrich had a good applause line about uprooting the illegal alien who has sunk 25-year roots in the country and has citizen children and grandchildren. But how do you tell the difference between that person and between the illegal alien who has been present for 20 years? Or two years? Or two months? Gingrich proposes individualized hearings by citizen courts. But 12 million hearings? Really? Even if we could somehow complete a hearing an hour, you are talking about 1.5 million person-days, or 5,769 person-years. And that's assuming the courts approved the concept, which they very well might not. The idea is unworkable on its face. It would rapidly disintegrate into something very like blanket approvals of whole categories of illegals -- in other words, into some kind of qualified amnesty. Hearings are the policy you endorse if your real goal is to find a way to represent amnesty as something other than amnesty. Why not citizenship? Gingrich proposes to confer on much of the 12 million illegal population the right to live and work in the United States, but not citizenship. That is, not the right to vote. At a stroke, the measure would create a huge class of subordinated workers in this country. But it would also do something else, something very politically ingenious. The newly legalized residents of the United States would no longer have reason to hide from the Census Bureau. They'd be enumerated just in time for 2020. Immigration magnet states such as Texas, Arizona and Florida would gain increased representation in Congress and greater clout in the Electoral College. But because those new residents would not be able to vote, the clout would be exercised only by the state's older citizen population, and it would be that way for years to come. (Of the top 10 illegal immigration states, only four are blue states: California, New York, Illinois and New Jersey.) Were illegal aliens to gain the franchise, they'd likely vote overwhelmingly Democratic. Even in the Republican year 2004, the Democrats swept voters with incomes of less than $15,000 by a 63% to 36% margin, and voters with family incomes of $15,000-$30,000 by a 57% to 42% margin. As noncitizens, the former illegals would not vote at all. Noncitizenship is the policy you advocate if you want to expand the low-wage work force while tamping down the number of low-wage Democratic voters. Is there a better way? There is, and it's the way advocated by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. 1: Enforce the immigration laws at the workplace, removing the magnet that draws new illegal workers and encouraging the existing illegal population to return home. Yes, that population includes people who have been present in the country for more than 20 years and won't return. It also includes people who have been in the country less than 20 months and might well return if they cannot find work in the U.S. 2: Pause to assess. See how much an enforcement-first policy reduces the illegal population. The best estimates suggest that the recession of 2008-2009 sent perhaps 1.7 million illegals back home. A prolonged period of enforcement -- and the removal of the offer of early amnesty -- would likely reduce the illegal population even more. 3: Debate and decide on any future amnesty proposal after enforcement has taken effect, not before. If any approach to immigration deserves to be described as ""humane,"" it is the approach that begins with concern for the stagnating wages of American workers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Newt Gingrich's plan doesn't solve immigration problem .
By emphasizing border security, it neglects role of employers as magnet, he says .
Holding individual hearings on 12 million illegal immigrants is unworkable, Frum says .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge signed off on BP's settlement with businesses and people hard hit by the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans issued a 125-page ruling Friday night on a class-action suit. He gave the settlement preliminary approval in May and overruled questions and criticism of the agreement in his Friday ruling. ""None of the objections, whether filed on the objections docket or elsewhere, have shown the settlement to be anything other than fair, reasonable, and adequate,"" the ruling said. ""The low numbers of objections and opt-outs are evidence of the settlement's fairness."" BP has estimated a settlement of about $7.8 billion paid from a $20 billion trust. Thousands of businesses and individuals made claims in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, some coastal counties in eastern Texas and western Florida and adjacent Gulf waters and bays. With the exception of seafood claims, there is no cap on the amount BP will pay to those who agree to the settlement. Feds won't do new business with BP . BP will pay $2.3 billion to commercial fishermen, seafood boat captains and crew, seafood vessel owners and oyster leaseholders. The money represents ""approximately five times the annual average industry gross revenue for 2007 to 2009 of the seafood industry in the region covered by the settlement agreement."" It also ""represents 19.2 times lost industry revenue in 2010,"" the ruling said. The ruling notes that ""the settlement program is processing claims in an ""impressive fashion."" By last month, 4,500 claims were processed per work. BP said it is pleased the court approved the settlement ""resolving the substantial majority of legitimate economic loss and property damage claims stemming from the Deepwater Horizon accident."" It called the decision ""another important step forward for BP in meeting its commitment to economic and environmental restoration efforts in the Gulf and in eliminating legal risk facing the company."" ""We believe the settlement, which avoids years of lengthy litigation, is good for the people, businesses and communities of the Gulf and is in the best interests of BP's stakeholders,"" it said in a statement. Dean Blanchard, a shrimp processor in Grand Isle, Louisiana, said he opted out of the agreement. He said he wouldn't have gotten a fair amount of money and is planning his own lawsuit. ""BP is trying to make a one size fits all,"" he said, saying some people and businesses were hit worse than others and deserve more money. ""It's not right."" Families of killed rig workers react to BP settlement . The oil spill -- one of the worst in U.S. history -- began after a rig explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf. Eleven workers died. Oil spewed into the sea for nearly three months before a cap was placed on the BP-owned Macondo well, nearly a mile beneath the surface. The spill damaged coral reef formations, according to researchers. Scientists have previously confirmed that a plume of hydrocarbons from the well settled in the deep Gulf. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said about 59,200 barrels of oil a day flowed from the well. Last month, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that BP will plead guilty to manslaughter charges stemming from the explosion and the spill. It agreed to pay $4.5 billion in government penalties. Of those penalties, $4 billion will resolve criminal charges. An additional $525 million will be paid to resolve claims brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that BP lied to investors by understating the amount of oil flowing into the Gulf. Separate from the corporate manslaughter charges, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging the two highest-ranking BP supervisors on board the Deepwater Horizon on the day of the explosion with 23 criminal counts. The two men were charged with seaman's manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter for each of the 11 men killed in the blast, as well as a criminal violation of the clean water act. The Justice Department in September also accused BP of gross negligence and a ""culture of corporate recklessness"" in a federal court filing, which expanded the company's liability. A major civil trial is set to take place in New Orleans in February. The spill: How much should BP suffer?","With the exception of seafood industry claims, there's no cap .
Settlement is fair and reasonable, despite objections, judge says .

"(CNN) -- On August 24, a jury of nine in a California federal court handed down a ruling that sent shockwaves through the global wireless phone industry. Samsung, the world's largest phone maker, was found guilty of infringing on key Apple hardware design and software elements. Samsung got Apple's attention because of its size, but every Android device manufacturer now needs to consider potential exposure areas that could put them in the crosshairs as Apple tries to slow Android growth. The appeals game will surely play out over the next many months. In the meantime, consumers will feel the pain as devices potentially get more expensive and software changes begin to creep into their Android smartphones. If appeals rulings uphold the initial verdict, the mobile ecosystem as we know it will look very different in one to two years. This would be driven by fundamental changes in the look and feel of non-Apple phone hardware, changes to the Android mobile operating system and potentially the emergence of a third popular mobile operating system. Smartphone market changes coming . Android phones account for 56% of the U.S. smartphone market. Friday's ruling was very sobering for the Android device manufacturers that have driven this growth. Until recently, smartphone design patent ownership seemed like a gray area. The court has now made it clear that, in fact, it is very black and white. All phone manufacturers will need to be a lot more careful from here on out when it comes to design, and patents they want to avoid, license or partner on. This could result in phones being more expensive for consumers. Over the next year, consumers lose in this equation. Android phone makers will be scrambling to develop temporary workarounds to steer clear of any potentially infringing Apple patents. The time spent working on these fixes will reduce time spent on development of new, innovative features. In the case of Samsung, it is likely the only device manufacturer with the resources and scale to develop and implement fixes rapidly, mitigating the immediate impact on consumers. If there are other phone makers in Apple's sights, they will be taking advantage of a much-needed head start to begin developing workarounds now to avoid a lawsuit. Sure, Android consumers could always turn to Apple, but some are turned off by the company's one phone per year release schedule and continued hesitancy to incorporate the latest mobile advances such as 4G and larger screens. Consumers who want to stay in the open and highly-customizable Android ecosystem could experience some temporary frustration. Creating the next iconic device . This ruling could prove to be the catalyst for major industry change. Smartphone product roadmaps are all but decided for the next year. Beyond that, every device manufacturer will be thinking outside of the ""rectangular slab form-factor"" box in an attempt to create the next big consumer trend. This will be easier said than done given that consumers have become accustomed to the current crop of devices. Device manufacturers know that consumers can't tell them what they want, they can only tell them what they don't want. This will result in phone makers traveling into unchartered territory in the hopes of capturing consumer attention and emotion. Choice will likely also come in the way of new mobile operating system platforms. It is no coincidence that Microsoft and Nokia's stock opened higher the day after the ruling. Apple stated during the trial that these companies have proven that it is possible to innovate in the smartphone market without copying Apple. Of course, Apple does have patent and design agreements with Microsoft and both companies have a mutual interest in slowing Android growth. As wireless carriers and device manufacturers seek to diversify their product lineup in the wake of the ruling, Microsoft might finally have its day in mobile. It is very likely that we'll eventually see a three horse mobile operating system race among Apple, Android and Microsoft. Short term is not pretty, but long term looks good . The short-term might not be pretty, but long-term, the industry is poised to break free from the homogenous rounded rectangular slabs with grid-based apps we're all familiar with today. This ruling will encourage accelerated innovation from device manufacturers, which will move beyond the constraints of a single form factor. Ultimately, the consumer will choose what designs will win and which implementation of hardware and software integration is most elegant. Today's constraints will define how the industry will innovate tomorrow. It might be a tough road, but there are promising days ahead.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong art collector Alan Lo and his father share a love for Chinese art. The younger Lo buys modern Chinese art; his dad owns an important collection of traditional Chinese ink drawings. In the past, they've sold some of their pieces at auction without much drama. However, there was one particularly frustrating transaction. ""My dad encountered an experience where he sold a piece of work upwards of $5 million to $10 million. It took the buyer almost half a year to pay the auction house,"" Lo recalls, saying the anonymous buyer was most likely from mainland China. Whether it's a cultural issue or a calculated financial move, non-payment causes major headaches for all players involved. The sellers don't get their money, the auction house doesn't get its commission, and storage and insurance costs add up. ""With big-ticket items, it's becoming more and more of a concern with mainland buyers. To a certain extent, they have less of a tendency to follow the rules of the game,"" Lo says. ""Sometimes, it's not so much about the money. They just can't be bothered. Their attitude is, 'I'm such a big customer. I can't be bothered. Maybe I'll pay a third now and then another third later'."" The rise in deadbeat art buyers in the region comes in tandem with Asia's growing importance in the global art market. ""Up until 2008, Asia was 2% to 4% of group sales,"" says Francois Curiel, president of Christie's Asia. ""Today, 25% of our buyers come from this region."" ""Mainland buyers not paying seems to be a phenomenon that's increasingly prevalent,"" says fine art consultant Jonathan Crockett, based in Hong Kong. ""They always have the money but they don't necessarily want to spend it. Yet, they still want the art. They want the best of both worlds."" Crockett's worst experience was overseeing a transaction in which the buyer took two years to pay up. Sotheby's has been bitten hard in the past and now takes a very aggressive stance against deadbeat auction winners. Sotheby's Asia has filed 13 lawsuits since 2007 with five cases still unresolved. ""Our lawsuits do not mean that we are experiencing more defaults than other auction houses. It just means that we take our obligations to our consignors seriously and are willing to take this step when necessary to protect them,"" Kevin Ching, CEO of Sotheby's Asia, wrote in an email to CNN. Sotheby's recently sued two mainland buyers, Ma Dong and Ren Chunxia, because they hadn't paid for winning bids that totaled $15 million. Sotheby's confirms Ren has since settled her payment while the case against Ma is still winding its way through Hong Kong's High Court. While mainland buyers get most of the bad rap, industry insiders say the problem also exists among buyers from other emerging markets like Indonesia and Malaysia. Christie's Asia says the problem is not a major issue for the auction house today but it was a problem back in 2010. ""I always wondered why someone would come to an auction, raise their hand and bid, and decide not to pay afterward,"" says Curiel. ""I thought it was something new for some customers -- like going to a gallery, deciding to buy and the next day changing their mind. I suppose it was because some collectors were new to the auction game and were not familiar with it."" As a safeguard, major auction houses often require significant deposits before the bidding takes place. Last October, Sotheby's introduced an across-the-board deposit policy in which prospective bidders must put down a minimum deposit of HK $200,000 (US$25,800). At Christie's Asia ""we ask you to pay a 20% deposit on what we think you're going to buy ... If you win the bid, that 20% goes toward the sale,"" says Curiel. ""If not, we return the money to you the day after the auction."" Before an auction, both Sotheby's and Christie's ask for bank references from bidders or talk to major dealers to find out if the bidder has a good track record. Still, buyer and seller beware. ""The risk is inherent. Art is generally not the most liquid of assets. It's probably one of the most illiquid in terms of worth. So people trying to put off payment is just part of that,"" cautions Crockett. Lo explains why the risk may be worth taking at auction, compared to buying art through a gallery or middleman. ""Chances are you are still getting the best price at auction,"" he says. ""The risk is higher and there's more concern about getting payment, but it's the risk the seller has to take.""","As art sales in China grow, so are the difficulties receiving payment for auction buys .

"New York (CNN) -- The Space Shuttle Enterprise made its final descent Wednesday, landing at its new home at New York City's Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum. Though it never traveled into outer space, the Enterprise did make its way from a Smithsonian Institution museum near Washington, above the New York skyline mounted atop a 747 jumbo jet, and up the Hudson River by barge to the museum where it will be displayed for the public. On Wednesday, the shuttle was hoisted by crane and then lowered onto the flight deck of the Intrepid, the decommissioned U.S. aircraft carrier that has been transformed into a museum. Dragon returns to Earth after 'grand slam' mission . As the shuttle moved through the waterways of Lower Manhattan, it made an appearance near the Statue of Liberty. A wingtip of the shuttle was damaged slightly on Sunday during its transit from John F. Kennedy Airport to Weeks Marine in Jersey City, New Jersey, where it was held until Tuesday, according to a statement by Intrepid museum officials. It has since been repaired. The shuttle was on display at a Smithsonian Institution museum before being flown from Virginia's Dulles International Airport on April 27 and making its final flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. Discovery -- the most traveled of the shuttles -- is replacing Enterprise in the Smithsonian facility. Completed in 1976, Enterprise was designed as a prototype test vehicle. Test pilots demonstrated that it could fly and land in the atmosphere like airplanes, but the Enterprise never flew in space. The shuttle was originally to be named the Constitution, but a write-in campaign by fans of the television series ""Star Trek"" persuaded officials to rename it in honor of the show's main starship. NASA sent the shuttle on a tour of Europe and Canada in 1983, and it appeared at the 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans. The craft made a brief return to service as a ground test vehicle in 1984 before retiring to the Smithsonian's collection in 1985. NASA is preparing to fly Space Shuttle Endeavour to Los Angeles sometime in the second half of the year. The final remaining shuttle, Atlantis, is being readied for display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida. The other two shuttles in the NASA program, Challenger and Columbia, were destroyed in flight.","Space Shuttle Enterprise is hoisted by crane into its new home .

"New York (CNN) -- A veteran New York City bus driver on Tuesday played down any claims of heroism for snagging a 7-year-old girl who fell three stories from a Brooklyn apartment building a day earlier. Steve St. Bernard, 52, says neighborhood children alerted him to the girl standing on top of a window air-conditioning unit, and he positioned himself underneath her. ""I asked God ... I said, 'Let me catch her, please. Don't let me miss,'"" the 10-year veteran of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) told CNN. ""I don't play baseball. I'm not a sportsman. I don't want to miss."" St. Bernard said the girl was up above him for an excruciating seven minutes before she fell into his arms. Man saves woman during shark attack . The incident occurred Monday afternoon and was captured on amateur video, which soon surfaced online. It shows the girl, who neighbors said is a special-needs child, standing and apparently dancing on the air-conditioner, losing her balance and falling. One of at least two people standing on the sidewalk beneath her reaches out and catches her before she hits the ground. ""It felt like a ton of bricks ... like a whole bag of rocks on me,"" St. Bernard said. ""We went down. She touched the floor but the impact wasn't on her. It was me and her going down. I guess I absorbed the blow."" Bernard and the girl were treated at a local hospital and released. Bernard hurt his arm and is now wearing a sling and can't go to work. Neighbors and onlookers have since hailed the bus driver as a hero while police investigate the incident, authorities said. The child apparently was able to get onto an exterior air-conditioning unit because the window guards were too small for the opening, said New York City Housing Authority spokeswoman Sheila Stainback. There are now child-proof bars in place and the air conditioner unit has been removed from the window. The girl's mother told CNN affiliate WCBS that she thought her daughter was asleep and blamed the incident on the air conditioner, which she said was installed just a few days ago and was defective. Deborah Reed, a witness who alerted the girl's mother that her child was standing on the air conditioner, was emotional about the whole ordeal. ""I am just so thankful that everything turned out well -- I really am,"" she said. But most grateful was the girl's mother, who hugged and thanked St. Bernard on Tuesday. Still, the bus driver is brushing aside the ""hero"" label. ""If you have kids or you love people, like me, it's something you jump into action real quickly,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Even before Apple came out with its iPhone five years ago, it was experimenting with iPad-like tablets. NetworkWorld did some digging in court filings and unearthed some of the earliest known photos of an iPad prototype. BuzzFeed then fleshed out the discovery with color photos of the device next to an actual iPad. Called the 035 mockup, the glass-screened device was double the thickness of the first iPad, about an inch thick compared to .5 inches for the Apple tablet that hit stores in 2010. (The latest version of the iPad is even thinner, at .37 inches.) The mockup is longer and wider than the iPad, closer in size to a MacBook then the current iPad. It has the iPad's rounded corners and dark black frame around the screen. One feature that's notably missing is the Home button. The back is a glossy white shell, similar to the classic iPods, with a nice big Apple logo in the middle. Google's Nexus 7 tablet ships this week . The court documents are part of the ongoing patent fights between Apple and Samsung. As part of the case, Jonathan Ive, Apple's senior vice president of industrial design, was deposed in December of last year. Ive was shown the mockup of the big tablet and said, ""I recognize this as one of the ... models that we made as part of the design process, as part of the exploration."" He believes it was kicking around Apple as early as 2002. Samsung is fighting Apple's claims the the Galaxy Tab infringes on the iPad's design. The latest interesting ruling in the case came on Thursday, when a UK court said Apple had to post a note on its UK site for six months and run a notice in British newspapers saying that Samsung did not copy the iPad design. Apple is appealing the ruling. The idea that Apple was playing with glass-screen tablets before the iPhone is not new. Steve Jobs first talked about the unusual evolution of the iOS product line at the AllThingsD conference in 2010. ""I had this idea about having a glass display, a multitouch display you could type on with your fingers. I asked our people about it. And six months later, they came back with this amazing display."" said Jobs. He realized the technology could be used to create a phone, and the rest is history.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Department of Homeland Security is now collecting scans of all 10 fingerprints from foreign travelers entering the United States at Dulles International Airport, and plans to extend the program to all international airports in the country by the end of next year. The program -- known as United States Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology, or US-VISIT -- had previously used only two fingerprints. The 10-print system gives the United States the ability to compare fingerprints of travelers with criminal and terrorist databases compiled by the FBI, the Defense Department and others. The new 10-print system was rolled out in late November at Dulles. Speaking at an event at the airport Monday, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff touted the new technology: ""We rely on biometrics, unique physical characteristics like fingerprints, to keep dangerous people out of the United States and at the same time to keep the lines moving so that travel is fast and convenient for legitimate citizens and visitors."" Chertoff said the two-fingerprint version of the program, which began in 2004, has already been successful, claiming that the program had stopped ""almost 2,000 criminals and immigrant violators based on their fingerprints alone."" Canadians and Mexicans using government-issued identification cards are exempt from the program. Privacy advocates such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center claim the system puts personal information at risk. A July 2007 Government Accountability Office report found that ""systems supporting the US-VISIT program have significant information security control weaknesses that place sensitive and personally identifiable information at increased risk of unauthorized and possibly undetected disclosure and modification, misuse and destruction."" DHS insists that there have been no privacy breaches in the US-VISIT program. Chertoff played down risks. ""Moving to 10 fingerprints is completely consistent with, and in fact enhances, our ability to protect,"" he said. ""We view privacy as a fundamental human right and preserving it is an integral part of our mission."" Travel and tourism groups fear that more barriers to international travel will make foreigners less likely to visit the United States. Discover America Partnership, a trade group representing the tourism industry, is cautiously supporting the program, but urges a greater effort by the United States to make foreign travelers aware of the program. ""While reasonable, we must also recognize that the 10-finger scan technology may be perceived as a barrier to entry,"" said Geoff Freeman, executive director of Discover America Partnership, in a news release. ""We must balance this and other barriers with clear communications and a welcoming message."" E-mail to a friend .","The new 10-print system was rolled out in late November at Dulles .

"(CNN) -- Apple prides itself on being green. The gadget maker announced this year that it would power a data center in North Carolina ""using entirely renewable sources."" And it publishes environmental reports on each of its products, indicating whether they can be recycled and what steps the company is taking to reduce its impact on global climate change. But this has been a bad week for the company's green image. ""Apple computers are falling further from the tree of life and leaving a sour taste in some purchaser's mouths,"" wrote Tim Wall, a blogger for Discovery News. The first bit damaging of news was about Apple's decision to dump an international green certification system that is used by the U.S. government to determine whether its agencies can or cannot purchase a product. Apple would not comment on exactly why it abandoned the EPEAT environmental standard, which measures a product's recyclability and energy efficiency. The Internet, however, speculated widely that the company's new MacBook Pro line isn't easily recycled since the laptops' batteries are glued to their aluminum cases. And perhaps that was the reason Apple decided to pull out now, before those laptops were reviewed by EPEAT. Then came Greenpeace. On Thursday, a report from that environmental group challenged Apple to tell the public how, exactly, it plans to make its data centers 100% green. ""This new ambition to be 'coal free' is welcome news for the 125 million current iCloud users, and represents a significant improvement in Apple's energy choices,"" Greenpeace wrote. ""However, many details and questions remain about how Apple will achieve its 100% renewable goal from the public dialogue Greenpeace International has had with the company. ""Two of Apple's three current data centers operate in regions that are 50-60% coal powered, and will require significant new investment or a clear decision by Apple to buy electricity from cleaner sources in order to be considered coal free."" Because of Apple's recent statements about clean energy, however, Greenpeace actually raised the company's grades for the environmental friendliness of its data centers from Ds and an F, which it gave the company in April, to Cs and Ds. ""As a large and rapidly growing energy user, Apple cannot be a sustainability leader if it remains a passive recipient of the electricity it is provided from dirty utilities,"" the Greenpeace report says (PDF). ""To show true leadership, the company has to be willing to use its influence to change the electricity ecosystem outside the walls of its data centers as well."" Specifically, Greenpeace says, Apple should pressure Duke Energy, which it says provides power to its North Carolina data center, to produce energy by cleaner means and to end its ""mountaintop coal removal operations"" from Apple's supply chain. In a statement issued to CNN by e-mail, an Apple spokeswoman said the company's existing data centers will not use coal energy by early next year. ""We're committed to building the world's most environmentally responsible data centers and are leading the industry in the use of renewable energy, including the nation's largest private solar arrays and non-utility fuel cell installation,"" the statement said. ""As we've said before, our North Carolina and California data centers will be coal-free as of February 2013 and our newest data centers in Oregon and Nevada will be designed to meet that standard from Day One."" Apple operates a data center in Maiden, North Carolina, as well as one in Prineville, Oregon, the report says. The company is planning data centers in Reno, Nevada, and Newark, California, according to the report. The location of those data centers is important, Greenpeace argues, because data centers -- basically big warehouses full of computers that store data ""in the cloud"" or online rather than on home machines -- are such big users of electricity. Apple uses data centers for its iCloud service, which lets users store music, photos and documents on the Internet/ where they can be accessed from several devices. Environmental groups pressure tech companies to locate their data centers in places where green power is available or where less energy will be required to cool the plant. Data centers account for about 1.5% of total electricity consumption in the United States, according to a 2007 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. As tech companies like Apple, Amazon and Google expand the offerings of their cloud computing services, the amount of power going into data centers continues to grow. Greenpeace's Thursday report, titled ""A Clean Energy Road Map for Apple,"" also calls on Apple to take several other specific steps if it wants to meet its goals of using 100% green energy. Among its recommendations, it says Apple should: . • Buy renewable energy for its data center in Oregon instead of purchasing renewable energy credits from Pacific Power. • Create on-site power sources, find a source of biogas and retire its renewable energy credits from on-site power at its North Carolina data center. • Create a policy for future data centers' locations that prioritizes the availability of renewable energy sources. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. In the Greenpeace report, Google, Facebook and Dell generally got better marks than Apple. Amazon ranked worse than Apple, earning Fs for transparency and its decisions about where to place its data centers. Scores for those other companies were carried over from an April report and will be re-evaluated on a company-by-company basis this year, Greenpeace says.","Greenpeace: Apple needs to do more to reach its clean energy goals .

"(CNN) -- Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is attempting to flip attacks on his business record by accusing the Obama administration of shipping American jobs overseas, but experts in the industry he's singling out say the truth is more complicated. ""It's interesting when it comes to outsourcing, this president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs by putting money into energy companies that end up making their products outside the U.S.,"" Romney told an audience in Colorado on Tuesday. ""If there's an outsourcer-in-chief, it's the president of the United States, not the guy running to replace him."" It's an attempt at political jujitsu -- or as White House spokesman Jay Carney put it, a jeer of ""I know you are but what am I?"" Dems, GOP worlds apart in Washington . A website put up by the Republican Party lists case after case of international companies that received federal money aimed at building up a domestic renewable energy industry or developing electric vehicles. Much of it came from the Obama administration's 2009 economic stimulus bill, and the Romney campaign and the GOP say that taxpayer money created jobs overseas. ""It turns out President Obama is the outsourcer. You certainly won't hear about this from the Obama campaign,"" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in an e-mail to reporters. But the programs the GOP paints as ""outsourcing"" have contributed to a boom in wind and solar energy projects in particular, according to industry groups and independent analysts. That led to the creation of between 52,000 and 75,000 jobs in the sector between 2009 and 2011, according to an April estimate from the Lawrence-Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The range reflects some uncertainty about how much of those projects' component parts were made in the United States. That's because there were few American companies manufacturing those components in the last decade. ""You can't outsource jobs that weren't here in the first place,"" said Russ Choma, an investigative journalist who documented the role of overseas corporations in the federal energy programs in 2010. Choma said the plan was to encourage those companies to locate in the United States, a plan that has worked to some extent. ""You can't just will a manufacturing industry to arise,"" he said. ""You have to create a market for it. The market needs the turbines from somewhere, so they had to go overseas with hopes that it would spur activity here."" Wind-powered electrical production more than doubled between 2008 and 2011, and now represents just under 3% of U.S. generation, Energy Information Administration figures show. The American Wind Energy Association, the agency's trade group, said the number of workers building components for the industry has grown from about 4,000 in 2005 to about 30,000 in 2012. About 60% of wind-turbine components are now made in the United States, up from about 25% in 2005, the trade group said. Romney draws boos from NAACP, support from conservatives . The GOP website criticizes the fact that employment in the entire wind energy sector has declined by 10,000 despite the federal investment of nearly $9 billion from the 2009 economic stimulus bill. But the industry said that's largely because there are fewer jobs installing wind farms right now, and that the stimulus program saved as many as 40,000 of the 85,000 jobs in the industry at its peak. Those programs provided tax credits to wind-farm developers, and all those projects ""are built in the U.S.,"" the American Wind Energy Association said. Choma said the result was a ""huge"" growth in installed capacity, but fewer jobs than predicted. Other programs haven't been as successful, and the end of the programs in the stimulus bill could bring the renewable energy industry's recent momentum to a ""screeching halt,"" he said. The ""outsourcer-in-chief"" attack is Romney's rebuttal to criticism of his business record by the Obama campaign and its allies, who accuse the onetime Bain Capital chief of being a ""pioneer"" of shipping American jobs overseas. Obama partisans cite reporting by the Washington Post, which published a lengthy piece on Romney's record at Bain in June, but the newspaper's fact-checking column has said the campaign has stretched the paper's findings. ""There is an element here of 'I know you are but what am I?' to this charge, but the facts tell a different story,"" Carney said Wednesday. He said the stimulus money ""went to operations in the Unites States that created jobs for American workers here at home."" Meanwhile, observers like Robert Scott, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, say Obama hasn't done enough to crack down on outsourcing. ""There's no question that there's concerns about candidate Romney, that he has outsourced in the past and indicated that he continues to favor tax policies that would subsidize companies that would outsource,"" said Scott. ""On the other hand, Obama has had four years to undertake major steps to reduce our trade deficit. He's done the small things."" CNN Poll of Polls: Dead heat in Obama-Romney race . The administration has come out in favor of shifting tax breaks away from companies that move jobs overseas and toward companies that bring them back to the United States, but those moves have gone nowhere in Congress. Scott said the Obama administration has stepped up enforcement actions against unfair trade practices by Chinese companies. But it ""hasn't taken the big steps"" like taking Beijing to task for keeping its currency artificially low, which favors Chinese exports. Obama, Romney ratchet up back and forth over outsourcing . Romney says he 'expected' negative response . CNN's Brianna Keilar, Adam Aigner-Treworgy and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Romney campaign attacks stimulus funding for overseas energy companies .

"(CNN) -- A new feature from Google will let you e-mail just about anyone with a Google+ account, and, in turn, give them the ability to e-mail you. The feature, announced on the official Gmail blog, won't give your actual e-mail address to strangers. But when a Gmail user begins typing in the address box, it will provide suggestions including people in their Google+ network. The idea, Google says, is to make it easier to contact friends and other contacts when you've forgotten, or never had, their e-mail address. But some early reactions suggested the new change may make it too easy. ""Oh god no.. Another reason to hate Google+,"" wrote Jeff Roberts, a reporter for tech blog GigaOM, on Twitter. ""They turned it into a stalking tool."" Others, like Chris Taylor of Mashable, said it looks like another attempt to push users to Google+, which, as a social network, has never presented a real challenge to Facebook, though Google has continued to integrate it into other, more popular, products like YouTube and, now, Gmail. ""What (CEO Larry) Page and Google seem maddeningly unaware of is that nobody can ever be forced into having a party,"" Taylor wrote. ""That in fact, the forcing is what makes a party impossible."" Google, clearly anticipating the privacy concerns, notes that users may limit the feature, or opt out of it entirely. While the default G+ setting will allow anyone on Google+ to contact you, users may limit that access to people in their Circles on the network, or to nobody at all. There are other limits, too. A user may only e-mail you using the system once if you don't reply (addressing the stalking concerns, perhaps). And messages from people who are not in your G+ Circles will go into the ""Social"" folder, along with other posts from sites like G+, Facebook and Twitter, instead of the user's primary inbox. Google said the feature will be rolling out to Gmail and Google+ users over the next couple of days, when they will receive a message with a link to the feature.","New feature means all Google+ users can e-mail each other .

"DEATH VALLEY, California (CNN) -- Today, you get a call from a friend. They need a favor. Runners chase each other during the first 20 miles of Badwater. Would you mind spending your vacation time this summer in Death Valley, a desert where temperatures hover around 130 degrees? Would you be OK with sleeping in a van, if you get to sleep at all, for three days, because you'll be working your tail off spraying runners down with water, dunking them in ice and keeping track of everything that goes in (and -- yes -- out) of their body every 15 minutes so they don't die running 135 miles in the hardest footrace on the planet? ""Yeah, man, it's Badwater. You don't turn down a chance to be at Badwater,"" Mark Paterson said, adjusting his visor as sweat soaked his face. He pulls at his shirt, trying to create some air, pointlessly. It was 4 p.m. and 126 degrees in a Death Valley village called Furnace Creek, what whoever coined the phrase, 'Hell on earth' had in mind. ""You get that call and you do what's right,"" Paterson said. ""You make sure your runner gets the ultimate bragging right, maybe the biggest big deal of all, the event that makes everyone else go, 'Badwater? Oh, no, man, you did not just do that!' "" Paterson was right. The Adventurecorps Badwater Ultramarathon is infamous in endurance sports circles. It is the running equivalent of summiting Everest, the ultimate test of mental fortitude, a hippy communion with the desert of epic highs and lows (literally -- the race starts at 280 feet below sea level, the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere, covers three mountain ranges for descents and ascents totaling 9,000 feet and ends halfway up Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States). For all the nonsweaters out there -- consider how long it takes to drive from Baltimore to New York. Now imagine running that distance...without sleep...with 10,000 blow dryers pointed at you the entire time.  Watch what it takes to battle Badwater »  All that for a belt buckle? You apply to Badwater the way you apply to Harvard. Runners from across the world try to wow a finicky race jury by submitting awesome scores (provable race finishing times from at least two 100-mile events) and an essay conveying they have the stamina to tackle such a gnarly challenge. Gnarly meaning blisters that turn feet into pizza; dehydration that can lead to organ and brain damage, heat stroke and hyponatremia; a salt imbalance that makes extremities swell like sausages. For good measure, let's throw in heat and sleep-deprivation induced hallucinations. The entry fee is $795 (steep, sure, but an eight-person medical team, insurance, supplies and logistics to stage a monster event in the middle of nowhere ain't cheap). Crews aren't paid. The prize at the race often called Satan's Fun Run, should one finish in less than 48 hours, is a thick silver belt buckle.  See the runners, the finish and the buckle » . ""To talk about the buckle is to miss the point,"" said Marshall Ulrich, a 58-year-old endurance sensei who has done Badwater more than a dozen times and has summited Everest. Notorious for having his toenails surgically removed -- toenails fall off anyway when you're an endurance runner -- Marshall is, contrary to what most people assume, not a machine. He started running when he was 28, after his doctor told him to get off his butt and lower his blood pressure or expect an early grave.  See interactive map of route, distance, elevation » . ""You run Badwater because there's something in you that wants to get out there, in the middle of nowhere, and think about something. It's a way of freeing yourself, getting back to what I really believe people are supposed to be doing instead of relying so much on a bunch of material crap that only makes us weaker. We are built to run, to cover great distance, for survival sake."" Slightly less extreme, the women's winner of Badwater, two years in a row, is Jamie Donaldson, a middle school math teacher from Colorado. A lawyer, politician, small business owner, real estate agent and a college student ran Badwater this year, and its overall winner, coming in at 23:39:18, was Marcos Farinazzo, a 40-year-old hospital worker from Brazil. The oldest runner this year was 67-year-old Arthur Webb, who has finished 10 consecutive Badwaters. Race officials using walkie-talkies (there's no cell service in Death Valley) counted him out at mile 17 where he cramped and jumped in a pool to cool down. Time, ice and a few massages later, Webb was on the course again, not stopping until he crossed the finish line more than 40 hours later. Good crew, good race -- probably . ""First, you gotta have your hydration log. How much has your runner had to drink, how much do they need,"" Paterson said. ""Endurolytes, quarters of peanut butter sandwiches, something fizzy for when they start having digestion issues -- 'cause they're gonna have 'em -- your various tapes and bandages for the feet, Neosporin, Preparation H, animal cookies,"" he said. ""We jump out of that van every quarter mile with two buckets. I got my bucket of water and ice with a straight block of ice and a bucket of ice and sports drink. The runner gets every other one, you rotate."" The grossest but most necessary job? ""You have to check if their urine is clear, so you better be looking at that, and they better be going often,"" Paterson said. As the race wore on, its 60-hour course limit blurring the days, plastic cups labeled with runners' names who'd suffered serious dehydration began dotting a hotel room that served as Badwater's medical center. They looked filled with varying concentrations of apple juice, one redder than the next. Paterson's runner Tim Kjenstad, a 51-year-old California firefighter, has run Badwater before, but this year, sacked by severe dehydration and bodily functions that don't need to be mentioned, he had to DNF (the dreaded initials for Did Not Finish) at mile 44. ""Nobody can say that running 135 miles in the desert is healthy,"" said Dr. Lisa Stranc Bliss, the head of the medical staff, who herself has run Badwater. ""But I'm not going to say it isn't one of the most incredible experiences of your life."" Beyond the physical, there's an emotional bond forged between crew members and runners that military types call ""embracing the suck."" The wife of a Brazilian runner, Cas Camara, who came in dead last far past the 60-hour mark, screamed and cried and begged her husband, who had fallen to the ground, his body seemingly wasted, to get up, get up and finish. Members of a Navajo tribe and an entire family, tiny kids included, packed into a van to follow one runner. When Arnold Begay reached his breaking point, two of the men lifted him to his feet and a woman cupped his face and sang to him. He went on. Some crewers ran 80 kilometers, completely anonymously, just to keep their runner on a specific pace. Many were exhausted from running their own ultramarathons only weeks before. Badwater's past champ, Hungarian Akos Konya crewed for 19-year-old Arizona college student Nick Hollon who made history as the event's youngest ever competitor. ""Nick emailed me and said how would you like to help me,"" explained Konya, hovering over his runner Nick Hollon at mile 72. Hollon was in pain. The teen's feet were chewed and he was about to take a needle to his blisters. Konya, skinny and fast as a Greyhound, put his hand on Hollon's shoulder. He seemed shocked by the question -- Why would you go through Badwater to help out a kid you barely know? ""Why would I not help him do this? He asked me. I don't understand why you would say no.""","Badwater Ultramarathon is 135 miles through one of the hottest deserts in the world .

"(CNN) -- Standard & Poor's move lowering the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+ shook global markets over the weekend as traders reacted to the news. Shares dipped across the Middle East Sunday as the region's exchanges were among the first global markets to open since the historic downgrade. Israel's  stock market fell more than 6%, and the Tel Aviv 25 Index ended the trading day down  6.99%. The Dubai Financial Market (DFM) General Index fell 3.7% on Sunday. And the General Index on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange lost 2.5%. In Saudi Arabia, the Tadawul All-Share Index gained less than 0.1% after dropping nearly 5.5% Saturday. Analysts predict more slides as markets in other countries open Monday at the beginning of the work week there. U.S.  Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner will participate in a conference call  Sunday  evening with other representatives of Group of Seven  industrialized nations to discuss the downgraded  U.S. credit rating, a  G-7 official  told CNN. The G-7 nations are Canada, France, Germany,  Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United  States. The  Bank of Israel issued a statement Sunday aimed at reassuring investors. ""So far the debt crises abroad have had a  limited impact on Israel, due to its macroeconomic  strength, achieved by means of adherence to fiscal discipline, among other  things, in the last few years,"" the statement said. But one analyst said the U.S. debt crisis may be a symptom of a larger problem Israel faces. ""The United  States is in serious trouble, gradually  weakening, in a major crisis,"" said Pinchas Landau, an independent financial advisor in Israel and the publisher of the Landau  Report. ""This constitutes bad news for the state of  Israel. It means that the strategic,  financial, military, political backup for Israel is  weakening."" The move by S&P, one of the leading credit rating agencies, came Friday -- just days after Congress approved a deal to deliver $2.1 trillion in savings over the next decade. The deal followed heated debt-ceiling talks in Washington. One person close to S&P's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating told CNN Saturday that the agency expects the action to have ""very mild real-world impact."" Rating agencies such as S&P, Moody's and Fitch analyze risk and give debt a grade that is supposed to reflect the borrower's ability to repay its loans. The safest bets are stamped AAA. That's where the U.S. debt has stood for years. Moody's first assigned the United States an AAA rating in 1917. Fitch and Moody's, the other two main credit ratings agencies, maintained the AAA rating for the United States after last week's debt deal, though Moody's lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to ""negative."" A negative outlook indicates the possibility that Moody's could downgrade the country's sovereign credit rating within a year or two. Stock market values fell Friday across Europe and Asia, where reaction to news of the U.S. credit downgrade was mixed. A scathing editorial in the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency criticized the United States for living outside its means. ""China, the largest creditor of the world's sole superpower, has every right now to demand the United States to address its structural debt problems and ensure the safety of China's dollar assets,"" the editorial said. ""To cure its addiction to debts, the United States has to re-establish the common sense principle that one should live within its means."" CNN's Athena Jones, Guy Azriel, Deborah Doft and John Raedler contributed to this report.","NEW: G-7 nations will hold a conference call to discuss the downgraded rating .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a warm brew of lager so heady you had to plunge a straw through the thick surface scum to get to the fermented liquor below. Welcome to the favored brew of ancient Egypt's New Kingdom; a 3,200-year-old barley beer that a new archaeological find this month is shedding new light on. A Japanese team headed by Jiro Kondo of Waseda University stumbled on the tomb of ancient beer-maker Khonso Em Heb while cleaning the courtyard of another tomb at the Thebes necropolis in the Egyptian city of Luxor. The tomb, replete with highly colored frescoes, is being hailed as one of the most significant finds of recent times. Egypt's antiquities minister Mohamed Ibrahim described Khonso Em Heb as the chief ""maker of beer for gods of the dead"" adding that the tomb's chambers contain ""fabulous designs and colors, reflecting details of daily life... along with their religious rituals."" One fresco shows Khonso Em Heb -- who apart from being a brewer, headed the royal storehouses during the pharaonic Ramesside period (1,292--1,069 BC) -- making offerings to the gods along with his wife and daughter. The newly discovered tomb is to be placed under tight security until the excavation work is completed, the ministry said in a press statement. Read more: How not to do a desert adventure . According to Professor Poo Mun Chou, a leading Egyptologist at Hong Kong's Chinese University, the discovery is not only significant in terms of what it tells archaeologists about life during the New Kingdom period of Ancient Egypt, but marks a new direction for Egypt's beleaguered antiquities ministry. Still reeling from a disastrous break-in at the Cairo Museum in 2011 --- when looters smashed two mummies and made off with more than 50 artifacts --- Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities had slapped stringent restrictions on archaeological digs. For Professor Poo, the latest discovery is a sign that archeology in Egypt may be returning to normal. ""The significance in this find is that for quite some time archaeologists haven't been able to excavate an intact tomb,"" he said. ""An intact tomb will give us a more complete view of the funerary customs which can be compared with other tomb paintings."" He said the frescoes were well preserved. ""The Supreme Council of Antiquities has for some time had a policy of not excavating new tombs but preserving those tombs that have already been excavated. ""This is a new find and is quite unexpected."" Apart from the recent political turmoil in Egypt, which has led to a surge in the number of illegal digs and antiquities damaged by looters, Professor Poo said the sheer speed with which new discoveries were being made had meant the government was having difficulty keeping up with logging and preserving the finds. Read more: Razing the dead in Bahrain . Add to this the problem of protecting ancient tombs, which begin to degrade the moment they are opened, and Egypt's antiquities authorities have their work cut out for them. ""In Egypt, of course, the dry weather means the danger of this is less, but still after some time the color of the painting begins to fade away. ""That is why Egypt now has a stricter policy."" While foreign archaeological teams are still operating in Egypt, the political climate has made it more difficult for them to do their work. Even the International Association of Egyptologists (IAE) was told late last year that Egypt --- because of the political situation --- was unable to host the 2014 International Congress of Egyptologists. The IAE is currently seeking bids for a second country to host the prestigious congress. Meanwhile, historians and archaeologists are making use of the latest find while it is still available to be studied. ""Alcohol in ancient Egypt was very important -- not just in terms of daily consumption but also as an offering to deities. Beer, in particular was very important,"" said Poo. ""Beer during the New Kingdom period was probably one-fifth or even one-tenth the price of wine making it a very popular drink for people of all social strata."" Read more: Graffiti transforms Cairo's streets . While the appeal of beer across all social classes remains to this day, Professor Poo says the modern drinker might struggle to recognize the barley or millet-based beverage of ancient times. ""While it's a close cousin to modern beer, it's manufacture was more primitive and they had to use a tube to extract the liquid from below which would have had a fermented layer of substance floating on the top of the jar,"" he said. ""It would have had bubbles,"" he added.","Japanese archeologists unearth tomb of pharaonic beer brewer in Luxor .

"(CNN) -- More than five million Jeep vehicles are being investigated by the federal government for deadly fuel-tank fires caused by rear-impact collisions. Fiery fuel-tank crashes have resulted in 48 fatalities in the Jeep Grand Cherokee model since 1993, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but so far neither the federal government nor Chrysler has announced a recall. This week the NHTSA expanded the investigation to include Jeep Cherokees from model years 1993 to 2001 and Jeep Liberty models from 2002 to 2007. Federal investigators initially looked into the Jeep Grand Cherokee following complaints by the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog organization founded by Ralph Nader. The fuel tank of the 1993-2004 Grand Cherokee is made of plastic and extends below the rear bumper ""so there is nothing to protect the tank from direct hit"" in a rollover or rear-end collision, the watchdog group said in a letter sent to NHTSA. ""Chrysler Group has concluded that 1993-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles are neither defective nor do their fuel systems pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety in rear impact collisions,"" said a Chrysler statement obtained by CNN. Chrysler spokesman Mike Palese told CNN the company estimates two million of the affected vehicles are still on the road. ""We still feel confident these vehicles are safe. They have really, really good safety records,"" Palese said, adding, ""We feel really confident, and we'll work cooperatively with NHTSA."" The investigation could take a year to complete, possibly longer if it becomes complex, the NHTSA said. In 2005 and later models, Chrysler moved the gas tank of the Jeep Grand Cherokee from behind the rear-axle to the middle of the vehicle. Palese said that Chrysler made the move to allow more cargo space, not due to safety concerns. Since the change, there has been only one fatal fire crash in the redesigned vehicle, according to the Center for Auto Safety.","Fiery fuel-tank crashes have resulted in 48 deaths since 1993 .

"(CNN) -- Under President Obama, the United States of America has deported about 400,000 undocumented immigrants each year. That's an average of 1,100 people, including moms and dads and children, per day. These are people who are in the United States largely because our businesses lure-- and rely on--many of them to do the unskilled jobs Americans don't want to do. They are people who have come to the United States as generations came before, to feed their families and fulfill a dream. And we're kicking them out. Every day, in busloads. This weekend, thousands of undocumented immigrants and their allies took to the streets of Washington and communities across the country to demand that President Obama put an end to reckless and rampant deportations in America. ""Not one more,"" the marchers chanted. There are literally 11 million-plus reasons to stop deportations in the United States -- 11 million undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation every day. There is also the collateral damage done to their citizen families who don't want their lives torn apart and to their co-workers, employers and community members. So what are the reasons not to stop our abysmal, extreme rate of deportations? There are basically three. First, anti-immigrant activists insist that the people being deported are dangerous criminals — and that they should be deported faster and at even higher rates. Yet Monday, The New York Times released an analysis of government records revealing that of the nearly 2 million people deported since President Obama took office, two-thirds had no criminal record whatsoever or had committed only minor infractions, such as traffic violations. Sure, on a technical level anyone in the United States without official permission has broken the law. But let's not over-dramatize the reality. Technically, everyone who has ever driven above the speed limit or jaywalked has also broken the law. And many undocumented immigrants in the United States originally arrived with authorized work or travel visas and simply stayed in the country past the expiration date of their paperwork. This is the great ""crime"" that anti-immigrant activists insist all undocumented immigrants have committed, asserting that folks should instead ""get in line."" But the line is broken. Decades ago, it simply was easier for aspiring Americans to get green cards or visas for family members: The United States let more people in and made it easier for immigrants already here to bring along their families. Today, those ""lines"" are longer and harder to get into. And yet the economic need for immigrants, not to mention America's cultural imperative for inclusion and diversity, is unyielding. Our policies have simply not kept up. The second argument against stopping deportations is a tactical one, made especially by the White House in arguing that it needs to show toughness in immigration enforcement to increase its hand in pushing for comprehensive reform. But the fact is that even though President Obama's administration has deported more immigrants than any president before him, many Republicans still argue it isn't enough and backed off on their recent support of immigration reform, claiming they couldn't trust President Obama to implement any law if passed. If a record rate of deportation against undocumented immigrants with only the most minor of offenses has been insufficient to bring Republicans to the bargaining table, perhaps now the White House will finally realize that its self-destructive capitulation won't yield rational behavior on the part of Republicans. Today's Republicans seem perpetually willing to alienate increasingly vital Latino voters — and even big business interests who favor immigration reform—in favor of continuing to placate their loyal, but dying, old, white and socially narrow-minded voting base. The final argument against stopping deportations is that President Obama doesn't have the legal authority to do so. He does. Everyone from top constitutional lawers to The New York Times editorial board agree the President is well within his authority to determine how immigration enforcement resources are prioritized and deployed. And President Obama has already used his executive authority to grant temporary deportation relief to undocumented immigrants brought to America by their parents when they were young, so-called DREAMers who grew up in the United States and yet legally can't find a place in the only nation they've ever called home. What President Obama did for DREAMers is wonderful; now many of these kids can get in-state tuition or federal loans for college and go on to get good jobs as teachers and engineers our nation needs. But to only use his authority to grant relief for these most-sympathetic of immigrants would reflect the sort of political risk aversion that has so often typified our 44th president. The White House indeed has said it is using its executive discretion to only deport those immigrants with dangerous criminal records. As The New York Times reported, this is simply not true. Of the nearly 2 million immigrants the Obama administration has deported — a milestone we're expected to hit any day— at least 1.6 million of those deported were for minor offenses like traffic violations. In other words, overwhelmingly, we're not kicking violent offenders out of the country but moms and dads and hardworking aspiring Americans who got parking tickets and now are being ripped away from their families. The White House could legitimately and wisely reprioritize those law enforcement resources to investigate unsolved murders or sexual assaults or prevent terrorism or mass shootings. The arguments against stopping deportations are weak at best and getting weaker every day. We need comprehensive immigration reform in the United States to finally fix our broken immigration system and create a path to citizenship for undocumented Americans. But until Republicans are willing to do the right thing by immigrants, our economy and our nation's values, President Obama can and must stop the excessive deportations under his watch. Not one more.","Sally Kohn: Under Obama administration, some 400,000 immigrants a year deported .

"(CNN) -- Security has been heightened at Sweden's nuclear power plants after explosives were discovered on a vehicle entering a protected nuclear site, authorities said Thursday. The truck was stopped at the Ringhals nuclear power plant on Wednesday afternoon, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority said. The suspicious material was discovered before the vehicle had entered the protected area, it said. Police are now investigating suspected sabotage, said the plant's owner, Vattenfall. The ""explosive paste"" was uncovered by sniffer dogs during a routine security check, the company said in a statement. ""The discovered object could not have induced a serious damage at Ringhals,"" it said. ""Ringhals nuclear power plant is still in operation."" Officers patrolled the site overnight with bomb detection dogs but found nothing else, the company said. The plant has raised its security level to the second lowest level of 4 as a precaution, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority said. The country's two other nuclear power plant, in Forsmark and Oskarshamn, have also boosted their security measures following the discovery, it said. ""It is still assessed that there was no risk of an explosion because the explosive had no detonation device,"" the statement said. David Persson, a spokesman for the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, told CNN he believed it was the first time such an incident had occurred. The State Forensic Laboratory confirmed the substance was an explosive paste Thursday morning, Vattenfall said. Sweden has 10 reactors at its three nuclear plants.","The explosives were discovered before they entered a protected area, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Staffan de Mistura -- who has been the United Nations' top emissary in Iraq, Afghanistan and other once-volatile locales -- is moving on to Syria, in the hope of turning the tide after years of war there. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Thursday that de Mistura will take on role as the world body's official facilitator on Syria. That position as the U.N.'s Syria envoy was formerly held by Lakhdar Brahimi and, before that, former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Despite considerable, high-level efforts, neither managed to halt a conflict that -- according to the United Nations -- has left more than 150,00 dead and some 680,000 injured since it began in March 2011. Then there's the humanitarian crisis for the survivors, with the United Nations estimating that more than 9.3 million need help and that at least 6.5 million have been forced from their homes into other parts of Syria. Another 2.5 million are now refugees in neighboring countries. As Brahimi and Annan found, it's not easy for a U.N. envoy to do anything about this crisis, especially given the dug-in positions of the opposition and the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Ban expressed confidence that de Mistura's experience working ""in very delicate, difficult places like Iraq and Afghanistan"" will serve him well in his new post. ""He will bring all his expertise and experience to these very difficult negotiations for peace in Syria, so I am confident that he will be able to carry out his duty as special envoy,"" the U.N. leader said. De Mistura, a dual national of Sweden and Italy, began working with the United Nations in the mid-1970s. This career has included stops in Sudan, Ethopia, Vietnam and Somalia. His international prominence rose significantly with his time in Iraq starting in the 1990s, including as head of a Special Commission charged with dismantling weapons of mass destruction. He also led the U.N. mission in Iraq from 2007 to 2009. In January 2010, de Mistura was named the U.N. secretary-general's special representative to Afghanistan in the midst of more violence as well as talks involving the Taliban, which has fought against forces loyal to the Kabul-based central government. British Foreign Secretary William Hague was among those offering ""our strong support"" to de Mistura in his new effort to foster peace in Syria. ""His appointment comes at a time when the need for a political settlement in Syria has never been more pressing,"" Hague said. Reem Salahi, deputy legal director for the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces, said her group has been and continues to be willing to negotiate. That includes working to implement to so-called Geneva Comminique, which calls for a transitional government and eventual free elections as part of a political settlement to end the war -- something that al-Assad's government has not fully embraced. ""We hope that Mr. de Mistura is able to bring the Syrian regime to the table under the terms of the Geneva Comminique,"" Salahi told CNN. ""We are invested in a political transition. We are invested in seeing a democratic state."" Iran stands by U.N. envoy choice despite U.S. visa denial .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Richard Waltzer has a pitch for Cuba: Miller beer and Häagen-Dazs ice cream. If he has his way, those products soon will be available at supermarkets and beach resorts on the communist island. ""This is one of the things people are going to pay premium for,"" Waltzer said, ""especially the tourists that have the dollars. It's going to be a phenomenal product."" This week, dozens of Americans are in Havana, peddling their wares at an international trade fair: apples, pears, grapes, raisins, nuts out of California. U.S.-Cuba relations appear to be thawing. In Havana, billboards depicting the U.S. president as Adolf Hitler have disappeared. In Washington, President Obama has lifted restrictions on Cuban-American travel and money transfers. The new political climate has prompted companies such as Chicago Foods to come to Havana's trade fair for the first time. They're hoping to break into the little-known market and go home with a contract. Despite a trade embargo imposed against Cuba in 1962, the United States is the No. 1 supplier of food to that country and has been for more than five years. A law passed in 2000 allows the United States to export agricultural products and medicine. But this year, the global economic crisis is taking its toll. ""Cuba has not been an exception,"" said Rodrigo Malmierca Diaz, minister of foreign trade and investment. ""At the end of the third quarter in 2009, our trade fell by 36 percent."" The country is slashing imports of U.S. food by one-third, which means some vendors will go home empty-handed. But vendors are betting U.S.-Cuba relations will only get better. They said they're also hoping the next step could be bills in the U.S. Congress that would eliminate restrictions on all Americans traveling to Cuba. ""We're in this for the long haul as well,"" said Paul Johnson of Chicago Foods. ""Like I said before, we're thinking about today as well as tomorrow.""

"(EW.com)  -- The title question posed by the fumbled romantic comedy ""How Do You Know"" is open to more readings than writer-director James L. Brooks probably had in mind. The simplest interpretation is, how do you know when you're really in love? That's the dilemma faced by Lisa (Reese Witherspoon), a 31-year-old professional athlete at the end of her softball career, who bounces between two men. Should this compact, upbeat go-getter give her heart to Matty (Owen Wilson), a rich and famous major league baseball player whose vanity is offset by his sunny guilelessness and who offers great sex and good times? Or is she better off with George (Paul Rudd), a sweet but anxious businessguy who, as the naïve target of a federal investigation into business shenanigans, is watching his life fall apart? Consider the character types, consider the familiar personas of the actors who play them -- Wilson the loopy blond operator, Rudd the cute brunet everyshlub -- and you've got your answer even before you buy a ticket. The deeper meaning of Brooks's title, meanwhile, is this: How do you know what the right thing to do is, both in the big picture of life and in the moment? Business ethics and family responsibilities challenge George and his father, Charles (Brooks regular Jack Nicholson, broadly over-spluttering), a hard-charging financial tycoon who also happens to be George's boss. Lisa needs to devise a new career plan now that her days at bat are over. Even George's loyal, very pregnant office assistant (Kathryn Hahn) wrestles with the ethics of sharing confidential information -- as well as with the terrors of impending single motherhood. All this to-ing and fro-ing, this trying and failing on the way to (excuse the shrink talk) self-actualization is rich material for an expansive romantic comedy of psychological substance -- the kind, indeed, that Brooks has made his feature-film specialty, from ""Terms of Endearment"" and the great ""Broadcast News to the sour Spanglish."" But something doesn't connect here. Scenes go flat, punchlines foul out. And a sympathetic but frustrated fan of the filmmaker's stories and characters is entitled to ask, why doesn't ""How Do You Know"" know what to do from scene to scene? The answer, I think, is partly structural and script-driven: the ''funny'' moments are whiffed, the dialogue is ''scene-y,'' and each reaction shot is held a second or ten too long, leaving the actors hanging. EW.com: See all of this week's reviews . But the bigger reason may be because only one character really fascinates Brooks, and that's Lisa the athlete. Her energy is palpable. Her suitors, in contrast -- especially Matty the player, who keeps a closet full of pink loungewear on his shelves for his many visiting ladies -- are more plot-functional than three-dimensional, even when Rudd gives adorable, well-meaning haplessness his best, Ruddiest shot. ""How Do You Know"" asks really good questions but doesn't so much answer them as toss the ball from player to player until the clock runs out.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A court fined former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and gave him a one-year suspended jail sentence Monday, more than two months after he was found guilty of breach of trust. Olmert was ordered to pay a fine of 75,000 new Israeli shekels (about $19,000). As part of his sentencing by the Jerusalem District Court, he was also cleared to run for political office. ""I am entering this court with my head high, I am also leaving the court with my head high,"" Olmert said after the sentencing, according to his attorney, Eli Zohar. Monday's suspended jail sentence means Olmert will not serve jail time unless he commits the same crime within a three-year period. In a trial that ended in July, Olmert was found guilty of breach of trust but was acquitted on two corruption-related charges. The allegations stemmed from 2002 to 2006, when Olmert served a second term as mayor of Jerusalem and held several Cabinet posts under then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Prosecutors accused Olmert of double-billing government agencies for travel, taking cash from an American businessman in exchange for official favors and acting on behalf of his former law partner's clients. ""The court decided that I breached trust. I honor the decision of the court, and will learn the lessons from this,"" Olmert said outside the courtroom in July. ""I want to remind you that the court said that there were procedural problems -- not corruption, I never got anything. I acted in a way which was counter to procedure. I honor that, and take it to my heart."" At the time, he said nothing about his political future and thanked his lawyers for their work. Olmert became prime minister in 2006 after succeeding Sharon, who suffered a massive stroke. He announced his resignation in August 2008 after Israeli police recommended that he stand trial. He left office after a new government took power in March 2009. Earlier this year, Olmert told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that millions of dollars from the ""extreme right wing"" in the United States helped oust him from government and derailed a peace plan with the Palestinians. In 2008, Olmert sought a ""full comprehensive peace between us and the Palestinians"" -- a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. But the plan was never realized, and Olmert was forced from office, accused of corruption. He denied the allegations. ""I had to fight against superior powers, including millions and millions of dollars that were transferred from this country (the United States) by figures which were from the extreme right wing that were aimed to topple me as prime minister of Israel. There is no question about it,"" he told CNN. Pressed to name names, Olmert replied: ""Next time.""

The bill, which was approved by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies and is now before the Senate, would rewrite some of the rules regarding protected areas, grant amnesty to illegal deforestation that occurred before July 2008, and give states greater control over preservation management. Supporters say that the bill will help landowners, especially small ones -- a large number of whom currently violate existing conservation laws. By changing the way that land set aside for preservation is calculated, it would help many get back within the law. But opponents say easing deforestation laws will give a greenlight to developers and loggers to fell more of the Amazon Rainforest. On Friday, Brazil's Catholic Church announced that it would count on its 12,000 parishes to circulate a petition against the reforms, the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency reported. ""Our main concern is the impact and consequences of a law of this size on people's lives and the environment,"" the church said in a statement. ""We urge our communities to participate in the process of reform of the Forest Code, mobilizing social forces and promoting a petition against the devastation,""  the statement said. Last year, the church was able to collect more than 1 million signatures on a petition regarding another piece of legislation, Agencia Brasil reported. Once again, the church said it's goal with the Forest Code petition is to foment public discussion on the proposed bill.","The Senate is considering changes to the country's Forest Code .

"(CNN) -- Licenses were awarded to 20 medical marijuana dispensaries in Massachusetts, the first in the state after a voter-approved law went into effect in 2013, state officials announced Friday. The Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services said 100 finalists applied for licenses and were judged on how they served the public health, their security and strength of their business plans, as well as their focus on the ability to meet patients' needs. ""Health officials designed a rigorous process for vetting applicants,"" said the statement, citing a process that included a selection committee that determined the ability of each applicant to ""meet overall health needs to registered patients while ensuring public safety."" The law went into effect January 1, 2013, and allows the department to register up to 35 nonprofit registered marijuana dispensaries. In addition to the 20 approved, eight other applicants were qualified but the proposed locations were rejected, the statement said. Those applicants will be able to reapply in other counties that do not have a licensed dispensary, according to the department. Patients who have a written certification from a physician for medical marijuana will be registered in an online system, according to the department. Medical marijuana dispensaries serve clients who suffer ills ranging from cancer to AIDS to chronic pain. Proponents say the drug's pain-relieving properties offer an alternative for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Eighteen states have either decriminalized or allowed medical marijuana in some fashion. While the state laws have allowed dispensaries to open, they remain illegal under federal law. Fourteen states allow dispensaries, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.","Massachusetts grants licenses for 20 medical marijuana dispensaries .

"(CNN) -- A late goal by Robert Lewandowski earned Borussia Dortmund a precious 2-1 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in the Champions League Group F match on Tuesday night. The Polish striker's assured 82nd minute strike gave last year's beaten finalists a vital win, bringing them level on six points with both Arsenal and Napoli who also won on Tuesday beating Marseille 2-1. Dortmund started brightly and took the lead in the 16th minute when Marco Reus nicked the ball off Aaron Ramsey on the edge of the Arsenal penalty area before feeding the ball to Henrikh Mkhitaryan. The Armenian midfielder made no mistake with his shot firing past a helpless Wojciech SzczÄ™sny. Arsenal search for an equalizer was in vain until Tomas Rosicky went close in the 38th minute -- his 18-yard shot being cleared off the line. The excitement fired the home side into life and two minutes later Olivier Giroud had Arsene Wenger's men on level terms. Bacary Sagna's teasing cross from the right saw Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller fumble the ball which then fell kindly for Giroud who slammed home unopposed from close range. The team's remained deadlocked in the second half until Lewandowski expertly guided Kevin GrossKreutz cross past SzczÄ™sny to snatch all three points for the Bundesliga side.

Andre Ayew's scored a late goal for the home side but it was too little too late. Marseille remain pointless at the bottom of the table. In Group E, Chelsea moved top on goal difference after a convincing 3-0 win over Schalke. Fernando Torres opened the scoring with a header in the fifth minute before bagging a second in the 69th minute. Eden Hazard's 87th minute strike rounded off a satisfactory evening for Jose Mourinho. Steaua Bucharest picked up their first Group E point thanks to a late equalizer from Leandro Tatu after Marcelo Diaz had put Basel ahead in the 48th minute. Atletico Madrid stay top of Group G after a comfortable 3-0 win against FK Austria Wien. First half goals from Raul Garcia and Diego Costa saw the away side assume control of the tie before Costa added another in the 53rd minute. With three wins from three, Atletico look odds on to win the group. Zenit St Petersburg are currently lying second with four points after beating Porto 1-0. Barcelona remain top of Group H after a 1-1 draw against Milan at the San Siro. Robinho put the home side in front in the ninth minute following a neat one-two with Kaka before Lionel Messi leveled things up in the 23rd minute with a low shot past Milan keeper Marco Amelia. Barcelona now have seven points to Milan's five while Celtic now have three points after recording a 2-1 win over Ajax at Celtic Park. A penalty from James Forrest got the Celtic faithful rocking at the end of the first half before Beram Kayal doubled the lead nine minutes into the second half. Lasse Schone scored a late consolation goal for the Dutch champions but the defeat sends them to the bottom of the group with just one point from three games.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- She used to lunch at the exclusive Four Seasons. Now, the best-selling author jokes that she's inviting friends to Taco Bell. Call it gallows humor, but Alexandra Penney has just lost her life's savings. Author and artist Alexandra Penney says she lost her life savings investing with financier Bernard Madoff. She invested every penny with accused Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff. Penney thought she had weathered the bear market just fine, since Madoff put her money in super-safe Treasuries. Then, on December 11, she received a call from her best friend. ""She said, 'I hope this is a rumor, but I've just heard Bernie Madoff's been arrested,' "" Penney recalls. ""My other phone rang; it was my son. And he said, 'Mom, sit down.' He said, 'Bernie Madoff's been arrested.' And I said, 'For what?' And he said, 'He's a crook.' "" Madoff's alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme disrupted a fragile financial system, affecting hedge funds and well-heeled investors on Wall Street, Florida and Europe. In a Ponzi scheme, money from new investors is used to pay off early investors to create the appearance of legitimate returns. Conservative with her money, Penney says she has been working and saving since she was a teenager. She admits that her biggest fear was losing everything and ""becoming a bag lady."" About a decade ago, when Penney was in her late 40s, she shared her fears with a good friend, who steered her to Madoff, where she thought her money would always be safe. Watch Penney call Madoff 'loathesome' » . Best known for the 1982 best-seller ""How to Make Love to a Man"" and as a former editor of Self magazine, Penney and her friend Evelyn Lauder were the first to use pink ribbons as a symbol for breast cancer awareness. Every success along the way meant more money, which was eventually invested with Madoff. She earned so much money that she was no longer writing and editing but living her dream as an artist. Sitting in her artist's studio in the SoHo area of New York, she recently said she will start writing again to pay the bills. And she has a few choice words about Madoff, who remains under house arrest in his Manhattan penthouse apartment, where he lives with his wife while the case proceeds. ""Repulsive is mild. Loathsome. It's a visceral feeling. This is not humanity; this is not a human being. This is, again, it's a sociopath,"" Penney says. ""I'm sincerely, and this is the understatement of the year, appalled that this man is not in prison."" But that could change soon if a judge decides to revoke Madoff's bail. In a court filing Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department accused Madoff of having signed about 100 checks -- worth a total of $173 million -- that were ""ready to be sent out"" before his arrest by the FBI on December 11 on a charge of securities fraud.  Madoff investors might have to cough up withdrawals » . Prosecutors said the checks violate his $10 million bail agreement and said it was an attempt to prevent his alleged victims from recovering their losses. If convicted of the charges against him, Madoff, 70, could spend up to 20 years in prison and face a $5 million fine. On the advice of her lawyers, Penney is not saying how much money she lost. She's not penniless, she says. She has a checking account that will last a few months, a West Palm Beach cottage, a Manhattan apartment and a ""beach shack"" in Wainscott, Long Island. Over the past 40 years, she earned and paid for all of it herself. Penney is not asking anyone to feel sorry for her, especially after the acid-response to her first-hand account of her financial woes in a blog called ""The Bag Lady Papers"" on TheDailyBeast.com. In the blog, she talks about selling the cottage and possibly more real estate and taking her first subway ride in 30 years. She's even considered selling some of her expensive jewelry to pay the bills. Some readers blasted her as a privileged New York princess. They told her to get a job. Others said they didn't feel sorry for her. Penney says she was surprised by the ""vitriol."" ""I've never been given a dollar. I never took alimony. I never inherited any money. So, sure, well, who else earned it? Me,"" Penney says. Today, she says she has been ""Madoffed."" When the phone rang last month with the news about Madoff's arrest, Penney was making a cheese soufflé. Ever the writer, she uses the soufflé as a metaphor. ""Everything was rising. We were all rising. The housing market was rising. Bernie Madoff's money, people like me, my money was making 9, 10 percent,"" Penney says. ""There was this incredible lift of the economic picture. And I think that the crash of the stock market and the crash of Bernie Madoff together are really emblematic that the system is the culprit. Madoff is emblematic of the system, but there's something very wrong with the system."" And just like the investments, Penney says, the soufflé fell, too.","Best-selling author Alexandra Penney lost life savings in alleged fraud scheme .

"(CNN) -- Democracy campaigners in Bahrain and politicians around the world are calling for this Sunday's Formula 1 race in the Gulf state to be canceled as violent clashes continue between activists and authorities. What are the issues around the controversy, and how are the sport and its fans reacting? Why are there calls for this weekend's Grand Prix in Bahrain to be scrapped? Opposition groups in Bahrain as well as politicians, rights groups and many F1 fans around the world want Sunday's Grand Prix -- which could be watched by a global audience of more than 500 million -- to be canceled while the Gulf state braces itself for more violent demonstrations after months of political unrest. Protesters see the race as a publicity stunt by the country's rulers to make the nation seem more unified than it actually is. The Bahrain Grand Prix was canceled last year amid a Shiite-led uprising against the Sunni monarchy and a government crackdown in which dozens were killed and hundreds detained. Nabeel Rajab, an opposition protester, said the demonstrators were not against the Formula One race itself. ""We are just against the government or the oppressive ruling elite using that as PR,"" Rajab said. In Britain, where many F1 teams are based, opposition leader Ed Miliband said: ""Sport and politics generally shouldn't mix, but ... what kind of signal does it send to the world when this grand prix is going ahead, given the concerns there are, given the violence we have seen in Bahrain, given the continuing issues around human rights? ""I don't think it's the right decision to let this grand prix go ahead and I think the government needs to weigh in and express its view."" And opposition politician Yvette Cooper urged British F1 stars Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton to pull out of the race. ""It shouldn't go ahead, I don't think British drivers should go. I think the Formula 1 should not go ahead in Bahrain,"" Cooper told the BBC. But UK Prime Minister David Cameron refused to join the calls, insisting it was a matter for the F1 authorities whether the race went ahead. ""It is important that peaceful protests are allowed to go ahead,"" he said. Why are protests now taking place in Bahrain? Shiite opposition groups in the Sunni-ruled kingdom say they want equality, and have posted calls on social networking sites for daily protests during the Grand Prix weekend, to focus media attention on their demands. The government has sought to ban protests in the capital Manama but that has failed to prevent violent clashes in the capital between demonstrators and authorities, who are accused of heavy-handed tactics. The government has condemned violence on all sides -- saying that any police officers found guilty of heavy-handed tactics would be held to account and that protesters should behave in a civil manner as well. An Amnesty International report this week says promised reforms in Bahrain are inadequate and fail to provide justice for victims of human rights violations. Protesters are also demanding the release of jailed activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who has been on hunger strike for more than 70 days. Al-Khawaja, 52, was arrested in April 2011 for his role in anti-government protests that began a month earlier with demands for political reform and greater freedoms for Shiites. In June, Bahrain found him and seven other Shiite opposition activists guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's royal family. The government also stands accused of punishing its own national sporting heroes and accusing them of being traitors. International and local human rights groups say three players in the Bahraini national soccer squad were arrested last year, along with more than 150 sportsmen, women and administrators. It is unclear how many remain in jail. The authorities maintain they were part of illegal, violent protests. Could protesters disrupt the race or threaten spectators? This is the big question. Protesters have vowed to protest near the Sakhir circuit, which is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from Manama, but witnesses there say there is a heavy police presence on the road between the track and the airport. The unrest makes hosting the race precarious because the racers must pass through some areas where clashes have occurred to get to the circuit, which is in the desert. On Thursday protesters burned tyres, briefly blocking several main roads leading to Sakhir. A Molotov cocktail exploded late Wednesday near a car carrying members of one F1 team, Force India, during clashes between protesters and security forces. No one was reported injured in the incident. The incident prompted a team member and a contractor to return home despite reassurances by officials that Bahrain is safe. Bahrain has refused to extend visas of non-sports reporting crews from CNN and other news organizations, saying they cannot stay for the race. What do F1 drivers and the sport's governing body say? Formula One's governing body, the FIA, decided last week the race should go ahead, after weeks of speculation. The governing body said its president traveled to Bahrain in November and met ""decision-makers and opinion formers, including elected Shiite members of parliament. All expressed their wish for the Grand Prix to go ahead in 2012,"" it said. Drivers have attempted to distance themselves from the violence. Romain Grosjean of France-based Team Lotus said his team was preparing for the event ""as well as we can."" ""As you say, we can't ignore the situation. But in another way, I hope the race may make a clear vision and help the situation and I think the Grand Prix will be nice,"" he told reporters in Bahrain. Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel brushed off any concerns about safety, saying: ""I heard about the issue at Force India. ""Generally in the paddock (staging area for the cars) it seems to be no problem,"" he told the Press Association. ""Outside of the paddock maybe there is a risk, but I think there is a risk everywhere we go."" Seven-times title winner Michael Schumacher initially insisted he did not want to get involved before saying: ""I just want to say one thing which is I don't want to mix the sport with politics. I'm here for the sport."" How much is the race worth to Bahrain and to F1 itself? Bahrain pays $64 million to host the Grand Prix but the island kingdom it is estimated to receive several times that amount -- up to $800 million -- from tourism and other economic benefits. Of more importance is the issue of prestige that the race could bring. ""Bahrain is no different from the other Persian Gulf states in using high profile sporting events like tennis and golf tournaments to raise their own international prestige,"" James Montague, a journalist who has written about sport in the Middle East and is the author of ""When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone,"" told CNN. ""Qatar winning the bid to host the 2022 World Cup finals is a case in point. The F1 grand prix has been instrumental in raising Bahrain's international profile far higher than a small island with a population of around 1 million people could expect. ""The idea that sport and politics should be separated is worse than a myth. It's disingenuous. The royal family of Bahrain secured the F1 GP with wider economic and political aims in mind. They are even promoting the race within Bahrain as a potentially unifying force for the kingdom. They say that politics has no role in sport but separating sport from the political realities of any society is as impossible as separating politics and art, or music."" Have there been protests against F1 races held in other countries accused of human rights abuses? No. Last week's race in China took place without any calls for it to be cancelled despite concerns about human rights in that country. The same could be said for races in Russia and Singapore. The only serious protests in the history of Formula One -- a multi-billion dollar sport and industry -- were before the South Africa Grand Prix at Kayalami in 1985 against the apartheid regime. Despite a boycott of South African teams in other leading sports at the time, the event still took place, but was cancelled the following year and only resumed in 1992. How have F1 fans reacted? Many fans of the sport have reacted with disgust, with countless posts on Twitter saying that they would refuse to even watch the race on television in protest. Ed Foster, a writer for British magazine Motorsport, told CNN: ""We did a poll on our website recently and the response was instant. We simply wrote 'Should F1 go to Bahrain? Yes or no?' and hundreds of people got back to us straight away. ""I think only one said that we should. It's pretty clear speaking to people that a lot of the fans have decided to not watch the race out of principle."" It remains unclear how F1 fans will react to calls to boycott the race -- either at the track or watching on TV. But one news agency, the UK's Press Association, reported there were few spectators in the main grandstand at Sakhir to watch Friday's practice session.","Democracy campaigners in Bahrain want Sunday's F1 race in the Gulf state to be canceled .

"(CNN) -- Syria's opposition says the once-bustling commercial capital of Aleppo might soon fall victim to a crushing siege if government troop advances continue unabated. Fears of encirclement rose after the Syrian army, backed by pro-government militias, wrested control of the Sheikh Najjar neighborhood and the nearby village of Kafr Saghir, a strategic industrial area at the northeastern entrance to Aleppo city. Government troops also advanced toward central Aleppo from the western suburbs, most of which it controls, including the Hamdaniya district along the key Damascus-Aleppo Highway. Rebels called the defeats a strategic withdrawal and announced the formation of a 600-strong elite force to combat the escalating offensive, the opposition-run Aleppo Media Center reported. The Syrian military is focused on capturing the Handaraat settlement, which links the opposition-controlled neighborhoods of Aleppo city with the Turkish border. If successful, the Syrian government will be in a position to besiege an estimated 300,000 civilians and isolate fighters from a vital supply line, the Aleppo Provincial Council tells CNN. ""The rebels are fortifying themselves on the edge of the city"" Mohammed Wisam, a spokesman for the Aleppo Media Center told CNN, ""but residents fear a siege."" Fighters from the National Defense Forces, a Syrian paramilitary group, and the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah arrived in Aleppo ahead of what activists believe will be a full-scale assault on Handaraat. ""This will be the route to death,"" Abdul Rahman Dadam, head of Aleppo's Provincial Council, tells CNN, ""The humanitarian crisis will be huge, and the civilians will pay the price."" The United States accuses Syria of a ""kneel or starve"" tactic on areas that turned against the government of President Bashar al-Assad during the country's more than three-year uprising turned civil war. A nearly two-year encirclement of the Old District of Homs drew widespread international condemnation earlier this year when activists reported hungry families were forced to pick grass for food, and in the still besieged Damascus suburbs, dozens have died because of a lack of basic medical supplies and food, doctors inside Syria told CNN earlier this year. Radical threat to the west . An altogether different threat faces rebels in the western Aleppo countryside, where the ultraradical Islamic State of Iraq and Syria controls three main cities, including a key position in Jarabalus along the Turkish border. The group recently launched an offensive on much of the Kurdish eastern countryside of Aleppo after announcing the creation of a so-called ""Islamic State"" stretching from central Syria to Falluja, Iraq, with the head of the group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as the self-styled Caliph. Militants captured three Kurdish villages in Aleppo province near the ethnic minority's stronghold of Ayn al-Arab this week, according to the London-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The People's Protection Unit, a Kurdish militia, evacuated about 2,000 civilians from the area and clashed with ISIS on Tuesday in an attempt to recapture the villages. At least three elderly civilians who refused to leave their homes were captured and executed by ISIS, the observatory and Kurdish activists reported. ""The whole area has been turned into a battle ground, but the people have no choice. They must stay strong, and we must defend ourselves,"" Omar Alloush, the head of external relations in the local branch of the Democratic Union Party, which administers Ayn al-Arab, told CNN. After ISIS captured tanks and American Humvees in a sweeping campaign on the Sunni heartland of Iraq, the group intensified its march on Kurdish and rebel-held parts of Aleppo province in Syria, multiple activists tell CNN. ""We do not want anything from ISIS; we just want them to not come into our areas and impose their rule. We do not want their caliphate,"" Alloush said. The intensification of fighting stalled talks for the release of more than a 120 Kurdish students kidnapped in May by ISIS and forced to take daily classes in ultraradical Islamic theology. The families of the abducted ninth grades say their children are being brainwashed and have appealed to the international community for help. ""I still have hope the children will be released. We remain steadfast, and we ask ISIS to call a cease-fire for just 24 hours so we can find a way to return the students to their families,"" Alloush said. Who is the ISIS? Constant aerial bombardment . For civilians, the skies are the third and arguably the most threatening front in the battle for Aleppo. ""Fear God!"" an elderly women yells on a social media post after her neighborhood of Tariq al Bab was barrel-bombed by government warplanes, ""They have destroyed our homes and killed our children."" The Syrian army appears to have escalated the use of barrel bombs, crudely constructed weapons packed with explosives and dropped indiscriminately, on Aleppo since the launch of the ground offensive last week, activists tell CNN. ""Where in the world is it OK to drop hundreds of kilos of explosives from thousands of meters in the sky on a densely populated civilian area?"" Dadam tells CNN. ""The international community must stop the killing."" Syria's protracted civil war has claimed the lives of at least 140,000 people, including hundreds killed by barrel bombs, human rights groups report. Thousands more fled what the opposition dubs the ""barrels of death"" to join the more 2.9 million refugees struggling to survive in neighboring countries. ""The regime is fighting us with rockets and bombs from the sky and ISIS is firing mortar and tank shells on the ground. How can the revolution stand up to all this? Dadam tells CNN. ""This is why we need the international community to intervene. To stop the bloodshed."" How ISIS is overshadowing al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- The emergence of a purported statement from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden about U.S. policy in Pakistan as the U.S. president embarks on a major trip to Muslim countries is no coincidence, the White House spokesman and a counterterrorism official say. Osama bin Laden is seen in an image taken from a videotape that aired on Al-Jazeera in September 2003. ""I think the reports we've seen are consistent with messages we've seen in the past from al Qaeda threatening the U.S. and other countries that are involved in counter-terrorism efforts,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters Wednesday. ""But I don't think it's surprising that al Qaeda would want to shift attention away from the president's historic efforts and continued efforts to reach out and have an open dialogue with the Muslim world."" A U.S. counterterrorism official, asked about the statement, said bin Laden ""has timed the release of tapes to major events so it is not surprising that he picked this particular week."" Al Jazeera, the Arabic-language TV network that aired the message on Wednesday, said the statement was ""a voice recording by bin Laden."" As for the tape's authenticity, a CNN analysis said the voice does indeed sound like the leader of the terrorist network that attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. The counterterrorism official said ""there has never been a fake Bin Laden tape."" The message comes as Obama begins his trip to the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and, in Egypt on Thursday, making a major speech to the Muslim world. Zeroing in on the conflict in Pakistan's Swat Valley, where Pakistan's troops are taking on Taliban militants, the message asserts that Obama is proving that he is ""walking the same road of his predecessors to build enmity against Muslims and increasing the number of fighters, and establishing more lasting wars."" The message said U.S. policy in Pakistan has generated ""new seeds of hatred and revenge against America."" The remarks -- which would be bin Laden's first assessment of Obama's policy -- were believed to have been recorded several weeks ago at the start of a mass civilian exodus because of fighting in northwestern Pakistan. The speaker cites strikes, destruction, and Obama's ""order"" to Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari ""to prevent the people of Swat from implementing sharia law."" ""All this led to the displacement of about a million Muslim elders, women and children from their villages and homes. They became refugees in tents after they were honored in their own homes,"" the message says. ""This basically means that Obama and his administration put new seeds of hatred and revenge against America. The number of these seeds is the same as the number of those victims and refugees in Swat and the tribal area in northern and southern Waziristan."" And, the message says, ""the American people need to prepare to only gain what those seeds bring up.""  Watch what the speaker says on the tape » . The speaker also says Zardari and Pakistan's military chief, Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, continue to divert the army's main role from protecting the nation to fighting Islam and its followers. He says the war is also hurting Pakistan's economy, endangering the country's religion and security and ""fulfilling an American, Jewish and Indian plot."" ""Most of the Pakistani people reject this unjust war. Zardari did this in response to the ones paying him in the White House -- not 10 percent but multiple folds of that,"" the message says. The message points to India's aspirations, saying it is ""easy for India to subject the disassembled territories of Pakistan, one after another, for its own benefit, like the case of eastern Pakistan before, or even worse."" ""This way, America eases its worry towards Pakistan's nuclear weapons,"" the message says. Eastern Pakistan is a reference to Bangladesh, which had been part of Pakistan until it became an independent country in 1971. Pakistan and India have also been at odds over the disputed territory of Kashmir, and pro-bin Laden jihadis have opposed Indian rule there. Richard Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special envoy to Pakistan and India, said he hadn't listened to the message but commented on what he had heard about it. ""The idea that anyone is responsible for the refugee crisis other than al Qaeda and the Taliban and the other people who have caused such tragedy in western Pakistan is ludicrous,"" he said. ""This entire problem begins with al Qaeda and its associates, and everybody in the world knows that, and it's silly to even respond to such a ludicrous charge."" Al Jazeera aired three separate segments totaling just over four minutes long from what it said is a new bin Laden audiotape aired over an old still picture of the terrorist leader. The network's anchors took part in describing each of the segments before they ran them. Since the message was not posted on the radical Islamist Web sites that usually carry statements from al Qaeda, it is believed that this latest message was hand-delivered to the TV network, based in Doha, Qatar. In other purported bin Laden messages issued in March, he called for Somalia's new president to be overthrown and called Israel's recent offensive in Gaza a ""holocaust."" Bin Laden has delivered many messages over the years, but the last video message from him was in early September 2007. In that video message, he criticized U.S. Democrats for failing to stop the war in Iraq; spoke of the anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II; the troop surge in Iraq; and world leaders such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. On that tape, bin Laden's appearance was artificially changed for the first time. He dyed his beard from grayish white to black, leading analysts to believe that he has switched to sending only audio messages because he is altering his looks and doesn't want people to know what he looks like. Analysts also believe that bin Laden hasn't made videos lately because they are more labor-intensive to produce. There have been gaps between videos from bin Laden, with many audio messages in between, each time prompting analysts to theorize he might be dead. The last two videos of bin Laden himself delivering an address were the 2007 tape and another in 2004.  See a timeline of bin Laden messages » . The U.S. counterterrorism official said of the latest purported bin Laden tape that ""while the words are different"" from other messages, this statement ""recycles the broad themes of messages past."" ""While we are still looking at the message closely, there is no reason to believe any specific or credible threat is contained in it,"" the official said. Al Qaeda's second in command issued an audio statement Tuesday saying Obama is not welcome in Egypt. Ayman al-Zawahiri said relations with the United States cannot be mended so long as the administration maintains its alliance with Israel. In a message called ""Tyrants of Egypt and America's agents welcome Obama"" that was posted on Islamist Web sites, al-Zawahiri once again lashed out at the United States. Obama's message to the Muslim world, he said, has already been delivered with his support for ""Zionist aggression."" In the 10-minute audio message, al-Zawahiri said Obama had already made himself an enemy of Muslims by sending more soldiers to Afghanistan, ordering bombings in the tribal areas of Pakistan and administering a ""bloody campaign against Muslims"" in Pakistan's Swat Valley.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- On an island off the coast of the Chinese city of Shanghai, architects, engineers and contractors are preparing to build a new city later this year. In itself, this is nothing special one would think. Dongtan, the eco-city being built off the coast of Shanghai on the Yangtze River. With 20 percent of the world population living in China and national population figures set to hit 1.47 billion by 2020, there is always demand for new housing. But the city that is to be built on Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River is like no other in the world: Dongtan eco-city is planned to be first truly environmentally and economically sustainable city. Situated on a plot of land that is around two-thirds the size of Manhattan, Dongtan is surrounded by wetlands and lies beside a bird sanctuary where hundreds of rare migratory birds seek refuge. It was these unusual natural conditions that sparked the ambitious idea of creating a new urban concept for an entirely sustainable city that would minimally impact the surrounding environment. Planning started in 2005, after the London-based engineering and design firm Arup signed a contract with the Shanghai Industrial Investment Corporation (SIIC). ""We were asked to create an 'eco-demonstrator',"" explains Roger Wood, Arup's project coordinator for the Dongtan project since 2004, ""a project that incorporated a number of ideas and design concepts that would increase the Chinese understanding of sustainability. ""China has known about sustainability for 20 years, but -- like everyone else -- it has just not been able to apply it as a concept."" The project is to be implemented in several phases, starting with a one square-kilometer plot that is expected to be ready in time for Shanghai's 2010 World Expo and that will house around 5,000 people. The 6.5 square kilometer start-up area will be developed to accommodate 80,000 people by 2020 and by 2050, the city is projected to cover an area of 30 square kilometers and have a population of half a million. Building a community spirit . Today the site is still isolated from the mainland, but the opening of a bridge and tunnel link in 2008 will reduce travel times to and from the island from over three hours to just one hour. Dongtan is however not to be just another dormitory town from which people commute to Shanghai: the new city will provide jobs to its inhabitants. ""It is what we call integrated urbanism: we look not just at the environment, but also at social and economic aspects: employment opportunities, the way people work, the way people play, the way they move around the city,"" says Wood. At the same time, the project also deals with technical aspects like how to provide a sustainable water supply, how to treat wastewater, how to recycle and process waste and how to reduce the use of cars, by concentrating activities around three ""village entrees"" and encouraging people to walk, use bikes or public transport. ""The important thing is that we are not restricting people; we are trying to encourage them to think about the way they live. Questions like: how much electricity do you use and what type of electricity?"" says Wood, adding that cars in Dongtan will run on hydro-fuel or electricity, thus reducing noise and improving air quality. But what will daily life in Dongtan be like? Wood describes a typical day, in which people can walk their children to school, head on to work, easily meet their partners and friends for lunch and enjoy the many green spaces. At the same time people will also be more aware of their impact on the environment. They will get electricity from wind turbines and they will be able to monitor their energy and water use in the home. ""The project is very much about creating a community,"" says Wood. ""Community is very important and it is something the Chinese are very good at now, but which may disappear with the current explosive growth of cities."" Visionary concept . Despite all the new technologies and sustainable concepts, Dongtan will remain a recognizably Chinese city. After studying the site and its history and looking at the elements that make up the traditional Chinese city, designers came up with ways to give Dongtan a Chinese feel. ""There are lots of water spaces and bridges with what the Chinese call 'dreamy pools'. It is a city that is close to nature and that helps people understand nature,"" says Wood. Using ideas from Dongtan, Arup is today working on the development of master plans for three other eco-cities in China and also master plans for cities in Russia, Britain and Saudi Arabia. ""The key of the Dongtan concept is that all elements are considered. And in principle this can be applied anywhere else in the world. But it does take a visionary to make the project viable; a project like that is not just business as usual. ""It is more complex, because the economic viability is just as important as sustainability. A city can't be sustainable if it is not economically viable,"" says Wood. Thus, starting on a modest one-square kilometer plot at the mouth of Yangtze River, a group of visionaries is perhaps revolutionizing the way we will live in and think about cities around the world. .............................................

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Gunmen killed a Somali lawmaker Tuesday, witnesses and officials said, the second assassination of a member of parliament in Mogadishu in less than 24 hours. Abdurasaq Mohamud, a local police officer, said that militants armed with pistols intercepted Abdulaziz Isaak Mursal as he was on his way to work from his home in Mogadishu's Dharkenley neighborhood. The attackers' vehicle stopped Mursal's car, and two gunmen got out and opened fire. The gunmen fled and Somali security forces cordoned off the area, but the assailants escaped unharmed, Mohamud said. Abdi Mohamed, a colleague of the deceased lawmaker, said Mursal was rushed to Medina hospital nearby, but doctors were unable to save him. In a statement posted to the Internet, the Islamist rebel group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for Mursal's assassination and said its fighters have vowed to kill Somali officials and target foreign governments that support Somalia's government. Somali Prime Minister Abdiwali Sheikh Ahmed condemned the violence. ""These acts of terror only serve to inflict indiscriminate violence, distress and grief on innocent people. Taking a human life is abhorrent, and these terrorists have destroyed an innocent family and stricken them with grief,"" he said in a statement issued Tuesday. On Monday, another Somali lawmaker was killed and another injured when a bomb hidden in their car exploded while they were headed to a security conference, officials said. Parliamentarian Isack Mohamed Ali, popularly known as Isack Rino, was killed, and lawmaker Mohamud Abdi-dhuuh was seriously injured, said Mohamed Abdiqadir Mohamed, district commissioner of Mogadishu's Hamarweyne district. Al-Shabaab also claimed responsibility for Monday's bombing in a statement posted to a pro-militant website. Ahmed said the two attacks were ""deplorable,"" and ""the use of terror will not derail us from the progress made in securing Somalia."" Journalists Mohamed Sheikh Nor and Abdulkadir Fooday reported from Mogadishu; CNN's Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Rising from the desert like a space-age skyscraper, there is something equally awe-inspiring and unnerving about the five-star Meydan Hotel. At night, the sleek glass building glows green and purple, its distinctive crescent roof looming high above the manicured race track below. It's an opulent and eerily futuristic setting befitting the richest horse race on the planet -- the Dubai World Cup, which kicks off this weekend. With more than $27 million in prize money on offer over the 11-day carnival, it's little wonder the world's greatest race horses, and their influential entourage, flock every year to the United Arab Emirates. But can the grand architectural statements and megabucks compete with the prestige of centuries-old races like the Kentucky and Epsom Derby? The country's ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, seems to think it can, and he's willing to dig into his deep pockets to ensure Dubai is very much on the international horse racing map. ""Prestige has to do with the tradition and culture of the region,"" said chief executive of the Dubai World Cup Frank Gabriel. ""We're 17-years-old, so we're still very young."" ""You can have a prestigious race, but you can also have the very best race horses in the world -- which is what we have."" Gulf's sporting muscle . Launched in 1996, the Dubai World Cup is a relatively new player on the horse racing circuit, and carving out a name as an internationally renowned competition has taken huge investment. While the U.S. and Europe battle against austerity measures, the Gulf's wealthy horse-mad sheikhs are pumping billions of dollars into boosting the region's racing status. ""Throughout my career, Sheik Mohammed has been the most influential man in the horse racing world,"" said American Dale Romans, who last year won the award for most outstanding trainer in the U.S. ""He breeds thoroughbreds, he buys them, he competes them -- he does everything. He has very deep pockets in the game and he's willing to spread the wealth around."" It's part of a larger campaign by the oil-rich Gulf to become a premier sporting destination -- and not just for horses. Qatar will be the first Arab state to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022, while investors across the region continue to buy up European football teams. Among the big players are the Qatar Investment Authority, which owns France's Paris Saint-Germain, and Kuwaiti businessman Fawaz Al Hasawi, who last year bought English club Nottingham Forest. Cutting-edge course . Back on home turf in the UAE, the $1 billion Meydan Racecourse -- headquarters of the Dubai World Cup -- is the glittering crown in Sheik Mohammed's racing empire. The grandstand alone is 1.6 kilometers long, while the site boasts a 285-room luxury hotel with roof-top pool, a marina, racing museum, and IMAX theatre. ""It's over-the-top, it's just gorgeous, everything about it is first class,"" Romans said of the Meydan Hotel where he is staying before competing in Saturday's race. ""It's almost futuristic -- everything is brand new and spotless with shiny glass and metal."" The high-tech course, which champion Italian jockey Frankie Dettori famously described as ""like a spaceship from 'Star Wars,"" is worlds apart from the classic southern charm of the Kentucky Derby's Churchill Downs. ""You can't buy history,"" said Romans, who won the Dubai Cup in 2005. ""You don't have that deep sense of tradition here that you have at the Kentucky Derby."" History of horses . The Middle East's racing circuit may still be forging a name for itself, but the region's passion for horses is centuries old. The thoroughbred we know today dates back to three Arab horses brought to Britain around the turn of the 17th century. ""The horse is a very significant part of people's lives here,"" Gabriel said. ""People love the sport and they love the culture -- it's about the beauty of the horse."" Eyes on the prize . Dubai's record prize money, field of world-class horses and impressive backdrop will ensure that the eyes of the world are watching this Saturday. ""When I won in 2005 it absolutely changed my career,"" said Romans. ""I went home from Dubai on a different level -- people looked at me differently."" ""I had proved I could win on an international stage and I was given better horses to train."" And with $10 million up for grabs in the flagship race, there are still many things money can buy.","Dubai World Cup, world's richest race, kicks off this weekend .

"(CNN) -- From the Epic of Gilgamesh, composed in Mesopotamia 4,000 years ago, to Evan Almighty -- Hollywood's 2007 take on the Noah's Ark story -- floods and their catastrophic effects have long provided inspiration for storytellers. As global warming provokes increasingly severe weather events, however, the gap between art and life is fast narrowing, with apocalyptic flooding scenarios now as common in reality as in the imaginations of Hollywood scriptwriters. Recent flooding in the UK, for example -- the worst for 60 years -- left some 30,000 people homeless and the insurance industry facing over £3 billion ($6 billion) in payouts. Torrential rains in India, Nepal and Bangladesh have caused even greater misery, claiming hundreds of lives and displacing an estimated 20 million civilians. In the U.S., meanwhile, New Orleans continues to suffer from the ravages of 2005's Hurricaine Katrina, with much of the city still empty and uninhabitable two years after the deluge. With low-lying areas around the world increasingly susceptible to flooding -- this at a time when population growth has necessitated the construction of more and more homes in such areas -- the question of how to balance the need for housing with the dangers of rising water levels has never been more pressing. In the Netherlands, where half the country lies below mean sea level and flooding has long been a fact of life, construction and engineering company Dura Vermeer has come up with a novel and, when you think about it, obvious solution to the problem: houses that float. ""These type of homes offer a good way of dealing with the effects of climate change,"" Dura Vermeer spokesman Johan van der Pol told CNN. ""Unlike normal houses, they are extremely flexible when it comes to flooding, able to deal with a sea level rise of up to five metres. ""In a country such as Holland, where flooding is a serious problem, this sort of technology could have an extremely important role to play."" The company has developed two variations on the same theme: a floating house which, as the name suggests, sits permanently on the water like a boat; and an amphibious house that stands on dry land but, in the event of floods, is able to rise with the water. Both employ a large hollow concrete cube at their base to provide buoyancy, and are ""moored"" in pairs to huge steel piles to keep them anchored in one place, the piles enabling them to withstand currents as strong as you would find on the open seas. Water and electricity are brought in through flexible pipes that have been adapted to bend and move with the swell of the water. In every other respect they look and feel like normal homes -- albeit up-market designer homes -- with split-level accommodation, wooden balconies and clapboard exteriors painted cheery shades of yellow, green and blue. ""The steel piles mean that residents experience no horizontal, side-to-side movement,"" explains van der Pol. ""Although there is a small amount of vertical, up and down movement, most residents say they find the feeling quite enjoyable. ""These houses not only offer protection against floods, but also great quality of living and low environmental impact."" So far Dura Vermeer has built 46 such water-friendly units - 14 floating and 32 amphibious - at Maasbommel, on the banks of the River Maas in Gelderland province in the centre of the country. The technology and design -- the latter provided by Dutch architectural firm Factor Architecten -- took three years to develop, although obtaining a government green light for the project took considerably longer. ""After the disastrous floods of 1995 the Dutch government laid down strict rules forbidding the building of houses beside rivers. ""We had a lot of discussion with them and eventually those rules were adapted to allow for the construction of suitable housing at fifteen separate river locations, of which Maasbommel is one. ""Our philosophy is that you can look at water as a threat, but also as a challenge and a commercial opportunity. Combining water and housing is the obvious way forward in countries such as the Netherlands."" Floating buildings are certainly not the only way of achieving such a combination. Dura Vermeer is also developing what they term ""dry-proof"" and ""wet-proof"" houses, the former designed to prevent water intrusion, the latter to actually allow it. ""The idea with wet-proof houses is that all the essential rooms -- living room, kitchen, bedroom - are on the upper floors,"" explains van der Pol. ""In the event of a flood you open the doors and allow the water to enter the non-essential lower rooms, which have been specially designed to resist water damage, with waterproof plaster and specially adapted electrics and plumbing. ""It is how houses in Holland always used to be built."" If there are a number of technological options, however, it is the idea of a floating house, one that can withstand rising water levels by literally rising with them, that has attracted the most interest, both within the Netherlands and from countries with similar flooding issues. ""There have been enquiries from around the world,"" says van der Pol. ""We are now working with companies in the Far East, Asia, America and elsewhere in Europe, although we ourselves will only be building houses in Holland."" The houses are certainly not being touted as an alternative to conventional flood defenses such as dykes, levees and river barriers. Nor are they cheap, their starting price of 260,000 euros ($310,000) meaning that, in terms of mass construction, it is only the world's more affluent nations that will be able to afford them (although as van der Pol points out, developing countries such as Bangladesh tend to use materials other than concrete to build houses, so probably would have much use for these type of structures anyway.) In Europe, the U.S, and Canada, on the other hand, such buildings could well become the norm, with Dura Vermeer and a number of other Dutch companies already exploring the possibility of entire cities built in this manner. With scientists predicting sea-level rises of up to 110 cms (43 inches) by 2100, and catastrophic weather events becoming ever more common, the floating house could be the only realistic way for people to continue living in low-lying areas without fear of losing their homes, possessions and even lives to flooding. As Dutch Housing Minister Sybilla Dekker recently put it: ""You cannot fight water. You have to learn how to live with it."" Or in this case, float on it. ............................................. Are floating houses the answer to rising sea levels? Would you live in a floating home?

"(CNN) -- I'm starting to lose patience. It's not like the guy doesn't understand communication. Actor Ashton Kutcher has 11 million Twitter followers and nearly 13 million Facebook fans. Maybe he just forgot to put a stamp on the letter he should've written to America, saying, ""I'm sorry I painted myself up in brown-face and spoke in a mock Indian accent in order to sell potato chips. I understand the serious impact this has on society, and I'm trying to undo the damage I've caused."" It's been nearly two months since Kutcher's offensive commercial -- disguised as a dating video -- for popchips, a snack food company, appeared on YouTube, showing him as ""Raj,"" a Bollywood producer. (In it, he also plays a hippie, a fashionista and a biker.) And while the ad has been removed, and popchips CEO Keith Belling has issued a predictable ""we did not intend to offend anyone"" apology buried on the company's blog, Kutcher has gotten away scot-free. As the Internet buzzed over the gaffe last month, Kutcher was posting links on how to ""pull out a tooth with a rocket"" and ""80s Cartoon Beats by DJ Tee."" Today, Kutcher's Twitter and Facebook accounts still link to the original popchips video, while the company's website prominently features him as its ""president of pop."" I work at a civil rights organization located two blocks from popchips' San Francisco headquarters. Walking to the office every morning on Montgomery Avenue, I am assaulted by Kutcher's 15-foot tall ads for popchips. Seeing his relaxed, smiling, ""never baked but perfect if you are"" face, I am reminded that the controversy has not scratched his reputation or earning power. Many of you may be thinking, get over it! It was just a joke! Why do you have to take this so seriously? History can tell us why. In 1961, actor Mickey Rooney taped his eyes, wore buckteeth and spoke in a mock Japanese accent in order to take on the role of a bumbling landlord, Mr. Yunioshi, in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" Hilarious? Well, this was just 15 years after the closure of the last of the Japanese American World War II internment camps, which incarcerated 120,000 innocent people of Japanese descent, two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens. Up until the 1960s, white entertainers were still painting their faces black and their lips bright red in order to play the roles of hapless houseboys or eager-to-please mammies. These minstrel shows amused generations of audiences with their grotesque exaggerations of stereotypes and reinforcement of crippling Jim Crow laws, which upheld a separate and very unequal society in the South for nearly a century after the Civil War. Kutcher's brown-face ad comes at a time when South Asian Americans, along with Arab, Middle Eastern and Muslim Americans, have been subjected to more than a decade of post-9/11 racial and religious bullying, profiling and hate crimes. Need I go on? Unfortunately, there is no shortage of examples. But Mr. Kutcher, don't feel helpless, because here's what you can do: . 1. Apologize. Just do it. C'mon, you apologized (and took a Twitter leave of absence!) for lamenting the firing of Penn State coach Joe Paterno. For an example of a truly excellent I-take-responsibility-for-my-actions apology, look to actor Jason Alexander (George Costanza on ""Seinfeld""), who apologized on June 3 for calling cricket a ""gay"" sport two days earlier. 2. Work with people who make you better. You are in the enviable position of being rich and famous, so you have more flexibility than others in choosing whose money you take. Do some research on the companies you work with before accepting their paychecks. Do they advocate the causes you claim to support? 3. Invest in solutions. We may never know the total cost of the damage your popchips ad inflicted on society. But there are ways to curb it. Invest your time and money into educating the public about Indian Americans, Asian Americans and other ethnic groups, and support solutions that promote the equality and dignity of all people. If you can do those three things, I promise you, it won't just be me smiling the next time I walk up Montgomery Street.","Kutcher played Indian movie producer in ad for popchips .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In a world where third spaces -- the places where we spend time away from work and home -- are increasingly privately owned, how can we make our public spaces outstanding? Seattle's Rem Koolhaas-designed Central Library, seen from the corner of Madison Street and Fourth Avenue . Those looking for inspiration might turn to Seattle, whose citizens voted to spend nearly $200 million to create or revamp 27 public libraries, including rebuilding its landmark Central Library. City librarian Deborah L. Jacobs spearheaded the library program. ""Seattle is a city of readers, but our library buildings were getting tired,"" she told CNN. ""They were not working, not big enough, not functional for the change in the way information is being delivered."" Following her appointment in 1997, Jacobs focused on convincing people that investment on a massive scale was needed. She took her proposal to the city's constituents. ""We talked to them honestly, night after night, lunch after lunch, and they voted overwhelmingly to support it,"" she explained. On November 3 1998, Seattle voted to spend $196 million of public money on library buildings, which, coupled with private donations, gave Jacobs the budget she needed. Jacobs and her team are now approaching the end of a project that has created or revitalized 27 libraries across the city. ""By the end of this year, we'll have spent $280 million on new libraries in Seattle,"" she told CNN. The jewel in the crown of Jacobs's project is the Rem Koolhaas-designed Central Library. At 362,000 square feet plus parking, and with 11 floors -- nine of them public -- it's a shining testament to the success of the city's campaign. Glittering spaceport . The Central Library now rises like a glittering spaceport from Madison, Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Inside, the light and airy space is punctuated with bright flashes of color, from its acid-yellow escalators to its pop-art-pink children's center. Its industrial check in/out desks and rows of stainless steel shelves create an ambience that's more high-tech art cafe than stuffy reading room, while light floods in through the glass-and-steel structure, illuminating its users.  See photos of Seattle Central Library » . But it's not just racy looks. The library has been designed as a fully-functional, hard-working public space. It now holds over a million books and the backbone of the collection is its innovative ""Book Spiral"" that displays the entire non-fiction collection in a continuous run, with separate areas for fiction, children's books and a teen section. The library also caters to its users' digital information needs. Jacobs said, ""We had 32 public computers in the old central library. Now we have 300."" And the building is equipped to act as a community hub, too. Jacobs continued, ""We're able to offer space for meetings and programming, space for collections, community gathering spaces and a coffee stand where people can come and meet informally."" The library now hosts workshops, talks and events on everything from Harry Potter to henna painting. ""It's really designed to be flexible but still have a sense of awe,"" she added. ""It's simply, absolutely, perfectly lovely."" Sustainable from the start . The city stipulated that the new Central Library had to have tangible sustainable elements. Jacobs said, ""When we hired the architect, we were very clear that we wanted to incorporate things that would make a difference right now. We wanted to be sustainable right from the start."" So the building, which holds a silver LEED rating, used local and recycled materials where possible in its construction. To reduce its energy consumption, it maximizes daylight and uses automated lighting controls, while the wire mesh in the structure's glass helps conduct heat out of the building, decreasing the need for air conditioning. When Central Library first opened its doors, 28,000 of Seattle's residents were lined up outside to admire their new temple to information. ""More people than ever are using it,"" said Jacobs. The library now has double the daily visitors of the old library. ""Not about the retail"" At a time when we're spending more time at the mall, Jacobs says one of the library's greatest benefits to the community is its role as a non-commercial public space. ""You can be here without having to spend money,"" she told CNN. ""It's not about the retail."" And that's echoed by users of the library, many of whom are near-evangelical about its appeal. Alex Steffen, a Seattle resident and founder of green Web site Worldchanging.com, told CNN, ""I'm very impressed by the library here and the way that people have really taken it on as something of their own."" ""They go to events there, hang out, talk and have coffee. It has seemed to work as one of the centers of community life here in Seattle."" In the future, Deborah L. Jacobs hopes that use of Seattle's libraries will grow. ""I'd like to see people continue to gain a cultural, educational or personal joy,"" she said. ""I'd like to see the hundreds of thousands of children who use our library enter school more ready to learn; I'd like to see people who are afraid of computers learn how to use them. I'd just like to take everything we're doing and do it even better."" And she offers this advice to anyone inspired to start a similar campaign: ""Really make sure that you know what your vision is. Engage people including the staff and the public, and be very clear with your architects. And remember that you have the moral superiority of client, whether you're doing your kitchen or a public building."" ............................

"Washington (CNN) -- It's a highly secured, sophisticated research lab studying deadly diseases such as bird flu, monkeypox, tuberculosis and rabies. It's in a facility called Building 18, which cost taxpayers $214 million. And now, the Biosafety Level 3 lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta is also the subject of a congressional investigation after a potentially dangerous airflow leak at that lab, CNN has learned. The leak occurred on February 16, when air flowed the wrong way out of a germ lab into a clean-air corridor, rather than through the powerful HEPA filter that cleans the air, congressional sources and CDC officials said. Visitors touring the facility were in the clean corridor when they observed a puff of air being pushed out from the lab through a slot in a door window. CNN recommends: Deadly bird flu could become airborne . If experiments had been under way at the time of that air leak, experts say, unprotected visitors could have been exposed to deadly germs, although an epidemic would have been unlikely. According to U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican and a medical doctor, the House Energy and Commerce Committee has asked the CDC for documents about that incident. The request came in the wake of a report on internal CDC e-mails about the incident, first reported by USA Today last week. ""The biggest concern was that there was a contingent of visitors who were walking through the building,"" Burgess said. ""And had one of those people been stricken or made ill or worse, obviously that would have been devastating."" The lab handles small mammals such as rats, ferrets and mice as part of its experiments with pathogens, according to CDC officials. They say animals were in the lab at the time of the air leak, but they were secured in filtered cages. CDC officials say the lab was clean, was not active at the time, and no one got infected. ""At no time during recent incidents featured in the media were CDC workers or the public in harm's way,"" agency spokesman Tom Skinner said. ""This unique facility features multiple security layers specifically designed to protect workers and the public in the event of an incident."" In a statement released to CNN, Burgess' committee said, ""We will actively work to find out if there are additional concerns or incidents associated with Building 18. Any anomaly or breach is of concern, and we will work to ensure the integrity of the facility is maintained and that our scientists are safe."" There has been at least one other safety-related incident in that same building where February's air leak occurred. In 2008, it was discovered that a high-containment lab door was sealed with duct tape. That incident was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and confirmed to CNN by Skinner. Robert Hawley, former safety chief at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, said the CDC has many safety layers in place at its labs. Hawley says researchers at the Biosafety Level 3 lab work in biosafety ""cabinets"" within the lab itself. ""Nothing is handled outside that cabinet,"" Hawley said. ""So they're working with minute amounts of material, and the chances of aerosol are negligible."" But there are questions about a possible cover-up. In an internal e-mail, reported by USA Today, CDC biologist Kismet Scarborough said the centers ""... will do anything ... to hide the fact that we have serious problems with the airflow and containment in this whole building."" CNN has not been able to independently verify that e-mail. But in response, Skinner said, ""CDC will continue to take an open, transparent and inclusive approach to address any safety challenge in a manner that will ensure the safety of our workforce and the public."" Skinner said the agency ""intends to cooperate fully with Rep. Burgess and the committee to address any questions they may have about Building 18 at CDC.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Over the past 20 years, robotics have revolutionized surgery, and new innovations are continuing to push the boundaries of medicine. The ""da Vinci"" system revolutionized keyhole surgery. Mike Rustic, senior lecturer at the mechanical engineering department at Imperial College, London, says machines such as the ""da Vinci"" system have had a huge impact on surgery. The ""da Vinci"" first appeared in 1991 and lets surgeons carry out keyhole surgery remotely, allowing them to control robot arms from a console that also provides a three-dimensional image of the proceedings. While the ""da Vinci"" system is the most widespread robotic surgery tool, Rustic says the ""Sensei Robotic Catheter System"" is also starting to be used for electrophysiology procedures on the heart.  Take a look at the past, present and future of surgery » . A new exhibition at London's Royal College of Surgeons called ""Sci-Fi Surgery: Medical Robots"" has displays ranging from the ""da Vinci"" system to prototype microbots designed to be swallowed and self-assembled in the human body. Rustic says there is much ongoing research into micro machines -- miniaturized robots that could be placed in a patient's body to gather information or carry out medical procedures. But he says that although pill cameras -- cameras that are swallowed by a patient to provide images of their digestive system -- are already in common use, micro machines remain some way off. ""Micro machines are basically one of the holy grails, but it will take a while before we see something,"" he told CNN. ""The difficulty is that even if you can make little motors you need to power them up and you have to be able to communicate with them and direct them."" Rustic says one innovation on the horizon is a device being developed by Imperial College that would allow a surgeon to remotely control an endoscope while a patient is inside a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine, which would give real-time image feedback during gastric procedures and prostate biopsies. But he adds that currently, robotic surgery devices are often prohibitively expensive and tend to be used for a narrow range of procedures. He told CNN that he would like to see an economical robot that can be reconfigured to perform a wide range of procedures in a standardized way, so that training can be simplified. ""There is currently a gap. We are trying to produce complex machines to replace surgical tools, which are hand tools. It's like when industry moved from a chisel and hammer to machine tools."" Pier Cristoforo Giulianotti is a professor at the University of Illinois department of surgery. He told CNN that as more manufacturers join the medical robotics marketplace, innovation will speed up and prices will come down. He sees the future as bringing extreme miniaturization of tools, as well as developments in augmented reality, where visual displays show computer-generated images and information overlaid onto images of the real world. Giulianotti cannot foresee a time when robots replace surgeons, but he has no doubts over the importance of robotics. ""Robot surgery is the future of medicine,"" he said.","A new exhibition is demonstrating how robotics have revolutionized surgery .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea fired two short-range missiles early Sunday towards waters east of the Korean Peninsula, the latest such launch in the tense region, a South Korean official said. The projectiles were fired at 1:20 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. Sunday (12:20 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. ET Saturday), according to the South Korean defense ministry official. They appear to have flown about 500 kilometers (310 miles). The official added that South Korea's military is monitoring the situation closely. North Korea has carried out a series of missile and rocket launches into the sea in recent months, drawing criticism from South Korea, the United States and the United Nations. South Korea and the United States, especially, have long expressed concerns about both missile launches and that Pyongyang might be moving closer to developing nuclear weapons. Prior to Sunday, the most recent such launch happened Wednesday morning, according to a South Korean defense ministry official. North Korea did not declare a no-fly zone prior to the launch, of what was assumed to be short-range ballistic missiles, from North Korea's western Hwanghae Province, the official said. No damage or injures were reported.","South Korean official: 2 short-range missiles are fired from North Korea .

"(CNN) -- The leader of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah in Lebanon said his group is responsible for launching a drone into Israel last week, and Iranians made the drone. Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said on the movement's television channel that the drone flew over ""sensitive sites"" in Israel. ""This drone is not Russian made, this drone was an Iranian made,"" he said. The drone ""was assembled by the specialized Hezbollah team. The Lebanese should be proud of that."" Israel eyes Lebanon after drone downed . The Israeli air force shot down the unmanned device Saturday over the northern Negev desert, the Israeli Defense Forces said. The drone, which was hovering over Gaza and had entered Israeli airspace, wasn't carrying weapons or explosives, military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich said. Nasrallah boasted that it wasn't the first time Hezbollah has sent aerial drones over Israel. He said the group can do it ""whenever we want"" inside ""occupied Palestine."" ""This mission was not the first one,"" he said, ""and will not be the last one, God willing.""

Hezbollah has been flying drones over Israel for years, said Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations, who specializes in drone technology proliferation and the Middle East.

""Israel usually tracks these drones as they come across the border and often doesn't bother to shoot them down,"" Zenko said. ""They just want to see what Hezbollah thinks it can do."" Drones like the one shot down on Saturday cannot even be piloted until someone has ""line control"" of the device, or is at least within 50 kilometers of it, he said. ""To call them rinky-dink would be polite,"" he said. ""The drones that Iranians display at airshows or that they tout for sale, defense industry press people describe them as crude."" These drones don't have ""hard points,"" or brackets, on which ammunition can be fixed, Zenko said, but they do have the ability to conduct surveillance.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Comedian Katt Williams was a guest -- not a burglar -- at the Georgia home he is now accused of breaking into with a crowbar, his lawyer told CNN. The house, on a horse farm in rural west Georgia, is owned by record producer Barry Hankerson, according to the police report. Williams has been living in the Coweta County, Georgia, home for nearly a month while filming a movie produced by Hankerson, attorney William Briggs said. Williams, 38, was arrested early Monday after an employee of Hankerson's -- Daniel Paul Broach -- called police and reported Williams had broken into the home with a crowbar, the police report said. A Coweta County magistrate set bail at $40,000 in a hearing Monday afternoon, which lawyers were working to post, Briggs said. The police report said about $3,500 in jewelry and collectable coins were stolen, which his lawyer said ""we absolutely deny."" ""Mr. Williams wears more than that in jewelry on his person,"" Briggs said. Briggs said Williams argued with the employee, prompting the burglary report. Hankerson spoke with investigators Monday afternoon to assure them Williams had his permission to stay indefinitely in the home he was accused of burglarizing, Briggs said. Alan Clarke, the Georgia lawyer who presented Williams in court, said Williams' bond papers were being prepared. ""The community and law enforcement have been very welcoming and kind to him,"" Clarke said. ""This is a misunderstanding which will work out quickly."" Williams smiled broadly while posing for a mug shot photo at the Coweta County jail early Monday. Williams began his career as a stand-up comic, gaining attention in 1999 for comedy club appearances. Television appearances on the BET Network led to more success. His 2006 HBO special ""Katt Williams: Pimp Chronicles Pt.1"" raised his profile to a higher level. He has acted in several movies -- including Eddie Murphy's ""Norbit"" -- and he is the voice of popular cartoons -- including ""The Boondocks."" His often raunchy style has drawn comparisons to comedy legend Richard Pryor. His most recent CD release is ""It's Pimpin' Pimpin',"" according to his Web site. Williams' was hospitalized in South Carolina in November 2008. His publicist at the time said it was for fatigue following a grueling road tour.

"Editor's note: Marvin Seppala, MD, is chief medical officer at Hazelden, a national nonprofit organization that has been treating addiction for 60 years. He is co-author of two Hazelden books: ""When Painkillers Become Dangerous"" and ""Pain-Free Living for Drug-Free People: A Guide for Pain Management in Recovery."" Marvin Seppala says opioid painkillers are highly addictive and in the same class of drugs as heroin. CENTER CITY, Minnesota (CNN) -- Prescribed opioids -- pain medication -- have become the fastest-growing addiction problem in the United States. They are second to marijuana as the most commonly used illicit substances. Vicodin and OxyContin lead the way among our youth; the 2008 ""Monitoring the Future Study"" by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that 9.7 percent of high school seniors have misused Vicodin and 4.7 percent OxyContin. There is a naïve consensus that these are safe medications because they are prescribed by physicians. However, they are extremely reinforcing, highly addictive and in the same class of drugs as heroin. Opioid prescriptions have skyrocketed since the mid '90s and with this we have seen dramatic increases in illicit diversion of the drugs, addiction treatment admissions, emergency room visits for opioid overdoses and deaths. Historically, pain has been inadequately treated by physicians, so there is good reason for the increased medical use of opioid pain medications. However, inadequate safeguards are in place and no one was prepared for the dramatic increase in addiction to these medications. Some have argued that the addiction-related problems are a small price to pay for the relief of pain for the masses, but the parents of a 17-year-old girl who died of an OxyContin overdose in Portland, Oregon, last year would most certainly disagree. Most often people obtain these medications by prescription; usually by ""doctor shopping"" -- going to multiple doctors for prescriptions. They are also purchased at ""pill mills"" from unscrupulous physicians, from dealers and on the Internet. Young people often obtain them from their parents' and grandparents' medicine cabinets. They are very easy to obtain. Heroin is actually cheaper than these medications, resulting in another problem; once addicted, requiring high doses of opioids due to rapid buildup of tolerance, people look for less expensive alternatives. Heroin use rapidly escalates, increasing the potential for IV use and the associated risk of hepatitis C, HIV and other infections. I worked with a 23-year-old who, as a senior in high school, used Vicodin that was legitimately obtained due to a football injury. He and four friends were experimenting with other drugs and overused it. They all started to obtain opioids from physicians because of various real and fake injuries. Over time they became opioid addicts and three of them moved on to heroin. None of them went on to college and they were all caught in the vicious cycle of opioid addiction; using high doses every few hours, engaging in crime to support their addiction. This is not a problem limited to our youth. The ""boomers"" are aging and developing aches and pains. Pain is the most common problem bringing people to the doctor, and opioid pain medications are frequently prescribed for even minor pain. It's quick and easy for the physician to write a prescription for these medications and move on to the next patient. The patient is satisfied and the pain is often relieved. Unfortunately, some of these prescriptions will go to those already addicted and some will initiate an addictive cycle. A 54-year-old woman came to see me for detoxification from opioids. She had obtained five prescriptions per month from five physicians. None were aware of her problem, nor suspected addiction. She was never seeking more, never tried to fill prescriptions early and appeared to be using them as prescribed. Her husband had divorced her, she could not work and her home was going into foreclosure. She was caring for her two teenagers, but was barely able to care for herself. These stories and many, many more illustrate our need for a national response to this crisis. If any other ""legitimate"" illness was killing hundreds of thousands of people per year, we would have outrage, government intervention and establish a directed response. Unfortunately, this is a disease of great stigma, and easy to neglect. We must begin to address this issue. How can we do so? • NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the ONDCP, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, should establish a task force to examine and implement a national response. • A state or national computerized pharmacy record should be maintained and examined for overuse of prescribed medications. • Law enforcement needs new laws, and resources to effectively shut down ""pill mills,"" Internet prescribers and unscrupulous physicians. State medical boards need to examine over-prescribing and strip some physicians of their license to practice medicine, as well as offer training about addiction and appropriate prescribing of pain medications. • Most states, especially in this economy, are in dire need of increased resources for addiction treatment. Effective treatments for opioid addiction exist. • We need to provide training for medical students, nursing students, psychologists and social workers in the identification, evaluation and treatment of addiction as well as identifying drug-seeking behavior. We barely provide any training to our health care professionals about addiction in spite of the fact that 25 percent of the national health care budget goes to addiction-related illness. • Chronic pain is commonly treated with opioids, but alternatives exist and in many cases are better. Among the alternatives are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, nonaddicting pain mediations and exercise. Cognitive behavioral therapies can also be very effective for chronic pain. Insurance companies need to fund the alternative treatments. • Our physicians, other prescribers and caregivers need to pay more attention to the risks associated with prescribing these medications. Appropriate prescribing, ongoing monitoring and educating patients about the risks are essential to good practice. Addiction is an equal opportunity disease. It doesn't care about your age, race, gender and socioeconomic status -- which is why nearly 24 million Americans are dependent on -- or abuse -- alcohol or other drugs. Treatment works and there is hope for lifelong recovery. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marvin D. Seppala.","Dr. Marvin Seppala: Prescription painkiller addiction is growing fast .

"(CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is on a national tour to promote her new memoir, ""Hard Choices."" But her journey has been unusually bumpy. Her recent gaffes about being ""dead broke"" or supposedly unlike the ""truly well off"" have made people wonder if she's really in touch with ordinary Americans. And then there's a legal case from her past cited in her book that makes one question whether she violated the attorney's sacred oath to never betray a client's secrets. The attorney-client privilege and its corollary duty to zealously advance the interests of even guilty clients form the very foundation of trust between lawyer and client. Clinton appeared to cavalierly toss these obligations aside in an interview she gave in the early 1980s. In 1975, the year in which Hillary Rodham married Bill Clinton, she took on the defense of 41-year-old Thomas Taylor, who was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. In Clinton's memoir, she proudly discusses her role in the case, demonstrating impressive legal skills for a young attorney fresh out of Yale Law School. Opinion: Why Clinton's comments matter . I was beginning my legal career as a prosecutor in New York during this time and it is clear to me that Clinton's legal tactics were quite consistent with those used by experienced and ethical defense attorneys of that era. Today's preachers of political correctness, many of whom heartily endorse the Clinton candidacy, may be shocked at the details of the future senator's forceful attack on the 12-year-old rape victim in the Taylor case, but times were different then. For example, while seeking to compel a psychiatric examination of the sixth grade victim, Clinton submitted her own sworn affidavit saying she had: ""...been informed that the complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and engage in...fantasizing ... she has in the past made false accusations about persons, claiming they had attacked her body... she exhibits an unusual stubbornness and temper when she does not get her way."" The Clinton affidavit stated that a ""child psychology"" expert advised her that ""children in early adolescence tend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences and that adolescents with disorganized families, such as the complainant, are even more prone to such behavior."" The language here would score a perfect 10 on the scale of political incorrectness in 2014. The ""disorganized families"" are obviously just ordinary poor people with maybe a dash of single-mother household thrown in for good measure. And the 12-year-old girl is ""stubborn"" and has a ""temper."" Really? Is that a problem in girls? Opinion: Petty attacks on Hillary just won't matter . In her book, Clinton describes her daring visit to a ""bombed-out"" (read: ""African-American"") Brooklyn neighborhood to obtain the services of a renowned expert in blood analysis. This expert's reputation pushed a nervous prosecutor into believing that his key piece of corroborating evidence -- blood and bodily fluids on the victim's underwear -- would be thrown out of court. Without this evidence, which would have sealed Taylor's fate, the prosecutor folded and accepted a plea to a lesser count. The result was that the man accused of rape that Clinton defended served only about a year in prison for an offense worth, even in 1975, a 15-year state prison sentence. After one short year this ""rootless"" (Clinton's word) drifter was back on the street. While all this may sound horrible to the nonlawyers of the world, in fact everything Clinton did as defense counsel at the time appears to have been ethical and proper. Clinton's defense focused on the child's lack of believability and on throwing out the physical evidence based on the boneheaded prosecutorial destruction of the remaining testable blood-stained cloth. Looks like good lawyering so far. When looking at this case, the press has generally focused on Clinton's ""inappropriate"" laughter in an interview with an Arkansas journalist in the early 1980s. Demonstrating a truly tin political ear, she had consented to being tape-recorded. In listening to the tape, it is apparent to me that Clinton was not laughing about getting a man accused of rape off the hook, but rather at the ineptness of the prosecutors. On tape, she may also have been struggling to bond with the reporter, who often initiates the laughter. This type of shoptalk and gallows humor often takes place behind closed doors among criminal lawyers and prosecutors. But nobody tape records the talk, nobody talks this way ""on the record"" to reporters. Even the sleaziest of criminal lawyers don't generally brag about getting a man accused in the rape of a child off the hook. It might make attendance at local PTA meetings and ""Back to School Night"" more than a little uncomfortable. Lawyers have an obligation to provide a strong defense to all whom they represent, even those who committed crimes. The Founding Fathers designed an adversarial system requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the right to counsel. Opinion: How Hillary Clinton flubbed the wealth question . Clinton performed her role as defense counsel to an unpopular, indigent client with skill and competence, affording him the constitutional rights cherished by Americans. So it is sad really to see her throw this all away and apparently betray the secrets and interests of her client for the sake of telling a good story to a reporter. But that is exactly what she did when during a subsequent interview (also in the 1980s) she revealed that Taylor had taken and passed a polygraph test. She said on tape that she has ""forever"" lost her ""faith"" in polygraph tests. What Clinton really may have been saying here is that her client lied in claiming innocence when he took the polygraph test because he was really guilty. In other words, she appears to have outed Taylor as a liar and a rapist. By framing the story in this way, Clinton violated not only the attorney-client privilege but also her obligation to fully represent the interests of her client as required by the attorney's ""Code of Professional Responsibility."" It is utterly improper for a defense attorney to reveal a client confidence in this way. As a veteran teller of legal ""war stories,"" my advice to Clinton is if you are going to tell one, leave out the child rapist case. Clinton may have handled the case tactics well, but the way she talked about her client raises a serious question about her devotion to legal ethics in her early years of practice. We can only hope that the experience she has accumulated in public life has taught the former secretary of state that a devotion to ethical conduct and fidelity to the interests of those she represents are critically important character traits.","Paul Callan: Hillary Clinton defended a man accused of rape early in her career .

"(CNN) -- Citing positive steps taken since the hazing death of a drum major, Florida A&M University's interim leader said Thursday he has lifted the suspension of the school's famous marching band. The Tallahassee, Florida, university's band, called the Marching 100, had been one of the top university marching bands in the United States, noted for its elaborate dance formations and innovative style incorporating popular music. But Robert Champion's death, and other reports of hazing, sullied its reputation. Champion was beaten on a bus after a November 2011 football game in Orlando, Florida, as part of a band hazing ritual. The 26-year-old died ""within an hour"" afterward, medical examiners reported. The Marching 100 was suspended by the university shortly after Champion's death. The school has said it was making reforms to address the problem of hazing both on and off campus, including requiring all students to sign an anti-hazing pledge. In a statement released Thursday, FAMU Interim President Larry Robinson said a ""comprehensive"" anti-hazing plan includes a revised student code of conduct procedures, enhanced means of reporting and investigating allegations, a new anti-hazing website, and more money for research on the problem. Officials said the band's first post-suspension performance has not been scheduled. Its new director, Sylvester Young, reported for work earlier this month. ""When considering all of the measures we have put in place, I believe this constitutes us having the right conditions,"" Robinson said. Champion's parents, Robert Sr. and Pam, said they were not consulted about the decision. Their attorney told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB that hazing has occurred this year at the university. ""They are putting dollars over the students,"" Robert Champion Sr. said of FAMU. Pam Champion said anti-hazing steps taken by FAMU are insufficient. ""You need a lot more in order to get that message out,"" she told WSB. ""You need to be in those schools, in their face, every opportunity that you can get."" Robinson's predecessor as FAMU president, James Ammons, stepped down in July 2012 after trustees issued a no-confidence motion in his performance. The vote followed a series of investigations after Champion's death. The vote also related to financial audits that resulted from the hazing investigation. Twelve former students faced manslaughter charges in the Champion case, attorneys familiar with the case said in March. The band member's roommate in May pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, to a felony charge of hazing resulting in death and first-degree hazing. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Late student's parents criticize the decision .

"(CNN) -- More than 600 people were evacuated from a restive Syrian city on Sunday, after gunfire interrupted a U.N.-brokered humanitarian pause, state media reported. Syria's government-run Syria TV channel and news agency SANA said Sunday afternoon that 611 people were convoyed out of the city of Homs. SANA reported most of the people evacuated were women, children and senior citizens, citing the governor of the province, Talal al-Barazi. Vehicles from the Red Crescent and United Nations had a difficult time entering the city over the weekend as they were targeted by gunfire and explosives. But workers managed to deliver some aid to the thousands of people in the besieged section of the city known as the Old City of Homs, where rebels battle government troops and each other. A photo on the Twitter feed of the Syrian Red Crescent showed dozens of people standing in the rubble of a street as aid workers passed out supplies and food. ""Although the team was shelled and fired upon we managed to deliver 250 food parcels,190 hygiene kits and chronic diseases medicines,"" the organization said in a tweet on Saturday. The team said that one driver suffered a minor injury when explosions and gunfire hit near the convoy in Homs. The convoy left, but two of the four trucks were damaged and had to be left behind, the organization said. Who targeted the aid workers is in dispute. A Wall Street Journal reporter in Syria told CNN that workers in the convoy had no doubt the fire came from government forces. But Sam Dagher said al-Barazi told him it was two rival rebel factions -- one that wants to keep civilians as human shields and another that wants to exchange them for aid. Valerie Amos, the U.N. humanitarian chief, lamented Saturday that the ""three-day humanitarian pause agreed (upon) was broken today and aid workers (were) deliberately targeted."" ""Today's events serve as a stark reminder of the dangers that civilians and aid workers face every day across Syria,"" said Amos, who applauded ""the courage and tenacity"" of U.N. and Red Crescent aid workers. Video from the scene posted by activists showed bullet holes in the aid vehicles and damage to buildings from explosions. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency had reported that four Syrian Arab Red Crescent workers were wounded Saturday by gunfire from ""terrorist groups"" while trying to deliver aid. First civilians evacuated . The U.N.-led operation to help civilians wishing to leave the Old CIty of Homs started Friday with the evacuation of 83 women, children and elderly civilians after an agreement between the government and opposition groups for a cease-fire that was also intended to allow humanitarian aid to reach the city on Saturday. Before this weekend's evacuations, as many as 2,500 people were thought to be trapped in the Old City of Homs, parts of which have been under siege since June 2012. A video posted Saturday to YouTube showed more than a dozen civilians carrying bundles as they walked between four U.N. vehicles -- two on each side -- in an apparent attempt to avoid being shot. It was not clear whether they reached their destination. The killing flared anew Saturday across the nation, with more than 80 people killed, 10 of them children and six women, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported. Five of the deaths occurred in Homs, it said. Nearly half of the deaths -- 41 -- occurred in Aleppo, where video shot by an opposition activist and posted to YouTube showed the graphic aftermath of what the poster said was a barrel-bomb attack carried out by government helicopters: buildings with their faces blown off, bodies with their limbs blown off and cars ablaze. Barrel bombs are drums packed with explosives and shrapnel. ""Each and every barrel bomb filled with metal shrapnel and fuel launched against innocent Syrians underscores the barbarity of a regime that has turned its country into a super magnet for terror,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week in a statement after another reported barrel-bomb attack on the northern city, which has become a flashpoint in the war.","NEW: State media say 611 people evacuated Sunday after 83 moved Friday .

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- On any other day, Copacabana Beach has a hypnotic ability to relax its guests. Its crescent-like coast -- where coconut water is coolly sipped, Brazilian sun beats down and hodgepodge hotels stand, juxtaposed against the dramatic peak of the Sugarloaf Mountain and her sisters -- calms the most stressed-out of Cariocas and turns city-workaholics into lackadaisical loungers. But not on this day; currently there is a very different atmosphere on its golden sands. Events have conspired for the benevolent beach to now act as a gritty site of torture, where the searing heat is only adding to the discomfort of the thousands gathered. Nearly all to a man are wrapped in yellow and wracked with anxiety. Many hide their faces, unable to bear the sights their eyes witness, struggling to contemplate the repercussions of events that are transpiring. The Jumbotron screen, that sits before those assembled, beams live pictures of a nation on the precipice. This proud country's heroes, the warriors of the people, have battled with all their hearts only to sit moments from humbling, embarrassing defeat. But this is not a war with the lives of soldiers on the line, or a natural calamity that has befallen a population. No, Brazil's national football team is in a World Cup penalty shootout with regional rivals Chile and, as a result, 200 million people are on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Security guards abandon their posts to gather around surveillance vehicles, which have their TVs trained to live football rather than CCTV feeds of trouble hotspots. On the underground metro, each commuter battles to get mobile phone connection so they can update the rest of the carriage with the latest news. The streets are silent bar the overspill of punters straining their necks to view the action through the doorways and windows of fan-filled restaurants. A 22-year-old man called Neymar steps up to the penalty spot to take his chance and the entire country, including the thousands at the FIFA Fan Fest on Copacabana Beach, holds its breath and prays for salvation ... -----||||------ . There aren't many countries in the world that have a national holiday every time the national teams play, or whose media eclipsed reports of the Apollo 12 moon landing with news of PelÃ©'s 1,000th goal. But Brazil's relationship with the side they lovingly term the 'Selecao' is far from normal. ""When you're born in Brazil your father will hang the shirt of the team you're going to follow on the door of your room. There's a joke we say that sexual orientation, religion ... all of that you can choose but not the team. Football is part of your life even in the hospital when you're born. ""And for many, when you die, your coffin is covered with the flag of the team ... so football is from birth to death,"" Jamil Chade, European correspondent for Estado de Sao Paulo told CNN. At a time when the so-called 'spiritual home of football' is playing host to the World Cup, a tournament that has fans dew-eyed the world over regardless, it is maybe understandable why emotions are currently running high. Ever since British enthusiasts formally introduced the sport in 1892, Brazil has been besotted by football. Some say it's tantamount to a religion but for David Goldblatt, author of ""Futebol Nation: The Story of Brazil through Soccer"", this clichÃ© misses important details. Infographic: How women are watching the World Cup . ""There isn't a divine being, moral framework or holy book so it's better to think of it as a mixture of national ritual, popular theater and collective soap opera,"" Goldblatt told CNN. ""[Football has a] church element, in terms of ritual collective gatherings, in a regular place in a regular time. It's a multi-level, multi-character rolling story commenting on the rest of the world. And it's a form of popular theater in the way the dramatic narrative of the matches plays out. So it's not a religion but the rest add ups to quite a lot."" And it was for these reasons the sport has played such a powerful role in shaping the Brazilian national identity after it became independent in 1822. ""When the intelligentsia asked 'what is Brazil?' the pervading idea was that of a white, European nation in the tropics ... which worked for about five people in Rio, but for a country that has a 60% Afro-Brazilian mix it was never really going to be enough,"" Goldblatt said. An ideal was needed to bind the nation, one that was representative of the demographic heritage of Brazil and at the same time emblematic of the aspirations of the new state. Football, Goldblatt argues, fitted the bill. ""Firstly, [Brazil] get huge international recognition when they come third in the 1938 World Cup. Secondly, football had appeal beyond the literate population, [it was] a medium that could ... reach the high degree of illiterate across the country. And crucially, from the 1930s it's the first arena in Brazilian public life that was ethnically integrated."" It's a sentiment with which Chade, a Sao Paulo native and resident, agrees: ""Football is one of the few elements that unites the sentiment of Brazil. There's very little that unifies someone who lives in the Amazon with someone who lives in Sao Paulo. ""There are few elements that glue the society together. That is why it's such a drama when the 'Selecao' lose, because it's not the football team losing it's your own identity as a Brazilian that is questioned."" Politics and art alike became intertwined with this powerful vehicle for connecting with a diverse and disparate population. Eminent Brazilian sociologist Gilberto Freye saw football as integral to the emerging personality of his home nation. After watching the team fail in its attempt to become world champions in France 1938, he wrote: . ""Our style of football seems to contrast to the [acute and angular] Europeans because of a set of characteristics: surprise, craftiness, shrewdness, recklessness and individual expression and spontaneity. Our mulatto (mixed race) football is an expression of our social order."" And before 1950 a key debate in Brazil was whether their social order was enough to be included within the world's ""concert of civilized nations."" Despite sending troops to the Second World War, Brazil's request for a seat on the U.N. Security Council had been rejected. Then they lost out on the 1950 World Cup to rivals Uruguay, despite being hosts. ""When the loss to Uruguay happened in the 1950 there was a thought that our destiny was to forever be in the margins of the center of the world. The drama was not the loss on the pitch, or the suicides that followed but it was a crisis of national identity,"" Chade said. ""Nelson Rodrigues [a famous Brazilian playwright, journalist and iconoclast] said that when we won the World Cup in 1958 that: 'After 458 years we have finally stood up.' ""So we're not talking just about football [when it comes to the Selecao], of course it's just eleven against eleven, of course it doesn't change anything in your life, but it is a mirror of a situation -- and in the case of Brazil it reflects our national identity,"" Chade added. To this day the national team also mirror many of the key issues in Brazilian society. ""Brazil's booming economy is built on commodity export: iron ore, sugar, soya beans and oil without ever getting the key value of these because they end up being processed further down the value chain ... and it's the same with football,"" said Goldblatt. ""In the year 2009, 1200 footballers left Brazil to play elsewhere. Only the old, the very young and the not very good stay home ... Now, if you want to see the best Brazilian footballers, you need to watch the [European] Champions League."" ""This [current national team], bar two, are all playing overseas. So they're more cosmopolitan and to my eyes they play European football. I'm not sure a Brazilian style exists any more ... but it's an inevitable consequence of globalization,"" Goldblatt added. Chade agrees the Brazilian style is all but gone: ""Some say Germany are playing like Brazil used to. It's not a process that's happening just with Brazil. I think [globalization] feeds both ways. But if a player leaves Brazil at 18 and plays in another league with another characteristic until 32 how can he play with a Brazilian characteristic."" Not that a change in style seems to have diminished the passion of the support that Brazil enjoy. -----||||------ . ""Goooooooll!!!!!"" shout a million or more Brazil fans as Neymar slots his penalty into the corner of the goal-net. Anxiety and fear turn to hope and excitement. Tears remain poised for release. Chile's Gonzalo Jara is next up. He just needs to score from 12 yards to keep his side in the competition. Thwack! He shoots ... and hits the post! A collective shedding of emotion takes place across Brazil's vast land, relief and elation painted on the faces of the faithful, tears rolling forth, fireworks exploding like machine guns. The 'Selecao' live to fight another day, progress to be one-game closer to winning the World Cup they covet so dearly, and show the planet that Brazil is as vibrant and beautiful as ever. Tune in Friday, when the fate of the nation will once again be decided.","The so-called 'spiritual home of football' is playing host to the World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Under fire from tens of thousands of users, the social networking site Facebook said early Wednesday it is reverting to its old policy on user information -- for now. Backlash against Facebook began after a consumer advocate site flagged Facebook's policy change. The site posted a brief message on users' home pages that said it was returning to its previous ""Terms of Use"" policy ""while we resolve the issues that people have raised."" The ""Terms of Use"" is the legalese tacked on to the bottom of most Web sites that details what the site's owners can do with the information that users provide. Facebook, the Web's most popular social networking site, has been caught in a content-rights battle after revealing earlier this month that it was granting itself permanent rights to users' photos, wall posts and other information even after a user closed an account. The popular site allows users to create personal profiles where they can then connect with one another, upload photos and share links. The site boasts more than 150 million active users. Member backlash against Facebook began over the weekend after a consumer advocate Web site, The Consumerist, flagged a change made to Facebook's policy earlier in the month. The company deleted a sentence from the old Terms of Use. That sentence said Facebook could not claim any rights to original content that a user uploaded once the user closed his or her account. It replaced it with: ""You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. ... (H)owever, you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content."" In response, Chris Walters wrote in the Consumerist post, ""Make sure you never upload anything you don't feel comfortable giving away forever, because it's Facebook's now."" Thousands of indignant members either canceled their accounts or created online petitions. Among them were more than 64,000 who joined a group called ""The People Against the new Terms of Service."" iReport.com: Too much information posted online? On Monday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg tried to quell the controversy by saying the company's philosophy is that ""people own their information and control who they share it with."" But members were not appeased because the site did not fix its Terms of Use. The company, in its post Wednesday, said it was returning to its previous Terms of Use because of the ""feedback"" it had received. ""As Mark expressed in his blog post on Monday, it was never our intention to confuse people or make them uneasy about sharing on Facebook,"" company spokesman Barry Schnitt said in a blog post. ""I also want to be very clear that Facebook does not, nor have we ever, claimed ownership over people's content. Your content belongs to you."" iReport.com: Your thoughts on Facebook's about-face . Schnitt said the company is in the process of rewording its Terms of Use in ""simple language that defines Facebook's rights much more specifically."" ""Well that worked pretty fast,"" wrote member Al Reford of Vancouver, British Columbia. ""Numbers count when giving feedback :)"" And Shahrzad Grami of St. Paul, Minnesota, added: "" YAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!! nice job guys! i won't be canceling my account after all.""","Facebook this month changed its policy to say user content belonged to Facebook .

"Washington (CNN) -- Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Wednesday his department estimates that four out of five schools in the United States will not make their ""No Child Left Behind"" benchmarks by the law's target year of 2014 -- and when the test scores are counted for the current school year, numbers could show that U.S. schools are already at that failure rate. He blamed that failure rate on the law itself, not on schools. ""This law has created dozens of ways for schools to fail and very few ways to help them succeed. We should get out of the business of labeling schools as failures and create a new law that is fair and flexible, and focused on the schools and students most at risk,"" Duncan told the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Under the No Child Left Behind law, originally passed in 2001, all students are expected to meet a level of ""proficiency"" by 2014. Because standards under No Child Left Behind are higher from year to year as 2014 approaches, the percentage of schools that are not meeting ""Adequate Yearly Progress"" could rise from the current level of 37% to 82%, Duncan said. Duncan pointed out that federal law requires states and districts to ""implement the same set of interventions in every school that is not meeting AYP, regardless of the individual needs and circumstances of those schools."" Under the Education Department's estimates, 82% of America's schools ""could be labeled 'failing' and, over time, the required remedies for all of them are the same -- which means we will really fail to serve the students in greatest need,"" said Duncan. ""By mandating and prescribing one-size-fits-all solutions, No Child Left Behind took away the ability of local and state educators to tailor solutions to the unique needs of their students,"" Duncan said calling the concept ""fundamentally flawed."" Duncan was on Capitol Hill to both push for the reauthorization and revamping of the No Child Left Behind law, and to defend President Barack Obama's budget request for 2012. The 2012 budget request comes to $77.4 billion -- an increase of $4.5 billion over the 2011 request. Republicans on the committee questioned any increase in the budget in the current economic climate. Committee chairman Rep. John Kline, R-Minnesota, said in his opening remarks, ""As we work to answer the question about the appropriate role for the federal government in education, one thing is for sure: it must be less costly and less intrusive."" Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, asked the secretary if he though he could be successful without an increase in funding saying, ""If you cut the right way and put the money into the systems that you know work, could you do that?"" The education secretary answered, ""We have to do that, anyway, and I continue to think we under-invest"" compared to higher-performing countries.","Education Secretary Arne Duncan testifies before a congressional committee .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Thursday that he has picked William Daley, a Clinton administration commerce secretary, to serve as his new chief of staff. The move, part of a major White House reshuffling, was warmly received by some traditional opponents of the president. It set off alarm bells among some more liberal groups that the president is shifting to the political center in anticipation of the 2012 campaign. Daley is the son of legendary Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and brother of the city's current mayor, Richard M. Daley. He runs Midwest operations for the investment bank JP Morgan Chase, and his appointment is expected to help patch up Obama's frosty relations with the business community after nasty battles over health care reform, taxes and government regulations. ""Few Americans can boast the breadth of experience that Bill brings to this job,"" Obama said at the White House. He ""possesses a deep understanding of how jobs are created"" and has a ""smidgen of awareness of how government works."" The president said Daley would bring ""strong values"" and ""forward-looking vision"" to the administration. The appointment drew praise from one of the top Republicans on Capitol Hill. ""I frankly think it's kind of a hopeful sign,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""This is a guy who's actually been out in the private sector, been a part of business. ... My first reaction is, it sounds like a good idea."" The pick also received a positive response from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbied heavily against expanding health care coverage and tightening regulations on Wall Street and spent millions on behalf of Republican candidates in the 2010 midterm elections. ""Bill Daley is a man of stature and extraordinary experience in government, business, trade negotiations, and global affairs,"" Thomas Donahue, the group's CEO, said in a statement hailing the appointment. ""He's an accomplished manager and strong leader. We look forward to working with him to accelerate our recovery, grow the economy, create jobs, and tackle America's global challenges."" The reaction from the president's base with organized labor, however, was noticeably cooler. ""The president is of course entitled to choose a chief of staff in whom he has complete confidence,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ""Yet President Obama and his administration will ultimately be judged by results -- whether the economy recovers robustly and begins to generate good jobs on the scale needed to improve the lives of working people."" Trumka warned that Obama ""needs a chief of staff who will reach out to diverse constituencies and make sure that the voices of ordinary Americans are heard in the White House."" Daley will replace Rahm Emanuel, a former Illinois congressman who has returned to Chicago to run for mayor. Obama's interim chief of staff, Pete Rouse, will stay on as a counselor to the president for two years. ""I would not be where I am today without (Pete Rouse's) extraordinary counsel,"" Obama said. ""I cannot imagine life here without him."" The appointment of Daley is the latest in a series of high-level personnel moves by the White House that have been announced in recent days. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker is stepping down as chairman of Obama's outside economic advisory panel, Democratic sources familiar with the move said Thursday. Volcker had been a strong advocate for much tougher regulations for Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis, although his position as chairman of the president's Economic Recovery Advisory Board gave him little clout to actually enact policy. And senior officials say Obama is expected to name another Clinton administration veteran, Gene Sperling, as chairman of the National Economic Council. Sperling is currently a top adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and won high marks inside the administration for negotiating last month's tax deal with congressional Republicans. He would replace fellow Clinton alumnus Lawrence Summers. In addition, senior adviser David Axelrod is planning to leave the White House in early 2011 to help run Obama's re-election campaign, while White House spokesman Robert Gibbs announced Wednesday that he would soon leave the administration in what Gibbs himself called a ""major retooling"" of a White House now dealing with a closely divided Congress. When then-President Bill Clinton lost control of both chambers of Congress to Republicans in 1994, he tacked to the center and was able to score major legislative victories and easily win re-election in 1996. Many Democrats are rejoicing at Daley's selection now. ""Perfect for the job,"" said Steve Elmendorf, a lobbyist who served as chief of staff to then-House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt in the Clinton and Bush years. ""He has an impressive combination of stature and substance and political smarts."" But some liberals beyond organized labor are suspicious of Daley's close ties to the business community and are concerned that his appointment signals a sharp shift to the center. ""This was a real mistake by the White House,"" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ""Bill Daley consistently urges the Democratic Party to pursue a corporate agenda that alienates both Independent and Democratic voters. If President Obama listens to that kind of political advice from Bill Daley, Democrats will suffer a disastrous 2012."" Daley currently sits on the board of the Washington think tank Third Way, a position he took in July. In a statement announcing the move, Daley said voters weren't returning to conservative ideology, but that ""the left's agenda has not won the support of a majority of Americans."" It was a theme he also articulated in a 2009 piece in The Washington Post, arguing that Democrats needed to steer ""a more moderate course on the key issues of the day."" Not surprisingly, the appointment drew praise from Daley's brother, who told reporters he was ""very honored"" that his sibling would be joining the White House. ""I believe he brings a passion, a commitment of service, both in the public and private sector,"" Richard Daley said. ""He brings a commitment of service to both the president personally and to the United States of America."" Asked whether the appointment would mean more federal money for Chicago, the mayor said, ""I'm praying.""

"(CNN) -- You have shot more than enough photos, captured tons of video and have written a rough draft of your story, so what's next? You always want to double- and triple-check your story elements before sending them in. Here are a few tips to help you determine the best elements to pick when putting together your story. Don't over edit, but give it a few reads . When writing, think first about the overall purpose of the piece. What is your intention? It could be to shine light on something that no one else has covered. In all instances, consider both sides of the equation. If you are simply telling the personal tale of one person, consider what about this person's story is interesting to you. What are the things you would need to know that would make your story stand out to a reader? Find a way to relate the story to your audience. Write all that out and then give it a couple of reads. It's always easiest to put everything down on paper and then go back and edit as necessary. Editing out what slows down the text is best. But if you have a good quote, center the piece on it. For example, if you're covering a protest, include some of the best quotes from the protesters you interviewed. Was there a recurring theme among them? Did folks have a personal stake in being at the protest? Review the strongest interviews and quotes, then write your supporting text to give the user context and explain why they should care. Choose the most compelling photos . You can have a maximum of 10 photos for your story, so you want to make sure they complement the story in the best way possible. If you are writing a story about protests, include images that reflect the angst, frustration and emotion in protesters' faces. Pick the photos that provide a snapshot of that particular moment. You want to take your audience inside your story. Video and text should complement each other . What is the value of the video? Usually, when we have text and video, we want each element to be able to stand on its own. If they are published separately, the reader should be able to follow the story. However, when video is combined with text, the video should be added value to the overall vision or message of the piece. Video and text should complement each other. The text should not just be a transcription of the video. In keeping with the same theme, if you're covering a protest, then the video should put the user in that moment. The video could include great natural sound of protesters, chanting and speaking. It could provide one person's point of view as opposed to putting every single protester in the video. This will also help keep your video within the two- to three-minute time frame. For more tips on storytelling, visit the boot camp page, where you can find all the tips from the past six weeks.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night that some 34,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan will have returned home by this time next year. The move will reduce the number of U.S. forces in the country by more than half. There are now about 66,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A Washington Post poll on Tuesday showed that 80% of registered voters support the president's policy to end the war in Afghanistan. In January, Obama met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Washington, where they agreed to accelerate the military transition in Afghanistan. Afghan forces will take the lead in combat missions throughout the country starting in the spring, instead of mid-year, as was previously expected. 5 things we learned . Afghan forces are ready . Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, said National Army forces are ""completely ready"" to take over the country's security responsibilities. ""We welcome the announcement of the withdrawal ... and we (will) always remember their efforts and sacrifice,"" he said. ""We are very happy that these soldiers are returning home to their families."" The Taliban also welcomed the news, saying Western governments ""must salvage themselves from the protracted and pointless war in Afghanistan."" But as expected, the militants continued their call for a complete withdrawal of outside forces. ""The Afghans should be granted control, choice of government and sovereignty of their country,"" the Taliban statement said. ""If not such then our sacred Jihad will intensify and forge ahead successfully even if one foreign soldier is present in our country ..."" Some U.S. forces will remain . The White House has been considering a range of troop levels -- from up to 15,000 to none -- to remain in Afghanistan once the combat mission officially ends at the end of 2014. Those options were submitted by Gen. John Allen, who until recently was the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Allen's final days in that job were marred by an investigation linked to the sex scandal that prompted the resignation of David Petraeus as CIA director. Allen was cleared of allegations that he wrote potentially inappropriate e-mails to a woman involved in the scandal. He is now the nominee to become the top NATO commander and was replaced in Afghanistan this week by Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford. More troop reductions ahead . A senior administration official told CNN on Tuesday that in addition to withdrawing 34,000 U.S. troops by next February, more reductions will continue through the end of 2014 as Afghans take full responsibility for their security. The United States and its partners in the war in Afghanistan have ""struck devastating blows against al Qaeda, and Afghan forces continue to grow stronger with 352,000 now in training or on duty,"" the official said. ""By the end of 2014, we will responsibly bring our war in Afghanistan to a close,"" the official said, adding that Obama made his decision ""based on the recommendations of the military and his national security team,"" consultations with Karzai and ""international coalition partners."" A key factor for meeting Obama's plan is the fighting season in Afghanistan, which runs from spring to fall, depending on weather conditions, officials said. ""Commanders will have discretion on pace of this drawdown which will allow them to maintain the force they need through the fighting season,"" according to one of those officials. U.S. withdrawal is 'tough love' for disbelieving Afghans . Afghans in lead but U.S. still there . Also on Tuesday, another U.S. official told CNN that the U.S. and NATO alliance will announce that by March, Afghan troops will lead all security in Afghanistan. That announcement was expected to be made this summer but will now be made within days, the source said. Afghan forces are leading nearly 90% of operations across Afghanistan. With Afghan units in the lead, U.S. troops will still be directly involved in combat for months, the official said. American special forces also will remain in far flung outposts partnering with Afghan units. Opinion: Abandon Afghanistan? A dumb idea . A new general in charge . Dunford will oversee the final two years of the war and the withdrawal of nearly all troops. At a change-of-command ceremony in Kabul on Sunday, Dunford remarked on the job ahead. ""Today is not about change, it's about continuity,"" he said, alongside Allen and other senior NATO and Afghan officials. ""I'll endeavor to continue the momentum of the campaign and support the people of Afghanistan as they seize the opportunity for a brighter future."" Dunford has a reputation among Marines as a thoughtful, calm leader, with more than 22 months under his belt of commanding troops in Iraq. These changes come amid debate about impending budget cuts that some say would have grave consequences for the military unless Congress acts to avert them by the start of next month. Sequestration is a series of automatic, across-the-board cuts to government agencies, totaling $1.2 trillion over 10 years. The cuts would be split 50-50 between defense and domestic discretionary spending. More than $500 billion would be cut from the Defense Department and other national security agencies, with the rest coming from domestic programs, like national parks, federal courts, the FBI, food inspections and housing aid. Outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has been a harsh critic of the cuts. ""For those of you who have ever seen 'Blazing Saddles,'"" he said in a recent speech at Georgetown University, there ""is the scene of the sheriff putting the gun to his head in order to establish law and order. That is sequestration."" CNN's Mike Mount, Emily Schultze and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","NEW: The Afghan military says it's ready to defend the country .

"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- African countries should invest in broadband infrastructure to improve the welfare of their people, according to Ajai Chowdhry, co-founder and CEO of HCL Infosystems, the global IT services provider. The Indian entrepreneur, who is often described as India's equivalent to Bill Gates, said access to information will be critical in solving many of the continent's problems. ""I've a very strong belief that Africa should take a leadership position in putting up broadband right down to every village and you'll see the change,"" he said. ""If you give people information you can actually transform Africa."" Chowdhry was co-chair of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania last May. With the theme ""Rethinking Africa's Growth Strategy,"" WEF's summit focused on the continent's relationship with major economic partners and looked at its options for a sustainable future. In 1976, Chowdhry co-founded HCL in a Delhi garage, along with five others deployed emerging microprocessor technology to create India's first personal computer. He urged African nations to connect to each other in a similar way to the European Union. ""Your power to negotiate becomes better if you all come together,"" he said. Connectivity is a familiar issue for Mr Chowdhry. His company, which has now grown to become a global enterprise, with 65,000 employees, has been awarded a major contract by the Indian government to implement ""Pan-Africa"" -- a networking project that will enable Africa's 53 heads of state to communicate over videoconferencing. Mr Chowdhry spoke to CNN about the business ties between India and Africa and his company's expansion plans. CNN: Is India really eyeing Africa as an investment opportunity? Ajai Chowdhry: There are many traditional links between Africa and India, for more than 40 years. If you look at 1949, local currency here in Tanzania was the Indian rupee. A lot of Africans have gone to India to study and for medical tourism, because we have great medical facilities. Our prime minister enjoys also deep connects with different heads of state in Africa, so there's a lot of interest both from the private sector and the government. CNN: What do Indian companies gain by working in Africa? Obviously money is the ultimate end but what specifics can they get from Africa? AC: It's a question of a billion Indian people and a billion African people -- the problems and solutions in India are absolutely the same as in Africa. So if you actually create products for India they can definitely be sold into Africa and similar solutions can be created. CNN: What's the importance of the South-South trade? Have you seen a difference in the past few years? AC: Yes, there is a deep shift taking place and India specifically is very interested in growing its ties with Africa in many ways. There's a whole bunch of Indian companies that have actually come and set-up training centers in Africa and more are coming in. CNN: The subcontinent is often lauded for where it's come from and where it's now. Why has Africa struggled to match? You said India has a billion people, Africa has a billion people. Where is that disconnect happening? AC: Its' probably the fact that India is one country -- in Africa you are looking at 50 odd countries so obviously there are rules, regulations, governments that are different -- that's really Africa's challenge. But if all of Africa comes together, pretty much like what's happening in Europe, then I think the whole situation will change and they can actually bargain better for cooperation with other parts of the world. Your power to negotiate becomes better if you all come together. CNN: What challenges have you come across in your investments in Africa? AC: We haven't really found any great challenges, because for us the conditions are so similar. We are quite used to diversity because in India, although it's one country, there are 30 different states. Plus, what we've seen is a lot of trust between Africans and Indians because of what's happened in the past. CNN: What can Africa provide to Indian companies, other than just markets? AC: Markets are of course very important, but one of the areas we would be looking at is to have other locations to work out from. So maybe one day when we don't want to do some of the outsourcing work that we do for the U.S., UK or European companies, then maybe we can actually partner with African companies to actually deliver. CNN:  Africa has been long settled with the reputation of providing minerals and raw products. Do you think there is hope for manufacturing and skills now? AC: Definitely manufacturing because you have to look at your domestic market. India emerged out of the problems in the last years pretty much unscathed, because we have a huge domestic market. But the one area where Africa can make a big difference is by not just looking at putting up roads -- it should look at putting up internet broadband-type infrastructure. One question I've always answered is why are the poor, poor. The reason why is because they don't have information. If you give people information you can actually transform Africa. I've a very strong belief that Africa should take a leadership position in putting up broadband right down to every village and you'll see the change. If you actually make something like that happen in Africa, the continent will be transformed.","Access to broadband internet is key for Africa's future, says Ajai Chowdhry .

"Washington (CNN) -- The National Security Agency notched a much-needed win in court Friday after a series of setbacks over the legality and even the usefulness of its massive data collection program. A federal judge in New York ruled the NSA's bulk collection of data on nearly every phone call made in the United States was legal. The ruling contrasts with another ruling last week by a federal judge in Washington, who called the same program ""almost Orwellian"" and likely unconstitutional. In his ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said the NSA's bulk collection of phone records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act was legal. The program was revealed in classified leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. ""But the question of whether that program should be conducted is for the other two coordinate branches of government to decide,"" said the ruling by Pauley, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, said it would appeal Pauley's ruling. ""We are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government's surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,"" said Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU's deputy legal director. Review: NSA snooping program should stay in place . President Barack Obama is examining a review of the surveillance efforts that recommended changes in how the NSA program was conducted. Obama said last week he would decide what to do about it in January. Last week, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the NSA's bulk collection of metadata -- phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content -- apparently violates privacy rights. His preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice, but Leon limited the decision only to their cases. ""I cannot imagine a more 'indiscriminate' and 'arbitrary invasion' than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval,"" said Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush. ""Surely, such a program infringes on 'that degree of privacy' that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment."" Leon's ruling said the ""plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a Fourth Amendment claim,"" adding ""as such, they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury."" He rejected the government's argument that a 1979 Maryland case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata, noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in three decades. Leon also noted the government ""does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature."" However, he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information, pending an appeal by the government. A Justice Department spokesman said in response to Leon's ruling that ""we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found."" Explosive revelations this year by Snowden triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Snowden's disclosures led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance. The NSA has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. The case before Leon involved approval for surveillance in April by a judge at a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for ""foreign intelligence purposes."" Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s, the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping, data analysis and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States. The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government's ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad, eventually including the metadata collection. In order to collect the information, the government has to demonstrate it is ""relevant"" to an international terrorism investigation. However, the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide: ""A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person."" In defending the program, Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA's director, told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that ""15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 (of the Patriot Act) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations."" Initially, telecommunications companies such as Verizon were the targets of legal action against Patriot Act provisions. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses. The New York ruling makes it more likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will have to tackle the issue of privacy and settle the dispute over the the NSA program. For years, the courts have relied on a 1979 Supreme Court precedent that found privacy rights didn't extend to personal information people give to third-parties such as the phone companies, which store basic data on calls made. The secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has relied on that ruling to periodically reauthorize the NSA phone data program. But technology has come a long way since then; modern cell phones are in constant communication with phone towers and tell a lot more information about phone customers than old land line phones. And at least some justices may be ready to take on the issue again. Ruling last year in an unrelated case, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the 1979 standard may be ""ill suited to the digital age"" because people reveal a lot more information in seemingly mundane tasks. ""It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties,"" she wrote. CNN's Bill Mears and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: The ruling makes it likely the Supreme Court will have to tackle the issue of privacy .

"(CNN) -- The 2014 Golden Globes are in the books, and prognosticators will have plenty to work with as they try to predict the Oscar winners -- and, for that matter, the future of ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine."" Relive the Golden Globes' most fascinating moments on our blog . 1. Tina and Amy dazzled again. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who earned praise for their hosting of last year's Golden Globes, started off this year's edition where they left off: rattling off zinger after zinger. George Clooney? He ""would rather float into space and die rather than spend another minute with a woman close to his own age."" Meryl Streep? Her success proves there are still great roles for ""Meryl Streeps over 60."" Actresses having to appeal to impossible physical standards? Matthew McConaughey lost 45 pounds for ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" or ""what actresses call 'being in a movie.' "" The only downside of their hosting was there was much less of it than there could have been. Though the two popped up from time to time, after the opening segments they were primarily off stage (until Poehler won best actress in a TV comedy or musical series, anyway). Golden Globes: GIFs and best moments . 2. We have our Oscar front-runners. ""12 Years a Slave"" won best motion picture drama. ""American Hustle"" won best motion picture comedy or musical. ""Gravity"" won best director for Alfonso Cuaron. The rest of the possibilities -- ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" ""Captain Phillips,"" ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" ""Nebraska"" -- may get nominated for best picture, but they're even longer shots for the big prize than they were before the Globes. And best actress will likely boil down to a face-off between Cate Blanchett (""Blue Jasmine""), who won best actress in a drama, and Amy Adams (""American Hustle"") who took home the same prize for musical or comedy. Keep up to date with the winners using our Awards Tracker . 3. On the other hand, Matthew McConaughey? And ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine""? Though McConaughey has gotten terrific reviews for his performance in ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" he was seen as a dark horse behind Chiwetel Ejiofor (""12 Years"") and Robert Redford (""All is Lost""), not to mention perennial favorite Tom Hanks (""Captain Phillips""). But the Texas-born actor, who has given his acting career new life with such films as ""Magic Mike,"" ""Mud"" and a small but pivotal performance in ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" has put himself in the forefront of the best actor conversation. All right, all right, all right! And on the TV side, ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"" which has suffered from middling ratings, may have gotten new life itself with its Globe wins as best TV series comedy or musical and for star Andy Samberg. E! apologies for Michael J. Fox 'Fun Fact' during Golden Globes . 4. It's a long walk to the winner's circle. Some stars took what seemed like ages to get to the stage to accept their trophies. They have to push past well-wishers -- bussing a few of them, naturally -- and wind their way through the Beverly Hilton's many full tables. Perhaps next year the Hollywood Foreign Press Association can invest in a few Segways. Ronan Farrow disses estranged dad Woody Allen's Golden Globes tribute . 5. Red is the color. The red carpet was reflected in the gowns of many of the actresses.

"(InStyle.com) -- She may have charmed audiences in ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""Junebug,"" but Amy Adams's sweet demeanor belies a criminal history. ""I used to steal my older sister's pink-and-green Maybelline mascara,"" says Adams, 33. ""I see myself as optimistic, and I think that can be confused with being innocent and naïve."" Although the Colorado native, who appears this month in the movie ""Enchanted"" and in the upcoming ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" has ""outgrown petty theft,"" she says, she hasn't outgrown her love of mascara -- or any other beauty products. Spend time with the actress and she'll offer you a dab of her favorite lip balm (Benetint) and a sample of her tooth-whitening system (Go Smile). When it comes to makeup, she's more a giver than a taker these days. ""If I outgrow something, I like to share it. It's good to be my friend when I clean out my makeup bag!"" How skilled are you at doing your own makeup? It's a learning process. I can do a decent job, but I like to leave it to the professionals when it counts. When I first moved to L.A. I got a callback, and a producer said he'd like to see me with more makeup. But he told my agent that she might have to put it on ""because I didn't seem like the kind of girl who would know how."" And he was right! I had to go into the bathroom at my agency and have my agent do my makeup. Have you come a long way since then? I still keep it pretty simple, although I like getting dolled up to hang out with friends. Sometimes, if you need a pick-me-up, there's nothing better than a new lip gloss. At any given moment, I can have upwards of 10 glosses in my purse. And I am addicted to perfumes. I love Jo Malone's scents -- the Nectarine Blossom & Honey, the French Lime Blossom, and the Orange Blossom. I don't have a signature scent; I switch depending on my mood. Is there another product you are more faithful to? If I'm outdoors, I'm constantly reapplying sunscreen. My sister used to call me Fish-Belly Blue because I was so pale. I went to Italy this summer and decided I'd be a rebel and sit out in the sun wearing a sunscreen with a low SPF. The next day I woke up with a rash all over my body. My skin rejects the sun. I had a grown man at a water park once yell at me to get a tan. A water-park heckler? Me in a swimsuit -- that's a lot of pale skin! How do you take care of it? I get regular facials. I had some skin problems when I was starting to film ""Catch Me If You Can."" I had really dry skin. I went to Marion Simms at Skin Sense in L.A., and she got it under control. I've been going there since then for the standard facial. What do you do for your hair? Bumble and Bumble True Reds shampoo keeps the richness in it. I really like red, but I'm always open to change. I would love to cut my hair and try platinum -- Christina Aguilera blond. Harlow blond. Have you gone blond before? I've had red hair for the past four years. Before that, I never thought of being anything but blond. There was a definite shift in my life when I decided to go red. I tend to laugh a lot, and I can be really silly. I think when you have blond hair, people associate those behaviors with being flighty. With red hair, you're suddenly quirky. What is your quirkiest beauty tool? I love the classic Conair hot rollers. I put my makeup on, take them out, spray, then just shake my head and I'm ready. I think hot rollers are making a comeback! Anything on your wish list? I always wanted to be taller. [Adams is 5 feet, 5 inches.] I was a dancer, so I always admired that willowy effect. I still look at it with a sense of longing, but I fully accept I can't change it. I just walk tall. And wear wedges. Get her look . Makeup . To create Adams's smoky eyes, makeup artist Molly R. Stern pressed Shu Uemura in AI ($20; shuuemura-usa.com) on the eyelids. She neutralized the blue by blending it with taupe shadow, then used pearly green liner on the inside rims of the bottom lids. She applied beige lip pencil and finished with a slick of Cover Girl Wetslicks Fruit Spritzers in Guava Splash ($6; drugstore.com). Hair . To build Breck Girl bouncy waves, hairstylist Andy LeCompte set Adams's hair in pin curls for 20 minutes after winding 2-inch sections around a curling iron.

We got CNN's Wolf Blitzer, anchor of ""The Situation Room,"" to answer questions about being a journalist and to share tips on covering the perfect story. Blitzer is an Emmy Award-winning anchor for CNN and is also a recipient of the Peabody Award for his Hurricane Katrina coverage, the Alfred I. duPont Award for his coverage of the tsunami disaster in Southeast Asia and an Edward R. Murrow Award for CNN's September 11 coverage. See what he had to say below, and then apply some of his advice to your CNN iReport boot camp story! Being a journalist . Q: What and/or who inspired you to become a journalist? A: When I finished grad school, I sort of fell into journalism. Someone mentioned that there was an entry-level job at the Reuters News Agency. I applied, and, to my amazement, I got the job. Q: And when did you first decide you wanted to be a journalist? A: It took only a few weeks for me to catch the journalistic bug. I realized that I loved asking questions and filing reports. I had been a news junkie my whole life, even as a young boy growing up in Buffalo, New York, and now I was getting paid to follow the news. Picking a story to cover . Q: How do you know when a story is worth covering? A: My rule of thumb is that if I am interested or intrigued by something, others will be as well. Q: What's your favorite story of those you have covered? A: I have loved covering lots of stories. I don't have one favorite. Among my favorites: the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the apartheid regime in South Africa, all of the U.S. presidential elections over the years because I love politics. I love covering stories that have huge historic impacts. Q: Where are some good places to look for story ideas? A: I speak to a lot of people and go to a lot of websites looking for tips. Q: Where have you found your best stories? A: My best stories come from well-placed sources who point me in the right direction. Finding and talking with sources .

Q: What's your best advice for getting someone to speak on the record, and do you ever have to protect them? A: My best advice is simply to be honest with the sources. Q: In what circumstances, if at all, is it appropriate to keep a source's details off the record -- and is there such a thing? A: Some information is understandably very sensitive; anything that could lead to physical harm or death, for example, is something that I would keep off the record. We may be journalists, but we are also human beings. Q: Have you ever had trouble finding sources for a story? A: I have been very fortunate in developing excellent sources over the years. It comes with experience. Q: What types of sources are crucial for a good story? A: The best sources are the ones who are deeply involved in the stories and know a great deal about them.

A: My rule of thumb is to be polite but firm in asking the questions and trying to make sure I get the answers. Q: What is the one piece of advice you wish you were taught about interviewing that you had to learn on your own? A: The most important thing is to listen to the answer and follow up when appropriate. Q: How do you take notes and make sure you have the best quotes? A: The best thing is to record the interview so you can go back and check the quotes. Q: Do you know shorthand? A: No. But I can scribble quickly. Q: What are some things that could go wrong during an interview, and how do you prepare for such possibilities/steer things back on track? A: Occasionally, you will irritate the person and that person will want to end the interview. If that happens, you try to persuade that person to stick around for more questions. Editing your stories . Q: It's tough to cut down and/or critique your own writing. What advice do you have for doing that? A: Have someone else do the editing. My dad always said: ""Two heads are better than one."" Q: What is the most challenging thing about writing for you, and how do you overcome issues that come up?

"(CNN) -- Extended unemployment benefits will temporarily expire for thousands of Americans on Monday because the Senate went on its spring recess without approving a one-month deadline extension. The extension, which had bipartisan support, would have cost about $10 billion, but a lone Republican, Sen. Tom Coburn, said no until the costs are offset. The Oklahoma senator objected to a commonly used unanimous-consent agreement to pass the bill under emergency conditions, even if it increases the federal deficit. Coburn wants to eliminate additional government spending to pay for the bill. ""The legitimate debate is whether we borrow and steal from our kids or we get out of town and send the bill to our kids for something that we're going to consume today,"" Coburn said on the Senate floor. It's the second time a Republican has blocked a so-called ""emergency extension"" of jobless benefits. Kentucky Sen. Jim Bunning objected to adding to the deficit back in February. ""We can't do everything we'd like to do,"" Bunning said at the time. ""We don't have the money."" Coburn on Monday refuted the notion he single-handedly blocked the extension, noting that he voted to stay in session to work out the issue. ""Congress had several opportunities to extend these benefits in a fiscally-responsible manner before our Easter break but rejected all of them. It's time for Congress to do what's right for both the unemployed and future generations and do the hard work of paying for important priorities,"" he said in a statement. Bunning on Monday also pointed the finger at congressional Democrats for going on recess before agreeing to a solution that was fully paid for. ""I am disappointed that the Democrats continue to play political games to avoid paying for these benefits that are so important to the many struggling families across our nation who rely on them to make ends meet while they search for work. Clearly, the Democrats don't want to help the unemployed unless they can increase the deficit while they're doing it,"" he said in a statement. Asked whether President Obama believes that the benefits extension should be paid for, Lawrence Summers, one of Obama's top economic advisers, said, ""He believes that in an emergency, families who are depending on unemployment insurance to buy medicine for their kids should not have that unemployment insurance cut off."" ""We believe that we need to approach these issues in their totality, with a fiscal framework that assures that we are getting to a much lower budget deficit,"" Lawrence, the head of the National Economic Council, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" The unemployment benefits provision was a part of the Continuing Extension Act of 2010, which affects other programs, too. The Senate's inaction means lapses in funding for COBRA, Medicare payments to doctors and the National Flood Insurance Program, among other things. The Senate is expected to take up the measure after lawmakers return from recess the week of April 12.  Key Democrats said they hope to pass a retroactive extension, compensating the unemployed for a gap in funding. If approved, it would be the seventh time the deadline has been extended since June 2008. Which programs did Congress leave unfunded? For the meantime, Democrats are furious. Sen. Byron Dorgan represents North Dakota. At 4.1 percent, the state has the lowest unemployment rate in the country. ""There are a whole lot of people in this country that are unemployed, and if ever there was a need to extend unemployment insurance, it is now. We can't do that to the most vulnerable people in this country,"" he said. At least 212,000 Americans will be affected Monday. Alexander Mitiuriev, an unemployed aerospace engineer, said Coburn's argument that the nation's children will carry the burden doesn't resonate with him because his kids are being affected right now. ""This is my children. For right now, they are affected,"" he said. ""It makes no sense,"" he said, adding that his children need the money now. Clovia Cox, a personal trainer who is out of work, agreed with Mitiuriev, saying that the future is on the line today. ""Having people give up their future dreams and trying to save money for a better working car or better career or a better education -- that is the future. The future starts now. It's desperate now,"" she said. About 11.5 million people currently depend on jobless benefits. The average unemployment period lasts 32.1 weeks. Of those unemployed, a record 44.1 percent of have been jobless for 27 weeks or more. CNN's Ted Barrett and Kristi Keck and CNNMoney's Jennifer Liberto contributed to this report.","Bunning says Democrats are the ones who continue to ""play political games""

"Editor's note: Brandon Ancil is a digital producer and editor for CNN.com. Like many CNN iReporters, he shoots, edits and produces all of his content himself. Below are some tips to editing a video piece from start to finish. Read up, then give Ancil's advice a try in this week's iReport Boot Camp challenge. In the world of video production, it's not a stretch to say that video editors are easily overlooked. Last in line to get their hands on the material, the choices a video editor makes can drastically change the impact a video has. With the right style, tone and technique, an ordinary video can be transformed into a gripping video experience. And once you have the basic tools of how to edit, it's only a matter of time before you're editing like a pro. Review footage . The first step when editing is to get your footage onto your computer. The very next step should be to review it. Watching all of the video you have to work with, from beginning to end, will bring the story back to you. And while you're reviewing your footage, you should also be organizing it. Organization . All editors have their own system of organization. Some lay their clips out chronologically while others set their clips into scenes. First determine how you'd like to organize your clips and then make it happen. Luckily, all editing programs from Final Cut Pro to Windows Movie Maker have one basic organized layout. They include: a timeline (an area where footage can be laid down for review and cutting), a clip bin (an area where transferred clips can be labeled and organized for viewing) and a viewer (the video playback area of your editing program). Whether you're editing a small project or a large one, it's best to keep the elements in your bin well catalogued. Organization will save you time and stop an editor from being overwhelmed by the amount of available footage. At the beginning of an edit, I break down my video elements into three main groups: . B-roll: Any video footage that does not include interviews. SOTs: ""SOT"" or Sound On Tape, refers to interviews or specific audio for your story. Graphics: Extra elements that are created in pre- or post-production to enhance the story. Make it functional, then fancy . No matter how beautiful or beat-up the shots may be, video storytelling is at its core, storytelling. As an editor, your main responsibility should be to tell the story in the most responsible way. You do this by first arranging your audio from interviews, natural sound and/or a voiceover to create your storyline. Once that is done, you can then begin to add exciting visual elements to enhance the storytelling. Lead with action . Buck the notion that you save the best for last. In video, you've got to grab your viewer's attention and keep it the entire way through. Whether it's compelling video or sound, always lead with an active element that is both integral to the story and interesting to the viewer. Create pace and tension . There's nothing worse than a story that gives it all away in the beginning. As an editor, it's important to create a storyline with tension that builds to keep the viewer watching. If not, you've broken an unwritten promise to the viewer. Audio and music . Music can aid in building pace and tension in a story. Just remember a piece of music should not change the meaning or intent of the story. A way to check this is to simply watch the piece with the music playing -- and then watch it with the music muted. If you find your impression of the story as a whole has changed, revisit your music selection. A music track should complement your story, not compete with it. Also select your music carefully. Don't use trademarked music unless you have the license to do so. Try using music that's available in the public domain. Sites like PD Info can help you identity useable music. Make your edits count . As with shooting, there are many cardinal sins in editing. Among them: jump-cuts, splitting the axis and video effects or transitions. Jump-cut: A jump-cut occurs when an editor makes a cut that appears to have skipped or jumped forward. The easiest example to visualize is in an interview setting. If an editor cuts from one thought too quickly to the next without a camera movement or transition, the cut looks noticeably like it has jumped forward. A way to avoid this is to use ""b-roll"" to cover those cuts. Splitting the axis: Splitting the axis differs from a jump-cut because of its severity. Instead of little change, crossing the axis is a sudden shot change from one side of your subject to his or her opposite side. To better understand, imagine you're watching an interview. The person is facing the camera with most of their right side toward the camera. Suddenly, the camera angle changes, and you see the opposite side of the interviewee. You have crossed the axis - which is a visually jarring cut, and something that should be avoided at all costs. Video effects and/or transitions: When used effectively (and sparingly), these elements can aid in cleaning up a video. A white flash can help mitigate a jump cut, or a dip to black can add needed pacing to an emotional story. Restraint . The KISS acronym -- ""Keep It Simple and Straightforward"" has never let me down. Suppressing your desire to add in more elements can oftentimes be your best tool. This may mean eliminating useless transition effects, graphics or excessive shot changes. Finishing touches . After you've edited your piece, take the time to critically review the choices you've made in both story and video. A peer-review is a great tool. Showing your work to someone who hasn't seen it before will provide a fresh perspective on your piece. Listening to the person's feedback will help you fill in holes that you may not have noticed yourself. Tips learned the hard way . Save constantly. No one wants to redo their project. And backup your material. If you have enough space, either keep the footage on your camera or double up your material on another computer.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- From the halls of Congress to the shell-pocked streets of Libyan cities, intertwined themes rang clear Thursday: Leader Moammar Gadhafi is determined to prevail, and the opposition needs more training and allied air strikes to have a chance. ""Gadhafi will ""kill as many (people) as he must to crush the rebellion,"" Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee. The rebels, who were regrouping after several setbacks, pinned their hopes on more coalition air power, which will likely increase as weather improves. ""We want more to bring a speedy end to this,"" Col. Ahmed Omar Bani, an opposition spokesman, told CNN. ""A strike is not a strike unless it kills,"" he said. CIA operatives have been in Libya working with rebel leaders to try to reverse gains by loyalist forces, a U.S. intelligence source said. The United States, insisting it is now fulfilling more of a support role in the coalition, shifted in that direction as NATO took sole command of air operations in Libya. The ferocity of this month's fighting and Gadhafi's advantage in firepower was clearly evident in Misrata, which has seen snipers, significant casualties and destruction. A witness told CNN Thursday there ""is utter madness"" and Gadhafi's men are going door-to-door evicting and terrorizing people. ""I am afraid it will be one big massacre here in Misrata"" if the international forces ""do not do more,"" he said. CNN did not identify the witness for security reasons. Saddoun El-Misurati, a spokesman for the Libyan opposition in Misrata, described intense fighting and casualties in the city. ""We managed to get two shipments, so far, of badly needed medical supplies to the hospitals. But obviously we still need more supplies in dealing with the day-to-day casualties and the situation on the ground,"" he said. Gadhafi's military capabilities had been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned air strikes, U.S. officials have said. But the dictator's forces outnumber the rebels by about 10-to-1 in terms of armor and other ground forces, Mullen noted. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, also speaking before the House committee, warned that the Libyan rebels still need significant training and assistance. ""It's pretty much a pickup ballgame"" right now, he said. U.S. and British officials say no decision has been made about whether to arm the opposition. Dianne Feinstein, head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" she opposes doing that. The Democratic senator cited failures of such a move in other conflicts. Bani -- asked whether he is open to the idea of ground forces from outside Libya joining the rebels' effort -- responded that ""all options are open to us."" ""It has been very hard the past few days because the freedom forces have been facing heavy tanks and artillery weapons with very light weapons,"" the spokesman said. While some members of the Libyan military reportedly defected to join the opposition, the rebels include many volunteers who have not been trained. Over the weekend, CNN reported that rebels had taken al-Brega, Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad, and reached a town just east of Sirte. But in the past three days, opposition fighters have been pushed back eastward. CNN's Ben Wedeman, reporting Thursday from near al-Brega, said the rebels, armed with light mortars and machine guns, have displayed no strategy in their running battles with loyalist troops. Gates reiterated the Obama administration's promise that no U.S. ground forces will be used in Libya, telling committee members that the rebels had indicated they didn't want such an intervention. But the United States does have CIA personnel on the ground. A U.S. intelligence source said the CIA is operating in the country to help increase U.S. ""military and political understanding"" of the situation. A former counterterrorism official with knowledge of U.S. Libya policy said there is a presidential finding authorizing the CIA to conduct operations in support of U.S. policy in Libya, including assessing the opposition and determining their needs. Specific activities by CIA officers will be determined by conditions on the ground and would need further approval from the White House, the source said. A former senior intelligence official said officers ""might be advising [rebels] on how to target the adversary, how to use the weapons they have, reconnaissance and counter-surveillance."" Presidential findings are a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations. The CIA has had a presence in Libya for some time, a U.S. official told CNN earlier this month. ""The intelligence community is aggressively pursuing information on the ground,"" the official said. The CIA sent additional personnel to Libya to augment officers on the ground after the anti-government protests erupted, the official said, without giving details. CIA officers assisted with the rescue of one of two U.S. airmen whose fighter jet crashed in Libya on March 21, a knowledgeable U.S. source said. NATO emphasized Thursday that the U.N. resolution authorizing action in Libya precludes ""occupation forces."" NATO Adm. Giampaolo Di Paola, chairman of the NATO Military Committee, indicated that the presence of foreign intelligence personnel does not violate U.N. Security Council 1973, which authorized action in Libya. Rebel forces have been demanding an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42 years of rule in Libya. They have faced sustained attacks by a regime fighting to stay in power and portraying the opposition as terrorists backed by al Qaeda. Rebel forces have lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the al-Brega area, Bani said Wednesday. Ajdabiya, which is east of al-Brega, will be prepared as a ""defense point"" if the withdrawal continues farther east, he said. Amid the setbacks faced by rebels, a significant crack in Gadhafi's armor surfaced when Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa fled to London on Wednesday and told the government there that he has resigned, the British Foreign Office said. Koussa -- a former head of Libyan intelligence -- was a stalwart defender of the government as recently as a month ago. But in recent weeks his demeanor had visibly changed. At one recent media briefing, he kept his head down as he read a statement and left early. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Koussa had not been offered any immunity. Koussa's defection provides evidence ""that Gadhafi's regime ... is fragmented, under pressure and crumbling from within,"" said Hague, adding that Koussa is voluntarily speaking with officials in the United Kingdom. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Thursday that Koussa did not tell the government he planned to resign before he flew to Britain. Ibrahim said Koussa asked for sick leave and the government gave him permission to leave the country and receive intensive medical care. The government had another setback Thursday, with news that an official who was picked as Libyan ambassador to the United Nations has defected. A relative and an opposition leader said Thursday that former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki was in Cairo. CNN's Nic Robertson, Ben Wedeman, Reza Sayah, Dana Bash, Pam Benson, Tim Lister and Zain Verjee contributed to this report.","Sen. Dianne Feinstein opposes arming the rebels .

"(CNN) -- There were once seven words you couldn't say on television, as the late comedy icon George Carlin famously lampooned 40 years ago. Now it appears there are more than 500 words you shouldn't say on Twitter or Facebook unless you want to be flagged by the Department of Homeland Security. There is a surveillance program the agency quietly began in February 2011 to monitor social media, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center. Documents obtained only after the privacy organization filed a lawsuit to enforce its Freedom of Information Act request reveal that anything you post on social-media websites such as Twitter and Facebook could come under review by the Department of Homeland Security, or at least by General Dynamics, the military defense contractor hired to implement the surveillance program. Like the probes in the movie ""The Matrix,"" they are looking for ""Items of Interest,"" which in this case are words on a watch list that are considered ""bad."" So what words are of interest to them? Are they like the seven words that Carlin joked about not being able to say on television because they ""... will infect your soul, curve your spine and keep the country from winning the war."" (By the way, if Carlin tweeted these words today, he would get noticed because the word ""infection"" is part of the watch list.) No, Carlin's joke dealt with curse words, which are actually now heard nightly on cable TV. In contrast, the Department of Homeland Security is concerned with a broader range of words that you can say on television, or anywhere, usually without a problem. However, if you tweet or post these specific words on social-media websites, then you'll catch the attention of the security agency. The watch list includes hundreds of words and phrases that have been organized into certain categories: domestic security, HAZMAT, health concern, Southwest border violence, federal agencies, terrorism, weather/disaster/emergency, cybersecurity and Infrastructure security. Two questions jump out regarding this surveillance program. How effective is it? And more importantly, is this an invasion of our privacy? The effectiveness question is hard to answer. When you look at all the words on the watch list, it's hard to believe that any terrorist or criminal would tweet or post them unless they wanted to get caught. For example, the watch list contains words such as dirty bomb, hostage, al Qaeda and ammonium nitrate. What terrorist in his right mind would tweet, ""Looking for ammonium nitrate, please direct message me if you have leads?"" There are also terms under the category ""Southwest border violence"" that seem ridiculous, such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, meth lab and drug war. If a drug dealer mentioned on his Facebook wall, ""Great deal today on heroin and methamphetamine, and it's all organically made in my own meth lab,"" I would hope that people would turn that person in -- or at the very least, not ""like"" his post. But it's the long list of innocent words on the watch list that raises more concerns. Words such as subway, delays, infection, San Diego, cloud, pork, wave and Mexico are monitored. If you posted on Twitter, ""I'm going on vacation to San Diego, hope no clouds because want to catch some waves,"" your tweet would be considered suspicious because you used three words on the watch list. In the event that your Facebook or Twitter post is flagged, a further investigation could be triggered, and information could be shared with other government agencies. As a former attorney, I am fully aware that you have little grounds to claim that your postings on Facebook and Twitter have an expectation of privacy. Social media is almost the equivalent of speaking loudly at a crowded party -- people beyond your intended recipients will hear your words. However, putting the legality issues aside, we should be concerned the government is engaged in the wholesale monitoring of our social-media streams. This program is akin to the Chinese government's monitoring of the Internet. Our government must not emulate an authoritarian regime. We should reject the notion that tweeting words included in the watch list, such as San Diego or clouds, justifies monitoring our activities on social-media platforms. If we don't object now to the unfettered surveillance of our social-media communications, the next step could be the government's reading of our direct messages on Facebook and Twitter. Following that, the reading of our personal e-mails would not be far behind. Since 9/11, we have far too often willingly forfeited privacy in the name of security, be it the Patriot Act, the New York Police Department's spying of Muslim Americans, body-scanning machines, intrusive pat-downs at airports and who knows what else is out there that we have yet to find out about. If it were not for the Electronic Privacy Information Center's lawsuit, we would be unaware of the details of this latest program. Benjamin Franklin famously warned us, ""Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both."" The Department of Homeland Security's surveillance program -- and our acceptance of programs like it -- is just another step in the direction that Franklin so wisely cautioned us to guard against. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","The Department of Homeland Security reportedly is monitoring social-media websites .

"(CNN) -- Nothing about Melissa Huckaby, a Sunday school teacher at her grandfather's California church, would indicate she's capable of killing her daughter's 8-year-old friend as police allege, relatives say. Melissa Huckaby faces charges of kidnapping and murder in the death of 8-year-old Sandra Cantu. Huckaby, expected to be arraigned Tuesday in the death of Sandra Cantu, is a wonderful mother who is at ease with other children, relatives say. Cantu's body was found last week in a suitcase submerged in a pond. But they acknowledge her life was less than tranquil before moving into her grandparents' Tracy, California, home last year. They say she's had difficulties dealing with a divorce, and she's had legal problems, including bankruptcy and a theft conviction. ""She is a good, church-going girl, but she has had her challenges,"" California resident Cynthia Browning, Huckaby's great-aunt, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Huckaby, 28, was arrested on charges of murder and kidnapping late Friday, four days after the suitcase with Cantu's body was found at a dairy farm's pond in Tracy, not far from the church run by Huckaby's grandfather. Cantu was last seen alive March 27 in the Tracy mobile home park where she lived. It's the same park where Huckaby lives with her 5-year-old daughter and grandparents. The two children were close friends and played frequently, Tracy police said. Investigators believe the suitcase is Huckaby's and that she lied about it being missing, police said. Police Sgt. Tony Sheneman told reporters over the weekend that he didn't know the motive in the slaying, and he declined to say whether Huckaby confessed but said ""she revealed enough information that we had probable cause to arrest her."" On Sunday, Huckaby's relatives told reporters in Tracy they were shocked by the allegations against her. ""The information we've been given regarding the charges against [her] are completely out of character for her,"" said one man, who identified himself only as a relative. Another relative, also declining to give her name, said Huckaby ""is a fantastic mother, very loving."" Huckaby, who grew up in Orange County, California, moved in with her grandparents about eight months ago, according to the Contra Costa Times. She did so in part so that she'd have more time ""to take better care of her daughter, who ... gets sick a lot,"" Browning told the Chronicle. Huckaby divorced a few years ago and has had a hard time coping, her father, Brian Lawless of Orange County, told the Chronicle. She has fought depression, her relatives said, according to the newspaper. She also has faced legal difficulties. Citing court records, the Tracy Press reported she pleaded no contest January 9 to a felony charge of second-degree commercial burglary and a misdemeanor charge of property theft. A criminal complaint says she was jailed in Los Angeles County on a property theft conviction in 2006 and that she tried to steal from a store in November 2008. According to the complaint, she was on probation in San Joaquin County and was due back in court Friday. And she filed for bankruptcy in 2003, reporting credit card and medical debt, according to CNN affiliate KCRA-TV. Relatives said her only current job was the Sunday school teaching, according to the Chronicle. The allegations stunned a friend of Huckaby's from high school, Emily Glyer Fontes, according to the Orange County Register. Fontes said she recalled that Huckaby ""was almost like a mother"" to a baby girl that Huckaby's parents adopted while she was in high school. ""That's why this is so overwhelming to me,"" Fontes, who said she and Huckaby were on the school's dance team, told the Register. ""She was so wonderful with kids -- absolutely amazing. I feel so completely confused and so devastated about this. Everything I knew has been turned upside down."" Police have not said how Cantu died. The day she was last seen, she came home from school, kissed her mother and left to play with a friend who lives nearby, a family spokeswoman has said. Before her arrest, Huckaby told the Tracy Press that Cantu came by her home to see whether she could play with Huckaby's daughter, but Huckaby would not let her daughter play because she wanted her daughter to pick up her toys. Cantu left for another friend's house, Huckaby told the newspaper. Huckaby also told the Tracy Press that she owned the suitcase in which the child's body was found, but said she reported it missing the day before the body's discovery. She said it disappeared about the same time the child did. Sheneman told reporters after Huckaby's arrest that ""inconsistencies"" between that interview and statements Huckaby had made to police were one reason police re-interviewed her Friday night.","Melissa Huckaby faces murder charges in death of Sandra Cantu, 8 .

"Nyakagyezi, Uganda (CNN) -- Visiting his former village in rural Uganda, Jackson Kaguri was the epitome of a success story. He had escaped poverty, earned a college degree and moved to America, where he studied at an Ivy League school and planned to put a down payment on a house in Indiana. He'd often come back to Uganda, passing out school supplies to children. But on one particular trip home in 2001, he realized he had to do more. ""We woke up in the morning, and grandmothers had lined up all around the house, stretching way back. ... The whole village had gathered,"" Kaguri said. ""All these women walked miles and miles. It was huge."" UNICEF estimates that 1.2 million children in Uganda have lost one or both parents to AIDS-related illnesses, and Kaguri said it's often grandmothers who have to pick up the slack. ""You see the grandmothers over and over whose own children have died and left them,"" he said. ""Some of them have up to 14 (grandchildren) to raise in their homes. Sometimes the child has HIV/AIDS, they need medication. The grandmother needs food. They need a house. And nothing is there."" The grandmothers who gathered in Kaguri's childhood village begged Kaguri to help them. And he felt an obligation to give more than just pens, pencils and paper. ""These are women who had seen me grow up in the village,"" he said. ""They carried me when I was hurt, they prayed for me when I was away studying. What was I supposed to do?"" Knowing that education had been so key to his success, Kaguri and his wife decided to use their life savings to start a free school in the village. They purchased two acres of land and built the Nyaka School, brick by brick, with the help of local volunteers. When the school officially launched on January 2, 2003, 56 AIDS orphans were the first students. ""We provide them uniforms. We provide them pencils. We give them shoes,"" said Kaguri, 41. ""Everything we give ... is to try and eliminate as many obstacles as possible, so children can be successful and focus on education."" Early on, it was noticed that many children in the school were falling asleep because of hunger and malnutrition. So the school began providing students two meals a day. There is also a medical clinic on site. Meanwhile, Kaguri continued to raise money for the project while he worked full time in the United States. When he learned that a child had walked more than 30 miles to attend the school, he started a second school, the Kutamba School, in the village of Nyakishenyi. Today, between the two schools, there are 587 students -- kindergarten through 12th grade -- receiving a free education and health care. Nearly all of them have lost either one or both parents to AIDS-related illnesses. The issue hits especially close to home for Kaguri, who has lost his brother, one of his sisters and a 3-year-old nephew to the disease. Kaguri says he felt fortunate to have the financial means to help his brother's children financially, but in many similar cases, children end up homeless. ""Many of them are on the streets in Kampala eating from the dust bins,"" Kaguri said. ""You see all these street children because they have no one to help them."" It's these children Kaguri says he thinks about as he raises funds and awareness for his schools. ""(We) take care of nearly 600 children in school,"" he said. ""That leaves all these children who are walking around without an opportunity to get an education, to get health care, to get a meal to eat or even to get somebody to say, 'I love you.' "" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . Of the students at his schools, Kaguri estimates that 65% of them are being raised by their grandmothers, many of whom are often without adequate health care, finances or basic housing. So in 2008, he started a program that offers support and education to the nearly 7,000 area grandmothers who are raising their grandchildren. The program teaches the women practical life skills, offering advice on parenting, grief management, basic medical care, gardening and business development. Kaguri says that by giving grandmothers access to microfunds, allowing them to start small businesses and make money, more children have access to an education. And by giving seeds to the grandmothers to grow, more children have access to food. Grandmothers ""are the pillars in the society, holding the society together,"" he said. ""They are unsung heroes that people don't recognize."" Every grandmother in the program, Kaguri said, has received some form of training or household equipment to improve their life. And his organization has also opened a library, started a gardening program and installed a clean-water system to benefit the entire village. Kaguri, whose organization is based in Michigan and is funded by individual donations and private foundations, spends much of his time fundraising, speaking and raising awareness. He travels to Uganda about three times a year. He hopes this younger generation will lift the country out of poverty and create a better future for their families and communities. He says he dreams about building a school in every district in Uganda. ""I want to be an uncle for many so we can create other children who would be successful and do great things,"" he said. ""It's giving them a hand up, just holding somebody's hand, trying to get (them) out of the pigeonhole they are in. ... ""I feel humbled looking in the faces of the children smiling, focused on what their dreams are going to be."" Want to get involved?

"La Veta, Colorado (CNN) -- The crop has been harvested, and Diane Irwin's secret technique paid off. ""Every morning I would go out and talk to my girls,"" she said, ""pray over them and ask them to provide good medicine."" Her ""girls"" are marijuana plants destined for her son Jason's medical marijuana dispensary in Denver. At 48, she has just wrapped up her first season as a pot farmer. Her 62 plants yielded 13 pounds. Irwin spent most of her life as a hairdresser and salon owner in a Denver suburb. ""I was into makeup and high-heeled shoes and fancy clothes and working -- a lot,"" she said. ""I sold my salon and moved down to the country. I wanted a change of pace."" While Mom was looking for a midlife career change, her son was building a medical marijuana business, legal in Colorado since 2000. Diane Irwin loaned him $10,000 from the sale of her salon, and he opened Highland Health, a dispensary where patients who have been certified by the state can buy marijuana. Jason Irwin concedes he began his marijuana enterprise on the wrong side of the law, ""just getting cheap pounds and flipping them to my friends,"" he said. He was working full time as an arborist and dealing pot on the side when he saw an opportunity to take his business aboveboard. In 2008, he received state approval to open his dispensary. In March, he got a patient's card, citing chronic pain after a fender-bender. He smokes marijuana often. The medical marijuana business has boomed in Denver during the past year. Jason Irwin's dispensary was in place early, building clientele long before many of the newcomers arrived. He has about 200 regular patients, he said, and another 500 who come by from time to time. He employs four ""bud tenders"" and said he grosses about $5,000 a day. But it's not always easy to keep the pot in stock. Though the dispensaries are legal in Colorado, the laws are vague about growing cannabis. Legislators want to clarify the regulations, but until then, the dispensaries are getting their marijuana through unconventional routes. ""The connections are underground. They're not mainstream at all,"" Jason Irwin said. ""We can't call the growers union. There is no such thing. ""Instead of placing your order through a typical system ... you get a dude who comes down from the mountains and slaps a duffle bag on your desk. It's full of weed, and he's like 'Here, pick what you want. Do you want any?' And you've got to dig through it, inspect it for yourself, make sure it looks kosher, weigh it, pay thousands of dollars. It's all cash at this point."" See the different ways to take marijuana . Jason Irwin wanted to see those thousands of dollars stay in the family instead of going to the mountain dudes. Enter Mom. ""He called me one day and he said, 'Mom, I think we should buy this land' and 'How do you feel about growing medical marijuana?' And I said, 'OK.' It was just a faith thing."" Jason Irwin bought 37 acres in rural southern Colorado, tucked up against the Greenhorn Mountains. That's where his mom's new life began. In June, they paid $3,000 for two greenhouses, supplies and marijuana seedlings. Diane Irwin lived in an old camper and tended the plants. ""It was like an Outward Bound course for me,"" she said. ""Living off the grid, roughing it. We didn't have heat. We didn't have running water. We didn't have electricity most of the time. The batteries were always going dead. The greenhouse blew away a couple of times."" But at least she had company: First-time marijuana farmers occupy the plots of land on both sides of the Irwin operation. The trio formed an ad hoc collective, helping each other and learning from their mistakes. They spent their days tending to their plants and their evenings grilling food along a nearby river. One of the trio's concerns was security. Their greenhouses are visible from the road and they worry about being robbed or hassled by police. So far they have had no trouble, but if one grower needs to go into town for supplies, the others keep a watchful eye. By early November, the plants were ready to harvest. The Irwins filled several SUVs and pickup trucks with their crop and moved to a house they rented in nearby La Veta. A closet in the house is filled with marijuana that is drying out. The radio is set to NPR as Diane Irwin's fellow farmers trim the stems and leaves off the plants. The leftover twigs are run through a screen to form a powder that is packed by hand to form hashish. With only a few pounds left to process, Diane Irwin is already looking forward to next year. She hopes to triple their harvest. ""I'm in for the long haul. I really do feel like we're pioneers bringing new life to medical marijuana,"" she said. Diane Irwin got her patient card in May before starting the farm, also citing chronic pain. She rarely uses medical marijuana. Jason Irwin said that until the state better defines its law, he thinks it's wise for everyone in the business to have a patient card in case authorities question them while in possession of marijuana. Colorado is one of 14 states that has legalized medical marijuana. Federal law still bans its use. But the Justice Department recently announced it would no longer seek to prosecute people using, prescribing or distributing marijuana for medical purposes as long as they're in compliance with local laws. Jason Irwin wants to expand his operation based on the models of the two businesses he most admires: Whole Foods and Starbucks. ""We hope to develop a business model that proves to be successful, that we can expand upon, hopefully to other states and communities, become like a really reliable consistent supplier of safe, tested cannabis,"" he said. For Diane Irwin, her new life in business with her son hasn't quite set in. ""It wasn't something I ever dreamed I would be involved in, "" she said. When her son was growing up, she adds, ""I used to bust him all the time for marijuana. I used to flush it down the toilet.""","Diane Irwin sold her hair salon so she and her son could begin a marijuana-growing operation .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A group of experts from around the world will Thursday hold a first of its kind conference on global catastrophic risks. Some experts say humans will merge with machines before the end of this century. They will discuss what should be done to prevent these risks from becoming realities that could lead to the end of human life on earth as we know it. Speakers at the four-day event at Oxford University in Britain will talk about topics including nuclear terrorism and what to do if a large asteroid were to be on a collision course with our planet. On the final day of the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference experts will focus on what could be the unintended consequences of new technologies, such as superintelligent machines that, if ill-conceived, might cause the demise of Homo sapiens. ""Any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful,"" said Dr. Nick Bostrom, director of Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, host of the symposium. ""If we get something wrong, you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species."" Bostrom is a philosopher and a leading thinker of transhumanism -- a movement that advocates not only the study of the potential threats and promises that future technologies could pose to human life but also the ways in which emergent technologies could be used to make the very act of living better. ""We want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that,"" Bostrom told CNN. Transhumanists, according to Bostrom, anticipate a coming era where biotechnology, molecular nanotechnologies, artificial intelligence and other new types of cognitive tools will be used to amplify our intellectual capacity, improve our physical capabilities and even enhance our emotional well-being. The end result would be a new form of ""posthuman"" life with beings that possess qualities and skills so exceedingly advanced they no longer can be classified simply as humans. ""We will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well,"" Bostrom told CNN. ""The changes will be faster and more profound than the very, very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution."" Bostrom declined to try to predict an exact time frame when this revolutionary biotechnological metamorphosis might occur. ""Maybe it will take eight years or 200 years,"" he said. ""It is very hard to predict."" Other experts are already getting ready for what they say could be a radical transformation of the human race in as little as two decades. ""This will happen faster than people realize,"" said Dr. Ray Kurzweil, an inventor and futurist who calculates technology trends using what he calls the law of accelerating returns, a mathematical concept that measures the exponential growth of technological evolution. In the 1980s Kurzweil predicted that a tiny handheld device would be invented sometime early in the 21st century allowing blind people to read documents from anywhere at anytime -- earlier this year such a device was publicly unveiled. He also anticipated the explosive growth of the Internet in the 1990s. Now Kurzweil is predicting the impending arrival of something called the Singularity, which he defines in his book on the subject as ""the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology, resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots."" ""There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality,"" he writes. Singularity will approach at an accelerating rate as human-created technologies become exponentially smaller and increasingly powerful and as fields such as biology and medicine are understood more and more in terms of information processes that can be simulated with computers. By the 2030s, Kurzweil tells CNN, humans will become more non-biological than biological, capable of uploading our minds onto the Internet, living in various virtual worlds and even avoiding aging and evading death. In the 2040s, Kurzweil predicts non-biological intelligence will be billions of times better than the biological intelligence humans have today, possibly rendering our present brains as obsolete. ""Our brains are a million times slower than electronics,"" said Kurzweil. ""We will increasingly become software entities if you go out enough decades."" This movement towards the merger of man and machine, according to Kurzweil, is already starting to happen and is most visible in the field of biotechnology. As scientists gain deeper insights into the genetic processes that underlie life, they are able to effectively reprogram human biology through the development of new forms of gene therapies and medications capable of turning on or off enzymes and RNA interference, or gene silencing. ""Biology and health and medicine used to be hit or miss,"" said Kurzweil. ""It wasn't based on any coherent theory about how it works."" The emerging biotechnology revolution will lead to at least a thousand new drugs that could do anything from slow down the process of aging to reverse the onset of diseases, like heart disease and cancer, Kurzweil said. By 2020, Kurzweil predicts a second revolution in the area of nanotechnology. According to his calculations, it is already showing signs of exponential growth as scientists begin test first generation nanobots that can cure Type 1 diabetes in rats or heal spinal cord injuries in mice. One scientist is developing something called a respirocyte -- a robotic red blood cell that, if injected into the bloodstream, would allow humans to do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath or sit at the bottom of a swimming pool for hours at a time. Other researchers are developing nanoparticles that can locate tumors and one day possibly even eradicate them. And some Parkinson's patients now have pea-sized computers implanted in their brains that replace neurons destroyed by the disease -- new software can be downloaded to the mini computers from outside the human body. ""Nanotechnology will not just be used to reprogram but to transcend biology and go beyond its limitations by merging with non-biological systems,"" Kurzweil told CNN. ""If we rebuild biological systems with nanotechnology, we can go beyond its limits."" The final revolution leading to the advent of Singularity will be the creation of artificial intelligence, or superintelligence, which, according to Kurzweil, could be capable of solving many of our biggest threats, like environmental destruction, poverty and disease. ""A more intelligent process will inherently outcompete one that is less intelligent, making intelligence the most powerful force in the universe,"" writes Kurzweil. Yet the invention of so many high-powered technologies and the possibility of merging these new technologies with humans may pose both peril and promise for the future of mankind. ""I think there are grave dangers,"" said Kurzweil. ""Technology has always been a double-edged sword."" .................................................................................... Do you think technology will allow humans to transcend biology in the future? Would you be comfortable with altering your biology? Should humans try to reprogram their genetics? What do you think the future looks like for mankind and machines? Share your thoughts in the Sound Off box below.","Nick Bostrom says technology will let humans manipulate their own biology .

"(CNN) -- In what has become a dire and politically explosive situation at the border that includes droves of unaccompanied young border-crossers, overcrowded holding facilities, angry protesters and finger-pointing politicians, Washington struggles to get the situation under control. Politicians, however, easily point fingers of blame. On Sunday, politicians from both sides of the political aisle said President Barack Obama is not doing enough to stem the influx of immigrants -- some young children -- from coming to the United States. Obama to blame . Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, who represents the district where the immigrants are crossing the Rio Grande Valley at the southernmost tip of the Longhorn State, said the Obama administration is ""one step behind."" ""They should have seen this a long time ago, because we saw those numbers increasing,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" referring to the rise of undocumented immigrants across the border in recent years. Cuellar said that in 2009, about 6,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border, which jumped to 25,000 in 2013. (The Los Angeles Times estimated 39,000 children crossed last year.) But just in May, Cuellar said the number exploded to 9,700 unaccompanied children who unlawfully crossed the border. Opinion: The 'i-word' is un-American . Up to 80,000 children are expected this year, most coming from Central America. ""They knew this was happening a year ago, last year. And ... they're not reacting fast enough at this time, in my personal opinion,"" Cuellar said. Cuellar has been putting pressure on the administration to more aggressively address the issue, but his blunt remarks on national television Sunday reveals the level of frustration he has as his district is the entry point for many. He says the drug cartels are in part to blame and at an average of $5,000 per person are making hundreds of millions of dollars shuttling mothers with children and unaccompanied children into the United States. Like those children, I too fled Central America . Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry also blasted the President for what he calls his lack of engagement. Perry said he sent the administration a letter in 2012 outlining the rise of unaccompanied children crossing into Texas. He even went so far, again, to say that Obama might be culpable. ""You are either inept or you have some ulterior motive of which you are functioning from."" Perry's remark didn't go quite as far as a statement he made on Fox News in June when he said, ""I hate to be conspiratorial,"" before he floated a conspiracy theory, ""but I mean how do you move that many people from Central America across Mexico and then into the United States without there being a fairly coordinated effort?"" Perry's tone, however, was a change from just last week when he testified at a congressionally led hearing in McAllen, Texas, near the Mexico border. ""I'm tired of pointing fingers and blaming people,"" he said at the hearing. ""I hope what we can do is come up with some solutions here."" Perry, who is contemplating another run at the Republican presidential nomination, on Sunday said Obama has caused the situation. ""It is a failure of diplomacy. It is a failure of leadership,"" he said. But Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, defended the President, saying he ""understands what needs to be done."" He said Republicans need to look in the mirror when they issue blame. ""They had the opportunity for one solid year to call the Immigration Reform Bill. And yet they refused to,"" he said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a main proponent of the comprehensive immigration reform that passed the Senate but has been stalled in the Republican-led House, said the situation ""breaks my heart"" because it hurts any chance there was of completing work on the bill any time soon. What can be done . The administration says it is working ""within the confines of the law"" to address the crisis, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said. ""There are a number of things that the President and I, within the confines of the law, can do to fix the broken immigration system, and we will,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" He said the administration's actions include speeding up deportation for the adult immigrants. Opinion: GOP left Obama no choice but to act on immigration . But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, also a proponent of immigration reform, said the children must be sent back. ""If you don't, you're going to incentivize people throughout that part of the world to keep sending their children here,"" he said on ""Face the Nation."" The administration's options are somewhat limited. A 2008 human trafficking law says children immigrants from Central America cannot be immediately returned to their country of origin and must be cared for humanely. The children are transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for finding relatives in the United States with whom the children can stay. The youths are given immigration court dates but most don't appear, adding to the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Cuellar said the law ""needs to be changed at this time."" Obama has asked Congress to change the law but Congress' path forward is unclear. Perry, however, refused to indicate a law signed by Republican President George W. Bush was part of the problem. He focused his demands on border security, which is the standard Republican talking point on immigration reform. He said he's only worried about one law: ""The Constitution requires the United States to secure the border. And we're not doing that."" In response to Customs and Border Enforcement Commissioner, Gil Kerlikowske, saying he ""is confident"" the border patrol has the resources after the deployment of more than 250 additional agents recently, Perry said maintained his insistence that lax border security is the problem. He is ""absolutely and totally wrong,"" Perry said, noting that Texas has seven agents per mile compared with 15 per mile along other parts of the border. Showdown over immigration: ""This is an invasion' CNN's Ashley Killough and Greg Clary contributed to this report.","Texas Gov. Rick Perry said President Obama has an ""ulterior motive""

King hosted ""Larry King Live"" on CNN for 25 years. He now anchors specials on the network several times a year and is gearing up to start his stand-up comedy tour soon. CNN.com asked Larry King what he misses most about doing a nightly show. ""Doing it when a major event occurs,"" King said. ""When Osama bin Laden gets shot, you want to get in and do the show. Or Japan, or Gadhafi."" What doesn't King miss? ""I don't miss the tabloid elements. I don't miss Paris Hilton. Some people have an interest in that stuff, and I did a professional job when I did it. For example, I had no interest in the royals. I do miss major stuff.""

I would have loved to have interviewed Harry Truman when I was in radio."" Which historical figures would he have liked to interview? ""There would be a proviso: Do they know what's happened since they've been gone?

"(CNN)  -- While the Android mobile operating system is free, the smartphones and tablets that use it have generally been rather pricey and thus out of reach for many consumers. But now, Android is getting more accessible to typical consumers -- both in terms of usability and (more importantly) price. At last week's CTIA mobile technology conference and expo in San Francisco, California, several vendors introduced simpler, less costly cell phones that run Android -- all under $150 (after rebate), and some as cheap as $50. Some carriers have already revealed prices for data plans for these phones, at a cost significantly less than what smartphone users typically pay per month. The phones don't necessarily offer the same speed and performance as higher-end smartphones. But this is where the line between feature phones and smartphones is blurring. For example: . LG Optimus . Sprint and T-Mobile are launching versions of this phone, which is basically a low-cost starter smartphone. It has a 3.2-inch capacitive touch screen (one that responds to human fingers), a 3.2-megapixel camera (with video capture), microSD expandable storage (a 2 GB card comes standard, but the phone supports cards up to 32 GB), and the latest version of Android (2.2 ""Froyo""). Sprint plans to offer the Optimus starting October 31 for $49.99 -- after a $100 mail-in rebate and with a two-year contract that could cost about $60 a month. That's not quite as affordable as the flat $40-a-month ""for everything"" offer from discount carrier MetroPCS, but it's a lot less expensive than a Droid 2 or an iPhone. T-Mobile has not yet given a price for its Optimus phone but expects to release it for the holiday season. Samsung Transform . This slider-style device has a full QWERTY keyboard, a form factor that appeals to many feature phone and BlackBerry users but also is reminiscent of the EPIC 4G smartphone. It has a 480 x 320-pixel touch screen display, front- and back-facing cameras for video chat, up to 32 GB of microSD storage and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capability. It's running Android 2.1 -- not the latest version -- but will support most Android apps, widgets and services. According to Android Central, Sprint began selling the Transform on October 10 for $149.99, after a $100 mail-in rebate and with a new two-year service agreement. Sanyo Zio . This phone (which actually is manufactured by Kyocera) will be offered by Sprint for Zio for $99.99, with a new two-year service agreement and after a $100 mail-in rebate. It features a 3.5-inch WVGA touch screen, 3.2-megapixel camera and 30-frame-per-second video. Motorola Flipout, Flipside and Bravo . This trio of midrange Android phones is coming from AT&T. The Flipout is due out October 17, and the other two around the holidays. The Flipout has a pivoting QWERTY keyboard and will cost only about $80. The Flipside costs about $100 and has a slide QWERTY keyboard and 3.1-inch HVGA screen. The Bravo will cost about $130 and comes with a 3.7-inch WVGA screen, 800 MHz processor and 3-megapixel camera. (All prices are after rebates, and with a two-year contract.) RCR Wireless reports, ""All three devices require a data package beginning at $15 per month as well as qualify for an early termination fee of up to $325."" In the October 7 episode of The Cell Phone Junkie podcast, host Mickey Papillon and Dieter Bohn from Smartphone Experts discussed the pros and cons of several lower-end Android feature phones shown at the CTIA conference. Papillon and Bohn also discussed the new Sprint ID service for Android phones, which debuted at CTIA. Through partnerships with content providers like Yahoo and Electronic Arts, Sprint is selling prepackaged sets of apps, ringtones, widgets, wallpaper and more for its Android phones. ""The idea is that it's a pain for many people to figure out how to customize your Android phone,"" Bohn said. ""Yes, it's bloatware -- but it's a place to start and you at least get to pick which bloatware you want.""","Vendors at CTIA conference introduce phones all under $150, some as cheap as $50 .

"WASILLA, Alaska (CNN) -- It was the night before Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was to accept the Republican vice presidential nomination in a nationally televised speech, and Becky Moore couldn't sleep a wink. Dr. Curt Menard, Gov. Sarah Palin's family friend and childhood dentist, looks over her high school yearbook. She paced around her room and prayed before sending Palin an e-mail wishing her good luck. ""I was so nervous for her,"" said Moore, a dietitian who lives in Palin's hometown of Wasilla. ""I felt like she was my relative, like she was about to prove herself to the country."" As much as Moore was hoping for the best, there was a part of her that didn't want to share her governor and former mayor with the lower 48, a term Alaskans use to refer to their distant countrymen with a mix of playfulness and disdain. ""No matter what happens, we win. If she becomes vice president, the rest of the country will see what a great leader she is. If she loses, we get her back,"" Moore said. The night after Palin's speech, Moore and friends from her book club gathered at Wasilla's Pandemonium bookstore to discuss the Jeffrey Eugenides novel ""Middlesex."" But instead, the conversation centered on the poise and bravura with which Palin explained her views on resource development -- another Alaska term for oil and gas drilling -- family values, fighting corruption and reducing the role of government in private lives.  Watch why some say Palin may overshadow Sen. John McCain » . ""As a longtime Alaskan, she makes me proud. She's sophisticated and intelligent. She can wear bunny boots and high heels and be comfortable in both,"" said Paula Esche, a retired teacher who moved to Alaska from Wisconsin in 1963. Indeed, with each proverbial crack Palin has made in Alaska's political landscape, the story of her rise from hometown girl to political upshot has been retold over and over again in the Alaskan press and some national publications, including Vogue. iReport.com: What do you think of Sarah Palin? To many, Palin's iconic status is well-deserved, considering that the high school basketball star, former beauty queen and television journalist rose from Wasilla City Council member to Alaska's first female governor in less than 14 years.  See photos of Palin and her family » . In Wasilla, a railroad town nestled among the mountains of south-central Alaska, she has earned a reputation for pursuing agendas with such doggedness that critics and supporters alike are compelled to acknowledge her fighting spirit. Palin's family moved to Alaska in 1964, when her father took a teaching job in Skagway. She was 2 months old. Her parents settled in Wasilla a few years later. Family friend and Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Curt Menard said he would have never guessed that Palin's tenacity would bring her this far. Nevertheless, he is not entirely surprised by her success. ""She has always gone after what she wants with great intensity and careful judgment. She works for what she feels is right,"" said Menard, who is willing to take some credit for Palin's winning smile as her childhood dentist. A table in Menard's sunroom is littered with family photos and high school yearbooks that bear testament to the local folklore surrounding Palin. ""We did a lot of hunting and hiking together when the kids were little,"" said Menard, gesturing to a picture of Palin as a young teen with her sister and Menard's sons, surrounded by moose carcasses in a room for curing big game. Menard's collection of Wasilla High School yearbooks contains pictures of Palin on the honor society, student council, cross-country team and, most notably, as co-captain and point guard of the 1982 championship basketball team. In high school, Palin also met her future husband, Todd, who moved to Wasilla in his senior year. In a story that has also charmed its way into the hearts of Palin's constituents, they married at the courthouse in nearby Palmer in 1988 under the eyes of two witnesses they pulled from a nearby senior center. Palin entered local politics as a Wasilla City Council member in 1992, serving two terms before she campaigned against incumbent Mayor John Stein on a platform of fiscal responsibility and pledges to break up the ""good old boys"" network. During her mayoral campaign, many residents of Wasilla fondly recall that she knocked on doors to introduce herself and talk about their concerns. After becoming mayor, she often held community forums in coffeehouses. Within her administration, however, controversy flared up. After she took office in November 1996, she asked for letters of resignation from six department heads based on allegations that they were still supporting the former mayor. She also fired Police Chief Irl Stambaugh, who unsuccessfully sued her for wrongful termination, according to court records. Though many favored her no-nonsense attitude and open door policy, Wasilla substitute teacher Anne Kilkenny compared the atmosphere surrounding Palin to a popularity contest. ""I found the informal manner in which she ran City Council meetings had the flavor of turning city business into a fan club,"" said Kilkenny, a registered Democrat who moved to Wasilla from Seattle, Washington, in 1981. This weekend, Kilkenny, one of the few identifiable Palin critics in Wasilla, wrote an e-mail to friends criticizing Palin's track record that rapidly spread to blogs and Web sites. ""Everybody likes her because she's a real nice person. She's always been nice to me and everyone in town,"" Kilkenny told CNN.com. ""I wrote my message in the spirit of providing complete and accurate information. I'm not angry or jealous."" Praise and criticism followed Palin's ascendance to the governor's office after she won the state Republican primary against incumbent Gov. Frank Murkowski and took the general election in 2006. Earlier this year, when Palin signed off on a contract for a Canadian company to construct a gas line linking Alaska with the lower 48, she earned accolades from Alaskans who favor the development of natural resources. Others, however, said they believe Palin rushed the application process in an effort to win over voters. ""We're giving away finite resources when we should be trying to get the maximum value for them,"" said Jay Cross, a retired Alaska Guardsman who is a volunteer for Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama's campaign. ""Why the rush to create a pipeline that's not going to Alaska tidewaters and creating jobs for Alaskans?"" For those without strong political allegiances, the mere presence of an Alaskan on a major party ticket is enough to raise interest. ""I just think it's cool that someone from a small town like Wasilla can get as far as being nominated for vice president of the United States,"" said T.J. Montañez, 21. ""Maybe now the lower 48 will stop thinking we all live in igloos.""","Gov. Sarah Palin's family moved to Alaska in 1964, when she was 2 months old .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ben Folds didn't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it. Ben Folds was so impressed by a cappella groups' performances of his songs, he made a record with them. The singer-songwriter says he was beyond impressed when he stumbled across videos of university a cappella groups singing covers of his songs on YouTube. ""I was really moved,"" he says. ""I thought it was better than what I had done when I first heard it. That's how it struck me because it was so fresh."" And so an idea was born: Folds would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers. The North Carolina native picked 15 ensembles from 250 submissions for ""Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!"" (Epic), which came out Tuesday. And to give the music a ""field recording"" feel, he kept the process simple: Each performance was recorded using six wide-range microphones, and most of the groups got it down in one or two takes. ""It's a completely different point of view,"" says Folds, 42, of the students' renderings of his tunes. ""They're not signed singers and artists that have their egos to contend with. And sometimes they're not thinking about the song that much, which I think is kind of cool."" But not wanting to have the thunder completely stolen from him (and probably to entice his loyal fans to shell out for the album) Folds sings two a cappella tracks himself: ""Boxing"" from his Ben Folds Five days, and ""Effington"" from his 2008 solo album ""Way To Normal."" ""It was really difficult because we were doing my tracks from the bottom up,"" he says. ""We didn't have a bunch of people to work with and I just about gave up."" Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release, why being married four times isn't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Is this the one and only Ben Folds greatest hits album? Ben Folds: I think it naturally kind of is. I mean I was looking for something like that -- to possibly do a live orchestral album where the best material would kind of float to the top. But then again, someone's going to want to release a greatest hits soon, so this is the other greatest hits. CNN: Did you learn anything from the students? Folds: Yeah. I relearned a lot of stuff. ... This is all so old school. I mean these guys, they'd just do a live take and they just don't know that the pros don't do it that way. I mean, professional singers are a nightmare. You've gotta tune every syllable, they have to do it 10,000 times. These guys just did it. CNN: And you went around each campus to record each track? Folds: We kept them in what I would say is their natural habitat. I was really into the field recording idea. When you start messing with it and putting everyone on separate tracks you've lost the event and you've gained some sense of maybe perfection, but when it comes to the human voice, even-tempered piano tuning sounds incorrect to me. I think that people have a natural tuning mechanism. CNN: You've always been very Internet savvy. You've embraced MySpace. Do you Twitter? Folds: I'm not sure what that is. There's always something new. I think that my fans knew how to use computers before most people's fans. I remember when everybody was talking about the possibility of downloading, and I was already having kids walk up with CDs they had burned for me to sign. This was like 1999. I was signing burned CDs more than I was signing my own. So I think they get it. CNN: Why did you decide to leak a fake version of your 2008 album ""Way To Normal?"" Folds: Well, I think that we get very uptight when it comes time to record because there's a process, an imminent process that has to do with just selling the record, mostly. And it also has to do with people's general take on music and how it's framed. I felt if something went out that was a joke and it was riding on the press of a new album, that we would be forced to go in and do something so quickly that we couldn't monitor ourselves. So while I thought it was funny, I really liked the idea of going into the studio and making six songs in one day. So we wrote and recorded six songs in a day, mixed that day while we played our gig that night. And then it was mastered the next day. And then we leaked it the third day. So in three days we wrote, recorded, mixed, mastered, distributed and did press on an album. I think things were kind of cool. CNN: You've been married four times. Is that helpful for singer-songwriter purposes? I mean, that's a lot of drama. Folds: Well, it wasn't a lot of drama, really. ... Everyone's life is different and I think the pace at which I've lived and the way that I tend to take a risk all contributes to the way that I write. ... If you've got kids it is a drama. But it's the kind of drama you want to not write a song about. Because one, the kids will hear it and secondly, I don't like country music. CNN: How has having kids changed your outlook on music? Folds: I have to work more quickly and more efficiently. CNN: Who are you listening to at the moment? Folds: I'm in a habit of buying old 78 [rpm] records and I've got a little record player I'm carrying with me. CNN: That's heavy. Folds: Yeah, that's heavy, dude. CNN: I meant physically heavy -- to carry around a record player. Folds: Oh, that too. I wouldn't know about that with my (jokingly flexes muscles) -- it doesn't really occur to me, those things.","Ben Folds' new album consists of a cappella groups doing Folds songs .

"(CNN) -- The greatest in an illustrious lineage of Cuban fighters, Savon dominated the amateur heavyweight division between winning his first world championship in 1986 and claiming his third Olympic gold medal in 2000. Savon: Fidel Castro's favorite sportsman. Savon's final fight, in Sydney aged 33, was also one of his toughest. By the end he was bleeding badly from a cut underneath his eye, yet he still out-scored Russian opponent Sultan Ahmed Ibragimov 21-13. Raising a national flag above his head -- he had been given it personally by Fidel Castro before leaving for Australia -- he dedicated his success to the people of Cuba. By winning his third gold medal, Savon also emulated the achievement of compatriot Tefilo Stevenson, who dominated the super heavyweight division between 1972 and 1980. The pair are the only two fighters to win the same division at three Olympics. Savon was arguably a better fighter. He would probably have won gold in Seoul in 1988 as well, had Cuba not boycotted the Games. And his run of six straight amateur world championships was only ended in 1999 when the entire Cuban team walked out in protest at alleged refereeing injustices. Crushing win . In Barcelona in 1992, Savon had earned his first Olympic gold with a crushing 14-1 win against Nigeria's David Izonritel. Four years later in Atlanta, he scored another emphatic victory, pummelling David Defiagbon of Canada 20-2. With amateur boxing's age limit of 34, Savon retired after Sydney to become coach of the Cuban national team. What would Savon have achieved if he had abandoned the amateur ranks? The offers were certainly there: Don King reputedly offered him $10 million to fight professionally. Many experts argue that Savon could have been as dominant as another former Olympic champion -- Cassius Clay. Yet, fittingly for a great Olympian, Savon has remained defiantly amateur and an outspoken critic of professional boxing's casino culture. ""I never would have traded the love and affection of my people for all the millions in the world,"" he said.","Olympic record: 3 gold medals .

"(CNN) -- Posters portraying President Obama as a witch doctor may be racist, organizers of Tea Party protests say, but they reflect anger about where he is leading the country. A Tea Party rally protester holds a sign with President Obama depicted as a witch doctor. The posters, showing Obama wearing a feather headdress and a bone through his nose, have been popping up in e-mails, on Web sites and at Tea Party protests for weeks. The image has stoked debate and cast attention on the rallies, which have drawn people Tea Party organizers describe as on the fringe and not representative of the overall movement. Their general viewpoint, leaders say, is that there's been too much federal government intervention, particularly concerning health care and taxes. The witch doctor imagery is blatantly racist, critics contend. Others remind that presidents get made fun off all the time, and the election of a black president has only made racially charged political satire more sensitive. While not denying the crudeness of the image, Tea Party organizers stressed that those who carry the signs are a few ""bad apples.""  Watch how poster put spotlight on racism » . ""That [witch doctor] image is not representative at all of what this movement is about,"" said Joe Wierzbicki, a coordinator of the Tea Party Express, a three-week series of protests across the country. The anger the image portrays, however, ""says to me that a lot of people in this country are angry about the direction that the administration and Congress are taking us,"" he said. ""And you're going to see a wide expanse of those people,"" he continued. ""Some are going to be more extreme. Most of them are going to be in the mainstream of American politics, as evidenced by Obama's falling poll numbers."" An incendiary image such as witch doctor detracts from any hope for a cohesive message at the rallies, where many appear not to be associated directly with either the Republican or Democratic parties, said W. Joseph Campbell, a media professor at American University. And previous infringements of good taste don't make it acceptable to Photoshop the president into a witch doctor. ""It's true that presidents before have had to endure some rough stuff, and there's nothing wrong with satire,"" Campbell said. ""President Bush was morphed into Hitler. That was not excusable either. Just because it's happened in the past doesn't mean there isn't a line and it can't be crossed."" As a politics and African-American studies professor at Princeton University, Melissa Harris-Lacewell typically advocates discussion about the racist overtones in images or language bandied in public discourse. ""But I'm concerned in the age of Obama, too many of our public conversations about policy have been limited to a kind of investigative effort to determine whether opposition to him is based on race or substantive disagreement,"" she told CNN. ""The problem is, it can be both."" Harris-Lacewell points out that Obama made his African father a part of his campaign narrative. Now his critics are trying to mock that heritage. ""This witch doctor image is racist in a very specific way because of his proximity to Africa,"" she said. ""You can imagine there would have easily been a time when [Jewish New York Mayor Michael] Bloomberg would have been portrayed in anti-Semitic ways. You can go back to political cartoons when Irish Democrats were mocked, Italians were lampooned."" Spelman College history professor William Jelani Cobb, who has written extensively about race and politics, points out the original Boston Tea Party was driven by colonists who frequently declared that they had been ""enslaved"" by the king of England. The men who led that revolt dressed up as Native Americans when they dumped the tea into Boston Harbor in 1773. Hard to pin down and a seeming catch-all for general anger at the government, the modern Tea Party movement is grounded the belief that the federal government should stay out of state business. But ""states' rights is also an argument with a history tied to racial segregation during the civil rights' era,"" Harris-Lacewell said. And so it comes full circle. Cobb said Obama's election has also rekindled the historic rancor some whites feel against successful blacks. ""There is lots of connective tissue here,"" said Cobb. ""The Atlanta race riot of 1906 was partly about this. The upsurge of riots at the beginning of the 20th century was driven in part by the fact that blacks were perceived to be moving up in society -- at the expense of whites. The Atlanta race riot, which left 25 black people and two white people dead, was sparked by a series of false news reports about black people committing crimes, inciteful rhetoric from white politicians and an overall fear by whites that blacks were starting to make progress socially and politically in the south. ""Now we have a black president, which means, on its most basic level, that a black man has more power than any single white citizen in this country,"" Cobb said. ""Whether people want to admit it or not, I suspect the Tea Party crowd believes that the currency of whiteness has been devalued."" iReport.com: Share your thoughts on race and politics . There's another wrinkle to the witch doctor controversy. Obama was mocked by some critics as the ""magical negro"" during the campaign because he was perceived to be a solve-all to nation's problems. ""This is an echo of the theme during the campaign when his opponents would ask 'Who is Barack Obama?"" Cobb said. ""At that point, it was part of a somewhat cynical attempt to depict him as vaguely foreign and unknown,"" Cobb said. ""But now that he has control over actual policies, those views appear to have hardened, metastasized into something more vitriolic. ""Caricature is part of politics, but racist stereotyping isn't.""","Posters show President Obama with headdress, bone in his nose .

"(CNN) -- Of all the parts that make up my somewhat quirky life, there are few things that raise a stranger's eyebrows faster than discovering I love country music. Not a ""I like that one song by Lady Antebellum"" kind of love for country music either. Mine is a ""Barack I would love to join you and Michelle for dinner next Saturday, but you see I have tickets to see Eric Church so ..."" kind of love. When did this love affair begin? January 24, 1988. The night I met Randy Travis. Back then, it wasn't uncommon for families to gather around the television, and mine had done so that night to watch the American Music Awards. Michael Jackson was receiving a special honor, and Whitney Houston was scheduled to perform. At the time, those two were the most popular singers on the planet but for me, the night belonged to Travis. I had never heard of him or his mid-tempo ballad ""Forever and Ever, Amen"" before the show. Everyone knew who Kenny Rogers was, but usually the only country music you heard in my house was the theme song to the ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" But something about the purity of Travis' voice captured me. And even at the relatively immature age of 16, I found his portrayal of never-ending love so beautifully constructed by the lyrics of ""Forever"" that to this day, it eclipses almost every other love song I have heard. In fact, when I put together a brief video asking my better half to marry me, ""Forever"" was the only song I put on the soundtrack. That's why I was so sad to hear Travis was in critical condition in a Texas hospital. He was an unlikely voice of my youth. About as unlikely as you could be. Instead of listening to the latest from L.L. Cool J or Public Enemy, I would go to the record store and play his song ""Diggin' Up Bones"" over and over again. My friends would snicker and mock the twang in his voice. What they couldn't understand was that the various inflections in Travis' voice were the commas in the stories that he spun. Stories so universal that a white adult man from a small town in North Carolina could touch a skinny black kid in Detroit without ever meeting. When I'm in the car singing ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" I imagine someone 1,000 miles away is cranking that song up in the car and for three minutes and 31 seconds, we're connected. ""They say that time can play tricks on a memory, . make people forget things they once knew. Well, it's easy to see . It's happening to me . I've already forgotten every woman but you..."" Complete strangers can stand silent next to each other in an elevator and not even look each other in the eye. But at a concert, those same strangers could find themselves dancing and singing together like best friends. That's the power of music. And when you've experienced this magical bond with strangers, there is even a greater connection to the artists that provided the vehicle for that bond. That's why it's hard for to see Travis this way. We've all watched once-beloved music icons such as Jackson and Houston fall from grace in similar fashion -- ensnared by drug abuse, publicly humiliated, fighting for and sometimes losing their lives. As Travis lies critically ill in a hospital bed, those of us who count ourselves his fans, pray his story doesn't end in the same way. But we've watched the declining grip he's had on his life for a handful of years now. The bitter divorce. The uncontrollable drinking, the arrests. And now this. It's just sad. Because of Travis, I learned Waylon Jennings was the man who sang ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" theme song. Because of Travis, I have developed lifelong friendships with some amazing people who work in and perform country music. Before Travis, I used to think ""soul music"" had one certain sound. Because of Travis, I learned that wasn't true. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","Strangers are baffled when they learn LZ Granderson loves country music .

"Editor's note: Jane Velez-Mitchell is host of the HLN show, ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,"" a topical event-driven show with a wide range of viewpoints. Velez-Mitchell is the author of ""Secrets Can Be Murder: What America's Most Sensational Crimes Tell Us About Ourselves."" Jane Velez-Mitchell says the targets of stalkers aren't just celebrities and that millions are victims. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Hollywood starlet Jennifer Love Hewitt recently obtained a restraining order against a man who she claims had been stalking her since 2007. The man sent hundreds of threatening letters, as well as plane tickets to Australia, and he left flowers at the home of Hewitt's mother. Uma Thurman had even more frightening brushes with her stalker before he was convicted. Jack Jordan visited her house and also tried to get into her on-set trailer. Thurman eventually faced Jordan in court, where he was convicted of stalking and aggravated harassment and sentenced to three years probation and psychiatric counseling. This, to me, sounds like a victory for Jordan, since he was placed in the same courtroom as his victim and could eventually go right back to stalking. Many assume this type of thing is relegated only to those who grace the covers of gossip magazines and movie posters. Sheila Ann Grayson wasn't famous, but that didn't save her. Police in South Carolina say Grayson was killed by her stalker last May, two weeks after taking out a restraining order against him. A new study published this month by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated based on a survey that 3.4 million Americans per year are victims of stalking. For some perspective, that's more than the entire population of Chicago, Illinois. The comprehensive study found that divorced or separated individuals are at the highest risk of being stalked. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be stalked, and two thirds of female victims are stalked by males. It is becoming an epidemic -- 1.4 million Americans were stalked a decade ago, according to a similar Justice Department study, and new technology is partly responsible for the increase. Texting, e-mailing and social networking sites make it easier to connect with friends. But they also make it easier for stalkers to connect with -- and track -- their targets. I recently saw a cellphone advertisement promoting an application that allows the user to track friends on a map and see what they're doing. The ad sent chills up my spine. What a tool that would be for someone's obsessed ex-lover. America's law enforcement system doesn't play a dominant role in deterring stalking. Most incidents aren't reported by the victims. And according to the study, of the victims surveyed, 15 percent credited law enforcement warnings for keeping their stalker in line while only 10 percent said a restraining order did the trick. Even locking stalkers up only works until they're free. Only 6 percent of victims said the stalking stopped after the offender was arrested or incarcerated. Stalkers often have underlying psychological problems or are socially incompetent, and about 30 percent have delusional disorders, according to a study in the American Journal of Psychiatry. So trying to solve stalking cases through legal means is like trying to clear a roach problem without getting rid of the food lying around. The American Journal of Psychiatry study recommends a mixture of legal action and therapeutic intervention. But intervention must happen early. Troubled children who get no counseling could grow up and develop the dysfunctional traits identified in the American Journal of Psychiatry study. In elementary school we should teach nonviolent conflict resolution and healthy communication skills, which will help children cope with issues like rejection and sexuality later in life. I've been stalked and it was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. I can say firsthand that it becomes a hunter-prey relationship. So we must try psychological approaches that emphasize healthy interaction between consenting persons. Therapy could help early offenders see their victims as humans again, instead of objects. Some stalkers show addictive behavior, and their victim is the drug. Just as marijuana is seen as a gateway drug, I believe stalking is a gateway crime that leads to violence and even murder. This approach provides another angle from which to attack the problem. Unlike other crimes, stalking crosses all classes, races, and age groups. This makes it difficult to pin down causes, but provides opportunities to try out these creative and inexpensive prevention techniques. But we can only change our approach to this problem if victims speak up. Approximately 60 percent of stalking victims don't report to the police, according to the Justice Department study. Though law enforcement alone isn't the answer, imagine if all 3.4 million victims had reported. It would provide authorities with a much larger pool of information. And with such a large number of people affected, it becomes a problem politicians can't ignore. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Jane Velez-Mitchell.","Jane Velez-Mitchell: New study says 3 million-plus  Americans are stalked .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Mika knows how to dress for the occasion. Mika's new album, ""The Boy Who Knew Too Much,"" acknowledges some of his teen issues. The singer showed up to CNN.com's interview in bright blue felt suspenders, or ""braces"" as they're called in his UK homeland; ""suspenders"" are the naughty things ladies wear to keep their stockings up. ""On CNN you've got a thing about suspenders, don't you?"" he says, referring to Larry King's penchant for wearing them. (CNN International anchor Richard Quest is fond of suspenders as well.) ""So I thought, why not join the ranks?"" Not that Mika, born Michael Holbrook Penniman, likes to do what everyone else is doing. His 2007 breakout album, ""Life in Cartoon Motion,"" introduced him as an eccentric, wild-haired singer with a falsetto voice that might've seemed out of place on the modern pop scene. But he certainly commanded attention.  Watch Mika hold the scene » . Fueled by peppy hits such as ""Love Today"" and ""Grace Kelly,"" Mika's bejeweled star shot high, with more than 6 million albums sold worldwide and top fashion designers wanting to dress him (Christian Louboutin designs shoes for the 6-foot-4 singer). Mika, 26, now has a follow-up album, ""The Boy Who Knew Too Much,"" which addresses some of the awkwardness he experienced as a teen. ""I was terrified of talking to people,"" he says. ""I was a bit of a loner. I'm angry with myself about that. I wish I had more guts when I was younger because then I would've said things to people's faces instead of just running away all the time."" No matter. Now he just turns his gripes into songs. ""If you put a message and a catchy melody together, suddenly they want to listen to what you're saying. That's the thing about pop music: it hoodwinks you into listening to it before you even know what it's talking about. I guess that's why I fell in love with it. It's funny because I think when you look at most of the people in the world who write pop music, they were never popular when they were younger."" Tracking Mika . Mika kicks off a 10-city North American tour in Toronto, Canada, on October 12. Check his Web site for dates, or just listen out for the ""doom da da di da di doom da da di da di.""

In my eyes, comic books and illustration are the same kind of art forms. They're immediate. It has to hit you really fast. Pop music works from the same principles. In comic books, you always have black outlines. It's almost like the melody of a pop song is the black outlines you find in a comic book."" Mum kills the fun . Mika had booked a luxury home in Beverly Hills, California, as a base to record his new album. But two days before he was to move in, his mother put the kibosh on the plans and insisted her son work from the same dingy apartment he recorded his debut. ""Mum said the more money you spend on your comfort, the worse your album will be. You make the choice."" He relented. Was it worth it? ""No! I still wish I stayed in the big fancy house. It would've been a lot more fun!"" How high can he go? Mika: ""Some people say I've got a five-octave range, which is ridiculous. That would mean I'd sing like Mariah Carey or that alien in 'The Fifth Element.' And I'm nothing like that blue alien. I've got a range of about 3 1/2 octaves.""","Mika's new album is ""The Boy Who Knew Too Much""

"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao will take a slight weight advantage into his fourth fight with Mexico's Juan Manuel Marquez in Las Vegas Saturday. The Filipino tipped the scales right on the 147lb welterweight limit in the weigh-in at the MGM Grand Hotel Friday with Mexico's Marquez coming in at 143lb. In front of a vociferous crowd, the pair did not exchange words as they completed the formalities, posing for pictures before the ritual eyeball to eyeball confrontation. Marquez, 39, is seeking his first win in a classic series of bouts stretching over eight years. The first was a draw, with Pacquiao claiming narrow victories on points in the other two, including a controversial decision 13 months ago. ""We know each other really well and it's going to be a war,"" predicted Marquez after the weigh-in. ""It is most important to show people who the best man is,"" Marquez added. The 33-year-old Pacquiao, 54-4-2 with 38 knockouts, lost his last fight to Timothy Bradley back in June, himself falling victim to a disputed decision over 12 rounds. He is anxious to get his career back on track, with the prospect of a showdown with American superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. still eagerly awaited by boxing fans. Pacquiao, who is an elected congressman in his native Philippines, voiced his concerns about the effects of Typhoon Bopha which has swept through his country with a reported death toll exceeding 500 people. ""This fight is dedicated to them,"" he said. But his words were drowned out by the Mexican supporters for Marquez, who is 54-6-1 with 39 KOs in his lengthy career.

"JACKSON, Georgia (CNN) -- ""I gave up smoking, women and drinkin' last night,"" the singer shouts, ""and it was the worst 15 minutes of mah life!"" The Rev. Joe Hunter hears all types of stories from drivers at his truck stop chapel. The music blaring from the radio tonight is country. The dessert special is peach cobbler. And the customers are wide-bodied truck drivers, lumbering into a Georgia truck stop at suppertime. But another group of truckers nearby is singing a new song. They amble into a truck stop trailer adorned with pictures of Jesus and sing the hymn ""O Happy Day"" in wobbly bass voices. ""I've been back and forth between God and Satan over the years,"" trucker Harold ""Jumper"" McBride says as he stands to share his story. ""It was a rough life, but I finally found that saving grace to make life a whole lot better."" It's the Wednesday night service at ""Chaplain Joe's"" truck stop chapel service. The chaplain himself, a lanky, bearded man with tan cowboy boots, sits in the back of his narrow chapel, saying the loudest amens. For 28 years, the Rev. Joe Hunter has been a chaplain to the truckers. Though most ministers preach to people in the pews, he takes God to people on the go. He reaches out to truckers at fuel stops, in parking lots, on the CB and through a radio show called ""Heaven's Road."" He hears all sorts of stories: tales of loneliness, thoughts of suicide, struggles with guilt. A Vietnam veteran, he's even lived a little of what he's heard. Yet Hunter says most truckers reaffirm his faith in human nature. ""Every snowflake is different, and God created us that way to be unique,"" he says. ""I've learned to appreciate the goodness of people. I believe there's some good in everybody, and I love to try to find it.""  Watch as Hunter explains truckers' need for a place of worship » . 'Last American cowboys' Trucking isn't simply Hunter's ministry. It was his first love. He started working at a truck stop at 16 years old and drove a truck for 20 years. ""America moves by trucks,"" he says. ""Without trucks, America stops."" Hunter's Truckstop Ministries Inc. works like a spiritual gas station. He prays with truckers, coaxes them to make tough decisions and hands out taped sermons that fortify them on lengthy business trips. ""The greatest thing about being a truck driver is that you have a lot of time to think,"" Hunter says. ""The horrible thing about being a truck driver is that you have a lot of time to think."" There's plenty of time to do ill as well. Drug dealers, prostitutes, runaways -- they all hover around some truck stops, Hunter and drivers say. ""People being away from home -- a lot of people think they're just free to do whatever they want,"" McBride says. McBride can spend up to four weeks away from the Florida home he shares his wife, Kathy. ""Lonesome. I miss home a lot,"" he says when asked to describe life on the road. Despite the trucker's grind, those at Hunter's chapel talk about their profession with pride. ""I call truckers the last American cowboys,"" says Robert Ryan, president of the Atlanta Travel Center truck stop in Jackson, Georgia, home of Hunter's main chapel. ""They're pretty much out there on their own,"" Ryan says. ""They're doing their own thing. They're good people."" And, like cowboys, Hunter says, truckers have a ""yearning to wander."" ""You leave Florida in the winter, headed for Detroit,"" Hunter says. ""When you leave, you're in short sleeves. When you get in Detroit, you're surrounded by ice. It's like life is on fast-forward."" Service inside the truckers' chapel . Truckers looking for relief from their wanderlust can spot Hunter's chapel from the highway at night. A neon red cross is perched above the chapel like a beacon.  See photos of the truckers' chapel » . The tiny chapel's walls are plastered with scenes of Jesus' crucifixion. Paperback Bibles and pamphlets urging conversion are scattered about the seats. The service begins with prayer, then hymns and a short sermon. No collection plate is passed. The truckers linger afterward and talk about a painting hanging on the chapel's back wall. The painting, entitled ""In His Hands,"" depicts a truck about to slide off an icy ledge. The truck is yanked back to safety by God's hands. McBride, the Florida trucker, glances at it and smiles. He says he was once hauling a load of 55-gallon drums of orange concentrate down an unfamiliar mountain road when he hit an s-shaped curve and lost control. Yet somehow, he didn't crash. ""Somebody told me I was on nine tires,"" McBride says. He motions to the painting. ""That hand is probably the only thing that kept me on the road,"" he says. The conversation turns to preaching. Gene Smith, another trucker, talks about filling up on taped sermons while driving. ""As long as you tune in to God, you're a lot happier,"" Smith says. ""I'm living heaven on Earth. Everything is going perfect. I've been connected to God since I was 5 years old."" Hunter's journey: from Vietnam to the road . Hunter's connection to God didn't come as easy, he says. He was born in rural Georgia, and his father died when he was 3 years old. He dropped out of school at 14 and was drafted five years later to go to Vietnam. Hunter became a trucker four days after returning from Vietnam. He slipped into drinking and drugs, and ""Satan blessed me for a while."" Then, one Sunday night, he stumbled into a tiny Baptist church service in rural Georgia. The preacher seemed to know all of his secret sins, Hunter says. ""I thought somebody told him that I was coming,"" Hunter says. ""He read my mail, boy."" Hunter became a Christian that night. He returned home and told his wife, Jan, that she was going to be saved. They've been married now for 42 years and have two children and 10 grandchildren. Hunter calls Jan his partner in ministry. God had more plans for him, though, Hunter says. While trucking, he grew frustrated because he could rarely find a church to attend when he was on the road. ""Most churches can't park 18-wheelers,"" he says. Hunter decided to take church to the truckers. He established his first Bible study in 1981 at an Atlanta truck stop.

""I'm in awe every day of what he's allowed me to do."" Hunter now has a national reputation. Scott Weidner, president of Transport for Christ, a 58-year-old company that provides mobile chapels to truck stops in North America, knows Hunter. He and Hunter oversee arguably the two largest groups for trucker chaplains in the nation. ""He's a former trucker, so he relates very well to truckers, "" Weidner says. ""He's got a heart for the Lord, for the lost and for truckers."" Churches heard of Hunter's talents as well. Once, leaders from one church asked him to be their pastor. Hunter refused. He says he's no longer driven by that ""yearning to wander."" He's found his home. ""I wouldn't trade places with anybody,"" he says outside his chapel. ""I love what I'm doing.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Harry Connick Jr. doesn't look like someone who's released 24 albums: no gray hairs, no stooped posture. Harry Connick Jr.'s new album, ""Your Songs,"" contains standards old and new. At 42 (his birthday was September 11) the singer/pianist was boyish and enthusiastic when we caught up with him at an event at New York's Hiro Ballroom last week to celebrate his latest release. Called ""Your Songs,"" the new album features standards such as ""All the Way"" and ""Some Enchanted Evening"" and rock-era pop tunes including ""Close to You"" and ""Can't Help Falling in Love."" The idea was to sing songs that people know and love, Connick says. Not that it was his idea necessarily. The concept was mostly dreamed up by impresario and Sony Music executive Clive Davis, who had indicated he'd really like to work with Connick. Connick, an accomplished composer unaccustomed to working with studio bigwigs, admits he was at first scratching his head over the idea of collaborating with Davis: ""I didn't even know what that means."" Getting on the same page in the beginning wasn't easy. ""I'm not gonna lie, a couple of those meetings were rough,"" Connick told the audience at Hiro, which included 77-year-old Davis. Connick also made fun of Davis' use of music terminology like ""picayune"" and ""strident"" and his reference to songs as ""copyrights.""  Watch Connick talk about the ""intense experience"" » . But there was flattery, too, when Connick addressed Davis directly from the stage between songs. ""Clive, I have to say, it was a great learning experience to watch how your brain works,"" he said. A few tidbits that emerged after picking Connick's brain: . Hands on, hands off . While Davis, known for building careers for the likes of Whitney Houston and Alicia Keys, was eager to be involved with Connick's latest project, he suggested Connick arrange all the pieces on the album himself. And when it came to recording (which took about two weeks), Connick says Davis respectfully stepped out of the way. Wynton learns Elvis . Connick invited jazz trumpeter and lifelong friend Wynton Marsalis to do a solo on his version of Elvis Presley's ""Can't Help Falling in Love."" Says Connick: ""He says, 'I don't know that. I don't listen to Elvis Presley. I don't know the song.' So I played it for him and he said 'OK' and he played it once and went home. And it was a brilliant solo."" Paging Dr. Connick . After portraying a doctor who develops a breast cancer drug in the 2008 Lifetime movie ""Living Proof,"" Connick says he gets approached by strangers who often confuse him for the real deal: ""People have come up to me and said, 'I'm taking the drug Herceptin. Are there any drug interactions or precautions I need to take?' And I say, 'I'm a piano player, man. I don't know what you should be taking.' It's a strange deal."" Oh my, NOLA . Connick is upbeat about his hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana, four years after Hurricane Katrina: ""Man, New Orleans is really coming along. And as tragic as that storm was, it really shed a lot of light on some topics and issues that needed to be discussed and remedied and I'm so thankful that a lot of progress has been made. It still has a long way to go ... but it really looks like it's moving right along.""","Harry Connick Jr.'s new album, ""Your Songs,"" is collection of old and new standards .

"(CNN) -- The new era of openness in Burma has spread hope and anxiety among the country's journalists at home and abroad. This year, many exiled journalists have visited Burma -- which became known as Myanmar under the previous military junta -- while some publications and news organizations, previously based outside the once-reclusive state, have decided to open offices inside the country. This week, our publication The Irrawaddy magazine will hit newsstands in the capital, Yangon, for the first time since it was founded by Burmese exiles two decades ago to provide an independent view of the situation in Burma under the authoritarian regime. Our staff, who secretly worked with us for many years inside the country at considerable risk to themselves, now report from our new offices there. Does this mean the changes here are concrete and promising? I am cautiously optimistic. Therefore, our strategy now is to keep one foot in and one foot out -- we will maintain our headquarters in Thailand. This is the first time we have received permission to print and distribute the magazine inside the country. It wasn't too long ago that it was unthinkable to carry and read such a publication freely in public, let alone distribute it. In the past, we have sent our magazines to Burma using clandestine channels, while our website was blocked inside the country until recently. Since I returned to Burma early this year for the first time in 24 years, I have met many opposition leaders and activists who spent several years in prisons or under house arrest, and they told me they somehow managed to get hold of copies of The Irrawaddy. Win Tin, a leading member of opposition party the National League for Democracy (NLD), spent 19 years in prison. He told me in February that he sometimes received the magazine while he was under detention in the infamous Insein Prison in the capital -- a facility known for its inhumane conditions and torture of inmates. Tin Oo, co-founder of the NLD and former commander in chief of the armed forces during the 1970s, spoke highly of The Irrawaddy. When I asked him how he knew of it, he replied: ""When I was under house arrest, I received it through a diplomatic channel. I read it again and again, and when military intelligence service came to see me at my house I had to hide it. ""They could double the prison sentence if they saw the magazine,"" he added with a chuckle. Burmese officials and several senior leaders whom I met and interviewed in Burma know the magazine -- I sensed mixed feelings as they have a deep-rooted fear as well as respect for the magazine and our website. I remembered General Khin Nyunt, a feared spy chief who ran a torture chamber and kept politicians and activists under lock and key, once publicly told a visiting delegation that they should not read The Irrawaddy. Today, I see the media landscape is changing as reporters enjoy more freedom to cover and report stories that would have been subjected to censorship in the past. I hope these changes are real and irreversible. Since coming to power, President Thein Sein has taken major steps to open up the country. In his early speeches he mentioned the importance of the fourth pillar in society and revealed that both he and his office follow media reports from both inside and outside the country. In August, the Ministry of Information told editors of weekly journals that their outlets ""no longer need to pass the censorship board."" Tint Swe, the head of the country's Press Scrutiny and Registration Division (PSRD), added that the easing of restrictions was the result of a change of policy. Journalists who faced pressure and imprisonment in Burma have cautiously welcomed the announcement that they will no longer be required to submit articles to the country's draconian censorship board. But they are very aware that ""Big Brother"" is still there to monitor and watch. The move is not enough to restore media freedom. However, it is safe to say that the government has made a concession after previously shutting down local journals and facing pressure and street protests from journalists. The government still continues to monitor news and bulletins, and the censorship board is still active and has not been abolished. Burma's 1962 Printers and Publishers Registration Act is still there -- the act was imposed shortly after former dictator General Ne Win seized power. In fact, ever more weekly journals have been facing defamation lawsuits from government officials and businessmen. It is still sensitive to write about corruption cases involving current and former officials, especially when looking at Burma's relations with North Korea and China. The Ministry of Information still controls publishing licenses and any publication that harms the reputation of a government department can still be reprimanded under the Printers and Publishers Registration Act. Publishers can also face heavy sentences under Burma's Penal Code if they are found guilty of inciting the public to participate in unlawful activity. Meanwhile, state-owned newspapers still distribute the same propaganda, while a number of former generals in the previous regime own several leading weekly dailies. Their mission appears not about promoting independent journalism and rational debate in this fragile transition period but about making money. Meanwhile, all publications are required to follow guidelines designed to protect the three national causes: non-disintegration of the country, non-disintegration of national solidarity and the perpetuation of sovereignty. Journalists say that the notorious 2004 Electronics Act also remains in place, with many activists, journalists, bloggers and social media commentators behind bars for sending prohibited information, messages or photos through the Internet. Many face between seven and 15 years in jail and may also be liable for a fine. In Burma, most journalists exercise heavy self-censorship, and this will continue. During the wave of sectarian violence in Rahkine state recently, local media appeared wary about reporting on the ongoing violence against Muslim Rohingya populations. Sadly they take a racist and populist editorial stance against this oppressed population. In fact, the media seemed reluctant to criticize the government when police applied excessive force to crack down on peaceful demonstrators and monks during a recent protest at copper mine -- despite widespread condemnation from elsewhere, including Democracy activist and lawmaker Aung San Suu Kyi. There is still a long way to go until Burmese reporters are able to freely write and publish sensitive stories, engage in proper investigative reporting and provide quality journalism in Burma. We've been waiting for this opportunity to enter Burma, but we know that there are limits. We're still testing the water. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aung Zaw.","Previously outlawed magazines, newspapers now operating inside Myanmar .

"(CNN) -- October 16 marked Flea's 50th birthday, and the iconic bass player of the Red Hot Chili Peppers held an event celebrating both his life and his life's focus on giving back. An army of caterers scurried around his Los Angeles backyard Tuesday, preparing for a party that was a birthday bash as well as a fundraiser for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, the nonprofit school Flea co-founded 11 years ago. Flea's days of rock star excess are clearly over -- unless you count the silent auction, where a Banksy drawing of a rat fetched $100,000 and a spirited bidding war erupted between actor Owen Wilson, musician Ben Harper and producer Rick Rubin over a crayon-colored cashmere blanket that ultimately sold for $2,250. Shortly before his guests arrived, Flea reflected on the first half-century of his life -- which has been just as colorful as the cashmere blanket that caused such a ruckus during the silent auction. With the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he's won seven Grammys, pioneered a bold style of rock infused with funk and rap, overcome drug dependency and earned induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On his own, Flea's found purpose and personal satisfaction in giving back. CNN: Happy Birthday, Flea! 50. How does it feel? Flea: Outstanding! I woke up this morning and I just felt so grateful for everything. Grateful to be alive, grateful to be exactly where I am. I give and receive love every day, (and) I feel creatively vibrant. I have some great friends; I feel like I'm capable of giving a lot to the world. And ultimately, that's what I really care about, is just giving. CNN: Tonight you're also holding a benefit for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, which you co-founded 11 years ago. Flea: The Silverlake Conservatory is a nonprofit music school in Los Angeles where we teach music, mostly to kids, but to people of all ages -- people who are old, people with beards, all kinds of people. But we teach all the orchestral instruments, all the band instruments, group lessons, private lessons, orchestra, adult choir, children's choir, all kinds of music groups. And we're not about fame or celebrity or anything like that. We're academic, teaching theory and fundamentals of music and technique on a particular instrument. Unfortunately, the public school system has cut the funding to music programs, and there's a big void, so we're doing our best to fill it in our community. CNN: What made you decide to bring the annual fundraiser to your own home this year? Flea: Well, I've done it before, but this is a special night tonight. We've had incredible fine artists donate to our auction tonight -- Damien Hirst, Takashi Murakami, Banksy, Matt Monahan, Laura Schnitger, Barry McGee, Ed Ruscha. Some of the great people in the contemporary art world have come out to support our music education. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing tonight, Rancid is playing tonight, and it's all happening in my backyard, and it's my birthday. You know, 11 years ago we had the opening night for the school party and it was on my birthday. So it's always an incredible birthday to have. In a minute, I'm going to go shower, put on my suit, and it's on. CNN: When you woke up this morning, did you reflect back? Flea: Yeah, turning 50 is a little bit of a taking stock moment. I feel probably a little dumber. I don't think I'm as sharp as I was when I was younger, but I'm definitely wiser, and less likely to make gigantic blunders of an intellectual, spiritual, emotional or physical type. Less likely to do something dumb, but I'm not as quick. I feel a little bit wiser, but more than anything the passion for the things that I really care about like playing music, and being kind, and children, and the things I love -- sports, books, art -- my passion for all these things has deepened. It just feels like there's an infinite well of greatness to get into. I just feel like I go deeper and deeper into it. I feel like I have a profound spiritual life, as well. CNN: When you were young, did you ever think you would achieve the level of musical success that you've had? Flea: No. I've always kind of been an in-the-moment kind of person. I don't think that far in advance or have any idea what's around the next corner. And I never have. I just kind of try to make the best decisions as they come up. And as life has gone on, I really have faith in that philosophy a lot. I really have faith that each thing that comes up is a gift, and I'm grateful for the opportunity, whether it be a difficult thing or a fun thing. CNN: You've been in the Chili Peppers for more than half your life. Do you see yourself continuing with them for eternity? Flea: I love the Chili Peppers, and I would love to. If there's anything I know, it's every time you start making plans, you don't know what's going to come up next. Anything can happen. So I love being in the Chili Peppers and it's my home, and I've been doing it for more than half my life. Of course, during the course of doing it, there's been all kinds of ups and downs, and moments of extreme (positivity), floating on clouds of greatness, and times of just groveling, and misery, and uncertainty, and anger, and love and all those things. Like being in a family. I really can't predict. But I love being in it for now, and right now, about as far as I'm thinking is getting through this tour that we're doing, performing at the highest level possible, then hunkering down and writing another record. CNN: You also keep busy with side projects. You performed with Patti Smith a couple of days ago, then you have the Atoms for Peace project. Where is that going? Flea: Wherever it goes, it goes. I've been very fortunate to play with some great artists in my life, and Patti is one of them. I love her to death. I'd do anything for her. And if she says, ""Flea, come play,"" I come. She's just the greatest. And my thing with Thom (Yorke from Radiohead), Atoms for Peace -- Thom, and Nigel (Godrich), and Mauro (Refosco) and Joey (Waronker) -- is just fun, and I'm grateful for that, as well. I love those guys. CNN: Looking back on your 50 years, is there anything you'd do differently? Flea: Nothing! CNN: It must be nice to wake up in the morning and think that. Flea: Yeah. Of course. I've made a billion mistakes, but I wouldn't have learned without making them. I needed to make errors, and misbehave, and be an insensitive, thoughtless person to work my hardest on becoming a kind, caring one. CNN: So when you blow out the candles on your birthday cake, what are you going to be wishing for? Flea: A Lakers world championship.","Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea turned 50 on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- A Florida court technician has the job of blurring Justin Bieber's private parts on jail video before you can see it. The video will then be handed over to news organizations this week under Florida's open records law, a Miami judge ordered Tuesday. It's part of several hours of video captured by surveillance cameras inside the Miami Beach Police Department's jail, where Bieber was held after his arrest on DUI charges on January 23. Miami-Dade County Judge William Altfield rejected arguments from Bieber's lawyer that the video should be kept private. ""The court finds that images of the defendant while in custody at the Miami Beach Police Department are relevant to the public's right to know,"" Altfield ruled Tuesday. The segments to be released include a sequence in which Bieber ""appears to be urinating"" in a cell, ""revealing an image of the defendant's genitalia,"" the judge wrote. The order, however, instructs the court's video technician to blur ""the image wherein genitalia is observed."" ""While the defendant may not enjoy all of the expectations of privacy that he enjoys outside of a jail setting, he still retains his expectation of dignity,"" the judge said. Several photographs taken by police of Bieber showing his tattoos were given to the media Tuesday. Video showing Bieber doing push-ups in a jail cell and attempting a sobriety test in a hallway were released last month. Florida's open records law gives the news media full access to documents, photographs and video collected by police unless there is a compelling reason to keep them private. A status hearing is set for March 11 in Bieber's DUI case, which also includes a charge of resisting arrest without violence and driving with an expired license. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","Images of Bieber urinating ""are relevant to the public's right to know,"" judge rules .

"(CNN) -- A pioneer in sales of digital music, Apple on Monday became a late entrant in the booming music-streaming wars. When its iTunes Radio feature launches this fall along with a new version of Apple's mobile operating system, it will go head-to-head with established competitors such as Pandora and Rdio, as well as other tech heavyweights in Facebook-affiliated Spotify, Twitter Music and Google Play All Access. All of which raises the question: In a crowded field, what's going to persuade people already using (and, in some cases, paying for) those other services to switch to Apple's? Apple appears to be banking on the extensive music library it's piled up on iTunes and the customer base that's already used to shopping there. The iTunes store boasts a catalog of 26 million songs (Spotify, by way of comparison, claims more than 20 million) and more than 50 billion files have been downloaded from iTunes since it launched in 2001. ""As a large company, Apple has a few major advantages,"" said Karl Volkman, chief technical officer at Chicago's SRV Network. ""They have a large and loyal customer base established and the capability to be competitive with advertising revenue rates, both providing great incentive for music publishers."" But after Monday's announcement, many folks in tech circles seemed less bullish on the idea. For a company that built its empire on bold leaps into the unknown -- few had heard of smartphones before the iPhone or tablets before the iPad -- Web radio feels like a copycat maneuver, they said. It remains to be seen whether Apple will go all-in with the product, seeing it as the logical extension of its iTunes brand, or float it as an afterthought, like its short-lived and seldom-used Ping social site. ""Apple's entry is a discovery tool that seems to exist just to help sell you tracks from the iTunes music store,"" wrote Roberto Baldwin at Wired. ""But hey, at least it has streaming Led Zeppelin."" Apple Vice President Eddy Cue doesn't exactly stifle that line of thought. ""iTunes Radio is an incredible way to listen to personalized radio stations which have been created just for you,"" Cue said in the statement. ""It's the music you love most and the music you're going to love, and you can easily buy it from the iTunes Store with just one click."" It's no mystery why Apple, like Facebook, Google and Twitter before them, wants in on music streaming. Streaming, by which users listen to ad-supported music for free or pay a monthly fee, is the fastest growing form of music listening, according to industry reports. The Recording Industry Association of America, in its annual report, said that while overall music sales were down in 2012, digital-music sales were up 14%, topping $4 billion. ""Digital growth was driven by large increases in revenues through what can broadly be referred to as 'access models,' where users can choose to listen from large libraries of music rather than purchasing individual songs or albums,"" the report read. Apple's offering will be ad-supported, in addition to serving as another portal into the iTunes store. And unlike most of its competitors, which are available across platforms, it will only be accessible on Apple products. Like Pandora, users will be able to ""seed"" stations with particular artists and hear selections from similar ones. Apple will track a user's selections, as well as their iTunes purchase history, to continually fine-tune their stations to their tastes. On mobile devices, users will be able to ask voice-activated ""assistant"" Siri to play, skip or pause songs, or to search for groups, or styles of music to play. But in the wake of the announcement, most analysis focused on an apparent lack of innovation on Apple's part. If it ain't broke, the thought went, why does Apple want to fix it? ""iTunes Radio is a Pandora knockoff,"" Rocco Pendola of finance site The Street told CNN. ""It absolutely will not come close to Pandora in terms of functionality and user experience. It can't possibly do that. Pandora is a 13-year-old company ... . Apple is just doing what everyone else had done -- copying it.""","Apple's iTunes Radio joins crowded music-streaming field .

"(WIRED) -- If you work for IBM, you can bring your iPhone to work, but forget about using the phone's voice-activated digital assistant. Siri isn't welcome on Big Blue's networks. The reason? Siri ships everything you say to her to a big data center in Maiden, North Carolina. And the story of what really happens to all of your Siri-launched searches, e-mail messages and inappropriate jokes is a bit of a black box. IBM CIO Jeanette Horan told MIT's Technology Review this week that her company has banned Siri outright because, according to the magazine, ""The company worries that the spoken queries might be stored somewhere."" Apple's new 'spaceship' campus: What will the neighbors say? It turns out that Horan is right to worry. In fact, Apple's iPhone Software License Agreement spells this out: ""When you use Siri or Dictation, the things you say will be recorded and sent to Apple in order to convert what you say into text,"" Apple says. Siri collects a bunch of other information -- names of people from your address book and other unspecified user data, all to help Siri do a better job. How long does Apple store all of this stuff, and who gets a look at it? Well, the company doesn't actually say. Again, from the user agreement: ""By using Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple's and its subsidiaries' and agents' transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input and User Data, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation, and other Apple products and services."" Apple and Samsung begin settlement talks . Because some of the data that Siri collects can be very personal, the American Civil Liberties Union put out a warning about Siri just a couple of months ago. Privacy was always a big concern for Siri's developers, says Edward Wrenbeck, the lead developer of the original Siri iPhone app, which was eventually acquired by Apple. And for corporate users, there are even more potential pitfalls. ""Just having it known that you're at a certain customer's location might be in violation of a non-disclosure agreement,"" he says. Apple designer 'winces' over some past product choices . But he agrees that many of the issues raised by Apple's Siri data handling are similar to those that other internet companies face. ""I really don't think it's something to worry about,"" he says. ""People are already doing things on these mobile devices. Maybe Siri makes their life a little bit easier, but it's not exactly opening up a new avenue that wasn't there before."" But other companies have been pressured by privacy groups over the way they store customer data. Google, for example, has come under fire in the past for the way it handles a massive database of user search data. But IBM doesn't ban Google. Neither Apple nor IBM could be reached for comment Tuesday, but there are a couple of important differences between Siri and Google that may have IBM worried: For one, Siri can be used to write e-mails or text messages. So, in theory, Apple could be storing confidential IBM messages. Former Apple employee explains 'upside-down' logo . Another difference: After being dogged by privacy advocates, Google now anonymizes search results -- making them difficult, if not impossible, to trace back to an individual user -- after nine months. Maybe if Apple agreed to do something like that, Siri would be welcome over in Armonk, New York. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(Health.com) -- The line in the middle of Christine Honeycutt's forehead was barely noticeable at first. It was a faint gray smudge, just a half-inch long from top to bottom. ""It looked like she ran into a doorjamb, which kids do,"" says Christine's mother, Vicki. But the five-year-old swore she'd done no such thing. When she looked closer, Vicki also noticed what appeared to be a small bruise or birthmark on the left side of her daughter's neck. That, too, seemed like nothing, but when the marks didn't go away after a couple of weeks, Vicki took Christine to the doctor. ""It's just a discoloration,"" the pediatrician said, giving Vicki a cream. ""Keep her out of the sun and put this on it."" The cream didn't work. Five months later, the gray line was still there -- and it now extended halfway down Christine's forehead. Health.com: 20 medical mysteries and miracles . The Honeycutts consulted a second doctor -- this time in southern California, where the family had recently moved from Charlotte, North Carolina -- and received the same advice. Vicki wasn't reassured, but she wasn't unduly worried, either. Christine was otherwise healthy, and she seemed to be enjoying kindergarten at her new school. Then, in first grade, Christine started inexplicably gaining weight and suffered a violent seizure at home one evening, losing consciousness and convulsing. The ER doctors who treated her concluded that the seizure had been brought on by the 102-degree fever she'd been running, but Vicki suspected it wasn't that simple. Health.com: Doctors induce 5-month coma to save woman's life . A surprising diagnosis . \Within a few months of the seizure, the line on Christine's forehead stretched down to her eyebrow and looked more like an indentation than a shadow. People were noticing. One of Christine's teachers told her to wipe the ink off her forehead. ""I can't,"" she replied. ""It's always there."" There were other troubling signs: One side of Christine's forehead was normal, but the other was ""meaty,"" Vicki recalls. And her ears looked out of proportion to one another -- an asymmetry that seemed to extend over her entire face. ""One side of her face looked like a baby,"" Vicki says. ""It looked like one side of her face was growing and the other was not."" As it turns out, that's exactly what was happening. In 2008, two and a half years after the line first appeared on Christine's face, a geneticist who specializes in facial deformities finally diagnosed her with Parry-Romberg syndrome, an extremely rare autoimmune disorder that affects roughly one in a million people. Christine's own immune system had turned against her so that one side of her face was developing normally while the other side was slowly but surely deteriorating. Parry-Romberg syndrome, also known as progressive facial hemiatrophy, was first identified in the early 1800s. It usually starts in childhood and gets worse with time, and it seems to be more common in girls. (Although Christine was diagnosed by a geneticist, the condition does not appear to be inherited.) In addition to the distinctive atrophy that occurs on one side of a patient's face, it can also cause seizures and other neurological problems. The indented line in Christine's forehead -- a feature found in about one-quarter of people with facial hemiatrophy -- is known as coup de sabre, a French phrase that translates as ""cut of a saber"" and evokes a scar that someone who has sustained a gash in a sword fight might be left with. After Christine was diagnosed, Vicki went home and looked up Parry-Romberg on the Internet. What she saw was not comforting. ""There were horrifying pictures,"" she says. ""One side [of a patient's face] was a skeleton and the other side wasn't."" Health.com: Get really inspired . A bleak prognosis . There is no cure for Parry-Romberg syndrome. Nor are there any proven treatments, although drugs that suppress the immune system have been shown to be beneficial in some cases. For two years after Christine's diagnosis, the Honeycutts consulted expert after expert, and all of them told the family that not only was there no cure, but Christine could not have her face reconstructed until the disease stopped progressing, which could take years. By that time, the underlying facial bones might also be affected. ""This was mind-blowing,"" Vicki says. ""She's going to go through adolescence with her face destroyed then they're going to reconstruct it?"" That wasn't good enough for Vicki. Christine was now 11 years old, on the brink of a stage in life that can be tumultuous for even the healthiest and most ordinary kids. So Vicki contacted Dr. John Siebert, M.D., a plastic surgeon whose name she'd come across during her online research. A professor of surgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, Siebert specializes in microsurgery and has operated on about 400 patients with facial asymmetry over the past two decades, 140 of them with Parry-Romberg. He looked at photos of Christine and agreed to operate in November 2010. The Honeycutts made plans to travel to Wisconsin. Health.com: ""Indescribable, crazy pain"": I survived dengue fever . ""Like building a teddy bear"" The surgery took about seven hours. Siebert and his team transplanted tissue -- complete with functioning blood vessels -- from under Christine's left arm and inserted it under her face via an incision in front of her ear. ""It's like building a teddy bear,"" Siebert says. ""The skin and the fur is all there. My job is to give the stuffing to bring out its natural form or shape."" His goal in these surgeries, he adds, is to ""sculpt"" the transplanted tissue and integrate it with the healthy tissue on the other side of a patient's face ""smoothly and gradually, so it looks like it was there all along."" The relocated tissue will grow along with Christine as she matures, Siebert says -- although he can't explain how.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Preliminary charges of financial corruption have been filed against Spain's Princess Cristina for a second time by a judge investigating her husband for alleged diversion of public funds. Judge Jose Castro is leading the investigation at a local court in Palma de Mallorca, in Spain's Balearic Islands. The magistrate brought preliminary charges against the princess in April last year but they were dropped in May, after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court, citing insufficient evidence. But Castro continued his investigation and has now decided to bring preliminary charges again. Prosecutors are once more opposing them. A court spokeswoman confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that the conflict between Castro and the prosecution would automatically see the issue returned to the provincial court. A panel of four judges will then decide whether to uphold the preliminary charges. It is expected that the panel will make a decision ahead of the March 8 court date requested by Castro. The princess's husband, Inaki Urdangarin, is accused of diverting, for private use, public funds earmarked for his nonprofit foundation. Urdangarin, an Olympic medalist in handball, led a private foundation that secured contracts from regional governments to promote sports and tourism. He has faced preliminary charges for more than a year. The preliminary charges could eventually be dropped, but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion. Through their lawyers, the princess and Urdangarin have denied any wrongdoing. Urdangarin was granted the title of Duke of Palma when he married Princess Cristina, King Juan Carlos' youngest daughter, in 1997. The fraud scandal has created unprecedented problems for Spain's popular royal family and kept the country riveted. In April, the royal household revealed that it had asked the government in February to include the monarchy in a new law on transparency -- regarding financing and other activities. The government approved the law in September.","A judge has filed preliminary charges of financial corruption against Spain's Princess Cristina .

"(CNN) -- Last year, on my third trip to the Central African Republic, I met Oumarou, a shy, soft-spoken boy who appeared to be far younger than the 13 years he said he was. He told me he had lived in a nearby village. He and his family had been asleep around dawn when strange men burst into their house. With machetes, they killed his father and brother. As Oumarou ran for his life with his 10-year old brother, Adovan, the men struck a final machete blow on the head of the younger child. The boys hid in the bush for weeks. Somehow little Adovan survived, and the two found their way to an abandoned schoolroom in the troubled town of Bossangoa. People of all ages filled the space -- sitting, sleeping, waiting. Everyone had a similar story: They had seen family members killed, their houses had been set on fire, they had run for their lives, they were surrounded by their attackers, they were not safe. No one dared to guess what would happen to them. They were living from day to day. They were scared and they were hungry. Since that November visit, the Central African Republic has spiraled into deeper chaos and violence -- an unimaginable violence in which children are directly targeted, raped, tortured, mutilated and killed. In 2007 and 2008, I came away from my visits to this remote nation thinking that the women and children of the Central African Republic are surely the most abandoned people on Earth. Marauders and armed militia throughout the country were terrorizing communities. Uncounted thousands of men, women and children were hiding in the forest eating leaves and sucking swamp water. For them, there were no medicines, no schools, no protection from the ever present violence. By the time of my visit in late 2013, things had changed -- for the worse. The violence had taken a more sinister shape along sectarian and ethnic lines, turning communities against each other. As in all conflicts, the most vulnerable, the children, pay the heaviest price. According to the U.N, some of the 690,000 people have been displaced within their homeland while others have escaped into neighboring countries, where they are refugees. Within Central African Republic, every system has crumbled. Malnutrition and disease stalk children . This is a country where impunity reigns. The complete absence of law and order has given even Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army a haven. It could easily be viewed as an open invitation for other extremist groups to set up training camps, including the likes of Nigeria's Boko Haram. Yet in the midst of this grim scenario, there are unsung heroes: Doctors and health workers are risking their lives to save the wounded and the sick. Religious leaders, both Muslim and Christian, are sheltering displaced families regardless of ethnicity or religious preference. Organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and UNICEF are also on the ground. UNICEF is working with local partners to provide lifesaving support to hundreds of thousands of children. But humanitarian needs have outpaced funding. This year, UNICEF appealed for $81 million to help the most vulnerable children in the Central African Republic. At this point, not even half of that amount has been donated. In the face of the enormity of this tragedy, and the many other conflicts around the world, it is understandable that we would feel helpless. However, we should be inspired by the heroism and determination of those frontline humanitarian workers -- and by Oumarou with his little brother and all the innocents who are hungry, hurting and living in terror but who hope for better times. For them, I think we can do better.","Mia Farrow is a UNICEF goodwill ambassador; she focuses on kids devastated by war .

"(CNN) -- The wait is over for Pope Benedict XVI's many Twitter followers, and they have been quick to respond to the much anticipated first tweet from his personal account Wednesday morning. Using the handle @Pontifex -- meaning ""bridge builder"" in Latin -- he posted: ""Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your generous response. I bless all of you from my heart."" A flood of tweets expressing joy, admiration, antagonism and skepticism followed from the Twitterverse, not to mention a fair few jokes. ""Wow! Is this true?! Pope Benedict XVI has started tweeting! Welcome Your Holliness! I'm grateful for your blessing! Follow him!"" tweeted @Joyful_Minoz. ""Our Pope Benedict XVI has a twitter account! Coolest Pope in history!"" wrote @alexaSaclao. ""@pontifex welcome on twitter. Glad you are now reachable to openly discuss gay marriage, birth control and gender equality!"" said ‏@wimremes. Some are more skeptical about the pontiff's personal involvement. Why the Pope and Obama turn to Twitter . ""For the first time in history, a man can communicate directly with some low-level press officer in Vatican,"" tweeted @EsaMakinen. A Vatican official told CNN last week that the pope would compose the tweets for the new account himself. But while the pontiff pressed the button to send his very first tweet, others are expected to send future tweets on his behalf. The pope followed up his first message with two more tweets within minutes. ""How can we celebrate the Year of Faith better in our daily lives?"" asked one. The answer: ""By speaking with Jesus in prayer, listening to what he tells you in the Gospel and looking for him in those in need."" This prompted comment that the pontiff had missed the point about social media being interactive. ""@Pontifex is answering his own tweets now. That's not really how it works, Your Holiness,"" said ‏@exitthelemming. The pope's venture into social media has also sparked a flurry of jokes. Comedy writer Colm Tobin tweeted: ""RT @Pontifex Thou shalt not covet your neighbour's Twitter followers."" ""I hear he's changing it to 'thou shall not covet thy neighbour's wifi,' "" was another tweeter's humorous take. An hour after his first tweet, the pope had around 700,000 followers on his English-language account. He is also tweeting in seven other languages, including Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. This prompted admiration from some fellow tweeters. ""Brilliant that @Pontifex tweets in 8 languages simultaneously incl. Arabic ... : Truly pioneering,"" said @gsurya. ""Not even I could manage 8 Twitter accounts. I suppose @Pontifex has God on his side,"" remarked @BizPaul. However, not everyone was impressed. ""So disappointed that @Pontifex did not write his first tweet in Latin,"" said @laiabalcells. The secretary of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, Monsignor Paul Tighe, told Vatican Radio that the sending of the first tweet was ""an extraordinary moment."" The attention it sparked within the ""Twitterverse"" was quite impressive, he said, with more than 2,000 retweets in under two minutes. Vatican officials said last week that anyone could send in a question to the pope's personal account via the hashtag #askpontifex or #B16. Pope Benedict has some previous experience at tweeting, having launched the official Vatican news site on Twitter, @news_va_en, in June of last year. Other religious leaders have found great success with Twitter. The 140-character limit for tweets allows for short messages, perfect for small verses of scripture or inspiration. The Dalai Lama (@DalaiLama), Rick Warren (@RickWarren), Joel Osteen (@JoelOsteen) and scores of other religious leaders spread their messages via the site. A commentary written by Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi for Vatican Radio last week said: ""140 characters -- the number contained in a tweet -- are quite a few. Most of the verses of the Gospel have less; the beatitudes are much shorter. A little concision isn't bad."" He added that while short messages on Twitter could not carry the whole teachings of the Catholic Church, they would help spread the word to those who wanted to hear. ""Of course the world will not be saved by tweets but among a billion baptised Catholics and among the seven billion people of the world; several million people will be able to feel the Pope is closer in this way too, hearing him say a word for them, a spark of wisdom to bear in their minds and hearts and to share with their twitter friends,"" he wrote. ""A new service of the Gospel."" While Benedict is the first Catholic pope to take to Twitter, he isn't the first twitterized pope. That honor goes to His Holiness Pope Tawadros II, the 118th pope of the Coptic Church of Egypt. But Pope Tawadros has around 6,300 Twitter followers; Benedict had tens of thousands on his first day out. John Paul II, who preceded Benedict, was the first pontiff to use the Internet, and the 20th century saw a string of other milestones for popes using technology to reach the masses. Pope Pius XI made the first papal radio broadcast in 1931. His successor, Pope Pius XII, made the first papal television appearance in 1946. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto, Eric Marrapodi and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","NEW: Pope Benedict's first tweet prompts a range of reactions in the Twitterverse .

"(CNN) -- America is a lucky nation. When the country was about to plunge into an economic depression, the head of the central bank was a man who had dedicated his life to studying how to prevent a recurrence of the Great Depression. And now that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is stepping aside, the economist nominated to succeed him, Janet Yellen, is once again exactly the right person for the challenges of the moment. Yellen, not much more than 5 feet tall, is a towering intellect who commands respect from those who understand the intricacies of monetary policy and can explain them to those of more modest intellectual gifts, a skill that will prove useful when she faces confirmation in the Senate. She will become the first woman to lead America's central bank; an apt way to mark the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve. She will also become the world's most powerful woman. If confirmed, Yellen will likely introduce meaningful, if very subtle, changes to the job. Under the outgoing chairman, the Fed applied innovative and aggressive policies, flooding the financial system by adding trillions of dollars to the central bank's balance sheet and bringing interest rates down to nearly zero to keep the economy from sinking. The worst of that crisis is now over -- unless Congress sends the economy into the abyss. The Fed now confronts two very different challenges. First, how and when to bring interest rates back to more normal levels without triggering a new recession -- the dreaded ""taper."" Second, what, if anything, to do about America's stubborn unemployment rate, which remains at historically high levels. Yellen has a history of voting in line with Bernanke. She is not about to bring any sudden changes to monetary policy. But she has a track record, evidenced by her many academic writings and speeches, that emphasizes the need to create conditions that stimulate employment. Unusual for an economist of her caliber, she has not drifted away into the abstractions of economic analysis and statistics; she has kept her eyes on what's critical -- the people. Her research has centered on unemployment, on the best way to modulate government policies to benefit the people. ""Long term unemployment,"" she told an audience earlier this year, ""is devastating to workers and their families."" With inflation under control and unemployment still high, she said, ""it is entirely appropriate for progress in attaining maximum employment to take center stage."" Those views will influence her work as Fed chairwoman. The Fed has two tasks -- to fight inflation and promote economic growth, including employment. The two are sometimes seen as conflicting with one another. To fight inflation, the Fed usually raises rates. But raising rates tends to depress economic activity. In balancing the two tasks, Yellen will tilt slightly in favor of employment. That means she is more likely to leave interest rates at low levels until unemployment lessens. Yellen's resume is impeccable. She chaired President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, taught at Harvard, and was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. When she went home after work, her mind was not exactly at rest. She shared her evenings with her husband, George Akerlof, a Nobel-winning economist, described by some simply as ""a genius."" He is such a luminary that when she was a professor at the London School of Economics, her former colleagues now admit that they mostly thought of her as Akerlof's wife. In the 1990s, she successfully persuaded then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan that zero inflation would be harmful to the economy. To this day, Greenspan has only the highest praise for her rigorous intellectual analysis and powers of persuasion. Her emphasis on employment qualifies her as an inflation ""dove"" and some critics worry that she will let her guard down if inflation resurfaces. But she has been sharply critical of Fed policies that allowed inflation to rise decades ago, vowing the Fed should never let that happen again. The country might be in better shape today if policymakers had listened to her more carefully. In late 2007 she warned that the economy was about to take a hard fall. Now she has been ranked the best forecaster among all of the Fed's luminaries, and possibly the most qualified Fed chair in history. When the time comes to start raising interest rates, the country will be in good hands. Yellen has said that she plans to go slowly, carefully and in creative ways. She revealed some of her ideas a few months ago, speaking of a plan to raise rates ""in a way that's novel, that we haven't tried in the past."" Essentially, hike the rates the Fed pays to banks in order to gently boost rates across the economy. Yellen is so clearly the right person for the job that it is disappointing the White House handled the entire process in such an undignified way. Traditionally, the selection of the Fed chief has not been subjected to political winds. But the White House let it be known that its first choice for the post was the controversial economist Larry Summers. The trial balloon hissed noisily before it came crashing down. Last month, Summers sent a letter to President Obama asking that his name be withdrawn from consideration in order to avoid an ""acrimonious"" confirmation battle in Congress. The process was unnecessarily disrespectful to Summers and to Yellen. She should have been the president's first and only choice. Lucky for America that the president came to his senses finally. Janet Yellen is about to become a superstar. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","President Obama nominated Janet Yellen to be the next head of the Federal Reserve .

"(CNN)  -- Bill Tilden was a controversial tennis legend who dominated the sport in the 1920s, but died in disgrace. The American achieved fame and fortune through his tennis exploits and befriended Hollywood stars such as Charlie Chaplin, but he spent over a year in jail in the 1940s on a morals charge, which ruined his reputation before his untimely death in 1953. Tilden won his six straight U.S. Open titles from 1920-1925, a record since the tournament abolished the challenge system -- where the champion automatically qualified for the final -- in 1911. Under that system, Richard Sears won the first seven editions of the U.S. Open (then the U.S. National Tennis Championships) in the 1880s. Last year, world No. 1 Roger Federer failed in his bid to match Tilden's record when he was beaten in the final by Juan Martin Del Potro. Tilden, who claimed his seventh U.S. Open title in 1929 as well as being twice a losing finalist, goes down in the history books as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. A relatively late starter, Tilden struggled to get into his college tennis team in Pennsylvania, but years of dedicated practice started to bear fruit after the First World War as he reached the U.S. Open finals of 1918 and 1919. He reached his peak in the 1920s, winning his first U.S. Open title and holding the world number one spot for seven straight years. Tilden also led the United States to a record seven straight Davis Cup titles as well as claiming three Wimbledon titles. His famed ""cannonball"" serves worked particularly well on the fast grass surfaces on which the U.S. Open and Wimbledon were staged. Tilden never won the French Open, being losing finalist in the last year it was held on grass courts, in 1927, and 1930 on clay. He won the last of his 10 grand slam titles at Wimbledon in 1930 before deserting the amateur ranks for the fledging professional circuit . Eventually joined by the likes of Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and Don Budge, Tilden remained a star attraction until well into his 40s, filling arenas such as Madison Square Garden in big-money matches. But off the court, Tilden was a controversial figure, battling with tennis officials as his amateur status was called into question, and he was accused of being arrogant and inconsiderate. Tilden, who never married, saw his reputation destroyed in the 1940s when he was found guilty of a morals charge in connection with a minor. He served seven-and-a-half months of a year's jail term, but was arrested again in 1949 after picking up a 16-year-old male hitchhiker. Tilden served a further 10 months for his probation violation and was shunned by the tennis community. His friendship with Hollywood stars such as Chaplin and a love of the theatrical world saw Tilden pour much of his riches into less-than-successful Broadway productions. He died a tragic figure in 1953, having a stroke in Los Angeles as he prepared for a trip to play in the U.S. Pro Championships despite his 60 years of age. Tilden was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1959, and in any polls of all-time great tennis players he always features in the top order.","Bill Tilden holds record of six straight U.S. Open crowns, but was a controversial figure .

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman says he still gets death threats. He's still accused of racism and he remains a lightning rod for criticism. But in the end, he told CNN, there's only one judge who matters. ""God,"" Zimmerman said in an interview broadcast on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday. ""I know that ultimately, he's the only judge that I have to answer to. ""He knows what happened. I know what happened. So I'd leave it up to him."" It's been seven months since a Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in Trayvon Martin's death. Zimmerman thought his life would go back to normal. Troubles often follow high-profile acquittals . ""I was hoping for that,"" he told Chris Cuomo. But nearly two years after the night when Zimmerman killed 17-year-old Martin in a Florida subdivision, life is anything but the way it used to be for the 30-year-old former neighborhood watchman. His run-ins with law enforcement since the trial's July conclusion have kept his name in the headlines. He's recently drawn renewed criticism for using his notoriety to hawk his own artwork. And now, the man who once aspired to become a police officer tells CNN he's hoping to go back to school and pursue a career as a lawyer ""to stop the miscarriage of justice."" ""I'd like to professionally ... continue my education and hopefully become an attorney,"" he said. ""I think that's the best way to stop the miscarriage of justice that happened to me from happening to somebody else. I don't think it should ever happen to anyone ever again, not one person."" Zimmerman maintains that he acted in self-defense within the law when he shot Martin. And he says he was a scapegoat for ""the government, the President, the attorney general."" Talking about Trayvon with your kids . 'I'm sorry for their loss' Among the misconceptions Zimmerman says still linger about the case: that he's never apologized to Martin's family. He said he still thinks about everybody involved: about Martin's family, and his own. He said he regrets going out that night, but -- citing a pending U.S. Department of Justice civil rights investigation -- says he can't answer whether he regrets killing Martin. He said he'd like to reach out to Martin's family and apologize, like he did during his 2012 bond hearing. ""I would say exactly what I said on the stand,"" he said, ""that I'm sorry for their loss."" At the time, attorneys for Martin's family called the courtroom apology a self-serving act by a man facing a life prison sentence. Now, Zimmerman's no longer facing prison time -- but a string of run-ins with the law since his release have repeatedly sent him back into the spotlight. It started with a speeding ticket. Next, Zimmerman's wife called 911, saying he was threatening her and her father with a gun. There were no charges, but Zimmerman's wife later filed for divorce. Then, Zimmerman's girlfriend accused him of chasing her with a shotgun. This time, Zimmerman called 911, to get his side of the story out. His girlfriend later said she wanted charges dropped and lifted a restraining order against him. Boxing match backlash . Just when Zimmerman's name had faded from the headlines, it came up again this month with reports that he'd be participating in a boxing bout with rapper DMX. After backlash surged, the promoter canceled the fight. Zimmerman says the whole thing was a misunderstanding -- and that there were never any racial overtones when he signed on to do the event for charity. ""It was going to be an unknown person and be a smaller event,"" he said. ""If I went out there and got beat up, the charity was still getting paid,"" he said. ""I don't want to get beat up, but I saw it as an opportunity. I never expected it to be, to turn out the way it did."" Even though his name since the trial has repeatedly made the news, don't expect Zimmerman to comment on current events. Asked by Cuomo to weigh in on the case of Michael Dunn, a Florida man who killed an African-American teen after a dispute over loud music, he said he didn't know enough details. ""I don't watch news anymore,"" he said. ""I watch comedy shows, home improvement shows. So I'm not well enough informed to give you exacts."" A new hobby . During his interview with CNN, Zimmerman's girlfriend and her young daughter wouldn't leave his side. Neither, it seems, will controversy -- thanks, in part, to his new hobby: painting art, and selling it. Zimmerman admits he's pushed to get publicity for his artwork. And it's worked. His first painting sold for more than $100,000 on eBay. ""To be honest, I was hoping to be able to provide a decent lifestyle for my family,"" he said. In an interview that aired on the Spanish-language Univision network Sunday, Zimmerman said he was unemployed, had a personal debt of $2.5 million and wasn't receiving any government benefits. But aside from the possible financial boost, Zimmerman said one painting -- a portrait depicting Special Prosecutor Angela Corey and slamming the U.S. judicial system -- had a deeper purpose. ""It was a creative, tangible forum to show my inner thoughts, my inner feelings. ... It provided a tremendous release for me,"" he said. 'They don't know me' Zimmerman says he still gets death threats. ""I have a lot of people saying that, you know, they guarantee that they're going to kill me and I'll never be a free man,"" he said. ""I realize that they don't know me. They know who I was portrayed to be."" People who accuse him of being racist, he said, don't understand that he was raised by Peruvian family members and that some members of his family are black. ""Before the trial, during and after, I've learned that the majority of people, when they sit down with me one-on-one or with my family, they get a completely different perspective on me,"" he said. But that doesn't change the anger that many people feel about his case, Cuomo told Zimmerman. ""This case became a metaphor, an example. Your face became the face of, 'This is the guy who gets away with killing a black kid,' "" Cuomo said. ""What do you do with that?"" Zimmerman says he'll keep fighting that accusation, for as long as it takes. ""If it takes one person a day at a time to help them realize that's not what this case was about,"" he said, ""then that's what I'll do."" Watch New Day weekdays at 6am-9am ET.

"(CNN) -- The Cherokee County Sheriff's Office on Friday released a second sketch of a man believed to have fatally shot four people in less than a week near Gaffney, South Carolina. Police say the suspect may be driving a light-gray or champagne tan 1991-1994 two-door Ford Explorer. ""Let me say that, under the FBI's definition of a serial killer, yes, we have a serial killer,"" Sheriff Bill Blanton told reporters in Gaffney, a town in the county of about 54,000 residents some 50 miles southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina. He would not detail what has led investigators to conclude the shootings are linked or how they received the description of the suspect that has led to the two sketches. In addition, he said he did not know whether the shooter knew his victims or whether he may have chosen them at random. Police said he may be driving a light-gray or champagne tan 1991-1994 two-door Ford Explorer. The first shooting happened Saturday, when peach farmer Kline W. Cash, 63, was found dead by his wife in their home, said Leigh Caldwell, a victims services coordinator for the sheriff's office. Blanton said Cash's home may have been robbed. On Wednesday, the bound and shot bodies of 83-year-old Hazel Linder and her 50-year-old daughter, Gena Linder Parker, were found in the mother's home, where she lived alone. ""We're still trying to determine if anything's missing from there,"" Blanton said. Thursday night brought two more shooting victims -- 45-year-old Stephen Tyler was found shot dead and his 15-year-old daughter wounded in the family-run furniture and appliance store, Tyler Home Center, said Chief Rick Turner of the Gaffney Police Department. He would not say whether the Tylers were bound. The daughter remained hospitalized Friday, Caldwell said. Leave has been canceled for all members of the Police Department and the Sheriff's Department, said their respective chiefs, who urged residents to take precautions. About 100 investigators from North and South Carolina were working the case, Blanton said. ""I think our community has a right to be concerned,"" he said. ""We're concerned. We're dealing with a man that's killed four people."" He urged residents to check on relatives, especially those who live alone. ""We're asking the people in our community to be vigilant, to report anything."" But he cautioned against taking that too far. ""Our concern is that people are going to start shooting at shadows,"" he said. In a separate incident, police looking for the shooter tried to stop a dark SUV Chevrolet Blazer and wound up with yet another killing, this one apparently self-inflicted. ""The driver, who the officer didn't know at the time was a female, pulled over,"" Blanton said. ""The passenger door opened; two children got out with their hands up."" The children were in their early teens, he said. ""The mother takes off. The officer gives chase thinking maybe she's the suspect. Shots were fired during the chase."" As police cars converged on the SUV, ""Somewhere in the middle she takes her own life,"" he said. ""Right now, we're working it as a self-inflicted gunshot wound, suicide."" Blanton said narcotics were found in the car driven by the woman, whom he identified as a 35-year-old woman from nearby Blacksburg, South Carolina.","Man fatally shoots 4 people in less than a week near Gaffney, South Carolina .

"(CNN) -- A Sunni Islamist militant group claimed responsibility Saturday for a car bomb attack in Lebanon's capital two days earlier which killed four people and injured dozens. The group, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, known as ISIS, said Thursday's suicide blast in southern Beirut was the ""first small payment"" in a bigger push against the Lebanon-based Shiite militia Hezbollah. The al Qaeda-affiliated group has been pushing for a fundamentalist Islamic state carved out of northern Syria, while Hezbollah fighters have been supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's brutal push to crush a rebellion there. The ISIS statement said it targeted ""the Shiite Satan party"" -- meaning Hezbollah -- in order ""to crush its strongholds in the heart of its home in what is called the security zone in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Thursday in a first small payment from the heavy account that is awaiting those wicked criminals."" The residential Harek Hreik district, where the car bomb exploded Thursday, is known as a Hezbollah stronghold. Car bombings in the same area of Beirut in July and August killed dozens and injured hundreds. And in November, a suicide bomb attack outside the Iranian Embassy, close to the neighborhood where Thursday's attack occurred, killed two dozen people and injured about 150. Long-standing tensions in Lebanon have been exacerbated by the civil war raging on its doorstep in Syria, where sectarian divisions reflect those in Lebanon. Regional turmoil . The Lebanese army said Saturday that the alleged chief of another Sunni jihadist group, the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, had died in custody after his health deteriorated. Majed Al-Majed, a Saudi national, was detained in the past few days by the Lebanese army. His group has claimed responsibility for bombings in Lebanon and elsewhere. Beirut-based Middle East analyst Rami Khouri told CNN that the recent surge in violence in Lebanon was part of larger, regional turmoil. ""We are seeing the greatest proxy war of modern times playing itself out in Lebanon and Syria and Iraq, that have now become really one battlefield in which two great ideological camps are fighting to the death like gladiators,"" he said. Political divisions and ideological tensions in Lebanon go back several decades, Khouri said, but they have been reinforced by the emergence of radical Islamist terrorist groups, linked to al Qaeda, following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, was designated as a terrorist group by the United States in 1995. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","A Sunni Islamist group claims responsibility for a suicide bombing in Beirut .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the future of the music business, Taylor Swift sees the glass half-full. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece about the state of the industry, the 24-year-old singer/songwriter puts a hopeful spin on what's to come, declaring herself from the outset to be an optimist. That's not exactly a surprising stance when you consider that she's created an empire on the strength of her pen and persona. With four albums and seven Grammys to her name, Swift earned almost $40 million in 2013 from a combination of albums sold, digital downloads, touring revenue, branding and sponsorships. And when it comes to those album sales, Swift knows that ""piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers ... drastically."" But she also points out that people do still buy records -- just fewer of them. ""They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone,"" she writes. ""The value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace."" It probably goes without saying that Swift does not believe in music for free; it's ""art,"" after all, and ""art is important and rare."" Rather, she hopes for a future in which ""every young girl I meet ... all realize their worth and ask for it"" and predicts that ""individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art."" But album sales are just one piece of the music industry's jumbled puzzle. Artists are also challenged with sustaining interest, a challenge made difficult by younger generations that are ""raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and ... read the last page of the book when we got impatient,"" Swift acknowledges. From the star's perspective, the trick will be in the element of surprise. ""I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?"" she asks. ""In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me."" Instead of signing an autograph, Swift says, just take a selfie. Yet with all of the things that are changing in music, Swift predicts that at least one thing that will stay the same: an intense interest in the artist's personal life. ""There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones,"" she observes. ""There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to."" So 20, 30 or 40 years down the line, where does Swift see herself -- aside from surprising her fans? ""I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism,"" the singer concludes. ""And I'd also like a nice garden.""","Taylor Swift wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on the music industry .

"(CNN) -- World hot dog eating record holders Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut and Sonya ""The Black Widow"" Thomas engaged in a pre-meet stare down Friday as they weighed in for the annual Nathan's July Fourth hot dog eating contest. But for the first time, Chestnut -- who two years ago ate 68 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes -- and Thomas -- the top female eater, with 41 hot dogs and buns -- will not compete directly at Coney Island. In a move to increase the contest's fame, Nathan's is sponsoring separate male and female competitions, in effect setting the plate for Thomas, a Burger King manager who reigns supreme among female hot dog eaters, to finally capture her own championship belt. It is pink, unlike the men's mustard yellow belt, to promote Pepto Bismol, another event sponsor. Male and female contestants will vie for equal purses of $20,000. The annual display of conspicuous consumption is a marketing marvel that captivates the media and has propelled Nathan's Famous to seven consecutive years of higher revenues and profits. During its most recent fiscal year, Nathan's sold about 453 million hot dogs, a 93% increase during the seven-year span, giving it bragging rights as the No. 1 selling beef hot dog at retail outlets across the United States. The company, which is public, has seen its shares rise three-fold during the same period. ""This is one of the greatest marketing stunts ever, ever put forth in the United States,"" proclaimed Wayne Norbitz, president and chief operating officer of Nathan's Famous. ""It's been a great marketing strategy for us."" So great the July Fourth hot dog eating contest and more than a dozen qualifying matches around North America comprise the majority of Nathan's Famous marketing budget. The company airs no television commercials. The hot dog eating contest is a natural for Nathan's, which first opened by the fun-filled amusement park 96 years ago. In the late 1970s the contest was just another Coney Island sideshow, thought up by PR stunt man Max Rosey. Norbitz, a young Nathan's employee in 1977, remembers creating the competition with Rosey in front of the Coney Island restaurant. ""We waited for a couple of fat guys to walk by. We asked if they wanted to eat hot dogs in a contest. They said yes. We ran a quick little contest and the whole object was to get a photo in the New York Post,"" recalled Norbitz. Rosey's protégé, George Shea, his brother Richard Shea and partner David Baer are the marketing mavens who have brought competitive eating -- or gastric-centered sports, as they like to call it -- into the modern era. The marketers introduced the coveted mustard yellow championship belt, arranged for ESPN to telecast the competition live, built up the rivalry between former champion Takeru Kobayashi and current champ Joey Chestnut, and have promoted the ""eaters"" as professional athletes. ""It's absolutely a sport and it has the attendance of a sport, and these guys are athletes for sure,"" claimed Richard Shea. Practicing what they preach, the Sheas have packaged Nathan's hot dog eating competitions, as well as other disciplines including oysters, hamburgers, cheese steak, baby back ribs, buffalo wings, gyros, jalapenos, asparagus, meatballs, sweet corn, catfish and corned beef into a league: Major League Eating. ""The MLE circuit goes on all year and hits all kinds of towns, markets and various foreign shores,"" said Richard Shea, who said he believes his marketing technique breaks through the clutter of traditional advertising and public relations. ""There's so many things you can make competitive, compelling, and then use those as a platform for all these brands looking for eyeballs."" This year's lead stunt for the Sheas is an effort to create a rivalry between the United States and China by bringing Chinese eaters to Coney Island for the July Fourth contest, just when Nathan's happens to be embarking on a major expansion in China. The company recently concluded a deal with a franchisee who plans to open 80 Nathan's Famous outlets in China. ""They represent a potential threat to our possession of the mustard belt,"" warned George Shea. ""China is expanding and rising as a political and global power, economic and otherwise. If they take the belt it's going to hit us right where we breathe. They are going to be eating our lunch, literally."" Champion Joey Chestnut appeared to take Shea's claim seriously. At Friday's weigh-in he confronted one of the Chinese eaters, asking, ""How many are you going to eat?"" ""I hope 20,"" came the response. A clearly relieved Chestnut then offered sportsmanlike encouragement, ""Next year you'll eat more."" The record holder then confessed he could use some tough competition. ""If someone's not pushing me it's hard,"" he said. It appears unlikely Chestnut will have that motivation at the big table in Coney Island. While the Nathan's competition is under way in Brooklyn, Chestnut's chief nemesis Kobayashi plans to stage his own hot dog eating performance at a bar in Manhattan. He was banned from the Nathan's event last year after a contract dispute and then arrested after trying to jump onto the Coney Island stage, generating even more publicity for the eating contest and for Nathan's Famous.","Annual July Fourth eating contest increases sales for Nathan's Famous .

"(CNN) -- Mambwe Kaemba fastens her helmet, pulls on her gloves and rides her red Yamaha motorcycle out of the courtyard of the Ministry of Health. She has already done the daily checks on her motorcycle. Yes, the chain is adjusted correctly, she has fuel and oil. She's now set for a day vaccinating newborns. Her journey will take her over an unmade, potholed track that she has been trained to navigate with ease on her little bike. Kaemba is a health worker in Southern Province, Zambia. She serves about 6,000 people spread over a 20 kilometer area. The fact that she has any kind of transport at all marks her out as being very unusual. When we first met health workers like Kaemba, they told us that when they didn't have a bike -- which was most of the time -- or, when they have a bike and that it had broken down -- almost always -- they couldn't do the job they had been trained for. The health workers who serve rural communities in Africa are some of the most dedicated people in the world. They don't earn much money and often have to live hundreds of miles away from their families. They know that there are people in remote villages who need their help and, when they can't reach them, it's a big burden for them to carry. Often they will walk. Walk for hours at a time. In the sun or rain, across tough terrain, carrying whatever they can manage. They arrive exhausted, knowing that they do not have long before they must return home. It was frustrating to see health workers like Kaemba unable to do their jobs, and women and children who struggle to walk for miles to reach a health center when they get sick. There were motorcycles and ambulances that were broken and rusting, simply because no one was trained on how to look after them properly. This was 20 years ago. The situation was unacceptable and made us angry. It is why we re-mortgaged our home and gave up our careers to start Riders for Health. We took big risks to develop an organization that would try to change the status quo. We knew we could make a difference. It would involve people getting their hands dirty and dealing with spanners and spark plugs and things not normally associated with health care. But this was just as important as investing billions of dollars in developing a new vaccine. Because if the vaccine never reaches the child, what good is it? We started working with our friends and colleagues in the world of motorcycles. To this day, they continue to support our work. We also began working with ministries of health in African countries to put in place technicians, systems for delivering replacement parts and fuel, and training health workers how to look after their own bikes. For programs to be sustainable, they have to have their roots in the local communities. So all our program teams are led and staffed by local people. Riders for Health now has programs in seven countries, transforming health care for 14 million people. This is not charity -- it is a partnership between governments and an organization that can help them to better serve their people. The programs are designed so our partners, including ministries of health, pay for our services. By covering the full cost of running their vehicles, even at a not-for-profit rate, it means countries and their health workers are never without transport. They can budget for it accordingly, knowing exactly how much it will cost. For Kaemba, it means she can do her job well. Health workers like her can now reach far more people. And because they no longer have to walk so much they can spend more time with the people they are caring for. She might only be one woman, with one bike, but Kaemba is a symbol for health care across Africa. If every health worker had access to reliable transport we could reach every man, woman and child. We could transform lives and end deaths from the preventable diseases that kill millions of people each year. We could make sure health care reaches everyone, everywhere. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrea Coleman and Barry Coleman.","Andrea and Barry Coleman: Health workers in rural Africa need help .

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- A massive crowd of demonstrators swelled around an iconic church in the heart of Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, shouting ""down with corruption"" and ""I can live without the World Cup."" CNN affiliate Band News reported that police used tear gas in some areas of the city as clashes erupted. Police initially reported tens of thousands of protesters in Rio de Janeiro but later said the crowds had grown to more than 300,000 people. One death was reported in Sao Paulo state, where a young man was run over by an SUV at an intersection during a demonstration, state police said. Outside the Candelaria Church, organizers called for protesters to march peacefully as they listed a wide variety of demands directed at the South American country's government. In the nation's capital, a group of protesters on Thursday twice forced their way into the foreign ministry building. Police repelled both incursions, but not before protesters lit a fire inside the building, state media reported. Large demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Brasilia came a day after a movement that started as a protest against a 9-cent increase in bus fares scored a major victory. Both Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro agreed to roll back the prices on bus and metro tickets. But will it be too little, too late? The movement has galvanized people across the country who say they're fed up with high taxes and a lack of services -- such as health and education -- while the government spends billions on preparations for the 2014 World Cup. In Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, protesters held signs saying, ""I'd swap 10 stadiums for one decent hospital in this country"" and ""I'd give up the World Cup for better education in my country."" ""Fundamentally, people are on the streets because they have very different demands, but they don't have a forum for expressing them and for being heard. And the bus fares were just one of these many many different things,"" said Alessandra Orofino, one of the protest organizers. Orofino said she hoped this week's protests will mark a turning point in Brazil, where democracy is still relatively young. ""I think that what government hasn't understood is that there will be no single demand that will calm people down, per se. I think fundamentally, if they don't open up, if they don't become more transparent and truly welcoming of participation, people will continue to demonstrate,"" Orofino said. ""It might be for now. It might be in the future, but this isn't going to go away until we have a democracy that works."" Whom does the World Cup benefit? Protesters say the poorest are being short-changed while the government spends the large bills on new stadiums and glitzy infrastructure for the soccer competition Brazil is hosting next year and the Olympic Games coming in 2016. They complain that corruption is driving up the costs. 'The man who made a nation cry' The government responds . The country's investment in those projects includes money for health and public transportation, Deputy Sports Minister Luis Fernandes has said. ""There is absolutely nothing contradictory between organizing a World Cup and investing in health and education,"" he said. An elite National Force, made up of specially trained firefighters and police officers, will deploy to states hosting the games, the Ministry of Justice said late Tuesday. The government has stressed that the force's mission is to mediate and not repress. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff told peaceful protesters Tuesday that their message was being heard. She praised them as active participants in democracy and said her government is committed to ""social transformation."" Police for the most part stood back, and the atmosphere grew festive and loud, with throngs singing and beating drums. Hidden in the peaceful multitudes were bands of rowdies who kicked down doors and broke windows, looted shops and tipped over cars and set them on fire. They left a trail of rubble down the protest routes. While asking police to back off from peaceful protesters, Rousseff has condemned ""isolated and minor acts of violence,"" telling police to confront them ""with vigor."" In light of the protests, the Brazilian president has postponed a trip to Japan, the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency reported Thursday. Rousseff had been scheduled to travel to Japan on June 23-28, the government news agency reported, citing the president's communications secretary. A new date for the trip has not been announced, Agencia Brasil said. Weeks of protests . For nearly two weeks, tens of thousands of Brazilians marched through the streets night after night. Crowds originally protesting bus fares grew into multitudes decrying social injustice on Tuesday, as broad avenues filled to capacity for blocks. The protests come amid the soccer Confederations Cup tournament, a friendly array of matches, in which the host country, Brazil, plays against a small group of national teams from around the globe. The cup serves as a precursor to the World Cup. The majority of marchers are young and well-educated. Matheus Pires, a university student and one of the organizers, says public transportation should be free -- especially in expensive, sprawling cities such as Sao Paulo. ""You can't go to hospital; you can't see your friends; you can't go to school; you can't go to work,"" he said, describing how much the city's residents rely on mass transit. Lowering fares, he said, would prove that the government was listening. But it's too soon to know whether it will bring an end to protests or fuel further and more far-reaching demands.

"(Mental Floss) -- Here are 15 things everyone should know about Fred Rogers: . Every one of Mr. Roger's cardigan sweaters was hand-knitted by Fred Rogers' mother. 1. Even Koko the Gorilla loved him. Most people have heard of Koko, the Stanford-educated gorilla who could speak about 1000 words in American Sign Language, and understand about 2000 in English. What most people don't know, however, is that Koko was an avid Mister Rogers' Neighborhood fan. As Esquire reported, when Fred Rogers took a trip out to meet Koko for his show, not only did she immediately wrap her arms around him and embrace him, she did what she'd always seen him do onscreen: she proceeded to take his shoes off! 2. He made thieves think twice. According to a TV Guide piece on him, Fred Rogers drove a plain old Impala for years. One day, however, the car was stolen from the street near the TV station. When Rogers filed a police report, the story was picked up by every newspaper, radio and media outlet around town. Amazingly, within 48 hours the car was left in the exact spot where it was taken from, with an apology on the dashboard. It read, ""If we'd known it was yours, we never would have taken it."" Mental Floss: Memorable commencement speakers . 3. He watched his figure to the pound. In covering Rogers' daily routine (waking up at 5 a.m.; praying for a few hours for all of his friends and family; studying; writing, making calls and reaching out to every fan who took the time to write him; going for a morning swim; getting on a scale; then really starting his day), writer Tom Junod explained that Mr. Rogers weighed in at exactly 143 pounds every day for the last 30 years of his life. He didn't smoke, didn't drink, didn't eat the flesh of any animals, and was extremely disciplined in his daily routine. And while I'm not sure if any of that was because he'd mostly grown up a chubby, single child, Junod points out that Rogers found beauty in the number 143. According to the piece, Rogers came ""to see that number as a gift... because, as he says, ""the number 143 means 'I love you.' It takes one letter to say 'I' and four letters to say 'love' and three letters to say 'you.' One hundred and forty-three."" 4. He saved both public television and the VCR. Strange but true. When the government wanted to cut public television funds in 1969, the relatively unknown Mister Rogers went to Washington. Almost straight out of a Frank Capra film, his 5-6 minute testimony on how TV had the potential to give kids hope and create more productive citizens was so simple but passionate that even the most gruff politicians were charmed. While the budget should have been cut, the funding instead jumped from $9 to $22 million. Rogers also spoke to Congress, and swayed senators into voting to allow VCR's to record television shows from the home. It was a cantankerous debate at the time, but his argument was that recording a program like his allowed working parents to sit down with their children and watch shows as a family. Mental Floss: Forgotten kids shows sure to give you nightmares . 5. He might have been the most tolerant American ever. Mister Rogers seems to have been almost exactly the same off-screen as he was onscreen. As an ordained Presbyterian minister, and a man of tremendous faith, Mister Rogers preached tolerance first. Whenever he was asked to castigate non-Christians or gays for their differing beliefs, he would instead face them and say, with sincerity, ""God loves you just the way you are."" Often this provoked ire from fundamentalists. 6. He was genuinely curious about others. Mister Rogers was known as one of the toughest interviews because he'd often befriend reporters, asking them tons of questions, taking pictures of them, compiling an album for them at the end of their time together, and calling them after to check in on them and hear about their families. He wasn't concerned with himself, and genuinely loved hearing the life stories of others. And it wasn't just with reporters. Once, on a fancy trip up to a PBS exec's house, he heard the limo driver was going to wait outside for 2 hours, so he insisted the driver come in and join them (which flustered the host). On the way back, Rogers sat up front, and when he learned that they were passing the driver's home on the way, he asked if they could stop in to meet his family. According to the driver, it was one of the best nights of his life the house supposedly lit up when Rogers arrived, and he played jazz piano and bantered with them late into the night. Further, like with the reporters, Rogers sent him notes and kept in touch with the driver for the rest of his life. 7. He was color-blind. Literally. He couldn't see the color blue. Of course, he was also figuratively color-blind, as you probably guessed. As were his parents, who took in a black foster child when Rogers was growing up. Mental Floss: Praise for the blind genius who invented cruise control . 8. He could make a subway car full of strangers sing. Once while rushing to a New York meeting, there were no cabs available, so Rogers and one of his colleagues hopped on the subway. Esquire reported that the car was filled with people, and they assumed they wouldn't be noticed. But when the crowd spotted Rogers, they all simultaneously burst into song, chanting ""It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood."" The result made Rogers smile wide. 9. He got into TV because he hated TV. The first time he turned one on, he saw people angrily throwing pies in each other's faces. He immediately vowed to use the medium for better than that. Over the years he covered topics as varied as why kids shouldn't be scared of a haircut, or the bathroom drain (because you won't fit!), to divorce and war. 10. He was an Ivy League dropout. Rogers moved from Dartmouth to Rollins College to pursue his studies in music. 11. He composed all the songs on the show, and over 200 tunes. 12. He was a perfectionist, and disliked ad libbing. He felt he owed it to children to make sure every word on his show was thought out. 13. Michael Keaton got his start on the show as an assistant. He helped puppeteer and operate the trolley. 14. Several characters on the show are named for his family. Queen Sara is named after Rogers' wife, and the postman Mr. McFeely is named for his maternal grandfather who always talked to him like an adult, and reminded young Fred that he made every day special just by being himself. Sound familiar? It was the same way Mister Rogers closed every show. 15. The sweaters. Every one of the cardigans he wore on the show had been hand-knit by his mother.

"(CNN) -- Iran's lead nuclear negotiator announced a tentative agreement was reached Friday over the implementation of plan that requires Tehran to limit its nuclear program, even as U.S. officials described the talks as ongoing. The conflicting reports came as Iran wrapped up two days of talks in Geneva with the European Union, the United States, China and Russia over how put in place a deal that calls for Tehran to limit its nuclear activities in exchange or a softening of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Negotiators from both sides appeared to make progress, with Iran's lead negotiator -- Abbas Araqchi -- telling state-run Press TV that the two sides reached a tentative deal. Neither Araqchi nor the top negotiator for the six world powers detailed the agreement. If all sides accept the plan, an official announcement will be made within two weeks, Araqchi said, according to the official IRNA news agency. But U.S. officials say while progress has been made, the agreement still needs to be finalized. ""The accurate description would be that they are ongoing. The negotiations are ongoing,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said during a briefing in Washington. The nuclear deal struck in November has been widely hailed as a successful interim measure to stave off an unwanted conflict over Tehran's nuclear program. But after initially celebrating a diplomatic success, Iran has reportedly lashed out at the United States for making public a modified version of the agreement that they say does not reflect Tehran's interpretation. Late last month, Iranian lawmakers drafted a bill that would force the government to enrich uranium up to 60% if new sanctions are imposed, state media reported. The move came only days after bipartisan legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate that would authorize new economic sanctions on Iran if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions. On Friday, the Senate moved toward a veto-proof majority supporting legislation authorizing new economic sanctions on Iran. The bipartisan proposal introduced by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, and Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, now has 59 senators who have formally committed to support it, a senior Senate aide told CNN. The aide said that the current informal count is even higher -- at 77 yes votes -- and that more are expected to come on board once the undecided are forced to vote. A two-thirds majority in both the Senate and House of Representatives is necessary to override a presidential veto. President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any legislation that would authorize new economic sanctions on Iran, saying such a bill at this time would undermine delicate efforts to forge a lasting deal with Tehran. The bill could come to the Senate floor for consideration during the week of Obama's State of the Union address on January 28 or the following week, said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the issue. The proposal would give Obama more than a year to engage in further diplomacy before any new sanctions would kick in against Iran's oil exports and other key areas of its economy, but sanctions would hit sooner if Iran cheats on the interim deal or fails to reach a final accord. The United States and other Western powers believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment. But Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful. CNN's Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto reported from Washington; Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta. Mohammed Tawfeeq also contributed to this report.","Iran's lead negotiator say a plan will be announced within two weeks, state-run media reports .

"(CNN) -- He made his name predicting Germany's 2010 World Cup results, but now Paul the Octopus is returning home to help England's bid to stage the 2018 tournament. England's campaign came off the rails in May when former Football Association chariman David Triesman was forced to stand down after being secretly taped accusing Spain and Russia of bribing referees. His comments put a big dent in the considerable goodwill that had been built by the addition of soccer superstar David Beckham to the campaign team in 2009. Now Paul, who was hatched at an English aquarium in 2008, is lending his particular talents to the bid despite having retired from psychic predictions. ""Paul has spent the last two years of his life in Germany, but he is definitely a proud Englishman and is therefore delighted to put his support behind England 2018,"" Weymouth Sea Life Center manager Nicola Hamilton said on Wednesday. ""We have had a number of football approaches from around the world but Paul was only ever going to choose his homeland."" The cephalopod correctly predicted the outcome of eight consecutive World Cup matches, dooming Germany's hopes when he plumped for Spain in the semifinal and then also in the final. He has since signed book and merchandising deals and is set to appear in a film, all of which will help to raise funds for a sea turtle rescue center on the Greek Island of Zakynthos -- which will also receive a donation from the England 2018 team. ""With his predicting days behind him, Paul is now concentrating on a number of new projects and the England 2018 campaign is something we are sure he feels passionately about. Becoming an official ambassador for the bid is an honor for Paul and everyone at the Sea Life Center,"" Hamilton said. Paul joins music stars Robbie Williams, Sting and former Oasis leader Noel Gallagher as part of the team along with Prince William, Formula One champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. The England bid is one of five seeking to host the 2018 tournament and one of eight hoping to stage the 2022 event, with the decision to be made by world ruling body FIFA in December this year.","Psychic cephalopod backs England's campaign to stage the 2018 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- As a rape survivor, I have always wanted to give voice to victims of violence. But it was only this week, after the publication of a very personal piece on rape, that I understood how important it is to do so. The response to my story about Mathura, a woman at the center of a landmark rape case in India, was overwhelming. On Twitter, on Facebook and on e-mail, the messages kept coming. The girl whose rape changed a country . What stood out were comments like this one from Vilasi Venkatachalam, who tweeted: ""We usually don't care about the afterlife of a rape survivor. Very touching."" Readers thanked me for caring about Mathura enough to embark on a journey to find her after four decades; to find out how her life had turned out. And in reading about her, others were encouraged to talk about their own afterlife. Sarah Silver sent CNN iReport an account of her own rape. She was 20 then and intoxicated one night when a guy she had been casually dating drove her to a covered bridge in the middle of nowhere and demanded she perform oral sex on him. When she refused, he pinned her against a railing and raped her. She spoke of her rape only one time. She was told it ""didn't count"" because she had already had consensual sex with her rapist. And what did she expect when she was so wasted? ""The misogyny present in our culture and cultures all over the world sends the message to survivors that they should not try to be heard because they are inherently responsible for their 'misfortune,'"" Silver wrote in her iReport. ""I was lucky because I survived. I finally accepted the truth that what happened was NOT my fault."" Silver told me she was moved by my story; that it affected her much more than a news article about rape. She was struck by how Mathura never got justice. Her perpetrators, two policemen who claimed innocence, were set free because India's Supreme Court did not believe Mathura's story. Mathura did not scream. She had no visible marks on her body. Therefore, she must have consented. She was, as the court said, ""habituated to sex."" Rape culture. ""It's not going to change unless we talk about it,"" Silver told me. Sunday night I had signed on to Twitter and Facebook and told my followers and friends that the most difficult story I'd ever written had been posted on the CNN website. True, because the story was critical to me. Mathura's case helped spawn a movement to battle sexual assault and triggered significant changes in antiquated rape laws in my homeland. Finding her all these years later was not easy. But perhaps more true because I had never before told anyone about my own rape in college; I broke a 33-year silence in a very public manner. I braced myself for the reaction, from people who are close to me and did not know about what happened to me and also from those who might post comments that were less than sympathetic. I know there is still so much blame put on victims. I also received messages from fellow Indians -- all men -- who were upset with me for writing a ""negative"" story about our homeland. Other men were angry because they felt I was blaming them for the problem of rape. â€ .","Moni Basu's story on a rape survivor in India resonates with readers .

"London, England (CNN) -- Finnish cellphone giant Nokia on Tuesday unveiled its latest range of smartphones as it bids to recover lost ground to rivals Apple and Blackberry. The launch follows a series of major changes at board level, with the recent resignations of chief executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo and smartphone operations chief Anssi Vanjoki. Last week it was announced that Stephen Elop, who previously headed up Microsoft's Business Division, would take over from Kallasvuo on September 20, while Vanjoki, who is credited for revamping the company's smartphone business, would remain in his post until a replacement is found. According to media reports, he was thought to be one of the leading internal candidates for the CEO role. Analysts: Symbian and Android will dominate by 2014 . Nokia chairman to step down in 2012 . ""The time is right to accelerate the company's renewal; to bring in new executive leadership with different skills and strengths in order to drive company success,"" Jorma Ollila, Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors, said in a statement. That renewal process continued at Tuesday's Nokia World showcase in London, when three new smartphones -- the E7, C7 and the C6 -- were introduced. Like the flagship N8 model, unveiled earlier this year, the sleek new devices are powered by a new Symbian 3 operating system which offers hundreds of new features such as the ability to play high definition video through your phone to your wide screen TV at home. Symbian is already the most widely used operating system for mobiles in the world, but Nokia admits competitors such as Apple and Google have started to catch up. ""Today our fight back to smartphone leadership shifts into high gear,"" Niklas Savander, Nokia's markets chief, told delegates in London. ""Despite new competition, Symbian remains the most widely used smartphone platform in the world. Our new family of smartphones introduced today feature the all-new Symbian OS, rewritten to be faster, easier to use, more efficient and more developer friendly."" However technology journalist Kevin Tofel, who attended Nokia World, told CNN that he feels Nokia may stem the loss of market share with their latest offerings but this is ""basically a band-aid."" He added: ""What Nokia is actually saying is MeeGo, their next big announcement and operating system, is really going to shake up the competitors. ""But I'm not hearing anyone from any country raving about the new products at the moment."" With its 12 megapixel camera complete with Carl Zeiss optics, a confident Nokia described the N8 as ""the ultimate entertainment smartphone and world's best cameraphone."" What about the rest of the family? -- Described as the ""ultimate business smartphone,"" the E7 boasts direct, real-time and secure access to corporate email inboxes and other personal applications via its four-inch display with slide-out keyboard. -- The C7 ""social-networking smartphone"" provides live updates from social networks such as Facebook and Twitter on its 3.5-inch touch-screen display. -- The C6 offers a more compact experience which combines elements taken from its bigger cousins, such as a front-facing camera and ClearBlack technology for improved outdoor visibility. All four models will be available in time for the key Christmas period and will have access to the revamped Ovi Store, Nokia's version of Apple's App store where users can download applications, games and videos. Nokia also announced a number of improvements in developer tools making it simpler, easier and more lucrative for people to build and distribute apps. Last week Apple announced it would be removing its unpopular restrictions on what programming tools developers can use to create iOS apps. According to analysts, this means programmers will be able to use tools from Apple's rivals -- most notably Adobe -- to build software for Apple's iPhones, iPads and iPods. ""We have listened to our developers and taken much of their feedback to heart,"" Apple told CNNMoney.com. ""This should give developers the flexibility they want, while preserving the security we need.""","Nokia N8, E7, C7 and the C6 all use new Symbian 3 operating system .

"(CNN) -- I come from Palestine. I have lived my entire life under military occupation, and I have no memory of a time without struggle. I have seen my neighbors beaten, blindfolded, and kidnapped. I have seen children snatched from their mothers in the dead of night. I have seen my brother shot and friend murdered. I can't tell you how this holy land felt before the armored jeeps' rumble. I can't trace a path from here -- from where the Wall surrounds me -- to the sea. But for as long as I can remember, I could not forget. Forget the checkpoints, the harassment, the detentions. Forget that I am not free. Like all prisoners, my memories are what sustain me. But what I need now are new memories. Happy memories. That's why I started filming. I wanted to make memories of my son, Gibreel. I wanted to capture his smile, to chronicle his life in close-up. I wanted to crop out the occupation, the violence, the hopelessness. You know the scenes. Maybe you, too, have captured your loved ones' firsts: the first words, the first steps, the first glimpse of that way he angles his head and grins. Just like his mother. Soraya's gentle voice is in so many scenes of our son's early life. But as I continued filming, Gibreel taught me that there are other sounds more urgent in his world. Read more: How a boy's death brought a West Bank cinema back to life . His first words were ""army"" and ""wall."" His first steps were in the shadow of groaning bulldozers and screeching cranes. Not the kind children play with. The kind that build the colonies that are stealing our land. Our land is Bil'in -- ""a little village on a hillside."" That's how the British described it a century ago, when we had already been there for many more. We are fewer than two thousand people, and we tend the land. We have no factories or office towers. There are no commuter trains or carpool lanes. For centuries, our walk to work has led through biblical fields of olive trees. Read more: Palestinian filmmakers beat the odds to hit silver screen . Then the colonists came. They are -- we hear -- English, French, Swiss, American. Some say there are 50,000 or more. They use our precious water to wash their cars and fill their swimming pools. They seem to thirst for pavement, cold steel, and concrete. And when they weren't satisfied with what they had already stolen, they came looking for more. They came looking in Bil'in. That's when our families stood up and said, ""No."" We did so peacefully, but persistently, through nonviolent protest against the Wall cutting through our land. Throughout, our only power was our conviction. And that conviction drew others -- English, French, Swiss, American. And Israelis. One of them is my friend Guy Davidi, who helped me make a film. Five cameras and as many years later, I invited the world to see scenes from my son's first years-because the story of Gibreel's early life is also the story of Bil'in's resistance. The world calls it a documentary. I call it our story, a Palestinian story. In it, a farmer becomes a filmmaker, and a village stands taller than a Wall. Soon, this Palestinian story will contend for an award. It is a very big award, and many people will be watching. If it wins, what would I say? How does a Palestinian, from a little village on a hillside, address the world? I close my eyes and imagine the scene. There are a billion people, but I see just one. It is you, Gibreel. You are a man, perhaps my age now, looking back at the 35 years that brought you there. What will you see? What will your world look like? And if you had a camera, too, what memories would you make? As the world listens, Gibreel, I want to say to you: I am from Palestine. I have lived my whole life under military occupation, and I have no memory of a time without struggle. But you, son, you will know better times. Someday, you will make new, happy memories. And that will be the true award.

"(CNN) -- A spokesman for Somalia's Islamic party, a militant group in the horn of African nation, has confirmed that the group has merged with the brutal and more hard-line group of Al Shabaab. The spokesman, Mohamed Osman Arus, told the local media in a news conference that his group has essentially been absorbed by Al Shabaab. ""We, the Islamic party, have decided to join Al Shabaab both militarily and principally and the reason is, we want to combine our force and fight against the forces of the transitional government and those of the African union,"" said Arus. Arus said the group's leader, Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, who is on U.N. terror watch list, is among those to have joined Al Shabaab and there will be no Islamic party structure any longer. Members from Al Shabaab are seen to be taking control of all positions previously held by the Islamic party both in and around Mogadishu, according to residents in the capital. Al Shabaab and Hiz bul Islam, as the Islamic party is locally known, have fought bitterly in some parts of southern Somalia. The two groups have struggled for control of the lucrative port city of Kismayo. In all the cycles of fighting, it was the Islamic party or Hiz bul Islam who lost, according to observers. Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report .","Militant party says it is joining with Al Shabaab .

"(CNN) -- The year Stacy London turned 11, she started wearing a turtleneck and long, corduroy pants every day, even in summer. For the next two years, that was her uniform. She was a long way away from being known as a fashion expert who guts people's closets. At the time, she felt like long sleeves and high necks were her only choice: She had woken up one morning with angry psoriasis scales covering her body from neck to toes. It taught her a painful lesson in self-consciousness. ""When my skin disease was at its worst, I hated the summer sun. I was like Emily the Strange. I was like Wednesday Addams,"" she said. ""It was so painful to live with something that there was so little I could do about and at the same time could inflict so much emotional damage. It made me feel like a monster."" Hiding behind clothes and worrying about looks is ""not about vanity when it is a question of identity,"" London said. ""We're worried about it because we're worried about what kind of image we're putting forward, what people are going to think about us. ""People want to be accepted and respected, approved of and loved."" As a fashion expert on TLC's ""What Not to Wear,"" which starts its final season on August 9, London and her colleague Clinton Kelly have seen some tragic attempts to hide what makeover clients see as flaws, whether it's extra weight around their waist or legs they think should be longer. For many, though, it's skin: Chronic conditions such as psoriasis, but also freckles, aging skin, poor circulation, stretch marks, scars and body hair cause skin shame, and make people want to cover up, London said. But how do you dress to suit that? Especially in summer? ""When I was in my 20s, I loved summer clothes,"" said Naked Fashion Help image consultant Carmen Westbrook, from Atlanta. ""I loved wearing short skirts and dresses and showing off my legs. And I'm glad I had that time in my life. ""Now I'm in my 40s, my skin is aging. I don't enjoy summer clothes,"" she said. ""I don't like showing off my skin."" She joked that she might be a vampire, but had to accept it: ""I'm white, that's who I am. I have really pale skin."" Atop a bathing suit, she makes sure to add a fabulous hat and some jewelry, maybe even an elegant cover-up, ""to make it more of an outfit,"" she said. As her clients try to hide their arms, knees, legs and even feet, Westbrook's plan is to focus on the positive and adhere to the advice she learned at the London Image Institute: Show your skinny bits. When ankles, wrists, lower arms and calves are exposed in tasteful ways, everyone looks longer and leaner, Westbrook said, while still covering up the parts of their skin that they don't want to show. ""I tell clients, 'Let's accentuate what we like,"" she said. ""Look in the mirror and focus on one good part. I hope everyone can at least do that."" Clothes used to be the tool London used to hide her skin, but fashion helped saved her, she said. And now she hopes to share the secrets she has learned over the years. ""When style is at its best, it's a wonderful source of confidence,"" London said. ""It becomes a kind of armor."" She teamed up up with AbbVie to launch the ""Uncover Your Confidence"" campaign this week. The website aims to help those with psoriasis, a chronic immune system disease that affects the skin, to feel empowered through fashion advice, empathetic personal testimonies and help finding dermatologists. Style and beauty products are supposed to help you forget about the parts of your body that you perceive as flaws, London said, even if only for a little while. London uses makeup, moisturizer and smart fabric choices to combat her skin troubles. ""These are things that we can do, these little tricks of the trade. You put a shiny moisturizer or foundation on your decolletage area, which can get very wrinkly as you get older, more freckly, liver spotty. But the more shiny moisturizer you use, the more reflective it is, and you see less of those things."" ""Sally Hansen makes a leg foundation that I live by, because for most of my life, my skin has been discolored. If I don't put that on when I'm wearing a dress, it looks like I am wearing blue stockings instead of skin,"" because of poor circulation due to psoriasis. She finds ways to make fads work for her, too. With longer silhouettes strutted into spring and summer collections, maxi dresses, full midi skirts, floaty Bermuda shorts and even jumpsuits made of tissue-thin cotton are all trendy clothing options that look like deliberate fashion choices, but are in actuality cover-ups, London said. ""All of your clothing still has to be chosen with fashion in mind,"" she said. ""Look around you so you know what the trends are, not if they're going to work for you."" ""As I sit here wearing an Isabel Marant Etoile [jumpsuit,]"" London explained, the outfit offers nearly complete body coverage, but because the fabric is cotton and ultra-thin, it's breathable. ""Very, very easy to wear in the swamp-like weather we're having now in New York City, without having to show a lot of skin,"" she said. What else will London be wearing this summer? ""I am all about cotton dresses,"" she said. ""Particularly this season I am obsessed with white. And one of my favorite companies, Dolce Vita, makes these beautiful white cotton dresses. A bunch of their designs have three-quarter sleeves. They're so whisper-thin, the sleeves don't feel like you're in a straight jacket, and you can wear them in the hottest weather.""","Summer fashion leads to anxiety for people with freckles, poor circulation and other conditions .

"New York (CNN) -- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio must have been in a hurry to get somewhere Thursday, according to a local media report that featured video of the mayor's two-car caravan speeding on city streets, blowing through stop signs and violating other traffic laws -- just two days after he announced a traffic-safety initiative. The report by CNN affiliate WCBS, accompanied by the station's exclusive video, said the mayor's car was being driven by a member his security detail, with de Blasio in the passenger seat. If the driver had been cited and convicted for the apparent violations witnessed by its news crew, he could have racked up enough points to have his license suspended, WCBS said. The New York Police Department came to the mayor's defense Thursday in the wake of the WCBS report, releasing a statement. ""The handling of police vehicles transporting any protectee is determined solely by police personnel based on their specialized training in executive protection and professional judgment,"" the NYPD said. ""At certain times, under certain conditions, this training may include the use of techniques such as maintaining speed with the general flow of traffic, and may sometimes include tactics to safely keep two or more police vehicles together in formation when crossing intersections,"" the statement said. The alleged traffic violations came just two days after de Blasio unveiled his ""Vision Zero"" plan, an approach that combines ""education, smarter streets, and strong enforcement to reduce dangerous and illegal behavior on our streets,"" according to the mayor's official website. ""We've put a very bold plan before you and we want the public to know we're holding ourselves to this standard,"" the mayor said at a press conference on Tuesday. ""The likelihood of a fatal crash drops significantly for speeds below 30 miles per hour. So we get those speeds down it will be the difference between losing a life and saving a life,"" de Blasio said. The mayor's office released a statement Thursday in response to news reports about the mayor's speedy trip. ""We believe public safety is everyone's responsibility. We also recognize NYPD's training and protocols, and refer questions related to security and transportation to them. With that in mind, Mayor de Blasio is firmly committed to the traffic safety policies outlined this week,"" De Blasio press secretary Phil Walzak said in a statement.","On Tuesday, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan to make streets safer .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal midfielder Tomas Rosicky has signed a new contract at the Emirates Stadium, the club have announced. The Gunners have not disclosed the length of the deal but it continues the club's success in securing the future services of their key players. The Czech international, who joined the club from Borussia Dortmund in 2006, is the 15th player to sign a new contract for manager Arsene Wenger since May 2009. The deal also rewards the 29-year-old, who has scored 14 goals in 76 appearances, for his performances this season after two injury-blighted campaigns. Rosicky told the club's official Web site: ""The last two seasons haven't been easy for me because of injuries but I feel it speaks volumes about the club's belief in me for this to be signed, and I truly believe I have a lot left to offer the club, my team-mates and all the supporters. ""It's felt like home since I arrived here four years ago and I believe we're on the verge of achieving something special together. ""I'm looking forward to the coming months and hope that together, we are all celebrating at the end of the season."" Rosicky follows Robin van Persie, Abou Diaby, Eduardo, Alex Song, Denilson, Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey in signing new contracts in the past year. Wenger said: ""I have spoken many times of Tomas' class and contribution, not only on the pitch but off it as well, and I very much feel that this new contract reflects that. ""Tomas' vision and touch is remarkable and I know that we will all benefit from his input in the coming seasons.

"(CNN) -- Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes' dazed demeanor during his first court appearance has given rise to a multitude of theories about his mental state, ranging from full-blown psychosis to little more than being ""some freak,"" as one victim of the shooting rampage described him after the hearing. Holmes, with bright orange-dyed hair, appeared to stare blankly off into space for much of the proceedings. At times, he closed his eyes and his head nodded as if he were falling asleep. At others, he opened his eyes wide and looked straight ahead. He never spoke. Holmes is accused of donning head-to-toe protective gear and wielding at least three weapons to kill 12 people and wound 58 in a shooting rampage during an early Friday morning screening of the new Batman movie at a theater in Aurora, Colorado. Authorities say he also rigged a complex and deadly booby trap at his nearby apartment. Opinion: The overwhelming maleness of mass homicide . After the attack, Holmes identified himself to police as ""The Joker,"" Batman's archenemy. Some have speculated the 24-year-old Aurora man was heavily medicated during his initial court appearance Monday. Others have suggested he was in the midst of a psychotic breakdown and hearing voices. Others say he may have just been exhausted, or feigning mental illness to game the judicial system. ""He has no right to come into court looking like he has a sad face. It's not right,"" shooting survivor Corbin Dates said after the hearing. ""The look that he has right now is not something that's going to be believable by anyone."" Holmes may have been medicated, said Chicago clinical psychologist Daniela Schreier. But she said an underlying mental health issue seems likely, as well. HLN: Holmes' defense no strangers to big cases . Some people may think Holmes was a longtime psychopath who turned to violence to show the world he could make a lasting mark, she said. After seeing him in court, though, Schreier said she believes Holmes suffered a psychotic breakdown as recently as this spring, triggering his decision to drop out of graduate school, start buying weapons and launch his attack amid paranoid delusions, she said. If Holmes was on medication, that may have made him appear more drowsy, making it more difficult to get a complete picture of his mental state, she said. Asked Monday whether Holmes was medicated for his court appearance, Arapahoe County Undersheriff David C. Walcher said he did not know, and couldn't reveal that information to the media even if he did. Dr. Mark Levy, a forensic psychiatrist in Mill Valley, California, said he doesn't think Holmes' behavior was due to medication. Instead, he said, Holmes' blank, emotionless expression fits what happens in a psychotic breakdown that severs a person's ability to distinguish reality from fantasy. ""Whatever is happening on the outside of him is like a fly buzzing around the room, something you occasionally take note of,"" he said. The rest of the time, he explained, a person in such a state is inwardly dealing with an invisible roiling chaos, unaware of what's going on around him. Chris Cline, vice president of clinical services at Skyland Trail, a mental health services facility in Atlanta, said it's not clear from Holmes' appearance whether mental illness is a factor. Opinion: Looking into the minds of killers . ""I think we need to see what comes out with more data before we rush to judgment about whether he has a mental illness or something else that's different than that,"" he said Tuesday on CNN. Criminal defense lawyer B.J. Bernstein also cautioned against rushing to judgment. Holmes could be ""bewildered"" as a result of his sudden change in circumstances, or he could just be exhausted, she said. ""I don't take the bizarre behavior yesterday as confirmation of mental illness,"" she said. The issue continued to be a topic of discussion Tuesday, with commenters on CNN and other online venues debating what the unusual appearance meant. ""He's a pathological, homicidal sociopath. He literally has no feelings for those around him,"" said one commenter on CNN.com who went by the screen name JR4. ""Like his acting job in court? He knows that spending life in a psych ward with meds will be a lot better than spending hard time on death row in a maximum security prison."" HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky believes it's likely that Holmes is suffering from some sort of mental illness, and probably should have been on medication if he wasn't already. In many ways, however, he said Monday's court appearance speaks for itself. ""You can draw your own conclusions,"" Pinsky said Monday on his show. ""Not a normal guy."" Remembering the Colorado shooting victims .","The shooting suspect's demeanor in court is instructive, experts say .
James Holmes appeared dazed, emotionless .
Theories range from medication to a complete break with reality, experts say ."
"(CNN) -- Witnesses said a FedEx tractor-trailer truck was already in flames when it crossed a median and slammed into a bus carrying students in Northern California, the National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday night. The driver of a white Nissan Altima that passed the bus just before the crash reported seeing flames coming from underneath the FedEx truck, said Mark Rosekind, an NTSB board member. The truck clipped the car occupied by Joe and Bonnie Duran before it slammed into the bus Thursday evening, killing 10 people -- five high school students, three chaperones and the drivers of both vehicles. More than 30 people, mostly teenagers, were taken to local hospitals. Rosekind, speaking at a press conference, said some bus passengers were ejected from the vehicle, including the ones who died. He said the investigation shows the southbound truck did not brake as it crossed the median at a 10-degree angle and entered the southbound lanes. Investigators found 175 feet of tire marks left by the bus, indicating the driver tried to avoid crashing into the truck. Investigators will look for devices on those vehicles that might provide information about speeds, Rosekind said. One such device -- the electrical control module -- was destroyed by fire on the truck, he said. The electrical control module on the bus survived but ""we don't know what's actually on there,"" he said. The truck transmission might also be examined to help determine that vehicle's speed, he said. Blood samples should be obtained from the bodies of both drivers, which will provide information about whether drugs or alcohol might have been in their systems, he said. Blood samples also might tell investigators if the drivers had inhaled smoke from the fire, he said. He stressed that investigators are only collecting information now and aren't coming to conclusions about the cause of the accident. Bonnie Duran told the CNN affiliate KOVR the truck was on fire before it hit the bus. She said she made a quick decision to swerve to avoid a direct hit from the truck, sending their rental car into a ditch. ""Somehow we survived,"" she said. Her husband said it was like a scene from a movie. ""I looked over and saw the FedEx truck coming straight for me,"" Joe Duran told the affiliate. ""It was like a 3-D movie. Imagine a Mack truck coming out of a movie."" The Durans were hospitalized and released. Students traveling from the L.A. area . The students were traveling from the Los Angeles area to take part in a program at Humboldt State University, which allows prospective attendees to visit the campus. Their journey ended in the fiery wreck 90 miles north of Sacramento when the truck hit one of three buses taking the teens to the campus in Arcarta. The students on the buses represented 31 Southern California high schools. They were heading to ""Spring Preview Plus,"" which invites low-income and first-generation prospective students to the university. As part of the program, students stay in residence halls, attend events and visit with staff and students from a program that helps historically underrepresented students, the university said. The two other buses in the caravan made it to the university. Those students were placed in dorms, and the university is offering them counseling.

"LAS VEGAS (CNN) -- Seven Republican presidential candidates engaged in a sometimes contentious debate Tuesday in Las Vegas, Nevada, as bad blood boiled between front-runners and the surging Herman Cain found his opponents taking aim at his tax plan. Here are five things we learned from the debate: . Why 9-9-9 was No. 1: A rise in the polls brings more scrutiny, so we knew that Cain's ""9-9-9"" tax plan would come under attack from his rivals. And we didn't have to wait long for the full frontal assault. In response to the first question of the debate, from an audience member asking the candidates their ""position on replacing the federal income tax with a federal sales tax,"" the other candidates were quick to pile on and rip apart Cain's much-touted proposal to reform the country's tax code, a plan which has helped the former Godfather's Pizza CEO surge in the polls. The six other candidates sharing the stage with Cain fired away, terming the plan as risky and simplistic. ""Anytime you give the Congress a brand-new tax, it doesn't go away,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. ""Herman's well-meaning, and I love his boldness,"" said former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. ""I give him credit for -- for starting a debate, but it's not good for families."" ""Herman, I love you, brother, but let me tell you something, you don't need to have a big analysis to figure this thing out. Go to New Hampshire, where they don't have a sales tax, and you're fixing to give them one,"" said Texas Gov. Rick Perry. ""Herman. It's not going to fly."" said Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. ""It's very, very dangerous. And it will raise more revenues,"" said Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. ""The analysis I did, person by person, return by return, is that middle-income people see higher taxes under your plan,"" said former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Cain repeatedly defended his plan, saying it would not raise taxes on poor people, and said his opponents were misrepresenting his proposal. ""The reason that our plan is being attacked so much is because lobbyists, accountants, politicians -- they don't want to throw out the current tax code and put in something that's simple and fair,"" responded Cain. After the debate, Cain said he was happy with his defense of his plan, but promised a more comprehensive proposal would follow, and he added that the attacks on him are proof that he's now a front-runner in the race for the nomination. Romney gave as good as he got: We knew Romney would be under the microscope, but the attacks from his fellow candidates seemed a bit more vicious in Las Vegas. Call it a Wild West shootout along the Strip, with Romney the target. Romney and Santorum got into a shouting match over the Massachusetts health care measure passed when Romney was governor. The plan, known as 'RomneyCare,' has been attacked by fellow Republicans as the genesis for the much-hated national health care law pushed by President Barack Obama and passed by a Democratic-controlled Congress. ""You can't change the facts,"" shouted Santorum. ""Rick, you had your chance. Let me speak,"" fired back Romney. ""You're out of time. You're out of time,"" responded Santorum. Romney and Perry were involved in another dust-up a few minutes later, with Perry saying on the issue of illegal immigration, ""Mitt, you lose all of your standing, from my perspective, because you hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year. And the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on immigration is, on its face, the height of hypocrisy."" A shouting match ensued, with Perry interrupting Romney and Romney firing back ""Rick, again, Rick again, I'm speaking,"" and adding this zinger: . ""This has been a tough couple of debates for Rick, and I understand that. And so you're going to get testy."" Romney gave as good as he got, but the fact that ""RomneyCare"" keeps coming up must be frustrating for him and a concern for his campaign. iReporter more impressed with GOP field after debate . Rick Perry finally woke up: Perry's poor debate performances over the past month are a major reason why he's faded in national polling. The Las Vegas debate may be the moment when he started to turn things around. One thing's for sure, Perry's still got plenty of fight left in him. Perry didn't even wait for the questioning to begin to start going on the attack. He zinged Romney during the candidate self-introductions, saying that he was ""an authentic conservative, not a conservative of convenience."" As mentioned, Perry and Romney got into a shouting match over illegal immigration, and they also battled over jobs. ""Mitt, while you were the governor of Massachusetts in that period of time, you were 47th in the nation in job creation. During that same period of time, we created 20 times more jobs,"" charged Perry. Ray Sullivan, Perry's communications director, told reporters in the post-debate spin room that the Texas governor wasn't too aggressive in his attacks against Romney, adding that ""I think the governor spoke from the heart."" Asked if Perry was presidential in his approach at the debate, Sullivan said ""I think he was Rick Perry in his approach and that's a good thing for us."" Eric Ferhnstrom, Romney's senior adviser, disagreed, telling reporters that ""Rick Perry had a strategy coming into this debate to kill Mitt, and he ended up killing himself."" iReporter wants more attention paid to Ron Paul . Rick Santorum's the fighter: He's low in the polls and he isn't rich with campaign cash, but Santorum's excelling at going on the attack and grabbing attention at the debates. Santorum hammered Romney over the Massachusetts health care law, saying ""You just don't have credibility. Your consultants helped craft Obamacare."" He slammed Cain over the ""9-9-9"" plan, saying ""Herman's well-meaning, and I love his boldness, and it's great. But the fact of the matter is, I mean, reports are now out that 84 percent of Americans would pay more taxes under his plan. That's the analysis."" Plus, he went after both Perry and Romney over the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as the Wall Street bailout, which is despised by conservatives. ""The problem is -- in the first place, is that several people up here, the, quote, ""businesspeople,"" supported the TARP, supported the bailout. Governors Perry, Romney,"" said Santorum. Santorum may be low down in the field, but the good news for him is that there are plenty of debates ahead, including three next month. iReporter saw very little new . Immigration questions not going away: This was supposed to be an election about jobs and the economy, but the topic of illegal immigration continues to rear its head on the campaign trail and in debates. Perry's poll numbers cratered in September after he defended a law in Texas that offers in-state college tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants -- a clear sign that Republican primary voters continue to be deeply concerned about the issue. Perry tried to throw the issue back at Romney on Tuesday by criticizing his rival for hiring illegal immigrants to do work on his lawn, a controversy uncovered by the Boston Globe during Romney's first presidential bid in 2008. ""Mitt, you lose all of your standing, from my perspective, because you hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year,"" Perry said, turning straight to Romney. ""And the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy."" Romney admitted that a landscaping company he hired did employ illegal immigrants, but he said he fired the company when he found out. Keen on scoring points with GOP voters, the candidates were united in saying that Obama has failed to fix the immigration system. I think the person who really has a problem with illegal immigration in the country is President Obama,"" Bachmann said. ""It's his uncle and his aunt who are illegal aliens who've been allowed to stay in this country, despite the fact that they're illegal.""","GOP contenders attack Herman Cain's ""9-9-9"" tax plan .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Outside Independence Hall, ask a graduate student in line to see the Liberty Bell what he thinks of gerrymandering, and you might get this answer: . ""I think Gerry Mandering is a great guy."" No, he isn't. Gerrymandering is the term for the way politicians draw boundary lines for legislative districts in a way designed to keep one party or the other in power in that particular district. In the last 10 years, 78% of the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives -- almost four out of every five members of Congress -- did not change party hands even once. In California, with 53 seats -- the most in the nation -- incumbents were kept so safe that only one of those seats changed party control in the past decade. David Wasserman, redistricting expert for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, says only 20 races for Congress are expected to be tossups in the 2012 election. That's only 20 out of the 435 seats in the House. ""In general elections, it's almost rigged,"" he said. More on the history behind gerrymandering . The lines are redrawn for seats in Congress each 10 years after the U.S. Census measures population shifts. That process is going on now in states across the country. Among CNN's findings: . The South . Race has been used to create a political divide in the South. In the five Deep Dixie states -- South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana -- only nine Democrats are left in Congress. Only one is white. He is Georgia Democrat John Barrow, and Republican control in that state's legislature has led to his home city of Savannah being excluded from his current district. In 2010, Republicans captured control of North Carolina's legislature for the first time since shortly after the Civil War. They drew district lines in a way to pack 49% of all of North Carolina's African-American voters in just three of the state's 13 congressional districts. That left the other 10 districts mostly white and predictably Republican. Democrats in North Carolina accuse the GOP of political ""resegregation."" A court battle is looming. Illinois . After the GOP landslide in 2010, this is the only battleground state winning or losing a seat where Democrats remain in control. They pushed through their new map over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. Most of the five freshmen Republicans elected to Congress last time will face difficult races to return for a second term. Nowhere is gerrymandering more apparent than in Chicago's 4th District, where a grassy strip hardly a football field wide, stuck in between two expressways, connects the top and bottom halves of a district designed to keep a Hispanic in Congress. According to the 4th District Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat, Chicago has an Irish district, a Polish district, a Jewish district and three black districts. Look at a map and all have irregular, unusual lines. This is not a matter of party control. All the incumbents are Democrats. The lines preserve racial and ethnic heritages. In Illinois, it is the GOP that is suing Democrats to try to overturn the new map. California . Voters have revolted. In 2010, they passed an amendment to the state constitution to take redistricting out of political hands and have a citizens commission redraw the lines. It was forbidden to favor incumbents. As a result, more than half of California's 53 representatives were placed in the same district with another colleague for the 2012 election. As many as 15 could lose or else face retirement to avoid losing. ""Fifteen out of 53 does not sound like a lot,"" Wasserman said. ""But compared to most other states, that's an avalanche."" Party politics did give way to social politics. Latinos, who accounted for most of California's population growth, could win as many as nine seats next year. The African-American population shrank, but under pressure, the citizens commission retained the three traditionally black seats in south Los Angeles. Florida . Voter reform met resistance here. Three million people voted to pass amendments last year that say the legislature cannot not favor or penalize incumbents or political parties when it redraws the lines. Two members of Congress -- Democrat Corrine Brown, who is African-American, and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart, who is Hispanic -- filed a lawsuit in federal court to try to overturn what the voters had done. Florida's House of Representatives, using taxpayer money, hired a law firm to support them in opposing the taxpayers' will. Their argument: The U.S. Constitution has given the legislature the sole responsibility for redistricting. A federal judge rejected that argument and threw out the lawsuit. But the two incumbents, supported by the legislature, are appealing, and they say the case could go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Iowa . For three decades now, Iowa has had a nonpartisan redistricting system. Two legislative staffers draw the maps in secrecy without political interference. ""In Iowa, it is understood incumbent protection is not the name of the game,"" one of those staffers said. As a result, Iowa has the nation's only congressional race next year where a longtime Republican incumbent, Tom Latham, is paired against a longtime Democratic incumbent, Leonard Boswell. Past voting patterns indicate they could be separated by no more than 1%, either way. Iowans like it this way, and that includes Latham. He said, ""I think if you sit in a very safe district, a lot of times these people will ignore the public will. They won't have to listen because they can do whatever they want to, and vote however they want to, and not be held accountable for it."" As Wasserman put it, ""Americans are basically between the ideological 40-yard lines. But the districts aren't. And that's part of the reason Congress is so polarized.""","Redistricting is ""almost rigged"" to favor parties in power, expert says .

"(CNN) -- Hosts Argentina remain winless at the 2011 Copa America after being held to a 0-0 draw by Colombia in Sante Fe on Wednesday. The result left Sergio Batista's team second in Group A on two points, with Hernan Gomez's Colombia leading the way on four. Striker Dayro Moreno wasted a golden opportunity to give Colombia all three points, but the 25-year-old could only fire wide from 12 yards with the goal gaping. It was another frustrating result for two-time world champions Argentina, after La Albiceleste could only draw 1-1 with Bolivia in their opening match. Despite calling on attacking talents such as FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, Manchester City's Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero of Atletico Madrid, Argentina were unable to truly trouble Luis Martinez in the Colombia goal. The home team's night was summed up on 80 minutes, when Barcelona's Messi blazed a free kick 20 yards over the crossbar from the corner of the penalty area. A win for Bolivia in Thursday's other Group A clash against Costa Rica will mean Argentina have to secure three points in their final group game -- against Costa Rica -- to stand any chance of progressing into the quarterfinals. ""No one expected this kind of game,"" Batista told the tournament's official web site. ""Nothing comes out the way we expected. ""We have a game against Costa Rica, and we can have five points to qualify. We need to keep calm, think it is a final and come out with this mentality."" Batista, who was part of Argentina's World Cup winning squad in 1986, also defended Messi, who has struggled to replicate his stunning club form for the national team.

"(CNN) -- A woman who says she twice worked for L.A. Clippers co-owner Donald Sterling sued him this week, alleging that he sexually harassed her and made her uncomfortable with racist remarks -- and that he once fired her after she objected. Maiko Maya King's lawsuit, filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges she and Sterling were in a romantic relationship from 2005 to 2011, and that she ""worked for him and his foundation"" before her irritation at what she claims were his racially offensive remarks split them apart. King alleges Sterling made racist comments about her former husband, who is black, and about the couple's children. ""Why would you bring black people into the world?"" Sterling allegedly said, according to the lawsuit. The suit also alleges Sterling said: ""I want to take you out of the black world and put you into the white world."" Referring to King's former relationship, Sterling would tell her, ""You ran away with a black boy,"" including once at a table full of people at a restaurant, according to the lawsuit. In addition, the lawsuit quotes Sterling as allegedly telling King that she had ""moved to the ghetto"" and that ""Black people do not take care of their children. All they do is sit at home and smoke dope."" An attorney for Sterling, Bobby Samini, told CNN that King's claim was ""baseless and ridiculous."" ""She was never employed by Donald Sterling,"" he said. ""Her claim was obviously prompted by opportunistic motives."" Gloria Allred, King's attorney, told CNN Tuesday that her client has ""quite a bit of evidence. We have voice mails. We have texts."" Allred said King returned to work for Sterling after having a ""problematic relationship"" with him because she knew his girlfriend was V. Stiviano, the woman who released his now-infamous audio recording. ""She knew V. Stiviano was his girlfriend and she felt then she wouldn't have to have sex with him and she came back into his employ as his caretaker, "" Allred said. The lawsuit claims that after King re-established contact with Sterling in late 2013, he hired her as his ""personal assistant/caretaker"" with an agreement to pay her $10,000 a month. However, the suit says, he ""dangled money only if she would have sex with him,"" and she ""refused to perform many of the acts."" ""She was introduced as his caretaker. And she was promised wages and she was not paid those wages. So she is entitled to be paid for her work, and that's what this lawsuit is all about,"" Allred said. Sterling fired her after she protested against the alleged sexual harassment and racist remarks he allegedly made, the suit says. The lawsuit said King was at Sterling's home one day when he was on the phone with former NBA star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson and she heard him make ""derogatory comments of a sexual and racial nature"" about Johnson. Sterling's public troubles began in April when TMZ posted a recording in which he was heard making racist comments. Sterling's inflammatory remarks to Stiviano spawned outrage among NBA fans, players and executives. Chief among the latter was NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise. Sterling, an attorney and billionaire real estate mogul, is now fighting to keep his co-ownership of the NBA franchise. In the recording, Sterling argues with Stiviano about how she posted a photo of herself with Johnson to Instagram. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" Sterling says. ""If it's white people, it's OK?"" the woman responds. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?"" Bird was also an NBA star who played with the Boston Celtics and a storied rival of Johnson, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers. Sterling's camp, in turn, has filed a lawsuit, claiming that the NBA move to terminate his ownership ""is unconstitutional, in breach of contract, in restraint of trade, in breach of fiduciary duties and ... is malicious and oppressive."" The lawsuit seeks more than $1 billion from the NBA for its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise. It comes amid fresh questions about the 80-year-old's mental state, raising the issue of how much control he has or should have with the Clipppers. Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, last week agreed to sell the Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion. Official: Suspect in alleged Stiviano assault surrenders .

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Kashi Shodeinde turned the ignition and his battered truck convulsed as black fumes poured from the exhaust. His precious cargo of bottled Guinness beer rattled as he set off into the gauntlet of Lagos' potholed roads and traffic. Nigeria consumes more Guinness beer than Ireland, the company says. Working for a foreign company to send his three children to school, Shodeinde is on the frontline of private investors' struggle to gain a foothold in Nigeria. ""In the whole of Nigeria, Guinness is No. 1!"" he exclaimed. Brewed in Nigeria since 1962, the country's thicker-tasting ""Foreign Extra"" is not just supporting Shodeinde and his family, but helped Guinness Nigeria defy the global recession with 6 percent annual growth this year, according to the company. Nigeria now drinks more Guinness than Ireland -- making it the second-biggest consumer in the world, after Britain, according to Guinness Nigeria. A success story like Guinness in Nigeria highlights the potential for trade and foreign investment in Africa that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about last week when she addressed an African trade convention in Kenya. ""Africa is capable, and is making economic progress. In fact, one doesn't have to look far to see that Africa is ripe with opportunities, some already realized, and others waiting to be seized together if we determine to do so,"" Clinton said. She is on a tour of Africa to promote development and good governance, and to underscore the Obama administration's commitment to Africa. Nigeria is one of several countries on her itinerary. But many challenges keep foreign businesses from coming to Nigeria. Regarded as a frontier market, Nigeria is ranked 118 out of 187 in the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" rankings. Failing infrastructure, irregular electricity and erratic government policies have caused foreign investors to shy from Nigeria's relatively untapped market of 150 million people. ""Nigeria remains an information dark spot and therefore does itself no advantage in terms of trying to attract foreign investment,"" said Doyin Salami, an economist at Lagos Business School. The Dunlop and Michelin tire companies have in recent years closed their factories in Nigeria, because of the rising cost of production. Yet, Nigeria Guinness is expanding its facilities to increase production. ""Business is really growing,"" said Afebuameh Cephas, the plant manager for Guinness' Benin factory, saying production was up almost 30 percent in a year. All the ingredients are produced locally -- except for Guinness extract, a secret ingredient added to Guinness brewed anywhere in the world. But there's no secret to Guinness' Nigeria success, said Chairman Tunde Savage. ""The most important thing here is you have to be very transparent in what you do. Your governing principle must be very clear here. You must ensure you do things correctly and rightly."" Fortunately for competitors, Guinness is not to everyone's taste. Bottles of all shapes and flavors rattled on a bar table in Lagos one recent night as a band struck a deep bass note in the humidity of the night. ""It's too harsh! It's too harsh!"" one regular exclaimed. ""It tastes good for an African man!"" argued another.","Guinness beer plant in Nigeria expanding facilities as business thrives .

"(CNN) -- An apparent tornado touched down Saturday afternoon in a small town east of Kansas City, Missouri, blowing roofs off houses and toppling trees and power poles, the National Weather Service said. There was no immediate word on injuries in the town of Orrick, but law enforcement officials are checking house-to-house to make sure everyone is accounted for, said Sgt. Collin Stosberg with the Missouri Highway Patrol. The damage appeared to be typical for a tornado, but a determination on whether it was indeed a twister and the scale would have to wait another day, said Rich Thompson, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Residents reported seeing a funnel cloud, Thompson told CNN. Debris was scattered throughout the town. A silo crashed to the ground and trees were either ripped out of the ground or torn in half. Residents looked stunned as they surveyed the damage. Amy and Jerry McNary discovered their two Australian shepherd puppies, amazingly, were alive in their open-air enclosure, though a bit muddy. The McNarys' chicken coop next to the dogs was turned upside down, but all 15 chickens were unhurt. Their yard was full of storm debris. ""It's bad. It's a mess,"" Jerry McNary told CNN Kansas CIty affiliate KSHB. ""The rest of the town doesn't look any better. His wife said the town of about 900 will recover. Orrick is about 30 miles east of Kansas City. ""Orrick's a good community,"" Amy McNary told KSHB. ""I'm sure everyone will help out. We have a strong community here."" Stosberg said 80% of the town was affected. Authorities said they won't allow nonresidents for 48 hours. Because power lines were downed, Kansas City Power & Light deliberately shut off electricity to the area until the damage can be assessed.","Residents say the town of 900 will recover .

"Jindo, South Korea (CNN) -- Jin Woo-hyuk had a pimple on his forehead. He was skinny and wore braces. When divers found the teenager's body in the submerged ship, he was wearing a pair of jeans and a light green hoodie. The simple, human details about Woo-hyuk are noted on a whiteboard, which catalogues descriptions of the bodies recovered from the sunken ferry Sewol. Some of the victims, still unidentified, are known just by a number. No. 63 was a female student with a flower-shaped belly ring and Adidas sweatpants. No. 62, another girl, had a long pony tail and wore black rosary beads. They were among the 325 students from a South Korean high school on board the ferry that sank April 16, making up two thirds of the passengers of the ship. Only 75 of the students were rescued. The remaining 250 are dead or missing. 'Big brother, you have to live' The students attended Danwon High School in Ansan, a city about an hour's drive south from the capital, Seoul. The school has lost the majority of its junior year, as well as a dozen teachers. Signs of mourning are everywhere in the surrounding neighborhood. Yellow ribbons are tied to the school gate, symbolizing hope and solidarity with the dead and missing students' families. A shrine of flowers and hundreds of notes to the dead decorate the school's entrance. ""Big brother, you have to live, you have to come back,"" read one note. ""I want to see you,"" another read. ""I love you and pray for you."" Many of the messages from other students expressed regret at not being able to help their classmates on the ferry that was traveling from the port city of Incheon to Jeju, a southern resort island, when it began to list and then capsized. 'It all hurts too much' Funerals of students have been taking place in recent days. Before the ceremonies, the hearses have driven into the school grounds for one last visit, a portrait of the dead teenager carried by a person in the passenger seat. The trauma of the ferry disaster has affected local residents. ""I feel my heart is being ripped up,"" said Ryu Chang-ryul, who has lived near the school for nine years. ""For three days I haven't eaten. It all hurts too much."" Kim Young-sook runs a small restaurant near the school. She dressed in black and wept as she spoke with CNN, explaining that students are regular customers. She played a video of a 17-year-old boy she said was like a son to her. ""He used to call me auntie,"" she said. ""He was sitting here playing guitar talking about just how important this trip was to him. I feel so bad that I could not be there. All of us, we could have done something."" Students return to school . A makeshift memorial has been set up in a nearby basketball gymnasium, where hundreds of people file past a wall of flowers in which dozens of photos of dead and missing students are mounted. As well as local visitors, people have driven down from other cities like Seoul to pay their respects. The school reopened Thursday, but only for students in the final year. About 100 psychiatrists and support staff from across South Korea were on hand to counsel them. Some of the teenagers arrived in hoods or wore caps to cover their faces as they made their way past journalists. Mental health care professionals will be available to the students for at least two months, said Dr. Kim Hyun-sook, head of the community mental health program in the region. ""Koreans, when they experience trauma, they feel anger and sadness but they tend to bottle it up,"" he said. ""We're trying to encourage emotional communication to let those feelings out."" A mother's pain . The parents of the dead and missing, meanwhile, cling to photos and videos of their lost loved ones. Christine Kim taught English to some of the students. Her youngest daughter, Billy, was on board the ferry. A video on Kim's cell phone shows Billy hula-hooping while wearing a dalmation costume -- a fun-loving teenager. Billy got her boyish name because she loved goats when she was little, her mother said. Last week, Kim looked out to sea from Jindo and called for her daughter.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- After concerns over a revamped Google privacy policy surfaced last month, some questioned whether the Web giant is still living up to its longstanding motto: ""Don't be evil."" Absolutely, says Vic Gundotra, the man behind social network Google+. The company has to. ""If we do things that are evil, with one click you can leave Google,"" Gundotra said on the opening day of the South by Southwest Interactive festival on Friday. ""If we break the users' trust, we can lose to competitors very quickly."" Under the policy, which went into effect on March 1, Google doesn't collect any more information about users than it did before. But all of that data, from tools like Gmail, Google search, YouTube and Android mobile devices, is now compiled into a single profile of each user's habits. Privacy watchdogs, including some members of Congress and dozens of state attorneys general, have expressed concerns the policy is too invasive. Gundotra said Google+ is an important part of the ""new Google"" that will use those profiles to provide more relevant services (advertisements were the ones that came up again and again) across the company's many platforms. Before, he said, Google products were developed in ""silos,"" unable to share information with each other. ""There are some things Google could have done better,"" he said. ""If we could build a common notion of your identity and your relationships, we thought, we could make Google better."" For example, he said, on Google+ user could ""+1"" (the site's equivalent of a ""like"") a restaurant. Months later, a friend could be using Google search to find a restaurant in the same area and discover it as a recommendation of sorts. Gundotra, a senior vice-president for engineering at Google, also used his ""fireside chat"" with tech writer and Alltop.com co-founder Guy Kawasaki to defend the success of Google+. Last month, Web analytics firm comScore released a report saying that Google+ users averaged just 3.3 minutes on the site for the entire month of January. That came just weeks after Google CEO Eric Schmidt announced the site had hit 90 million users -- up from 40 million in October. ""Google+ is a social layer across all of Google's services,"" Gundotra said. Gundotra said the site now has 100 million ""30-day actives."" But when pressed by Kawasaki for a definition, he said that's people who log in to Google+, then use one of Google's many other products within a month. So, then, not only does Google+ plus have dramatically fewer than the more than 800 million users Facebook claims, but that return rate doesn't even mean people actually came back to Google+? Gundotra said it's not legitimate to only study Google+ return visits as a measure of the network's success. ""That's counting only one aspect,"" he said. ""We think that's crazy."" Instead of a Facebook-like standalone network, Google+ works to make all of the Google universe social, he said . That didn't stop him taking a thinly veiled jab at Facebook when asked about allowing developers to create third-party content on Google+ (Think FarmVille, Spotify or Pinterest). Google has been slow to do so. Gundotra said he wants to make sure the months-old service's programming system is ready before opening it up to outside developers. In contrast, he suggested, Facebook has made several sweeping changes to its interface, sometimes forcing developers to start over from scratch. ""I'm going to release that (programming interface) when I know we're not going to screw over developers,"" he said. ""We hold ourselves to a higher standard. Sometimes that means restraint.""","The man behind social network Google+ defends the company's privacy policy at SXSW .

"(CNN) -- In my 20s, after my doctor performed a laparoscopy to examine my uterus and ovaries, he gave me a videotape of the procedure. I dubbed it ""Madame Ovary,"" threw a party and screened it for my friends. Three years ago, when my doctor sent me to have a colonoscopy, the last thing on my mind was seeing footage from the exam. At 39, I was mortified about having a procedure that I associated with older people. I didn't even want to talk about it, let alone see it. But March is National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, so I'm coming clean. While drinking two liters of liquid that tastes like dirty sea water to evacuate my bowels doesn't rank highly on my list of things to do, neither does dying from colon cancer. And having a colonoscopy, although unpleasant and embarrassing, was one of the best things I have ever done for my health. Of all cancers affecting both men and women, colorectal cancer -- cancer of the colon or rectum -- is the second-leading killer in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overall, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is 1 in 20, and up to 150,000 new cases a year are reported in the United States, the American Cancer Society says. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that removing precancerous growths spotted during a colonoscopy can cut the risk of dying from colon cancer in half. More than 95% of tumors are detected during a colonoscopy. Yet despite these statistics, people feel squeamish about the exam and tend to put it off. ""It's a potentially embarrassing procedure. It's not like an eye exam in terms of personal exposure,"" said Dr. Anthony N. Kalloo, the director of gastroenterology and hepatology at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The American Cancer Society and the American College of Physicians recommend that adults be screened for colorectal cancer starting at age 50. Doctors urge people with a family history of colon cancer to begin screening much earlier. I guess I'm an overachiever. While I don't have a family history of that kind of cancer, I did have one of the common symptoms -- bleeding, a change in bowel habits, weight loss, poor appetite, bloating and/or abdominal pain -- that sent me running to my family doctor. He referred me to St. Jude's Knott Family Endoscopy Center in Fullerton, California, for a colonoscopy. I can't describe the pure joy I felt at receiving THAT news. I didn't know too much about the procedure but what I did know sounded horrible. During a colonoscopy, a doctor examines the inside of the colon and rectum by inserting a colonoscope, a thin, flexible instrument that sends images to a TV screen or computer. In order for the doctor to do a thorough exam, the patient needs to prepare by fasting; I drank only liquids the day before the exam. He or she may also be required to chug down a solution that will ... let's just say keep them at home, near a bathroom. ""It literally takes a whole day away from your life, where you could be doing normal things and instead you are drinking this bowel prep that is uncomfortable and that limits your social life,"" Kalloo said. Following the instructions I was given, I started fasting the day before the procedure. I was restricted to certain fluids and particular colors of Jell-O (nothing red or purple.) I spent the morning longing for my usual massive cup of coffee and substantial breakfast and instead downed water, Gatorade and chicken broth. Around 5 p.m., the fun really started. I began drinking a liter of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) bowel prep. I had to down 8 ounces of this stuff every 15 minutes followed by 16 ounces of clear liquid. I drank another liter several hours later while trying not to vomit. The manufacturers said the solution was lemon-flavored; it really resembled a noxious mix of chemicals that I can still taste to this day. Dr. Gene Yoon, my gastroenterologist, concedes that for most patients, the preparation is the worst part. Yoon and other physicians now use magnesium citrate, which he said requires patients to drink less, is easier to tolerate and works just as well. By the time I arrived at the Knott Family Endoscopy Center the next morning, I was nervous and praying the worst was over. It was. I don't remember anything past the point where I was sedated. An IV solution sent me into a ""twilight sleep."" It also made me forget the procedure, which no doubt was for the best. When I woke up, I was groggy but I also felt incredibly well rested. I had only a small amount of discomfort, including abdominal cramping that doctors say is normal. I don't remember getting dressed or leaving the hospital. But in my daze, I asked my father to swing by Starbucks to pick up a cup of coffee and a sandwich. When I got home, I dozed for a few hours and that was that. Yoon called the next day with my results: He'd found and removed a 1.5 centimeter villous adenoma polyp from my sigmoid colon. After examining the polyp, Yoon estimated that there was a more than a 50% chance of that polyp becoming malignant. Yoon removed the polyp before that had a chance of happening. Of all the polyps, villous adenomas are associated with the highest mortality and morbidity rate. I consider myself extremely lucky I had a symptom. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have had a colonoscopy until I was at least 50 -- and who knows how long I would have put it off after that. ""Colon cancer is one of the few cancers that can actually be prevented, mainly because it goes through this polyp stage before it turns into colon cancer,"" Yoon says. Given what he'd found, Yoon suggested that my younger brother also have a colonoscopy. Craig had his colonoscopy when he was 36; the doctors didn't find anything. Two important people in my life, my husband's stepfather and my trainer, have had colon cancer. For both of them, the cancer was detected during routine colonoscopies. I thank God they were proactive about their health. Polyps are slow-growing and asymptomatic, Yoon says. The cancer can also be slow-growing and asymptomatic -- until it starts spreading. ""Usually once you start developing symptoms from colon cancer, things are way too late,"" he said. Eating a high-fat diet, consuming red meat and smoking will increase your risk of developing colorectal cancer, as is a familial history of the disease. Doctors recommend exercising and eating a diet rich in vegetables, fruit and fiber. At Hopkins, researchers are looking into the role that curcumin - a spice commonly used in India - may play in reducing the risk of colon cancer. Preclinical and laboratory tests show it may be useful, Kalloo said. I've always loved curry, and I'm thinking about ways to incorporate this spice into our meals. But even if you play by the rules of healthy living, it's important to get screened. ""We have to do better,"" Kalloo says. ""Family care physicians and everyone who sees patients should ask someone over 50, 'Have you had a colonoscopy?' It's just not a convenient test. Even physicians tend to procrastinate."" After Yoon called me with the results, I sent a thank you note to my family doctor, telling him how much I appreciated him referring me for a colonoscopy. Yoon's office called me recently to set up another appointment. I'm not looking forward to it, but there's no question I will do it again. Considering the alternative, I'd be crazy not to.","March is National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- One million free text messages will be sent every day for 12 months from Monday in South Africa in a bid to raise HIV awareness and encourage testing for the disease. Former South African president Nelson Mandela launched a similar cell phone initiative in 2003. The ambitious Project Masiluleke is being rolled out across the country after a pilot period that saw calls to a AIDS national helpline shoot up by 200 percent,  organizers say. The United Nations estimates that there are currently six million people living with HIV in South Africa and just one in 10 get the treatment they need. ""South Africa is the epicenter of the global HIV epidemic,"" said HIV activist Zinny Thabethe in Octorber at an annual conference for the social innovation network Pop!Tech, an organization instrumental in developing the concept. 'Project Masiluleke,' or 'Project M' was set up to try to encourage people to seek testing and treatment in a country where cell phones are abundant. Africa is cited as the fastest growing mobile-phone network in the world. In South Africa, more than 80 percent of the population has one -- the country has a population of 49 million, and it is estimated that 43 million have cell phones. Almost 95 percent of the phones are prepaid. The initiative plans to broadcast millions of health messages every month to phones across South Africa. ""This is the largest ever use of cell phones for health information,"" said Gustav Praekelt, one of the project's originators. ""There is near universal coverage,"" said Praekelt during the launch of the project. ""And in the absence of other services, the mobile phone has become the central component for people to get access to information."" Organizers say 'Project M' will offer South Africans the privacy to get tested and pursue treatment options and counseling by staff who are HIV positive themselves. The system sends the messages using a so-called ""Please Call Me"" (PCM) service. This free form of text messaging, common across Africa, allows someone without any phone credit to send a text to a friend asking them to call. Each sent PCM message has the words ""Please Call Me,"" the phone number of the caller, and space for an additional 120 characters. The extra space is normally filled with advertising, which helps offset the cost of running the service. The message reads: ""Frequently sick, tired, losing weight and scared that you might be HIV positive? Please call AIDS Helpline 0800012322."" Encouraging people to get tested is a huge challenge in a country where people with the AIDS virus still face stigma and shame. However, 'Project M' appears to be having an impact, since it was initiated in October. ""We have observed a dramatic increase in the call rate to the AIDS Helpline -- from approximately 1,300 calls per day to a new average of 3,600,"" said Milo Zama, Projects Development Manager for LifeLine, one of the partners. Trained operators provide callers with accurate healthcare information, and referrals to local testing clinics . Many of the messages are broadcast in English and in local languages such as Zulu. As well as Pop!Tech, the project has been developed and funded by HIV charities and technology and design firms, including Nokia Siemens, MTN, the Praekelt Foundation, iTeach and National Geographic. Pop!Tech's Director of Communications Jason Rzepka told CNN there are plans to expand the project to other affected countries after its official launch in February 2009. He said: ""One of the objectives of the February launch event will be to secure additional funding, so we can continue to expand Project Masiluleke into its planned 2nd and 3rd phases beyond South Africa.""","One million free texts will be sent every day for 12 months from Monday .

"(CNN) -- Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo is an outspoken critic of international aid, arguing for years that foreign handouts stifle Africa's development, perpetuate corruption and hinder the continent's growth. A New York Times bestselling author, Moyo first grabbed international headlines with her 2009 book ""Dead Aid: Why Aid is Not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa."" Since then, she's penned two more books, on the subject of the decline of the West, and the effects of China's commodities rush. In a new interview with CNN's Robyn Curnow, Moyo explains why she's optimistic about the future of Africa. She looks at the positive impact that China can have on the continent and details the key drivers that will spur Africa's economic growth. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: The aid debate is so different from before ... Dambisa Moyo: So much has happened in the last five years -- whether you're in Africa, South America or Asia, nobody talks about aid anymore. Policy makers themselves are going out and issuing debts in the market. My own country, Zambia, did a fantastic bond, a $750 million 10-year bond, last September. The discussion is so much more about job creation and investment, which is such a fantastic story and it's obviously partly to do with the fact that the traditional donors are having a financial problem, fiscal problem, on their balance sheets. They just don't have the capital anymore to hand out cash like they did in the past. CNN: The Chinese story has been thrown into the mix, has that changed the landscape? DM: Yes, absolutely, but in a strange way it's exactly what we need in terms of delivering economic growth and meaningfully reducing poverty. We need jobs, we need investment, we need trade, we need foreign direct investment, whether investment domestically but also from the outside. It's not some magic pill, everybody knows that this is the formula, and finally the Chinese are showing up, again, not just in Africa, but around the world with that elixir, that mix of opportunities to really transform these countries. Remember, 70% of the populations of these places is under the age of 24. There is no escape: we have to create jobs. Read this: How 'Afropreneurs' will shape Africa's future . CNN: A lot of people are critical of Chinese ""neo-colonialism"" but you argue that's not the case. DM: Well, it's not, because China has so many economic problems in itself. You know, this is a population of 1.3 billion people with 300 million people that live at the level of Western living style. So they've got a billion people to move out of poverty. The notion that they would be spending their time trying to colonize other places is just, frankly, absurd. I'm not saying that China should be given a red carpet, carte blanche, to come into Africa or, indeed, anywhere in the world, and do what they like. We do need the investment, we need job creation and we do need actual trade in these places. But I think what's really essential is to focus on what China can do for Africa, as well as what Africa can do for China. And I think that discussion is not had as objectively as it should be. Ultimately, the responsibility of how China engages in Africa is really at the domain of the African governments. We would not be worried about the risks of neo-colonialism or abuse, environmental abuse and labor issues, if we trusted the African governments to do the right thing. CNN: How do you see the trends playing out in the next decades? DM: I'm an eternal optimist. I'm probably the wrong person to ask, because I do believe that the structural and fundamental structures of Africa right now are poised for a very good few decades. If you look at an economy through the lens of capital, which is basically money; labor, which is basically how many people do you have and what skills do they have; and productivity, which is just, how efficiently they use capital and labor, the trend is very clearly in favor of Africa. Read this: African CEOs look to bright future . We've got a very solid fiscal story. The debt-to-GDP ratios in Africa today at the sovereign level are nowhere near the burdens that we are seeing in Europe and the United States. The labor story is very positive -- 60-70% of Africans are under the age of 25. So a young population dynamically needs to be leveraged, so definitely we need to invest in skills and education to make sure that we get the best out of this young population. And then, in terms of productivity, this continent is a great absorber of technologies and all the things that can help us become more efficient. Therefore, these three key drivers: capital, labor, and productivity, help spur economic growth. Now is it going to be smooth sailing? Of course not -- there will be volatility, but I think the real investors in Africa will be able to make a delineation between risk and uncertainty. CNN: And it's about a country's resources, too, right? DM: That's a brilliant question, because actually the answer is no. I think it's really about the structural things that I mentioned: capital, labor, productivity. Why do I say that? Let's take a look at the African stock market. There are about 20 stock exchanges in Africa and about 1,000 stocks that trade in Africa -- 85% of them are non-commodities. We're talking about banking, we're talking about insurance, we're talking about retail, we're talking about consumer goods, logistics companies, telecommunications companies, those are the stocks that are on the African stock market. CNN: Do you feel a sense of responsibility to represent the African success story? DM: Well, I suppose, for me, I feel a responsibility to tell the truth. This is a great continent. I went to primary school on this continent, secondary school, university, I've worked on this continent and I think that it's a great disservice that, for whatever reason, people have usurped an imagery of Africa that is absolutely incorrect. They focus on war, disease, corruption and poverty. That is not all about Africa and I think it's really essential if we're going to turn the corner, we need to take that responsibility, as governments, as citizens, not just Africans, global citizens to say, ""that's actually not true."" There are more poor people in India than there are in Africa; more poor people in China than there are in Africa, but somehow there's a stigma for decades that's been associated with the African continent that is completely unjustified -- and it's that I find objectionable.","Dambisa Moyo is a Zambian economist, investment strategist and author .

"(CNN) -- There's nothing worse than seeing your ex on top of the world while you're down in the dumps. For two former halves of a sporting power couple, their fortunes could barely be more contrasting. While Danish tennis ace Caroline Wozniacki crashed out of the French Open in the first round, her former fiancee Rory McIlroy has been playing some of the finest golf of his career. The Northern Irishman broke off his engagement to Wozniacki on May 22 -- ending a three-year relationship -- before going on to win the European Tour's flagship event -- the BMW PGA Championship -- on Sunday thanks to an imperious final-round 66 at Wentworth. McIlroy upped his game further on Thursday, posting a nine-under par opening round 63 at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio. The world No. 6 leads the field by three strokes, having missed out on the course record by two, and his stranglehold on the Jack Nicklaus event could have been even tighter had he not tweaked his left knee on the seventh hole. ""This has been coming,"" McIlroy, who will be attempting to win the U.S. Open for the second time in his career when it begins at Pinehurst on June 12, told the PGA Tour's official website. ""My performances have been really good, been shooting really good scores. There's just been runs of holes in tournaments where I haven't played so well and I've shot it four or five over in the space of nine holes, and that's really just derailed my tournament. ""Last week I just didn't do that and that's down to nothing more than hitting good golf shots and hitting good putts and limiting my mistakes whenever I get in trouble on the golf course."" McIlroy showed little sign of being hampered by his knee injury, which was picked up during his second shot at the seventh.""I wear spikes, so sometimes your foot can get stuck in the ground and you can torque your knee a little too much,"" explained the 25-year-old. ""I think that's what I did, I tweaked it. The inside of it is sore, it's a little swollen. I'll go see the physio and get some treatment and get ice on it, and hopefully it will be OK for tomorrow."" Double Masters champion Bubba Watson, his fellow American Chris Kirk and Englishman Paul Casey are in a three-way tie for second, one shot ahead of 2011 PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley.","Rory McIlroy leads the Memorial Tournament by three shots after opening round .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in the United Arab Emirates should ""retract their decision to cancel the residency permits of dozens of Syrians who took part in a peaceful protest against the Syrian government in Dubai,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement Friday. On February 10, more than 2000 people protested against the Syrian regime in Dubai. As the demonstrators didn't have a permit to protest, Dubai police asked them to leave. According to a source close to the leadership of the Syrian National Council, which opposes the Syrian government, most left, but dozens stayed behind and continued protesting. About 60 Syrians had their residency permits revoked, the source told CNN on Monday. In their statement, HRW said the UAE canceled the residency permits of about 50 Syrians for demonstrating. But a United Arab Emirates official told CNN on Monday that the number of Syrians affected was much lower. ""The decision was not to renew the residence of a few people -- much less than 60. It was around 30,"" said the official, who did not want to be identified. ""It was not to deport them or to send them to Syria. It was to give them the option to go anywhere they wish."" The official said authorities could have arrested hundreds because ""the demonstration was not licensed. It was not legal. Nevertheless, nobody touched anybody, nobody was arrested."" He added that the Syrians who lost residency permits had been ""involved in other activities"" -- but would not detail what those activities were. In their statement, HRW said, ""the UAE government has shown little tolerance for public demonstrations or strikes, regardless of whether they are peaceful."" In the UAE, gatherings and demonstrations are not allowed without a government permit. The source close to the SNC leadership told CNN that while the protesters who stayed ""were in the wrong"" for not leaving when told to do so, but ""that doesn't mean the UAE needs to cancel their residencies."" The source said the SNC has been negotiating with the UAE's foreign ministry and was assured last week that the permits would be reinstated -- but that has not happened. He said protesters are ""asking for mercy from UAE authorities, as this won't just affect the men whose residencies were canceled -- but their families as well."" The United Arab Emirates is one of the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries to have expelled Syrian envoys and to have recalled their Ambassadors from Syria in response to the government's crackdown there. ""The UAE calls on Syrian President Assad to respect the right of peaceful protesters, yet it is expelling Syrians from its country for exercising this basic right,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, in HRW's statement. Added Whitson, ""these expulsions show that Emirati authorities are intolerant of any protest or expression of dissent on UAE soil even if it is not geared toward them."" A Syrian who left after Emirati officials gave him 10 days to depart told CNN earlier this week that he is worried about his future. ""I lived and worked in the UAE for years, all my family is there. I never did anything wrong,"" said the man who did not want to be named out of fear for his family. According to HRW, other Syrian nationals in the UAE are not speaking out about their expulsion because they are afraid they will be deported to Syria. The rights group said, ""Syrian protesters forced out of the UAE face a significant risk to their personal security if they return to Syria. ... The protesters also are at risk of persecution on return to Syria if Syrian authorities find out they protested against the regime or the circumstances of their expulsion."" The source close to the SNC leadership, said UAE authorities gave the Syrians a deadline of this past February 29 to leave the country, and that at least five have left the UAE in recent days -- including two to Egypt, two to Jordan and one to Saudi Arabia, he said. The UAE official said the deadline is ""flexible."" According to HRW, at least 10 of the protesters had to leave the UAE, with ""some of them going to Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar."" The rights group added they do not have any information indicating that anyone was sent back to Syria. The UAE official who spoke to CNN said none of those asked to leave the country had been deported to Syria.

"(CNN)  -- The mascot for the 2012 European soccer championship co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine has been officially unveiled: a pair of footballing brothers wearing the jerseys of each nation. Critics might say that UEFA and its design company Warner Bros. have hardly displayed originality, because the mascot for Euro 2008, co-hosted by Austria and Switzerland, was twin brothers ""Trix and Flix."" But love them or hate them, the spiky-haired pair will doubtless make a small fortune in memorabilia and associated sales for the 2012 organizers and Europe's ruling body. The use and marketing of commercially-designed mascots at major football competitions began in 1966 for the World Cup held in England, who beat West Germany 4-2 in the final. Flushed by that success, the ""World Cup Willie"" mascot proved an immediate hit and helped swell the coffers of the English Football Association, so it was inevitable that the innovation was here to stay. But while Willie is acknowledged to be a creative masterpiece, particularly for its time, others have been panned by the critics. CNN has compiled a football team's line-up of them to compare the best and the worst in our photo gallery. Feel free to add your own contributions in the comment box below. 1. World Cup Willie (1966 World Cup, England) The first, and some people say, best of all football mascots, although the choice of United Kingdom red, white and blue for the lion's outfit, when the tournament was hosted by England alone, was in retrospect a strange decision. 2. Tip and Tap (1974 World Cup, Germany) The 1974 hosts kitted out two boys in the white shirts of the national team, emblazoned with the initials WM (Weltermeisterschaft) -- which is German for World Cup. Although it has the look of a hastily-drawn cartoon, it brought good luck to the hosts who beat the Netherlands 2-1 in the final. 3. Jerboas (2011 Asian Cup, Qatar) Next year's Asian Cup of Nations in Doha has a whole family of mascots. Jerboas are a rodent found in the desert in that area, which does not inspire confidence in the overall concept. 4. Footix (1998 World Cup, France) The cockerel, a national symbol of France, was a natural choice for a mascot -- and by the end of the competition it was crowing very loudly as the hosts upset Brazil 3-0 in the final. 5. Zakumi (2010 World Cup, South Africa) ""Zakumi is a jolly, self-confident, adventurous, spontaneous, and actually quite shrewd little fellow. He loves to perform and always follows his instinct and intuition, yet sometimes has the tendency to exaggerate a bit,"" said the blurb on FIFA's official website. Love him or hate him, he made a lot of money for football's world governing body, whose revenues now top $1 billion per year. 6. The Spheriks (2002 World Cup, Japan and South Korea) Apparently the first computer-generated mascots, the Spheriks were an acquired taste and appeared to be based on Pokemon figures which were popular at the time. 7. Striker (1994 World Cup, United States) The American public, who clearly adore dogs, voted for the loveable animal which, like World Cup Willie, wore the red, white and blue of the hosts. Some might say it proved a pup. 8. Benelucky (Euro 2000, Belgium and Netherlands) It's always a problem for co-hosts of tournaments to design mascots or logos which can fit both national identities. The clue to this mascot is in the name. Benelux countries Belgium and the Netherlands put on the 2000 European Championship. An odd mix of a lion with a devil's horn and tail. 9. Pique 1986  (1996 World Cup, Mexico) The Mexicans were awarded the competition -- only 16 years after their 1970 staging -- when Colombia pulled out. The mascot has a last-minute look to it and, designed in the shape of a jalapeno pepper with a mustache and sombrero, reinforced a national stereotype. 10. Trix and Flix (Euro 2008, Austria and Switzerland) The androgynous twin brothers did not confine themselves to on-field activities. They also appeared in an animated music video by Shaggy, who penned the official song of Euro 2008 ""Like a Superstar."" Neither the mascots nor the video lived up to the name. 11. Yet to be named (Euro 2012, Ukraine and Poland) The public can vote for the names of another set of mascot brothers on UEFA's official website. The result will be announced on 2004.","The 1966 World Cup saw the first competition mascot named ""World Cup Willie""

"Madrid (CNN) -- A Spanish judge has again indicted three U.S. soldiers in connection with the death of a Spanish TV cameraman in Iraq in 2003, according to a court order viewed by CNN Wednesday. The long-running case stems from the death of the cameraman, Jose Couso in Baghdad in 2003. U.S. troops assaulted the Iraqi capital and directed tank fire against the Palestine Hotel, where journalists covering the war were staying. The three U.S. soldiers were first indicted by the judge in 2007. The case was closed in 2008 but reopened last year after Couso's family appealed to Spain's Supreme Court. The latest indictment, dated Tuesday but made public on Wednesday, alleges that the three U.S. troops were linked to U.S. tank fire directed against the hotel, where Couso was videotaping the battle. He died from his wounds shortly afterward. The three, identified as Philip de Camp, Phillip Wolford and Thomas Gibson, were assigned to the U.S. 3rd Infantry, based in Fort Stewart, Georgia. In addition to Couso, the tank fire on April 8, 2003, also killed a Reuters cameraman, Ukrainian-born Taras Protsyuk. National Court Judge Santiago Pedraz issued the latest indictment and also ordered the three soldiers to each post bond of one million euros ($1.33 million) within 24 hours or face an embargo order on their assets, the court order said. In addition, the judge placed two senior U.S. officers, identified as Buford Blount and Col. David Perkins, under official investigation in the case, which is a step short of an indictment under Spanish law. Couso's family and some journalists have blamed the U.S. military, saying they should have known the Palestine Hotel, a tall structure in Baghdad, was a base for journalists, not combatants. Then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said American troops fired only after receiving hostile fire from the hotel and the matter received the highest attention, from then-President George W. Bush and then-Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar. Couso's lawyer has previously said it would be difficult to put the three indicted soldiers -- the tank commander, a sergeant, and a superior officer -- on trial in Spain. The Pentagon, faced with similar charges from other national courts in the past, has not turned over American soldiers. Earlier in the long legal battle, a three-judge panel at the National Court in 2006 ruled that Spain had no jurisdiction in the case. The judges ruled that U.S. troops thought they were firing on Iraqis at the hotel serving as spotters for Iraqi artillery fire aimed at American troops, and that the civilian deaths were not intentional.","NEW: A national court judge ordered the soldiers to post a 1 million euro bond .

"(CNN) -- A month after carrying out one of the largest anti-piracy crackdowns ever, federal authorities have added charges and broadened their case against the defendants. The 90-page superseding indictment, which was returned Thursday in the Eastern District of Virginia, adds counts of criminal copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud against Megaupload.com and Megavideo.com. The websites were shut and several of their alleged leaders were arrested in January. The defendants allegedly reproduced copyrighted works from third-party websites, including from YouTube.com, so that they could be copied and distributed via Megavideo.com and to give the false impression that the website hosted content that was primarily generated by users and was not copyright-infringing content, the indictment says. ""In contrast to legitimate Internet distributors of copyrighted content, Megaupload.com does not make any significant payments to the copyright owners of the many thousands of works that are willfully reproduced and distributed on he Mega Sites each and every day,"" the government says. In addition, the document says that the defendants' claim of more than 180 million registered users is not supported by their own records, which show only 66.6 million registered users as of January 19. Those records also show that just 5.86 million of these users ever uploaded a file to Megaupload.com or Megavideo.com, meaning that more than 90% of the sites' registered users used the systems solely to download, it says. Among those indicted is Kim Dotcom, the founder of Megaupload. His lawyer said after the initial indictment that his client is innocent, a law-abiding entrepreneur committed to raising his young family in New Zealand. Dotcom is a resident of New Zealand, where he employs more than 50 staff, and Hong Kong, where he has a suite at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The superseding indictment cited the case of one alleged infringer referred identified only as ""VV."" Over six years, VV had uploaded nearly 17,000 files to Megavideo.com, which resulted in more than 334 million views, it said. Though VV had been the subject of numerous takedown e-mails, none of those files had been deleted, it said. The government also added property, bank accounts, jet skis, jewelry and watches to the list of assets subject to forfeiture, and estimated the value at at least $175 million. The defendants were first charged in a five-count indictment returned on Jan. 5 and unsealed on Jan. 19. The counts were: conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to commit copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and two counts of copyright infringement. Five of the seven individuals indicted have been arrested, and at least $50 million in assets have been ""restrained,"" the Department of Justice said in a news release. Last month, Megaupload's fans turned the table on the feds. ""Hacktivist"" collective Anonymous said it set its sights on the U.S. Department of Justice and apparently knocked the agency's website offline. The DOJ website glitches came soon after various Twitter accounts associated with Anonymous took aim at the agency. Anonymous's favorite weapon for these attacks is a ""distributed denial of service"" (DDoS) attack, which directs traffic to a website and overwhelms its servers, causing it to crash. The practice involves neither hacking nor any breach of security. It was Anonymous' largest attack ever, according to an Anonymous representative, with 5,635 people using a networking tool called a ""low orbit ion cannon."" A LOIC is software tool that aims a flood of traffic at a targeted site. Authorities said the ""Mega Conspiracy"" organization had generated more than $175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships. According to the indictment, Megaupload, which launched in 2005, was once the 13th most-visited website on the Internet, serving as a hub for distribution of copyrighted television shows, images, computer software and video games. The site's popular MegaVideo subsidiary was widely known in tech circles for its broad selection of pirated content, including movies and episodes of hit TV shows. To shut Megaupload, federal authorities executed 20 search warrants in eight countries, seizing 18 domain names and $50 million worth of assets, including servers located in Virginia, Washington, the Netherlands and Canada. The individuals indicted are citizens of New Zealand, Germany, Slovakia and the Netherlands. No U.S. citizens were named. However, Megaupload has servers in Ashburn, Virginia, and Washington, which prompted the Virginia-based investigation.","New counts include copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit money laundering .

"(CNN) -- By now, both the rules and deadly consequences of NekNominate -- the online drinking game of one-upmanship that has already resulted in at least five deaths -- have gone viral. The game has players sharing videos of themselves downing boozy concoctions, usually mixed with something daringly repulsive, and challenging their friends to top the result. In recent weeks, a new version of NekNominate has started to make the rounds, this one inviting people to do an act of good will. It has gone under many headers; some folks have reappropriated NekNominate, others call it RAKNominate (for Random Acts of Kindness). The charity-driven trend originated in South Africa, where a handful of people horrified by the drinking game decided to give it a new slant. One of those who started the trend was Brent Lindeque, a brand activation specialist who was NekNominated by a friend. Rather than getting drunk, he decided to use his nomination to feed a homeless person. ""I'd only viewed two [NekNominate] videos. One was of a gentleman from England urinating into a cup. He added beer and drank it all down. The second was of an aggressive man who bit the head off a chicken -- a baby chicken -- and swallowed it before he drank his beer. I couldn't understand why people were putting something so ridiculous online,"" he recalls. ""When I was NekNominated, I wanted to do something different that could be filtered into my circle of friends. If I fed one person, hopefully the people I NekNominated would do the same,"" he adds. He didn't imagine the video would get much traction beyond his circle. He was wrong. Since posting it on YouTube last month, Lindeque's video has garnered over 755,000 views. He has also attracted an additional 7,000 Twitter followers. He has since used the video as a launchpad for a social media campaign (#changeonething), a weekly radio segment and, perhaps soon, a charity foundation. ""The foundation will hopefully go live in March. It's kind of a dating site for charities, where they can have a profile and list their needs on a micro level,"" he explains. So far, thousands have been inspired by his video (he estimates that he has already received over 100,000 emails from people who have continued what he started). Big brands, including Nandos and South African Breweries, have also followed suit. ""One beautiful story I was sent was from a man in England who went into a grocery store and bought a bunch of food. He saw a homeless man and gave him the food, then asked him to hold the camera while he took off a jacket his father had given to him and gave it to the man,"" he recalls. The movement has struck a particular chord in South Africa, where others, oblivious to Lindeque's efforts, have taken a similar stance with NekNominations. Ashton Hayes, a digital marketing strategist, decided to use the concept to help rebuild his neighbor's house after a fire incinerated the roof. ""The fire happened in December, and by January, nothing had been done. There were a few funds that had been raised, but not enough to repair the roof, which had burned. That's when the idea came to NekNominate and help her out that way,"" he recalls. He created a video profiling his neighbor, Elizabeth, who also looks after 14 orphaned children in her Cape Town home. At the end, he NekNominated all of South Africa to do their part. In two days, he'd raised the required funds -- $4,000. One of the most touching stories he heard was of a 10-year old boy who donated the money he was saving to buy a Lego set to help Elizabeth rebuild her home. Local store Builders Warehouse was also nominated to chip in, and they responded by donating the tools to get the job done. ""The reason this works so well in South Africa is because there's so much need for this sort of thing,"" Hayes speculates. ""People here are looking for ways to help out, and the answers aren't always right in front of them. This gives them an excuse, and there's also a sense of urgency about it, because they have to complete the nominations within 24 hours,"" he says.","South Africans are using the NekNominate drinking game to do good deeds .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Petrol bombs, smoke canisters and hurled bricks have injured dozens of police during weeks of violence in Northern Ireland, officials said Sunday. At least 52 officers have been wounded since pro-British protests erupted in the Northern Ireland city of Belfast last month, police said. Authorities have arrested 70 people in connection with the violence. Tensions have been high since City Council members there voted a month ago to stop flying the Union Jack flag year-round, restricting it instead to certain days. Politicians, clergy and community leaders were meeting Sunday afternoon to discuss ways of ending the unrest. The meeting came a day after the Police Service of Northern Ireland said its officers deployed water cannons and fired plastic bullets Saturday night at a crowd of more than 100 demonstrators who were hurling fireworks and bricks at them. On Friday night, more than 30 petrol bombs were thrown at officers during serious disorder in the same part of the city. Officers were also pelted with ball bearings, fireworks and masonry, police said. Another officer was hurt Friday in the Newtownabbey area, police said, where bottles and bricks were thrown at police in the course of a protest lasting several hours. Northern Ireland's political leaders have called for an end to the pro-British protests, which were prompted by the vote to limit display of the union flag of the United Kingdom. The disorder follows a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police officers hurt. The recent violence follows more than a decade during which Northern Ireland has made steady progress toward lasting peace and stability. On Sunday, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said officers were prepared for more violence. ""You may be assured there will be sufficient resources in the event of more disorder for however long is necessary,"" Chief Constable Matt Baggott said in a statement. ""The police service will continue to do everything possible to maintain law and order and we will deal firmly with outbreaks of violence."" More: Policewoman targeted as tensions rise .

"(CNN) -- ""X-Men: First Class"" hits theaters as the fifth in a series of successful movies in the ""X-Men"" franchise, with at least two more ""X"" films on the horizon: ""The Wolverine"" and ""Deadpool."" The series was the second launched by Marvel Studios in 2000, following a wildly popular 1990s Saturday morning animated series, which closely followed the story arcs from decades of stories from the wildly popular comic books. Marvel Comics regularly puts out seven core ""X-Men"" titles, and they remain among the top-selling titles for the company. This kind of success certainly was not the case in 1975, when Chris Claremont took over as writer for ""Uncanny X-Men."" At that time, it was a bi-monthly title and a perennial ""also-ran,"" not as popular as other Stan Lee creations like Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four. When then-editor-in-chief Len Wein noticed Claremont's enthusiasm for the characters, he asked Claremont to work on the title. ""For the chance to work with those characters and a talented artist like Dave Cockrum, I said yes,"" Claremont said. With the introduction of characters like Rogue, Gambit and Mystique, the development of Wolverine, and classic storylines like the ""Dark Phoenix Saga,"" readers soon discovered (and in some cases, rediscovered) the X-Men. So, what was it that got them hooked, and what has hooked so many since? ""I wanted the characters to be memorable, just out of a sense of realism,"" said Claremont, ""that the more like the readers they became, in familiarity in challenges, in the stresses and strains they faced, and choices they made to overcome them, the more enthusiastically the readers would bond to them, and stick around and come back for more."" Claremont described himself as being ""knocked off his feet"" over and over by the fans' affection for the characters. ""For many of them, the X-Men were akin to real people, the conflicts the X-Men faced had resonance in their own lives,"" he said. ""It was sort of daunting because from the inside looking out, it's 'Hey, I'm writing stories about adventures with colorful costumes, and we're all having a great time.' But it's readers bonding with people, not with images, and it became a circumstance where I, as a writer felt a responsibility to respect that relationship, and in turn come up with stories that fulfill the investment for the reader. It was not just a casual throwaway thing. If they care that much I have to give them something worth caring about."" Claremont recalled meeting one fan years ago, who was in tears. ""Her husband had been willing to indulge her affection for the comics so long as it was just her, but now their children were growing up and starting to read and he was not convinced that people having adventures in skintight costumes were altogether appropriate,"" he said. ""His feeling was that his wife would have to stop reading it, and she was heartbroken because she had an equally strong commitment to the fictional characters she had been enjoying all these years. When you come face to face with that kind of circumstance, it has to be treated with respect.  It's like singing on stage and realizing you had an impact on your audience, and using that as an excuse to do your craft better than before."" Readers like iReporter ""Cougar"" Littlefield of Broomfield, Colorado, have been touched deeply by the X-Men in the years since. ""One story that really changed me was 'The Legacy Virus,'"" he said, describing the story arc that played out over several years, ending with Colossus' sacrifice and his girlfriend Kitty Pryde's exit from the X-Men. ""It helped me let go of some serious issues in my life at the time,"" said Littlefield. ""I saw that this superhero could let go, and I realized I could let go and move forward from some things that were holding me back and really ruining my life. It was a true coming-of-age story."" The X-Men have been particularly relatable to the geek set, said Kiel Phegley, news editor of ComicBookResources.com: ""Any kid that ever felt a little strange -- be they a traditional comic nerd, a theater geek, a punker, an ethnic minority or someone who self identifies as queer -- could see themselves in the struggles of the mutant heroes fighting to fit in to the normal world. Of course, it never hurt things that such a personally powerful metaphor came wrapped in stories of ruggedly sexy superpeople who spent their time falling in and out of love with each other whenever they weren't battling giant robots."" As for Claremont, he was caught up in these characters just as much as the readers were, and stayed with the X-Men titles until the early 1990s (and returned to the characters several times since). ""I kept running into all these really neat people in the book,"" he said. ""The more stories I told, the more I found I wanted to tell. There was always something left unsaid. I got hooked by my own impulse of 'Well, what's gonna happen next?' "" The characters' relatability, trials and tribulations weren't the only things that caught fans' interest. Many saw parallels between the mutants' struggles to fight prejudice and what was happening in the real world. ""The constant theme of 'people fear what they don't understand' is what defines most of America's issues, especially with racism, homophobia and anti-Semitism,"" said iReporter and motivational speaker Omekongo Dibinga, a lifelong fan of the characters. ""Professor Xavier always talks about engaging, always talks about going to the community, and a lot of people really need to pay attention to these comic books, because I think we can learn a lot from them."" Another famous Claremont story arc, ""Days of Future Past,"" had quite an impact on readers, such as Viktor Kereny of Los Angeles, California. ""This story gave me insight into the issues of genocide and fighting for freedom,"" he said. The characters of Xavier and Magneto have even been compared to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Last year, Lee told CNN, ""They were meant to emphasize the conflict between people who felt that we've got to all work together and find a way to get along, and people who feel, 'We're not treated well, therefore we're going to strike back with force!' "" When asked about the comparisons, Claremont said, regarding his early work in the 1970s, ""It was too close. It had only been a few years since the assassinations. In a way, it seemed like that would be too raw. My resonance to Magneto and Xavier was borne more out of the Holocaust. It was coming face to face with evil, and how do you respond to it? In Magneto's case it was violence begets violence. In Xavier's it was the constant attempt to find a better way."" ""As we got distance from the '60s, the Malcolm X-Martin Luther King-Mandela resonance came into things. It just fit."" The word Claremont uses the most to explain the X-Men's appeal, as well as  comics' appeal in general, is ""primal."" ""The best moments in comics come from a primal image that captures the emotion and the conflict. What you add are the pieces that get you to the point and what happens next. Comics are primal, down and dirty."" So, with so many decades of being so close to these characters, could Claremont ever pick a favorite? ""It's like asking a dad if you have a favorite kid,"" he said. ""I could cheat and say Kitty... well, but Lockheed ... Nightcrawler is so cool. Jean is so ... and then there's Ororo and Scott. I can't pick one, they're far too much fun.""","""X-Men: First Class"" is the fifth ""X-Men"" franchise film .

"(CNN) -- A company that provides airfare information to travel agents announced plans to end its relationship with American Airlines Wednesday, the latest move in a heated dispute between the airline and companies that distribute fares. Sabre Holdings Corp. will stop offering American Airlines fares on its global distribution system in August, a month before the airline's contract is set to expire, according to Chris Kroeger, Sabre's senior vice president of marketing. The company has also lowered American's position in the system's schedule and fare displays and revoked discounts on fees the airline pays to Sabre for each booking. American Airlines has been pushing to provide customized fare information through its own system, cutting out distribution intermediaries. ""Sabre is taking actions to protect its interests and those of its customers by supporting airlines who value the transparency and efficiency of the proven system we provide,"" Sabre said in a statement. The airline fired back Wednesday afternoon. ""Sabre's actions are discriminatory and patently inconsistent with both its contractual obligations and its professed goal of ensuring full transparency for the benefit of consumers and travel agents,"" the airline said in a statement. ""In contrast, the actions only serve to protect Sabre's market position and attempt to force airlines and travel agencies to rely exclusively on its legacy systems that only lead to higher fares and fewer choices for consumers."" Sabre, one of several airfare global distribution systems, says American's plan will make it harder for consumers to comparison shop. When the airline and online travel site Expedia couldn't reach a distribution agreement, Expedia removed American Airlines fares and schedules from the site on January 1. American stopped offering its tickets on Orbitz.com in December. The American Society of Travel agents expressed concern Wednesday about American's distribution system. ""Travel distribution is not a spectator sport, and no one will be spared if an appropriate resolution is not reached that recognizes the burden that this so-called innovation in distribution will produce,"" the organization said in a statement responding to Sabre's actions. ASTA called the airline's technological change ""a solution looking for a problem to solve,"" and urged other airlines to ""think very carefully before going down a similar path."" American said the move to direct distribution would benefit travel agents and consumers. ""Our direct connection will help travel agencies help their own customers by giving them access to customized choices and delivering the best value to travelers,"" said Derek DeCross, American's vice president and general sales manager in a December 29 statement.

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania day care center is pursuing a federal civil rights lawsuit against a swim club that canceled the center's membership, the day care director and attorney told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday. Some kids from the Creative Steps Day Care Center say white members of a swim club made racial remarks. ""Specifically, the lawsuit will be based on violations of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which relates to the denial of access and use and advantages of a public accommodation,"" attorney Carolyn Wright said. ""The humiliation, embarrassment, and the scarring and suffering of the children -- that would be covered by our claim for compensatory damages."" Wright said the center -- attended by many minority children -- is also seeking ""punitive damages to punish the club for the harm that they've done to the children."" The dispute started after the Valley Swim Club, in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, revoked the swimming privileges of about 65 children from the largely minority Creative Steps day care center after one visit on June 29. Some black and Hispanic children said white club members made racist comments to them during that visit, asking why ""black children were there"" and raising concerns that ""they might steal from us."" The day care center had originally contracted to use the pool during the summer, but the club canceled the agreement and returned the day care center's $1,950 check without explanation. The club canceled contracts with two other day care centers because of safety and crowding, swim club director John Duesler said. Those two other centers have not protested the club's actions. The issue was exacerbated when Duesler told two Philadelphia television stations the children had changed ""the complexion"" and ""atmosphere"" of the club. The comment brought protesters outside the facility. Duesler later said that safety and crowding -- not racism -- prompted the cancellation. As the controversy grew and reached national news shows, the swim club asked the Creative Steps day care to return. It refused and said it would pursue a lawsuit. Creative Steps Director Alethea Wright told CNN that the club did not reach out directly to her facility to invite them back to the pool. ""My attorneys have not received any written invitation for us to come back,"" Wright said Wednesday. ""The only thing that I've heard has been third party via the media."" She said she offered to come to a resolution but she said Duesler told her following a meeting of the club's board, ""'Let the chips fall where they may.'"" Wright said the situation has adversely affected the children. ""The children are not doing well at all ... it's really coming to the surface how these children have been affected,"" she said. ""They're asking questions [like] are they too dark to go into the pool?""   Watch what children allege club members said to them » . The swim club has been subpoenaed by Pennsylvania's Human Relations Commission, which has begun a fact-finding investigation, said the wife of the club's director, Bernice Duesler. She told CNN on Tuesday night that the club ""could not handle a lawsuit."" ""We don't have the money. We're just a small club. We're volunteers,"" she said. ""I hope we can teach our children a lesson -- that you should admit errors. We should have done things differently. And if there are differences, we can overcome them."" She again denied the claims of racism and expressed hope of reaching a resolution. Watch swim club's explanation of incident » . ""I wish we had come up with better solutions.

"(CNN) -- Russia's military occupation of Ukrainian territory on the Crimean peninsula constitutes a blatant violation of the commitments that Moscow undertook in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances for Ukraine. The United States and United Kingdom, the other two signatories, now have an obligation to support Ukraine and penalize Russia. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Ukraine found itself holding the world's third largest nuclear arsenal, including some 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads that had been designed to attack the United States. Working in a trilateral dialogue with Ukrainian and Russian negotiators, American diplomats helped to broker a deal —the January 1994 Trilateral Statement — under which Ukraine agreed to transfer all of the strategic nuclear warheads to Russia for elimination and to dismantle all of the strategic delivery systems on its territory. Kiev did this on the condition that it receive security guarantees or assurances. The Budapest Memorandum, signed on December 5, 1994, by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom (the latter three being the depositary states of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, that is, the states that receive the accession documents of other countries that join the treaty) ) laid out a set of assurances for Ukraine. These included commitments to respect Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and existing borders; to refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence; and to refrain from economic coercion against Ukraine. Rubio, Cotton: Congress must act quickly to punish Putin . The memorandum bundled together a set of assurances that Ukraine already held from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Final Act, United Nations Charter and Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Ukrainian government nevertheless found it politically valuable to have these assurances in a Ukraine-specific document. Words matter, and a big question at the time arose over whether to use the term ""guarantees"" or ""assurances"" in the memorandum. The United States provides guarantees to allies, such as NATO member states; the term implies a military commitment. In the early 1990s, neither the George H. W. Bush administration nor the Clinton administration was prepared to extend a military commitment to Ukraine— and both felt that, even if they wanted to, the Senate would not produce the needed two-thirds vote for consent to ratification of such a treaty. The Budapest Memorandum thus was negotiated as a political agreement. It refers to assurances, not defined, but less than a military guarantee. U.S. negotiators —myself among them — discussed this point in detail with Ukrainian counterparts so that there would be no misunderstanding. What is taking place today in Crimea can only be described as a Russian military occupation. The Russian Black Sea Fleet and its associated units have had bases in Crimea since 1991, by agreement with Ukraine. But the agreement does not allow for the Russian military, which has poured thousands of additional troops onto the peninsula over the past several days, to take control of Crimea. Opinion: Putin's Ukranian endgame . These Russian actions are in blatant violation of the Budapest Memorandum, as well as Russia's commitments under the CSCE Final Act and a 1997 bilateral Ukraine-Russia treaty. As signatories, the United States and United Kingdom have an obligation to respond, even if they are not obligated to respond with military force. Washington and London should act in two ways. First, they should work with other European Union member states to support Ukraine. That means political engagement, such as Secretary of State John Kerry's visit today to Kiev. They should also assemble a financial package with the International Monetary Fund to extend credits to Ukraine. That can give the country some breathing room as it undertakes critical reforms to put its economic house in order. Second, Washington and London should work with the European Union and others to impose political, diplomatic and economic sanctions on Moscow unless and until Russia ceases its violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This has begun. On Sunday, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan announced they were suspending preparations to take part in the G8 summit to be hosted in June in Sochi by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Other steps have been taken, and still others are being planned. The West should aim to impose significant costs on Russia that will lead Putin to rethink his actions. That likely will prove difficult, but there can be no business as usual with Moscow. Opinion: How Putin carries out power grab . A strong response is important for settling Ukraine's current crisis. It also matters for the cause of nuclear nonproliferation. Security assurances were key to bringing Kiev to agree to get rid of its nuclear arms. If Washington and London do not stand by the Budapest Memorandum now, it would discredit the idea of such assurances. That would be unfortunate, as security assurances could play a role in defusing nuclear proliferation cases, such as Iran. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Pifer.","Steven Pifer: In Ukraine occupation, Russia reneging on 1994 deal to leave it alone .

"(CNN) -- Reality-show subject Amber Portwood, whose legal troubles began on MTV's ""Teen Mom"" show, will be in an Indiana prison for the next two years or more. Madison County, Indiana, Circuit Judge David Happe ruled Tuesday that Portwood must serve the prison time he imposed earlier this year when she pleaded guilty to a felony drug charge. She had avoided prison with a plea deal that included drug rehab, but she dropped out of the program last month. Portwood, 22, was arrested on May 24 for violating her drug court probation requirements by failing a urine test and then lying about it, Prosecuting Attorney Rodney Cummings said. Opinion: MTV's 'Teen Mom' glamorizes getting pregnant . That violation may not have caused probation to be revoked, since probationers are given two or three opportunities, ""but she just opted out,"" Cummings said. ""I just don't think she knew opting out meant five years in prison."" Portwood will likely spend two-and-a-half years in prison before being released on parole for the remainder of the five years, Cummings said. Inmates get a day reduced from their prison time for each day successfully served. It is possible she could get another 30-day reduction for completing a drug rehab program while in prison, he said. The report that Portwood definitely will be placed in a prison drug rehab program is not accurate, since that can only be decided once she is in the Indiana prison system, he said. It probably will take two weeks before the commitment order is signed by the judge and Portwood is transferred from the Madison County jail to state corrections department custody, he said. Kim Kardashian blames MTV for teen pregnancies . Portwood was first arrested on felony domestic violence charges in November 2010 because of incidents seen on her reality TV show -- where she was shown shoving, punching, slapping and choking her boyfriend, Gary Shirley. In November, HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell reported on ""Teen Mom"" star Amber Portwood's personal and legal woes. She was rearrested last December when a probation search found ""a fairly sufficient amount of several different prescription pills"" that were not prescribed to her, Cummings said. She spent more than a month in jail before reaching a plea deal on a felony drug charge that included the drug rehab program, he said. Her 3-year-old daughter is in the custody of Shirley, the father. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","A judge sends Portwood to prison for dropping out of court-ordered drug rehab .

"(CNN) -- It's a mesmerizing, surreal scene. Eight tiny, unmanned aerial vehicles -- called quadrotors -- begin to rise from the ground in unison. They hover at eye level, filling the room with a heavy buzzing sound. Then they move through a makeshift window, one at a time, and reform as a group on the other side. This isn't happening on a Spielberg set, and it isn't science fiction. These real-life flying robots are at the University of Pennsylvania's General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception Lab. ""This is a robot that's completely autonomous,"" said doctoral student Matthew Turpin, ""and by that I mean there's no remote control in the background."" The lab is a mechanical engineer's dream. Quadrotors in all shapes, sizes and colors -- and in various degrees of assembly -- cover nearly every surface. Shelves line the walls, filled to the brim with tools and toys. Most noticeable is the lab's state-of-the-art Vicon motion-capture system. Infrared cameras placed throughout a test-flying area communicate with tiny sensors on the quadrotors, feeding into a computer-based navigation system. ""We have the Vicon system, or the red lights, which allow us to figure out where the robot is,"" Turpin explained. ""Then we're able to send it commands about what we'd like it to do and group behaviors that you'll see."" Turpin gives the quadrotors simple instructions via computer, but the vehicles decide how to get from Point A to Point B on their own. The results are a dazzling display of formations, from spinning in circles in midair to navigating obstacles in sync with each other. Other quadrotors at the GRASP Lab have worked together to carry cargo and build structures. ""These robots are able to pick up these simple, almost LEGO-like bricks, and they're able to carry them from one location to another,"" Turpin said. But perhaps the quadrotors' most memorable moment was when they played instruments to perform the James Bond theme song. The video has more than 3 million views on YouTube. As much fun as Turpin and his colleagues seem to be having, he says their ultimate goal is to put quadrotors to good use outside the lab. After the 2011 earthquake in Japan, a team from the University of Pennsylvania and Tohoku University in Sendai took quadrotors into the disaster zone. Led by Vijay Kumar, a former GRASP Lab director and professor at Penn, they achieved some remarkable accomplishments. Among them: sending quadrotors -- equipped with cameras and lasers -- into an unstable building to see what sort of information they could gather. ""We went into a collapsed building; we mapped three floors,"" Kumar said. ""We got three-dimensional maps, and we were able to show that this sort of thing is feasible today."" Quadrotors could also use sensors to detect radiation levels and other biological hazards, Kumar said. That could help keep first responders out of harm's way. ""Clearly, humans will always have a role to play in emergency response for law enforcement,"" Kumar said. ""But if there's an emergency, if there's a 911 call, the question is, do you want a human dashing off to respond to it right away?"" Kumar also saw an opportunity for quadrotors to be used when law enforcement was close to apprehending a suspect in the Boston bombings. ""After the tragic incident in Boston, you saw that robot actually ripping away the canvas on top of the boat to try to look behind the cover"" for the suspect, he said, ""It's an excruciatingly, painfully slow operation. What we'd like to do is accomplish these tasks really quickly."" There are plenty of positive uses for quadrotors. But the concept of stealthy, camera-toting robots does cause concern for some people. Kumar often fields questions about misuse of the technology and privacy concerns. ""I think we should engage in a public dialogue about when to use them, what the potential benefits are, and recognize that we can protect ourselves against abuse of these devices -- as opposed to saying 'we don't want to develop this,' "" he said. For now, most of the research on these robots is still done in the lab. But you could say their potential is sky high.","At Penn lab, researchers have created small aerial robots .

"(CNN) -- The Renault Formula One team have agreed to pay damages to their former driver Nelson Piquet Jr. and his ex-world champion father after accusing the pair of lying in the controversial ""crashgate"" affair. Renault have confirmed on their official website that they were wrong to issue a press release in September 2009, in which they claimed the Piquets had lied by suggesting the team had forced Piquet Jr. to deliberately crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. At the time, Piquet Jr. stated he was ordered to crash by team bosses in order to help teammate Fernando Alonso win the race. And when the case was heard by the World Motor Sport Council, Renault were handed a two-year suspended F1 ban, enabling the pair to sue for libel in British courts. Admitting they libeled the duo, a Renault statement read: ""The team accepts -- as it did before the World Motor Sport Council -- that the allegations made by Nelson Piquet Junior were not false. ""It also accepts that Mr Piquet Junior and his father did not invent these allegations in order to blackmail the team into allowing him to drive for them for the remainder of the 2009 season. ""As a result, these serious allegations contained in our press release were wholly untrue and unfounded, and we withdraw them unequivocally. ""We would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Piquet Junior and his father for the distress and embarrassment caused as a result. ""As a mark of the sincerity of our apology and regret, we have agreed to pay them a substantial amount of damages for libel as well as their costs, and have undertaken not to repeat these allegations at any time in the future. The Piquets' lawyer, Dominic Crossley, said in a statement that Renault had apologized in court for their treatment of the pair. ""They were both treated appallingly by Renault F1 when they dared to reveal the scandal to the governing body, and Nelsinho was abused terribly throughout his absurdly short career in F1,"" Crossley said. ""It is to the immense credit of both my clients that they have refused to be deterred from righting the wrongs despite the ferocity of the attacks and the size of the opponents they have had to confront. ""Nelson Piquet dominated F1 during the early 80s and his reputation as a motorsport legend should remain untarnished by this saga.""","Renault F1 agree to pay damages to former driver Nelson Piquet Jr. and his father .

"FINNEY COUNTY, Kansas (CNN) -- U.S. communities are changing complexion as ethnic diversity grows in the American heartland. Going to church is a popular activity on Sundays in racially diverse Garden City, Kansas. Though not new in California, Arizona, Texas or Florida, the change of demographics is a bit more surprising in southwest Kansas. Finney County, Kansas, is one of six counties across the nation that became majority-minority between 2007 and 2008,  the U.S. Census Bureau recently announced. The agency defines majority-minority as a county where more than half the population is made up of a group that is not single-race, non-Hispanic white. Nearly 10 percent (309) of the nation's 3,142 counties were majority-minority as of July 1, 2008. ""Why there?"" people ask Tim Cruz, former mayor of Garden City, Kansas, the largest town in Finney County. And then, ""How do you all get along?"" ""It's just another melting pot you know,"" Cruz says. ""It makes it nice to have those different cultures. And sure they're different -- we have to understand what they celebrate and why they do it."" In the last couple of decades, massive meatpacking plants in Garden City have drawn workers from Southeast Asia and Somalia.  Watch diversity in the heartland » . You can smell the major industry of Garden City before you actually reach it and the stockyards that feed the meatpacking plants have their own unmistakable odor. After high school, Cruz worked one year in the meatpacking plant and that one year was enough for him. But he says Somalis, and many southeast Asians come to the area for the steady work, and a steady paycheck -- even if the work is tough. ""Very dangerous, long hours,"" he says. ""I am grateful that they do that work. Now, I know why my dad said stay in school, you know."" At the Alta Brown Elementary School, the native language of about half of the 409 students is something other than English. Cruz's wife of 26 years, Penny Cruz, teaches English as a second language there. In one class, she leads four kids in a card game of ""Go Fish"" to help them grasp their new language. Five-year-old Robert is from Burma and has only been in the country a few months. His grasp of English at this stage is mostly mimicry. If the teacher says, ""Robert,"" he'll smile broadly and repeat his name. Penny Cruz says the town is getting more and more diverse, adding, ""I think we all blend together and get along. There are ups and downs but for the most part I think we're all pretty accepting of whoever comes into our community and into our classrooms."" But not all of Finney County's some 41,000 residents are thrilled by the increasing cultural diversity. The day before public schools let out for the summer, teenagers of all colors were skateboarding, tossing a football, and kicking around a ball in Finney Park. Teacher Linda Turner admits while she's cooking hamburgers for the kids that she's heard some complaints about the area's newest residents. ""There were always whispers,"" she says. ""Out at Wal-Mart you hear, 'Oh, look at how they're dressed ... wonder where they're from, what they're doing here?' Especially if they weren't speaking English."" But much of the United States is looking more like Garden City. New census figures show more than one-third of the people in the United States are non-white and a staggering 47 percent of the population under the age of 5 are a minority. The latest census figures show four states as majority-minority in 2008: Hawaii (75 percent), New Mexico (58 percent), California (58 percent) and Texas (53 percent). The District of Columbia was 67 percent minority. No other state had more than a 43 percent minority population. For more than 100 years, Hispanics have lived in Finney County. Tim Cruz's grandmother moved to Garden City in 1910. He doesn't remember the name of the Mexican town she left, but does remember that she instilled a good work ethic in him as a young child. ""She was always a hard worker, "" Cruz says, ""very dedicated to her work and their church. That's what I remember about my Grandma."" He also remembers as a boy being told, ""Don't speak Spanish, you're in America, speak English."" And now, despite trying to learn on many different occasions, Tim Cruz can't speak Spanish. This Midwest enclave, home to hamburgers and hot dogs, is giving way to Vietnamese pho, or Mexican tacos. Police Chief James Hawkins admits communication with some residents can be a problem for his officers. Hawkins, a 25-year veteran of the force, has nine Hispanic officers on a staff of 58. Not enough he says, but he's trying to add more diversity. ""I have an officer who achieved citizenship about five years ago,"" the chief says. ""He came from deep down in Mexico, and said that's all he ever wanted to do is be a police officer. When he came to the United States, he learned English and has been going to school. That's what he wanted to do, become a police officer, but you have to be a citizen to do that."" For many immigrant residents, life in Kansas, even working at the meatpacking plants, is much better than where they came from. But Cruz wants the immigrants to know, in his words, that ""the American dream is much greater."" ""We catch them trying to tell their kids they don't need to go to college because this is a good life,"" Cruz says. ""We have to help educate them saying, 'No, there is even a better life than doing this and your kids can get to do that.' "" Cruz seems most pleased that his sleepy small town, is just that, and not rife with racial and ethnic tension and violence. ""I have no magic words. I would just say open arms to people that come in your community because they might be the person that's going to help you when you have times of struggle,"" Cruz says. ""We're all here for one reason, and someday we'll be gone, and you know, what kind of mark are you going to leave -- good mark, or a bad mark. There are a lot of good people, just try to be a good person.""","U.S. Census Bureau: Six U.S. counties switch to ""majority-minority""

"(CNN) -- It may be early days in the quest for energy underneath the crystal blue waters of the Mediterranean -- but the eventual bounty may be sizable for Cyprus. The Eastern Mediterranean is considered a new energy frontier with a 2010 report from the U.S. Geological Survey estimating there to be 122 trillion cubic feet of gas in the area. Nearby Israel, Lebanon and Egypt have also marked their offshore territories and are evaluating their potential. But for Cyprus, still bitterly divided between a Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north, the rewards could be more than just financial. According to the Republic of Cyprus' president Nicos Anastasiades, this rich supply of energy could help unite the island. ""The benefits out of the exploitation of the wealth of energy is going to the interest of all the people of Cyprus whether they are Greek or Turkish Cypriots,"" Anastasiades told CNN. ""What I'm saying and trying to convince our compatriots is that the wealth is belonging to the state, the residents of Cyprus. You (Turkish Cypriots) have the nationality of Cyprus as well, let's find a solution on the basis as has been agreed then you will have your proportion in participating in this wealth."" Texas based Noble Energy undertook its first drilling work in Cypriot waters last summer. French firm Total and ENI of Italy, meanwhile, will start exploration later this year. In between the ports of Limassol and Larnaca there are plans for a $10 billion facility to manage the natural gas discovered offshore. Cypriot officials say that the reserves in the one block that has been surveyed so far, when brought to market, would represent more than 100% of the country's GDP of $23 billion dollars. Early indications from Noble also hint that there are many millions of barrels of oil in their field as well. With such a potentially valuable asset, Anastasiades believes it is important to take heed of the experiences of other countries with large energy reserves and for Cyprus not to be caught out by the resource curse. ""That's why we are talking about the Norwegian model,"" he said referring to the Scandinavian nation's sovereign wealth fund that invests a large chunk of the money generated from its own underwater oil and gas fields. At the same time Anastasiades hopes to manage expectations as to the level of wealth Cypriots can expect to gain. ""We are trying to pass on to people that when we talk about energy we are talking about future generations and not for the present only."" However it is important that they ""do not have any expectations that we are going to become like the Arab Gulf Emirates and so on,"" he added. Anastasiades also recognizes that external factors have the potential impact how this lucrative new industry develops in the region. He points out that Turkey has been ""violating (Cyprus's) economic zone"" in recent years as they attempt to influence relations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. These actions may still come to impact attempts to unify the country in the future, he said, but he is confident that will ultimately not be the case. ""All of us nowadays are realizing that it's a high time to give an end to these this protracted problem. This is why I have mentioned before as an incentive the energy, the hydrocarbons and all these kinds of things."" See also: The King of hotels in Iran, Iraq and Syria .

"London, England (CNN) -- For Greek cinema, the shadow of auteur Theo Angelopoulos has cast long over the blue sky of the Cote d'Azur in Cannes. With a minimal presence abroad, Greek film has often relied on the reputable auteur for international recognition. Recently a new light has been shining for Greek cinema internationally. Earlier this year, over a decade after ""Eternity and a Day"" handed Angelopoulos a ""Palme d'Or,"" Yorgos Lanthinos has managed to get modern Greek cinematography back in the line-up at the prestigious world of Cannes Film Festival. His sophomore film, ""Dogtooth,"" won the ""Un Certain Regard"" prize in the 62nd edition of the festival and gave the 36-year-old director one of the most coveted prizes awarded to young filmmakers. Here, Lanthimos talks to The Screening Room only a few days after ""Dogtooth's"" latest win -- first prize at the Stockholm Film Festival. The Screening Room: ""Dogtooth"" is about three siblings who grow up in complete seclusion, isolated by their parents from society. How did you come up with the story? Yorgos Lanthimos: I co-wrote the script for ""Dogtooth"" with Efthimis Filippou. I wanted to write a story about the waning of the traditional family. Then, I thought of a father who wants to protect his family unit at all costs and the system he invents in order to do this. The siblings in ""Dogtooth"" are only taught what their parents choose to reveal to them about the world, and this is very little. The teens are only allowed to exercise, play with each other and watch home videos. They don't know what a telephone is and they think that airplanes only exist as toys. They are told that their most feared enemy is a cat and they are taught to bark and act obediently like dogs. TSR: Can you identify a new wave of films coming out of Greece and do these films have a singular voice? YL:No, the films that do well in Greece are very different from each other. I think one of the advantage of not having a proper film school is that Greece now has several individual films to showcase. There is not a single Greek new wave with common characteristics. For example, to mention some recent films, Panos Koutras' ""Strella,"" ""Black Field"" by Vardis Marinakis and ""Dogtooth"" are all very different from one another. TSR: How did you finance ""Dogtooth,"" and what particular production challenges did you face? YL: Funding is the biggest challenge for Greek filmmakers. ""Dogtooth"" received about $300,000 (€ 200,000) from the Greek Film Center, the state body supporting Greek film production. BOO Productions and I put in a large amount of money and a lot of our friends volunteered their time and talent to this production. Due to a lack of funds, many Greek films end up being made because people volunteer their time to filmmakers, but this is not necessarily a healthy practice for the film industry. TSR: What is the kind of reception ""Dogtooth"" has gotten so far? YL: ""El Divo"" director and the 2009 Cannes Jury President Paulo Sorrentino said that ""Dogtooth"" completely surprised him. Because most Greek films do not find international distributors, most viewers have a limited idea of what a Greek film is. Most people think of a fisherman, a beautiful island, and ancient ruins. Most of ""Dogtooth"" is shot in a big house and the surrounding garden, as the children are not allowed outside the house. In this way, the film played with the expectation viewers had when going to see a Greek film. TSR: 20th Century Fox CEO Jim Gianopoulos told The Screening Room that when a film is rooted in it's local culture, it doesn't necessarily travel as well. Do you think ""Dogtooth"" is a universal story? YL: I think it is universal. It's a commentary on mass illusion, how world leaders and the media only channel certain information to the public, isolating us from the truth. It's also a commentary on what happens to human beings functioning in a climate of oppression. TSR: Can art and commerce go hand in hand for a filmmaker? YL: It depends what films you want to make. I think art and commerce can co-exist side by side in the same film. For example, it is a big surprise to all of us that an arthouse film like ""Dogtooth"" is doing really well at the Greek box office: 25,000 admissions in Greece is considered a market success. After a six week run in two cities, ""Dogtooth"" is still screening. We have also secured several international distribution deals, including North American distribution, the Benelux countries, France and Spain. TSR: The Filmmakers of Greece (FoG), a group of filmmakers you belong to, is asking the Greek for an overhaul of its legal framework for the film industry. What does FoG hope to see in the new cinema law? YL: The FoG group would like to see tax incentives for private investment in films. It's really discouraging that, despite a law requiring private television networks to reinvest 1.5 percent of their earnings back into the local film industry, this is hardly ever executed. What's really extraordinary about FoG is that it's the first time that more than 200 film industryites have joined forces in asking for drastic and immediate change of the filmmaking environment in Greece. The current film industry cannot advance with a law that is 20 years old. Besides abstaining from the Thessaloniki Film Festival this year, a group of filmmakers that sprung out of FoG are dedicating their efforts to an independent Greek Film Academy, which will award its own prizes to the best talent in Greece.","Yorgos Lanthimos' ""Dogtooth"" won the ""Un Certain Regard"" prize in Cannes earlier this year .

"(CNN) -- Hurricane veterans know when a bad one's coming. It's like those who feel the barometric pressure drop of approaching storm systems in their bones. I got the vibe midweek. So I asked my friends on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, hardy survivors of Hurricane Katrina, what advice they would share with those in Hurricane Sandy's path. But I didn't want the usual flashlight, batteries, water, generator, gasoline tips. Tell them something they don't know, I asked, something that helped get you through. Here's what they said: . • Outdoor solar lights can be brought in at night to light the indoors. • When you make a video of your home for insurance purposes beforehand, open drawers and closets so the contents are visible. • Have a tire plug repair kit and pliers to pull out nails or screws, since debris in the roadway causes flats and leaks that are tough to repair when everything is closed. • Extend your cell phone battery's life by texting instead of calling and turning off Internet/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/GPS connections. • Bank safes and safe deposit boxes are not waterproof. During flooding, items left in them may be damaged and not accessible for weeks. • Have thick tarps and roofing tacks in case you lose shingles from the wind. What I didn't expect was the advice of a different nature that many added after their practical tips: . • Faith and the knowledge that no matter what, your life and the life of your family is more important than any material possession you may have. • Keep a positive attitude and help your neighbor! • Remember to have patience with your family, friends and neighbors. ... Work together and share your resources. • Talk to each other. Share old stories. Some of the best relationships were made in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, as neighbors discovered new friends next door and grew closer helping one another through a trying time. • Read a book. Keep a hurricane preparation checklist . These are heartfelt suggestions from those who know what it's like to lose everything all at once. Disaster has a way of focusing the mind and leveling the playing field. Doctors and bankers stood next to mechanics and janitors in food lines in my Gulf Coast hometown of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, in the weeks after Hurricane Katrina. Such brutal shocks to the system are inevitable. No one can stop them, though human beings prefer to imagine we are omnipotent. We have access to virtually anything with the click of a mouse or a tap on our smartphones. We can Skype with someone on the other side of the world. We can land a rover on Mars and find proof of ancient rivers. We can do anything -- except control Mother Nature. We don't like that, because it forces us to accept that we are vulnerable. Nations, states, cities and individuals wisely invest time and money on prevention efforts, but we can't really predict when, where and how the effects of nature at its worst will be felt. What we can control is our reaction. And researchers report that contrary to popular myth, during disasters most people don't adopt an ""every man for himself"" attitude. Most react with responsibility and concern for their neighbors. I have seen it myself, over decades covering blizzards, floods, hurricanes and more. Nearly five years after Hurricane Katrina, I was present at a remarkable discussion between the mayor of Bay St. Louis and his wife. Most of the town's homes and businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed in 2005 when the monster storm's 30-foot surge, sustained 125 mph winds and hopscotching tornadoes roared through. But the town and its people recovered. ""It was amazing. It really was,"" said Eddie Favre of the spirit of kindness, generosity and selflessness that prevailed in the months after the hurricane. ""It would be nice to reclaim some of that patience and understanding. I wish we could go back to it."" ""I feel bad saying it, but I really miss it,"" agreed his wife Jan. ""We were all so close."" Times of disaster reveal not just our human fragility, but our strengths. It is at times like this that we learn what we are made of. People come together, share what they have and accept help from others. Suddenly differences that once seemed insurmountable turn out to be quite insignificant. The worst of times can bring out the best. Hurricane safety: When the lights go out . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Koch.","Kathleen Koch: Katrina survivors share suggestions for coping with Hurricane Sandy .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actor Derek Mears has a big hockey mask to fill. Derek Mears arrives on the red carpet at the Hollywood premiere of the new ""Friday the 13th"" movie. Mears was cast as the iconic boogeyman Jason Voorhees in the new ""Friday the 13th"" movie. A remake of the original 1980 film, the new movie aims to breathe life into the former franchise about a psychopathic killer who preys on a group of young people at the fictitious Camp Crystal Lake. Mears is no stranger to the horror genre, having co-starred in ""The Hills Have Eyes II."" His career is extensive and includes stints as a stuntman in two of the popular ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. He recently spoke to CNN about taking a turn as the ultimate evil, the thrill of continuing a slasher legacy and why he's really not that bloody nice. CNN: You aren't that scary in person, so what made you think you could be that scary on camera? Derek Mears: I've got a lot of issues. I've got a whole lot of daddy issues. No, I sound like a basket case. It's funny with acting -- we all wear masks in our normal life. Not to sound like a weirdo in the hockey mask, but like right now I'm really excited about the film and excited about playing the character, and I will start to speak faster. That's kind of what's coming over me: ""Oh you're, you're really nice,"" but ... on the other side of me there are other Dereks that are angry, and like I said before, have a little bit of issues. CNN: Tell me a little bit about how you were approached. Did you know they were making it before they came to you? Was it kind of a shock? Mears: It's so weird. There's two different versions. There's my version of how it went about, and there's the producer's version. I'll tell the producer's version because my version is really, really long. The short version of my version was I heard they were doing a new ""Friday the 13th,"" and I've never tried to pursue a role before and I went, I really want to do this. So when I heard they were doing it, before I even had an audition, I started training for it. I found out a little about what they wanted for the character -- that he wasn't going to be super, you know bulky or big, that he's more functional. He's still big, but he's lean. So I started training that way and trying to do what I could just to get an audition. On the other end, on the producer's end, they asked a bunch of different industry professionals. They said, ""Hey, were doing a new 'Friday the 13th.' Who do you think would be a great new Jason?"" And my name kept popping up, which I'm blown away by. They brought me in for an audition, and I met with them. and they called me the next day and went, ""OK, you're the guy."" And I still don't believe it till this day. I'm blown away. CNN: How did you keep it light on the set? Mears: Believe it or not, all the actors ... got along so well. I have never been so close to a cast before on set. We were just goofing around and playing, but then when it's time to work and get serious with certain scenes, we'd all switch over and do our job and get to the point where we needed to. CNN: Had you seen any of the original ""Friday the 13th"" movies? Mears: Oh yeah. I mean, I'm a fan. I consider myself a fan of the series. I already knew all of the originals. I had them all on DVD, and when I first met with Platinum Dunes [the production company behind the new movie], I told them, ""Hey look, I'm a fan of the series first and foremost. If I'm right for the part, fantastic. If I'm not right for the part, that's OK, too. I, just as a fan, want to see a good 'Friday the 13th' film. I want to see the series continue so if I can help it, awesome, but I just want to see something good."" CNN: Did you try to model your character after previous Jasons, or did you try to kind of take it and make it your own? Mears: Definitely make it my own. I used the script that Mark Swift and Damian Shannon wrote as a blueprint -- like you would for any acting role where I knew the other guys who've played ""Jason"" before, and what they've done, but you kind of shove that away somewhere deep in your brain and build your character from the new script.

"(CNN) -- Russia and China have been downgraded to bottom-tier nations for their lack of efforts to fight human trafficking, a U.S. government report says. In the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, China and Russia were relegated to Tier 3, the lowest of four rankings, which names countries whose governments do not fully comply with minimum anti-trafficking standards and are not making significant efforts to do so. The classification includes countries like Iran, North Korea and Zimbabwe, and Tier 3 countries are open to sanctions from the U.S. government. In 2008, the U.S. Congress put a limit on the number of years a country could remain ranked as Tier 2 Watch without concrete signs of action. After that limit is reached, there is an automatic downgrade. China was ranked as Tier 2 Watch for eight years, and Russia was on the list for nine. Tier 2 Watch is the third-ranked grouping, which identifies governments that do not fully comply with minimum standard and are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance, but face increasing trafficking problems. Opinion: A decade of action needed to end human trafficking . Tier 1 countries fully comply with the minimum anti-trafficking standards, and Tier 2 countries do not fully comply but are making significant efforts to reach those standards. The Trafficking in Persons Report ranks nations on efforts to fight trafficking, not just the number of trafficking issues a nations faces. A Russian official criticized his country's downgrade, saying the rankings depend on ""political sympathies or antipathies of the U.S. State Department"" and alleging that the authors didn't make a deep, objective review of the reasons for a rise in human trafficking. Konstantin Dolgov, a human rights envoy with Russia's Foreign Ministry, said the United States had previously issued an ""impossible"" list of legislative and other changes that the U.S. wanted Russia to make. ""Russian authorities will never be guided by the instructions developed in another country, all the more to meet the conditions that were set almost in the form of an ultimatum,"" Dolgov said. China has not yet offered an official response to the downgrading. Justin Dillon, CEO of Made in a Free World, said: ""Speaking truthfully about the modern-day slavery situation, in countries that have diplomatic and economic importance to us in other areas, proves that we can commit on things that we all agree on. Living up to our laws and shared values is a universal responsibility."" China was named as a source, transit point and destination for trafficked people from all over the world, while its own citizens also risk being trapped in forced labor abroad. The report says state-sponsored forced labor also takes place in re-education camps. Criminal gangs ship Chinese women and girls abroad, the report says. It also says Chinese women and girls can be trafficked domestically for sex; and others are imported into the country from neighboring countries. It adds that ""despite modest signs of interest in anti-trafficking reforms, the Chinese government did not demonstrate significant efforts to comprehensively prohibit and punish all forms of trafficking and to prosecute traffickers. ""The government continued to perpetuate human trafficking in at least 320 state-run institutions, while helping victims of human trafficking in only seven. The government also did not report providing comprehensive victim protection services to domestic or foreign, male or female victims of trafficking."" It recommends that China improve its anti-trafficking laws and its record for prosecuting traffickers, including government officials who allegedly help traffickers. The report also says China's efforts to help the victims was inadequate, with only seven centers for trafficking victims. Russia was also identified by the Trafficking in Persons Report as a source, transit point and destination country for trafficked people. But the report says Russia's biggest problem is labor trafficking, with an estimated 1 million people working in exploitative conditions. It adds that prosecutions are low, compared with estimates of the problem. Russia's efforts amounted to publishing a brochure and establishing a committee that has not yet met, the report says. It also criticizes Russia's efforts to prevent trafficking and prosecute traffickers. It recommends that Russia develop national procedures for law enforcement and other officials so they can identify and act on trafficking suspicions.

"(CNN) -- Every few years, the National Science Foundation releases its new Science and Engineering Indicators, which feature a barrage of seemingly embarrassing statistics that detail just how much Americans don't know about science. The latest such report, out Friday, has caused a stir by revealing that just 74% of Americans know the Earth revolves around the sun. On the surface this figure may seem troubling, but we can take (some) heart: Aside from serving as instant fodder for the news media, quizzing the public tells us little about the state of science literacy in the United States. Science literacy isn't remembering a bunch of facts. It's an appreciation and understanding of the scientific process and the ability to think critically. A lot of smart people get scientific facts wrong, and it doesn't mean they are uneducated. In the 1987 documentary ""A Private Universe,"" Harvard students, faculty and alumni were asked what causes the four seasons. Nearly everyone interviewed incorrectly explained that seasons change when the Earth gets closer or farther from the sun in orbit rather than because of the tilt of its axis. It's also important to remember that in polling, the way a question is phrased can influence the outcome. For example, the National Science Foundation's Indicators report found that fewer than half of Americans agree with the statement, ""Human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals."" However, a 2009 Pew poll reported that six in 10 Americans agree that ""humans and other living things have evolved over time due to natural processes."" The same year, a Harris Poll reported that while just 29% of Americans agree that ""human beings evolved from earlier species,"" 53% of the same pool of respondents ""believe Charles Darwin's theory which states that plants, animals and human beings have evolved over time."" In other words, language matters. Still, one can't simply dismiss the Indicators data, in light of the very real problem the country faces: The state of science literacy has been in steep decline for a half-century. After World War II, the United States celebrated scientists for developing crucial wartime technologies from radar to the hydrogen bomb. By 1957, the Soviet launch of Sputnik sparked tremendous growth in scientific funding for research and development. Back then, scientists were heroes and worked closely with Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. Then things changed. The space race faded to memory, and nonmilitary science funding dipped. Science lost its prominence in policy, and today it's treated as a special-interest group rather than central to the policymaking process. The emergence of the religious right beginning in the late 1970s created unnecessary battles pitting religion again ""reason,"" as if we must choose a side. More recently, budgetary constraints and the transforming media environment led to major cuts in science reporting. These days, most ""science stories"" that make the news are focused on diet and fitness instead of the latest research that will affect our lives and communities. Meanwhile, the Internet allows us to shop for whatever scientific opinion we want as easily as we shop for holiday gifts. The result is a tsunami of dangerous misinformation and pseudoscience online fueling the rise of such things as the anti-vaccination movement and climate change denial. We need to shift course. It doesn't matter whether every American can correctly answer a pop quiz about science topics he or she had to memorize in grade school. Isn't that what turns a lot of us off to science to begin with? What's important is that we work to foster a more engaged American public that will not only support but also prioritize the research and development necessary to meet the 21st century's greatest challenges, from drought to disease pandemics. One way? Enlist today's young scientists entering the workforce as science emissaries -- training them with interdisciplinary skills that can be applied beyond academia. The number of traditional tenure-track jobs for science Ph.D.s is shrinking, even as we have a critical need for scientific expertise beyond the ivory towers. ""Renaissance scientists"" who pursue policymaking jobs, work as writers or even just speak another language will be best equipped to bridge the gap between science and society, serving as translators and communicators. We need this new generation of scientific heroes to restore science to its rightful place in America. Only then will we cultivate a culture of science literacy.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama has accepted the resignation of Louis Caldera, the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the controversial low-altitude flyover of New York by a 747 plane used as Air Force One, the White House said Friday. The 747 used as Air Force One flies over the Statue of Liberty in this photo released by the White House. The photo shoot, which President Obama said he was ""furious"" with, happened on April 27. The image of a low-flying plane accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet sent some New Yorkers into the streets and into a panic -- reminding them of the tragic 9/11 attacks on the city. Building evacuations also took place across the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey. Read more of Obama's reaction . Caldera later apologized for the flyover. ""I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office,"" Caldera said in a letter to Obama. ""Moreover, it has become a distraction to the important work you are doing as president. After much reflection, I believe it is incumbent on me to tender my resignation and step down as director of the White House Military Office."" The White House also released a photo of the flyover and a report on the incident on Friday. In the report, the White House said Caldera, who had been traveling with President Obama when the flyover plans were initially discussed, did not remember a conversation in which his deputy, George Mulligan, informed him of the flyover. Caldera did not open an e-mail about final plans for the flyover until after it had happened, the report said, noting Caldera had been suffering from severe muscle spasms and had left the office early on several days. Although recommendations by several parties involved in the flyover had been made that White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina be informed of the plans, the report said, that job was left to Caldera, who did not pass the information along. The flyover, officials said, was a training mission -- it was also a government-sanctioned photo shoot. Military officials estimate the mission and the photo shoot, aimed at updating file photos of Air Force One -- cost $328,835 in taxpayer money. But they said ""the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission.""

""I'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I wasn't told,"" he said, adding that the decision by the White House Military Office and Federal Aviation Administration to withhold details about the flight were ""ridiculous"" and ""poor judgment."" But according to Air Force Capt. Anna Carpenter, local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been notified of the exercise.

"(CNN) -- Sure you can wear T-shirts and shorts almost anywhere you go in St. Augustine, Florida. You wouldn't be in the Sunshine State if you couldn't. But it would be a serious mistake to write this small Atlantic Coast city off as just another sandy tourist trap. Yes, the beaches are beautiful. Yes, there are kitschy bars and a requisite gator farm in the area. But this remarkable city -- the oldest, continuously populated European-settled city in the continental United States -- boasts a fascinating military history, an abundance of ornate Spanish architecture and a European-style historical district that is best accessed by foot or bicycle. Start with a stroll down Aviles Street, a picturesque brick lane deemed the oldest street in the oldest city. 50 United States, 50 amazing spots . It's so narrow that locals often refer to the RVs that tourists sometimes try to squeeze through as ""balcony killers."" Palm trees peek their top-heavy heads out from behind European-style buildings housing art galleries, curio shops and cafes with cheerful outdoor seating. ""Best ambiance in the city is anywhere on that street,"" says local historian and unofficial St. Augustine guide Roger Smith. Make sure to duck into the many small gardens tucked into courtyards and alcoves along the downtown streets. These beautiful shady respites -- often featuring moss-covered statuary and a bench or two -- are every bit as lovely as something you'd discover in New Orleans or Charleston, and they offer a moment of shelter from the Florida heat. Next, check out the Gonzalez-Alvarez House on St. Francis Street. It is a well-restored double-level home with two coquina fireplaces and a second-level porch. The oldest surviving Spanish Colonial home in the state, this residence has been occupied since the 1600s, and offers tourists a glimpse at how people survived in the sweltering tropical heat and of what possessions families valued most, including a crude water purification system that stands outside one of the exterior doors. Witness the rich legacy . Not only is St. Augustine steeped in history, it's a city that is actively discovering itself every day. Nowhere is this more evident than in the ongoing excavations at Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park. As you walk paths lined with Spanish moss-laden oaks and tall, proud palm trees, you can imagine what famed explorer Ponce de Leon felt as he came ashore here in 1513 in search of his legendary Fountain of Youth. Spanish General Pedro MenÃ©ndez de AvilÃ©s followed Ponce de Leon's path and founded the colony of St. Augustine in 1565 on this site where an ancient Native American (Timucua) village stood. Today, visitors can watch archaeologists unearth artifacts, tour a detailed replica of the first Franciscan friars' Mission de Nombre de Dios and see a live 16th-century weapons display, including a daily cannon firing. St. Augustine spent nearly 200 years under Spanish rule and served as an important defender of Spain's trade routes along the Atlantic. One of the most impressive historical legacies of this military history is the grand Castillo de San Marcos, a masonry fort built starting in 1672 following a vicious attack by the pirate Robert Searle which left dozens dead and many St. Augustine homes, buildings and churches ransacked. The highly fortified military installation also once housed the mighty Native American leader Osceola. Today, visitors can wander the fortress or catch a historical re-enactment of a colony battle. The fort itself is built out of coquina, a type of rock found on nearby Anastasia Island that is formed from seashells and tiny mollusks, whose secretions form limestone. The material absorbs shock so well that cannonballs lobbed at the fort tended to bounce off the thick walls or stick in them, according to historian Smith. Look in on an opulent era . St. Augustine's glitzy phase was ushered in in the 1880s when oil tycoon Henry Flagler, seeking a warmer climate for his ailing wife, was charmed by this curious beach town. Flagler decided to turn St. Augustine into a destination for the wealthy and famous. Among other things, he built the opulent Ponce de Leon Hotel, a stunning example of Spanish Renaissance architecture and one of the first buildings in the nation to have electricity. The hotel's luxurious ballroom is ringed by Tiffany stained glass windows, carved wooden columns and murals painted by artist George W. Maynard. ""[Flagler] really spearheaded the idea of hotels for wealthy people from the north to spend the winter down here,"" says Susan Richbourg Parker, director of St. Augustine's Historical Society. ""It was the Gilded Age and there was a lot of wealth. It was important for the wealthy to see and be seen and they could do that at Flagler's hotel."" Today, the Ponce de Leon is restored to its authentic origins, but it no longer operates as a hotel. Instead, the grand building serves as the centerpiece of Flagler College, and houses a women's residence hall, dining facility and security office. Public tours of the college are available from May to December and cost $10 per adult. Explore the outdoors . Spending some time on the picturesque beaches ought to be a high priority on any trip to St. Augustine, and the best place to start is with a visit to the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum. This magnificent maritime marvel is a daunting 219 steps to the top, but the payoff is a breathtaking panorama of St. Augustine and the Florida coastline. General Admission for adults is $9.75; kids taller than 44 inches are admitted for $7.75. Be sure to browse the many specialty tours (at additional cost) this facility offers, including a romantic sunset/moonrise tour. For some good toes-in-the-ocean fun, head to the pristine Anastasia State Park where you can find miles of unspoiled beaches, biking paths, tidal pools and campground facilities. Wade in the warm waters and watch local bird species like laughing gulls and least terns skim the sands. And there's plenty of fun for the kids, too. Don't miss the St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park, where you can ride a zip line high in the air over the gators. (Adult tickets $22.95; $11.95 for kids ages 3 to 11). Or head to the St. Augustine Pirate and Treasure Museum, which houses a well-maintained collection of authentic pirate artifacts. (Adult tickets are $13.99, youths, $6.99). Stay and eat . If you thought all St. Augustine served up were beautiful beaches and some cool history, you haven't tasted the homemade biscuits and peach butter at the Yard Bird Cafe on King Street in the downtown historic district. ""Most tourists don't find [Yard Bird], but they should,"" says Allie Olsen, founder of the blog Simply St. Augustine. Sit in the restaurant's charming outdoor area and load up on the blue crab quiche or the chicken biscuits. For a great cup of joe, hit up The Kookaburra, a self-described Aussie-American espresso bar featuring coffee drinks, hot chocolates, juices and a strong selection of Aussie pies (meat, veggie or brekkie). For such a diminutive city -- there are only around 13,000 year-round residents -- this sandy enclave has an impressive array of good eats and swanky nightclubs to keep you well fed and hydrated. ""It's a small town with big-city perks,"" says blogger Olsen. ""And I get to wear my flip-flops year round."" Stave off afternoon hunger pangs with a trip to Crave, a food truck situated right on the water in downtown St. Augustine. This food truck serving healthy sandwiches, salads and wraps is only open for lunch, and, with any luck you'll get there just in time to snag a picnic bench with an ocean view. For great seafood, try Catch 27, a Southern-style restaurant where the traditional shrimp and grits won't disappoint. For unusual libations in a vintage 1920s loft space, sidle up to the bar at Ice Plant. And locals swear the best place to listen to terrific tunes and get busy on the dance floor is the Tradewinds Lounge. ""It looks divey from the front, but the house band is amazing,"" says local historian Smith. ""The former lead guitarist with Santana plays here from time-to-time. Jimmy Buffett will come in occasionally ... rumor has it, when Buffett was coming up in the ranks, he got booed here. So he'll come in, but he never plays,"" says Smith. At the end of a long evening, check into the Bayfront Marin House bed and breakfast in the downtown area. This charming waterfront inn is brimming with elegance and stunning views, and, in the balmiest months, serves complimentary homemade ice cream and margaritas. This B&B also offers free parking and complimentary bicycles to those guests who'd prefer to ditch the car for an easier way to get around the city. Rates start at $229 for ocean view suites and $179 for smaller rooms.","The town of St. Augustine, Florida, dates back to 1565 .

"(CNN) -- First, Brandeis University offered an honorary degree to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an outspoken critic of Islam. Then apparently when officials actually familiarized themselves with her writing after several complaints, they took the offer back this week. One Fox News contributor calls it ""an honor killing, Brandeis-style."" That's crass, but the university's behavior is certainly disappointing. It smacks of cowardice, and Hirsi Ali can't be blamed for seeing it as an attack on her personal dignity. An act that was meant to honor her has been turned into an opportunity to shame her -- and, as she pointed out, ""The slur on my reputation is not the worst aspect of this episode. More deplorable is that an institution set up on the basis of religious freedom should today so deeply betray its own founding principles."" Indeed, the fear of creating offense is not compatible with academic freedom. On the contrary, criticizing society in the boldest terms possible is what intellectuals are there to do. So Brandeis ought to have stood by its invitation. But there are some who would ask why it made the invitation in the first place. If the institution was worried about generating controversy, all it had to do was Google her name to discover that Hirsi Ali is a very controversial person. Indeed, her views fall well outside of the mainstream. Hirsi Ali's story is undeniably moving. Born in Somalia, she was the victim of female genital mutilation at the age of 5 and was betrothed into an arranged marriage, which she escaped by seeking political asylum in the Netherlands. Thereafter she emerged as a forceful, politically engaged critic of Islam -- her memoir, ""Infidel,"" is an extraordinary testament to the horrors that fundamentalism can wrought on an individual. Her ethnicity excuses her from the charge of racism; her politics is not reactionary but rather a very muscular variety of liberal universalism. However, the Islam that Hirsi Ali knew and denounces is a narrow cultural experience -- not the reality of the religion as a whole. There is no female genital mutilation in the Koran; tribes do it because it is a custom, not a legitimate religious instruction. Likewise, the extreme Islamism that threatens the West -- and against which the right campaigns -- is a small, geographically limited phenomenon that is almost unrelated to the considerably more liberal forms of Islam practiced in, say, Bangladesh or Europe. It is true that Taliban Afghanistan or Iran have been theocratic, but this doesn't make Islam incompatible with democracy. Far from it: Muslim political protest has been the heart and soul of the Arab Spring. And Hirsi Ali's insistence that ""violence is inherent in Islam"" is absurd. Violence is inherent in all of humanity -- you only have to read the Judeo-Christian Old Testament to find that out. And if violence was a purely Muslim thing, wouldn't we expect Muslims universally to hold fascistic views? On the contrary, evidence suggests that globally they lean toward democracy, pluralism and a qualified gender equality. Moreover, Hirsi Ali's personal experience of life growing up in war-torn Africa is a million miles away from that lived among second- or third-generation Muslim immigrants in Europe. There the picture is one of integration, spoiled only by a handful of radicals who were tolerated by both the state and the Islamic community for far too long. British journalist Fraser Nelson recently wrote a widely read piece pointing out that newspaper headlines about Islamic fundamentalism give a distorted view of religious relations in the United Kingdom. He noted, ""Last year ... the Jews of Bradford were facing the closure of their synagogue. Its roof was leaking, and the few dozen remaining regulars could not afford the repairs ... As things turned out, the synagogue was saved after a fundraising campaign led by a local mosque. Zulfi Karim, the secretary of Bradford's Council of Mosques, now refers to (synagogue chairman Rudi) Leavor -- who fled the Nazis -- as his 'newfound brother.' "" When I wrote a piece in the same newspaper arguing that Islam was very close to Britishness in its obsession with good manners, hospitality and charity, I received dozens of abusive missives from white supremacists. It was a reminder that the flipside of Islamism is anti-Muslim hate. Which, I'm afraid to say, is given propaganda material by the well-dressed, middle-class intellectuals who appear so frequently on our televisions to pronounce that ""violence is inherent in Islam."" All of which doesn't mean that Hirsi Ali should be driven from the public sphere. On the contrary, her story is a testament to the evil that does exist in the world, and Brandeis should have stood by its decision to honor her. The right to speak freely should never be tampered with. But in the conversation about the limits to this speech that has followed, let this one fact be remembered: Hirsi Ali's views are deemed politically incorrect for good reason.","Timothy Stanley: Brandeis withdrew honorary degree offer to Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali .

"(CNN) -- Japan's re-emergence into global motorsport has gathered pace after Suzuki confirmed it will return to elite motorbike racing in 2015. Suzuki withdrew from MotoGP at the end of the 2011 season, blaming the global recession for its decision to leave the sport, but has had a rethink to partly help develop its range of bikes. ""Suzuki Motor Corporation has organized its test team to undergo more practical running tests at its advanced development stage and will participate in the official joint testing to be held at the Catalunya circuit in Spain,"" said a Suzuki statement. ""Through continuing running tests at the circuits inside and outside Japan for further development and refinement, Suzuki will participate again in MotoGP racing from 2015.

Japan's Nobuatsu Aoki and current Aspar Racing team rider Randy de Puniet were in the saddle as Suzuki made its return to the track during Monday's official test event at the Circuit de Catalunya. ""I am satisfied because the first test at Motegi was quite good and now we are at a GP track, with most of the other riders and running in the same conditions,"" France's De Puniet told the sport's official website after Monday's first run. ""I think we did a great job because I'm only seven tenths slower than the best lap time today and after only 50 or 60 laps; all of the other riders have already been here for three days. I am satisfied, but think we could be even faster if we had one more day.

"(CNN) -- ""Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house -- too much of you, and they will hate you."" For the rival English cities of Liverpool and Manchester, familiarity, and proximity, as that quote from the King James Bible suggests, has indeed bred contempt. Where these two cities are concerned, there is a history of ill feeling. It is a rivalry that has been most bitterly played out on the football pitch between Liverpool and Manchester United but where bragging rights are up for grabs in even music and culture. English football faces litmus test of civility . Over the years as the two sides met at Liverpool's Anfield stadium or at United's ground at Old Trafford, hostilities festered and grew. Cruel songs were sung about tragedies -- the Munich air disaster that affected United and the Hillsborough tragedy that has cast a pall over Merseyside -- supporters were mocked and players taunted. The ugly sideshow to inter-city sporting endeavour reached a crescendo last season over a dispute over racism and this Sunday the fires will be stoked once again when the two teams meet at Anfield. ""It's one of the biggest rivalries in world sport, and those rivalries -- whether it's Barcelona vs. Real Madrid or whoever -- thrive upon an element of spite,"" explains author, and Liverpool native, Kevin Sampson. Down the rabbit hole: Depression in the Premier League . ""There's no doubt, though, that the Liverpool vs. Manchester United rivalry has deteriorated into hatred."" In almost every regard, there are alarming similarities between the two areas. Both have a proud industrial history, have made significant contributions to popular culture and are widely viewed as modern, forward-thinking cities. ""This is the ultimate irony,"" said Sampson. ""With their proud working-class traditions, their enormous contributions to music, art, pop culture, sport and, above all, their global footballing legend, Liverpool and Manchester have set down a lasting international legacy. ""They have much more in common than either cares to admit. Perhaps that's why the rivalry will endure."" Blog: Whatever happened to Rafael Benitez? But this particular feud is about more than The Beatles vs. Oasis or The Hacienda vs. The Cavern Club. ""It goes back to the Industrial Revolution,"" explains Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) chairman Gerard Shamash, referring to the construction of what was then the world's largest ship canal in 1887. ""Mancunians regard themselves as somewhat superior to Liverpool, perhaps unjustifiably but that's the way we are,"" added Shamash. Back on the football pitch, there has been only one winner in recent years. Scottish manager Sir Alex Ferguson arrived at United in 1986 with the expressed aim of knocking Liverpool, the undisputed force in English football at the time, ""off their f***ing perch."" A quarter of a century later, Ferguson had clambered atop that perch as United won their 19th English title, overhauling Liverpool's record of 18. Meanwhile Liverpool's quest for a 19th championship -- the Reds last won the league title 1991 -- has been the downfall of a number of managers, including club legend Kenny Dalglish and European Champions League winner Rafael Benitez. The consolation for Liverpool has come in the European Cup, now known as the Champions League, with the Anfield trophy cabinet showcasing European club football's top prize on five occasions, compared to three wins for United. ""Both clubs believe they are the 'biggest' in the world,"" continues Sampson. ""United in terms of fanbase and revenue, Liverpool in terms of their folklore and success."" But in recent months, the rivalry between the two has raised questions over whether such tribalism is out of place in the 21st century. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was handed an eight-match ban for racially abusing United defender Patrice Evra during a game between the teams in October 2011. The issue dragged the two sets of fans even further apart, with each group launching a staunch defence of their player. When the two teams met again in February this year, the prematch handshake overshadowed the on-pitch action. Uruguay's Suarez refused to accept the hand of the Frenchman he was adjudged to have racially abused. ""If Evra plays -- and his poor form suggests he may not -- he will endure a hostile reception no doubt about it,"" said Sampson ahead of the meeting at Liverpool's Anfield stadium. ""But the atmosphere at these matches is always intense."" In the moments before kick-off on Sunday, ahead of the 186th meeting between the two teams, Evra and Suarez will have an opportunity to set the mood -- and an example -- to the two sets of spectators. ""There is talk suggesting Evra will shake Suarez's hand and vice versa,"" said Shamash. ""I think it is time to move on. It would set the right tone. ""I sincerely hope they both bury the hatchet and there will be a handshake."" If ever there was a time for an air of reverence between the two clubs, it is now. Last week saw the release of an independent report into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, a tragedy which saw 96 Liverpool lose their lives at an FA Cup semifinal in 1989. The report absolved fans of any blame for the fatal crush, instead pointing to the authorities who failed to take the necessary preventative actions. The chant ""always the victims, never your fault"" has been directed at Liverpool supporters by a small minority of United fans in recent times, but MUST outlined their opposition and strong disapproval for any anti-Hillsborough slurs. ""Nothing surprises me when it comes to football rivalries ... accepted norms are abandoned for 90 minutes,"" added Sampson. ""Fans will fling anything at each other, so long as it lets them know how much they despise one another. ""In an ideal world Liverpool and Manchester United, as two clubs whose fanbases have known football's tragic lows along with indelible highs, would set a better standard."" Coping with loss is something else which binds these two football institutions. United's darkest hour arrived on a Munich air field in February 1958. Matt Busby's vibrant young team, hailed as ""The Busby Babes"", were stopping off in Germany following a European Cup tie in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. In snowy, slippery conditions, the plane crashed, killing 23 people and eight of the United team. Among the fatalities was Duncan Edwards, a 21-year-old midfielder tipped for superstardom who died in hospital 15 days after the crash. As with the Hillsborough disaster, a small minority of Liverpool fans have used the crash as a stick with which to beat United's supporters. ""MUST will not have the slightest truck with anyone who suggests what happened at Hillsborough wasn't a complete and utter failure of the state,"" insisted Shamash. ""I can remember seeing all of the coffins coming home from Germany after the Munich air disaster, the number of people killed in that was substantial and it wasn't as many as were killed at Hillsborough. ""I've always felt what happened at Hillsborough was absolutely monstrous ... You would have thought there would be some sort of cross sympathy between supporters, but sometimes people do things before thinking."" Liverpool fans had been wrongfully blamed for the tragedy for over two decades, with police statements amended to remove any criticism of the authorities. When asked about his reaction to the report, Sampson replied: ""Relief that the truth is out there at last, delight that the families most affected by the tragedy can take steps towards a kind of peace with themselves. ""But there's also anger that, as a people and a club, we were unfairly tarred for so long. It may take time for that to heal."" The healing process could be aided this weekend by a gesture of goodwill and support from the United fans in the away end towards their Liverpool counterparts gathered in the fabled Kop. United season ticket holder and journalist Paul Vallely suggests, in the ultimate show of sympathy, the club's fans could sing Liverpool's famous anthem ""You'll Never Walk Alone"". ""United's manager Sir Alex Ferguson had called for an end to the hostility between his club and Liverpool,"" Vallely wrote in an article for The Church Times. ""He was not heeded by some. Perhaps he should remind his fans that when eight Manchester United players died in the Munich air crash in 1958, Liverpool offered United five players so the Manchester club could finish the season. ""Ahead of the match between Liverpool and Man Utd on Sunday he needs to make a gesture of considerable magnitude. And on the day the United fans should know what to sing.""","Liverpool and Manchester United will meet in the English Premier League on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its unanimous ruling in two cases testing the authority of police to conduct a warrantless search of an arrested person's cell phone, holding that police generally must obtain a warrant before searching the cell phone of someone they arrest. For the most part, the justices' rulings in cases dealing with the Fourth Amendment go largely unnoticed by the public, but the court has reminded us in this opinion that modern technology is subject to the same original privacy rights that flow from the Constitution. Most citizens are not interested in these cases the way they are in issues like same-sex marriage or gun control. On the whole, Americans don't worry too much about search-and-seizure issues because they think these cases don't apply to them. ""Those cases only apply to criminals."" ""I'm not planning on getting arrested."" ""I have nothing to hide."" The sentiment is understandable. Most of these cases involve application of the ""exclusionary rule"" to throw out evidence like guns or drugs, based on the way it was seized. But this does not mean that only criminal defendants have an interest here. The rest of us should pay attention for two reasons. First, most people don't realize how easy it is for the police to arrest a person and seize his or her property. Second, our private information is no longer on a piece of paper in a safe. It's in the form of data, and it's on our person, or in that thing they call the ""cloud."" If police can access your cell phone without a warrant, they can access your entire life. Don't believe me? What's in your cell phone right now? Is there anything you wouldn't want a stranger swiping through? How about the apps on your phone? Do you do any banking or other transactions on there? Cell phones not only contain data -- they are now becoming a portal beyond the device itself, into a third-party world, whether that's your health information, your finances, or anything else out there in the cloud. And if you're like most people, you're not immune to arrest. Police can potentially arrest you for minor infractions like littering, jaywalking, and traffic offenses. And just because they arrest you, should they be able to swipe through your pictures and text messages? Police can search containers on your person without a warrant if they contain evidence that might be destroyed, or a potential weapon. Unless you can throw your iPhone like a ninja shuriken, it's probably not much of a weapon. The two cases decided Wednesday by the Supreme Court involved somewhat different factual situations. In Riley v. California, the case involved a stop for a traffic violation, which led to David Riley's arrest on weapons charges. An officer performed a ""search incident to arrest"" (one conducted without a warrant) and accessed information on a phone in Riley's pocket. He saw on the phone the repeated use of gang terminology. A later search at the station of the phone's digital contents led to Riley being charged in a gang shooting. The United States v. Wurie case involved an arrest after police observed Brima Wurie engage in a drug sale. As in Riley, the officers seized a cell phone and noticed on the screen that the phone was receiving multiple calls from ""my house."" The officers opened the phone, traced the ""my house"" number to an apartment, obtained a search warrant and found drugs, a firearm and other bad stuff. In deciding these two appeals, the Supreme Court ruled that the police generally may not, absent a warrant, search digital information on a mobile phone seized from an arrestee. Officers may still examine the physical aspects of a cell phone to ensure that it will not be used as a weapon -- which is a definite possibility due to modern criminal ingenuity. But the Supreme Court has now announced that absent certain urgent circumstances, the actual data on a phone is never physically dangerous. You can't throw an emoji at anyone, or stab someone with a Snapchat. Citizens enjoy more substantial privacy interests when digital data is involved, says the court. The Supreme Court ruling in the Riley case says American jurisprudence has ""recognized that the Fourth Amendment was the founding generation's response to the reviled 'general warrants' and 'writs of assistance' of the colonial era, which allowed British officers to rummage through homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal activity. Opposition to such searches was in fact one of the driving forces behind the Revolution itself.""","Supreme Court unanimously rules that cops can't search a cell phone without a warrant .
