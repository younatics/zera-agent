"(CNN) -- Police drones circling overhead, ready to help search for lost children, rescue stranded boaters and capture criminals. Or drones equipped with lethal weapons, high-tech cameras able to see through clothing, and technology that monitors a person's visit to religious or political events. Those were divergent and tricky scenarios discussed at a congressional hearing on Thursday (October 25), as lawmakers contemplated a market that experts believe could grow to 10,000 unmanned aircraft in five years. Congress has ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to develop plans to integrate them into the national airspace system used by jetliners, private and military planes, helicopters and blimps by 2015. But there are challenges with safety and operations with anticipated police, homeland security, private and commercial use. Privacy, another concern, was looked at closely at the congressional field hearing in Texas. ""We need to establish clear guidelines about when and for what purpose law enforcement agencies, private citizens, and businesses can use drones,"" said Rep. Ted Poe, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime, terrorism, and homeland security. In many respects, privacy issues involving drones are no different than those presented by other aircraft and satellites, experts said. But traditional aircraft are costly and expensive to maintain, placing natural limits on their use. The low cost of drones will ""erode that natural limit,"" allowing governments to conduct regular surveillance on people, said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. ""As the number of drones rises, so, too, will the number of suspects,"" said Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat. ""During the civil rights movement, would activists have left their homes if they knew"" they were being monitored from cameras 30,000 feet above?"" he asked. ""If we take a Laissez-faire attitude towards this, we will see an erosion of our liberties,"" Johnson said. Experts testified that Supreme Court case law regarding police aerial surveillance relies heavily on the concept of the public's ""reasonable expectation"" of privacy. But those expectations will change as drones become more commonplace, said David Leebron, president of Rice University and former Dean of Columbia Law School. ""As technology changes, if we take no action, so do our expectations,"" Leebron said. So several witnesses at the hearing said a legislative fix is needed to uphold current standards of privacy. A bill introduced by Poe would prohibit the FAA from issuing a drone permit for use by law enforcement unless it is related to a warrant for the investigation of a felony, with some exceptions. It also would prohibit individuals from conducting surveillance on private individuals or private property without the owner's consent. ""We must decide now when drones can and cannot be used in order to ensure constitutional safeguards,"" Poe said. ""Technology may change with time, but the Constitution does not."" But others cautioned against action that could stifle industry. ""I think we're at the birth of this technology,"" said David Crump, a professor at the Houston University Law Center. ""It's true that it's exploding; it's a very fast growing baby,"" he said, ""But we wouldn't want to tell Alexander Graham Bell at the birth of the telephone"" to stop development because of privacy concerns.","Police, homeland security, businesses see growing market for drones domestically .

"(CNN) -- Here's the reality of the situation: A diplomatic solution to Syria's use of chemical weapons will include ""boots on the ground."" The threat of a military solution will not. It should come as no surprise that anything other than doing nothing in Syria will be costly and threatens the deployment of soldiers to Syria to ensure compliance. But why does diplomacy seem so enticing? Let's assume Bashar al-Assad agrees to surrender his chemical stockpiles to an international body for control or destruction. What next? Minimally, there has to be a cease-fire in Syria's civil war. There can be no inspection regime until all parties involved in the fighting in Syria agree to stop fighting and to an intrusive cease-fire verification regime. Having led the initial weapons of mass destruction hunt in Iraq in 2003, I can tell you that there is no possibility that inspectors should volunteer to race into harm's way to inspect a possible chemical site without a phalanx of soldiers protecting them. Is a cease-fire likely? No side is incentivized to stop fighting. The minority Alawites are running Syria as well as for their lives. Iran has stoked this war by proxy; it has no interest in a cessation of hostilities. Hezbollah is guided and funded by Iran so it won't stop the killing. Russia has supported al-Assad and his family for decades. It is unlikely that Russia will cut off its aid, especially in light of President Vladimir Putin's lecture to America in the form of an op-ed in Thursday's New York Times. As a starting point, Syria has to declare what chemical weapons it has and where they're located before any inspectors secured by soldiers step onto Syrian soil. Al-Assad will surrender that data on his chemical stockpiles, but it may well be wrong, full of intentional inaccuracies. Every vault behind every door within every site must be verified. The amount of time to accomplish that task will be years. Let's not forget, a cease-fire must remain in place and be resilient enough to withstand the inevitable score-settling of this bloody civil war. The killing will continue. Only the bravest of the brave inspectors will agree to this mission. Will the chemical weapons, or the other possible weapons of mass destruction that inspectors discover, be destroyed in place, or will they be taken out of country for destruction or safeguarding? The answer seems quite simple -- destroy them in place. The logistics just to arrive at the point of finding the munitions are staggering. To upload arguably unstable munitions from multiple disparate locations throughout Syria and transport them along poorly maintained roads to locations within Syria to be secured or destroyed in a nonpermissive environment when hostilities are likely to flare up any time is a monumental task. Let's hope decisions about ""rendering safe"" are made by weapons experts, not suits. Finally, every party involved in Syria's civil war wants al-Assad's chemical stockpile. Chemical weapons are strategic leverage. Hezbollah and al Qaeda insurgents are already deciding how to threaten their regional enemies and each other with the use of chemicals. Diplomacy is hard. Be careful what you ask for. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.","Military analyst says people should not underestimate the demands of a diplomatic solution .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday a missile launched from a U.S. drone struck a house in Pakistan's remote tribal agency of North Waziristan, killing eight suspected militants, most of whom were loyal to the Pakistani Taliban commander, Hafiz Gul Bahadur. Bahadur has reportedly overseen multiple attacks against NATO troops in Afghanistan. While the CIA drone war against al Qaeda in Pakistan is well known and is even, on occasion, publicly acknowledged by senior Obama administration officials, the strike against Bahadur's fighters is part of a lesser-known campaign to target Pakistani militants, who are less able to pose a threat to the U.S. homeland. This represents an expansion of the drone program that was overseen by President Barack Obama's administration. In 2004 President George W. Bush authorized for the first time the covert lethal use of drones inside Pakistani territory. During his tenure, there were 45 drone strikes in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), according to data compiled by the New America Foundation. But when President Obama took office in January 2009, the program ramped up quickly, accelerating from an average of one strike every 40 days to one every four days by mid-2011. The New America Foundation maintains a database of every reported drone strike in Pakistan's tribal regions since 2004. We monitor reports about the strikes from reliable Western and Pakistani news sources, such as The New York Times, The Associated Press, CNN, Reuters, Express Tribune, Dawn, and Geo TV. All told, the 307 drone strikes launched by the United States in Pakistan between June 2004 and June 2012 have killed an estimated 1,562 to 2,377 suspected militants, according to news accounts. Pakistan to open supply routes into Afghanistan . Of those strikes, 70% have struck North Waziristan, home to factions of the Pakistani Taliban and the Haqqani Network, which has often launched operations in Kabul against civilian targets. Over a third of these strikes have reportedly targeted members of the Taliban, with at least 10 of the strikes killing senior Taliban commanders, as well as hundreds of lower-level fighters. The United States' aggressive drone campaign in Pakistan slowed considerably in 2011. There were 70 drone strikes in the tribal regions that year, down from 118 in 2010, which saw the peak number of strikes since the program began. According to our data, 6% of the fatalities resulting from drone strikes in 2011 were civilians, up 1 percentage point from the figure in 2010. Over the life of the program we estimate that the civilian casualty rate is 16%. Clearly, as the years have progressed, the drone strikes have become more precise and discriminating. In March 2011, Pakistani Maj. Gen. Ghayur Mehmood acknowledged this when he said ""the number of innocent people being killed is relatively low"" and that ""most of the targets are hard-core militants,"" the first such public acknowledgment by a senior Pakistani military officer. Similarly, President Obama made his first public comments about the covert drone program, when he told participants of a Google+ ""hangout"" on January 30, 2012, that the United States only conducts ""very precise precision strikes against al Qaeda and their affiliates, and we're very careful in terms of how it's been applied."" Even if it is the case that there are relatively few civilians killed in the strikes, the drone program is quite unpopular in Pakistan. During the summer of 2010 the New America Foundation sponsored one of the few public opinion polls ever to be conducted in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas and found that almost 90% of the respondents opposed U.S. military operations in the region. The wider Pakistani public shares this sentiment: A June 2012 Pew Research Center poll found that about three quarters of Pakistanis consider the drone campaign to be unnecessary. Opinion: Obama ramps up covert war in Yemen . Even so, the strikes may have contributed to a relative decrease in violence across Pakistan. There were 41 suicide attacks in Pakistan in 2011, down from 49 in 2010 and a record high of 87 in 2009. The 118 drone strikes carried out in 2010 coincided with an almost 50% drop in suicide attacks across Pakistan, according to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, which monitors Pakistani militant groups. (Another factor in the reduction in terrorism in Pakistan surely was the Pakistani military's own operations against the Taliban, particularly its 2009 campaigns in Swat and South Waziristan. Some 1,600 Taliban fighters were killed during ""Operation Rah-e-Rast"" in Swat while hundreds more surrendered to the government.) Evidence of the drone strikes' impact can be found in the description provided by David Rohde, the former New York Times reporter held by the Taliban Haqqani Network for months in 2009, who called the drones ""a terrifying presence"" in South Waziristan. Officials: U.S. may repay Pakistan . Key militant commanders reportedly started sleeping outside under trees to avoid being targeted, while Taliban militants regularly executed suspected ""spies"" in Waziristan accused of providing information to the United States, suggesting they feared betrayal from within. Last month, a top Taliban commander in South Waziristan halted all polio eradication efforts in the area for fear that the health workers were, in fact, U.S. spies in disguise assisting the CIA drone program. The CIA drone attacks in Pakistan have undoubtedly hindered some of the Taliban's operations, killed hundreds of their low-level fighters, and a number of their top commanders. But they have also slowed considerably since their peak in 2010, and have come under harsher scrutiny both in Pakistan and the West, rendering the program's future in the region uncertain. The CIA strikes may also be fueling terrorism. Faisal Shahzad, an American citizen of Pakistan descent trained by the Pakistan Taliban, tried to detonate a car bomb in Times Square on May 1, 2010. The plot failed, but Shahzad subsequently claimed that the drone program had fueled his anger against the United States. * . Here is a list of the Taliban leaders who have been killed in the CIA drone campaign, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation from reliable news reports : . June 18, 2004: Nek Mohammad, Taliban leader . August 13, 2008: Abdul Rehman, Taliban commander in South Waziristan . October 26, 2008: Mohammad Omar, close associate of Nek Mohammad .

"(CNN) -- In the crowded world of social media, with its virtual currency of likes and followers, some people will do anything for attention. Post a meme on Facebook. Create a parody account on Twitter. And in extreme cases, spread something shocking or offensive. In these tender days after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings, bad behavior on social media has some observers wondering: Should people be criminally liable for false or threatening information they post online? And could they be successfully prosecuted? Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance jump-started this discussion Sunday when he complained to reporters about people posting fake information on social media related to Friday's fatal shootings of 26 people, 20 of them young children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School. ""There has been misinformation from people posing as the shooter in this case, posing using other IDs, mimicking this crime and crime scene and criminal activity that took place in this community. There's been some things in somewhat of a threatening manner,"" he said. ""These issues are crimes. They will be investigated, statewide and federally,"" he added. ""Prosecution will take place when people who are perpetrating this information are identified."" Vance would not elaborate on which posts he was talking about. But a quick search of Twitter found a handful of new accounts seemingly created to piggyback on the notoriety of Adam Lanza, the alleged gunman. One was written as if from Lanza's perspective and made profane boasts about the massacre. It had almost 900 followers Monday night before being taken down. ""It's sick. It's hateful. But I don't know what they (police) can do about that,"" said Lauri Stevens, a social media strategist who works as a consultant to law enforcement agencies. Other tweets encouraged people to take violent action against members of the National Rifle Association, the gun-rights lobby. After shooting, cops take no-tolerance approach to copycat threats . In the U.S., laws governing online harassment, threats and impersonating others vary from state to state. In Connecticut, harassment can be a felony, depending on the severity of the threats, and punishable by up to five years in prison. Since the Newtown shootings, state authorities have emphasized the law applies to online communications as well as other forms. ""Anyone who harasses or threatens the victims, the victims' families or witnesses of these horrific crimes or who in any manner interferes with the ongoing state or federal investigations will be referred for state and or federal prosecution to the fullest extent permitted by law,"" said Tom Carson, a spokesman for the Connecticut U.S. Attorney's office. ""Harassment not only includes in-person contact, but also contact via the Internet, social media and telephone."" Despite the disturbing nature of some social-media messages about the shootings, several legal experts contacted by CNN questioned whether Connecticut authorities could successfully bring charges against whoever posted them. Prosecutions over social-media activity are still rare. In October a 19-year-old man was sentenced to 12 weeks in jail in the UK for posting what a judge called ""despicable"" comments on his Facebook page about a missing 5-year-old girl. And in a highly publicized cyberbullying case, a Missouri woman was convicted in 2008 after prosecutors say she created a fake MySpace profile to befriend and then abandon a 13-year-old neighbor girl, leading the girl to hang herself. Federal prosecutors charged the woman, Lori Drew, under a statute which bans unauthorized access to computers. But a judge overturned the conviction, saying that if Drew was to be found guilty of illegally accessing a computer, anyone who ever violated MySpace's terms of service would be guilty of a misdemeanor. ""We have a free-speech baseline in this country. Saying things about the Connecticut shooting 'somewhat in a threatening manner' ... is not going to be actionable for the most part,"" Ryan Calo, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Law, told CNN's Josh Levs. ""What the prosecution would have to show is that the post, or the tweet or whatever it happens to be, was done intentionally ... in order to interfere with the investigation, in order to create a public panic,"" Calo added. ""And that's a relatively high bar to show."" Stevens, the social media consultant, believes authorities would have better luck going after social media users whose behavior crosses the line ""from saying insulting things ... to making someone feel unsafe."" She cited the case of a Toronto man who was arrested last month and charged with criminal harassment after sending a woman a series of offensive Twitter messages. The woman, Stephanie Guthrie, built her case by documenting his tweets through screen capture and an unlisted Storify account. ""Unfortunately, when it comes to harassment, the onus is on the victim to collect as much information as they can,"" Guthrie told The Toronto Star. Stevens believes there would be more prosecutions of such cases if more cops were familiar enough with social platforms to investigate claims of online harassment. Police also would need cooperation from companies such as Facebook and Twitter, which typically have been reluctant to reveal users' identities, she said. ""We don't have a lot of legal precedent. So people are at a loss for what to do,"" she said. It remains to be seen whether Connecticut authorities bring charges against any social media users in relation to the Newtown case. But Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union believes they have an uphill battle. ""The police are there to protect our safety and not our feelings,"" said Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy & Technology Project. ""If his (Vance's) suggestion is that anyone who posts false information about this case on social media is subject to arrest, that would be extremely unconstitutional. ""There's a tendency (among law enforcement) to overreact to new technology. But the legal issues are the same,"" he said. ""I can understand why law enforcement would be upset about the spread of false information. But that doesn't make it criminal.""","Connecticut police: Social media users have posted fake info about Newtown shootings .

"(CNN) -- When George Ferris unveiled the first Ferris wheel at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, it was meant to rival the engineering feat of Paris' newly constructed 1,000-foot-plus Eiffel Tower. Now, more than 100 years later, New York City and Las Vegas are engaged in a contest with dueling plans to erect the world's largest Ferris wheel. Developers in Las Vegas are building ""The Las Vegas High Roller,"" a 550-foot Ferris wheel that will be the world's tallest when it opens on the Vegas Strip in 2014. Not to be bested, New York City officials gave the go ahead Wednesday to a proposal for 625-foot wheel in Staten Island, which developers hope will be completed by 2016. ""The New York Wheel will be an attraction unlike any other in New York City -- even unlike any other on the planet,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an enthusiastic advocate, said in a news release. The wheel passed one of its final hurdles before it can begin construction when the New York City Planning Commission voted unanimously Wednesday for its approval. An affirmative vote by the City Council next month is all that is needed now for construction to begin. Meanwhile, the wheel in Las Vegas is already well underway. Caesars Entertainment, the company that is building the wheel, tells CNN it will accept its first riders ""early next year."" Caesars declined to comment on the proposed New York Wheel. Rich Marin, the CEO of New York Wheel LLC, insists there's no bad blood. ""There's no competitiveness. Our markets are very different,"" he told CNN.

"(CNN) -- A major earthquake struck off Japan's northeastern coast Sunday, prompting tsunami advisories that were later canceled, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. Small tsunamis were observed along the coast, measuring between 10 and 20 centimeters, said the JMA. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, according to the Japanese news agency Kyodo. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake struck at 10:57 a.m. at the epicenter, about 130 miles east of Sendai. The earthquake was more than 20 miles deep and had a magnitude of 7.0, the USGS said. The JMA measured the magnitude of the quake at 7.1. Tsunami advisories were issued -- and then canceled --for the coastal regions of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima. The areas were among the hardest hit by this year's devastating earthquake and tsunami. Officials in Ofunato, a city in Iwate, advised residents to evacuate. The JMA, immediately after the quake, forecast the height of the tsunami could reach half a meter (about 20 inches). No immediate abnormalities were reported at nearby nuclear facilities, according to Kyodo. Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered meltdowns after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Japan. The tsunami swamped the plant and knocked out cooling systems that kept the three operating reactors from overheating, leading to the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. Tremors from Sunday's quake were felt as far away as Tokyo. ""It's just a continuing of the aftershocks of that devastating 9.0,"" said Dale Grant, a geophysicist with the USGS, referring to the March quake. ""These kinds of aftershocks are likely to occur for some time."" CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","NEW: The JMA cancels all tsunami advisories .

"(CNN) -- We've all got them: places that live large in imagination or memory, begging us to hop on a plane to uncover their delicious mysteries.

Where are you dreaming of visiting this year? Please share your picks in the comments below. 8 travel resolutions for 2013 . Mongolia . Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman set his sights on Mongolia early in life. ""Back when I was, I think, nine or ten years old I read a book about Marco Polo, how he traveled with his uncles on the ultimate business trip to the Mongol Empire at its height,"" wrote Wedeman, who recently moved to Rome after an assignment in Cairo. ""The trip lasted almost a quarter of a century, during which he grew up, mastered Mongolian, gained the confidence of the Mongol emperor, Kublai Khan, and then eventually returned home with fantastic tales of strange lands and stranger people. The story hooked me."" 12 months, 12 trips to make your friends jealous . Wedeman socked away money from his first job delivering newspapers with an eye toward a $3,000 trip to Mongolia advertised in the Sunday New York Times magazine. ""Making around $30 a month, it would have taken me more than eight years to come up with the money."" He read about Mongolia in the meantime but spent most of his teenage years in the Arab world, where he learned the language and became interested in journalism, ""for better or for worse, a busier profession in the Middle East than in Mongolia, for example."" Wedeman took courses in classical and modern Mongolian while studying for his master's degree and found it ""beastly difficult."" He still wants to visit, in the spring or summer, he said. ""Mongolian winters, when temperatures drop to −30 °C (−22 °F) are not for me, thank you very much."" He says he would hire a guide and horses and set out for the vast steppes. ""I know it's changed radically since I first latched on to the idea. For one thing it's no longer part of the communist bloc, it's no longer isolated, and its economy is growing rapidly fueled by a mining boom (which is destroying the traditional nomadic lifestyle, and severely harming the once pristine environment)."" The price today with an upscale company is reasonable, he said, ""compared to the $3,000 it was back in 1971."" ""Today the same trip is around $5000, which though a still hefty sum, is, in terms of inflation, a steal."" Jordan . CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson spent much of the past year in conflict-ridden places that many travelers avoid these days, including Syria, Libya, Egypt and Lebanon. Next year, Robertson expects to travel to Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Jordan and Mali in North Africa, where he says al Qaeda is putting down roots. So you'd think he might like to spend some time on a secluded beach somewhere. Nope. He wants to travel with his wife and two daughters (ages 17 and 21) to Jordan. ""I have yet to take my children there and it is a very special place to my wife and I as we met there in the build up to the first Gulf War,"" wrote Robertson, briefly at home in London, in an e-mail. ""The hotel we met in, which was the CNN hotel, at the time called the Philadelphia, now the Radisson, was attacked by Zarqawi suicide bombers in 2005. ""Jordan today is becoming less stable and I would like to take my children there to visit places like Petra, the Roman ruins in Amman and Jerash, the Dead Sea and Aqaba where I learned to dive. My eldest daughter's second name is Jordan after the country ... so you can see the connection runs deep."" Galapagos Islands, Ecuador . Work has taken CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley all over the world, but in her free time she's ""never been much of a traveler"" beyond a yearly pilgrimage to Sleeping Bear Bay in Michigan, which Crowley calls ""the place of my heart."" Yet a few years ago, she was in a boat off the coast of Australia with her grown children, living out a travel dream. ""I began to see massive areas of dark brown spread across the horizon of blue water. I started to cry. I never thought a dream I had since I was a teenager would come true, but there I was about to scuba dive and snorkel in an area of The Great Barrier Reef,"" wrote Crowley. ""I love water, sea life, scuba diving and snorkeling. I love the warmth of sand just before it gets so hot you need shoes. I love a place with that spiritual feel of history and mystery. I love being with my children there to share."" Crowley's got her next fantasy trip mapped out. ""Now I have a bank account with 'The Galapagos' written on it. It's not in the cards for 2013, but I'll get there. ""I want to do one of those week long boat trips with the scientists on board who tell you what you've seen, what you're about to see because I think it will ratchet up the awe factor, if that's possible."" Pantanal region, Brazil . Shasta Darlington, a CNN correspondent based in São Paulo, is determined to visit the Pantanal region of Brazil. ""This is my second time living in Brazil and it's something I failed to do the first time, so I want to make sure I get there this time,"" wrote Darlington. ""It's the largest contiguous wetland in the world and teeming with animal life. Most people think the Amazon is the place to go to see Brazilian flora and fauna, but the Pantanal region is easily just as rich in animals and they're easier to spot, especially during rainy season when rivers rise forcing animals literally onto islands."" The region is hard to reach and navigate, Darlington said, with mostly lodge-like accommodations and boats, small planes and four-wheel-drive vehicles for transportation. But the rewards are rich. ""There are an abundance of birds, monkeys, caimans, snakes, butterflies and fish out there."" South Africa . ""There are some destinations that you know as soon as you step off the plane will change you. For me, it's always been Africa,"" wrote Patrick Oppmann, CNN's correspondent in Havana. He has visited the continent three times but has yet to make it to South Africa. ""As a journalist, I have long been fascinated with how South Africa is emerging from decades of the racial divisions of the Apartheid era. ""But it's one thing to read about those years and another to actually visit Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, or to walk in District 6, the area where thousands of black residents had their neighborhoods destroyed."" And of course, the country's spectacular beauty is a big draw. ""You can hit the beach, hike Table Mountain overlooking Cape Town, take in amazing wildlife and cage dive among Great White sharks."" Oppmann wouldn't miss trying braai, the South African way of spit-roasting meat over an open fire. ""And if there was a cold glass of the excellent local wine or beer to go along with the braai, that would be just fine too."" Where are you dreaming about going in 2013?","CNN.com asked a handful of correspondents for their dream destinations for 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Kjeld Schigt certainly understands the allure of stepping away from the business world to embrace a healthier lifestyle. Until 2010, the Rotterdam-born Schigt worked as a strategic business consultant for BP International, a high-powered job that kept him ricocheting so constantly between London and Paris that he barely had time to unpack his suitcase. Then, a two-week trip to Costa Rica changed everything. Check in: World's best airport hotels . ""Finally,"" Schigt remembers about his sojourn, which he spent surfing on the country's sunny Pacific coast, ""I felt excited to get out of bed in the morning. I felt full of energy and that finally I was getting things—things I was passionate about—done."" The trip prompted Schigt to make a major paradigm shift. Within a month he'd quit his job, bought a slice of secluded beachfront property on Costa Rica's southern coast and opened the new business there that he still runs today: Kalon Surf School, which offers retreats for (among others) plenty of stressed-out business executives. For most of us, of course, the idea of dropping our business careers to pursue fitness and fun is something of a pipe dream. When our first meetings of the day start at 7 a.m. and ""after-work plans"" often involve wining and dining clients, even squeezing in an hour to hit the gym can seem impossible. Yet we all know we feel better—and work better—when we're healthy. So what's the solution? Get-fit getaway packages, which let us spend a few days rebooting and relearning healthy habits to incorporate into our busy lives. Executive Travel: Top airport lounges for business travelers . ""People are tired of sitting on the beach with a Mai Tai,"" says Kirkland Shave, program director at Mountain Trek Health, Fitness & Weight Loss Retreat. He sees more and more business travelers using their time off to do something healthy—like hiking trails in the awe-inspiring mountains of British Columbia. While part of what retreat guests love about the Mountain Trek experience is their shrinking waistlines, Shave says the restorative power of nature is equally powerful. ""A week without hearing a car,"" he says, ""can blow someone's mind."" The combination of activity and beautiful scenery seems to be the magic formula for many of today's best get-fit retreats. But all approach the ""reboot"" experience differently, whether by leading participants through downward dogs on Mexico's Riviera Maya, biking (and tasting) through California wine country, or taking group swims in the warm, clear waters of the British Virgin Islands. Some programs put an even greater focus on healthy food preparation and consumption, like the Techniques of Healthy Cooking boot camps run by the famed Culinary Institute of America. Executive Travel: Best new carry-on luggage . Miraval Resort: Tucson, Arizona . Miraval's sprawling 400-acre campus, just outside Tucson, routinely hosts execs from Fortune 500 companies such as Nike and Google. Take part in the Discover Miraval package here (for as many days/nights as you choose) and you'll see why: the healthful pursuits here range from daily yoga and meditation classes to private nutritional consultations to rock climbing up the granite crags of 7,000-foot Mount Lemmon, the highest point in the Santa Catalina Mountains. The vast menu of relaxing body treatments (reflexology, hot stone massage) and the delicious spa cuisine served at the onsite Cactus Flower restaurant certainly don't hurt, either. From $633 per night. America's 10 highest-tech hotels . Mountain Trek Health: British Columbia, Canada . If you need a firm hand to help you shed those extra pounds, a trip to Mountain Trek's lakeside resort for its ""Fitness and Weight Loss Retreat"" is just the ticket. Set between the awe-inspiring Selkirk and Purcell Ranges of British Columbia, the hiking boot camp runs from May to October and keeps you moving with a steady program of daily four- to six-mile hikes—beginning with an inescapable 6 a.m. wake-up knock on your door. After a few days of trekking through fields of wildflowers, steep wooded glades and misty riverbanks, the scenery might even distract you from the weight you're dropping: an average of four to six pounds per week for women, double that for men. From $4,000 for seven nights. Executive Travel: World's most scenic train trips . Kalon Surf School: Dominical, Costa Rica . You'll want to pack light when heading to Kalon's laid-back beachfront property, nestled between the bathtub-warm waters of the Pacific and the lush green Cordillera mountains—everything, even sunscreen, is provided for you here. Surfing's combination of challenging exercise and exhilarating immersion in nature is powerful medicine for the overworked, and surfers with all levels of experience are welcome at the camp's week-long programs. (Daily clinics where your technique is assessed by videotape allow even newbies to improve quickly.) After a punishing day in the surf, bide time in the pool until dinner, when local delicacies like just-caught tuna in tamarind sauce appear from the kitchen. From $2,980 for seven nights. Maya Tulum: Tulum, Mexico . If crystal-blue oceans, emerald-green forests and sugary beaches sound more inspiring than a sweaty yoga studio, head south to Mexico's Riviera Maya for the Mind Body Adventure Week at Maya Tulum. You'll stay in one of 45 intimate thatched-roof cabanas, located just steps away from the resort's two massive yoga halls; after waking up early to enjoy a cup of freshly pressed organic Mexican coffee, you'll get to choose from more than 10 varieties of yoga. Count on more than just sun salutations filling your day—there's plenty of time between classes to enjoy traditional Mesoamerican treatments at the onsite spa, venture out to nearby Mayan ruins or indulge in a restorative afternoon beach nap. From $2,645 for seven nights. Red Mountain Resort: St. George, Utah . You can get your fitness groove back over a long weekend at an intense ""Weekend Warrior"" three-day boot camp. Red Mountain's location, set between Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks, means your daily exercise will take place amid some of the country's most dazzling natural landscapes—surreal sunset-colored rock formations, soaring mountain peaks, black lava gardens. A strenuous itinerary of daily hikes, group fitness classes and individual exercise instruction will ensure you keep the calories burning (enough that you won't feel guilty tucking into your dinner of locally sourced elk at the Canyon Breeze restaurant). Après workout, you'll want to make time to visit the onsite spa, where desert botanicals and Utah honey are employed to ease your tired muscles. From $1,120 for four days/three nights.

"(CNN) -- A lawsuit filed by the family of Robert Champion, the Florida A&M University band member allegedly beaten to death in a hazing ritual, accuses the bus company involved in the deadly assault and the bus driver of negligence, their attorney said Monday. The suit alleges that Fabulous Coach Lines and its driver not only consented to the illegal acts of hazing by students, they knowingly participated in the planned hazing activity over several years. ""This was a culture embraced by this bus company,"" Chris Chestnut said. According to court documents, Bus C, which is was the vehicle where the incident took place and the name of a specific hazing ritual, was parked in a dark corner, separate from the other buses provided by the company. The suit also alleges that the bus and its air conditioning system were running at the time Champion was beaten and that the bus driver was standing guard at the door to prevent anyone from entering or exiting the vehicle. When Champion stepped off the bus at one point to vomit, the bus driver told him ""he would be alright as she forced him back onto the bus,"" the lawsuit claims. Despite a request for damages in excess of $15,000, Chestnut insisted the focus isn't money. It allows him to file subpoenas and take witness statements to further the investigation. ""We figure out how this happened, we figure out how to fix it, and then we stop it from happening again,"" Chestnut said. Calls to the bus company and its attorneys, Wicker, Smith, O'Hara, McCoy, and Ford, PA, for comment have not been returned. Chestnut said he hopes to begin taking depositions in the next 90 days. Champion's parents, Pamela and Robert -- who are named in the lawsuit and live outside Atlanta -- were not present at Monday's news conference in Orlando, Florida, but Chestnut said their goal is to get answers and justice for Robert. ""We're going to hold everyone responsible,"" Chestnut said. FAMU is protected under sovereign immunity, and the family must file a statutory notice of intent to sue and wait six months to file suit against the school. Chestnut said he does anticipate suing the university. Fabulous Coach Lines President Ray Land said last month that the company's employees, who were not on the bus at the time, responded quickly after learning there was an emergency -- even following the ambulance transporting Champion to the hospital, taking other band members there. ""We did transport our passengers safely from point A to point B as contracted,"" Land said. When employees were notified of an emergency on board one of the nine buses in the convoy, ""we responded just as quickly and effectively as we could."" Some band members have said Champion, 26, died after taking part in an annual rite of passage called ""Crossing Bus C."" According to the lawsuit, it's an initiation process in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle from the front door of the bus to the back while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members. Chestnut has said he's heard that the ritual may have happened before on Fabulous Coach Lines. In fact, the lawsuit filed by his clients claims that Bus C's driver ""frequently participated or allowed the 'Bus C' initiation"" and ""advised other drivers that she was part of the 'Bus C' posse."" Other drivers from the same company had ""complained of hazing rituals"" on that bus specifically. But they ""were instructed by Fabulous Coach administration to ignore it and (told) that FAMU was paying for it and could do what they want,"" according to the lawsuit. However, Land said the bus company has ""never seen this kind of behavior"" from the band. Champion collapsed in Orlando on the bus, which was carrying members of FAMU's Marching 100 after a November football game that included a halftime performance by the group. The medical examiner's office ruled his death a homicide and said Champion ""collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body."" An autopsy found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" as well as ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat,"" which is the fatty tissue directly under the skin. The death prompted the FAMU board of trustees to approve a new three-part anti-hazing plan, which includes an independent panel of experts to investigate. The board approved the policy 9-1 last week. Champion's mother has said she wants hazing to stop. ""Think twice when your kids are going off to college,"" she said. ""Look into what's going on at their college. ... Now we know."" Along with the university, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Orange County Sheriff's Office are also investigating the case. No one has been charged in Champion's death. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: Bus driver ""forced"" vomiting band member to go back on the bus, the suit alleges .

"(CNN) -- They're stunning, dynamic and dangerous, plus they can teach you a thing or two about the Earth's history. Volcanoes possess undeniable allure, doubling as living laboratories and tourist attractions. Volcanologist Rebecca Williams spends every second she can studying and relaxing near the Earth's lifeblood: lava. ""I had a real geeky fascination with volcanoes as a kid,"" says Williams, who is a member of the science faculty at the University of Hull in Yorkshire, England. Share your photos of volcanoes . Across the globe, travelers are discovering their inner geek, joining scientists like Williams in exploring the geological formations capable of producing incredible natural beauty and unparalleled destruction. Volcanoes are the earth's natural ventilation system, unpredictably capable of jettisoning steam, ash, molten rock and lava. Photos: Earth's otherworldly landscapes . Here's a list of volcanoes Williams says should be at the top of your must-visit list. Some of them are active, so be sure to check with visitor centers and local tour guides before heading out to explore. ""If (locals) say it's not safe to go someplace, don't go,"" she says. ""But do go (see volcanoes) because it is the most spectacular thing you will ever see."" Tungurahua, Andes Mountains near Baños, Ecuador . Elevation: 16,475 feet . This active volcano high in the Andes Mountains has experienced periods of intensified activity in the past few years. Williams spent a month in 2005 doing research at the volcano known as ""The Black Giant."" Tungurahua consists of three edifices formed over 100,000 years. The volcano overlooks the town of Baños, which Williams says is sometimes hit with volcanic mud flows caused by the mixture of rain and ash. During her research, a mudflow, or lahar, threatened to overflow into El Salado Baths, one of Baños' mineral-rich hot springs. The town is known as a gateway to the Amazon and for its basilica dedicated to the Virgin of the Holy water. The Nuestra Señora del Agua Santa celebration takes place in October and the town's anniversary is in mid-December. Dig in: Top sand sculpture events . Pantelleria, Sicily, Italy . Elevation: 2,742 feet . Pantelleria's only eruption in the last 3,000 years was underwater. The volcano shares its name with the island, which is known as the ""Black Pearl"" of the Mediterranean because of its remoteness, world-class wine and its crop of tasty volcanic soil enriched capers. Pantelleria is Sicily's largest offshore island and lies closer to Africa than Italy. Williams did research for her PhD here between 2006 and 2010 and says an eruption 50,000 years ago spewed ignimbrite deposits so hot that they instantly melted, forming a still visible black and dark green sheet of obsidian glass, often referred to as Green Tuff, across the island. Pantelleria is home to Grotta di Sataria, a cave with hot springs where, according to legend, Ulysses was kept for seven years by the nymph Calypso. Quiet coves offer great snorkeling and diving. Mount Etna, Sicily, Italy . Elevation: 10,922 feet . Located on Sicily's east central coast, recent studies show that Mount Etna's unpredictable activity increased significantly in the last decade. Mount Etna is Europe's highest active volcano, erupting 200 times since 1500 B.C., according to National Geographic. Check the national park website and with local guides for information on volcanic activity and excursions. The area was recently added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage sites. Williams visited when it was covered in snow during the 2006 ski season. She didn't see lava flow at its active vent, but there were active ash eruptions. ""As a tourist you can get pretty close and it puts on a pretty good show,"" she says. Mount Etna overlooks Catania, Sicily's second largest city, where visitors can soak up its history in the central Piazza Duomo and at the ruins of a Roman amphitheater. Check out the foundation of many delicious Sicilian dishes at the fish market. Kilauea, The Big Island, Hawaii . Elevation: 4,008 feet . Since 1983, Kilauea's lava has destroyed 181 homes, a community center, a visitor center, a church and a drive-in, according to the National Park Service. Williams calls it the ""Disneyland of volcanoes"" because of the near-constant lava oozing that has created almost 500 acres of new land in the last 30 years. More than 2.5 million people visit the volcano annually, which is located inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The park contains more than 150 miles of trails for walking and hiking. Biking is allowed on roads and some trails and there are campgrounds inside the park. ""I used to go before dawn and watch the sun rise over the lava flows,"" says Williams. ""It was just stunning."" The park is open 24 hours a day, so nighttime viewing of the glowing lava is also a possibility. Viewing conditions are variable, so research the best viewing spots and safety advisories online. Kilauea in Hawaiian means ""spewing"" or ""much spreading,"" and is the youngest of the Big Island's volcanoes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It is believed to be the home of Hawaiian volcano deity Pele. Eldfell, Vestmannaeyjar, Heimaey, Iceland . Elevation: 915 feet . Eldfell, Icelandic for ""mountain of fire,"" was believed extinct when it suddenly erupted in 1973, forcing the evacuation of the entire population of the island Heimaey, which is among the Westman Islands. The volcano has been inactive since the eruption. Most of the town of Vestmannaeyjar and its harbor were saved from the lava flow by using large pumps to spray seawater onto the lava, cooling it enough to stop its movement. ""That was maybe the only case that man has had any ability to successfully affect a lava flow,"" says Williams. ""It was only because they had an unlimited amount of water."" In addition to tours of Eldfell and Helgafell volcanoes, Vestmannaeyjar features a thriving fishing industry, whale watching expeditions and a museum of natural history. Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica . Elevation: 12,444 feet . Mount Erebus, the second tallest volcano in Antarctica and the most active Southerly volcano in the world, is home to an active lava lake that sends puffs of steam into sub-frigid air. ""When the lava cools and a crust forms, it (the crust) will move and then sink down again,"" says Williams. Under the cover of total darkness for four months of the year, the only way to reach its summit is by helicopter or walking in temperatures ranging from 4 to 60 degrees below zero. Definitely not the most hospitable volcano on the list, but Williams says she dreams of doing research there because it combines her two favorite things: volcanoes and Antarctica.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf failed to appear Tuesday at a court where he was due to be indicted in connection with the death of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. Musharraf didn't travel to the hearing at an anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi because intelligence services warned of credible threats against his life, said his lawyer Ahmed Raza Kasuri. Read more: Can Musharraf save U.S. from liability for drone attacks? The Pakistani capital, Islamabad, which adjoins Rawalpindi, was put on high alert Sunday after intelligence reports suggested the possibility of a high-profile attack. The court has adjourned Musharraf's case until August 20, Kasuri said. Musharraf is not expected to be charged with murder, but over his alleged failure to provide adequate security for Bhutto, Kasuri said last week. Accusations over assassination . Bhutto, Pakistan's first female prime minister, was assassinated in a gun-suicide attack in December 2007, shortly after she came back to Pakistan from self-imposed exile to take part in the 2008 general elections. Musharraf was president at the time. Read more: The story of Pervez Musharraf . Musharraf's government blamed former Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud for the assassination, saying he had paid a network of Islamist militants to carry out the killing. But Musharraf and his security forces have been accused of failing to protect Bhutto, a political rival. The former military ruler has denied having anything to do with Bhutto's killing and his lawyers say the allegations against him are politically motivated. He plans to plead not guilty to the expected charges. A troubled return . After the general elections in 2008 where his party was trounced, Musharraf stepped down as the governing coalition began taking steps to impeach him. He then went into self-imposed exile. Earlier this year, he returned to Pakistan in an attempt to revive his political career. It didn't work. Instead, he's become entangled in a thicket of court cases related to his time as the country's top leader. He has been under house arrest since April.","Musharraf fails to appear in court to face charges in Benazir Bhutto murder case .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The World Health Organization and Cambodian health officials are investigating why at least 61 children in the country have died mysteriously after suffering severe neurological and respiratory complications. Dr. Beat Richner of the Kantha Bopha Children's Hospitals, who first alerted Cambodia's health authorities about the unknown disease, said that as of Friday he knew of 64 cases in which only two children have survived. The Cambodian Ministry of Health said that 56 of the deaths were preceded by a common syndrome of fever and respiratory and neurological problems. Seventy-four cases of the disease have been identified, the ministry said. Countries surrounding Cambodia were informed of a deadly disease that killed dozens of children this week through the International Health Regulations event information system, which provides public health communications. In Hong Kong, a major air hub in the region, health officials responded by alerting doctors to be watchful for patients returning from Cambodia who have respiratory symptoms. Travelers who have been to Cambodia were told to visit their doctors if they developed respiratory symptoms. The unknown illness appears in children, according to the WHO and the Cambodian Ministry of Health. A majority of the identified cases were in children under 3, the health ministry said. ""The investigation is ongoing. We are looking at detailed information from the hospital records and analyzing each and every case. We hope to have a better picture in the coming days,"" said Dr. Ly Sovann, a deputy director at the ministry. The children who fell ill first experienced a high fever followed by respiratory problems. Some of them also had neurological symptoms that included convulsions, according to the WHO. Richner said the patients suffered from encephalitis, which is the inflammation of the brain. ""They are hospitalized,"" he said. ""They arrive in our hospital; in the last moments ... they die because their lungs are destroyed."" When asked what he thought caused the deadly illness, he said: ""I think our idea is an enterovirus or an intoxication of a drug,"" or a combination of both. Richner added that the number of cases affected by the unknown disease is low -- 34 cases in June, compared with the 75,000 sick children at Kantha Bopha's outpatient clinics and 16,000 hospitalized kids. The majority of the cases came from the southern part of the country, but there haven't been signs of clustering, according to the WHO. The young patients were brought to hospitals in the capital, Phnom Penh, and the northern tourist hub of Siem Reap -- the two biggest cities of Cambodia. The Angkor Hospital for Children in Siem Reap reported one case of the mysterious illness as of Friday, according to an e-mail received by CNN from Dr. Bill Housworth, the hospital's executive director. ""WHO supports the Ministry with the investigation and detailed analysis of each of these cases to find out the cause,"" wrote Dr. Pieter Van Maaren, a representative of WHO in Cambodia in an e-mail Friday.

"(CNN) -- Whenever a new hotel opens, guests are quick to flock there, clamoring for its shiny new rooms and state-of-the-art features. But there's something to be said for staying at a venerable older property, like these top-rated hotels that are each celebrating their centennial this year. Some of them have survived issues like war, recession, fire and lackluster management over the past 100 years, but each has persevered and truly stands the test of time. So next time you're visiting these eight cities, consider checking in at these legendary lodgings. GROVE PARK INN, Asheville, North Carolina . Opening date: July 12, 1913 . Easily distinguishable by its granite exterior and red clay-tile roof, the Grove Park Inn has long been a favorite mountain retreat, hallowed for its sweeping views, Southern hospitality and rustic yet refined Arts and Crafts design. A recent $25 million renovation, timed by current owner KSL Resorts to coincide with its anniversary celebrations, ensures this grande dame is back to form; even the giant fireplace in the lobby is working again. 7 amazing island rentals . Famous guests: Thomas Edison, Helen Keller, Henry Ford . Historical fact: In 1930, William Howard Taft resigned from the Supreme Court in the hotel's Great Hall. HÔTEL PLAZA ATHÉNÉE, Paris, France . Opening date: April 20, 1913 . Almost immediately after it opened, this testament to French culture and style became the place to see and be seen in Paris, and it remains so to this day. Now part of the Dorchester Collection, the hotel features 191 elegantly appointed rooms and suites pairing 18th-century-style touches with modern conveniences like remote-controlled air-conditioning. And you'll not just sleep well here, but eat well, too, given that all four of its restaurants fall under the supervision of famed French-born chef Alain Ducasse. Go underground: Cave hotels . Famous guests: Marlene Dietrich, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Jackie Kennedy . Historical fact: Legendary designer Christian Dior loved the hotel so much he opened his House of Dior on the same street, and avenue Montaigne soon became the capital of high fashion. HOTEL DU PONT, Wilmington, Delaware . Opening date: January 15, 1913 . With its elaborate woodwork, polished terrazzo floors and plush Queen Anne furnishings, the Hotel du Pont is a perfect example of the extravagance of America's Gilded Age. Additions over the years include elegant ballrooms, dozens more guestrooms, a theater substantial enough to house a Broadway show and a collection of notable artworks by the likes of N.C. and Andrew Wyeth. 6 hot resorts for adults only . Famous guests: King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Amelia Earhart, Eleanor Roosevelt . Historical fact: The hotel was conceived by a pair of DuPont executives as a place for people to stay while visiting their Brandywine Valley headquarters, yet no expense was spared in its creation and the final bill totaled an estimated $1 million, a hefty sum at that time. FORT GARRY HOTEL, Winnipeg, Manitoba . Opening date: December 10, 1913 . The Fort Garry is one of a group of grand hotels built by the Canadian National Railway in the early 20th century to increase travel along its transcontinental routes. These château-inspired accommodations quickly grew in popularity, and while some have fallen by the wayside, the Fort Garry maintains its glitz and glamour, a fact that recently heralded it a spot on a list of the 10 most romantic spots in Canada. Famous guests: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Jack Dempsey, Liberace . Historical fact: The hotel once had its own bakery, butcher shop, heating plant, artesian well and printing press. The latter remains but is only accessible through a doorway on the roof. BENSON HOTEL, Portland, Oregon . Opening date: March 4, 1913 . The success of the Benson Hotel can be attributed to Simon Benson, an emigrant from Norway who moved to Portland and made a fortune in the lumber business. Ever the pioneer, he took a hotel that bled cash for the first 16 months of its life (it was originally called the New Oregon Hotel) and transformed it into a world-class property that now sits on the National Register of Historic Places. Managed today by Coast Hotels, it still oozes Benson's influences, from the Austrian crystal chandeliers to the Circassian walnut columns. Famous guests: Every seated president since William H. Taft . Historical fact: Back in the day, guests of the hotel were greeted each morning with a complimentary cup of hot clam nectar. Today, it's a cup of hot coffee. HOTEL SAVOY, Moscow, Russia . Opening date: March 30, 1913 . The two aren't related, but much like the Savoy Hotel in London, Moscow's Savoy is a landmark property dripping with opulence, albeit in a much smaller, more intimate setting. Designed as a haven for aristocrats visiting from Saint Petersburg and beyond, it still draws Russia's elite, who can often be found hobnobbing in the lobby bar. Another beloved feature is its location, which is just steps from top sights like the Kremlin, the Bolshoi and St. Basil's Cathedral. Famous guests: Isadora Duncan, Luciano Pavarotti, Richard Gere . Historical fact: The Hotel Savoy was built by the Salamander Fire Insurance Company, and images of salamanders can be found in the carpets, the pool and elsewhere throughout the property. GSTAAD PALACE, Gstaad, Switzerland . Opening date: December 8, 1913 . Gstaad is one of Europe's favorite winter sports destinations, but guests flock to this old-school resort year-round, enticed by the lighted tennis courts, Olympic-size swimming pool, high-end fitness center with saunas and massage rooms, and the hundreds of miles of hike and bike trails that weave through the Bernese Alps surrounding the property. One of the few family-owned and -operated hotels in Switzerland, the Gstaad Palace makes a point to treat its guests like one of their own, and the result is a boom in repeat visitors. Famous guests: Marc Chagall, Madonna, Jimmy Carter . Historical fact: Owing to the Palace's isolated mountainside location, the Swiss government found it a fitting place to stash a chunk of its gold reserves during World War II. GRANDE COLONIAL, La Jolla, California . Opening date: February 1, 1913 . Given the Grande Colonial's spectacular seaside setting in a charming suburb of San Diego, it's not hard to see how the hotel has survived for the last hundred years. Or how it could easily make it another hundred. The property has undergone multiple renovations over the decades, including an $8 million restoration completed in 2007 and a recent overhaul of the entry, lobby and adjacent public spaces, both meant to preserve the hotel's original European-style ambiance and aesthetic. Famous guests: Groucho Marx, Jane Wyatt and a couple of ghosts said to haunt the hotel's hallways . Historical fact: The pharmacist at a drugstore that became part of the hotel back in 1928 was the father of actor Gregory Peck, who grew up in the area and later co-founded the La Jolla Playhouse.","The Grove Park Inn celebrates its 100th birthday in July .

"(CNN) -- Naturalist Beth Pratt has been exploring and celebrating wildlife since she was a child, whether discovering the great whales of Cape Cod with her parents or creating a special luxury habitat for her backyard frogs. As a young girl she gazed with longing at photos of grizzly bears and wolves, and vowed to see the charismatic mega-fauna of the West. She realized her dream in her 20-year career in environmental leadership has included work at Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks. She's the director of the National Wildlife Federation's California office, living just outside Yosemite. Pratt has wandered extensively throughout Yosemite's backcountry, hiked the John Muir Trail, swam the mile-long Tenaya Lake in Yosemite and run the Cape Cod Marathon with her father and ""survived"" (her word) the Tioga Pass Run: a 12.4-mile trek entirely uphill gaining 3,000 feet in elevation to arrive at the entrance of Yosemite. To mark Earth Day 2013, CNN.com asked Pratt to share some of her favorite spots to find nature. Here are some of her recommendations and what makes each wild place special, in her own words: . Gaylor Lakes Trail, Yosemite National Park, California . Yosemite National Park is my favorite place on Earth, and the area near Tioga Pass is my favorite place in Yosemite. My annual rite of spring is hiking the Gaylor Lakes trail. Depending on the snowpack levels, in some years I've trekked through deep snow, while in other years the trail has been bone dry. Gaylor Lakes offers an array of wonders -- five shimmering blue, subalpine lakes, views of Yosemite's high peaks, colorful spring wildflowers like lupine and monkey flower, and ruins of the Great Sierra silver mine. There are also possible encounters with some of my favorite critters: the unbearably cute pika and the annual spring love songs of the Yosemite toad and Pacific chorus frogs. This trail starts right at the Tioga Pass entrance station (almost 10,000 feet in elevation) and is great for all levels of hikers as you can stop at the first view (about three-quarters of a mile) and call it a day or do the whole five-mile loop. The first three-quarters of a mile is all uphill, but you are rewarded with stunning views of Yosemite's high country at the top, including the Cathedral Range, Kuna Crest and Mount Dana as well as middle Gaylor Lake. Don't stop there, as the rest of the hike allows you to wander through a sublime, expansive basin and is much less strenuous. Mount Washburn, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming . When I worked in Yellowstone and people asked me what to do if they only had a day in the park, I would recommend the Mount Washburn hike. Yellowstone is in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, but Mount Washburn is in Wyoming. It's easily the best trail in Yellowstone in terms of bang for your wildlife, wildflower and scenery buck. In just the drive alone to Mount Washburn in springtime, no matter what your approach, nature will reward you with some unprecedented wildlife sightings, as it's the seasonal baby boom in Yellowstone, which includes the adorable orange bison calves, and gangly elk youngsters, along with grizzly and black bears cubs. Spring is the best time for wildlife viewing in Yellowstone, and my record is eight grizzly bears, one wolf and one moose (and countless bison, bighorn, pronghorn and elk) in one day. Dunraven Pass is usually awash with yellow flowers in springtime as well. On the hike, you'll be strolling through wildflower gardens, which usually peak in July and August. And you'll likely encounter the herds of bighorn sheep that frequent the rocky terrain. It's rare to see rams here, but the cuteness of the playful antics of the young lambs more than compensates. The hike to the summit is six miles round trip and with access usually in June, just depending on the snowpack. Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina and Tennessee . On a visit to the Great Smoky Mountains a few years ago, I searched of course for frogs (the park has 13 species of frogs and toad), but saw a bright red salamander crawling on a rock during a hike, and when I asked my guide about its species, I learned an amazing fact -- the Great Smoky Mountains are known as the ""Salamander Capital of the World."" The area houses five families of salamanders and 30 species. They are nicknamed ""spring lizards"" in the Appalachians, although they are technically not lizards. The Hellbender salamander, the largest in the Great Smoky Mountains, can reach 29 inches in length. Some places to see salamanders in springtime, near any wet area in the park, include Grotto Falls at the Trillium Gap Trailhead; Ramsey Cascades (the tallest waterfall in the park); Cove Hardwood self-guiding nature trail, which starts from Chimney's Picnic Area; and Little River Watershed for the Hellbender salamanders. The Ash Hooper Branch Wildflower Trail is one of the best hikes for wildflowers and also pretty good for salamanders. Lands End Coastal Trail, San Francisco . I recently discovered the beginning of this incredible trail with magnificent views of California's rocky coast when I went to Sutro Baths at Lands End in search of Sutro Sam, the first river otter in San Francisco in more than 50 years. While I snapped photos of him swimming playfully in the bathhouse ruins, someone yelled, ""Dolphins."" I turned around and saw bottlenose dolphins and their calves swimming in the Pacific. For wildlife, more than 200 species of resident and migratory birds have been sighted here. Fall is the big bird migration, but springtime is no slouch either (April and May). For me, what makes this hike special (now that Sutro Sam has ventured off in search of a mate) is the possibility of marine mammal sightings. Aside from the bottlenose dolphins I saw, you might also observe gray whales and harbor porpoises. Harbor porpoises have recently returned to the San Francisco Bay after 65 years, and it's always great to see them frolicking. I recommend doing the easy 3.5-mile trip that starts at Sutro Baths near the Cliff House Restaurant. If it's clear, you'll get a view of the Marin Headlands and the Golden Gate Bridge, walk among willows, cypress and Monterey Pines, and see some native wildflowers. Beartooth Highway, Montana and Wyoming . The late CBS News travel correspondent Charles Kuralt called U.S. 212, or Beartooth Highway, ""the most beautiful road in America."" For me, it's true. My jaw dropped open in awe the entire drive; this was a continual scenic vista on steroids. I recommend you drive this magnificent 67-mile highway by all means, but get out of the car as well. There are many beautiful lakes to see a short walk from the road. The Island Lake trailhead, one mile east of the Top of the World Store at the end of a short road to Island Lake Campground, provides as much or as little a hike as you like. Be sure to look (and listen) for pika along the route. Besides frog, pika are a favorite critter of mine. These intrepid creatures live at high altitudes and do not hibernate in the winter. Instead they gather vegetation in haystacks to dry for winter forage. And they are also unbearably cute. Listen for their distinctive high-pitched chirping as you walk through rocky terrain. And the springtime wildflowers are stunning. I cherish the delicate sky pilot because the flowers seem to me like precious gems worn by the mountains. But the endless meadows filled with a purple-blue ocean of lupine, or the sunset orange-red of the Indian paintbrush (Wyoming's state flower) will leave you speechless. The road usually opens, depending on snow conditions, mid-April to mid-June. Platte River, Nebraska . In college, I drove across country every summer, visiting national parks and other wild areas. One year I visited friends in Kearney, Nebraska, the Sandhill Crane Migration capital of the world. As we strolled along the Platte River, I was disappointed to learn I would just miss the fall stop over. The Sandhill Crane migration is a truly remarkable event. More than 80% of all of the world's sandhill cranes (about 500,000) make a pit stop in spring here before heading north to their summer breeding grounds. In addition, more than 10 million ducks and geese travel here as well. That's a lot of birds. The spring migration runs from February to April. If you want to avoid the crowds and get out of the cars, birding friends recommend the North Platte Area such as at Buffalo Bill State Historic Park. In the Kearney area, Audubon's Rowe Sanctuary offers tours for a fee. Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts . Cape Cod is my childhood wilderness, where I came to love both nature and the outdoors because of my parents' affection for the place. We vacationed there annually throughout my youth, and eventually moved to the edge of Cape Cod, Plymouth, when I was in high school. I remember my dad taking me to see beached whales as a kid -- and live ones on whale watching trips -- and swimming in the waters of Cape Cod National Seashore. My favorite discovery on the beaches of Cape Cod was the horseshoe crabs. These relics from the dinosaur age transfixed me, and I would collect what I thought back then were dead horseshoe crabs -- I now know it's their molted shells -- and bring them home to study. Finding a live one in the water was always a delight. Watching the horseshoe crabs spawn by the full moon, which they do generally from April to June, has always been a highlight for me. In my talks about California wildlife, I always end with a photo of a horseshoe crab, even though we lack the animal on the Pacific Coast. For me these ancient creatures engendered my love of wildlife, and they remind me of the wonder of running around the beaches of Cape Cod as a kid, excitedly searching for these prehistoric creatures in the soft sand.","An annual rite of spring is hiking the Gaylor Lakes trail at Yosemite National Park .

"(CNN) -- The investigation of the Washington Navy Yard shootings is yielding information about the shooter's background and possible motives. One significant one: The Associated Press reported that officials said Aaron Alexis was ""suffering a host of serious mental issues, including paranoia and a sleep disorder. He also had been hearing voices in his head."" Mental illness frequently emerges as part of the background of America's mass shootings, including those in Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado; and Newtown, Connecticut. In those cases, it was quickly discovered that acquaintances, family, school officials -- sometimes mental health providers -- knew about the suspects' psychiatric problems. Bureaucratic roadblocks hindered the communications between police and the individual or agency mental health providers who had had contact with these men before they lashed out. Law enforcement and the Navy will be doing the police work to figure out how and why Monday's shooting occurred and what further steps are needed. However, the rest of us could consider how a country that stigmatizes mental illness and places a low priority on mental health care increases the chance of such tragedies occurring regularly, with devastating effects on families and communities. Opinion: Get serious about mental health care . Now, with respect to Aaron Alexis and the Washington Navy Yard killings, the suspect indeed appeared to have mental health problems. He'd sought help from Veterans Affairs hospitals around the capital, law enforcement sources told CNN. And after an incident in Seattle in which he shot out the tires on the car of a man he thought had mocked him, his family told police that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his having been in New York City on September 11, 2001 (although work colleagues of his from back then don't recall his volunteering in the aftermath of that attack). Alexis had apparently asked for help from the VA for psychiatric problems but was not declared unfit by the Navy, which could have revoked his security clearance and perhaps prevented him from gaining ready access to the Navy Yard grounds. The question that needs to be addressed in the coming days and months is: Why do barriers to communication across agencies exist, and how can they be reduced or eliminated? These are not simple questions, but they are extremely important when it comes to prevention. These are the practical concerns of a police investigation trying to unravel motivation and understand how such an attack could have occurred. But there is a human and community dimension to this tragedy that needs attention as well. It's important to remember, for example, that the mentally ill are far, far more often the victims of violence than its perpetrators. Research consistently suggests that the mentally ill, if they do not abuse drugs and alcohol and if they stay in treatment, are actually less likely to commit violence than other populations. Further, research has also highlighted that if violence does occur, it is family members and friends who are the most likely to be the victims (85% of the time, or more). That well-grounded fact is not a reason to ignore the troubling and continuing erosion of mental health services as a result of government budget cuts -- nearly $5 billion in three years and affecting nearly all the states. These cuts have decreased the availability of mental health services at the school and community level both for those suffering mental health problems and for others who have family members who are mentally ill. Adequately funding such services could make a difference in curbing violence. Opinion: Masculinity, mental illness and guns - a lethal equation? As reductions in services occur, the police and jails are increasingly absorbing a population of mentally ill people who end up committing crimes. The jails become mental health providers at much higher costs then mental health outpatient services. For example, in New York City's Rikers Island jail the mentally ill constitute over 30% of all inmates and the cost of incarceration for a year is over $165,000. Thankfully, the federal government and mental health advocates at a recent White House conference defined important, much-needed steps, such as a new website for mental health information, expansions of mental health funding through the Affordable Care Act, and modest new funding for communities in crisis. However, this new federal money is small compared to that lost in state cutbacks. Thus the needs will continue to be great. The families of the victims in the Navy Yard massacre, as well as the survivors, need ongoing supportive services, and this should be a priority. But we cannot and should not stop there. The need for better mental health care is truly nationwide, and extensive new programming is needed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gerald Landsberg.","Gerald Landsberg: Navy Yard shooter appears to have had mental health problems .
He says communication between agencies might have prevented massacre .
He says nation must prioritize mental health treatment; instead cuts have led to less care .
Landsberg: Obama mental health initiatives a good step; shooting shows much more needed ."
"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- The sounds of clanking pots and pans and bursting fireworks rang out in Caracas on Tuesday night as tensions mounted over Venezuela's tight election results. It was a clear sign that days after Sunday's presidential vote, fierce political battles are far from over in the deeply divided country. Supporters of opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski banged pots and pans to protest the government's refusal to recount the votes, while supporters of President-elect Nicolas Maduro set off fireworks to celebrate his victory and drown out the noise. Maduro, former President Hugo Chavez's handpicked successor, is scheduled to be sworn in on Friday. Election authorities proclaimed him president-elect on Monday despite Capriles' demand for a recount. On Tuesday, Venezuela's top prosecutor said at least seven people had been killed and 61 had been injured in post-election violence across the country. And the state-run AVN news agency reported that authorities had arrested 135 people in connection with political violence. The government news agency tied the deaths to opposition protests and said the victims were all followers of Maduro. Government health clinics, food distribution centers, a bank and a preschool program were the targets of violence, officials said. CNN could not independently confirm the government reports of violence, and it was unknown whether there were any opposition injuries or fatalities. Maduro secured 50.8% of votes in Sunday's election, while opposition candidate Capriles won 49%, Venezuela's National Electoral Council said. Since the tally was announced, both Capriles and Maduro have publicly urged supporters to remain peaceful while also accusing each other of inciting violence. The issue of post-election clashes swiftly became a flashpoint for a new round of political sparring Tuesday, as Capriles repeated his calls for a recount and Maduro vowed to use an iron fist to crack down on any attempts to unseat him from the presidency. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Capriles presented a list of alleged election violations that he said impacted hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, including problems with voting machines, inconsistencies in tallies reported by voting centers and reports that opposition witnesses were forced out of hundreds of polls. ""The right to demand the counting of votes in a country where there is democracy....cannot be a crime,"" he told CNN en EspaÃ±ol in an exclusive interview Tuesday night. Capriles called off plans to protest at the central office of Venezuela's election authority in Caracas on Wednesday, saying the government had planned to infiltrate their ranks and provoke violence. Anyone who takes to the streets Wednesday, he said, is not affiliated with his campaign. ""The government wants there to be deaths in the country,"" he said, accusing authorities of using violence to distract from his push for a recount. ""We are not going to step into that trap,"" Capriles told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Hours before the protest was canceled, Maduro had said the planned opposition protest in Caracas was illegal and accused opposition leaders of a plot to massacre their own people and later blame the government. Maduro has not responded to CNN's interview requests. In nationally televised remarks Tuesday, he accused the U.S. Embassy of fueling opposition violence. ""The U.S. Embassy is the one who has financed and directed all the acts of violence in this country. It has financed these neo-Nazi groups,"" he said. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to Maduro's accusation, but last month a spokeswoman said ""the United States categorically rejects allegations of any U.S. government involvement in any plots to destabilize the Venezuelan government or to harm anyone in Venezuela."" If violence surges, Maduro said he would not hold back from taking action. ""If they continue with the violence,"" he said, ""what we can do is radicalize this revolution."" As heated public comments from Maduro and Capriles filled the airwaves, sharp accusations surged in social media. In a series of Twitter posts Tuesday, a top official in Maduro's United Socialist Party of Venezuela blamed Capriles for the violence and called for a criminal investigation of the opposition candidate. ""Fascist Capriles, I will personally see that you pay for all of the damage that you're doing to our homeland and our people,"" said Diosdado Cabello, president of Venezuela's National Assembly. ""They chased after doctors, burned dwellings, you caused all of this, Capriles, you irresponsible one."" Another congressman, Pedro Carreno, said in a Twitter post that authorities should arrest Capriles. A spokesman for Carreno's office told CNN that the congressman planned to call for a debate on the issue in the National Assembly Tuesday. Andres Izarra, a top official for Maduro's campaign, said in a Twitter post that Capriles should be imprisoned. As the National Assembly met Tuesday, Cabello told lawmakers that he would only recognize those who recognize Maduro as president. ""If you do not recognize the president, I do not recognize you as congressmen,"" he said, ""because you were elected by the same (system)."" Analysis: Why Venezuela is so divided? CNN's Paula Newton reported from Caracas. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN's Fernando del Rincon, Jose Armijo and journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report.","Capriles: ""The right to demand the counting of votes...cannot be a crime""

"(CNN) -- She's really very stealthy. Nina Katchadourian has been creating unusual works of art from her airplane seat -- and occasionally the lavatory -- since 2010, and during the 101 flights since she started flying in a ""furiously alert and creative"" state, only three people have ever asked about her in-flight activities. Those activities include photographing disaster scenarios, seat-buckle seatmate portraits, snack sculptures and more with her iPhone for a body of work called ""Seat Assignment."" Katchadourian's years-long project was born on a 2010 flight from New York to Atlanta when she decided that instead of trying to make the time go away or to pretend she wasn't trapped in a metal tube, she'd create things within the spacial and material limitations of an airplane. World's 100 best beaches . ""It's an ongoing experiment with the interesting tension between freedom and constraint,"" she said. ""What can you do with very little? And when you're forced to think that way I think you start becoming inventive and you have to think expansively and quite freely for anything to happen."" That free thinking led the Brooklyn-based artist to a series of self-portraits in the airplane lavatory where strategically placed toilet seat covers and paper towels provide the flavor of 15th-century Flemish portraiture. That segment of the project is complete -- thanks to several bathroom photo shoots during a 14-hour flight to New Zealand. The trip was particularly productive for Katchadourian, who was on her way to become an artist in residence in Dunedin in 2011. She created an entire exhibit for the Dunedin Public Art Gallery on the way to her post. But she's not always so busy on planes -- sometimes she takes a nap or watches a movie like the rest of us. CNN spoke with Katchadourian recently about her unique approach to air travel. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity: . CNN: Do you talk to your seatmates? It's very interesting. I feel like years ago, there was a very different attitude around that kind of social situation with who you were sitting next to, and I can remember getting on planes and being even a little bit sort of excited and curious about who I'd be sitting next to. You know, there would inevitably be a little bit of conversation about ""How are you doing?"" and ""Where are you headed?"" and I feel like that has sort of stopped in recent years. It really rarely happens anymore. So it seems to be more common that people sit in their seat, and they want to just stay in their zone, and you've kind of purchased your tiny piece of space on the plane and you're trying not to trespass. And so no, there has been very little conversation. And on 101 flights, I've had exactly three people, ever, ask me questions about what I was up to. And I think in part that's because I'm fairly stealthy about what I'm doing. I mean, I think that ... the camera phone is important because I essentially kind of look like a bored person trying to pass the time. I'm just kind of taking these random-looking snapshots of things in front of me. And I really don't want it to look like I'm making art. I want it to look like, in fact, I do sort of want it to look like I'm a bored person. So the very thing I'm trying not to be sort of becomes my alibi in a strange way. Probably the funniest question that's come my way was on a flight ... heading back from London to New York. I'd been busy making a little stop-action animation on my tray table using a postcard I'd bought from the National Gallery and some sugar that I had poured on the postcard, and I was poking with one finger while I took pictures with the other hand. And I was sort of making this sugar shape swirl around on top of this image, and I finished that and I started working on something else, also using the sugar, and the guy next to me said, ""I think the previous one was turning out better,"" and I thought, ""Uh oh, I've had an audience and I haven't even known that."" Camping: Horror or bliss? CNN: When did you start the portraits in the lavatory? So the first one of those happened on a domestic flight, I guess about six months before the New Zealand trip. And it was also a very spontaneous moment. I had just been in the bathroom and before I walked out, I took one of those tissue paper seat covers and put it on my head and thought ""Huh, that's odd. I remind myself a little bit of a Flemish painting."" And you know, ""Why did I just make that?"" I didn't really know. But in the spirit of the project, you kind of try everything, and I try not to talk myself out of anything. So if something comes to mind, I give it a shot. And then I kept thinking about that one photograph, and I thought I'd really like to make a few more of those. And on a 14-hour leg from San Francisco to Auckland I was pretty sure that there would be long stretches of time when people would be asleep and when the bathrooms wouldn't be occupied. And so I kind of banked on that and got an aisle seat so that I would be able to get in and out of my seat easily without disturbing anyone. And sure enough there was never a line, people were asleep for hours upon hours of that long flight and I had plenty of opportunity to go back there and make a few more of these portraits. Can the 'game-changer' still live up to its name? CNN: What's a shooting stretch in the lavatory? How long does that take? Well, my very first foray back there was probably a few minutes because I was very, I don't know, I just thought, ""I have to hurry up. I have to do this fast. What if there's someone waiting to get in here?"" But there never was. I maybe made five or six forays to the bathroom and I think by the end I was spending 15 minutes in there comfortably without worrying about it so much. And that series, that happened on that one flight. That series is complete. I have not added to it. It's done. I consider that kind of a finished project. CNN: These photos are kind of fun and optimistic. Do you think that sets you apart from other travelers? Well, they actually aren't all fun and optimistic. I think it's also important to see a whole category of pictures that have been part of this project as a reflection on the anxiety that I also feel when I travel. There's a whole huge category called ""Disasters"" where I'm crumbling up pretzels and making landslides or taking sweater lint off my sweater and making smoking plumes that come out of airplane jets and all these kind of imagined things that can go wrong. There's also a way to see ""Seat Assignment"" as a project that helps me cope with the low grade, for me low-grade, stress of travel. You know when you fly, you're inside this metal tube full of a couple hundred people you don't know and you're hurtling through space. And on one hand, this has become very mundane and it feels a little like getting on a bus, but on the other hand, there are moments when I think, ""this is completely crazy,"" and it's very anxiety provoking to imagine things going wrong. I think that for me, ""Seat Assignment"" is such an absorbing and distracting project that when I'm really dug into making something, I'm very content. I'm really happy, I'm really absorbed, I'm really in the moment, I guess you could say, and I don't sit there worrying or feeling kind of squashed in my seat or anxious or uncomfortable if it gets turbulent or any of those kinds of things. So the project really has -- there are many temperaments within it. CNN: Do you have the same process when you're traveling with someone? I'd say 90% of them are work trips, and as a result I'm usually traveling alone. So when there is someone I know next to me, of course then I don't ever have to wonder, ""What is the person next to me thinking?"" because they know. That's part of the challenge too, is how far am I willing to go. ... I really don't ever want the project to become intrusive. ... Gum, for example. I've done a few things with chewing gum, but ... I really don't ever do things with chewing gum if there's someone next to me who I don't know because I feel like it's just a little too impolite. CNN: Will this series have an end? I don't know. For the moment it's ongoing and I keep adding to it, and I really feel like it hasn't played out yet. So as long as I feel that way, it's gonna keep going. Some of Katchadourian's ""Seat Assignment"" work is on view through September 15 in an exhibition at Turner Contemporary in Margate, England, called ""Curiosity: Art and the Pleasures of Knowing."" Starting in June, a show at the Saatchi Gallery in London will feature some of her work as well.","Artist Nina Katchadourian has been using her camera phone to make art on flights since 2010 .

"(CNN) -- [Breaking news alert, 1:39 p.m. ET] . Authorities in Piermont, New York, believe that they have recovered the body of Mark Lennon, the second victim of a boating accident involving a wedding party on the Hudson River, Sheriff Louis Falco told reporters Sunday. Lennon was the best man in the group. [Previously published story, 12:10 p.m. ET] . The path that led Lindsey Stewart and Brian Bond to decide to join their lives together was as measured and deliberate as its end was abrupt. The two had been friends since they were children living in the suburbs north of New York City. They went to the same church. More than three years ago, the relationship turned romantic. Next month, the 30-year-old human resources manager at an insurance company in Nyack, and her 36-year-old beau were to marry at Good Shepherd Church in Pearl River. The reception was to be at Torne Valley Winery in Hillburn. ""She did all the plans herself,"" her stepfather, Walter Kosik, told CNN. ""She had everything under control."" On Friday night, Stewart and Bond and four of their friends dined at a restaurant, then boarded a 21-foot Stingray power boat on the Hudson River for what was to have been a short ride from the village of Piermont in Rockland County to Tarrytown. It was a clear, balmy night. The short ride and the couple's long-term plans collided fatally when the boat struck the side of one of three barges that were lashed together at a construction site near the Tappan Zee Bridge, 25 miles north of Manhattan. The barges, which were being used by a contractor who is building a new bridge, had been anchored in the river since around April, said Robert Van Cura, undersheriff of the Rockland County Sheriff's Office. Stewart was thrown from the boat, as was Mark Lennon, who was to have served as the couple's best man. Despite suffering serious head injuries, Bond, Stewart's fiance, called 911 from the boat at 10:41 p.m., reporting that it had struck an object south of the bridge. Rescuers poured in from around the area, but to no avail. At 2:30 a.m. Saturday, the police showed up at the house belonging to Stewart's mother and stepfather. ""That's something -- a nightmare -- I don't wish on any parent, to get that police coming over your house waking you out of your sleep to tell you that an accident has occurred,"" Kosik said. A few hours later, a body believed to be that of Stewart's was discovered about an eighth of a mile off the riverbank. The search for Lennon, which proved fruitless Saturday, was to resume Sunday morning, but officials held out little hope he would be found alive. ""We're always hopeful, but obviously, at this hour, it's less and less likely that this would be a rescue as opposed to a recovery,"" Van Cura told reporters. The four who were not thrown from the boat suffered head injuries and were taken to area hospitals. One of them, boat operator Jojo K. John, 35, was arrested. ""We have probable cause to believe that he operated the boat while intoxicated,"" Van Cura said. John was arraigned at an area hospital on one count of first-degree vehicular manslaughter and three counts of second-degree vehicular assault, Van Cura said. More charges are possible, he said. Van Cura said the operator was not the registered owner of the boat, which may have more than one owner. Bond was hospitalized at Westchester Medical Center, said Kosik, who visited him Saturday.

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's main opposition on Tuesday boycotted the ceremony for a new parliamentary session, during which President Robert Mugabe appealed to the West to lift sanctions on him and his Zanu PF party leadership. ""With the elections now behind us, we look forward to meaningful and effective collaboration with all progressive members of the global community,"" Mugabe said. ""We indeed stand ready to work with those, who, before were at odds with us; our detractors. On the other hand, Zimbabwe will continue to demand the immediate and unconditional removal of illegal sanctions imposed by some Western arrogant countries,"" said the 89-year-old leader.

"(CNN) -- Call it a watershed moment for Kenya. Scientists found massive underground water supplies in the arid northern region. The discovery of the reserves could improve the lives of generations and halt long-running conflicts over natural resources. The United Nations said it identified five aquifers in parched Turkana, two of which have been verified. ""Two aquifers ... were identified using advanced satellite exploration technology,"" its cultural agency, UNESCO, said in a statement Wednesday. ""Their existence was then confirmed by drilling conducted recently by UNESCO, but there is need for further studies to adequately quantify the reserves and to assess the quality of the water,"" UNESCO said. An additional three aquifers have been found in the same area, but have not been confirmed by drilling and will need further assessment, it said. In a country where water is scarce, the revelation is crucial. Kenya has a population of about 41 million, with nearly 17 million lacking access to safe water, according to the United Nations. More than half the population -- about 28 million -- lack adequate sanitation. ""The news about these water reserves comes at a time when reliable water supplies are highly needed,"" said Judi Wakhungu, the nation's cabinet secretary for the environment, water and natural resources. ""This newly found wealth of water opens a door to a more prosperous future for the people of Turkana and the nation as a whole. We must now work to further explore these resources responsibly and safeguard them for future generations."" In addition to replenishing scarce water supplies in the nation, the underground resources will boost agriculture in the region, which has long battled arid conditions. The nation faces water insecurity exacerbated by erratic rainfall patterns, triggering battles for natural resources among various communities. Deadly cattle raids and conflicts over grazing land are common in the area. The underground supplies will also provide irrigation and livestock needs, drinking water, and help ward off malnutrition in the region. The project between UNESCO and the Kenyan government was funded by Japan. Kenya will conduct more studies to determine the quantity and the quality of the water.","U.N. says it identified five aquifers in Turkana .

"(CNN) -- As often as we talk about ""getting away from it all,"" it's rare to find a retreat that drops us in another era. Most accommodations assume guests need soft sheets, WiFi and a certain predictability to feel at home. Yet for many travelers, ease and convenience take a backseat to authenticity, and the best place to stay is the one that will startle you out of your everyday life. That's why at some destinations, the absence of electricity and running water are selling points. Elsewhere, bygone eras are carefully conjured to create a sense of living history. 8 hotels still fresh at 100 . Try staying in one of these five spots if you're looking for a dramatic perspective shift: . Shack Up Inn, Clarksdale, Mississippi . In the Mississippi Delta, timeworn sharecroppers' shacks once dotted the landscape. But as farm workers, both black and white, left the region in search of better jobs, shacks were left derelict and often destroyed. Enter the Shack Up Inn in Clarksdale. Owners Guy Malvezzi, Bill Talbot and a few other locals opened the now 38-room inn in 1998 in part to preserve an endangered piece of history. They were inspired with the idea after one set up his own shack on the former Hopson Plantation, located three miles from the crossroads of Highways 46 and 61, where legend has it blues musician Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil for his guitar-playing skills. Passing tourists from as far away as Europe and Asia began inquiring about renting the shack. ""I said, you know, we could have a nice little business here, but we need more shacks,"" recalls Malvezzi, whose own grandfathers grew up in migrant shacks. Soon they were transporting shacks from up to 30 miles away, most built between the 1920s and the 1950s. As the supply dwindled, Malvezzi and Talbot began buying and ""funking up"" eco shacks made with structurally insulated panels. They also fixed up rooms (or ""bins"") in the plantation's one-time cotton gin. No one's pretending a stay at the Shack Up Inn resembles the harsh lives sharecroppers endured. Bins and shacks come with air conditioning, plumbing and even Internet access, but don't expect sheet thread-count specs and wake-up calls. The ethos is rooted instead in ""a down-home feel,"" says Malvezzi, whose target market encompasses blues enthusiasts, artists and those interested in history and the civil rights movement. The area's musical heritage is a key part of the Shack Up experience. The inn hosts a harmonica workshop three times a year and recently held its first blues guitar and bass camp. Such modern-day legends as Robert Plant and Tom Waits have been known to spend the night. Shack Up Inn is open year round. Rooms vary in style, size and price, but most are $65-$80 per night with a two-night minimum stay on weekends. You must be 25 years or older to rent a room. 662-624-8329. 6 hot resorts for adults only . Historic Occidental Hotel, Buffalo, Wyoming . Once a landmark of the old west, the Historic Occidental Hotel in Buffalo, Wyoming, was closed and slated for destruction when Dawn Wexo and her late husband, John, moved to town in 1997. Seeking a home for their publishing company, the couple purchased the property. ""When we started walking through it we realized, 'My God, this is a time capsule,'"" says Wexo. Among the treasures they uncovered: original wainscoting, decorated tin ceilings and a telegraph key used by invaders in the fabled Johnson County War. They decided to restore the Occidental, which once sheltered the likes of Buffalo Bill, Butch Cassidy and Theodore Roosevelt. Five rooms opened in 2003; there are now 16 with the restoration complete. The building doubles as a 501(c)3 museum with free admission, and Wexo is determined that visitors enjoy ""a complete sensory experience,"" from squeaky floors and bullet holes in the saloon to vintage radios piping 1920s music. An 8,000-volume library draws guests into quiet time: ""People discover it and they don't go back to their rooms to watch television,"" Wexo says. The atmosphere even impresses kids. ""I see those iPhones go down."" Rooms are $75-$195 in peak season, not including breakfast. 307-684-0451. Mullins Log Cabin, Grant County, Kentucky . Soon after Abraham Lincoln's birth in a log cabin in rural Kentucky, the Mullins Log Cabin was built in the state's Grant County. Owner Judy Mullins acquired the building in the early '90s and has been renting it ever since to families, school groups and others seeking a rustic getaway. With no running water, electricity or insulation, the cabin offers a good idea of what life was like more than a century and a half ago. Oil lamps and a wood stove provide light and heat, but the most popular months for the cabin are temperate ones. In warmer weather guests can loll in a clawfoot bathtub out back and cross a small creek to find a grill. There are wooded areas for hiking, and Mullins teaches workshops on chair weaving and the uses of local herbs. Or you may prefer to ponder all this humble cabin has witnessed. Based on its location, Mullins believes Civil War soldiers heading to battle in nearby Cynthiana likely dropped by. Rental is $65 a night. 859-322-3082. Kolarbyn, Skinnskatteberg, Sweden . The grass-covered huts of Kolarbyn in Skinnskatteberg, Sweden, look straight out of a woodland fairytale. In fact, they're the kind of dwelling Swedish forest workers used for hundreds of years. About 80 miles from Stockholm, this lakeside resort comprises 11 huts and a wood cabin. With no electricity or plumbing, visitors get a camper's proximity to nature, with some notable extras: fireplaces, sheepskin rugs and a floating sauna, to name a few. The extreme simplicity of Kolarbyn has attracted guests from 76 countries, by the count of owner Andreas AhlsÃ©n. Families are welcome. ""Kids love it. They're just playing around and they forget all these toys and modern stuff."" Guests can also partake in survival courses and guided wildlife watching tours featuring moose, beavers and even wolves. But there's no fear of huffing and puffing outside these huts, says AhlsÃ©n. ""The wolves in Sweden are very shy."" Kolarbyn is open on weekends in winter, daily in summer. Lodging is about $60 a night for adults, $35 for children. 46-70/400-7053. Mountain Hotel Obersteinberg, above Stechelberg, Switzerland . When summer comes to the Swiss Alps, long days flood the Mountain Hotel Obersteinberg with natural light. At night the candles and gas lamps are lit, because this remote escape run by the von Allmen family -- built sometime in the 1800s -- is without electricity or running water. Located above the Alpine village of Stechelberg, itself 3,000 feet above sea level, Hotel Obersteinberg is reached by a two-hour uphill hike. (There's no website, but Stechelberg's tourist office has a listing). About 50 miles southwest of Lucerne, the hotel is on a working dairy farm where you can watch cheese making each morning.

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Vote-counting in Zimbabwe's hotly contested election began late Wednesday with President Robert Mugabe and main challenger Morgan Tsvangirai confident of victory. Partial results were expected to come out early Thursday, said Rita Makarau, chairwoman of the Zimbabwe Election Commission, which has until Monday to release full results. Five presidential candidates are in the race including Mugabe and Tsvangirai, the current prime minister. Makarau dismissed allegations from Tsvangirai's party that the election commission rigged the polls for Mugabe. ""I believe that the election is free and fair,"" she told journalists. ""Maybe the reports that will come out will vindicate my view of the election as free and fair."" Opinion: Is Zimbabwe ready for elections? Mugabe, 89, has been at the helm since 1980, the only president the nation has known since it gained independence from Britain. A win would extend his time in office to a potential 38 years. 'Evidence of manipulation' The vote will end an uneasy coalition government formed after violence broke out when Mugabe claimed victory over Tsvangirai in the last election five years ago. The post-election violence left 200 people dead and thousands more injured, rights groups said. Regional leaders dismissed that election as a sham and pressured Mugabe to form a power-sharing agreement with Tsvangirai and his opposition Movement for Democratic Change. As a result, the two bitter rivals entered into a tense coalition in 2009. Opposition candidates say they have no confidence in this election, either. Referring to alleged voting manipulation by Mugabe supporters, Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, said it was encouraged by a large turnout. ""Zimbabweans, we remain hopeful that the shenanigans were rendered useless by your massive support,"" the party said on its Facebook page. Days before the election, Tsvangirai, 61, said ""there is clear evidence of manipulation"" in poll preparations. He said ballot papers cast in his favor during early voting were discovered tossed in a bin. Rights groups accuse the government of intimidating and beating up opposition supporters and interfering with the polls. Mugabe's party denies the accusations. Mugabe to West: Back off . The elections were held under a new constitution endorsed in a March referendum that limits the president to two five-year terms. Mugabe is allowed to seek another term because the rule does not apply retroactively. Last week, he had a few words for critics of the upcoming election, especially the West. ""Keep your pink nose out of our affairs, please,"" he said in response to criticisms from the United States on his push for elections without key reforms. About 6.4 million voters in Zimbabwe -- half of the country's population -- were eligible to cast their ballots, according to the electoral commission. The electoral commission has five days from the close of polling to release results. Mugabe has vowed to step down if he loses. Zimbabwe, seeking election funding, turns to neighboring countries . ""You either win or lose,"" he said. ""If you lose, then you must surrender to those who have won. If you win, those who have lost then must surrender to those who have won. This is it. We will do so. Yes. Comply with the rules."" And he had a conciliatory message for Tsvangirai. ""I've got my fair share of criticisms and also dealt back rights and lefts and uppercuts. But that's the game. Although we boxed each other, with Tsvangirai, it's not as hostile as before. It's all over now. We can now shake hands,"" he said. 'A historic day for all' Mugabe and his main opponent voted at different polling stations in Harare. ""Today is a historic day for all to complete the delayed runoff of 2008,"" Tsvangirai said. ""It's an emotional moment when you see all these people coming to vote."" The prime minister has always maintained the 2008 election was rigged. At the time, the electoral commission said Tsvangirai and party had won, but not by enough to avoid a runoff. He later withdrew from the runoff, saying government loyalists had killed hundreds of his supporters. Citizens say this year's election is crucial in more ways than one. Despite the setbacks, it provides another shot at democracy. ""We are still a young country ... our democracy is still young,"" said Nigel Mugamu, who lives in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare. ""A lot of African countries have changed leadership at least once or twice. We haven't seen a new face. From that perspective, it's an exciting time. Will this be the moment it will happen?"" Hope after hyperinflation . Mugamu said a peaceful election will help boost investment. This is the first poll since Zimbabwe battled hyperinflation that left investors jittery and led many to abandon the country's currency. In 2009, the nation introduced a 100 trillion-dollar bill that was worth about $300 in U.S. currency. At the time, a loaf of bread cost about 300 billion Zimbabwean dollars. The hyperinflation forced traders to insist on international currency to hedge against losses. They preferred the U.S. dollar or South African rand, and most workers demanded their salaries in foreign currency. Despite widespread poverty, the nation has made major strides since then, experts say. ""Zimbabwe has made considerable progress in stabilizing the economy since the end of hyperinflation in 2009,"" the International Monetary Fund said last month. Since then, the nation's gross domestic product ""has grown by an average of over 7% and inflation has remained in the low single digits. Government revenues have more than doubled from 16% of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 36% of GDP in 2012, allowing the restoration of basic public services."" And as the nation returns from the brink of a crippled economy, Zimbabweans are hopeful. Linda Mukusha braved long lines and chilly morning weather to cast her vote in Harare. ""I hope Zimbabweans turn out to vote in huge numbers,"" she said. ""Whoever wins, the country needs to move forward."" She proudly displayed her inked finger to show she had cast her ballot .

"(CNN) -- Three adults and two juveniles were arrested Wednesday for allegedly terrorizing a Jewish camp in Pennsylvania. Authorities say Tyler Cole Spencer, 18, Mark Trail, 21, Cassandra Robertson, 18, and two juveniles intimidated Jewish campers and staff at Camp Bonim on three separate occasions on July 14 and 15. Spencer allegedly drove a white Ford pickup truck ""recklessly"" through the camp, ""narrowly missing several campers and staff"" and damaging fields, yards, buildings and fences, the police criminal complaint said. The group also allegedly used paintball guns to shoot Jewish campers and staff, hitting one 18-year-old camper leaving a synagogue, according to the complaint. Authorities allege members of the group also shouted anti-Semitic slurs at campers and staff, such as ""I'm gonna kill you, you f***ing Jews."" ""Go back to where the f*** you came from you god**** Jews. We don't want you here,"" Trail allegedly shouted, according to the complaint. Several campers told police they ""were scared for their lives"" when the pickup truck sped through the camp, the complaint said. ""The vicious, cruel and obscene nature of the language hurled at the campers is unspeakable,"" Wayne County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Janine Edwards said in a statement. ""Luckily none of the children suffered any serious physical injury; however, the emotional damage done is immeasurable. This is outrageous conduct and will not be tolerated."" Spencer, Trail and Robertson have been charged with several felonies and misdemeanors, including ethnic intimidation, terroristic threats, recklessly endangering another person and institutional vandalism. Spencer, of Linden, Tennessee, was charged previously with aggravated assault in a hit-and-run case. He allegedly hit a camp counselor with his pickup truck before fleeing on July 16. Spencer's bail has been set at $200,000. Bail for Trail and Robertson, who are from Wayne County, has been set at $20,000 each. Juvenile petitions were also filed against the two alleged accomplices, a 17-year-old and a 16-year-old. It is unclear if the defendants are represented at this time, and listed numbers to the defendants' families could not be found.","Three adults and two juveniles are accused of terrorizing the camp on three occasions .

"(CNN) -- A body believed to be the second victim of a boating accident involving a wedding party was recovered in the Hudson River, authorities in Piermont, New York, said Sunday. Investigators were working to positively identify the body, which is believed to be that of Mark Lennon, Rockland County, New York, Sheriff Louis Falco said. ""We're looking into every single thing,"" Falco said. ""What we're going to do is bring in an accident reconstruction team."" Lennon, who was to have been the best man in the wedding party, and bride Lindsey Stewart disappeared late Friday night when a 21-foot Stingray power boat they were passengers on struck the side of one of three barges lashed together at a construction site near the Tappan Zee Bridge, 25 miles north of Manhattan. Stewart and Lennon were thrown from the boat. Her body was recovered Saturday, but the search for Lennon continued until Sunday morning when a jet skier called police to report finding a body in the river, Falco said. Stewart and fiancÃ© Brian Bond, Lennon and three other friends boarded the power boat for what was to have been a short ride on the Hudson River from the village of Piermont in Rockland County to Tarrytown. They had just dined at a restaurant. Despite suffering serious head injuries, Bond called 911 from the boat, reporting that it had struck an object south of the bridge. The four others who were not thrown from the boat suffered head injuries and were taken to area hospitals. The barges, which were being used by a contractor who is building a new bridge, had been anchored in the river since around April, said Robert Van Cura, undersheriff of the Rockland County Sheriff's Office. Boat operator Jojo K. John, 35, was arrested. ""We have probable cause to believe that he operated the boat while intoxicated,"" Van Cura said. John was arraigned at an area hospital on one count of first-degree vehicular manslaughter and three counts of second-degree vehicular assault, Van Cura said. More charges are possible, he said. Van Cura said the operator was not the registered owner of the boat, which may have more than one owner. Bond was hospitalized at Westchester Medical Center, said Stewart's stepfather Walter Kosik, who visited him Saturday. ""He was in no condition to talk."" A spokesman for the medical center said Bond was in fair condition. ""She's supposed to be married two weeks from today,"" said Carol Stewart about her daughter. ""It just can't end like this.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. citizen has been charged with alleged involvement in planning last year's terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, the Justice Department said Monday. David Headley of Chicago, Illinois, already faced charges alleging that he planned attacks against a Danish newspaper. Headley, 49, was born in Washington, D.C. The Justice Department alleges he helped plan the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which killed 160 people, including six Americans. The Justice Department said Headley attended terrorism training camps in Pakistan and conspired with members of the group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba to carry out attacks in Denmark and India. The United States considers Lashkar-e-Tayyiba a foreign terrorist organization. The department said Headley was charged in Chicago with six counts of conspiracy to bomb locations in India and to murder and maim persons in India and Denmark, and six counts of aiding and abetting the murder of U.S. citizens in India. He has agreed to cooperate with authorities investigating both terror plots, lawyers involved in the case said. At the time of his October 3 arrest in Chicago, he was on his way back to India to plan a second attack, a source close to the investigation said. He remains in federal custody, with no date set for his arraignment, the Justice Department said. Headley's attorney, John T. Theis, said he has read the additional charges but said he would not comment ""while we have the case under review."" No formal plea has been offered to either these charges or the previous ones, he said. Asked whether his client is cooperating, Theis said, ""At this time, we will only say I don't disagree with the statements made by the U.S. attorney regarding my client's involvement in the investigation."" A retired major in the Pakistani military, Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed, also was charged with conspiracy in planning to attack the newspaper in Denmark. So was Tahawwur Hussain Rana, whom U.S. authorities identify as a Pakistani native and Canadian citizen who lives mainly in Chicago. Headley said he worked for First World Immigration Services, a company owned by Rana, though authorities have said in court papers that surveillance showed that he ""performs few services"" for the company. Kia Scherr -- whose husband, Alan, and 13-year-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in the Mumbai attacks -- welcomed the developments in the case. ""Though my loss still causes me much grief, I am grateful for the support of the FBI, who called me personally and informed me of the news,"" she said. ""My hope is that Headley cooperates fully and discloses all information to aid in the investigation ...""

"(CNN) -- Nobody likes to pay taxes, so can you blame the good folks at Goldman Sachs & Co. for doing what they could to avoid the higher rates that kicked in on January 1? While the rest of us were donning our party clothes on New Year's Eve, the legal worker bees at Goldman were pushing the send button on 10 regulatory filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. By the time the ball dropped in Times Square, regulators had been notified that $65 million in Goldman stock had been granted a month early, helping a cluster of powerful multimillionaire executives trim their tax tab. Among the 10 who shared that $65 million, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar wound up with $8.4 million apiece in Goldman stock. Blankfein's compensation in 2011 was $16.2 million. Cohn and Viniar that year made $15.8 million. Even Gordon Gekko would be impressed to see that bosses making that much money were able to catch a tax break for a couple hundred thousand. The 10 executives who skirted 2013's higher rates were not the only Goldmanites who benefited from the ""accelerated"" vesting. Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, acknowledged there was ""a group larger than"" the 10 but declined to say how many. DuVally would not comment on who made the decision to grant the shares early. The shrewd Goldman move is hardly unique among rich business executives or even 99 percenters of more modest means. It was no secret that higher taxes were coming this year, and taxpayers of all shapes and sizes did what they could to ensure that ""tax events"" would occur in 2012. Even environmental activist and Nobel Prize winner Al Gore tried, albeit without success, to unload his Current TV to Al Jazeera before the new year dawned. What makes the Goldman move distasteful is that it wasn't even two months ago that CEO Blankfein was mouthing off in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he endorsed tax increases ""especially for the wealthiest"" -- along with a plug to cut entitlements to all you freeloaders out there. If you're pushing the position that the rich should pay more to help fix the deficit, it doesn't quite follow to employ a tax dodge, says Dennis Kelleher, president of the Washington-based public interest group Better Markets Inc. ""Goldman's quickie year-end tax shenanigans deprived the government of what it otherwise would get,"" he says. ""So they either cause the debt to go up, or cause others to pay more by the taxes they are avoiding."" DuVally, the Goldman spokesman, declined to comment when I asked whether it was inconsistent for Goldman to make a move for its executives to avoid taxes after Blankfein endorsed increases for the wealthy. I've got to hand it to Goldman. The firm is a master of the ""have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too"" brand of politics and public relations. One minute, Goldman is cranking out press releases about its devotion to women entrepreneurs in its philanthropic ""10,000 women"" program. The next, it is announcing its annual list of new partners that includes a paltry 10 women but 60 men. Goldman was a victim on the defensive when Greg Smith, a former employee, wrote a New York Times op-ed on March 14, blasting the firm for having ""morally bankrupt people"" who needed to be weeded out. You could almost feel sorry for poor Goldman, which shipped out a memo reminding employees that their estimable employer had been named one of the best places to work in the United Kingdom only weeks before the London-based Smith's ""Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs"" essay. By the time Smith published a book seven months later, the firm had turned ruthless revenge-seeker, even sharing parts of Smith's self-evaluations with the media. A ""best place to work?"" Really? Careful what you say in the press -- and in your HR file -- if you get your paycheck from a Goldman-style operation. The brouhaha over Smith's op-ed and book stirred up debate of the ""What did you expect of an investment bank operating in capitalistic society?"" type. Fair enough. Banks are not in the philanthropy business -- even if they spend as much time as Goldman does talking about its good deeds and famous ""business principles."" (""Our clients always come first"" is famously No. 1 on the list.) At Goldman and other ""too big to fail"" banks, though, employees walk through the doors each morning knowing that the rest of us will be forced to bail them out again should another crisis ensue. We taxpayers provide the insurance policy that they enjoy without ever sending us premiums. In October of 2008, Goldman got $10 billion in taxpayer money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which it ultimately paid back. Blankfein, like other bank CEOs, would later make the case that Goldman wasn't ""relying on"" that government help. But leaf through the tomes of some of the regulators who lived through the crisis, and you start to wonder whether our tax-dodging heroes might be out of jobs today if the public hadn't fronted a bailout. From ""Bull by the Horns,"" by former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman Sheila Bair: Goldman and Morgan Stanley were ""teetering on the edge"" in the fall of 2008. From ""Bailout: An Inside Account of how Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street,"" by Neil Barofsky, former special inspector general to oversee the Troubled Assets Relief Program: Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke ""confided that he believed that Goldman Sachs would have been the next to go"" after Morgan Stanley. We need to change the conversation here. Goldman and its too-big-to-fail brethren are banks that accepted welfare and are in debt to U.S. taxpayers for averting disaster. This hasn't been about hard-nosed capitalism since those first TARP wire transfers made their way into Goldman Sachs' coffers. As for the bank's recent tax-reduction maneuver, it's another reminder that Goldman's management is either clueless about how bad it looks or doesn't care. Sometimes bad PR is a just a cost of doing business. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Susan Antilla.","Goldman Sachs granted $65 million in stock to execs before new tax rates began .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy minesweeper remained stuck in a reef teeming with endangered marine life off the Philippines on Sunday, prompting an American commander to apologize and promise stepped-up efforts to prevent further damage. The USS Guardian ran aground early Thursday in the Tubbataha Reef, about 80 miles east-southeast of Palawan Island in the Sulu Sea, the U.S. Navy reported. All 79 sailors were evacuated from the 224-foot ship. Hazardous weather and rough seas have hindered efforts to survey the empty Guardian and the surrounding area, though the Navy acknowledges damage to the reef. ""As a protector of the sea and a sailor myself, I greatly regret any damage this incident has caused the Tubbataha Reef,"" said Vice Adm. Scott Swift, the U.S. 7th Fleet commander, in a report posted Sunday on a Navy website. ""We know the significance of the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park and its importance as a World Heritage Site. Its protection is vital, and we take seriously our obligations to protect and preserve the maritime environment."" The Guardian, an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship based in Japan, was heading from Subic Bay to its next port call in Indonesia when it struck the reef's south atoll, the Navy said. The incident remains under investigation. Initial efforts to free the ship failed and its crew was transferred by small boats to other U.S. ships. The U.S. Navy reported no signs of oil slicks in the area. Philippine Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Gregory Favic -- in a report on the official Philippines News Agency (PNA) -- similarly indicated no evidence of oil. Three Philippine naval ships were in the area, along with a number of U.S. ships, according to Sunday's PNA report. The U.S. Navy will step up efforts on Monday when Rear Adm. Thomas Carney takes over as on-site commander on the destroyer USS Mustin. The focus is ""preventing any further environmental damage to the reef and surrounding marine environment,"" according to the Navy report. Home to a vast array of sea, air and land creatures, as well as sizable lagoons and two coral islands, Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site. About 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there, as can whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and one of the last surviving colonies of breeding seabirds in the region, according to UNESCO. CNN's Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","A U.S. Navy minesweeper got stuck Thursday in a sensitive reef off the Philippines .

"Washington (CNN) -- By the time President Barack Obama walked into a packed auditorium at the White House Monday, his economic message for the day had already been eclipsed by the unfolding tragedy at the Washington Navy Yard. And that was before the city's mayor announced that 12 people and the gunman had been shot dead. As the White House shifted again into disaster-response mode, the president's already-full plate got a lot fuller. And while the executive branch is more than capable of keeping multiple balls in the air, the topics Obama has been looking to push for months are again receding into the background. Here are five things Obama thought he'd spend his Monday doing: . 1 -- The financial crisis, five years later . On September 15, 2008, that financial services giant Lehman Brothers filed for what would become the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history -- launching an economic spiral that saw the unemployment rate spike, home prices plummet and the auto industry sink into insolvency. On Monday, the president planned to mark the five-year anniversary of the financial crisis with a robust accounting of his own achievements in bringing the economy back from the brink and to warn congressional Republicans not to risk another downturn by playing politics with the country's finances. ""At the moment, Republicans in Congress don't seem to be focused on how to grow the economy and build the middle class,"" Obama said at his Monday event, which was pushed back almost an hour as law enforcement officers flooded the Washington Navy Yard in the southeastern part of the city. His economic remarks come just weeks before major financial deadlines, including the end of the federal government's 2013 fiscal year on Sept. 30. Obama must also narrow down his list of potential replacements for Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve, a list that no longer includes Larry Summers, a former adviser who Sunday withdrew his name from consideration. But the economic message Monday came only after Obama noted the shooting that had just taken place across town, offering the now-familiar assurances that the perpetrator of the attack would be held responsible. ""We're going to be investigating thoroughly what happened, as we do so many of these shootings, sadly, that have happened, and do everything that we can to try to prevent them,"" Obama said, before moving on to the latest developments in... 2 -- Syria. The crisis over Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons had occupied the bulk of the president's time during the past two weeks, but on Monday the attack in Washington led his morning meetings. White House officials said Obama was briefed ""several times"" by his top counterterrorism officials on the unfolding Navy Yard situation. At the same time, officials at the United Nations were putting final touches on a long-awaited report that confirmed what many already suspected -- that sarin gas loaded onto rockets was used to kill more than a thousand Syrians in August. The report didn't place blame for the attacks; that didn't stop Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice from asserting in a statement the report ""reinforces our assessment that these attacks were carried out by the Syrian regime."" While a diplomatic solution hammered out over the weekend between the United States and Russia may provide a way to avoid a military strike on Syria, the accord is by no means final. ""We took an important step in that direction towards moving Syria's chemical weapons under international control so they can be destroyed,"" Obama said at his Monday event. ""And we're not there yet, but if properly implemented, this agreement could end the threat these weapons pose, not only to the Syrian people but to the world."" Under the U.S.-Russia plan, Assad has a week to provide a list of his chemical weapons, where they're located and how they were made. But experts aren't certain he'll comply with the demands, leaving open the possibility of American airstrikes against his regime. That's a possibility Obama says he's ready for -- though lawmakers from both parties have shown no renewed willingness to approve military strikes in the country. An Obama administration onslaught to persuade senators and congressmen to vote for strikes was met with skepticism last week. For Congress, the Syria debate was a shift from the battle over the government's finances, which some Republicans are using to harden their opposition to... 3 -- Obamacare. The largest piece of legislation Obama can claim -- 2010's Affordable Care Act -- is only beginning to take effect amid ever-louder cries from Republicans that it's bad for patients, doctors and businesses. A group of GOP lawmakers say they'll oppose any government funding plan that maintains funding for Obamacare, effectively threatening a government shutdown if the law stays in effect. The law's health care exchanges take effect Oct. 1, and the Obama administration has been hurriedly pressing healthy young people to register. Without them, rates on the exchanges will be higher. The rollout of Obamacare hasn't always been smooth, a fact Obama has said should be expected for a large law that enacts major changes to the health insurance landscape. But as the rollout date approaches, polls show that Americans are wildly confused about the law's implications. In one survey, many weren't even sure it was still a law. Obama has deployed a parade of high-profile supporters -- including former President Bill Clinton -- to help convince Americans the law offers them a better deal on health insurance. And on Monday he noted that ""just two weeks from now, millions of Americans who've been locked out of buying health insurance just because they had a pre-existing condition, just because they had been sick or they couldn't afford it, they're finally going to have a chance to buy quality, affordable health care on the private marketplace."" And then there's: . 4 -- Immigration . What seemed like a momentum-fueled bill to overhaul the nation's immigration system was met with a wall of opposition in the House over the summer, and debate hasn't restarted amid the haggling over government funding and the flurry of briefings on Syria's chemical weapons. Obama has strongly urged lawmakers to take up the reform measure, and he said in an interview that aired Sunday the Senate bill would pass if it was put up for a vote in the House. 5 -- Floods out West . It's hurricane season on the East Coast, but the weather disaster over the weekend was playing out thousands of miles away in the Mountain West, where days of heavy rain caused massive flooding that cut off towns and left at least eight people dead. The catastrophe occupied much of the president's time last week; on Thursday he signed a disaster declaration for Colorado, and on Sunday he told Gov. John Hickenlooper in a phone call that he was deploying his emergency management chief to assess the damage.","The shooting at the Washington Navy Yard led President Obama's talk about the economy .
Obama later touted his achievements since the financial crisis started five years ago .
Obama spent the last few weeks addressing the chemical weapons situation in Syria .
Obamacare's rollout, the stalled immigration bill have gotten lost in the shuffle ."
"(CNN) -- At Christmas, the name of Jesus resounds everywhere in homes, churches, in hauntingly gorgeous carols, even casual conversations. Yet Christians didn't settle on December 25 as Christmas day until the fourth century, and this choice probably had something to do with its proximity to the winter solstice or its position as the final day of the Roman Saturnalia. It was in the late third century, in fact, that the Roman emperor Aurelian established this date as a feast day celebrating the birth of the Unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus), so it already had festive and quasi-religious prominence. Now it serves to welcome the infant who became Christ, the Greek word for Messiah. There are probably as many visions of Jesus, and versions, as there are Christians. Many regard him as their savior, the Son of God sent to Earth to save human beings from themselves. Others see him as a great teacher, a healer or rabbi of extraordinary power, a holy man or prophet who proposed a new covenant between heaven and earth. To some, he represents a new world order, an egalitarian society, a preacher of nonviolence who asked us to turn the other cheek. Was he the long-awaited Messiah? The Lamb of God who removes the sin of the world by his self-sacrifice? King of the Jews? Or something less dramatic but still impressive -- an ethical teacher of extraordinary grace and power? My father, a former Roman Catholic, became a Baptist minister, and I grew up with an insider's view of evangelical Christianity. My father read the Bible aloud at breakfast each morning, always in the King James Version. Beginning in December, I listened to the sonorous birth narratives of Luke and Matthew. In the latter, there are Wise Men coming from the East, a mysterious star, the massacre of innocent children by King Herod, and a flight to Egypt by the Holy Family. Belief Blog: The Christmas message of the real St. Nicholas . My father, like me, preferred the gentler Christmas story put forward by Luke: ""And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."" I remember asking my father one day why these two Christmas stories seemed incompatible, at best. Even the lineages put forward by Matthew and Luke have few points of reconciliation. I also wondered why the two other Gospels -- Mark and John -- made no mention of Christmas. Why was there no mention of Christmas anywhere else in the whole of the Bible? Didn't they care? He was a gentle but cautious fellow, my father, with a rock-solid faith. ""It's probably better not to ask difficult questions,"" he said. ""God will, in time, provide the answers. But not now. Not in this life."" He told me simply to enjoy Christmas. That didn't satisfy me, of course. Why should it? I realized that, as St. Paul so elegantly put it, we see only ""through a glass darkly"" while on this earth. But wasn't that too easy? I needed to know more. And I still want to know the truth about this luminous figure, Jesus of Nazareth. Was he really the Son of God? Why was he sent into the world? Do we know anything about him, really? To consider yourself a Christian, must you believe in the Virgin Birth, or that Jesus walked on water, healed the sick, and rose triumphantly from the dead? Does it matter if we take all of this on board in a literal fashion? Isn't this a lovely mythos -- the Greek word for story -- a narrative with symbolic resonance and profound meaning? Christmas by the numbers . Jesus himself seemed unwilling to answer questions about his royal status or divinity. When asked by Pontius Pilate about his status as King of the Jews, he simply replied, ""You say so."" Many in his circle referred to as the Son of God, but this wasn't an especially divine title. Augustus Caesar was called Son of God -- Divi filius -- on Roman coins. Jesus certainly regarded himself as having a filial connection to the person he called, in his native Aramaic, Abba, or Father. But doesn't that only mean he felt like a son before this personified spirit? He was also called the Son of Man, reaching back to an ancient Hebraic phrase, which had rather humbling connotations. (It was in the Book of Daniel that a visionary figure called the Son of Man came into view, in apocalyptic terms). All attempts to classify Jesus seem hopelessly inadequate. As I've grown older, I appreciate more than ever before the strength of this figure, Jesus, who emerges in the four canonical Gospels, and the Gnostic gospels, as a witty, intelligent, complex, inspiring, and often contradictory person. He was a religious genius who grew up on the Silk Road in ancient Palestine, on that magical trade route connecting East and West. From the West he acquired an understanding of Greek metaphysics, with its remarkable formulation of body and soul. From the East came the winds of mysticism, a sense of self-transformation based on the loss of selfhood, with enlightenment the ultimate goal. Jesus brings East and West together, focusing on his key idea -- that of a gradually realizing kingdom, a mystical space beyond time, though it requires time in order to root and grow. As he told someone who asked where this lofty kingdom lay: ""The kingdom of God is within you."" Photos: Santas over the years . Too many Christians regard their religion as a list of boxes that need checking. To belong, you must subscribe to a particular set of beliefs. It's dogma, pure and simple. I suspect that Jesus himself would have been startled to think that, many centuries after his death, more than 2 billion people would celebrate his coming into the world, find his message of a gradually realizing kingdom an inspiring challenge, worthy of serious pursuit, devotion and emulation. Jesus was a real person who lived in time, and his life has huge mythical resonance with the power to change hearts and minds. I believe that firmly. At this stage of my life -- a senior citizen, as they say politely -- I'm also quite happy to believe in miracles, assuming that the membrane between life and death is paper thin. All Christian thinking is, however, about resurrection. It's about moving beyond our small selves, shifting away from our ego-drenched understanding of reality. The way of Jesus involves engagement with his (often difficult) teachings as well as looking for those unspeakably beautiful moments in time when, for just a few seconds perhaps, we apprehend the timeless moment in time. Life mostly offers, as T.S. Eliot suggests in ""Little Gidding,"" ""only hints and guesses, / Hints followed by guesses."" The rest is ""prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.","Jay Parini: There are as many visions of Jesus, and versions, as there are Christians .

"Athens (CNN) -- Creditors agreed to a plan to restructure Greek government bonds, government officials said Friday, marking a vital move to the financial future of the country. The monumental deal means Greece has cleared its final hurdle to qualify for the â‚¬130 billion bailout program from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. More than 85% of private bondholders agreed to the deal, Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in a statement. The agreement, called the private-sector involvement, gives bondholders unattractive terms, experts have said. Investors who own Greek bonds could now see losses of up to 75%. But not doing the agreement could have meant that Greece would not qualify for more bailout money and could face default. Now that the deal is accepted, European finance officials could approve the final portion of Greece's bailout as early as Friday. ""I wish to express my appreciation to all of our creditors who have supported our ambitious program of reform and adjustment, and who have shared the sacrifices of the Greek people in this historic endeavor,"" Venizelos said. The Institute of International Finance, the Washington, D.C.-based industry group that represented the private-sector creditors, applauded the plan. ""The very strong and positive result provides a major opportunity now for Greece to move ahead with its economic reform program,"" the group said in a statement.","More than 85% of private bondholders agree to the deal .

"(EW.com) -- ""Sleepy Hollow"" gives the Headless Horseman a shotgun, and the shotgun appears to fire explosive rounds. In the first half hour, three people get their heads cut off. And you know how throughout American history there have been witch trials, which historians retroactively consider the result of mass hysteria? Turns out all those witches were actually witches. None of these things even comes close to being the kookiest part of the series premiere of ""Sleepy Hollow,"" a crazypants â€” and entertaining, if you squint â€” hour of television. Our critic Jeff Jensen has already weighed in with a look at some of the deeper resonances in the show. The goofy, intriguing, timely allegory that is Fox's 'Sleepy Hollow' What follows is a handy primer for the show's insanity: . The episode starts in the middle of a Revolutionary War battle, which you have to admit is not a common starting place for TV shows. Nor, for that matter, can I think of any other TV show in history that has suddenly introduced an invulnerable British soldier wearing an ""Eyes Wide Shut"" mask. And certainly, it's rare for the protagonist of a TV show to chop off someone's head in the first three minutes of his show. We don't really know who this guy is yet, except that obviously we do because the title of the show is Sleepy Hollow and we all remember Disney's Ichabod Crane song. After being knocked out and losing a lot of blood during his fight with the British Masked Horseman, Ichabod Crane suddenly wakes up inside of a cave covered in weird cave stuff. When he wakes up, a couple of glass jars break. One of them contains a snake, and one of them contains a frog. This will probably be important later, unless it's not. Fox orders 'Sleepy Hollow' pilot from 'Star Trek' team . Ichabod immediately runs into the middle of a road and almost gets hit by not one, but two terribly animated digital cars. The second one actually clips him. Actor Tom Mison kind of sells it. So, to recap, in the first five minutes, the protagonist of ""Sleepy Hollow"" has decapitated a Redcoat, flash-forwarded 250 years in history, woken up in a cave, and been hit by a car. Elsewhere in Sleepy Hollow, we meet Clancy Brown, who's basically playing the same character Jeff Fahey played on the first episode of ""Under the Dome."" He fires 12 rounds of ammunition at the Headless Horseman and gets his head chopped off. In one of the night's many flashbacks, we see Ichabod in a Revolutionary War-era infirmary. He's hanging out with his wife, who is a nurse, and also a priest who appears to be immortal. But none of that is important right now! What is important is that they put a Bible on Ichabod's body, and in the present day, Ichabod finds it and flips right to the Book of Revelation and decides that the Headless Horseman is the First Horseman of the Apocalypse. And they keep on reading Revelations throughout the episode to get clues about stuff. So basically, the Book of Revelation is to ""Sleepy Hollow"" as Edgar Allen Poe is to ""The Following."" So excited for the ""Seven Trumpets"" musical episode! Also, George Washington is in this TV show. Although he only appears in flashbacks that are shot like re-enactments on ""Unsolved Mysteries."" Anyhow, all you have to know is that the pilot of ""Sleepy Hollow"" features the line ""The answers are in Washington's Bible!"" So it's basically ""National Treasure"" meets ""Assassin's Creed 3"" meets ""Picket Fences."" Remember that immortal priest I mentioned? Turns out that he's telekinetic or whatever! He tries to hold off the Headless Horseman using his brain to control chains, but the Horseman cuts through them with his axe, which I should mention is heated to 500 degrees. This priest also gets decapitated. Trailers for the new Fox Fall 2013 TV shows . We should mention Ichabod's new partner, Abbie. When we meet her, she initially seems like an everywoman police officer. She is also the source of most of the pilot's self-mocking exposition, including the immortal line, ""So the killer is the First Horseman of the Apocalypse, and the proof is a Bible we found in a cave."" But it turns out that she has a crazy history. When she was young, she and her sister were wandering through the forest, when suddenly they saw four white trees, which represent the Four Horseman probably, because numbers. They also saw a strange creature. Then they blacked out. (It turns out that Clancy Brown was investigating this and many other mysteries before he died, and basically ""Sleepy Hollow"" is ""Twin Peaks"" plus ""Cabot Cove."") It also turns out that Ichabod Crane's wife is a witch who is currently residing in some weird dimension in the forest that looks like Fairyland in ""True Blood."" She's a good witch, though, and she's trying to stop the apocalypse, but there's a group of bad witches who are trying to cause the apocalypse. Somewhere, the decapitated head of Washington Irving is rolling his eyes. Right about the time that the Headless Horseman starts firing a shotgun, you're probably thinking to yourself, ""Certainly the only thing sillier than this would be that the shotgun appears to be shooting fireworks."" Gentlemen, your chariot has arrived. The fireworks don't hit anyone, because this is broadcast TV and you can't show anyone getting shot, although you can show three decapitations. John Cho appears in the pilot episode as a duplicitous cop who is a witch or whatever, and is mostly just there to remind you how much you liked John Cho's character arc in ""FlashForward."" He gets killed by some kind of strange creature who appears in the mirror and is basically the devil, probably. Also, the Headless Horseman's Horse has red eyes. Spooky! So there's no way the show can possibly maintain this momentum week-to-week, unless at the end of episode 4, America launches its nuclear arsenal at the Moon in order to destroy an attacking horde of bat-people. But I would watch the heck out of that show. What did you think of the Sleepy Hollow premiere, fellow viewers? See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- ""A fashion show's soundtrack is just as important as the venue, the seating and the production,"" said Alexander Wang, the 29-year-old designer of his own label. Wang, who is also the new creative director of European fashion house Balenciaga, said music is an integral part of how he is inspired. When he presented his edgy fall 2013 looks at the historic Cunard Building in Manhattan's financial district, Wang juxtaposed the traditional space and its nostalgic feel with a soundtrack that he called ""very industrial, very kind of Berlin underground."" Music was so important to Marcus Wainwright and David Neville's rag & bone label that they commissioned Radiohead front man Thom Yorke and producer Nigel Godrich to create a custom track for their show. Meanwhile, Carolina Herrera collaborated with composer and pianist Tom Hodge on an original score for her fashion show. Hodge, Herrera and producer Javier Peral worked with the London Contemporary Orchestra at the famed Abbey Road Studios in London last fall to create ""Capriccio for Carolina,"" a score inspired by Beethoven's Kreutzer Violin Sonata. When the lights dimmed at Michael Kors' runway show, the music swelled and the models appeared on the catwalk in vivid orange, bright blue and taxicab yellow. But Kors, who compares fashion shows to Broadway productions, said it is the music that brings it all to life. ""This show we are using a fabulous new singer named Willy Moon. It's a little '50s, a little '80s, a little modern."" The collection, which Kors calls ""urban athleticism,"" focused on movement and speed, and was enhanced by Moon's soundtrack. Plus, Kors said the singer ""is superstylish and fun and energetic and it kind of sets the mood."" Rebecca Taylor agrees.

"(CNN) -- Inadequate security measures and an unprepared military are two factors that allowed a group of Islamists to attack and take hostages at a gas field in Algeria in January, a report says. The report by Statoil, whose employees were among those taken hostage, says the companies that ran the gas field never anticipated a scenario where a large force of attackers hit the facility. The companies were too dependent on the Algerian military, which was ""not able to detect or prevent the attackers from reaching the site,"" the report says. At least 37 hostages were killed in the four-day ordeal. The plant is run by In Amenas Gas, a joint venture between oil giant BP, Statoil, and Sonatrach. Among the victims were five Statoil employees, which led the company to conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the attack. ""The terror attack against In Amenas was an unprecedented attack,"" lead investigator Torgeir Hagen said in a statement. ""It clearly demonstrates that also companies like Statoil today face serious security threats."" Algeria attack changes terror landscape in North Africa . The investigation team concluded that a different response to the attack would not have changed the outcome. But the lesson is that the site was not designed with security measures that would stop or slow an attack on that scale, the report says. The militant siege caught the world's attention as it ensnared citizens from several nations and dragged on for days. Algerian authorities said they believe the attack was revenge for allowing France to use Algerian airspace for an offensive against Islamist militants in neighboring Mali. A group led by the jihadist commander known as ""Mr. Marlboro,"" Moktar Belmoktar, was responsible for the deadly attack. The plant in southern Algeria employed about 790 people, including 134 foreign workers. Algeria hostage crisis shows jihadists on rise .","An Algerian gas field was attacked in January .

"(CNN) -- Marilyn Edge was supposed to turn over her son and daughter to her ex-husband in Georgia. Instead, police allege, she fled with the children to Southern California and killed them. On Saturday night, the bodies of the children -- Jaelen, 13, and Faith, 10 -- were found in a hotel in Santa Ana, California. Edge, 42, was apprehended Saturday night after apparently trying to commit suicide by crashing her car at a Home Depot parking lot in a nearby town, police said. Authorities in Orange County have charged Edge with the children's murder. She was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday in Santa Ana to enter a plea to the charges but her arraignment was delayed -- with her attorney agreeing to the delay -- until October 25. Her ex-husband, Mark Edge, is hospitalized at the VA hospital in Decatur, Georgia, his attorney Marian Weeks said. The former couple had been fighting a years-long custody battle over the children. Weeks told CNN affiliate WSB that Marilyn Edge had abruptly left court last week after a judge's custody ruling did not go in her favor. Under the order, she was meant to hand the two children over to her ex-husband at Cobb County Police Headquarters in Georgia. ""When Judge Leonard was giving his order on Wednesday afternoon, she got up and left the courtroom in the middle of it, so that was the ultimate message to Judge Leonard: 'I'm not going to listen to what you have to say.'"" said Weeks. Weeks said she expressed suspicions to her client that Marilyn Edge might flee. ""I'd even said to him I thought she'd take the kids to California because she'd lived in California in the past,"" she said. ""But neither of us thought she'd kill the children."" Marilyn Edge, from Scottsdale, Arizona, has been charged with two felony counts of special circumstance murder in the deaths of the two children, the Orange County District Attorney said. If convicted, she faces a minimum sentence of life in state prison without the possibility of parole. The special circumstances cited by prosecutors include committing multiple murders and murder by poisoning. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","NEW: Arraignment is postponed until October for Marilyn Edge, facing felony murder charges .

"(CNN) -- The psychiatrist treating the accused Colorado movie theater gunman was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could potentially be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH reported Wednesday, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. The psychiatrist's concerns surfaced in early June, nearly six weeks before the July 20 killings inside a movie theater in Aurora, sources told the Denver station. Twelve people were killed and 58 wounded when the gunman opened fire during a screening of the new Batman film. James Holmes, 24, was charged Monday with murder and attempted murder in the case; he also faces two weapons charges. Why Holmes was charged in 'unusual' way . A court document filed Friday revealed Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton before the attack. Sources told KMGH that Fenton contacted several members of a ""behavioral evaluation and threat assessment"" team to say Holmes could potentially be a danger to others, the station reported. The ""BETA"" team consists of ""key"" staff members from various university departments who have specific expertise in dealing with assessing potential threats on campus, the school says on its website. Holmes was a doctoral student at the university's Anschutz Medical Campus until June, when he withdrew from the program.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A roadside bomb killed a top Pakistani general Sunday, just a day after officials announced plans to withdraw troops from a war-ravaged region near the border with Afghanistan. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed Maj. Gen. Sanaullah Khan, the commanding officer in Swat Valley. Two other officers were also killed, army officials said. For years, troops have clashed with Taliban militants in Swat, which drew global attention last year when militants there shot teenager Malala Yousafzai point-blank in the head and neck after she defied the Taliban's ban against girls in school. The Pakistani army has reclaimed control of the Swat Valley, where the Taliban held significant sway for years. But Sunday's attack was a troubling reminder of the region's volatility even as officials consider pulling out troops. The roadside bombing occurred in the Upper Dir district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northern Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. On Saturday officials in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa announced for a ""phased withdrawal"" of troops from Upper Dir, Lower Dir and Swat. And last week the Pakistani government announced plans to pursue renewed peace talks with Taliban militants. Pakistani leaders push for Taliban talks . But a Taliban spokesman said Sunday that there is no ceasefire with the Pakistani government, warning that such attacks will continue. ""We have killed them,"" Pakistani Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said, ""as they are killing us.""

"(CNN) -- A Washington man is facing federal child pornography charges after allegedly recording and posting online the sexual assault of an 8-year-old girl at an elementary school where he was once the PTA president. Federal prosecutors say David M. Navarro, 37, shot a cellphone video of the girl performing oral sex at Belfair Elementary School -- and shared it on the web. Court documents don't say whether Navarro was the man in the video. At the time of the incident, Navarro was the president of Belfair's parent-teacher association. Navarro faces multiple charges, including the production, ownership, and distribution of child pornography. Court documents reveal Navarro was arrested and charged in San Diego in 2009 for ""lewd and lascivious acts with a child"" as well as ""indecent exposure,"" but the charges were dismissed due to a lack of evidence. Police: Florida man linked to up to 1 million child porn videos, images . North Mason School District Superintendent David Peterson issued a statement Wednesday, describing Navarro as a ""school volunteer"" who passed a ""State Patrol"" background check in 2011. He also said he has been in contact with the lead FBI investigators, saying ""the FBI informed us today that this is not something the school could reasonably have prevented."" Peterson assured parents that the North Mason School District ""takes the responsibility of the safety and welfare of all students extremely seriously."" U.S. Federal authorities were tipped off to the information by investigators in Denmark and Australia, who came across a ""large number of files"" of suspected child pornography, which had been appearing on sites across the globe. Teachers among 50 arrested in child sex sting . Upon closer inspection, investigators discovered a GPS stamp in one of the videos, with the coordinates matching those of Belfair Elementary School. Investigators then alerted the FBI, who arrested Navarro four days later. Court documents indicate authorities were worried that the assaults were ongoing. An FBI special agent, submitting a letter to the court, alleges that Navarro's e-mail account was linked to an ""account on a website known by law enforcement to post . . . child pornography."" The agent said Navarro appears to have posted at least 14 photos to the website, including one of the girl who appears in the video. Authorities believe Navarro created at least six videos in which the 8-year-old girl was sexually assaulted. U.S. investigators also searched Navarro's Belfair home Friday, and seized two pairs of boxer shorts, at least 10 computers, and an iPhone 5, which they suspect was used to make the illegal videos. Navarro is currently jailed, pending a detention hearing, which is scheduled for Thursday at a federal courthouse in Tacoma, Washington.

"(CNN) -- A government audit on Navy security found that the Navy Yard and other installations may have increased security risks in an effort to reduce costs, a federal source told CNN. ""Navy installations command attempted to reduce access control costs,"" according to a soon-to-be-released report from the Department of Defense Inspector General. The source read CNN portions of the report. ""As a result, at least 52 convicted felons received routine unauthorized installation access, placing military personnel at increased security risk."" The audit covered ""a variety"" of military installations, of which Navy Yard was one, according to the federal source with access to the report. The source shared the information on the condition of anonymity because the report has not yet been officially released. In the wake of the shooting on Monday, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, a member of the Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to the Pentagon inspector general demanding he brief members of Congress on the Navy security audit. What is security like at the Navy Yard? ""It is my understanding that the IG report indicates the Navy may have implemented an unproven system in order to cut costs,"" read the letter, first obtained by CNN. ""I also learned that potentially numerous felons may have been able to gain restricted access to several military installations across the country due to insufficient background checks, increasing the risk to our military personnel and civilian employees."" According to a memo announcing the launch of the audit posted on the Department of Defense Inspector General website, the investigation began in September 2012. ""Our objective is to determine whether the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS) is mitigating access control risks to Navy installations. We will consider suggestions from management on additional or revised objectives,"" the memo said. In August 2013, the inspector general posted an update saying the report would be published ""within the next 30 days.""","Audit to be released on security at Navy Yard, other installations .

"Paris (CNN) -- A French appeals court on Wednesday rejected a Rwandan request to extradite the widow of former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose assassination sparked the 1994 genocide. Lawyer Philippe Meilhac said his client, former first lady Agathe Habyarimana, was ""relieved"" and ""very satisfied"" with the court's decision. ""This is a very delicate case, as it can also impact relations between France and Rwanda, so this decision is important and in many ways symbolic,"" Meilhac said. Habyarimana still faces a civil suit dating from 2007, when a French Rwandan rights collective accused her of being involved in the genocide, Meilhac said. Habyarimana has asked to be heard by a judge but is still waiting to be summoned, he said. She faces a Rwandan warrant on genocide charges that include crimes against humanity, specifically murder and extermination; creation of a criminal gang, namely the Hutu militias; and aiding and abetting the killings perpetrated by soldiers in violation of the Geneva Conventions, John Bosco Mutangana, the head of Rwanda's Genocide Fugitives Tracking Unit, said last year. Habyarimana left Rwanda for France soon after the violence broke out. Meilhac said there have been roughly 10 extradition requests during her 15 years in France. Her husband, the former president, was killed in April 1994 when his plane was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The mass killings began hours later, and by the time they ended 100 days later, 800,000 people had been killed. Most were members of the country's Tutsi minority, killed by members of the Hutu majority. The circumstances surrounding the former president's death remain a mystery. He was a Hutu, and speculation immediately fell on Tutsis -- but some have also speculated that Hutus themselves may have shot down the plane to provide cover for the ensuing genocide. Top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide have been tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried by local communities in ""gacaca"" courts, which allow survivors to confront their attackers. Some human rights organizations have criticized the gacaca courts for falling short on delivering justice. Habyarimana has no residency permit, having been refused legal status by the French prefecture. She has appealed that decision and is awaiting a ruling from the Versailles administration court in the next few weeks, Meilhac said. ""The administration court should look to the appeals court as an example,"" he said. ""The case against my client is empty, and she deserves to be granted a residency permit.""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A new North Korean propaganda video shows images of what appears to be an imagined missile attack on U.S. government buildings in Washington, including the White House and the Capitol. The roughly 4-minute video was posted Monday on the YouTube channel of the North Korean government website Uriminzokkiri. It carries a montage of clips of different weapons, including artillery guns firing and large missiles on display at military parades. Just before the three-minute mark, it cuts to footage of the White House in an electronic sight's crosshairs, and then a simulated explosion of the Capitol's dome. At the same time, the voice narrating the video says, ""The White House has been captured in the view of our long-range missile, and the capital of war is within the range of our atomic bomb."" Analysts say that North Korea is still years away from being able to target nuclear missiles at the United States. U.S. lawmaker questions North Korean leader's 'stability' But the video's release comes amid spiking tensions between Pyongyang and Washington after the U.N. Security Council voted to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea following its latest nuclear test last month. In a slew of angry rhetoric in response to the U.N. vote, North Korea has threatened to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the United States and South Korea and said it was nullifying the armistice agreement that stopped the Korean War in 1953. Although U.S. officials say they don't believe North Korea is in a position to strike the United States at the moment, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel last week announced plans to deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast as part of efforts to enhance the nation's ability to defend itself from attack. This isn't the first time a North Korean propaganda video has evoked the prospect of an attack on the United States. A video posted on YouTube last month, before the North carried out its most recent underground nuclear test, depicted a city resembling New York with its skyscrapers on fire. That video was subsequently removed after the video game maker Activision said those scenes had been lifted from its top-selling game ""Call of Duty.""

"New York (CNN) -- You've tried to, but so far, your foray into social media marketing is not adding to sales, just to headaches. How will Twitter sell sweets at your ice cream parlor? How will Facebook fill your restaurant or sell your handmade frocks? I've heard the complaint from small business owners and professionals a million times: ""How can I monetize social media?"" Mitch Goldstone has owned a photo-developing shop in Irvine, California, since 1990. He used to develop 24-exposure film cartridges. Today he takes those shoe boxes of photos under your bed and scans them so you can use them online. Scanmyphoto.com has 10,600 followers on Twitter and Goldstone has sent 32,000 tweets. He doesn't just self-promote. He shares links and product reviews, and blends into a running conversation online about all things photo. His presence on Twitter and Facebook has taken his Irvine photo shop international. He scans photos from three miles away in Irvine to thousands of miles away in Australia. ""If you're not into social media social networking you will be out of business. I'm going to repeat that: You will be out of business if you don't tweet, use Facebook, and social media today,"" Goldstone says. Ido Leffler is the co-founder of natural beauty brand ""Yes To..."" When an expensive traditional print marketing campaign fell flat, he and his partner turned to social media to find the face to their product. Their Facebook campaign attracted 150,000 fans and sales doubled in six months. Social media, in his view, is an equalizer. Anyone can use it, and using it well means new customers. ""Today you don't have to spend any money at all to set up a Facebook fan page. You don't need a huge marketing fund to set up a Twitter account. You need zero,"" Leffler says. Here are some dos and don'ts from accomplished users of social media: . 'It just takes too much time and doesn't add to sales' Wrong attitude. You can't afford not to. An online presence is like a phone number: Your customers expect it and are looking for you online. Listen to your customers . Listen to what your customers are saying about your business through social media. Answer them individually if you can. Word of mouth, good and bad, can have a powerful effect on sales. If it's bad, ask your customers how you can do better. Be nimble . In California, a group of hip food vendor trucks tweet their location each day so office workers can pop in. In New York, a brutal snowstorm last February meant the hit show ""Mamma Mia"" would be empty on Broadway. The theater tweeted discount tickets for the brave Manhattanites who could walk through the snow, and the house filled. Watch your competitors . You can get great ideas by watching how others in your industry are using social media. A 'tap on the shoulder' Comedian Hal Sparks, who uses social media to listen to his fans and promote his appearances, suggests thinking of a tweet as ""a tap on the shoulder."" More than self-promotion . Customers respond to well-timed discounts and coupons, but free advice and interesting links also get attention. Cultivate a consistent online persona . ""Social media is a great place to be authentic and let your customers know who you are and tell your story,"" says Mike Hofman, deputy editor, Inc. Magazine. Astringent, corporate sounding prose won't get you very far. People who respond to social media move fast, are bright and want clever and succinct. Take it seriously . Designate who in the business will be the online voice and keep it consistent. Some small business owners designate a junior, tech-savvy employee. While that can sometimes work, don't just designate and forget it. ""That can be a problem because do you really want your intern getting your brand message out there and being sort of the arbiter of who you are in the wider commercial world?"" says Inc's Hofman. CNN producer Joanna Digeronimo contributed to this report.","Small businesses can't afford to ignore marketing potential of Facebook and Twitter .

"Cairo (CNN) -- He was once a powerful symbol of autocracy in the Arab world, but Wednesday, a frail Hosni Mubarak was wheeled into a Cairo courtroom cage to face trial for allegedly ordering the killing of anti-government protesters. Dressed in a white prison uniform, Mubarak, 83, was placed in a mesh and iron cage, a standard procedure in Egyptian criminal trials. The former leader, who also faces charges of corruption, peered between the bars, identified himself and denied any culpability. ""All the things that have been said are not true,"" he said. It was a jaw-dropping moment, leaving many incredulous at the sight of the former dictator stripped of his power, the first of the targets of this year's Arab Spring to face justice. If convicted, Mubarak could be punished with death. Arab media described it as the ""trial of the century."" People all over the region were glued to televisions and radios for news of the proceedings. It garnered an array of reactions from the Egyptian people as other embattled leaders in the region -- among them Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, Syria's Bashar al-Assad and Yemen's Ali Abdullah Saleh -- watched closely the fate of one of their own. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, deposed before Mubarak in January, fled to Saudi Arabia and was tried in absentia. ""Every dictator in the region is watching this in total fear, thinking he could be next,"" said Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy. ""And all the citizens in the region, ordinary people in the Arab or Middle East or North Africa, are thinking 'we wish we could put our tyrants on trial.'"" Mubarak, his much despised interior minister, Habib El Adly, and six of the latter's assistants face trial on the same charges. Also facing charges are Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa. Mubarak will return to court August 15, when his trial resumes. Legal proceedings will continue Friday when El Adly appears before the judge. Seeing the once Pharoah-like Mubarak reduced to a crippled man in a cage could garner some sympathy for him, said Barak Barfi, a researcher with the New America Foundation. Mubarak arrived in Cairo after a short trip from his hospital in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh aboard a medically equipped military aircraft. A white helicopter took him to the police academy on the outskirts of Cairo where the proceedings were held. Opponents and supporters gathered at dawn to await the trial of the strongman who ruled Egypt for three decades. As the helicopter hovered before landing at the police academy, the crowd went wild. Some darted in its direction and clapped. Mubarak's trial represents vindication for Egyptians who suffered under his rule and, more recently, those who lost loved ones who protested on the streets for his ouster. Many had awaited eagerly for Mubarak's moment of humiliation. About 840 people died and more than 6,000 were wounded in the 18 days of uprising that toppled Mubarak, according to Amnesty International. A police officer accused of indiscriminately shooting protesters has been sentenced to death in absentia. ""Thirty years of corruption, at least we can see justice is taking place,"" said a woman outside the police academy who did not want to be named. ""I don't know how Mubarak sleeps, when he was responsible for 80 million people and he did not do his job."" But not all were so outwardly against Mubarak. Supporters outside the trial venue waved flags and photos of the ousted leader. They, along with his foes, stood riveted to a big screen set up outside the venue to broadcast the trial. The tension ran high and at one point gunfire erupted as supporters and opponents chased one another, hurling rocks and bottles. Several people were carried away in ambulances. ""How is the army letting this happen? Where is the unprecedented security they promised?"" said Nevein Rashed after she ducked behind a van. When the brief clashes subsided, riot police stood watch as dozens of Mubarak supporters chanted. They wore T-shirts that read: ""I am Egyptian, I will not insult my president."" ""Mubarak is a symbol of Egypt,"" said Entessar Ahmed, 14, who was outside the police academy. ""If there were 30 years of corruption during his time, then every Egyptian should be sentenced because they let it happen."" Others welcomed the former leader's trial, but don't think anything will come of it. ""I believe that he will not be sent to jail. He will find a way to leave the country in one month,"" said Basma Nasr, 20. ""I don't expect any verdict. I came here to watch this historic moment with other people. This has never happened before in Egypt."" A popular revolt forced Mubarak to step down February 11, leaving the nation under the control of a military council. He has been hospitalized since suffering heart palpitations in April, but the nation's health officials declared last month that he is ""fit to stand trial, given a proper transportation arrangement."" Former Israeli Cabinet minister Benjamin Ben Eliezer told Israeli Radio Wednesday that he had offered Mubarak refuge in the southern Israeli city of Eilat. ""Mubarak is a patriot and therefore turned down the offer,"" Ben Eliezer said. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Arab-language news network Al-Arabiya that he respects Mubarak and hopes Egypt's next government maintains its commitment to peace with his country. However, his office said Thursday that Netanyahu has made no offers of asylum to Mubarak. CNN's Amir Ahmed, Frederik Pleitgen, Faith Karimi, Mohammed Jamjoom, Rima Maktabi and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Arab media call it the trial of the century .

"(Budget Travel) -- Getting a visa can be a thicket of red tape -- or as easy as pie. Whether you should hire someone or do it yourself depends on where you're going. Article key . DIY Do-it-yourself. Visas are easy to get on your own. $ Pay somebody. Save time and frustration by hiring some expert help. Australia (DIY) The easiest and cheapest method is applying online for an Electronic Travel Authority, a stampless visa ($17, eta.immi.gov.au). After completing a form that requires your passport details and a credit card, you can be approved in 30 seconds. You can also apply for an ETA in person at the embassy for free. Securing a visa by regular mail from the Washington, D.C., embassy is possible (austemb.org), but it costs $70 and takes two weeks. If you want help: The Australian government doesn't charge for visas arranged through expediters or travel agents, so all you'll have to pay is the company's fee. (PassportVisasExpress.com charges $20 for two-day processing.) Qantas agents can get you an electronic visa within 15 minutes for $25. Tour operators often handle visas, and some charge for the service. Newmans South Pacific Vacations will deduct its $25 processing fee if you take care of the visa yourself. Brazil ($) Visas cost $100, and it's worth it to hire a specialist (see below). Travel Document Systems' three- to seven-day service is $45; PassportVisasExpress.com charges $59 for seven-day processing. Brazil tacks on a $10 surcharge for visas handled by third parties. To save money: The rules for doing your own paperwork depend on where you live (brasilemb.org). To get a visa from the consulates in San Francisco or New York, you must apply in person or pay an extra $10 if a third party appears for you. In San Francisco, visas are typically processed in five business days and can be sent to you via a U.S. Postal Service prepaid envelope, so bring one with you. In New York, visas are usually ready in 24 hours but must be picked up by someone. If you live near Chicago or D.C., you can apply by mail to those consulates. There's a $10 handling fee; allow at least three weeks. Most Brazilian consulates only accept U.S.P.S. money orders. And if you apply by mail, most require you to use U.S.P.S. Express Mail. China ($) Specialists charge $45-$55 on top of the $100 consular fee (up from $50 as of August 1) to get you a visa in about four days. If you book a package, the operator will take care of your application for $20-$30, shipping included. To save money: Apply in person or send a third party to the embassy in D.C., or the consulates in Chicago, Houston, L.A., New York City or San Francisco (china-embassy.org). There's no option to apply by mail, but visas will be mailed back to you if you supply a prepaid envelope. You should allow at least four business days for regular processing, or add an extra $30 for same-day service. Cashier's checks, money orders and cash are OK. Egypt (DIY) U.S. passport holders can pay $15 for a visa at the Cairo airport. Stop by the visa-payment booth before getting in line for immigration and customs. To apply in advance: You can apply by mail to an Egyptian consulate; allow a week or more for processing (egyptembassy.net). You can also go to the New York consulate and get a visa that day; the San Francisco one needs at least 24 hours for processing. Some consulates only take money orders and certified or cashier's checks. A visa specialist can get a visa in three days starting at $45. To save time: Travelers with Foreign Independent Tours and Misr Travel can pay an extra $20-$25 to have a staffer meet them at the Cairo airport with a prepaid visa sticker. That way, they can go directly to immigration. India (DIY) Beware the 15-day transit visa: It only costs $30, but the countdown begins the moment the consulate stamps the visa. Instead, opt for the $60, six-month tourist visa. If you're booking your trip through a tour operator or travel agent, ask them to deal with the visa. Many will do it for free -- all you have to pay is the fee (with a cashier's or certified check or a money order) and fill out the forms, which they can help with. The process takes about a week. Getting a visa from a consulate yourself via mail also takes about a week. To save time: Apply before 12:30 P.M. at any of the five consulates in the U.S. (indianembassy.org), and you can get a visa that afternoon. Cash, money orders, and certified or cashier's checks only. If you want help: Compare expediters' prices. PassportVisasExpress.com charges $59 (seven days), while Zierer Visa Service asks $55 (10 days). Kenya (DIY) Get a visa for $50 (U.S. cash only) at the airport upon arrival. Forms are available at the airport. To apply in advance: If you're mailing your paperwork, allow at least seven days -- and up to 16 days from May through August. It's possible to get a visa within a day if you apply in person and pay a $10 rush fee at the consulates in New York and L.A. or the embassy in D.C. (kenyaembassy.com). Cashier's checks and money orders only. If you want help: Expediters charge from $39 for seven-day processing, and $55 or so for four-day service. Russia ($) Beyond the $100 fee, tourist visas require proof of a Russia-based sponsor (often a tour operator). Expect to pay $45-$55 for assistance if your trip is booked through the operator, and more if you arranged your trip some other way. Alternately, Travel Document Systems charges $45 for 10-day processing. If you need a visa sooner, the fees go up, and the consulate tacks on charges: $50 for three- to five-day processing, $100 for next-day service, or $200 if you require same-day turnaround. To save money: You still need to show that you have a sponsor -- a hotel in Russia will do. Your hotel should have the standard tourist confirmation document that you need to submit with your applications. You'll need a confirmation document for each place you stay. Apply in person or by mail through a consulate, and be sure to include a prepaid return envelope; payment must be through cashier's check or money order (russianembassy.org). You should allow 6 to 10 business days for processing. Turkey (DIY) Pay $20 at the Istanbul airport visa booth before going to immigration. To apply in advance: Visas processed by mail cost $9 more and can take three weeks (turkishembassy.org). Consulates accept money orders and cashier's checks by mail and cash in person. You used to be able to apply online for $29, but the service is down and no one knows when it'll be operating again. If you want help: PassportVisasExpress.com charges $39 for two-day service. Vietnam (DIY) The prices and policies vary by consulate, and you need not apply via your regional office (vietnamembassy-usa.org). The San Francisco consulate charges $45 for three-day processing and $65 for next-day service. Others ask more -- four-day service from New York, for example, is $105. For D.C., include a prepaid U.S.P.S. Express Mail envelope. If you want help: PassportVisasExpress.com charges $89 for four-day service; Travel Document Systems charges $45 (7 to 10 days). There's also the somewhat complicated option of asking a travel agent or tour operator to get an approval letter from the immigration department in Hanoi. Through Sinhcafe Travel, for example, you pay $30, get your letter in a week or so, and then bring the letter and $25 more to the airport. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Has the new president turned around America's image in other countries? You could call it step one, with many more to go. Then-candidate Barack Obama gave a major speech in Berlin, Germany, in July of 2008. In 2004, President Bush visited Canada and faced massive protests and shouts of ""George Bush go home!"" But on Thursday, President Obama got a different reception when he crossed the northern border: adoring throngs of Canadians shouting, ""Yes we can!"" The new president vowed during the campaign to remake the image of the United States in the world. Last summer, for example, candidate Obama traveled to Europe and addressed thousands in Berlin, Germany. ""In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in the world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common,"" Obama said when he spoke not far from what was once the Berlin Wall. But the public relations blitz that began during the campaign won't be limited to Europe in the Obama administration, as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton demonstrated when she traveled to Southeast Asia this week. ""We're reaching out to the entire world,"" she said in Indonesia. ""It's not only the ASEAN countries that feel like the United States has been absent.""  Watch more of Clinton's trip to Asia » . A survey released by the Pew Global Attitudes Project in December indicates that between 2002 and 2008, favorable opinion of the United States declined in 14 out of the 19 countries polled. In Indonesia, where Clinton visited Wednesday and where Obama spent part of his childhood, favorable opinion of the United States plummeted from 61 percent to just 37 percent. Americans appear confident that world opinion can change under the new president. Last year, when Bush was president, only 24 percent of Americans believed world leaders respected the U.S. president, according to a recent Gallup poll. Now that Obama is in office, two-thirds of Americans believe the president is respected by world leaders. But Americans don't think global attitudes toward the United States have shifted significantly. Just 45 percent of Americans now believe the country rates favorably in the eyes of the world, Gallup found. That's only two points higher than last year. Americans and the rest of the world are waiting to see what kinds of policy changes President Obama will make.  Watch more on Obama's visit to Canada » . The biggest change so far? Closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. More changes have been promised. ""This is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the Middle East,"" Obama said in Berlin. He also promised action on climate change. ""This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet,"" he said in the same speech. Canada -- where on Thursday Obama made his first foreign trip as president -- is one country where opinion may be shifting in America's favor. Just 36 percent of Canadians say their country's relationship with the United States has been good during the last couple of years, according to a recent Canadian Press/Harris-Decima survey. But more than twice that many -- 74 percent -- expect relations to be good in coming years. However, there are some thorny problems ahead for the two countries, particularly regarding Afghanistan. Obama has announced he will send an additional 17,000 U.S. troops to that country. But when Canadians were asked about extending their own troops' mission in Afghanistan, they were opposed by nearly 2 to 1. The world loves Obama. But does the world love the United States? That relationship still needs some work.","Schneider: ""The world loves Obama. But does the world love the United States?""

"(CNN) -- Guards at the California state prison known as ""New Folsom"" put down a brief riot Wednesday that left 13 inmates hospitalized, including one shot by a correctional officer, prison officials said. About 60 to 70 inmates were involved in the disturbance at California State Prison-Sacramento, said Lt. Tony Quinn, a penitentiary spokesman. Eight of those taken to the hospital had stab wounds, while a guard shot one inmate in the ""hip or flank area,"" Quinn said. The disturbance broke out in an exercise yard for maximum-security inmates Wednesday morning, the state Department of Corrections said. No staff members were injured, and Quinn said order was restored within 10 minutes. Guards found four inmate-made weapons in the yard after the riot, he said. The facility opened in 1986 and now holds more than 2,600 prisoners, Quinn said. It's next door to the Folsom State Prison made famous by singer Johnny Cash, and it was designated New Folsom Prison until 1992. CNN's Darrell Calhoun contributed to this report.","A guard shot one inmate, prison officials say; eight others stabbed during disturbance .

"(CNN) -- On a day when global doomsday predictions failed to pan out, NASA had more good news for the Earth: An asteroid feared to be on a collision course with our planet no longer poses a threat. Uncertainties about the orbit of the asteroid, known as 2011 AG5, previously allowed for a less than a 1% chance it would hit the Earth in February 2040, NASA said. To narrow down the asteroid's future course, NASA put out a call for more observation. Astronomers from the University of Hawaii at Manoa took up the task and managed to observe the asteroid over several days in October. ""An analysis of the new data conducted by NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, shows that the risk of collision in 2040 has been eliminated,"" NASA declared Friday. The new observations, made with the Gemini 8-meter telescope in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, reduce the orbit uncertainties by more than a factor of 60. That means the Earth's position in February 2040 is not in range of the asteroid's possible future paths. The asteroid, which is 140 meters (460 feet) in diameter, will get no closer to Earth than 890,000 kilometers (553,000 miles), or more than twice the distance to the moon, NASA said. A collision with Earth would have released about 100 megatons of energy, several thousand times more powerful than the atomic bombs that ended World War II, according to the Gemini Observatory. Observing the asteroid wasn't easy, said David Tholen, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy. The asteroid's position was very close to the sun, so astronomers had to observe it when the sky was dark. Tholen told CNN there was about a half-hour between when the asteroid got high enough in the sky for the telescope to point at it and before the sky became too light to observe it. Because the astronomers were looking at the asteroid low in the sky, they were viewing it through a lot of atmosphere, which scattered some of the light and made the object fainter, he said. ""The second effect is the turbulence of the atmosphere makes things fainter,"" Tholen said. ""We had to keep trying over and over until we got one of those nights when the atmosphere was calm."" Tholen and the team also discovered the asteroid is elongated, so that as it rotates, its brightness changes. That was another challenge for the astronomers: Because they didn't know the asteroid's rotation period, they didn't know when it would wax and wane, and when it would grow too faint to see. ""This object was changing its brightness by a factor of three or four -- it was just enormously variable,"" Tholen said. ""It was hit and miss depending on which night you observed it."" Many predicted the end of the world would come Friday, the day on which a long phase in the ancient Mayan calendar came to an end. Some believe the day actually comes Sunday. Modern-day Mayans say the end of the calendar phase doesn't mean the end of the world -- just the end of an era, and the start of a new one. NASA estimates 4,700 'potentially hazardous' asteroids .","The asteroid previously had a 0.2% chance of hitting the Earth .

"(CNN) -- At least 19 soldiers were killed over the weekend in separate clashes with rebels in Colombia, the country's president said. President Juan Manuel Santos reported attacks by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC, in Arauca and Caqueta. In the department of Arauca, which borders Venezuela, rebels ambushed a group of soldiers guarding an oil pipeline. Fifteen soldiers were killed and 12 rebels were captured, Santos said. Another four soldiers were killed in Caqueta, which is a department in the south of the country. ""The instructions to our forces are as follows: Don't stop shooting, even for an instant until we reach the end of the conflict,"" the president said, according to his office. Santos vowed operations will continue until those responsible are held to account. The violence comes amid peace talks between the government and the FARC. The two sides have been at war since the 1960s. Santos has said he wants talks, which started last year and are taking place in Cuba, wrapped up by November. There have been sporadic attempts at peace in the past. The last effort fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group, but he ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position.","15 soldiers are killed in one attack, four in another .

"London (CNN) -- The UK government Tuesday blocked the extradition of computer hacker Gary McKinnon to the United States to face trial for what the U.S. government says is the biggest military computer hacking of all time. Home Secretary Theresa May said McKinnon was accused of serious crimes -- but that ""there is also no doubt that he is seriously ill."" The extradition order against McKinnon should be withdrawn because his Asperger syndrome and depressive illness meant ""there is such a high risk of him ending his own life that a decision to extradite would be incompatible with his human rights,"" she said. McKinnon has admitted to breaking into computers at NASA and the Pentagon but says he did so to find out if the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs. The 46-year-old has fought a decade-long battle against extradition. The UK director of public prosecutions will now look at whether McKinnon should face trial in a UK court, May said. McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, who has campaigned for years on his behalf, told a news conference it had been ""an emotional roller coaster"" but that she was incredibly happy at the result. The decision to block extradition saved her son's life, she said. He cried when he first heard the ruling but she had now seen him smile ""for the first time in years."" Sharp also praised May for ""an incredibly brave decision -- to stand up to another nation as strong and powerful as America is rare."" McKinnon's lawyer, Karen Todner, said it was ""a great day for British justice"" and that she hoped UK prosecutors ""might consider that Gary has suffered enough."" She also suggested he might be considered unfit to plead in a UK court given his mental health issues. Rights group Liberty also welcomed what it said was a ""long-overdue"" decision involving a vulnerable man. ""It's a great day for compassion and common sense,"" said Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti. The U.S. State Department is examining the decision. ""The United States is disappointed by the decision to deny Gary McKinnon's extradition to face long overdue justice in the United States,"" spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Tuesday. The U.S. government says McKinnon accessed 97 computers from his home in London for a year starting in March 2001, costing the government about $1 million. He is accused of breaking into military, NASA and civilian networks, and accessing computers at the Pentagon; Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Meade, Maryland; the Earle Naval Weapons Station in Colts Neck, New Jersey; and the Johnson Space Center in Houston, among others. In one case, McKinnon allegedly crashed computers belonging to the Military District of Washington. But McKinnon's family and Todner had argued against the extradition on human rights grounds because he has Asperger syndrome. People with the syndrome suffer difficulty in social relationships, communication and social imagination, according to The National Autistic Society in Britain. Asperger syndrome may often include having special interests and becoming anxious if a routine is broken. Psychiatrists who examined McKinnon said there was a risk of suicide if he was sent to the United States. Sharp reiterated that point Tuesday, saying her son told her he ""felt like a dead person,"" and that he would have preferred suicide to being taken thousands of miles away from his family and everything he knew. As well as Asperger syndrome, McKinnon has other mental health issues, including lifelong schizophrenia, she added. Todner has also complained that the United States has never provided evidence to prosecutors or McKinnon's legal team to support its extradition request. However, under Britain's Extradition Act of 2003, U.S. prosecutors are not required to provide such evidence. Critics have long argued that Britain's extradition treaties unfairly deny its citizens the chance to have the evidence against them considered by a British court before they are extradited. In response to such concerns, May outlined Tuesday a series of proposals intended to make the extradition process both with the United States and within the European Union, under the European Arrest Warrant, quicker and more transparent. The proposals include the introduction of a so-called ""forum bar,"" she said. ""This will mean that where prosecution is possible in both the UK and in another state, the British courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas, if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so."" Her remarks follow a two-year review of Britain's extradition arrangements. Chakrabarti pointed out that May's decision to block McKinnon's extradition was only possible because of a provision in the Human Rights Act, controversial legislation which the Liberty director described as ""much maligned"" in Britain. McKinnon was on the brink of extradition in August 2008, when the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, refused to reconsider the decision to send him to the United States, effectively clearing the way for his transfer. He has been free on bail in England while the extradition process has been going on. A U.S. federal grand jury indicted McKinnon on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity. If convicted, he would have faced a maximum of 10 years in prison on each count and a $250,000 fine.","NEW: The U.S. State Department is ""disappointed"" by the decision .

"(CNN) -- A cheating scandal at Harvard College just got bigger, and this time the focus is flipped: Administrators, not students, are under fire. On Monday, the school apologized for the way it handled a secret search of the e-mail accounts of resident deans. It conducted the search in an effort to find who leaked information about the scandal to the media last year. ""While the specific document made public may be deemed by some as not particularly consequential, the disclosure of the document and nearly word-for-word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk,"" said a statement from Deans Michael D. Smith and Evelynn M. Hammonds. ""Consequently, with the approval of the dean of FAS (Faculty of Arts and Sciences) and the University General Counsel, and the support of the dean of Harvard College, a very narrow, careful, and precise subject-line search was conducted by the University's IT department,"" they added. Smith and Hammonds stressed that the search was limited to administrative accounts, and that it did not involve a review of e-mail content. Harvard students forced to withdraw amid cheating scandal . ""To be clear: No one's e-mails were opened and the contents of no one's e-mails were searched by human or machine,"" they said. The search successfully identified a resident dean, who had forwarded a confidential e-mail. However, after review, school officials determined the dean in question had committed ""an inadvertent error and not an intentional breach"" by sending the message to two students. Other resident deans were not told of the search, which was first reported by The Boston Globe. ""Operating without any clear precedent for the conflicting privacy concerns and knowing that no human had looked at any e-mails during or after the investigation, we made a decision that protected the privacy of the resident dean who had made an inadvertent error and allowed the student cases being handled by this resident dean to move forward expeditiously,"" Smith and Hammonds said. ""We understand that others may see the situation differently, and we apologize if any resident deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient,"" they added. News of the secret search drew immediate criticism from some members of Harvard's faculty. Harry Lewis, a professor and former dean of Harvard College, said on his blog that he will likely move most of his personal e-mails to another account, keeping his Harvard address just for business. He described the way the school handled the case as dishonorable. ""Why not tell people you are reading their e-mail? Would it not be the honorable thing to do? What is to be gained by not doing that? Other than avoiding, perhaps, the embarrassment of acknowledging that you are doing something to which the targets would reasonably object if they knew it,"" he wrote. Attempts to contact Harvard for details on Monday on the search and the handling of it were unsuccessful. Last month, the school announced that more than half the students implicated in the cheating scandal had been required to withdraw for a time. More than a hundred students were investigated for plagiarism or for having ""inappropriately collaborated"" on a course's take-home, open-book spring final exam. The class was Government 1310: Introduction to Congress, according to The Harvard Crimson, the school's student newspaper. Many of those who were not forced to withdraw faced disciplinary probation at the Ivy League institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the remaining were cleared. CNN's Rande Iaboni contributed to this report.","Harvard searches the administrative accounts of resident deans .

"(CNN) -- Osiel Cardenas Guillen, the former head of a powerful Mexican drug cartel, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and will forfeit to the United States $50 million in illegal proceeds, a judge ruled. Cardenas Guillen, 42, was the leader of the Matamoros, Mexico-based Gulf cartel until his capture in 2003. He was subsequently extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges in 2007. U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle handed down the sentence Wednesday, following an earlier guilty plea by the drug kingpin. Under Cardenas Guillen's leadership, the Gulf cartel was responsible for smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine and marijuana into the United States, the FBI said in a news release. Read the original indictment . According to the FBI, in 1999 Cardenas Guillen threatened to kill a U.S. undercover sheriff's deputy. In another incident, he threatened the lives of two U.S. agents. ""The successful prosecution of Cardenas Guillen underscores the joint resolve of the United States and Mexico to pursue and prosecute the leadership of the drug trafficking cartels, dismantle their organizations and end the violence and corruption they have spawned,"" U.S. Attorney Jose Angel Moreno said. Cardenas Guillen pleaded guilty to five felony charges, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, conspiracy to launder money and threatening to assault and kill federal agents. Tagle also fined Cardenas Guillen $100,000 and ordered him to five years probation once his sentence is served.

"Rome (CNN) -- A plain clothes policeman watches Francesco Zanardi. As he waits for his moment just outside the Vatican in St Peter's Square, Zanardi's intention is clear. So is the policeman's. The 42-year-old from Savona has traveled 550 kilometers [342 miles] to Rome, determined to make a delivery at the Vatican. The policeman, however, is just as determined to stop him. Zanardi clutches a red case, emblazoned with a picture of Domenico Calcagno -- one of the cardinals who will elect a new pope in the conclave this week -- across it are the words, ""Fuori Dal Conclave"" or ""Out of the Conclave."" It's stuffed with thousands of signed letters all claiming that Calcagno covered up the serial sex abuse of a priest in northern Italy. They want the cardinal to be disqualified from voting in the conclave. But no one is more insistent than Francesco Zanardi. When he was an 11-year-old altar boy in 1981 at the Santissime Anunziate church in the town of Spotorno, Zanardi says he was raped by Father Nello Giraudo at least once a week for 5 years. He says many of his school friends also suffered repeated abuse at the hands of Giraudo. ""I didn't have [consensual] sex until I was 26,"" Zanardi says in Italian. ""I was using drugs, I used to inject heroin. I went into rehab and had counseling, and later realized I was taking drugs because of the abuse."" His quest to reveal the truth behind what happened to him eventually uncovered a cache of damning documents that went all the way to former Pope Benedict XVI. First Zanardi attempted to prosecute Giraudo for the abuse he suffered but the statute of limitations had expired in his case. So he had to pursue other means of gaining justice. Only last year, Giraudo was convicted for sexually abusing a boy at a Catholic boy scouts retreat in the Piedmont Mountains in 2005. Giraudo pled guilty and Zanardi was instrumental in the trial. He gave evidence and convinced four boys, who were allegedly sexually abused by Giraudo, to do the same and prove the former priest was a serial abuser. Despite the long pattern of behavior, Giraudo was sentenced as a first-time offender and given a suspended one year prison term. As a witness, Zanardi was allowed to request all the evidence from the court. He was astonished by what he discovered. On 8th September 2003, Calcagno, who was at the time the Bishop of Savona, wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger who was then the Vatican's enforcer of church doctrine and responsible for investigations into the sexual abuse of minors by clergy. Calcagno's letter read: ""I would request your kind advice on how I should act in view of the fact that the priest intends to continue his pastoral work. As far as possible, I intend to avoid him having any responsibilities which might bring him into contact with children or adolescents."" Watch: Papal conclave 101 . This letter was accompanied by a church dossier on Giraudo, compiled by then Bishop Calcagno's chief aide, Vicar General, Andrea Giusto. ""Nothing has leaked to the papers. No complaints have been filed with the police,"" read Giusto's report. ""The documents were ugly to read,"" Zanardi told CNN. The church was concerned with the well-being of a pedophile, but they don't talk about a victim. The victims aren't even taken into consideration the only thing they are trying save is the image of the church."" Despite incontrovertible evidence against Giraudo, Calcagno didn't kick the pedophile priest out of the church. Instead, he was given counseling, sent to work with prison inmates and simply moved from parish to parish. He was even allowed to set-up and run a care home for troubled children in the church rectory. We don't know Cardinal Ratzinger's response to this letter. Two years later -- in 2005 -- Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI. Further documents reveal church officials were aware of Giraudo's crimes from as far back as 1980. On 29th March 2010, Archbishop Ladaria from Thibica wrote to the current Bishop of Savona, Vittoria Lupi. It says Giraudo ""was reported in 1980 for abuse of minors"" and that Giraudo admitted his own ""pedophile tendencies"" to the Vicar General of Savona in 2002. Despite all this, it took more than 30 years before the Church forced Giraudo to write a letter of resignation on March 27th, 2010. Papal Conclave: By the numbers . Cardinal Calcagno's office declined to give a comment to CNN and in a written statement, the Diocese of Savona, where Giraudo served as a priest, said the Diocese invited him to resign in 2009, but he refused. It went on to say the diocese has been in the forefront of combating abuse by priests. Vatican spokesman, Rev. Thomas Lombardi is clearly aggravated by our question about the accusations against Calcagno. He folds his arms, leans back and speaks sternly. ""The accusations regarding Cardinal Domenico Calcagno when he was Bishop of Savona in Italy were investigated by both the Church and by the legal system, by the judge, and the accusations were without foundation."" Back in St Peter's Square, Zanardi finally makes his move towards the gates of the Vatican but he doesn't get far. The plain-clothes policeman lurking in the background radios his partner and within seconds Zanardi is surrounded by police who lead him away for two hours of questioning. Zanardi has faced many obstacles in his life but he's not about to give up now just because he's hit another one. He will try to deliver his anti-Calcagno petition at the Vatican Embassy in Rome on Monday. His resolve is undimmed. ""What happened to me and many others should never have happened. I will keep fighting until it does not happen again."" Dan Rivers contributed to this report .","Domenico Calcagno is one of the cardinals who this week will start to elect a new pope .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Seventy days after his sudden death, Michael Jackson will be interred in what may or may not be his final resting place Thursday evening. A private funeral for Michael Jackson will be held Thursday in Glendale, California, his family says. Only his family and closest friends will attend the private burial starting at 7 p.m. PT (10 p.m. ET) inside the ornate Great Mausoleum on the grounds of Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California. They'll then drive to an Italian restaurant eight miles away in Pasadena, California for ""a time of celebration,"" the nine-page engraved invitation said. The first page inside the invitation holds a quote from ""Dancing the Dream,"" a book of essays and poems published by Jackson in 1992: . ""If you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same, then everything that happens in between can be dealt with.""  Gallery: Invitation for Jackson's service » . The news media -- which have closely covered every aspect of Jackson's death -- will be kept at a distance, with their cameras no closer than the cemetery's main gate. The family will provide a limited video feed that will only show mourners arriving. Little is known about the planned ceremony, though CNN has confirmed that singer Gladys Knight -- a longtime friend to Jackson -- will perform. Her song has not been disclosed. The massive mausoleum, which is normally open to tourists, was closed Wednesday as preparations were completed for the funeral. A security guard blocking its entrance said it would reopen to the public on Friday. Fans of Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and dozens of other celebrities buried on the grounds have flocked to Forest Lawn-Glendale for decades, but Jackson may outdraw them all. It is unclear how close tourists will be allowed to Jackson's resting place. Security guards -- aided by cameras -- keep a constant vigil over the graves and crypts, which are surrounded by a world-class collection of art and architecture. The Forest Lawn Web site boasts that the mausoleum, which draws its architectural inspiration from the Campo Santo in Italy, ""has been called the ""New World's Westminster Abbey"" by Time Magazine. Visitors will see ""exact replicas of Michelangelo's greatest works such as David, Moses, and La Pieta"" and ""Leonardo da Vinci's immortal Last Supper re-created in brilliant stained glass; two of the world's largest paintings,"" the Web site says. Jackson's burial has been delayed by division among Jackson family members, though it was matriarch Katherine Jackson who would make the final decision, brother Jermaine Jackson recently told CNN. He preferred to see his youngest brother laid to rest at his former Neverland Ranch home, north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara County, California. That idea was complicated by neighbors who vowed to oppose allowing a grave in the rural area -- and by Jackson family members who said the singer would not want to return to the home where he faced child molestation charges, of which he was ultimately acquitted. The mystery of where Michael Jackson would be buried became a media obsession in the weeks after his death. After his body was loaded onto a helicopter at UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center hours following his June 25 death, it stayed in the custody of the Los Angeles County coroner for an autopsy. It was only later disclosed that Jackson's corpse was kept in a refrigerated room at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery until his casket was carried by motorcade to downtown Los Angeles for a public memorial service in the Staples Center arena. Again, speculation about Jackson's whereabouts grew when the media lost track of his casket after his brothers carried it out of sight inside the arena. Though the family has not publicly confirmed where the body was taken, most reports placed it back at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn while awaiting his family's decision. Though Thursday's interment may settle one Michael Jackson mystery, a more serious one remains. The coroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson's death a homicide. A summary of the coroner's report said the anesthetic propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the singer's death. Los Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation and no one has been charged.","NEW: Michael Jackson burial to begin at 7 p.m. PT (10 p.m. ET)

"Washington (CNN) -- Video and audio baby monitors are intended to give parents peace of mind, but the federal government is warning parents that the devices can be deadly if not placed out of reach of small children. Since 2002, seven children have died and three nearly strangled when they became entangled in the cords of devices intended for their protection. On Wednesday, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, along with the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, an organization representing makers of children's products, launched a baby safety campaign to alert parents and caregivers about cord strangulation dangers. Get bumpers out of cribs, doctor group urges . The key message -- keep baby monitors at least 3 feet away from cribs. ""Children are curious, they'll reach out if they can get it within their grasp, and that cord ends up around their neck and strangling them,"" CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum said. For parents Charles Pereira and Lisa Rushton, the warnings come too late. In 2010, their 10-month-old daughter, Savannah, died after becoming wrapped in the cord of her baby monitor. ""Most people buy them thinking that they're a safety improvement for the child when, in fact, corded monitors present a very real threat to the life of a child,"" Pereira told CNN. Getting the word out about the dangers of the cords has been a mission of Pereira and Rushton since their loss. The couple said Savannah had just learned to pull herself up into the standing position. ""We were so excited about it. And actually I recall saying to him, we're going to need to take a look at everything and make sure that everything is safe around the house,"" Rushton said. Children die after gas fireplace left on . Wednesday's warning marks the second time in two years that the CPSC has cautioned parents about cord strangulation dangers. The latest announcement was accompanied by the launch of a national baby safety campaign that includes a website, video and advertising warning of the dangers cords pose. Parents can also obtain free warning labels to attach to baby monitor cords. Rushton and Pereira were concerned about Savannah's safety. ""I was very aware of the danger of cords. And it was something I kind of obsessed over -- which seems crazy at this point in time,"" Rushton said. ""Where it was placed at the time, she was unable to reach it. But she reached a milestone just 24 hours before the accident occurred, and we didn't have an opportunity to reassess the room."" Stupid things parents do that put their kids at risk .

"Editor's note: This is part one of a two-part series. Jim Fontella was based at Camp Lejeune in 1966 and 1967. He was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. TAMPA, Florida (CNN) -- The sick men are Marines, or sons of Marines. All 20 of them were based at or lived at Camp Lejeune, the U.S. Marine Corps' training base in North Carolina, between the 1960s and the 1980s. They all have had breast cancer, a disease that strikes fewer than 2,000 men in the United States a year, compared with about 200,000 women. Each has had part of his chest removed as part of his treatment, along with chemotherapy, radiation or both. And they blame their time at Camp Lejeune, where government records show drinking water was contaminated with high levels of toxic chemicals for three decades, for their illnesses. ""We come from all walks of life,"" said Mike Partain, the son and grandson of Marines, who was born on the base 40 years ago. ""And some of us have college degrees, some of us have blue-collar jobs. We are all over the country. And what is our commonality? Our commonality is that we all at some point in our lives drank the water at Camp Lejeune. Go figure."" Starting in 1980, tests showed drinking water at Camp Lejeune had been ""highly contaminated"" with solvents. Several wells that supplied water to the base were found to have been contaminated in 1984 and 1985, and were promptly taken out of service after the pollutants were found, the Marine Corps told CNN. Among the chemicals later identified in the drinking water were trichloroethylene, a degreaser; benzene; and the dry cleaning solvent perchloroethylene. Two independent studies have found no link between water contamination and later illnesses, according to the Marine Corps. But the men facing a debilitating and possibly lethal disease don't buy it. ""That's literally unheard of to have 20 men come from the same place, walking on the same dirt, drinking the same water,"" said Jim Fontella, who was based at the camp in 1966 and 1967. ""I mean, there has to be a link there somehow. And they're saying that it couldn't happen."" Fontella, a Detroit native who fought in Vietnam, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. When it returned after surgery, spreading to his spine and back, he ""kind of manned up to it after a while and expected to die."" ""Once you have metastasis in the bone, it's basically just a matter of time before you die, you know,"" he told CNN. ""Luckily, I have already passed my due date by five years. I outlived that death sentence I got."" Fontella is one of seven male breast cancer survivors who spent time at Camp Lejeune who spoke to CNN. Fontella said that at the time of his diagnosis, he didn't know men could get breast cancer. Peter Devereaux, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, was based at Camp Lejeune in 1981 and 1982. The cancer spread to his spine, ribs and hips. ""The difference with metastatic breast cancer means now there's no cure. So the average life expectancy is two to three years,"" Devereaux told CNN. ""Being a man, I try to take care of my wife and my daughter,"" he said, his voice catching. ""Now that I'm considered disabled because I can no longer work and use my arms, you're having challenges."" Dr. John Kiluk, a breast cancer surgeon at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, said he's startled by the common threads among the group. ""The average breast cancer patient for males is about 70 years old,"" Kiluk said. ""So when you have gentlemen in their 30s stepping forward, without a family history of breast cancer, that is alarming. And the question is, why? Why is this happening?"" As many as 500,000 people may have been exposed to the contaminated water over a period of 30 years, the Marine Corps said. Partain, Fontella, Devereaux and others CNN interviewed are all members of ""The Few, The Proud, The Forgotten,"" which was set up to organize people who believe they have been affected by the contamination. But in a written response to questions raised by the men, the Marine Corps told CNN that two studies have examined whether contaminated water led to illnesses among base personnel or their families. ""To date, these studies have not identified a link between exposure to the historically impacted water at Camp Lejeune and adverse health effects,"" the service said. In addition, it said a 2004 review by the Marine Corps found the service followed existing water quality regulations. And investigations by the Bush administration's Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency found no criminal conduct by Marine Corps officials and no violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. But Tyler Amon, an EPA investigator, told a House committee in 2007 that some employees interviewed during the criminal investigation appeared to have been coached and were not forthcoming with details. The Justice Department decided against filing charges based on his concern, however. Parts of Camp Lejeune have been included on the EPA's Superfund list of contaminated sites. Benzene, one of the chemicals found in the water there, is classified as a known human carcinogen by the federal government, while the other two are listed as potential causes of cancer. Frank Bove, an epidemiologist with the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, said the level of contamination in one sample taken at Camp Lejeune was ""the highest I've ever seen in a public water system in this country."" But, he added, ""Whether exposures were long enough and high enough at Camp Lejeune to cause disease -- that's the question."" Researchers need to know more about where the men lived on the base, what kind of work they did, their medical histories and other details before reaching a conclusion, Bove said. ""We're not sure there's one common cause across all these cases,"" he said. ""There may be several different causes."" The Marines Corps said it has worked with environmental and health agencies ""from the beginning"" to determine whether the contamination resulted in any illness, and ""this collaboration continues to the present day."" But so far, ""collaboration"" does not involve medical care for the stricken men, who say they are now facing a bureaucratic Catch-22: The Marine Corps sends them to the Department of Veterans Affairs, which says it can't treat the men for a condition that hasn't been shown to have been ""service-related."" ""How could they do this to me after I served the country faithfully?"" retired Marine Rick Kelly told CNN. ""How could they do this to my fellow Marines?""","20 people, all Marines or sons of Marines, have had male breast cancer .

"(CNN) -- UEFA president Michel Platini claims that goal-line technology is not needed in soccer, stating it would lead to ""PlayStation football."" World governing body FIFA will test possible goal-line systems in the coming months after reversing its stance on the widely-debated issue, but the head of the sport in Europe is not in favor of the prospective changes. When asked about the potential use of goal-line technology during a visit to the city of Glasgow, the Frenchman referred to the popular video-game console when he told the Scottish FA website: ""Then we will have PlayStation football."" Platini, one of the world's top footballers during the 1980s, believes more help should instead be offered to referees, highlighting the use of two extra match officials in this season's Champion's League as a better way forward. ""The referee has to be helped by clubs, fans, players, media and authorities,"" Platini said on Monday. ""It is why we have added two assistants for Champions League games. ""One referee is not enough, not in the modern era where you have 20 cameras."" The 55-year-old also said the high media presence at modern-day games does not help match officials, with television cameras able to instantly see when mistakes have been made by referees. ""It is unfair -- the cameras can see everything but the referee only has one pair of eyes. Every time he makes a mistake, those cameras are there to focus on it. ""It is why for the past 10 years I have asked to change the job of the referee, to help improve the situation and to give the referees better support."" The subject of goal-line technology has long been hotly-debated within football, and the issue came to the fore once again at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa when England's Frank Lampard had a goal not given against Germany despite the ball crossing the line.","Michel Platini questions plans to experiment with goal-line technology .

"(CNN) -- The police chief of a city in the southern Philippines was briefly held captive Tuesday by Muslim rebels who have been fighting security forces for the past several days. Senior Superintendent Jose Chiquito Malayo was negotiating with the rebels for the release of more civilians Tuesday morning ""when he was himself abducted at gunpoint and held hostage by the rebel group,"" the Philippine National Police said. His capture took place in a coastal area of mangroves near Zamboanga City, a major trading hub that has been paralyzed for more than a week after the rebels took large numbers of people hostage. Malayo re-emerged later Tuesday, bringing with him 23 suspected rebels who had surrendered, officials said. That drama came on the same day that authorities announced significant progress against the rebels. Officials said that about 150 hostages had been rescued. Helicopters fire rockets at Muslim rebels in siege . It was unclear how many people remained captive. Since Friday, the Philippine armed forces have been carrying out an operation to try to ""constrict"" the rebels, who came ashore early last week and took as many as 180 hostages in several coastal districts. Military attack helicopters fired rockets at rebel positions Monday. The recent violence has significantly disrupted life in Zamboanga, a mainly Christian city on the southwestern tip of Mindanao, the southernmost island in the Philippines. The crisis has increased fears of instability in a region where the Philippine central government is pursuing a new peace plan after decades of unrest. President Benigno Aquino III and other top Philippine officials are overseeing authorities' response. Authorities estimate the violence has left more than 100 people dead, most of them rebels, and displaced more than 80,000 residents. Military officials say they have captured scores of rebels and handed them over to police. No truce: Army, Islamic militants fight on in Philippines . The unrest has also closed schools and businesses. Hundreds of houses have caught fire during the fighting. Authorities have accused the rebels of deliberately starting the fires. The rebels are believed to be a faction of the Moro National Liberation Front, a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Nur Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in the mainly Catholic Philippines. The MNLF signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996, but some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign. Last month, Misuari issued a ""declaration of independence"" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on resource-rich Mindanao.

"United Nations (CNN) -- A new unpublished U.N. report claims North Korea continues to trade banned weapons technology with several countries, including Iran. The report, which was examined by CNN Monday, was compiled by a U.N. panel of experts looking into Security Council violations by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The report asserts that North Korea has ""continued to defy the bans on imports and exports of nuclear-related items, of conventional arms and of luxury goods."" In addition, the document says that ""the panel has discovered loopholes and other vulnerabilities in shipping and transportation practices that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and others have exploited."" One of those trading partners in weaponry and technology, according to the report, is the Islamic Republic of Iran. The panel of experts found ""prohibited ballistic missile-related items are suspected to have been transferred"" between North Korea and Iran ""on regular scheduled flights of Air Koryo and Iran Air."" The North Koreans have also used cargo flights and handling because such flights ""lack the kind of monitoring and security to which passenger terminals and flights are now subject."" North Korea was targeted with sanctions by the U.N. Security Council starting in 2006 after it had conducted several nuclear and ballistic tests over the years. The report detailed several examples of illicit arms or technology sales by North Korea that were stopped: . -- Thailand reported North Korean arms seized in December 2009 at Dom Muang Airport. The markings of crates suggested the 35 tons of arms were probably part of multiple shipments, possibly headed to Myanmar. -- The panel learned about weapons that would have been delivered to Burundi in October 2009 by a Ukrainian company, possibly by the same aircraft that was impounded two months later in Thailand from North Korea. -- Two states inspected a seized shipment containing propellant for use in Scud-type missiles en route from the North Korea to a Middle Eastern country that diplomats identified to CNN as Iran. Calls seeking comment from the North Korean mission at the United Nations were not immediately returned.","North Korea is doing deals in banned weapons with Iran and others, a U.N. report says .

"(CNN) -- It might be hard to believe, but as difficult as cancer was, in some ways it was good for me. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Even the word ""cancer"" brings back the nausea and pain, the fear I felt and the heartbreak I saw in my parents' faces. The smells that fill hospitals and the constant tired feeling that comes with treatment are also permanently stuck in my memory. But here's the thing: The disease changed the path of my life in some ways that have been really great. For one, going home after my diagnosis for treatment at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle brought me even closer to my parents. I always knew they'd be there for me, but I understood their love in a whole new way once I saw how they cared for me during treatment. When I was called up by the Red Sox I thought I'd always be the one who would be taking care of them, but cancer turned the tables for a bit. They were amazing in my recovery, and we're closer today than perhaps we would have been had I not gotten sick. When I recovered, the Red Sox told me I was going to head to Greenville, South Carolina, to get back in major league shape. Honestly, I wasn't happy. Once you make the majors it's never a great feeling to go back to the minors -- no matter what the circumstances. But I met an amazing young woman named Farrah Johnson there, and today she is my wife and (the best) mom to our son, Hudson. Who knows if I would have met her -- the love of my life -- if I had not had cancer? When I hit the five-year cancer-free mark in 2011, two things happened: Farrah gave birth to our son and my dad was diagnosed with cancer. Thankfully, Dad is doing fine, but these life events caused me to think about how I should be giving back. I couldn't help thinking of how I would feel if Hudson had to go through what I or my dad had to deal with fighting cancer. I had visited hospitals on Red Sox trips and met a number of kids battling cancer. I knew from speaking with them that my experience mattered to these kids and that the words of encouragement helped. Together with Farrah, we decided pediatric cancer research would be our cause and our mantra would be never quit. NVRQT, or ""Never Quit,"" is both a campaign that supports kids in the fight against cancer and funds much needed research. NVRQT is embossed on baseballs that can be signed, played with and given to a boy or girl battling cancer. They send the message to stick with it and get better because there are a whole bunch of people waiting for them to get back onto the field. The funds we raise support the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation. In addition to the balls, we're encouraging people to hold NVRQT games in their community to support the children in their area and raise funds for research. As I travel the country for away games, I meet kids fighting cancer in almost every city. They visit the ballpark, and I invite them onto the field so we can chat and then watch the game. I hope the little things I'm doing really make a difference to the kids in the battle today and the big fundraising events we're holding will minimize or cure pediatric cancer for the kids tomorrow. I'm proud to do my part to make a difference, and I know I have cancer to thank for my inspiration.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Monday approved an agreement granting Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, permanent custody of his children. Katherine Jackson has accused the executors of her son Michael's estate of ""keeping her in the dark."" A hearing is scheduled for October to look at some remaining issues. An agreement between Katherine Jackson, 79, and Debbie Rowe, mother of Jackson's two eldest children, cleared the way for an uncontested custody hearing. Rowe, who was briefly married to Michael Jackson, agreed not to fight for custody in exchange for visits with the children. Katherine Jackson was in the courtroom along with her daughters LaToya and Rebbie and a son, Randy. Rowe did not attend Monday's hearing, but her attorney, Eric George, spoke briefly outside the courthouse. ""She's faced difficulties and pressures none of us know, and today's agreement shows that she responded with heart, integrity and selflessness,"" George said of Rowe. He also praised Katherine Jackson's attorneys for their part in bringing about the agreement. Michael Jackson's two oldest children -- Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., 12, and Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, 11 -- signed consents to the agreement. He also has a 7-year-old son, Michael Joseph Jackson II, known as Blanket, with an unidentified surrogate. The custody agreement does not involve any financial payments to Rowe ""apart from the continuation of spousal support payments"" that Michael Jackson personally agreed to make to Rowe after the divorce, their lawyers said in a joint statement.  Watch Rowe's attorney talk about the decision » . Jackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her Encino, California, home since their father's death June 25. Also at the hearing Monday, attorneys for Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, said he sought a role in the children's lives and wanted ""in some way to be involved"" in respect to their education and medical care, although he was not objecting to the custody agreement. But Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff denied Klein's request to be a party to the hearing. Details of how the children were conceived and who was the biological father have been closely guarded amid much public speculation. In an interview last month on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Klein did not rule out being the biological father of the children. ""Not to the best of my knowledge,"" he said when asked by Diane Sawyer whether he was the father. ""All I can tell you is, best of my knowledge, I am not the father of these children. But I am telling you, if push comes to shove, I can't say anything."" Asked about Klein's attorneys saying he wants a role in the children's lives, George declined comment. Klein was not in the hearing Monday. Rowe and Jackson divorced in 1999, with Rowe giving him full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support. Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court ruled that her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door for a possible custody battle. On Monday, Beckloff awarded Katherine Jackson all of the family allowance funds she requested but gave only 83.5 percent of what she requested in support of the children. He said he disallowed money for one item, which he described as ""quite a large amount"" that he was not sure was necessary. The allowance order is sealed. Beckloff set a hearing to revisit the allowance matter in January. Also Monday, Beckloff ordered Katherine Jackson be given copies of her son's contracts in connection with a series of concerts that had been scheduled for this summer. She sought the contracts between Michael Jackson and AEG, the company that was organizing and promoting the concerts, along with others involved in the tour. She has agreed to keep the contract provisions confidential. Sharing of the contracts was a major point of contention between Katherine Jackson and the two men who control her son's estate: John Branca, Michael Jackson's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend. Branca's attorney argued in a court filing that his client had no choice but to request confidentiality from Katherine Jackson, since the contracts have a provision keeping them confidential. Katherine Jackson has also challenged the two men named as executors of her son's will. However, Beckloff did not rule on that matter Monday, saying he would like attorneys for the two sides to attempt to reach a resolution on their own. The attorneys conferred on the estate dispute during a morning recess that stretched to more than 90 minutes without reaching an agreement. Lawyers for Branca and McClain suggested Beckloff appoint them as executors of the will, but Beckloff instead extended their appointment as special administrators of Jackson's estate for another 60 days while he considers Katherine Jackson's objections. ""We believe the judge did the right thing,"" Branca's attorney, Howard Weitzman, told reporters after the hearing. ""We're quite pleased that the judge did what was appropriate."" He took no questions. During Monday's hearing, Beckloff asked one of her attorneys, Burt Levitch, if there was any objection to admitting the will for probate -- without deciding who its executors will be. Beckloff noted that no one has come forward to object to the terms of the will itself. Levitch agreed, and Beckloff officially admitted the will for probate. The action starts a 120-day clock running for the will to be probated. The will, written in 2002, places all of Michael Jackson's assets into a family trust benefiting his mother, his three children and unnamed charities. Katherine Jackson's attorneys filed a petition last week accusing the men who now control the estate of being ""intent on keeping her in the dark"" about deals they've made or are negotiating. Londell McMillan, Jackson's lead attorney, raised questions about ""a suspicious circle of relationships"" involving Branca and McClain. Katherine Jackson is asking the judge to order Branca, McClain and others to answer questions under oath about their business agreements to determine if they are ""fit and able"" to administer the estate. The men also were served with a 19-page demand for documents, including the AEG contracts. Branca's lawyers argued that Katherine Jackson's demand for documents is too broad and burdensome. But, McMillan said, ""such measures will not be necessary if Mrs. Jackson is appointed a co-executor of the estate."" Beckloff expressed concern, however, about delaying the appointment of executors for too long, since they must deal with any creditors to the estate that come forward. McMillan, in an interview with CBS Thursday, estimated the Jackson estate was worth $2 billion, while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $500 million. The next hearings in the matter are scheduled for August 10 and August 28 to deal with safe harbor motions. Katherine Jackson wants Beckloff to set aside a provision in her son's will that anyone who challenges its terms can be dropped from the will.","Katherine Jackson named permanent guardian of Michael Jackson's kids .

"(CNN) -- On a small, floating piece of ice in the Beaufort Sea, several hundred miles north of Alaska, a group of scientists are documenting what some dub an ""Arctic meltdown."" According to climate scientists, the warming of the region is shrinking the polar ice cap at an alarming rate, reducing the permafrost layer and wreaking havoc on polar bears, arctic foxes and other indigenous wildlife in the region. What is bad for the animals, though, has been good for commerce. The recession of the sea ice and the reduction in permafrost -- combined with advances in technology -- have allowed access to oil, mineral and natural gas deposits that were previously trapped in the ice. The abundance of these valuable resources and the opportunity to exploit them has created a gold rush-like scramble in the high north, with fierce competition to determine which countries have the right to access the riches of the Arctic. This competition has brought in its wake a host of naval and military activities that the Arctic hasn't seen since the end of the Cold War. Now, one of the coldest places on Earth is heating up as nuclear submarines, Aegis-class frigates, strategic bombers and a new generation of icebreakers are resuming operations there. Just how much oil and natural gas is under the Arctic ice?  The Arctic is home to approximately 90 billion barrels of undiscovered but recoverable oil, according to a 2008 study by the U.S. Geological Survey. And preliminary estimates are that one-third of the world's natural gas may be harbored in the Arctic ice. But that's not all that's up for grabs. The Arctic also contains rich mineral deposits. Canada, which was not historically a diamond-producing nation, is now the third-largest diamond producer in the world. If the global warming trend continues as many scientists project it to, it is likely that more and more resources will be discovered as the ice melts further. Who are the countries competing for resources?  The United States, Canada, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and Finland all stake a claim to a portion of the Arctic. These countries make up the Arctic Council, a diplomatic forum designed to mediate disputes on Arctic issues . Lawson Brigham, a professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and an Arctic expert, says ""cooperation in the Arctic has never been higher."" But like the oil trapped on the Arctic sea floor, much of the activity of the Arctic Council is happening below the surface. In secret diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks, Danish Foreign Minister Per Stieg Moeller was quoted as saying to the United States, ""If you stay out, the rest of us will have more to carve up the Arctic."" At the root of Moeller's statement is a dispute over control of territories that is pitting friend against foe and against friend. Canada and the U.S., strategic allies in NATO and Afghanistan, are in a diplomatic dispute over the Northwest Passage. Canada and Russia have recently signed development agreements together. In the same way a compass goes awry approaching the North Pole, traditional strategic alliances are impacted at the top of the world. Who owns the rights to the resources?  Right now, the most far-reaching legal document is the U.N. Convention on Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS. All of the Arctic states are using its language to assert their claims. The Law of the Sea was initially designed to govern issues like fishing rights, granting nations an exclusive economic zone 200 miles off their coasts. But in the undefined, changing and overlapping territory of the Arctic, the Law of the Sea becomes an imperfect guide, and there are disputes over who owns what. One example is the Lomonosov Ridge, which Canada, Denmark and Russia all claim is within their territory, based on their cartographic interpretations. Also complicating matters is the fact that the U.S. has never ratified the Law of the Sea. That has given other Arctic Council nations more muscle to assert territorial rights. So what's next?  With murky international agreements and an absence of clear legal authority, countries are preaching cooperation but preparing for conflict. There has been a flurry of new military activity reminiscent of days past. Two U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarines, the SSN Connecticut and the SSN New Hampshire, recently finished conducting ice exercises in the Arctic. Secretary of the Navy Richard Mabus said the purpose of the recent naval exercises was ""to do operational and war-fighting capabilities. Places are becoming open that have been ice-bound for literally millennia. You're going to see more and more of the world's attention pointed towards the Arctic."" Other Arctic nations are ramping up their military capabilities as well. Just this month, Russia announced that it is deploying two brigades to the Arctic, including a special forces unit. The Russian air force has recently resumed strategic bomber flights over the Pole. Canada, Denmark and Norway are also rapidly rebuilding their military presence. But despite the buildup, almost all of the activity in the Arctic has been within the scope of normal military operations or research. Have we seen this before?  There is a long precedent for countries using the Arctic to demonstrate military primacy. On April 25, 1958, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine -- the USS Nautilus (SSN 571) -- began Operation Sunshine, the first undersea transpolar crossing. Done on the heels of the Sputnik satellite launch, it was a demonstration that the U.S. could go places that its Cold War nemesis could not. For the next three decades, U.S. and Soviet submarines would continue to use the Arctic as a proving ground for military prowess. With the end of the Cold War, that activity waned. But in 2007, a Russian expedition planted a flag on the bottom of the polar sea floor, almost 14,000 feet below the surface. This ""neo-Sputnik"" has brought renewed interest to the Arctic and launched a flurry of activity -- scientific, economic and military -- that is eerily parallel to the decades of tension between the superpowers. The Cold War may be over, but the dethawing of military activity means that the frigid Arctic is once again becoming a hot spot.","Tension is building in the Arctic, where countries are vying for valuable natural resources .
More oil, natural gas and mineral deposits can be accessed now because of climate change .
There have been territorial disputes over the underwater land where these deposits rest .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two medical helicopter crashes in eight hours on Wednesday are again drawing attention to the dangers of aircraft that are intended to save lives. In one crash, all three people on a Med-Trans helicopter died when the aircraft crashed in a field near Ventura, Iowa, Wednesday evening. The chopper had been en route to pick up a patient at an Emmetsburg, Iowa, hospital, authorities said. Earlier in the day, an Air Methods helicopter crash landed near Seminole, Oklahoma, injuring the four crew members on board. There was no patient on the aircraft. Federal safety officials began a concerted effort to address medical aircraft safety in 2006 after an increase in the number of accidents around the country. Fifty-five medical aircraft crashed between January 2002 and January 2005, resulting in 54 fatalities and 18 serious injuries. But problems have continued. Sixteen people died in medical aircraft crashes in 2010, another three in 2011, and three last year, according to records released by the National Transportation Safety Board. Officials say the pressure to quickly respond in various conditions -- at night, in foul weather -- makes these operations inherently dangerous. Wednesday's fatal in Iowa crash occurred as a helicopter for Mercy Medical Center, operated by Med-Trans, went down about 9 p.m. The dead were identified as nurse Shelly Lair-Langenbau, paramedic Russell Piehl, and pilot Gene Grell with Med-Trans. ""They were each selfless health care professionals devoted to the delivery of emergency medical care,"" Dan Varnum, president of Mercy North Iowa, said in a statement. Authorities said that the helicopter did not issue a Mayday warning and that it is too early to know the cause of the crash. It is not known whether weather was a factor, but Cerro Gordo County Sheriff Kevin Pals told CNN that the blacktop road was ice-covered when he arrived at the scene about 20 minutes after the crash. Both the Federal Aviation Administration and the NTSB are investigating. According to an NTSB database, Med-Trans helicopters were involved in two nonfatal crashes in 2012. In both cases, the helicopters sustained substantial damage. The Dallas-based company operates about 60 aircraft at bases in 18 states, according to its website. The Oklahoma crash involved a helicopter built in 2009 and operated by the company Air Methods. ""The pilot stated he experienced an engine failure and looked for an open area to land,"" Lt. George Brown, a spokesman with the state's Highway Patrol, told CNN. The tail rotor and other parts of the tail broke away from the rest of the aircraft in the crash. Air Methods Vice President of Corporate Development Craig Yale said he couldn't comment on the circumstances of the crash because of the active investigation but said all of the injured were stable and some had been released from the hospital. NTSB records show the company has been involved in 12 other helicopter accidents, which included 20 deaths, since 2007. Yale attributed the total to the high number of flights they operate and noted that four of the deaths were on another company's helicopter involved in a midair collision. Air Methods has a dramatically lower rate of fatalities than the rest of the industry, he said, but it operates about half of the medical flights in the United States. The company has more than 400 aircraft and operates in 48 states, according to its website. ""Air Methods has invested $100 million in safety enhancements, (including) night vision goggles, terrain avoidance systems and weather systems in the aircraft,"" Yale added. The company also participates in an FAA Safety Management System. Police helicopters collide in California .

"(CNN) -- The 129 inmates who escaped from a northern Mexico prison did not flee through a tunnel, as authorities first reported. They walked out the front door. Federal and local authorities launched a manhunt after the inmates escaped Monday in Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas. Authorities arrested 16 employees, including the prison director, after the escape. Politician Manlio Fabio Beltrones said the prison break highlights a larger issue in Mexico. ""The crisis in the Mexican prison system is serious and must be addressed urgently,"" Beltrones said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon condemned the escape, calling it ""deplorable"" in a series of Twitter posts Tuesday. ""In the past six years, more than 1,000 inmates have escaped from state prisons. From the federal prisons, not one,"" he wrote. The largest escape during Calderon's six-year term occurred in December 2010, when 151 inmates escaped from a local prison in the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo. In February, 30 inmates fled after a riot in a prison in Monterrey, Mexico. Authorities originally said the inmates in the latest escape slipped through a 23-foot tunnel, sliced through a chain-link fence and ran through an empty lot. But they released new information saying the inmates went through the front door. ""It is hard to believe that they went through that tunnel,"" said Jose Luis Moran, the public safety secretary for the Mexican state of Coahuila. Officials originally said that 132 inmates had escaped but adjusted the figure to 129 after finding three inmates hiding in another part of the prison. Police set up blockades on roads leading to the Mexico-U.S. border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection placed its officers and agents in the area on alert, a homeland security official said. ""At this point, CBP has no reports of escapees attempting to cross the border. We will continue coordinating with our Mexican counterparts as we monitor this situation,"" the source said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Alternative treatments are as varied as the regions of the world they come from. And while they attract skepticism from some Western medical practitioners, they are an undeniable part of global health. Shark cartilage is a popular dish in Japan where it is regarded as having health benefits. In parts of Asia and Africa, 80 percent of the population depend on these treatments as their primary form of healthcare. Shark fin has long been used in traditional Asian medicine. Shark fin soup is regarded as a tonic that promotes general well-being, and shark fin has even been claimed to have anti-cancer properties. Shark fins are mainly composed of cartilage, a type of connective tissue found in the skeletal systems of many animals. In Japan, they are sold by herbalists as a powder, in tablet form or as whole fins. While shark fin has been used for centuries in Asia, in recent years it has become more popular in the West. A book called ""Sharks Don't Get Cancer,"" published in 1992, popularized the idea of shark fin as an alternative cancer treatment in the West, and powdered shark fin is now sold as dietary supplement. But scientific evidence doesn't support the idea. A 2000 report by researchers at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington D.C. said more than 40 tumors had been documented in sharks, skates and rays. Clinical studies on cancer patients, including a 1998 study by the Independent Cancer Treatment Research Foundation in Illinois, haven't shown cartilage powders to have any anti-cancer benefits. Cancer Research UK, an independent cancer-research organization, states ""We don't recommend alternative therapies such as shark cartilage, as there is no scientific or medical evidence to back up the claims made for these 'treatments'."" The use of shark fins has also been criticized by environmentalists who say the practice is threatening shark populations. In addition, environmental groups say that fins are often cut off live sharks at sea, with the bodies thrown back in the sea to drown, a controversial practiced know as ""finning."" The ancient art of herbal healing also remains highly popular in Africa. In South Africa, the name given to the practice is muti. In Johannesburg's Faraday market muti practitioners sell wares that are popular with locals and tourists alike. Illnesses are diagnosed by ""sangomas,"" who employ techniques including communicating with the spirits of ancestors. ""Sangomas"" then refer their patients to ""inyangas,"" who supply muti treatments. ""Inyangas"" make use of South Africa's diverse flora and fauna, selling treatments made from herbs and animal parts. Roots, bark and leaves are all used to prepare infusions that are said to cure ailments ranging from headaches to skin rashes. Other muti medicines deal with psychological conditions, curing nightmares, bringing good luck and warding off evil spells. Acupuncture is one of the most widespread of all traditional treatments. An ancient Chinese healing technique thought to date back at least 2,000 years, acupuncture is now widely practiced alongside modern medicine in the East and West alike. Traditional acupuncture works on the idea that energy, known as ""qi,"" flows along pathways in the body, called meridians. According to acupuncture theory, if these meridians become blocked, ""qi"" cannot flow freely and illness can result. Diagnosis of ailments is carried out by, among other things, feeling a patient's pulse and inspecting their tongue. Marian Rose of the British Acupuncture Council told CNN that an important part of the diagnosis process involves asking patients a range of questions about their well-being, including their digestion, sleep patterns, and health history. Treatment involves inserting fine acupuncture needles at critical points in the body in order to stimulate the flow of ""qi,"" described by Rose as ""the body's motivating energy."" Traditionally, acupuncture can be used to treat headaches, chronic pain, asthma, depression, addiction, and problems with the digestive system. Acupuncture has been the subject of extensive research and in the West the practice has been studied in terms of modern medical knowledge. Dr Mike Cummings is the medical director of the British Medical Acupuncture Association, which promotes Western medical acupuncture. He told CNN that research has shown acupuncture to be effective at treating pain in particular. Cummings says that it is believed that when an acupuncture needle is inserted into a muscle, it stimulates nerves. That affects the spinal gate, where sensory input is modulated, reducing activity in pain pathways. Whether backed by medical science or simply by years of use, traditional treatments remain popular and as more research is carried out, some may even come to complement modern medicine.","Even in the era of modern medicine, traditional treatments are still widespread .

"(CNN) -- Leading Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan says he was detained for nearly two hours Friday night at New Jersey's Newark International Airport because of his last name. Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan said he was detained by authorities at the Newark, New Jersey, airport. In an interview with CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, Khan said immigration officials at the airport detained him for questioning after they said his name was flagged. ""They kept on telling me that my name is common to some name that has popped up on the computer, so they need to follow procedure,"" he said. ""It took them an hour and a half, two hours; they kept on asking me questions, if I could give them any ... numbers in America that they can contact and vouch for me and who I am."" A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said the agency could not comment on specific incidents. ""I was really taken aback because there were people who knew me there,"" Khan told CNN-IBN, referring to other travelers who were nearby. Rajeev Shukla, the secretary of India's ruling Congress party and a friend of Khan's, told CNN that the actor called him from Newark, as well as Khan's secretary and family. Shukla said Khan, who was en route to Chicago, Illinois, was allowed to leave after Indian Embassy officials intervened. In New Delhi, India, U.S. Ambassador Timothy Roemer issued a statement describing Khan as a ""very welcome guest"" in the United States and a ""global icon."" ""Many Americans love his films,"" Roemer said. ""We are trying to ascertain the facts of the case -- to understand what took place."" The Indian government said in a written statement that it understood that Khan had been ""taken aside for 'secondary questioning'"" at Newark airport. ""The consulate general of India got in touch with him immediately upon learning about the incident,"" the statement said. ""Mr. Khan said that he was all right. The consulate offered him any assistance that he may require."" The government said it has taken up the matter with the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.

"New York (CNN) -- A Bronx Supreme Court Judge dismissed on Wednesday the manslaughter indictment against New York Police Officer Richard Haste, who fatally shot an unarmed teenager in 2012. Judge Steven Barrett threw out the case based on instructions given by the prosecution to the grand jury regarding communications among officers before the shooting, attorneys on both sides of the case confirmed. ""The whole defense against Officer Haste is, what his state of mind was prior to discharging his weapon one time,"" said Stuart London, Haste's attorney. The original indictment alleges that Haste acted ""recklessly"" and ultimately killed 18-year-old Ramarley Graham while ""acting with intent to cause serious physical injury ... by shooting him."" ""Officer Haste's actions were formulated by information given by other officers at the scene who said the individual he was chasing was armed,"" London said. ""So his state of mind was, this person is dangerous."" In dismissing the case against Haste, Barrett said: ""In effect the grand jury was told, by both commission and omission, that the communications of the other officers to Officer Haste were not relevant. That's my conclusion in reading this instruction, and that is error,"" CNN affiliate NY1 reported. ""My ruling does not end this case,"" the judge added. After Barrett read his decision, Constance Malcolm, Graham's mother, yelled, ""He killed my child!"" ""It cannot be said more forcefully that we disagree with the court,"" a statement issued by the Bronx District Attorney's Office said. The district attorney's office will now decide whether it will appeal this decision or present the case to the grand jury again. ""This is a long road and we are certainly gratified that the system is fair,"" London said. ""We are ready to testify again, if the district attorney chooses to represent to the jury, because Officer Haste feels justified in his actions."" The charges against Haste stemmed from an incident in the Bronx on February 2, 2012, when, police say, investigators observed a young man now believed to be Graham acting suspiciously. When police approached, they say, the man fled, eventually running into a three-family home. Police say investigators pursued the young man into his house, where a struggle occurred. Haste fired one shot and hit Graham in the chest as he barricaded himself in the bathroom. Graham's family said he was shot as his grandmother and his 6-year-old brother looked on.","Judge throws out manslaughter indictment against NYPD Officer Richard Haste .

"(CNN) -- Everything was going fine, until the bill came. But it wasn't the amount on the check that angered Joseph Gibson, who had stopped at a St. Louis sports bar to chow down. It was a line on the special order section for his young son that set him off. Under ""1 -- Wing Sauce"" the receipt read: ""F---in Needy Kids."" The name of the bar? Friendly's. Denny Domachowski, the general manager of Friendly's Sports Bar and Grill, told CNN the waitress meant it as a joke and intended to delete it before handing the bill to Gibson. She's been reprimanded, he said. ""I apologized to them, and he called later and I apologized again,"" Domachowski said. Gibson, who had a soda and chicken dinner, was still offended. Snarky quip, no tip: Receipt goes viral . He posted a picture of the receipt to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Facebook page. He wrote that he was upset by the explanation that it was just a joke among co-workers. ""So customers with children are a joke? This place isn't so friendly. I got nowhere with management,"" he wrote. Domachowski explained that he made a Father's Day exception for Gibson to bring in a child even though the bar was for patrons 21 and older. The restaurant has no children's menu so the waitress had to manually type in the boy's order of one chicken leg. ""The incident shouldn't have happened, and I made sure she understands that,"" he said. ""She didn't mean to offend the gentleman and his son. She had a good experience with them as customers. She was just in a hurry and forgot to take that off."" He added that he doesn't understand why Gibson is ""making a mountain of a mole hill."" But he conceded.

"Washington (CNN) -- After years of planning and months of campaigning, the most expensive presidential race in history comes down to a final five-day whirlwind of speeches and television ads in the eight states still up for grabs. President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney plan to hold virtually nonstop events between now and the Tuesday election considered too close to call. The focus is on battleground states worth 95 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Both sides are trying to close the deal with a dwindling number of uncommitted voters, while making sure supporters actually cast ballots. That means a game of campaign chess that started Thursday, with appearances by the candidates and their surrogates as well as advertising dollars allocated to the places considered most vital to success. Concluding a race expected to cost more than $6 billion overall, Obama and Romney and their running mates will hit all the battleground states -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin. The campaigns also are unloading a blast of television ads and mailings that threaten to overwhelm voters already saturated with politicking. Obama, Romney paths to victory cross in Iowa . Perhaps no one said it better than 4-year-old Abigael Evans of Fort Collins, Colorado, who -- according to NPR -- cried after listening to more election coverage on the radio and told her mother: ""I'm tired of Broncobama and Mitt Romney."" In a sign of the strategic maneuvering at hand, Romney surrogates and super-PACs supporting him are targeting two states considered likely to go for Obama -- Michigan and Pennsylvania. On Thursday, Romney' s campaign announced he will visit Pennsylvania on Sunday, a major commitment that signaled it believes he can win the Keystone State. His running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, will campaign in Pennsylvania on Saturday. According to Romney's team, both Pennsylvania and Michigan are in play due to what it calls a surge of momentum that emerged after the first presidential debate on October 3, which analysts and polls scored a solid victory for the former Massachusetts governor over a lackluster Obama. In response, the president's campaign pointed to his lead in polls in both states and argued the money and time spent in them by the Romney campaign amounts to a bluff to try to depict nonexistent momentum. Republican candidates claiming late momentum made a final push in Pennsylvania in the last five elections, and lost the state every time, according to the Obama team. At the same time, Obama's camp and supporting groups have devoted some new attention to both Pennsylvania and Michigan, which are crucial to the president's strategy for nailing down the electoral advantage. In an example of the advertising battle, a Romney campaign ad broadcast this week in Florida seeks to link Obama to Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Cuba's Fidel Castro -- leftist leaders reviled by much of the state's Cuban American population. The ad spotlights endorsements from Chavez and Mariela Castro, the niece of Fidel, who both said they would vote for Obama if they could. While non-Cuban Latinos overwhelmingly support Obama, according to polls, Romney and Republicans hold an advantage among more conservative Cuban-Americans. Another Romney ad released Thursday attacked Obama's suggestion in an interview with MSNBC that he would consider consolidating government agencies under a new ""secretary of business"" in a second term. The ad portrayed the comment as more big government, saying Obama's ""solution to everything is to add another bureaucrat."" Romney echoed the ad in his first stop Thursday in Virginia, ending a temporary cease-fire in direct political attacks this week due to Superstorm Sandy by saying, ""we don't need a secretary of business to understand business, we need a president who understands business and I do, and that's why I'll be able to get this economy going."" In America: Parallels to country's racist past haunt age of Obama . The Obama campaign, meanwhile, released new television and radio ads that featured the endorsement for the president by former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican. The ads to run in the battleground states, as well as North Carolina, include Powell supporting achievements of Obama's first term. Another Obama ad took aim at an earlier Romney spot that implied Chrysler was shifting Jeep manufacturing from the United States to China, a claim denied by the automaker. The Obama campaign said the ad will run in Michigan and Ohio, two big auto industry states. Both candidates sought to balance their campaign stump speeches between longstanding criticism of each other with positive messaging meant to inspire voters to choose them. The challenge is to pick up any remaining undecided voters while motivating all bona fide supporters to either cast votes early or head to the polls on Tuesday. For Obama, that means overcoming disappointment with continuing high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery during his presidency. ""These are the last five days of his last campaign -- ever,"" noted Obama campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki. ""So you will hear many of the themes, much about the fight that he's been waging throughout his ... career in public life on behalf of the middle class."" At his first stop Thursday in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the president told a cheering crowd on the airport tarmac that Romney is trying to sell failed Republican policies that helped cause the financial collapse of 2008 as forward progress. ""He is saying he is the candidate of change,"" Obama said. ""Well, let me tell you Wisconsin -- we know what change looks like and what the governor is offering sure ain't change."" Pointing to his own record of health care reform, Wall Street reform and other steps he said were intended to strengthen the middle class, the president told his supporters they know real change when they see it. Romney and Republicans were counting on the American people to be ""so worn down by all the squabbling, so tired of all the dysfunction that you will actually reward obstruction and put people back in charge who advocate the very policies that got us into this mess,"" Obama said. ""In other words, their bet is on cynicism,"" he added. ""But Wisconsin my bet is on you. My bet is on the decency and good sense of the American people because despite all the resistance, despite all the setbacks, we have won some great fights."" Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist and CNN contributor, said she expected similar attacks on Romney in the final days of the race. Poll shows Obama edge in Iowa, New Hampshire and Wisconsin . Referring to the Republican challenger, Cardona said ""the dissonance between what he is saying now, what he has said in the past, and what his policies will actually do is something that voters are going to continue to hear about from the Obama campaign and their surrogates, as they should."" Vice President Joe Biden followed that script Thursday, telling an Iowa crowd that Obama ""says what he means and he means what he says, and no one can say that about Gov. Romney."" Earlier, Romney told cheering, sign-waving supporters in Roanoke, Virginia, that Obama's policies have failed to bring the kind of economic growth the nation should be experiencing, asking if people wanted ""four more years like the last four years"" with high unemployment, trillion-dollar deficits and political gridlock in Washington. ""I know that the Obama folks are chanting four more years, four more years. But our chant is this -- five more days,"" he said. He also accused the Obama campaign of ""shrinking to smaller things"" through personal attacks against him. His speech included now familiar references to offering a new direction for the country in what has been a more positive and personal touch for a candidate considered aloof and wooden during the Republican primaries. ""It's exactly what he needs to do these last few days of the campaign -- get his base enthused, get them out to work,"" said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. ""It's all about the ground game right now."" While Romney has been unable to overtake Obama so far in most swing state polls, some of the polling data suggests the president could be vulnerable. For example, an NBCNews/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Thursday showed voters under 30 in New Hampshire -- an important demographic for the president -- were less enthusiastic about the election than older demographics that tend to be more supportive of Romney. Obama needs to repeat his strong support in 2008 from young voters as well as minority voters -- especially Latinos and African-Americans -- to win on Tuesday, and that means making sure the turnout on Election Day is as large as possible. Compounding the turnout issue are logistical problems along the East Coast due to the devastation by Sandy, and expected legal issues including tightened voter eligibility standards in some states that Democrats complain were intended to suppress the minority vote.

"(CNET)  -- General Electric plans to give its solar business a charge in two years with the introduction of panels with the same solar cell material used by industry cost leader First Solar. General Energy is developing a solar energy product aimed at utility and commercial customers. In 2011, the energy giant expects to produce solar panels made with cadmium telluride, a thin-film solar cell material, said Michael Idelchik, vice president of advanced technologies at GE Global Research at the EmTech conference here on Wednesday. The company now sells solar panels that use silicon solar cells, but its long-term bet is on thin-film and specifically cadmium telluride because it offers the cheapest cost per watt, he said. Last year, GE's energy division took a majority stake in Golden, Colorado-based PrimeStar Solar, for its cadmium telluride cell technology. GE is now developing a product around that aimed at utility and commercial customers. Solar at GE is a relatively small part of its sprawling energy portfolio, which covers everything from nuclear power plants to natural gas turbines. But GE expects that solar has the potential to grow rapidly, as its multi-billion dollar wind business has done over the past five years. ""Solar is definitely the next wind for us. It's not there yet but it's moving very rapidly,"" said Idelchik. Solar is more expensive than wind right now, but GE expects that renewable energy mandates will help drive growth and bring costs down, he said. Thin-film solar cells offer lower production costs than the incumbent silicon because thin-film cells use far less material. Over the past five years, several solar companies have formed to make thin-film cells from a combination copper, indium, gallium, and selenide (CIGS), which are still not in the market in high volumes. GE's cells will be made from a compound of cadmium and tellurium. Silicon cells are durable and more efficient at converting sunlight to electricity than thin-film solar cells with the most efficient commercial silicon cells over 20 percent. But GE Research projects that it can boost the efficiency of cadmium telluride to 12 percent and potentially higher, Idelchik said. ""We are excited about it because it can produce in diffuse light,"" he said. ""The module (panel) life is 20 years -- that's what the customer wants. It has the right production costs and right efficiency target."" Asked how its cadmium telluride products will differ from First Solar's, Idelchik said that GE's device would be more ""flexible for customers."" During his presentation, Idelchik said that GE is looking at ways at managing an entire solar array in a large installation built by a utility or commercial customer. After his talk, he said that GE is developing technology to recycle the solar cell material, as cadmium is a very toxic if it enters the environment. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Syrian rebels and an al-Qaeda-affiliated group have captured a government air base near the key city of Aleppo, an opposition group said. ""Early dawn today, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and some rebel battalions took full control of the Menagh air base,"" the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Tuesday. ""The start of this new offensive started yesterday when two non-Syrian nationals blew themselves up in an armored vehicle in front of the command center of the Menagh air base,"" the group added. The SOHR said one suicide bomber was a Saudi Arabian. Fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and various rebel battalions destroyed several tanks and killed a number of regime soldiers, the observatory said. At least 10 rebel fighters, including foreigners, were also killed, the group added . The Islamic State of Iraq is the rebranded name for al Qaeda in Iraq. The group changed its name after its founder, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed by a U.S. missile strike in 2006. The expanded term ""Islamic State of Iraq and Syria"" was spawned when the ISI moved into Syria. However, al Nusra Front -- a group inspired by al Qaeda that has fought alongside rebels in Syria -- has denied the existence of a merged group. The Menagh air base is north of Aleppo, Syria's largest city and financial hub. For many months, rebels have tried to wrest control of the city in their attempt to topple four decades of rule by President Bashar al-Assad's family. The Syrian regime downplayed reports that opposition fighters -- whom it calls ""terrorists"" -- had taken over Menagh air base. ""The heroes of our armed forces are confronting the terrorists with matchless valor,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. SANA said the airport is devoid of military equipment and aircraft and is not in service. Study shows rise of al Qaeda affiliate in Syria . Elsewhere, a car bomb exploded in Jarmana in southern Syria, killing 18 people, including three children, and wounding dozens more, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported Tuesday. CNN cannot independently confirm casualty tolls as the Syrian government has severely restricted the access of international journalists.

"(LifeWire) -- First comes love, then comes marriage -- or at least that's how the saying used to go. An increasing number of heterosexual couples have been shacking up without plans for a trip down the aisle. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are raising four children together. Pitt has said the couple won't consider marriage until same-sex couples have the right to wed. According to a 2003 U.S. Census Bureau report on families and living arrangements, 4.6 million U.S. households were occupied by unmarried couples of the opposite sex. That's up from 2.9 million in 1996. ""People don't question, 'Why did you get married?' They only ask you, 'Why haven't you gotten married?' "" points out Marion Willetts, an associate professor of sociology at Illinois State University. ""I think a lot of people feel if you were really serious about your partner and your relationship, then you'd get married."" But from what Willetts has found with the life partners she's spoken to, that is simply not true. ""They're in this for the long haul,"" she says. ""This isn't just some convenient thing or trial marriage. They're just as committed to their relationship as married people."" While Census data doesn't identify couples who have sworn off marriage, Willetts has followed this group in a study of 83 couples she's surveyed over the past few years for her current research, tentatively titled ""Union Quality Comparisons between Heterosexual Licensed Domestic Partners and the Legally Married."" According to her research, it's not just 20-something social idealists who decline to get married. Willetts has interviewed octogenarians in committed relationships who are not planning to tie the knot. In fact, according to a 2003 AARP survey of 3,500 single Americans aged 40-69, just eight percent cited finding someone to marry as their reason for dating, while 49 percent said they were looking for someone to talk with or do things with -- in other words, a companion. As the prevalence of unmarried couples rises, more companies and state and local governments are providing a range of domestic partner benefits. Some, like New York state, require that medical benefits be extended to both same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners, according to the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. Other states, like Illinois extend such benefits only to same-sex partners. Why do some couples opt for long-term companionship instead of legal marriage, like movie actors Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, who have been together since 1982? Alison Hatch, 30, a part-time instructor and doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Daniel Welch, 31, an elementary school teacher, cite reasons both social and political. ""We are philosophically opposed to marriage for a few reasons, but mostly because we do not feel as though we can in good conscience enter into an institution that actively discriminates against gay and lesbian couples,"" says Hatch, who has lived with Welch for four years. ""It is our belief that it is inherently discriminatory to grant social benefits to some couples and exclude others."" Actor Brad Pitt told Esquire magazine in October 2006 that he and actress Angelina Jolie -- with whom he is raising four children -- have declined to consider marriage until same-sex couples have the right to wed. Partners choose not to marry for other reasons. Hatch, whose dissertation examined 48 committed heterosexual couples choosing to not pursue legal marriage, has spoken to people who feel marriage is a patriarchal institution. Some are against the intertwining of church and state in marriage. There also are emotional reasons why committed couples choose to stay unwed. ""I think that a lot of people like the kind of organic nature that your relationship takes on when you decide not to marry,"" says Julie Bluhm, 31, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based clinical social worker and a board member of the Alternatives to Marriage Project, a national nonprofit organization advocating equality for unmarried people. ""It's almost a deeper appreciation of their relationship and the privacy of it."" Being unmarried was not necessarily an obstacle to parenting for a small group of couples in Willetts' research. In a study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family in November 2003, two of 23 couples Willetts surveyed had children biologically related to both partners, though several couples had children biologically related to one partner -- typically the result of a previous marriage. Of the two couples, one pair had been living together for over 15 years and did not encounter any legal issues concerning their children by not being married. Said Willetts, ""They expressed to me that everyone -- including their children's friends -- had just assumed they were legally married anyway."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- It's a thrill for me as a fisherman to see a wild Alaskan silver salmon jump out of the water with my fly in his mouth. And it's an even greater thrill for me as a father to see my eldest son guide his old man and his little brother into a honey hole full of salmon on a remote Alaskan river. I experienced both of those thrills this summer, as you can see from the mile-wide grin on my face in this picture. For three generations my family has come to Alaska to chase wild salmon. The Chinook, the Sockeye, the Coho, the Chum and the Humpback are graceful, powerful beauties with an unerring GPS for home. They're also tasty -- and among the healthiest sources of protein you can find. Wild salmon (the ultimate free-range meat) is high in healthful Omega 3 fatty acids, and has been found to prevent heart disease and diabetes in Native Alaskans -- even those who are obese. No wonder First Alaskans have been happily harvesting salmon for at least 40 centuries. Of course, humans aren't the only species who know the joy of salmon. I have had the humble honor of sharing an Alaskan stream with a bevy of Brown Bears. Without my expensive waders or flyrod, lacking even polarized sunglasses, they out-fish me every time. I have seen eagles -- mammoth golden eagles and majestic bald eagles, dive-bomb rivers to pick off smaller salmon, and choruses of cacophonous sea gulls scavenge salmon carcasses on a riverbank. And I caught the biggest rainbow trout of my life in Alaska, where the species thrives on salmon eggs. Salmon is the focal point of so much of the economy in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. Salmon contribute $1.5 billion annually and 14,000 jobs to the region's economy. For good reason, the Chinook Salmon is the state fish of Alaska. And yet this magnificent, abundant, nutritious, valuable resource is threatened. A partnership between two companies -- London-based Anglo American, which has a spotty environmental record and Vancouver-based Northern Dynasty -- wants to build one of the world's largest mines to extract copper, gold and molybdenum at the headwaters of two of the most significant rivers in Bristol Bay. Anglo American says it is committed to a goal of minimizing ""any impact to the local environment by designing, operating and closing all of our operations in an environmentally responsible manner."" But the mammoth Pebble Mine would, according to an exhaustive review conducted by the EPA, destroy up to 90 miles of streams and as much as nearly 5,000 acres of wetlands right smack-dab in the middle of one of the largest, most productive and most valuable sockeye fisheries on earth. The Wild Salmon Center and Trout Unlimited have looked at this proposal as well. The destruction they foresee is biblical: up to 10.8 billion tons of rock waste. If you were to load all that waste onto train cars, the train would stretch to the moon...five times. The mine would require 9 miles of dams, some of them taller than the Washington Monument. God forbid one of them failed in earthquake-prone Alaska. ""The problem with Pebble is its size, type and location,"" said Tim Bristol of Trout Unlimited. Bristol notes that the mine would be far bigger than all the other mines in Alaska combined, digging down nearly a mile into the earth straddling the two major drainages of Bristol Bay, the Nushagak and Kvichak, two of the world's greatest producers of sockeye and Chinook salmon. The ore body itself contains a huge amount of acid-generating waste rock. ""Imagine a lake of dilute sulfuric acid,"" he says, making my skin crawl. ""A sulfuric lake that must be contained and monitored essentially forever. And this would be happening in one of the more seismically active places anywhere. It's the last place to mine not the first."" To be sure, there are other voices in the debate. The Washington Post editorial board, has hypothesized that the mining companies ""can, for example, build extremely high and strong tailings dams, engineering the whole project beyond what standard industry practices would dictate."" And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the powerful lobby for big business, has mocked the EPA's dire warning, saying the agency has let its imagination run wild. Still, a clear majority of Alaskans said they opposed Pebble Mine in a poll sponsored by the Bristol Bay Native Corporation, which represents more than 9,000 Eskimio, Aleut, and Athabascans with ancestral ties to Bristol Bay. Perhaps Alaskans see this as a situation in which a handful of business people with un-calloused hands and expensive suits get the gold mine, but Alaskans get the shaft. All so some corporate consortium can sell more copper and gold to the Chinese. Fortunately, under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has the authority to stop the devastation before it's too late. All they have to do is use it. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA can block the mine if it would have an ""unacceptable adverse impact"" on (among other things) ""fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife or recreational areas."" EPA should use the power Congress gave it to protect Bristol Bay. The stakes are historic. Just as Teddy Roosevelt is remembered for saving Yellowstone, President Obama and his new EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy can go down in history as the visionary leaders who saved the salmon. Even if you have never heard a fishing reel sing as line is stripped out by a wild salmon; even if you've never heard your child scream ""Fish on!""; if you've never felt the pull of a fighting fish or even tasted succulent fresh Alaskan salmon, you have a stake in stopping Pebble Mine. An environmental stake, an economic stake, a moral stake. Years ago my father shook his head and grinned as I stood in chest-deep water in 39-degree weather and caught my first Alaskan salmon on a fly in the driving rain. This summer it was my turn for my heart to swell with parental pride as my sons out-fished me in Alaska. So I feel a special obligation to ensure that magnificent habitat is around for their children and grandchildren and on and on for another 4,000 years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Paul Begala says Alaska boasts a pristine salmon fishing region .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the accused Fort Hood gunman, is paralyzed from the waist down, his lawyer said Friday. ""It appears he won't be able to walk in the future,"" said Hasan's civilian attorney, retired Army Col. John Galligan. Hasan also has severe pain in his hands, the attorney said. Authorities say Hasan, a U.S. Army psychiatrist, opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood on November 5, killing 13 people. Two civilian officers engaged Hasan, wounding him. One officer was wounded. Two heroes emerge in shooting . Army officials announced Thursday that Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder, making him eligible for the death penalty. Galligan said he spent an hour Thursday with Hasan at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, where he is being treated. A family member whom he did not identify was also present during the hourlong meeting. As investigators explore what may have led to the shooting rampage, the U.S. State Department's top counterterrorism official said Thursday there appears to be no operational link between Hasan and any outside group, citing investigators who looked into Hasan's communications with a radical Islamic cleric. Daniel Benjamin, the department's counterterrorism coordinator, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Hasan and Imam Anwar al-Awlaki had communicated through e-mails, but their content raised no red flags to investigators. Watch Amanpour, Benjamin discuss the case . ""I believe that the various investigating bureaus have said that they have seen these e-mail messages to a radical cleric, but that they were not a sufficient concern to open up an investigation, and there doesn't appear to be any linkage to any outside group in terms of the operation itself,"" Benjamin said in his first television interview since taking up his post. Counterterrorism investigators monitoring al-Awlaki came across the e-mails with Hasan during their investigation last year. In a separate development, President Obama ordered an immediate inventory and review of intelligence related to the shooting and Hasan, and whether information was properly shared between government agencies. Those who knew Hasan before he was a major in the Army say he was long known for militant Islamist views. Doctors who crossed paths with Hasan in medical programs paint a picture of a subpar student who wore his religious views on his sleeve. Several doctors who knew Hasan spoke to CNN, but only on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. Hasan ""was clearly espousing Islamist ideology"" during his time as a medical student at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, one of his former classmates said. After the shooting, Hasan's family revealed little about him, saying in media interviews that Hasan was a ""good American"" and a lifelong Muslim who complained that he was harassed in the Army because of his religion. His former classmates describe a much more militant man. His presentations for school were often laced with extremist Muslim views, one source said. ""Is your allegiance to Sharia [Islamic] law or the United States?"" students once challenged Hasan, the source said. ""Sharia law,"" the source says Hasan responded. The incident was corroborated by another doctor who was present. The source also recalled an instance in which Hasan was asked if the U.S. Constitution was a brilliant document, to which Hasan replied, ""No, not particularly."" The former classmate told CNN that he voiced concerns about Hasan to supervisors at the school. A second former medical school colleague of Hasan said that several people raised concerns about Hasan's overall competence. Even though Hasan earned his medical degree and residency, some of his fellow students believed that he ""didn't have the intellect"" to be in the program and was not academically rigorous in his coursework. Hasan ""was not fit to be in the military, let alone in the mental health profession,"" this classmate told CNN. ""No one in class would ever have referred a patient to him, or trusted him with anything."" The first classmate echoed this sentiment. Hasan was ""coddled, accommodated and pushed through that masters of public health despite substandard performance,"" the classmate said. He was ""put in the fellowship program because they didn't know what to do with him."" The second classmate said he witnessed at least two of Hasan's PowerPoint discussions that included what he described as extremist views. In these presentations, which were supposed to be about health, the source said that Hasan justified suicide bombings and spoke about the persecution of Muslims in the Middle East, in the United States and in the U.S. military. Some in the crowd rolled their eyes or muttered under their breath, he said, and others were clearly uncomfortable. Those in the audience, which included program supervisors, did not loudly object to Hasan's presentations, but did complain to their higher-ups afterward. The supervisors expressed ""appreciation, understanding and agreement"" that the complaints would be discussed, but the source said it was unclear what action, if any, came. Despite the controversy that his schoolwork created, classmates did not view Hasan as mentally unstable or psychotic, the source said. Questions remain over how much Hasan's behavior and actions in school were reflected in his personnel files. Col. Kimberly Kesling, deputy commander of clinical services for Darnell Medical Center at Fort Hood and Hasan's supervisor at the post, told reporters last week that Hasan was doing a good job in Texas. ""As a supervisor, I am aware of the job performance of people coming into our organization, that is part of our credentialing process,"" Kesling said. ""The types of things that were reported to me via his evaluation report were things that concerned me, but did not raise red flags toward this [the shootings] in any way, shape or form."" ""His evaluation reports said that he had some difficulties in his residency, fitting into his residency, and we worked very hard to integrate him into our practice and into our organization, and he adapted very well, was doing a really good job for us,"" she said. Prompted by reports of former classmates, however, Army investigators would like to speak with people who have had contact with Hasan over the years and who may have information about his activities and behavior, said Maj. Gen Kevin Bergner, head of U.S. Army public affairs. And Defense Secretary Robert Gates weighed in on the bits and pieces of information surfacing about Hasan. ""I deplore the leaks that have taken place,"" he said on a trip to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. People are talking about ""what they know, which is one small piece of the puzzle."" ""They don't know whether or not what they're leaking might jeopardize a potential criminal investigation and trial,"" he said. Hasan came under investigation when his contacts with al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric's communications, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. An employee of the Defense Department's Criminal Investigative Services, assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, ultimately decided to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan's personnel files.

"(CNN) -- The less-than-confrontational comments coming from new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani are not what the West is used to hearing from that country's office in recent years. Rouhani, a cleric and moderate politician elected in June, has signaled his desire for better engagement with the West, most recently in a Thursday Washington Post op-ed, in which he called for an end to ""the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart."" Coming a week before he's to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Rouhani's op-ed called for nations to work together on contentious issues such as Iran's nuclear program. And he offered to broker efforts to bring peace to Syria, a long-time Iranian ally torn by civil war. Given Iran's closeness to Syria's government, it seems unlikely rebels would consider Rouhani an independent broker. But Rouhani's tone is far less fiery than that of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. And Rouhani's promise of more positive engagement with the world during his election campaign appeared to propel him to victory. Rouhani, 65, enjoyed reformist backing and took more than 50% of the vote. Three of the six candidates were much more conservative, and the Iranian public viewed Rouhani as a mild alternative. But how just how conciliatory is Rouhani? Hassan Rouhani is Iran's next president . Hawk or dove? Rouhani has a reputation for avoiding extreme positions and bridging differences, but he is no pushover. He has a long history of service in the country's defense establishment. He is a former commander of the Iranian air defenses, is a leader on three war and defense councils, and was national security adviser to the president for 13 years before Ahmadinejad took office. Rouhani is also a diplomatic and legal intellectual. He has three law degrees, including a doctorate from a university in Scotland, and as president of Iran's strategic research center, he regularly publishes essays. He has served as managing editor for three quarterlies on scientific and strategic research, and foreign policy. He was also Iran's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, who later became one of the leading figures in Iran's rebellious ""Green Movement,"" which erupted into street protests after the re-election of Ahmadinejad in 2009. Ahmadinejad's government violently quashed the protests with the help of elements of a unit of the Revolutionary Guard, which answers to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader. Rouhani has expressed support for the Green Movement. ""These were protests that were natural and popular,"" he has said. ""They should have been addressed."" After Green supporters chanted for him at a rally, security forces arrested members of his campaign. Relationship with Khamenei . Rouhani's relationship with Khamenei has the potential to be complex. He represented the supreme leader on Iran's security council for many years. But Rouhani has purportedly also suggested Khamenei is too rigid toward the international community, said Abbas Milani, who runs a research program on Iran at Stanford University. In a book about his experience as Iran's nuclear negotiator during Khatami's presidency, Rouhani criticizes Ayatollah Khamenei, according to Milani. ""If you read in between the lines, he places a lot of blame on Khamenei,"" Milani says. ""He says in his book that if it was up to him, he and his team would have come up with a solution that would not lead up to Iran's case being deferred to the U.N.-- saying 'we could have done this, and some people in Iran and some in the West torpedoed it."" A televised presidential debate turned into an animated political clash and touched on Iran's nuclear program. Exchanges grew so heated that the candidates were later accused of having revealed national secrets during the debate. Rouhani was warned that he could be barred from running in the elections because of confidential material he revealed about Iran's nuclear program during the two-hour-long debate. It wasn't his first testy moment with Iran's state-run media. He has openly accused it of censorship and publishing lies. Many believe Rouhani was not Khamenei's favorite candidate. But Khamenei has said he is not playing favorites and would not let on whom he voted for. And Khamenei and his Guardian Council had to approve all candidates before the race began. Out of 680 who applied to run, only eight were allowed to do so. Two later dropped out. Ultimately, the supreme leader approved Rouhani's candidacy after rejecting the candidacy of a former president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani endorsed Rouhani during his campaign. Rouhani is a senior cleric and still is a member of the Assembly of Experts, which is responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader. As Khamenei ages and the appointment of a successor becomes necessary, Rouhani will likely have influence on the choice.

"(CNN) -- Images of a sky-blue car, its windows shattered by bullets, took center stage Monday at the trial of reputed mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Bulger's onetime crime partner Kevin Weeks testified he was there the night Edward ""Brian"" Halloran was killed. He placed the gun squarely in Bulger's hands. ""Jim Bulger just kept shooting,"" said Weeks describing Halloran's writhing, bullet-ridden body as ""bouncing off the ground."" Halloran is one of 19 people Bulger is accused of killing during his 20-year reign of terror in South Boston. Bulger is on trial in federal court in Boston. Rogue FBI agents had alerted Bulger that Halloran was going to cooperate against Bulger in a couple of killings. Bulger imitates machine gun, talks about a killing in recorded jail visit . Weeks testified that on May 11, 1982, while Halloran was at the Mullins Club, Bulger pulled up in his souped-up 1975 Chevy Malibu wearing a wig and floppy mustache to disguise himself as another crime associate. Weeks watched Halloran inside the club. As he began to make his way out of the club, Weeks radioed Bulger, referring to Halloran as ""balloon head,"" a nickname they used because ""Halloran's head was so big."" ""The balloon's rising,"" Weeks radioed Bulger as Halloran got up from his table. Then as he got to the door, ""The balloon's in the air."" Weeks said he saw Bulger slide across the seat of the Chevy and call out to Halloran. Then, ""Bulger started shooting."" Michael Donahue, a bartender, was driving his grandfather's blue car and had offered his neighbor a ride home. Donahue was killed instantly. But Halloran stumbled out alive, and Bulger kept firing, Weeks said. Donahue's widow and three sons have attended every day of the trial and virtually every hearing. As police raced to the scene, Weeks said he calmly drove away, circling back to collect a hubcap, and then get something to eat because he was hungry. Drug dealer's account elicits laughs from Bulger at trial . Weeks said Bulger instructed him to get rid of the guns, which he threw into Marine Bay. He first removed a gun-stock because Bulger liked to use it. Weeks was 27 years younger than Bulger when he began working for him. He described how he, Bulger, and crime partner Steven Flemmi would take long walks and talk about business. Prosecutors introduced several surveillance photos of the three men walking around Boston's Castle Island and even setting out lounge chairs in Columbia Park across from the liquor store that served as one of Bulger's ""offices,"" all prevent anyone from listening. ""Everything I did, every business I had, Jim Bulger and Steve Flemmi were my partners always,"" said Weeks. Though Bulger and Weeks sat just six feet apart, Bulger ignored his old partner. In one of the trial's rare light moments, prosecutor Brian Kelly showed Weeks a gun belonging to Bulger. As he lifted it, the handle came off and a spring popped out. Kelly recovered smiling, ""I think that's the last gun we're going to show."" Another light moment came when the prosecutor asked Weeks why he and Bulger had worn gloves while wiping down several guns, and Weeks laughed, ""It's common sense among criminals."" Weeks wrote a book called ""Brutal: The Untold Story of my Life inside Whitey Bulger's Irish Mob,"" in part to compensate victims as part of a civil suit against him. ""My story was my only asset,"" said Weeks who served five years in prison and has testified for the government at five Bulger-related trials.

"Boston (CNN) -- With only a half-dozen witnesses to go, lawyers for James ""Whitey"" Bulger have still not confirmed whether the reputed mob boss will take the stand on his own behalf. The delay has frustrated prosecutors who Wednesday told the judge they have the right to know whether they should be working on cross-examination or closing summations. On Day 33 of the federal racketeering trial, defense lawyers continued to raise questions about what the FBI did and did not do to prevent some of the murders Bulger is accused of committing, among them the death of Bulger crime associate Brian Halloran. Retired FBI Agent James Crawford testified that 10 days before Halloran and his friend Michael Donahue were murdered, he was approached by a woman described as having a ""close relationship"" with Steven ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi, Bulger's crime partner. Defense witness criticizes FBI's inaction on Bulger . The woman insisted on total anonymity knowing she'd be killed if Flemmi found out, telling the agent there were people in law enforcement on the Bulger payroll. The confidential informant told Crawford ""Flemmi was going to kill Halloran for being a snitch."" Crawford gave her his word he would not put it in writing. However, he did speak with a supervisor who said the information should be ""put on a back burner."" Ten days later Halloran was dead. The woman, believed to be Olga Davis, later approached the FBI agent asking for help finding her daughter Debra Davis who had disappeared. Debra was Flemmi's live-in girlfriend. During the trial, Flemmi testified he lured her to a home where Bulger strangled her. Defense lawyers plan to recall hit man John Martorano to testify Flemmi admitted ""accidentally"" strangling the stunning 26 year old. The defense also plans to show that Flemmi, not Bulger, had motive to kill Deborah Hussey. Hussey's mother, Marion Hussey, testified at a deposition that Flemmi called his common-law step-daughter a ""slut, a whore, a prostitute ... doing drugs."" Also on the stand, retired FBI informant-coordinator Fred Davis. He testified that when he arrived at the Boston field office in the late 1970s there was a lot of ""paranoia"" in the bureau. ""They were nervous other agents in the office were leaking information."" Key among the suspected leakers was Bulger handler John Connolly who would ""show up in my squad all too often,"" said Davis who was also in charge of electronic surveillance. ""A lot of my agents began to say he was up to no good,"" said Davis, testifying that Connolly had access to all the FBI files. When asked why he didn't alert his superiors, Davis said ""I didn't have enough specific information ... so I handled it man-to-man, so to speak."" 'Threats' described in trial . Davis said he was out with Connolly and other agents one night and didn't have enough money for tolls. Connolly apparently gave him $20 with the message, ""Agents in Boston should never want for money."" Davis also reviewed Bulger's FBI informant file and found the quality of information ""worthless."" Davis says he felt Bulger should have been terminated as an informant, but didn't aggressively pursue it with his superiors or anyone at FBI headquarters in Washington. Soon after openly questioning the quality of Bulger's information, Davis testified that corrupt FBI supervisor John Morris, who was on the Bulger payroll, moved the top-echelon files closer to his Organized Crime Squad. Davis could not confirm whether the Bulger file that he had in his hands was the one he reviewed more than 30 years ago saying, ""This file represents a lot more than what I saw."" Prosecutor Fred Wyshak seemed to take offense at the suggestion it was a different file: ""Is it your testimony that this is NOT Mr Bulger's file,"" he asked incredulously. Wyshak explained that Bulger's file had been temporarily closed between 1978 and 1979 when Bulger was the target of an investigation and therefore not eligible to be an informant.

"(CNN) -- A lawyer for San Diego Mayor Bob Filner criticized the city for not providing sexual harassment training to the mayor, saying its failure to do so violated the law. In a letter to the city attorney, Harvey Berger wrote that Filner might never have been sued for sexual harassment had he been properly trained. ""If there is any liability at all, the city will almost certainly be liable for 'failing to prevent harassment,' "" Berger wrote in a letter dated Monday and obtained Wednesday by CNN from City Attorney Jan Goldsmith. Secrets that women of San Diego no longer keep about its mayor . An intent of Berger's letter was to urge the city to pay Filner's legal fees associated with a sexual harassment filed against him by his former spokeswoman, Irene McCormack Jackson. The city is named as a co-defendant in that lawsuit. On Tuesday, the City Council voted 9-0 to deny the mayor's request for taxpayers to pay his legal fees, according to Matt Awbrey, spokesman for council member Kevin Faulconer. Filner never received sexual harassment training while serving in Congress from 1993 to December 2012, Berger wrote. He was set to get such training -- which is required within six months of one's start date -- after becoming mayor, but the trainer canceled the session and never rescheduled, according to the lawyer. San Diego won't pay for mayor's defense . ""There is very, very good reason for mandatory sexual harassment training,"" Berger said. ""If nothing else, it makes people think about the subject and how they interact with fellow employees."" While the mayor has admitted unspecified inappropriate behavior in the past, he denies the allegations against him by Jackson. ""This is not a request for the city to agree to pay any verdict; it is simply a request for defense against unverified claims being brought against the mayor -- claims which are denied,"" Berger said. San Diego mayor sued, called unfit for office . Jackson isn't alone. Seven other women have said they were subjected to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching -- including groping and kissing -- by Filner. Many of the alleged incidents of which he's being accused took place during his five terms in a U.S. representative, before he was elected mayor last year. Berger contended that those alleged incidents took place so long ago that the accusers likely wouldn't be allowed to testify as part of Jackson's lawsuit or in their own lawsuits. Nonetheless, the wave of accusations has put tremendous pressure on Filner. His chief of staff quit, the Democratic Party of San Diego voted to call for his resignation and even his fiancee left his side. Earlier this month, Filner admitted ""I need help,"" adding, ""I'm clearly doing something wrong."" The 70-year-old later announced he would take a two-week hiatus for ""intensive counseling."" Amid calls for resignation, embattled mayor to enter clinic . Still, he has fought Jackson's lawsuit and for the city to pay his legal fees. The City Council believes San Diego shouldn't be part of the Jackson lawsuit in the first place because it had no role in the mayor's behavior and because of the city's zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment. In fact, the council decided Tuesday to file suit against Filner and seek from paying any damages should Jackson win her lawsuit. ""Bob Filner can't pay back San Diegans for the damage he's done to our city's reputation, but he can and should repay the city if there are any taxpayer costs as a result of this lawsuit,"" Faulconer said in a statement.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea downplayed North Korea's decision to not follow through on threatened retaliation to its live-fire military drill this week as political maneuvering, according to a key South Korean military official. Seoul is working to adjust its security approach, believing that North Korea might launch less conventional attacks -- including possible terrorist strikes on large civilian gatherings, according to the South Korean government official. South Korea might also strengthen its intelligence capability, the official said, calling it increasingly crucial to its defense. The South Korean live-fire naval drill ended peacefully Monday after an hour and 34 minutes. After once threatening the exercise could spur a war, North Korean military leaders said retaliation wasn't necessary but issued a stern warning to South Korea and the United States, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. The key South Korean government official dismissed North Korea's lack of military response as a calculated political decision to build goodwill with China, Russia and other allies. In recent days, the North agreed to allow U.N. inspectors access to its uranium-enrichment facility and take other steps that could defuse tension if implemented, including consideration of the formation of a military commission between North Korea, South Korea and the United States. Those steps generated at least the possibility of rare optimism on the Korean peninsula, which has been gripped by anxiety since the sinking of a South Korean warship killed 46 sailors in March. Tensions rose higher last month, when North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. The North has accused the South of provoking the Yeonpyeong attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. The latest developments in North Korea came amid a visit to North Korea by Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and current governor of New Mexico. Richardson was acting as a private citizen and not a U.S. envoy . ""Maybe we had a little impact with them,"" he said Monday of the North Korean leaders. But the South Korean government official viewed Richardson's visit skeptically, saying Pyongyang took advantage of the governor. Seoul had no official reactions to two proposals -- one to set up a hotline between South and North Korean military leaders and another to have a commission to settle simmering disputes before they flared into full-on military confrontations -- that Richardson said North Korean leaders were receptive to. Still, the fact that Pyongyang agreed to consider engaging in a multilateral dialogue with other nations through the commission is significant, said Han Park, a professor at the University of Georgia's School of Public and International Affairs and director of the university's Globis Center for the Study of Global Issues. Dialogue between the North and South alone is ""less desirable, because the two are very highly emotionally charged. It's like a family feud, if you will,"" said Park, a frequent visitor to North Korea who has close, regular contact with high-ranking North Korean officials. That's why the addition of other nations -- the United States and possibly even China -- is necessary, he said. Park said such a commission would likely discuss one of the most pressing issues -- the boundary in territorial waters. ""I think that will continue to be a source of problems,"" Park said. North Korea's nuclear program might also be discussed, he said. There also was talk about creating a hotline between the two nation's militaries ""to avert potential crises,"" according to a statement from Richardson. But Park noted that hotlines have previously been in place, but when tensions escalate, both sides will cut off the line. Richardson and others emphasized to North Korean leaders that failing to retaliate after the exercise would cast them in a positive light, he said. ""I am encouraged by the news that North Korea will not react militarily to South Korea's drills,"" Richardson said in the statement. ""During my meetings in Pyongyang, I repeatedly pressed North Korea not to retaliate."" Park said he believes that the lack of retaliation by North Korea, while ""a welcome sign,"" is a strategic move aimed at good public relations. ""They were taking the high road, so to speak,"" he said. ""I think they're trying to win the hearts and minds of the people in South Korea as well as around the world."" Public relations is ""very high on North Korea's agenda,"" he added. The U.S. State Department welcomed the North's muted response. ""This is the way countries are supposed to act,"" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. ""The South Korean exercise was defensive in nature. The North Koreans were notified in advance. There was no basis for a belligerent response."" Asked whether North Korea could be waiting for its southern neighbor to drop its guard before retaliating, Richardson told CNN that is possible but said he thinks the fact that Pyongyang ""took responsible action"" shows they are moving into a new chapter. ""I think they deserve credit for holding back,"" he said. ""I think North Korea may be sending a signal that they're ready to re-engage after having behaved very negatively."" Richardson, accompanied by CNN's Wolf Blitzer, wrapped up a five-day unofficial trip to North Korea this week. The South Korean military remained on high alert after the drill ended and is observing the North carefully, the country's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday. During the drill, fighter jets took to the sky in preparation for possible North Korean retaliation, according to the South Korean defense ministry. The South Korean president's office defended the drill Monday, saying, ""In a divided country that is militarily pitted against each other, it is natural that as a sovereign country, we will conduct military exercises and defend our territory."" The military exercise took place in waters just south of Yeonpyeong Island. After the drill ended, North Korean state-run media reported why the North did not react militarily: . ""The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) did not feel any need to retaliate against every despicable military provocation like one taking revenge after facing a blow,"" KCNA reported North Korean military officials as saying Monday. ""The second and third powerful retaliatory strike to be made by the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK knowing no limit as declared before the world will lead to blowing up the bases of the U.S. and South Korean puppet warmongers."" North Korean military officials also said the United States and South Korea perpetuated military provocation, ""far from drawing a lesson from the disgraceful defeat they suffered"" from the Yeonpyeong shelling, according to KCNA. South Korea has not said whether any additional naval drills are imminent. China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Wang Min, has reiterated China's call for both Koreas to return to the negotiating table. China is the isolated North's sole major ally and provides it with a crucial fuel and food lifeline. CNN's Kyung Lah and Jiyeon Lee in Seoul; Richard Roth and Whitney Hurst at the United Nations; Barbara Starr in Washington; and Ashley Hayes in Atlanta contributed to this report.","South Korean official calls North Korea's lack of retaliation ""political posturing""

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Nearly all of the 33 Haitian children whom American missionaries allegedly tried to take out of the earthquake-ravaged nation were reunited Wednesday with their families, weeks after they were separated. The children, who range in age from 4 months to 12 years old, have been living in SOS Children's Village, an Austrian-run orphanage in northern Port-au-Prince, since late January, when the 10 Americans they were with were arrested at the Haitian-Dominican Republic border. On Wednesday, 32 of the children were taken home by at least one parent. Authorities are still working to verify the paperwork from the parents of the remaining child, a 9-year-old girl, SOS Children's Village said. It was not immediately clear when she could be reunited with her family. Haitian authorities acknowledged that it had taken them some time to return the children. ""Authorities wanted to ensure that the children were given back to the right parents,"" said Jeanne Bernard-Pierre, the general director for Haiti's Institute of Social Welfare. The 10 Americans face charges that including kidnapping of minors for trying to take the children out of the country without required paperwork on January 29, more than two weeks after the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake. Nine of them have been released on bail and left the country. They also are charged with criminal association and arranging irregular travel. The group's leader, Laura Silsby, remains jailed in Port-au-Prince. She admitted that she did not have any documentation for the children from Haitian officials. Silsby originally said the children were orphaned or abandoned, but it has since been determined that all have at least one living parent, according to the SOS Children's Village. Some parents said they placed their children in Silsby's care because they thought that would ensure they would have a better life. The Americans said they had planned to house the children in a converted hotel in the Dominican Republic and later move them to an orphanage. The January 12 earthquake killed more than 200,000 people and flattened large portions of the capital city and surrounding areas.","32 of 33 children taken home by at least one parent Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- The heat began to fade Wednesday afternoon across the Northeast after posting near triple-digit marks from Maryland to Vermont, with another brutal day in store on Thursday. The hot, humid air that's bear-hugged the region drove temperatures up to 96 in New York and Philadelphia, 92 in Boston and 94 as far north as Burlington, Vermont. That mass -- which even the normally staid National Weather Service described as ""oppressive"" in one advisory -- is expected to hang over the region through Friday. The combination of heat and humidity is expected to drive the heat index, a measurement of how hot it feels to your body, into the triple digits again Thursday. It's also bumped ground-level ozone levels into the danger zone for children, the elderly and people with heart and lung ailments across the Northeast Corridor. Air quality warnings were posted as far south as Washington, where the odor of sweating masses of tourists added a certain ambiance to the national monuments at the height of the vacation season. ""It's pretty hot back home, but I didn't expect it to be this hot out here,"" Michael Bell, a visitor from Australia, told CNN. ""I'm about to die."" Not that Washingtonians need another reason to complain about tourists, one resident joked. Complaints flooded social media about subway cars with broken air-conditioning units. After a long day in the office, commuters were treated to an unexpected sweat lodge session on the way home. ""The sweat is just all over you all the time,"" Sam Weigman said. ""I feel like a piece of baked chicken in this heat."" Making things worse, a failing water main in suburban Prince George's County, Maryland, led authorities to warn that water might be cut off for some residents as a result. But sanitation officials reported Wednesday afternoon that while some restrictions on water use were being imposed, no one would be without service. ""If we continue to conserve, I am confident the system will remain full while we complete repairs,"" Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission chief Jerry Johnson said in a written statement. Beating the heat . Relief isn't likely before the weekend, when a strong cold front will move through the Great Lakes on Friday and into the Northeast on Saturday. The downside is that also could bring severe thunderstorms capable of producing widespread wind damage. The saunalike conditions are driving people to desperate measures. The most obvious: Cranking up the air conditioning. So many New Yorkers are doing that, they're close to setting a record for electricity usage, utility officials said. Electricity provider Con Edison's record is 13,189 megawatts, set on July 22, 2011. Current consumption is apparently challenging the grid. Con Edison faced a bump in outages and has sent crews hustling to restore power to more than 7,600 customers since the heat rose Sunday. If parking in front of the air conditioner isn't cutting it, try to fly away. JetBlue is offering ""hot seats"" promotions whenever the temperature in New York breaks 90 degrees. They went like hotcakes Tuesday. Sorry, ""Sold out today,"" read a banner plastered over JetBlue's website. But the special runs through Saturday. So there's hope yet. Dangerous heat . The National Weather Service defines a heat wave as two or more days of ""abnormally and uncomfortably hot and unusually humid weather."" And levity aside, it can have deadly consequences. Anyone who lived in New York in 1972 will tell you that. A two-week wave killed 891 people then. On Wednesday, 33 of the more than 4,000 fire calls in New York were for heat-related issues, Fire Department spokeswoman Elisheva Zakheim said. The city has recorded one heat-related death so far this year, on July 8, the New York medical examiner's office said. Fortunately, this wave hasn't claimed any lives. But the New York Fire Department did respond to 37 heat-related incidents Monday and 25 more as of late Tuesday. The Red Cross and the New York mayor's office are warning people to stay in cool spaces and drink plenty of water. The city has opened cooling centers for those who don't have access to air conditioning. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Leslie Bentz, Sunlen Miller and Laura Ly contributed to this report.","NEW: Highs hit 96 in New York and Philadelphia, 94 in Burlington, 92 in Boston .

"(CNN) -- Tony Soprano was a bully and a lover, a lightning rod and a superstar. And thanks to scripts crafted by David Chase and others, he was also, at times, prophetic, wise, even poetic. Here are a few of Tony Soprano's many choice lines during ""The Sopranos"" acclaimed run on HBO, compiled from IMDB.com and TVfanatic.com and spoken by actor James Gandolfini, who died in Italy while on holiday. -- Talking to his psychiatrist: ""We're soldiers. Soldiers don't go to hell. It's war. Soldiers kill other soldiers. We're in a situation where everyone involved knows the stakes and if you are going to accept those stakes, you've got to do certain things. It's business."" Appreciation: Gandolfini, a pure actor . -- From another conversation with his psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi: ""This isn't painful. Getting shot is painful. Getting stabbed in the ribs is painful. This ... isn't painful. It's empty. Dead."" -- Speaking to his wife, Carmela: ""You're only religious when it suits you."" -- Speaking to Christopher Moltisanti, the cousin of Tony Soprano's wife and part of his inner circle: ""Blood. You're going to lead this family into the 21st century."" -- In response to Dr. Melfi's question, after he threatens to smash her face during a therapy session: ""Is this a woman thing? You ask me how I'm feeling. I tell you how I'm feeling, and now you're going to torture me with it."" -- Referring to his mother's involvement in a plot to kill him: ""What kind of person can I be, where his own mother wants him dead? -- Speaking again to Dr. Melfi: ""The things I take pleasure in, I can't do."" Of course, Tony Soprano was just one of many roles that Gandolfini played in his decades-long career. With his large frame and, at times, intimidating sneer, he cast a big shadow in numerous movie, television and theater productions before his death this week in Italy. Below are some notable quotes that he uttered in a few of those roles. Opinion: Gandolfini's gift to television -- and America . -- As CIA director in 2012's ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" talking about intelligence related to a compound where Osama bin Laden is later killed: ""Can't you put a camera somewhere -- in the trees -- to get a look into the main house? ... We have to get a look into the house."" -- As the monster Carol to the young boy ""king"" Max in the 2009 movie adaptation of ""Where the Wild Things Are"": ""This used to be all rock, and now it's sand. And then, one day, it's going to be dust. And then the whole island will be dust. And then ... well, I don't even know what comes after dust."" -- As Eddie Poole, challenging another character to kill him in 1999's ""8MM"": ""What are you waiting for? Go ahead, do it! ... What do you want me to do, start crying like a little baby? 'Oh, I'm sorry I killed the little girl.' Well, f--k you and f--k her! Go ahead! Put me outta my f----ing misery!"" -- As Lt. Bobby Daughtert in 1995's ""Crimson Tide"" questioning a new first officer, Hunter, who'd challenged their submarine's captain: ""We've been following the captain for years, and now this a--hole Hunter shows up, and we're supposed to follow him because he said so?"" -- As Virgil, a deranged mobster, in 1993's ""True Romance"": ""Now the first time you kill somebody, that's the hardest....

"(CNN) -- Mikhail Youzhny's hopes of reaching the lucrative season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London were crushed on Tuesday when the Russian suffered a back injury. The 28-year-old is 10th in the standings, but his bid to win one of the remaining three places for the eight-man event was halted in the second round of the Paris Masters. Seeded ninth, Youzhny was trailing Ernests Gulbis 6-4 3-0 when he had to quit -- meaning the Latvian will next play either American eight seed Andy Roddick or Finland's Jarkko Nieminen. Sixth seed Fernando Verdasco kept his own hopes alive as he came from behind to beat veteran Frenchman Arnaud Clement 3-6 6-3 6-0 for the left-hander's second win since reaching the U.S. Open quarterfinals in September. The Spaniard, who is ninth in the ATP standings, will play either French 12th seed Gael Monfils -- last year's losing finalist -- or German Benjamin Becker in the third round. In Tuesday's other second-round matches, Radek Stepanek beat Spain's Nicolas Almagro 7-6 (7-3) 6-4, with the Czech to next face either top seed Roger Federer or France's Richard Gasquet. Nadal insists: I'll be fit for ATP Tour Finals . Another Frenchman, Gilles Simon, set up a third-round clash with fourth seed Robin Soderling by defeating Kazakhstan's Andrey Golubev 3-6 6-4 6-3. Fifth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych, who is first in line for a London place, beat French wildcard entry Florent Serra 6-3 6-1 in the late match. In Tuesday's first-round matches, Argentina's Juan Monaco beat American Sam Querrey 7-6 (9-7) 6-2 to earn a Wednesday encounter with second seed and defending champion Novak Djokovic. Third seed Andy Murray, who also had an opening bye, will start his campaign against Argentina's David Nalbandian after the 2007 champion defeated Spain's Marcel Granollers 6-3 6-1. Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko will take on Thomaz Belluci in his opening match after the Brazilian began with a hard-fought 7-6 (7-5) 5-7 6-3 victory over Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber. If he wins that match, Davydenko will then take on Berdych. Croatian 13th seed Marin Cilic faces Sergiy Stakhovsky, who thrashed fellow Ukrainian Illya Marchenko 6-2 6-2.

"(CNN) -- The acquittal of George Michael Zimmerman, 29, means he's a free man and will be able to walk out of the courthouse because he's no longer in police custody. He will be free, if he chooses, to leave Seminole County, Florida. But one of his attorneys, Mark O'Mara, has said that Zimmerman is a marked man and lives in fear for his life. Jury acquits Zimmerman . In fact, during court proceedings, Zimmerman didn't disclose where he had been residing for more than a year, and he dared to venture outdoors only when in disguise. Zimmerman also wore body armor. ""I believe his life is at risk, and I don't say that for dramatic effect,"" O'Mara said before the verdict. ""There are a lot of people who think George killed Trayvon Martin for racial reasons, even though nothing supports that. And if they feel that anger enough, they could react violently."" It's doubtful that Zimmerman would be able to return to his pursuit of a career in law enforcement. He was enrolled in Seminole State College at the time of the February 26, 2012, shooting. Share your reaction . One expert advised against such a plan for Zimmerman. ""That is the absolute worst thing you can do,"" said Mike Paul, a reputation management counselor in New York. ""It might be your old passion. My advice would be, you need to find a new passion. And it needs to be helping people in a very different way, a way that is much more compassionate, not just involving law enforcement."" Zimmerman -- who is married but has no children -- may choose to resume his career in mortgage insurance or in an undergraduate education. It remains to be seen whether his post-acquittal life could parallel that of another high-profile defendant found not guilty: Casey Anthony, the Florida woman accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter in 2008. ""You never know who the nuts are or where they are,"" said Cheney Mason, a defense attorney for Anthony. ""There are still people that threaten me."" Mason acknowledged that when the court of public opinion deems a defendant guilty, life can be very difficult. Zimmerman apparently enjoys support from his parents and immediate family, some of whom testified in his defense. He has been able to pay for his defense by raising thousands of dollars from the public. But crisis public relations manager Gene Grabowski said Zimmerman must tread carefully when accepting further public money. ""He's got to be careful to avoid the appearance of creating more divisions by accepting money or support openly from groups that maybe that would create more friction because of the tenor of this case,"" Grabowski said. ""He's got to be careful about who he associates with afterwards, even if they are offering financial support."" The three-week trial ignited a national debate about race relations. Martin, an African-American high school student, was walking through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, to his father's fiancee's house when a confrontation occurred between him and Zimmerman. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, called 911 to report ""a suspicious person"" in the neighborhood. Despite the dispatcher's instructions not to get out of his vehicle, Zimmerman exits his SUV, and an exchange unfolded between Martin and Zimmerman. Neighbors heard a single shot fired. Zimmerman asserted he shot Martin in self-defense as Martin beat his head against the concrete sidewalk. Zimmerman, who describes himself as Hispanic, has a Peruvian mother and white American father. He has been free on bail since last July. Initially, Sanford police didn't charge Zimmerman because they said they had no grounds to disprove his account. Led by Martin's family, a public uproar ensued, in which even President Barack Obama remarked that the incident required ""soul-searching."" Then, almost two months after the shooting, a special prosecutor charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder.","Zimmerman is free to leave Florida but might face a life as a marked man .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian security forces have arrested a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman as they continue to round up high-profile members of the organization.

Egypt has been in turmoil since the military ousted President Mohamed Morsy in July. The military and Morsy opponents have battled Muslim Brotherhood members. Morsy led the political arm of the group. In August, hundreds of people -- citizens as well as members of security forces -- were killed.

"(CNN) -- Police in Colombia have arrested four people accused of killing a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent during an attempted robbery. Colombia's National Police said the four suspects they arrested were part of a criminal network of thieves. Two additional suspects who were allegedly involved in the crime remain on the loose, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. The United States will request extradition of the suspects, but it has not yet done so formally, a law enforcement official said. U.S. officials have extradited and prosecuted suspects accused of killing U.S. federal agents in the past. Special Agent James ""Terry"" Watson, assigned to the DEA unit in Cartagena, was on temporary duty in Bogota when he died after being stabbed in a taxi cab last Thursday night, officials said. Authorities have said they do not believe the attack was connected to his work for the U.S. agency. ""The homicide of the DEA agent was committed by common criminals and was not connected to his work in Colombia,"" National Police Director Gen. Jose Roberto Leon Riano said, according to Caracol. U.S. officials praised Colombian authorities Tuesday for their swift investigation. ""The Drug Enforcement Administration is grateful for the outstanding work of the Colombian National Police, the Special Investigative Unit and the Attorney General's Office that led to the swift arrest of these suspects,"" DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a written statement. ""We will never forget Special Agent Watson and his sacrifice, as well as all those who have given their lives for the rule of law.

Watson, 42, had been watching the last game of the NBA finals at a Bogota restaurant Thursday night and left in a taxi, a State Department spokesman said last week. Investigators believe Watson's cab stopped at a traffic light and his assailants jumped out of two other cabs, which pulled up on either side of the vehicle in which he was riding, a law enforcement official said. According to the official, Watson managed to escape from the cab and was taken to a hospital, where he died. In Colombia, such attacks are known as ""millionaire rides."" Authorities said the suspects they arrested were part of a gang known for millionaire ride robberies. The DEA said Watson was a 13-year veteran of the agency. He had been sent to Afghanistan three times on counternarcotics trafficking assignments and had previously served in the Army and worked for the U.S. Marshals Service.

"Washington (CNN) -- Inside a tall, red-brick building in Alexandria, Virginia, there is a federal courtroom just waiting for admitted intelligence leaker Edward Snowden to show up. But if he ever gets there, and it may be a while, the record of trials in the Eastern District of Virginia suggests justice could be swift and certain. The modern, high-security facility just south of the nation's capital was the original home of what has come to be known as ""the rocket docket"" -- a place where many cases proceed at lightning speed relative to legal proceedings elsewhere. High profile national security cases are tried there. It also is where the government's criminal complaint against Snowden alleging violations of the Espionage Act was filed. There has been no indictment yet. While Snowden's case is unusual and entangled in secrets that it could drag out for years, the Eastern District undeniably is one of the places that puts a premium on the concept of a ""speedy trial."" That's why a guy in Snowden's position -- now a world away in Russia with a grant of temporary asylum -- has to think about his next move. So what's an NSA leaker to do? Opinion: Former spy: U.S. gains with Snowden in Russia . While it is not always wise to speak with certainty about matters of international intrigue, here are five possible moves Snowden could make. Option 1: Find a way to get to a place of relative ""long term"" refuge. In a major victory, Snowden won temporary political asylum in Russia. ""It's a very significant achievement for Snowden. It gives him an entire year for him to figure out his options, to see if he can manage to get to one of the countries that has offered him asylum in South America. It takes him out of the discomfort of the transit zone and into Russia itself, where he presumably has to be with friends and associates and it just gives him a tremendous amount of time,"" said international extradition lawyer Jacques Semmelman. The down side for Snowden is that his asylum is limited. ""It creates the possibility that there has to be something new that will come up in a year,"" said CNN consultant and former FBI official Tom Fuentes. Option 2: Negotiate a solution and return to the United States. Edward Snowden's father, Lon Snowden, hoped at first that there might be a way to arrange for his son to return to the United States. But as of last week, he had changed his opinion dramatically after hearing commentary on the issue from Congress and the Obama administration. ""In this climate, I don't believe that's possible. So yes, I think Russia is the best place for him. Russia has the strength and conviction to protect my son."" But experts don't think the Department of Justice is itching to strike a deal that would clear the way for Snowden's return. ""The U.S. will not negotiate with fugitives as a matter of policy,"" Semmelman said. Option 3: Extradition. It's the least of Snowden's worries now. The United States has no extradition treaty with Russia. Why? Because certain senators fought it out of fear Russia might ask the United States to hand over Russian dissidents and other defectors. The chances of the United States quickly ratifying an extradition treaty are unlikely. Option 4: The ""no passport"" play. This could be a problem for Snowden. When he was indicted, the State Department also revoked his passport. According to Fuentes, international agreements allow governments to deport people without valid passports to the country from which they entered or to the nation of their citizenship. ""So in this case, the Russians could at any time -- they could have done it already, they could do it now -- they could stick him back on a nonstop flight to U.S. and say goodbye ... or to Hong Kong where Snowden was last."" Hong Kong has an extradition agreement with the United States. Option 5: Head to a nation's embassy that will keep him. Experts say it is always a possibility to camp at a foreign embassy in Moscow or elsewhere. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. And Snowden is traveling with a representative of WikiLeaks. ""Once he is in an embassy, in the sovereignty of another country there is nothing the U.S. could do,"" Semmelman said. Opinion: How Putin's move could help Snowden and U.S. What is not likely, we are told, is a scenario involving U.S. operatives grabbing Snowden off the streets of Moscow and delivering him to the Eastern District courtroom. That, say experts, only happens in Hollywood.","Granted temporary asylum, Edward Snowden has few options while in Russia .
The federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, specializes in the highest-level national security cases .
Snowden could be part of a negotiated deal to send him back to the United States .
However, extradition is unlikely in the case of Snowden, who's addmited to leaking intel secrets ."
"(CNN) -- Being Superman isn't as simple as it once was. Seventy-five years ago, when the Kryptonian caped--crusader first appeared on the cover of Action Comics #1, hoisting a car over his head, he not only stood for truth, justice, and the American way, he also had a virtual monopoly on the men-in-tights genre. Lately, though, that field has gotten awfully crowded. The local multiplex is lousy with celluloid crime fighters. So what turf is left for good old Clark Kent? That's the nagging question that director Zack Snyder's Man of Steel tries — and ultimately fails — to answer. Snyder, whose best films are 2004's -adrenalized Dawn of the Dead remake and 2007's hyper-stylized Spartan saga 300, has teamed up with producer Christopher Nolan to give us a cooler, more conflicted Superman. But their Dark Knight-style makeover never quite comes -together. Sure, -Superman is still faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive (and thanks to the -impossibly handsome Henry Cavill, an easy-on-the-eyes slice of spandex-clad beefcake to boot). But he's been transformed into the latest in a long line of soul-searching super-brooders, trapped between his devastated birth planet of Krypton and his adopted new home on Earth. He's just another haunted outsider grappling with issues. How high will 'Man of Steel' fly on opening weekend? At the risk of damning Cavill with faint praise, the 30-year-old Brit makes a better Man of Steel than the milquetoast Brandon Routh did in 2006's Superman Returns. But he isn't exactly Mr. Charisma either. And I suspect that Superman aficionados will be disappointed by just how joyless most of Snyder's reboot is. During a prologue that goes on way too long setting the bloated tone for the film, Superman's father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) squares off against General Zod (Michael Shannon) on Krypton. The planet is on the verge of destruction, and Jor-El ships his newborn son off to Earth to save him, prompting the maniacal Zod to roar about his plans for revenge. With its shock-and-awe barrage of sci-fi fire and brimstone, the opening-act salvo should -dazzle and transport us. Instead, it just gets weighed down by CGI overkill and thickets of exposition about a Kryptonian codex. Hans Zimmer's 'Man of Steel' soundtrack has new surround sound tech . Things pick up a bit down on Earth, where little Kal-El has crash-landed in Kansas and been raised by the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). They've rechristened him Clark, a boy who's taught to keep his special gifts under wraps- — especially after he saves a busful of classmates and draws the wrong kind of attention. Cavill plays the grown-up Clark as a sort of existential loner who drifts from town to town, leaving a series of good deeds in his mysterious wake...until Lois Lane (Amy Adams) figures out his game. The 21st-century Lois isn't the gullible gal Friday she was in the old comics or the Christopher Reeve Superman films, where she was played by Margot Kidder. Now she's a hard-nosed, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter. That's -progress, I guess. But there's a distinct lack of heat between Adams and Cavill, and their stabs at sub-sitcom humor fall flat. Lois Lane through the years . See Amy Adam's transformation . Meanwhile, Shannon's Zod huffs and puffs, demanding that the puny earthlings hand over Superman, which leads to endless brawls between the two where neither seems able to get hurt. I understand that fight scenes like these have become de rigueur centerpieces in comic-book -popcorn extravaganzas, but here they go on forever and have a numbing sameness. They're simply excuses to smash the scenery to bits while Hans Zimmer works up a sweat beating the drums of war on the soundtrack. The only moments of real spectacle come when Superman learns to fly. He rockets through the air like a comet, and it's thrilling. There aren't enough of these gee-whiz -moments of wonder in Man of Steel. Never has a race to save the fate of humankind seemed so tedious. C . See the original story at EW.com .

"London (CNN) -- With the financial crisis in the eurozone, Germany finds itself in a position that everybody seems to envy, except the Germans themselves. The government and a majority of German citizens would like to shine through example rather than action. If only others would emulate the ""German model,"" so the argument goes, there would be no crisis in the eurozone. Angela Merkel: Europe's Mrs. Nein . One could easily discard this as the flattering self-image that all patriots have of their own country. But the curious thing is that the critics of Germany come to almost the same conclusion, except that they would admire the German model without the permanent export surplus. Yet, like all such models, it is at best a half-truth. There is a myth that Germans are still traumatized by the hyperinflation of the interwar years, a memory that has somehow become part of the genetic endowment of every German. Peer Steinbrueck: The man who stirred up German politics . That's why the Kohl government insisted on making the European Central Bank a clone of the Bundesbank -- except that the two central banks pursue very different monetary strategies: the ECB does nothing to maintain a permanent export surplus of the euro area as the Bundesbank did for its currency area back then. The Bundesbank achieved this exactly as China achieves it today: instead of selling all the foreign exchange it earned from its export surplus, it hoarded vast foreign exchange reserves. This prevented an appreciation of the Deutschmark because piling up these reserves means somebody expresses huge demand for dollars, francs and pounds. Watch: Merkel says Europe has lost competitiveness . But there is one snag. Handing out your own currency against all these foreign exchange earnings can create inflation and thus real appreciation: the price of domestic goods rises in terms of foreign goods and makes domestic goods more expensive. So the Bundesbank reined in domestic credit supply -- according to the jargon, it sterilized (or counteracted) the expansion of the money supply through trade by reducing the money supply that is generated in domestic credit. All this is to say that what explains the anti-inflationary stance of German monetary policy was not the trauma of the 1920s but the Bundesbank playing its part in maintaining export surpluses. It actually had a worse inflation record than the ECB and back then, it did not think that 2% inflation was the tolerable maximum: as long as the trading partners had a higher one, why care about such a number? Such an undervaluation strategy makes perfect sense -- and only perfect sense -- when you are concerned about employment and demand for your products. It's a Keynesian concern. This, then, is the second myth that Germans and the country's critics share: the German lands are populated by ""ordoliberals,"" a Teutonic version of small-but-strong-state liberalism that is anti-Keynesian. It was certainly different from the United States with its then-fashionable version of Keynesianism, namely domestic pump priming. US administrations criticized the German authorities for their macroeconomic strategy of begging the transatlantic neighbor just as they criticize the Chinese authorities today. Pushed into a corner, the accused would always say they did not interfere (Germany) or act in self-defense (China). But Keynes knew about beggar-thy-neighbor policies that countries with underemployment pursue, even if he did not endorse them. Does the performance of Germany today not prove that its success is down to the fact that the Germans work so hard and save so much? That's another convenient myth that the critics grudgingly concede. What doesn't quite fit the myth is that Germans have relatively low annual working hours in comparison with other nations. Labor market reforms in the early 2000s helped to create more jobs with fewer hours, and the hours each employee works have gone down further over the past decade. While the overall volume of work went up by less than 3% between 2002 and 2012, the number of people in work went up by almost 6%. Read more: Eurozone crisis tarnishes Germany's 'Iron Lady' There are also many more jobs that are poorly paid. Together with the UK, Germany is the Western European country with the highest share of low wage workers. These are defined as workers that earn less than two thirds of the national median wage: 22% of all those employed in Germany are low-paid, only Poland (24%), Romania (26%) and Latvia (28%) have higher shares. Labor market reforms arguably scared organized labor into accepting wage increases below the rise in productivity, so unit labor costs fell. Such state-induced and coordinated wage competition is new. It helps maintain the export surplus but it busts the myth that German competitiveness is all about quality products and not wage costs. As to savings: the world was recently surprised by a report of the ECB that showed how little wealth Germans have accumulated if they supposedly save so much. The puzzle has been solved: first of all, Germans get their old age security from public pensions rather than from home-ownership but pensions were excluded from the survey. German firms hold more capital than most others in Europe. The discrepancy between the value of domestic production and the value of domestic consumption mostly accrues to firms, making the wealth distribution one of the most unequal in Europe. All of this means that what German wage earners consume has much lower value than what they produce (and earn in wages), and not that Germans are constantly tightening their belts. Another myth busted. The unfortunate consequence of these myths is that they harden Germany's stance towards a solution to the crisis in the eurozone. If their success as an export nation has supposedly nothing to do with policies and is all due to hard work and avid saving, then indeed why should the others not become ""more like us?"" But if Germany still pursues beggar-thy-neighbor policies in order to create more jobs, the hard work is on average now just less well-paid work, and the savings are disproportionately enriching firms, then perhaps even Germans will see that something is wrong, and that continuing to behave like a successful emerging market is not a model for the rest of the Eurozone, not only because it beggars-the-neighbors but also because it does little for ordinary people in Germany. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Waltraud Schelkle.","Many in struggling countries across the eurozone envy Germany's strong economy .

"(CNN) -- Jazz has always been a popular form of music because its improvisatory nature is easily adapted by a community or nation to reflect its individual identity. Polish policemen watch a demonstration near the University in Warsaw in December 1981. In Poland, jazz has been intertwined with its politics and through it, has gained its own particular identity and recognition, as has Poland as a nation. The First World War marked a turning point in Polish history. After 300 years of divided rule under Prussia, Austria and Russia, Poland became an independent democratic republic lasting until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. The end of the First World War also marked the spread through Europe of American jazz. According to polishjazz.com, the first Polish jazz band was started in 1923 by Zygmunt Karasinski and Symon Kataszek, calling itself simply Karasinski & Kataszek Jazz-Tango Orchestra. It was an almost immediate success, playing in popular Warsaw venues of the time. Other popular dance bands established themselves during the 1920s and the first jazz recordings were being recorded by Polish record label Syrena Records. With the rise of the Nazis and accompanying anti-semitism under Adolf Hitler in neighboring Germany, Jewish musicians such as Ady Rosner and Erwin Woheller came to Poland, enriching the Polish jazz scene with their talent. Rosner became the best and most popular jazz musician, who later on in his life became a driving force of Soviet jazz. Throughout the 1930s, the music of American jazz artists such as Duke Ellington was widely available and popular, as were the first music magazines from London, Paris and America. This flourishing scene came to an abrupt end with the invasion and occupation of Poland by the German Army. The end of the war saw Poland being occupied yet again, this time by the Soviet Red Army. Poland, now called People's Republic of Poland, became a Soviet-controlled puppet state. Music fell under Soviet control too and jazz, with its syncopated rhythms and free style, did not fall into the prescribed mould. In Stalinist Poland, jazz was banned and went on to develop its own style underground. During the first half of the 1950s, the death of Joseph Stalin and Wladyslaw Gomulka's appointment as First Secretary in the Polish regime had a more liberalizing effect on the country. Jazz was out in the open once more; being listened to, talked about and played without fear. The first jazz magazine behind the Iron Curtain was published; official jazz clubs were created and the Polish Jazz Federation was started by Jan Byrczek in 1964. Byrczek went on to found the Polish Jazz Society which became one of the largest jazz organisations of Europe. The 50s also saw the first official jazz festival taking place in Sopot beginning a tradition of jazz festivals in Poland that lasts to this day. Initial hopes that Gomulka's reforms would move towards democratisation were dashed but despite political obstacles, Poland's cultural and intellectual life continued to grow and flourish during the following decade. Jazz was being featured in TV programmes; jazz critique was growing as were jazz festivals. In 1964, the Jazz at the Oder River festival in Wroclaw started. Another milestone of the decade was the start of the recording of ""The Polish Jazz Series"" by the official recording label Polskie Nagrania-Muza. It continued doing so until well into the Eighties, later re-releasing all the volumes in CD format. During the 1970s, Edward Gierek replaced Gomulka as First Party Secretary. He, being on a more friendly footing with Western neighbors than his predecessors, received loans and with them, the slow trickle of Western goods (notably Coca Cola) and TV shows into Poland. The government's pro-Western stance also allowed Polish culture to reach out to the West. The leading Polish jazz magazine Jazz Forum was being published in Polish, English and German and distributed in 103 countries. Trumpeter Tomasz Stanko came to the fore during this period, receiving the first European Jazz Award in 2002 as one or Europe's most outstanding jazz musicians. Towards the end of the 70s, Gierek's political career came to a close after a wave of labor strikes resulting from his policies. It was in this turbulent time that the independent trade union, the Solidarity Movement, was started in the Gdansk shipyards by Lech Walesa. Solidarity's growing strength led General Jaruzelski to declare martial law in December 1981. However Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms in Soviet Russia; pressure from Polish Pope John Paul II and Western leaders forced the Communists to the negotiating table. This led to Solidarity's participation in semi-free elections 1989 resulting in a coalition government. Walesa became President of Poland until 1995. The political events were reflected in the jazz scene. The early 80s brought the ""Young Power"" movement lead by Krzysztof Popek. According to allaboutjazz.com, musician Cezary Lerski described his movement as being ""verbally critical and musically adventurous,"" revolutionzing Polish jazz. Popek is still a driving force of Polish Jazz today. One of the purely Polish streams of jazz are the interpretations of the music of Polish composer Frederic Chopin started by pianist Andrzej Jagodzinski. Reflecting the new freedom brought by democratisation another important band came to the fore at the beginning of the 90s. This was ""Milosc,"" playing free jazz, going so far as to describe its form of jazz as ""yass"" thereby creating a new stream or genre in Polish jazz. But it too followed the path of the Young Power Movement by becoming more mainstream. Current jazz reflects the diversity that democratic and economic freedom have brought Poland. A multiplicity of small jazz clubs have sprung up throughout the country as have a number of jazz festivals and independent record labels. Lersky writes that Polish jazz is"" mature, vibrant and evolving"" -- a reflection of the politics of the day?","History of Polish jazz has been intertwined with its politics .
Born in democracy; banned by Communists; now evolving in new democracy .
Jazz is a popular, individual genre characterised by improvisation ."
"(CNN) -- So much for ""Peaceful Easy Feeling."" North Charleston, South Carolina, police say a woman is charged with cutting her housemate with kitchen knives because he wouldn't stop playing music by the classic rock band The Eagles. The 54-year-old woman was arrested early Tuesday and booked on ""criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature."" In plain language, cops say she knifed the victim -- her former boyfriend -- because he wouldn't stop playing the band known for hits including ""Hotel California,"" ""Heartache Tonight"" and ""Desperado."" The 64-year-old victim suffered lacerations on an arm, elbow and hand, police said in a report, but was not seriously injured. The man was listening to The Eagles when his housemate told him she didn't want to hear the band anymore, according to police. Their disagreement quickly escalated when the victim told the woman to ""shut up,"" police said. The woman then went to the kitchen, grabbed a 14-inch serrated bread knife and started to swing it at the man, police said. The man was cut several times before he and a friend restrained the woman. The two men eventually let her go, only to have the woman grab another knife and cut the victim several more times, police said. Police added that ""all parties involved were intoxicated."" As to whether a particular Eagles song took the argument to the limit, a police spokesman said he didn't know.","A South Carolina woman didn't like her housemate's choice of music, police say .

"(CNN) -- Internet and cell phone coverage were restored Saturday to most Syrian provinces, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, two days after a blackout shut down virtually all Internet service in the country. Residents in the capital, Damascus, told CNN via Skype that their Internet and cell phone services were working again. Syria's Internet and phone systems blacked out Thursday. A Syrian government information minister said Friday that ""terrorists"" -- which is how the Assad regime refers to rebels in a bloody, ongoing civil war -- cut the cable, knocking out Web communication with other countries. ""All the Internet connections and communications lines are back to work in Damascus and its suburbs, after the technicians teams managed to fix the malfunction that led to the outage for two days,"" an anchor on state-run TV said Saturday. The network reported there was a malfunction in the main grid in the suburbs of Damascus. Rebels have routinely used the Web to transmit images of the civil war, including what they claim have been military attacks by the Assad regime on civilians. However, a leading Web security firm said the outage was almost certainly the work of the Syrian government. Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare, said his firm's investigations showed that all four Internet cables linking Syria to the outside world would have had to been cut simultaneously for a whole country outage to occur. The blackout forced fighters to rely on radio communication, which they say is easier for the Syrian government to tap. The U.S. Embassy in Damascus and expat opposition supporters urged people to use ""Speak to Tweet,"" a service which allows users to leave an audio message which is tweeted out as a link for people to click on and play. However, the phone service outage likely made it difficult to use. As a result of the Internet shutdown, the flood of daily video images of fighting and decimation dried up. Rebel leaders accused the government of creating the blackout to hide its mass killings from the outside world. At least 165 people have been killed Saturday across Syria, including 60 in Damascus and its suburbs, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. At least eight people were killed when a car bomb exploded in the northern city of Reqqah, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Two other car bombs went off in Damascus, the group said. No casualties were reported in those attacks. Meanwhile, in a continued attempt to weaken President Bashar al-Assad's aerial strength, Syria's rebel fighters say they have tightened their grip on territory near Damascus International Airport. Rebels have taken control of a crescent shaped swath of land about 20 kilometers long just north and east of the main road leading to the airport, said a revolutionary council for the Damascus area. The airport is ""the gate of death that supplies the regime in Damascus and its suburbs with more tools to kill the Syrian people,"" said Abu Eyaad, spokesman to the Revolutionary Military Council in Damascus and its Suburbs in an audio message posted late Friday. Although rebel forces have not taken the airport, they have shut down its operations, claimed Abu Eyaad, which is his nom de guerre. ""Our main goal is to sap the strength of the regime's air force and supplies."" He accused Russia and Iran of delivering arms to Assad's army via the airport. The government rejected the rebels' claim on state-run TV on a banner reading, ""Damascus airport is functioning normally, and the highway to the airport is fully secure."" The network aired footage of the airport, along with interviews of employees and passengers, to show that operations were normal. The captured swath stretches from the town of Harran Al-Awameed, almost within a mile of the airport, up to the Damascus suburb of Deir Asafeer and includes a captured military helicopter airport and a road to connect them all, the military council said. Despite government bombardments, which have rained death and destruction indiscriminately from above for months upon rebel stronghold neighborhoods, revolutionary fighters have gained ground. They have captured military bases, driving out regular army troops, seizing their heavy weaponry and turning it back on them -- including anti-aircraft guns and missiles. In the last week, rebels claim to have shot down one plane and two helicopters in Syria's north. CNN's Arwa Damon went to the crash site of the plane Wednesday, and saw chunks of metal being carted off by locals. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday called for ongoing support of the opposition's ""current momentum"" via non-military aid to Syrian rebels in a speech in Washington. The United States and many of its allies have thrown their support behind the rebel movement and openly advocate the overthrow of Assad's government. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon urged the international community Friday, ""in particular the Security Council,"" to pull together. Council members China and Russia, which are allies of Assad, are at loggerheads over the handling of the crisis with the other permanent members France, Britain and the United States, which oppose Assad. Ban said he would soon visit Syrian refugees who have fled over the borders to neighboring countries. More than 42,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict since the uprising began in March 2011, according to opposition activists. CNN cannot confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within Syria. Samira Said, Ben Brumfield, Yousuf Basil and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 165 people killed across Syria on Saturday, says an opposition group .

Shortly after his arrival Wednesday in Saudi Arabia, Obama and King Abdullah went to the Saudi ruler's farm for a welcoming reception. The two leaders met privately afterward.

Obama leaves late Wednesday for Cairo, Egypt, where he is to address a mostly Muslim audience Thursday (6 a.m. ET). His plans to improve America's image among Muslims have been in the works since his first week in office. iReport.com: How can U.S. better relate to Muslims? ""My job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a stake in the well-being of the Muslim world, that the language we use has to be a language of respect,"" Obama said in a January interview with Al-Arabiya television network. ""I have Muslim members of my family. I have lived in Muslim countries."" When the White House announced the Mideast trip in May, spokesman Robert Gibbs described Egypt as ""a country that in many ways represents the heart of the Arab world."" Gibbs deflected questions at his daily briefing about whether Egypt was a wise choice, given President Hosni Mubarak's resistance to making his government more democratic. CNN's Ben Wedeman, who talked to Egyptians in Cairo to gauge their sentiments, said most of the people were eagerly awaiting the president's visit but said some were concerned that Obama, by making Egypt the focus of his trip, could legitimize Mubarak's 28-year rule. These Egyptians said they feared Obama might not discuss with Mubarak long-sought problems such as the need for democracy and political reform. People are looking for something palpable and concrete, Wedeman said. They would like the United States to be more engaged in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said.  Watch what Egyptians say they want to hear from Obama » . ""What they want is results, not just words,"" Wedeman said. There were visible preparations for Obama's visit, he said. Many streets were repaved, and markets were selling T-shirts in his honor, with some reading: ""Obama: New Tutankhamen of the World."" In April, Obama chose Turkey, a more secular state, as the site of his first presidential speech to a Muslim majority nation. He told the Turkish legislature in Ankara that the ""United States is not and will never be at war with Islam."" Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright pointed to a common theme among the many conferences she has attended with Muslim speakers: ""When the Cold War ended, America needed an enemy to replace Communism and chose Islam."" In an op-ed Tuesday in The New York Times, Albright wrote, ""How else, they ask, to explain the two Gulf wars, Afghanistan, Guantánamo and the plight of the Palestinians? ""To support their thesis, they cite the bellicose post-9/11 rhetoric of U.S. officials, the Western media's preoccupation with Muslim extremists and the plethora of pundits who have identified Islam, especially 'political Islam,' as the leading threat to civilization in the 21st century.""  iReport: Are you concerned about the way Muslims have been portrayed in recent years? Albright said, ""To most Americans, the idea that our country is attacking Islam or that we view the Islamic faith as an enemy is absurd."" She pointed out that in the 1990s, the U.S. twice led NATO into conflicts on behalf of Muslim populations -- first in Bosnia, then in Kosovo. Not long before Obama departed on his trip, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey suggested that more than two in five Americans, or 46 percent, have an unfavorable opinion of Muslim countries. That view is an increase of 5 percentage points from 2002. Three in 10 Americans questioned said they had a neutral opinion. On Tuesday, Gibbs told reporters: ""I think what is important is that we demonstrate that the United States wants to pursue a different relationship and ensure that Muslims around the world understand the message of the United States."" He said, ""We have more in common than we have disagreement about, and I think that's what he wants to ensure that the vast majority of the Muslim world hears."" Mideast expert Mamoun Fandy agrees with Egyptians who say Muslims want more than talk; they want action.

"(CNN) -- A man who allegedly threatened to decapitate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii appeared in court Friday in San Diego and was ordered to remain in jail for now. Aniruddha Sherbow made two threats to murder the Democratic congresswoman earlier this month, according to newly unsealed court documents. On August 1 the man allegedly left an expletive-laden voicemail on Gabbard's cell phone, with the message including a threat to her life. An affidavit said that Gabbard had been getting harassing messages from Sherbow since 2011 and identified his voice as the caller. The court document said Sherbow's mother later listened to the recording and told investigators it sounded like her son. On August 3 Sherbow allegedly sent an e-mail to the FBI and some unnamed media outlets and identified himself by name, according to the affidavit. The subject of the e-mail was ""Cutting Off Tulsi Gabbard's Head."" The message said in part, ""I, Aniruddha Sherbow, with the Divine as my witness, do hereby solemnly vow to find Tulsi Gabbard, wheresover she may be, and to sever her head from her body."" According to the court affidavit, Sherbow's father said he received a copy of that e-mail and he identified his son as the sender. The FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police said Thursday that Sherbow's threats were ""deemed credible."" Sherbow, 43, was arrested by Mexican law enforcement officers in Tijuana on Wednesday. The former resident of Hawaii was then turned over to the FBI in San Diego. He faces a charge of transmission of threats in interstate commerce. He is scheduled to have another court hearing on September 12, and officials eventually want him transferred to the District of Columbia for trial. Gabbard's office would not comment on Sherbow's arrest and the allegations against him. Press secretary Heather Fluit would only say the congresswoman was ""grateful for the work"" of all the law enforcement officers involved in the investigation. CNN's Laurie Ure contributed to this report.","Feds: Threats included an expletive-laden voicemail and an e-mail .

"Ottawa, Canada (CNN) -- Guantanamo detainee Omar Khadr has been transferred to his homeland of Canada to serve the remainder of his sentence, Canada's Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said Saturday. Khadr boarded a military plane at the Guantanamo Naval base in Cuba and arrived at a military airbase in Trenton, Ontario. He will serve the rest of his sentence at Millhaven Prison in Bath, Ontario, about 130 miles east of Toronto. The case and the prisoner's legal fate have sparked controversy among Canadians. Many think his sentence has been too lenient. Others, noting his capture at age 15, think he should have been treated as a child soldier and point to alleged mistreatment while in custody. Under a plea deal with military prosecutors in October 2010, Khadr admitted to throwing a grenade during a 2002 firefight in Afghanistan that killed Sgt. First Class Christopher Speer, a member a U.S. Army Special Forces Unit. Youngest Gitmo detainee pleads guilty . He pleaded guilty to murder, attempted murder, providing material support for terrorism, spying and conspiracy. ""This transfer occurs following a process initiated by the United States government and determined in accordance with Canadian law,"" Toews said. ""I am satisfied the Correctional Service of Canada can administer Omar Khadr's sentence in a manner which recognizes the serious nature of the crimes that he has committed and ensure the safety of Canadians is protected during incarceration,"" he said, adding that the Canadian government would have no say in parole proceedings. Khadr statement says he was happy U.S. soldier died in attack . As part the plea deal, Khadr received an eight-year sentence with no credit for time served. Khadr's lawyers say Khadr agreed to the plea deal under the condition that he would serve most of the sentence in Canada. Khadr's lawyers say the transfer was delayed for months as the Canadian government seemed to drag its feet. Earlier this year, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told CNN that Khadr's repatriation would mark a significant step forward in eventually closing Guantanamo. Two senior Obama administration officials said it took about a year to work out arrangements with Canadians for the transfer. Negotiations were a very long and complicated process, and there were extensive conversations with Canadians, one of the officials said. There were a lot of legal hurdles on the U.S. side and clearly hesitation on the part of Canadian government to do this because the public is polarized about Khadr, the official said. Khadr was the only remaining Western detainee at Guantanamo. His repatriation in Canada is highly controversial, due in large part to the views held by his family members. His father, Ahmed Khadr was a close associate of Osama Bin Laden and openly said he believed it was his Islamic duty to train his children in jihad. Human rights groups around the world have denounced Khadr's capture at the age of 15 and his 10-year detention at Guantanamo. ""Given the Obama administration's glacial pace towards closing the U.S.-controlled detention center, little and late though it is, today's news represents progress,"" Amnesty International USA's Executive Director Suzanne Nossel said in a statement. Canada should conduct a full investigation into Khadr's allegations of torture and ""remedy for the human rights violations he suffered,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- A SkyWest Airlines pilot on the run after allegedly killing his former girlfriend last week attempted to steal one of his company's commercial jetliners early Tuesday, but he killed himself before the plane became airborne, authorities said. Police in Colorado and Utah spent all day Tuesday trying to piece together the bizarre incident, which involved a stolen CRJ200 that struck the terminal and parked vehicles at St. George Municipal Airport in Utah. The fugitive was identified as Brian J. Hedglin, 40. SkyWest Airlines said he was on administrative leave. Hedglin apparently used a rug or piece of carpet to scale a barbed wire fence to reach the plane, St. George police said. ""He is going to know exactly how to get into the plane, activate the redundant systems and take that plane off,"" said Capt. James Van Fleet. Brazilian man steals plane, crashes into mall . Hedglin and Christina Cornejo, 39, who was found dead Friday of stab wounds in Colorado Springs, both served in the Colorado Army National Guard, officials said. Cornejo was found at Hedglin's residence, but authorities don't know whether she went there voluntarily or was abducted, Colorado Springs Police spokeswoman Barbara A. Miller told CNN. No passengers were on board the CRJ200, and it was not in service at the time of Tuesday's incident in Utah, the airline said. Hedglin, who joined SkyWest in 2005, was found dead in the plane's aisle from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Van Fleet told reporters. A security officer checking the airport's perimeter shortly before 1 a.m. first saw a motorcycle, its engine still warm. The officer went back to the terminal to check on its registration, police said. The officer saw the aircraft in the parking lot of the airport terminal, its engines still running, said Van Fleet. Several automobiles were damaged. The plane at some point clipped the terminal building and breached a fence, according to CNN Salt Lake City affiliate KSL. St. George city spokesman Marc Mortensen said the pilot reversed the aircraft off the jet bridge before pushing it forward. The left wing clipped the bridge and the plane turned left, scraping the terminal building en route to the parking lot. The aircraft leaked some fuel. Asked why the pilot may have driven to St. George, Van Fleet replied, ""The person who has those answers, unfortunately, is dead."" Van Fleet said, ""I don't think we're any more vulnerable than any other airport,"" but officials said they would review security. Cornejo was found dead after a call from a family member, Colorado Springs police said. The pair were not dating at the time of Cornejo's death, Colorado Springs police said. Hedglin was immediately identified as a suspect. ""Detectives went so far as to contact SkyWest and have them deactivate Mr. Hedglin's access cards in the event he showed up there,"" police said. Police also believed Hedglin might try to hide in mountains, according to Miller. Airline spokeswoman Betsy Talton said law enforcement officials will look into how Hedglin might have gained access to the airplane. SkyWest provided few details on exactly what occurred. ""The aircraft did sustain damage; the extent of the damage is currently being inspected by our maintenance and safety professionals,"" the airline said. ""SkyWest is assisting authorities in the investigation."" SkyWest said passengers were being accommodated on other flights and through ground transportation. The FBI office in Salt Lake City said agents were at the airport and gathering facts with other agencies. ""It is important to note there is no ongoing public safety issue, and the scene is under the control of law enforcement,"" Agent Debbie D. Bertram said. Spokesman David Castelveter of the Transportation Safety Administration said the agency was reviewing ""perimeter compliance"" at the airport. According to Jane's All the World's Aircraft, the CRJ200 typically seats 50 passengers. Plane-stealing 'Barefoot Bandit' sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison .

"(CNN) -- President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Monday as more than 10,000 pro-Israel activists gathered in Washington for the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee Policy Conference. But rather than focusing on the stalled Middle East peace process, their talks and subsequent media coverage have centered on the question of using military force to stop Iran's nuclear program. The events in Washington took place just after 24 Christian, Jewish and Muslim prominent faith leaders from the United States and Indonesia returned from a mission to the Middle East. The joint delegation returned from the birthplace of the three great faiths of the Western world convinced that religion can be a force for unity and understanding instead of a source of division and conflict. Unfortunately, however, concerns about security and safety have made the Holy Land a region of walls that have all but eliminated any contact between Israelis and Palestinians today. In the six days the delegation visited the region, they got a sense of the fear that has led to the building of many kinds of walls. They saw much evidence of the distrust, intolerance and hatred that exists between the two sides of the conflict. But they also met faith leaders and civic activists of great vision and courage. Rabbi Michael Melchior, the founder of Mosaica Center for Inter-Religious Cooperation and a former member of the Israeli Cabinet, is working with Dr. Abdul Rahman Abbad, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Religious Leaders in Palestine, to moderate the views of extremist religious leaders. The delegation met with leaders of Neve Shalom/Wahat al-Salam, which, for more than 40 years, has created a model community of Jewish-Palestinian coexistence, including a School for Peace that has trained thousands of youths and teachers to help create a humane, egalitarian and just society. And they met with leaders of Parents Circle/Bereaved Families Forum who have lost loved ones in the conflict but have turned their anger and loss into constructive work to advance peace. Although many of the American faith leaders in the delegation had some exposure to the Middle East, this was a new experience for our colleagues from Indonesia, which does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. For them, the trip was one of several thousand miles as well as one of cultural and historical assumptions. The Indonesian delegation that participated in our mission deserves credit for doing what so few leaders in the world do today: having the courage to cross a great divide with an open mind to better understand the ""other."" All delegates came to better understand the competing narratives that fuel the conflict in the region. For more than 60 years, a just solution to the Middle East conflict has eluded the greatest statesmen of our time. Perhaps it is time for a different strategy. Let's call it an Abrahamic peace strategy. In the field of conflict resolution, mediators help disputing parties peel back layers of difference until they reach common ground on which both parties can agree. In the Middle East, that common ground is our common ancestor Abraham. Abraham did not build walls. He built wells to sustain all those around him with life-giving water. He did not exclude anyone from his home, opening all four flaps of his desert tent so that any wayfarer, coming from any direction, would feel welcome and share in his hospitality. That is why we are taught that the core character trait of anyone true to the Abrahamic tradition is compassion. No peace plan will ever work in the Middle East until there is a wholehearted commitment to get Christians, Jews and Muslims to recognize that the core values they share from Abraham transcend political ideologies, flags, national anthems and even geography. They must be educated in the same classrooms, join hands in launching social action projects to help the most vulnerable, visit each others' places of worship and then visit each others' homes to drink coffee and become friends. If we could promote projects that bring Israelis and Palestinians face to face, it would begin to plant the seeds for peace for future generations in a way far more enduring than the signing of a treaty by heads of state. Political strategies have failed. Let us try a new strategy, one that goes back to the faith of our common ancestor Abraham. Start with that, and peace will follow.

"(CNN) -- A web video featuring former special forces officers accuses President Barack Obama of taking too much credit for the killing of Osama bin Laden and allowing classified information about the raid to become public. The ad also includes former Navy SEALs. The organization behind the ad, the Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund, has posted the 22-minute web video on its website. A spokeswoman says the group has raised about $1 million toward an advertising campaign in some key swing states. Over a picture of Obama, the video's narrator says that the group's mission is to stop politicians from using sensitive intelligence about the bin Laden raid and other clandestine programs for political benefit. In a series of interviews, former military and intelligence officers accuse Obama of seeking political gain by disclosing successful secret operations. Opinion: To fix leaks, fix culture of secrecy . ""As a citizen, it is my civic duty to tell the president to stop leaking information to the enemy,"" says Benjamin Smith, identified in the video as a former Navy SEAL. ""It will get Americans killed."" Another former Navy SEAL in the video, Scott Taylor, says of the bin Laden raid: ""If you disclose how we got there, how we took down the building, what we did, how many people were there, that it's going to hinder future operations, and certainly hurt the success of those future operations."" Smith also criticizes the president for taking too much credit for the SEALs' raid. ""Mr. President, you did not kill Osama bin Laden. America did,"" he says. ""We have become a political weapon. We are not."" Defense officials: Leaks didn't come from Pentagon . Smith said the ad campaign pays no heed to political affiliation, and the organization describes itself as nonpartisan and says its focus isÂ on protecting intelligence agents and special operations officers, not on politics. But it shares an office with two Republican political consulting firms in Alexandria, Virginia. Its spokesman Chad Kolton worked for the Bush administration as a spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence. Taylor has run for the Republican nomination for Congress in Virginia; Smith said he is a registered Republican but votes independently. As to who is funding the attack, which was first reported by Reuters, a spokeswoman for the organization would not disclose its donors. Darrell West of the Brookings Institution says it is too soon to say whether this campaign could become as successful as the 2004 ""Swift Boat"" advertising campaign, which mounted a barrage of negative attacks on John Kerry's standing as a Vietnam war hero. Video: Obama calls leaks ""offensive"" ""Obama's strong suit actually is on national security. He's the guy who got bin Laden, and that's been a central claim of his campaign. So there's always a risk of the opposition coming in with this type of ad to try to undermine the president's credibility and take away what is really his strong suit,"" he said. West said the video blames Obama for leaks without providing any evidence the leaks are his fault. But still, West said, ""national security is a very sensitive issue for many people, that's an issue that swing voters take very seriously."" In recent campaign speeches, Obama has cited the killing of bin Laden as one of the campaign pledges he has fulfilled. ""I promised to go after al Qaeda and bin Laden, and we did it,"" he told an applauding audience Thursday. The Obama campaign has even produced an ad called ""One Chance"" in which former President Bill Clinton praises Obama for ordering the secret raid to proceed. Toobin: Obama's been ""tough"" on leakers . But Vice President Joe Biden made an effort to share the credit Tuesday as he was offering the crowd a list of the administration's accomplishments. ""The man here pointed out, 'we also got bin Laden,'"" Biden said. ""Let me correct that. The president of the United States and the special forces got bin Laden."" And the head of special operations, Admiral Bill McRaven, a former SEAL himself, recently told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that credit was due to the president. ""At the end of the day,"" he said, ""make no mistake about it: it was the president of the United States that shouldered the burden for this operation, that made the hard decisions."" But like other top officials, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, McRaven was highly critical of the recent leaks about clandestine operations. ""Are lives at risk? Absolutely,"" he said. The White House has denied leaking secret information about clandestine operations, and two federal prosecutors have been assigned to investigate recent leaks about the Stuxnet virus and drone strike operations. But in a recent speech in Reno, Nevada, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called the leaks ""contemptible"" and said they occurred on Obama's watch.","The ad also includes former Navy SEALs .

"Washington (CNN) -- The pharmaceutical company that makes the prescription pain medications Darvon and Darvocet has agreed to withdraw the drugs from the U.S. market at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the FDA said Friday. The FDA says the drug, propoxyphene, puts patients at risk of potentially serious or fatal heart rhythm abnormalities. Since 2009, 10 million people have been prescribed some form of the drug. ""We recommend to physicians stop prescribing the drugs. As for patients, do not stop taking it, but we urge you to contact your health care professional. Do not delay,"" said Gerald Dal Pan, director of the FDA's Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology. Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals Inc. manufactures Darvon and Darvocet, two brand name versions of propoxyphene. The FDA also asked generic makers of the pain medicine to voluntarily remove their products. The decision to remove the drug came after the FDA reviewed a new trial study that looked at the drug's impact on heart rhythms. ""The drug's effectiveness in reducing pain is no longer enough to outweigh the drug's serious potential heart risks,"" the FDA said in a statement released Friday. Propoxyphene, first approved by the FDA in 1957, is an opioid used to treat mild to moderate pain. It is sold under various names both alone, such as Darvon, or in combination with acetaminophen, such as Darvocet. Since 1978, the FDA has received two requests to remove propoxyphene from the market, but concluded that the benefits of propoxyphene for pain relief at recommended doses outweighed the safety risks. CNN's Val Willingham contributed to this report.","Darvon, Darvocet brands pulled along with generics .

"London (CNN) -- Reports coming from Russia suggest that hundreds of people have been injured by a meteor falling from space. The force of the fireball, which seems to have crashed into a lake near the town of Chebarkul in the Ural Mountains, roared through the sky early on Friday morning local time, blowing out windows and damaging buildings. This comes on the same day that astronomers and news reporters alike were turning their attention to a 40 meter asteroid -- known as 2012 DA14 -- which is due for a close approach with Earth on Friday evening. The asteroid will skirt around our planet, however, missing by some 27,000 kilometers (16,777 miles). Based on early reports, there is no reason to believe the two events are connected. Read more: Russian meteor injures hundreds . And yet it just goes to show how much space debris exists up there above our heads. It is easy to think of a serene solar system, with the eight planets quietly orbiting around the Sun and only a few moons for company. The reality is that we also share our cosmic neighborhood with millions of other, much smaller bodies: asteroids. Made of rock and metal, they range in size from a few meters across, up to the largest -- Ceres -- which is 1000 kilometers wide. They are left over rubble from the chaotic birth of our solar system around 5000 million years ago and, for the most part, are found in a ""belt"" between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. But some are known to move away from this region, either due to collisions with other asteroids or the gravitational pull of a planet. And that can bring them into close proximity to the Earth. Read more: Saving Earth from asteroids . Once a piece of space-rock enters our atmosphere, it becomes known as a meteor. Traveling through the sky at a few kilometers per second, friction with the air can cause the meteor to break up into several pieces. Eyewitnesses have described seeing a burst of light and hearing loud, thunderous noises. This, too, is due to the object tearing through the gases above our heads. If any of the fragments make it to the ground, only then are they called meteorites. Such events are rare, but not unprecedented. An object entered Earth's atmosphere in 1908 before breaking up over Siberia. The force of the explosion laid waste to a dense area of forest covering more than 2000 square kilometers. It is not hard to imagine the devastation of such an event over a more highly populated region. The Earth is sprinkled with around 170 craters also caused by debris falling from space. The largest is found near the town of Vredefort in South Africa. The impact of a much larger asteroid -- perhaps as big as 15 kilometers across -- is famously thought to have finished off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Opinion: Don't count 'doomsday asteroid' out yet . It is easy to see why, then, that astronomers are keen to discover the position and trajectory of as many asteroids as possible. That way they can work out where they are heading and when, if at all, they might pose a threat to us on Earth. It is precisely this sort of work that led to the discovery of asteroid 2012 DA14 last February by a team of Spanish astronomers. However, today's meteor strike shows that it is not currently possible to pick up everything. A non-profit foundation, led by former NASA astronaut Ed Lu, wants to send a dedicated asteroid-hunting telescope into space that can scan the solar system for any potential threats. For now, astronomers will use Friday's fly-by to bounce radar beams off 2012 DA14's surface, hoping to learn more about its motion and structure. One day this information could be used to help move an asteroid out of an Earth-impacting orbit. This latest meteor over Russia just goes to show how important such work is and how crucial it is that we keep our eye on the sky. Read more: NASA estimates 4,700 'potentially hazardous' asteroids .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- You're sitting in an airport lounge and seize the chance to check your e-mails before your flight departs. You log on and are tempted by a wireless Internet provider offering free Internet access. So, do you take it? Wi-Fi users have been warned to protect their computers against potential hackers at Wi-Fi hotspots. Security experts warn that hackers may be masquerading as free public Wi-Fi providers to gain access to the laptops of unsuspecting travelers. All it takes, they say, is a computer program downloaded from the Internet, an open access point and a user who has ignored basic security advice. ""The difficulty for travelers is differentiating between a good Internet access hotspot and a rogue, or somebody trying to actually glean credentials from you. The issue is that you don't necessarily know the difference between a good and a bad one,"" computer security expert Sean Remnant told CNN. In 2008, AirTight Networks dispatched a number of so-called ""white hat"" hackers to 27 airports around the world to test the vulnerability of their Wi-Fi systems. They found that 80 percent of the private Wi-Fi networks tested were open or poorly protected. The wireless security company also found that basic services at several airports, including baggage handling systems, were vulnerable to hackers. Operators were using Wired Equivalent Privacy, known as WEP, which was found to provide inadequate protection to hackers as early as 2001. One year after the survey was conducted, CNN Business Traveler met Remnant at London's Heathrow airport, which was not included in the original survey, to test the potential dangers to unprotected Wi-Fi users.  Watch what happened when we took a hacker to Heathrow » . Armed with a laptop, our ""white hat"" hacker took a seat in the crowded departure lounge at Terminal 3 and proceeded to scan the airwaves with his laptop, using a program he downloaded form the Internet called Airodump. ""It dumps everything in the air,"" Remnant explained. ""So if I execute the command to start Airodump, instantly I'm seeing probably 20 wireless networks with four or five of those having relatively weak server security."" ""There are several risks just on this screen,"" he continued. ""One is that we actually don't know whether the public networks are legitimate or not."" The original survey conducted by AirTight Networks found the most common name for rogue Wi-Fi points was ""Free Public Wi-Fi."" ""You'd have no idea if somebody sitting down to a laptop was a casual traveler trying to collect their email from an open port, or actually they were setting up a rogue access point,"" Remnant said. ""Your security guys in the airport aren't going to spot someone doing this because it's a technical thing,"" he added. Once connected, the hacker would have access to everything on your screen, from passwords, to bank account details, to the contents of e-mails. Do you suspect you've been a victim of Wi-Fi hacking? Tell us your story in Sound Off . And it's not just happening at airports. The rapid spread of Wi-Fi networks to cafes, hotels and even entire cities is providing hackers with more opportunities to ply their trade. Last month, Venice rolled out what is believed to be Europe's most extensive Wi-Fi network. According to mobile media company Jiwire, there are now more than 273,000 free and pay Wi-Fi locations in 140 countries. The majority can be found in the United States, China, the United Kingdom and France. And most hotspots are located in hotels, along with cafes and restaurants. However, the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industry group that tests and certifies Wi-Fi equipment, says the increased availability of Wi-Fi has not led to a rise in hacking cases. ""We certainly haven't seen any kind of sudden epidemic of hackers in open hotspots or anything like that,"" said the group's marketing director, Kelly Davis-Felner. She said all Wi-Fi enabled devices have in-built security measures, and all users need to do is to switch them on. The most up-to-date wireless security system is WPA2, which provides greater protection than its predecessors WPA and WEP. ""If you're updating Facebook, or checking your personal e-mail or surfing the Web, there's really no reason at all to worry about using an open network,"" Davis-Felner said. ""Any kind of online shopping or banking or anything that would require you to exchange sensitive data over the airwaves, then we advise people to exercise caution."" The best way to protect sensitive information is to use a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which encrypts the data moving to and from your laptop. Kiran Deshpande, president of AirTight Networks, had this advice for travelers: ""Connect only to the networks that you trust. Make sure that your communication is secure, disconnect the wireless when you stop using it, and maintain the list of wireless connections that you use on your laptop so that you don't accidentally connect to networks that may spring up when you're traveling.""","Security experts warn Wi-Fi users to be more vigilant against hackers .
Experts say it's difficult to distinguish between legitimate and rogue networks .

"Madrid (CNN) -- The alleged leader of an Islamic militant cell in Spain who escaped arrest in June when eight of his suspected colleagues were detained has been taken into custody, the Spanish Interior Ministry said Monday. The suspect, Yassin Ahmed Laarbi, a Spaniard, was arrested Monday in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta on Morocco's north coast, where the eight other suspects also were detained on June 21, an Interior Ministry statement said. The suspected cell was ""a structure based in Spain, with connections in Morocco, Belgium, Turkey and Syria, dedicated to radicalizing, recruiting and sending mujahedeen (fighters) to Syria with the aim of conducting jihad and achieving martyrdom,"" according to a court order issued in June. In that order, Judge Ismael Moreno of Spain's National Court ruled that the eight suspected Islamic militants should remain in prison on preliminary charges alleging membership in a terrorist group. The group has connections to the Jabhat al-Nusra front, described as an active al Qaeda group in and around Syria, and to the Iraq Islamic State in Iraq, but ""there are increasing references to carrying out jihad at home,"" the judge warned at the time, referring to potential attacks in Spain.

At least five died in suicide attacks in Syria that caused numerous casualties. One of the males was a minor; it was not immediately clear if he was among those who had died. Some of the eight suspects intended to go to Syria, the judge added. Monday's Interior Ministry statement said that Laarbi also ""was a candidate to join up with those terrorist groups in Syria."" He was not at his home June 21 when the other suspects were arrested, the statement said. The judge's order in June identified the suspected leader as Spaniard Karin Abdeselam Mohamed, 39. But the Interior Ministry statement on Monday said Laarbi was the ""suspected maximum leader"" of the cell. Spanish police in June said the suspected cell was based in Ceuta and in the nearby Moroccan city of Fnideq.

"(CNN) -- More than three weeks after his son was last seen, the father of a missing University of Florida student said Saturday the family is ready to begin the grieving process, confident that the 18-year-old's body has been found. ""We, as a family, believe that Christian has been found and our prayers have been heard,"" Carlos Aguilar told reporters, as his tearful wife put her head down on a table and then cried into her husband's shoulder. Gainesville Police spokesman Ben Tobias said authorities are looking into a body that was recently found. But it hasn't been confirmed that this body, found in Levy County, is that of Christian Aguilar. Carlos Aguilar stressed that his family is waiting on confirmation of the body's identity. Even so, he said that he believed they'll soon be able ""to bring Christian back home"" and have his funeral. ""Our family is going to be grieving until the authorities give us the confirmation,"" the father said. Christian Aguilar, 18, was last seen on September 20. Eight days later, Pedro Bravo was charged with first-degree murder in the student's apparent death. Bravo initially had told investigators he got into ""an altercation with Aguilar"" the night the college student went missing, police said. The suspect said he then left Aguilar in a parking lot in the central Florida city, prompting police to warn that Aguilar may have been disoriented and/or seriously injured. Aguilar's father told CNN affiliate WCJB that his son disappeared after a fight over a girl. Bravo, who is also 18, changed his account of what happened ""after being confronted with evidence that disputed his initial statements,"" Tobias said late last month. Aguilar's backpack was found inside a suitcase in Bravo's closet, according to Tobias. At the time, the police spokesman said that blood found in several locations in Bravo's vehicle would undergo an expedited analysis and be compared against known DNA samples of Aguilar. Authorities have used helicopters and K-9 units to search for Aguilar. His relatives plastered the area with fliers, used Twitter to generate leads and invited a nonprofit search group to help look for him alongside family members and police. On Saturday, Carlos Aguilar made a point to thank ""every single person,"" including scores of volunteers, who ""supported our family during this horrible time, during this pain, during this agony."" According to CNN affiliate WJXT, hunters in a rural part of Levy County found human remains Friday and notified police in Gainesville, about an hour away.

"(CNN) -- Ethnic Tibetans' ability to thrive in high altitudes with low oxygen is the fastest genetic change ever observed in humans, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science. Researchers at the University of California-Berkeley said their comparison of the genomes of ethnic Tibetan and Han Chinese could help scientists understand how the body deals with decreased oxygen and diseases associated with oxygen deprivation in the womb, according to a news release on the university's website. The evolutionary biologists say the results of their study, which compares the genomes of 50 Tibetans and 40 Han Chinese, shows that Tibetans rapidly developed a unique ability to survive in altitudes above 13,000 feet, where oxygen levels are about 40 percent lower than at sea level. The study said that Tibetans evolved to adapt to high altitudes after splitting off from the Han about 2,750 years ago. The study identified more than 30 genes with DNA mutations that have become more prevalent in Tibetans than Han Chinese, nearly half of which are related to how the body uses oxygen. ""For such a very strong change, a lot of people would have had to die simply due to the fact that they had the wrong version of a gene,"" said Rasmus Nielsen, a professor of integrative biology at Berkeley who led the statistical analysis.","Ethnic Tibetans took less than 3,000 years to adapt to high altitudes, study says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration has selected 43 more technology specialists as Presidential Innovation Fellows to help the government devise new ways to operate better and save money, President Barack Obama announced Monday. The new fellows follow an initial group of 18 chosen last year who came up with ways to digitize disaster recovery efforts, make more government data available to the public for free, and eliminate duplication while speeding up the adoption of new technology by government agencies, Obama told a White House event attended by most of his Cabinet. Citing what he called a 21st century government still mired in some ways in 20th century technology, the president also challenged his Cabinet to develop aggressive management strategies to upgrade systems and operations. ""We've found ways to deliver the services that citizens expect in smarter, faster and better ways,"" Obama said of first term successes, citing improved methods of processing disaster claims through mobile apps and saving $2.5 billion by eliminating duplication and waste when upgrading government technology."" ""It makes sense for us to be able to redesign government so it can deliver on the functions the American people are looking for,"" he said. For example, he mentioned one idea ""in the pipeline"" that would allow people filing for federal benefits to track the status of their application ""just like you can follow the location of a package all the way to your doorstep."" Obama said Sylvia Matthews Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, would oversee the effort, which he said would extend to the general public to become more involved in helping improve government. ""In this democracy, we the people recognize that this government belongs to us, and it's up to each of us and every one of us to make it work better,"" he said. ""We can't just stand on the sidelines. We can't take comfort in just being cynical. We all have a stake in government success because the government is us.""

"Washington (CNN) -- An FBI counterterrorism official said Wednesday that the FBI should have interviewed accused Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan when it learned Hasan was communicating via e-mail with Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen. ""I believe an interview would have been prudent in this case,"" said Mark Giuliano, executive assistant director for the FBI's national security branch. But he added he didn't think ""political correctness"" was the reason Hasan was not interviewed and he said an interview may not have headed off the tragedy in which Hasan is accused of killing 13 and wounding 32 others in November 2009. Giuliano is the first FBI official to testify before Congress since an independent commission's report was made public on July 19 that examined how the FBI handled information that came up while the agency was investigating al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric who U.S. officials say became a key figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Some members of Congress have questioned whether the FBI and military officials acted aggressively enough when officials learned Hasan was e-mailing al-Awlaki starting in December of 2008. The commission, headed by former FBI Director William Webster, said that members of a joint terrrorism task force in San Diego had passed the information on to FBI officials in Washington and were upset no one from the FBI's Washington field office had been sent to interview Hasan. Fort Hood shooting report faults FBI handling of accused shooter's emails . According to the commission report, one of the San Diego agents said he had been told by Washington that the field office there ""doesn't go out and interview every Muslim guy who visits extremist websites."" The San Diego agent, who was paraphrasing a phone conversation with a counterpart in Washington, said the field office had examined Army records regarding Hasan and knew he was doing research on Islam and military service while he was at Walter Reed Medical Center. ""This guy has a legitimate work-related reasons to be going to these sites and engaging these extremists in dialogue,"" the San Diego agent said he was told by Washington. Furthermore, the San Diego agent said the agent in Washington described the subject as ""politically sensitive"" for the Washington office. Hasan and al-Awlaki exchanged 18 e-mails between December 2008 and June 2009, but the task force in San Diego only passed two of the messages on to Washington, according to the Webster report. In a hearing before a House appropriations subcommittee, Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, worried that political correctness might have been an issue and said he would still like to talk to officials at the FBI's Washington field office about what happened. ""An active duty member of the military communicating with a known radicalizer and recruiter should have been taken more seriously than it was,"" said Wolf. Missed clues in massacre? Wolf also wanted to know exactly what the FBI knew about al-Awlaki at the time Hasan was e-mailing with him and if al-Awlaki had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks since he had served in mosques in a Washington suburb and in San Diego where a few of the 9/11 hijackers had gone to worship. ""We interviewed al-Awlaki after 9/11 on three separate occasions,"" said Giuliano. ""He identified one of the 9/11 hijackers as somebody he knew as going to his mosque. We were never able to obtain a stitch of evidence that showed al-Awlaki knew beforehand about 9/11 or supported the 9/11 hijackers."" Wolf also asked why al-Awlaki was allowed to return to the United States in 2002 when there was an arrest warrant issued for him that was subsequently dropped. Guiliano said it was not an FBI arrest warrant but a warrant from the State Department's diplomatic security service for passport fraud. He said the U.S. attorney's office in Colorado concluded the charge couldn't be proven in court. ""Certainly, if we felt that warrant was good and there was a way we could have incarcerated Anwar al-Awlaki at the time, we would have done that,"" said Guiliano. Guiliano also noted that al-Awlaki seemed to change over the years, including a period in 2006 and 2007 when he was in prison in Yemen. After that, the FBI official said, al-Awlaki ""began to be more of a propagandist, began to show more radical tendencies."" Hasan's e-mail exchange with al-Awlaki; Islam, money and matchmaking . But he added the FBI did not believe he was involved in terrorist operations at that time. U.S. officials believe al-Awlaki played an important role in the failed December 2009 underwear bomb plot and also the thwarted October 2010 cargo bomb plot. Al-Awlaki was killed September 30, 2011, by a drone strike in Yemen. The Webster report on the Fort Hood shooting identified numerous problems in several areas including information sharing, failure to follow up on leads, failure of FBI headquarters to settle differences between the two field offices working the Hasan leads and computer technology issues. Guiliano and other FBI officials said they began making changes right after the Fort Hood shooting. Hasan is scheduled to undergo a military trial beginning August 20 in Texas.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Wisconsin federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new and restrictive abortion law. The law, signed by Gov. Scott Walker on Friday, bans doctors from performing abortions if they don't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice. U.S. District Judge William Conley granted the hold Monday after the Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed suit. The group alleges the admitting privilege requirement is unconstitutional and treats doctors who perform abortions differently from doctors who perform other types of medical procedures. Conley agreed. ""There is a troubling lack of justification for the hospital admitting privileges requirement,"" he wrote in his 19-page ruling. He added that the U.S. Supreme Court precedent places the burden upon states to show such laws are ""reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health."" To that end, ""the record to date strongly supports a finding that no medical purpose is served by this requirement,"" he said. The restraining order will stay in place pending a fuller hearing on July 17. The law, which took effect Monday, also requires women to have an ultrasound before getting an abortion, but that portion of the law was not challenged in the Planned Parenthood suit. Opponents of the Wisconsin legislation allege that restrictions in the law would force the closing of several abortion clinics, and that the law is simply a way to make access to abortions more difficult. Supporters insist that it would guarantee a safer environment for a woman suffering from abortion-related complications. Judge Conley questioned that contention, saying, ""The current system already handles efficiently the very low percentage of women seeking abortions with serious complications.""

"(CNN) -- The question of Jewish resistance to the Nazis -- or the lack of it -- has loomed large ever since the true extent of the horrors of the Holocaust became impossible to ignore. Liev Schreiber, left, and Daniel Craig play Jewish resistance fighters in the World War II drama ""Defiance."" As early as 1940 and 1942, Charlie Chaplin and Ernst Lubitsch fashioned satiric fantasies in which Adolf Hitler was comically humiliated by Jews (a barber in Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" and a hammy actor in Lubitsch's ""To Be or Not to Be""). More recently, Steven Spielberg and Roman Polanski presented authentic stories of Jewish Holocaust survivors in ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist."" In ""Defiance,"" Edward Zwick tells the true story of the Bielski brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell). When the Germans and local collaborators started rounding up Jews in what was then Belorussia in 1941, murdering thousands -- including the Bielskis' parents -- the three men took refuge in the woods. They evaded capture, scavenged, begged or stole the food they needed; they set up a camp and saved hundreds of fellow refugees -- and they fought back.  Watch the stars of ""Defiance"" talk about the film » . It's a remarkable story, one that should have inspired a more exciting and original movie than this sluggish compendium of earnest debates and hackneyed battle scenes. The timing is unfortunate. For a story that has gone neglected for the best part of 60 years, this is hardly the ideal week to be extolling heroic Jewish resistance fighters. Ari Folman's angst-laden nonfiction animated film, ""Waltz With Bashir,"" is altogether more relevant. Zwick's Hollywood liberal credentials are not in doubt, but his films have a surprisingly gung-ho undercurrent (they include such martial adventures as ""The Last Samurai,"" ""Glory,"" ""The Siege,"" ""Legends of the Fall"" and ""Courage Under Fire""). He may like a fight, but he's no great shakes when it comes to staging action. Besides, in a Zwick flick, words always speak louder. In ""Defiance"" those words come with a thick, guttural European inflection (Hebrew is spoken as English, though characters also break into subtitled Russian and German on occasion). The speechifying is often clumsy and long-winded. Take the backwoods intellectual who doesn't know how to handle a hammer but can sure nail a philosophical one-liner: ""At least Descartes recognized the subjective nature of existence,"" he kvetches. Where's Lubitsch when you need him? Dour and dourer as the movie goes on, Daniel Craig looks rugged in a weathered leather jacket and cloth cap, but his Bond associations aren't exactly helpful. You have to check yourself from wondering why he doesn't just take out that battalion of Nazis single-handedly. Tuvia may be a reluctant hero, but he shoulders the burden of leadership and assumes responsibility for protecting his ever-increasing flock. Schreiber's Zus, on the other hand, joins with the Soviets to take the fight to the Germans. It takes him longer to learn who his true friends are. The movie is full of mud and muck, yet somehow Zwick sanitizes the things that matter most. In the most challenging scene, just as Tuvia turns a blind eye as his enraged fellow Jews beat a German prisoner to death, Zwick consistently pulls back from anything that might be too unpleasant or tasteless. His heroes remain fundamentally unsullied. Later Asael picks up Tuvia's mantle and leads his followers like a latter-day Moses, away from their enemies through an impenetrable swamp. ""Defiance"" is a hard slog, at times. But even if it's heavy-handed and old-fashioned, there's also something satisfyingly solid about it. It's always comforting to know who the good guys are, even if they're stuck in a not-so-good picture. ""Defiance"" is rated R and runs 137 minutes.

"(CNN) -- Fox's longtime singing competition ""American Idol"" is embroiled in a lawsuit brought by 10 African-American former contestants who say they were unfairly dismissed from the show because of their race. Their complaint was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that ""American Idol"" producers unlawfully acquired information about contestants' criminal backgrounds for both black and white contestants but then used whatever they found solely against black finalists. If the arrest records of white ""Idol"" finalists were made public, the suit alleges that they conversely were ""championed as models of redemption."" The suit accuses the producers of using criminal background checks to ""systematically disqualify and publicly humiliate"" black ""Idol"" finalists as a ratings ploy, perpetuating stereotypes along the way. It contends that while there ""were three times as many White (or non-black) contestants featured on 'American Idol'"" since it began in 2002, ""there has never been a single White (or non-black) contestant disqualified"" from the series. Fox and ""Idol"" production company FremantleMedia have so far declined CNN's request for comment. The 10 plaintiffs include Jaered Andrews (season 2), Corey Clark (season 2), Jacob John Smalley (season 2), Donnie Williams (season 3), Terrell and Derrell Brittenum (season 5), Thomas Daniels (season 6), Akron Watson (season 6), Ju'Not Joyner (season 8)and Chris Golightly (season 9). Each former contestant is seeking $25 million in damages for ""economic injuries, lost business opportunities and/or lost earning potential"" following their dismissal from ""Idol."" Their attorney, James H. Freeman, said the exit of season 11 contestant Jermaine Jones inspired him to take the case. In 2012, Jones was disqualified from ""Idol"" for allegedly concealing ""multiple crimes and outstanding police warrants,"" but Jones isn't a part of the current lawsuit. In an interview with CNN, Jones said he had a ""really good experience"" as a contestant, although he disagrees with the way he was kicked off the show. ""I think that they handled (the situation) the way they wanted to handle the situation. Do I agree with it? Of course not. I would love to have been on the show to be able to compete,"" Jones said. ""But you know I take the highs and the lows, the good and the bad."" When he was asked to be a part of the lawsuit, Jones said he declined. ""I'm grateful for the whole experience. You know, the good parts, the bad parts -- it all made me who I am, and it helped enhance and cultivate me as a person (and) as a musician, as an artist, as a performer. I'm just moving forward."" During the 12 seasons of ""American Idol,"" four African-American contestants have won: Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Jordin Sparks (who is biracial) and Candice Glover.

"(CNN) -- Call them the ""Meh-mmys."" Sure, when it comes to television's most prestigious award, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences tries. When the center of gravity moved to cable, the Emmys followed, giving ""The Sopranos,"" ""The Shield"" and ""Mad Men"" the same kind of attention it once gave ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""Picket Fences."" When new genres and new technology arose, the Academy responded, creating categories for reality shows and ""short-format live-action entertainment programs"" (i.e., online video). And it's hard to argue with this year's nominees. Even the most questionable of the bunch -- ""Mad Men,"" ""The Big Bang Theory,"" Al Pacino's love it-or-hate it turn as Phil Spector -- represent a level of professionalism and quality that should be acknowledged. Then why do the 65th Primetime Emmys feel so ... meh? One reason is the same-old, same-old factor: that the Emmys tend to nominate the same shows (or the same types of shows) every year, says longtime awards watcher Tom O'Neil of Goldderby.com. ""TV is infamous for its reruns -- that's the nature of the boob tube -- and it's hard to whip up excitement when the same contenders return year after year,"" he says. For example, he points out, this year there's only one new show among the 12 nominees for best drama and best comedy, and that's ""House of Cards,"" which came from a non-network, Netflix. (Another show, FX's ""Louie,"" was nominated for the first time, though it just concluded its third season.) 'House of Cards' creator Beau Willimon plays a solid hand . Grantland's TV critic, Andy Greenwald, adds a corollary to O'Neil's observation. Nowadays, there's so much worthwhile programming out there that the Emmys, even when nominating good shows, feel safe and conservative -- and, therefore, somewhat dull. ""For the most part, the Emmys do a pretty good job considering the impossibility and the ridiculousness of their task,"" he said. The new, new TV golden age . He compares the awards with the two other major entertainment honors, the Oscars and Grammys. The former are often so hidebound to prestige productions -- you know the kind -- that they make us angry, Greenwald says. The latter awards, on the other hand, are so absurd that they make us laugh. And the Emmys? ""They get under our skin in a different way, because they come so close,"" he said. ""We often think that they should be getting it right, and they're awfully near to doing it."" Everyone's a critic . Indeed, it's often more fun -- especially in these days of 500 channels and a comparable number of interesting shows -- to single out the so-called snubs. There are the obvious ones, of course. ""Justified"" didn't make it. Neither did ""Sons of Anarchy,"" ""Parks and Recreation,"" ""The Americans"" and ""The Walking Dead."" Emmys 2013: Who got snubbed? But there are also several other shows that missed out in lesser categories. For example, A&E's ""Duck Dynasty"" is hugely popular and, given the hazy reality and clever editing of ""reality"" shows, obviously well-crafted. It was completely ignored by the Emmys. And if ""Duck Dynasty"" is the kind of heartland-favored show sneered at by critics (though, counter to perceptions, many have praised it), what about BBC America's ""Orphan Black""? It's well-written and features a bravura performance by Tatiana Maslany as several clones with distinct personalities. It also garnered zero nominations. Fans on Twitter were not happy. (But what else is new?) As EOnline's Tierney Bricker said in reviewing the nominations, ""It's Emmy season, time for nominations that come with no rhyme or reason!"" But even Greenwald, who wryly notes that he's a ""professional TV watcher,"" finds it hard to keep up. There's so much to live-blog and track that a show like ""Orphan Black"" can slip through the cracks until, suddenly, there's an outcry, he says. ""People who are more plugged in than I am, maybe they were a little late in discovering a show that launched in January,"" he said. ""It's a testament to the way the culture works now, that it sort of trickled down and people can discover something months after it debuted."" And it's a good indicator of how much good stuff there is for the watching, he adds. ""You have to look at the positives. This year, people are taking for granted that Louis C.K. got nominated or 'Top of the Lake,' "" he said. ""I think the arguments people are making for snubs this year were a little ticky-tack and reflected how things like Twitter have made us all TV critics."" 'Mass' or 'class'? This doesn't mean the Emmys can't provide negative indicators, though. The most notable is, of course, the struggle for broadcast network shows to make the Emmy cut. For all of the discussion about audience declines and new paradigms, the broadcast networks still draw relatively large audiences for their biggest hits. ""NCIS,"" for example, draws more than 20 million people a week, and even ""Grey's Anatomy,"" which has been in a slow audience decline for years, still pulls 11 million viewers each week. However, of the 12 shows nominated for best comedy and best drama, only three are on commercial broadcast networks. (A fourth, ""Downton Abbey,"" is on PBS.) It's the cable shows, with their hard-core fan bases and chattering-class chatter, that get most of the buzz. That doesn't necessarily help boost ratings for the Emmy Awards, which try to appeal to all TV watchers. It's the same problem the Oscars face when the Motion Picture Academy nominates a bunch of worthy, but low-grossing, films: Without the draw of blockbuster nominees, water-cooler interest wanes. (And so do ratings.) But the broadcast networks haven't helped their cause, says Greenwald. ""The real tragedy is the way the networks have not been able to make the pivot,"" he said. ""What they do best is reach as many people as possible, but what they've been doing is either reaching for the lowest common denominator or trying to lurch themselves into being like cable, which never works out well for anyone."" In picking the winners, the Television Academy has also risked alienating its audience, says O'Neil. ""The one thing you can usually count on with Emmy voting is unabashed elitism and snobbism,"" he said. The shows that win, he points out, are ""highly styled, very upscale, aspirational shows."" That explains why a show like ""Roseanne,"" the top-rated sitcom that won a slew of other honors during its long run -- including a Peabody -- never won the Emmy for best comedy series. With its brassy lead and working-class setting, ""It represented all the things that made (Emmy voters) disgusted,"" O'Neil said. Expect the unexpected . What could raise interest in the Emmys? The show could add more nominees to its major categories, as the Oscars have done for best picture. That would allow it to welcome a broader range of shows, whether low-rated but passionately watched programs such as ""Orphan Black"" or popular, well-crafted but overlooked dramas such as ""Blue Bloods."" But an even more intriguing idea would be to have an additional category -- call it ""Outstanding Series"" or ""Show of the Year"" -- that throws every major nominee, as well as some fan picks, into the mix. It could be the Emmy equivalent of the NCAA basketball tournament or the Grammys' many-genre album of the year category. Greenwald likes the idea. ""I think it would be a very good reflection of how we watch TV now,"" he said. ""That would be fascinating to watch."" But, in the meantime, we'll just have to make do with the nominees and categories we have, not the nominees and categories we want. Goldderby's O'Neil, for one, doesn't expect too many surprises: ""Breaking Bad"" for best drama, ""Modern Family"" for best comedy and the usual bunch of trophies for HBO -- which won 20 on Sunday at the Creative Arts Emmys, where many categories were presented. (CNN's original series ""Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown"" won two awards.) And, despite the presence of host Neil Patrick Harris, ratings may take a beating, thanks to a face-off against TV's No. 1 show -- that would be NBC's ""Sunday Night Football"" -- and the penultimate episode of ""Breaking Bad"" on AMC. But, O'Neil adds, you never know. There are any number of tea leaves that indicate one thing and then don't pan out at all. It's enough to actually create some excitement. ""You stop using logic,"" he said. ""This is the Emmys."" The 65th Emmy Awards are scheduled to air Sunday on CBS from Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre.","The Emmy Awards often fall short of capturing fan excitement for certain shows .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Everyone has heard of the worm at the bottom of the bottle, but what customs officials in Miami found kicked that up a few notches. Customs officials in Miami seized what they believe is ""snake wine,"" poisonous snakes bottled in alcohol. United States Customs and Border Protection officers conducting a routine inspection on Wednesday seized a cobra and other poisonous snakes in a bottle believed to be ""snake wine."" Customs officials said the snakes, mixed in a glass container containing some form of alcohol, were inside an express mail package from Thailand. Jose Castellano, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency discovered the bizarre beverage during the course of what otherwise would have been an ordinary search. As strange as the tale might seem, Castellano said it was just another day at the office. ""We're not just at airports checking passports,"" said Castellano, whose officers also confiscated cocaine hidden in a diaper the same day they found the snake wine. ""We check mail, boats and planes to make sure that anything that can be harmful or illegal does not enter the United States,"" he said. ""Based on a risk management system, we decide what packages we look at, depending on where they are from, and a lot of different characteristics that would cause us to look into something,"" Castellano said. The investigation into the unusual cocktail is being handled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Importing cobras into the United States is illegal because they are an endangered species. ""It is wildlife that was not declared,"" said Eddie McKissick, a spokesman. ""The issue is that this species of snake is protected by the convention on international trade in endangered species. It applies to live and dead animals."" ""We see this all the time,"" he added. ""Not just the cobras, sometimes it's turtles and even dried sea horses."" Customs officials said the practice of producing an alcoholic beverage that includes a whole venomous snake in the bottle originated in Vietnam and is popular in Southeast Asia. Officials said the entire snake is submerged in the alcohol, often with insects or other animals such as turtles. The snakes, preferably venomous, are not usually preserved for their meat, but to have the snake poison dissolved in the liquor, which is then used for medicinal purposes, officials said. Federal officials said the package was shipped from Thailand to an address in the southeastern United States. Authorities declined to reveal where or to whom the package was destined. ""We're still gathering facts and haven't determined a course of action,"" McKissick said. The package, like all international mail, was inspected when it reached the regional Customs inspection site in the area for which it is destined. Once inspected, mail is turned over to the U.S. Postal system. McKissick said importation of endangered species into the United States requires a permit and proper procedures have to be followed. ""If you have a demand for a wildlife species, someone has to go out and kill that species, so the regulations apply,"" he said. ""These species require an export permit that they did not have.""","Customs officials seize container of poisonous snakes in alcohol .

Maduro arrived Thursday in Cuba to attend celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the start of the Cuban revolution. Castro wasn't at the ceremony, which was officiated by his brother, Cuban President Raul Castro. Fidel Castro has made infrequent public appearances following an intestinal illness in 2006 that forced him to step down. According to the official Cuban government site Cubadebate, Maduro gave Castro a painting by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, who died in March of cancer, and Castro gave Maduro a letter for the heads of state who had attended the anniversary of the revolution. In the letter titled ""I Lived to Fight,"" Castro mentions the recent scandal involving Cuban weapons discovered hidden on a North Korean freighter trying to cross the Panama Canal. ""In recent days there were attempts to defame our revolution,"" Castro wrote, according to the Juventud Rebelde newspaper, which published the text of the letter. ""Trying to make our head of state and government appear as if they were tricking the United Nations and other heads of state and were guilty of being two-faced."" After Panamanian authorities seized the North Korean ship, Cuba admitted to sending MiG fighter jets, missiles and anti-aircraft systems aboard the ship, which also carried 10,000 tons of Cuban sugar. The arms, Cuba's Foreign Ministry said, were ""obsolete"" weapons to be repaired in North Korea and returned to the Caribbean island for defensive use. Panama has asked for assistance from the United Nations, United States and Britain to determine whether the shipment violated a U.N. ban on sending weapons to North Korea.","Ex-Cuban leader Fidel Castro greets Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, state media say .

"(CNN) -- Lucky fans were treated to the first ever footage from upcoming teen dystopic film ""Divergent"" at Comic-Con yesterday. The primary cast of the film, as well as director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and book author Veronica Roth, spoke about the film's potential as the so-called next ""Hunger Games"" and offered hints about what's to come from the franchise. The futuristic film stars Shailene Woodley as a teenager named Tris who is forced to decide between the societal faction her family belongs to and the one she feels is right for her. It will be released in theaters on March 21, 2014. Woodley, who finished filming only two days prior to Comic-Con, is already preparing for the wash of fame that will follow should the movie be a success. Harrison Ford talks 'Ender's Game' ""I did audition for 'The Hunger Games' back in the day,"" Woodley told reporters at a press conference on Thursday, July 18. ""Jennifer Lawrence actually helped me with 'Divergent' because I asked her to tell me how her life has changed from going from small indie movies to something as big as 'Hunger Games.' And she gave me really beautiful advice saying how much she appreciated it and how much it's changed her life in positive ways. She really helped me on this journey."" The actress cited filming the book's integral scene on Chicago's famous Navy Pier -- Ferris wheel as her favorite moment in the film -- as well as one of her favorite moments in her life. The big-budget, action-based picture is a far cry from some of Woodley's previous roles, which include ""The Descendents"" and next month's ""The Spectacular Now."" For the actress and her co-stars, many of whom are largely unknown actors, ""Divergent"" was a chance to experience new methods of filmmaking. ""Green-screen acting is by far way more difficult than human interaction,"" Woodley said. ""I'd never done a movie of this scale before with themes that are somewhat different than the world we live in today. So it was challenging for me I found because I had to erase my previous notions of acting, which is generally reacting off of somebody else, and create a new world and adapt my style of artistry to what we were doing."" An adaptation of the series' second book, ""Insurgent,"" is expected for 2015. Roth said she has been present on set and feels that the film remains true to her original text. The author confirmed that the final book, ""Allegiant,"" will be written from two perspectives: Tris and her love interest Four, who is played in the film by Theo James. But since the third book in the series will be released October 22, 2013, the actors and filmmakers still don't know the final fate of the characters. ""Not everyone on this panel lives,"" said Miles Teller, who plays Peter, as he motioned to the 10 cast members at the press conference. ""But I'm excited.""

"(CNN) -- After a chance introduction by a mutual friend more than two decades ago, Alec Baldwin dedicated much of his rare free time to helping Paul Newman fulfill his dream of making the lives of some children just a little brighter. Newman founded a summer camp for seriously ill kids that he named the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp after the gang in his film ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" He believed that children facing grave illnesses and very grown-up realities should have a special hideout where they could just be kids for a while. Newman died in 2008, but the camp -- now in its 25th year -- carries on his mission and legacy with a bit of help from some of his famous friends, like Baldwin. When Newman was alive, he and Baldwin and several of the acting legend's other famous friends would gather at the camp to entertain. ""We would come up here and do really horrible shows, variety shows. Newman and his friends would write the most awful comedy sketches you've ever heard in your life, and we'd come up here, and we'd just do them without any shame. And people loved it,"" Baldwin said. Now, Baldwin feels that his role is more of helping fill the void left by Newman when it comes to ensuring that the camp thrives for the children who so badly need this escape, now and for years to come. ""I think the thing that's robbed from these kids is a childhood, which is maybe not, you know, worry-free, but less worry. Childhood is when you should have less of the tough things in life and the difficult things in life, and these kids have an excess of the difficult things in life, the tough things in life. And when they come to the camp, they have a childhood on so many levels,"" Baldwin said. At any one time, the camp can take 120 children -- free of charge -- with illnesses such as cancer, blood diseases and disorders and metabolic diseases. ""The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp is a sanctuary for seriously ill children where they can forget about their illness and get back in touch with what it means to be a child,"" camp CEO Jimmy Canton said. ""The children that come to the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp do anything a child would do at a typical camp. It's just that we modify all of our activities to make sure that they are totally included and every activity is accessible to their needs. So there's fishing, boating, theater, arts and crafts, wood shop, horses, clowning, sports and rec, camping out. You name it; we do it. ""What the children, I think, get out of camp the most is that is a sense of community and a sense of acceptance, and in their regular lives they feel totally isolated, and they so often are living on the margins. But at camp, they're surrounded by 120 other children that have walked in their shoes, down similar paths. And they look around and that affirmation, that understanding, that sense of safety is. Is so much greater than I think anyone could ever expect when they walk into the hole in the wall gang camp."" And according to 11-year-old Cameron Merritt, that's exactly what happens when he comes to camp each summer. ""I know I'm at a camp that's really fun and that I can have a good time at. I don't think about the hospital, and I don't think about cancer. Even though there may be kids there who are sick, I still don't think about it."" A big part of the camp's success is its ability to handle the children's needs medically. It has an infirmary staffed with 15 nurses and three or four full-time physicians at all times, as well as a full team of very passionate staff. ""One of the things about the camp I love is that, yes, there are celebrity friends of Newman's, over the many years they've done this, have come up here, but the people who really, really make the difference are the staff. And it's just the most beautiful group of people. Hole in the Wall is different, because Newman was different, and people loved him, and they love his wife, and he pulled people in who were like him, who were drawn to him like a magnet, you know, to give and to stay dedicated,"" Baldwin said. The camp has served children for 25 years due in great part to the donations it receives, big and small. Through the years, it has attracted a few sponsors to host big fundraising events like the Travelers Championship because the magic of the camp is contagious, as tournament director Nathan Grube explains. ""The first time I went out to camp, I didn't know what to expect, and actually I was very busy at the time, and I was on my phone, and one of the children started speaking about their experience at camp, and I hung up my phone, and I settled in, and I started listening, and I just started crying. This child was sharing how impactful camp was to him. And then the parents were sitting there too, saying 'it meant so much to us to see our child be so affected by this.' I was completely hooked. And our whole team with Travelers tournament, we feel so fortunate to be able to give them the money because of what they do and what it means to kids and what it means to the parents to see the transformation in those kids."" But Baldwin is aware that even with big donors, it will take long-term support to serve 120 children at a time for nine sessions each summer, as well as continue outreach programs at hospitals and maintain the other camps across the country -- eight in all -- that now fall under the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp umbrella. He feels the weight of carrying on what Newman began and feels it's his mission to carry the torch. ""I really get choked up when I've thought about what Newman's done. It's so singular, and if people send five bucks or 10 bucks and sign on and support the work that's being done here, it's probably the greatest cause I've seen in my life.""","Paul Newman founded the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp for seriously ill children in 1988 .

"(CNN) -- The main road connecting the Syrian capital of Damascus with the city's airport was open, but no flights were operating Friday, according to an opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Fighting between rebels and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad disrupted much of the capital, and there was no Internet service throughout much of Syria for a second day. Fighting killed another 106 people across the country, according to an opposition group that counts casualties. Government forces and rebels battled in towns near the airport, which was closed on Thursday, the opposition group said. The possibility it could fall to rebel forces would be a significant development in the nearly two-year conflict. Rebel control of the airport ""would have a psychological effect"" on the government and people who live in Damascus who support the regime, said retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a former top military aide to former President George W. Bush. ""The civilians in Damascus will feel cut off from the outside world,"" Kimmitt said. State run media blamed the violence on ""terrorists."" Al-Assad loyalists and members of the Alawite minority (the al-Assads are Alawites) might flee to neighboring countries, while others could take up arms to defend al-Assad. As the rebels worked on gaining ground at the airport, they told CNN on Friday that they had pushed al-Assad's forces from the al-Omar oilfield in the city of Deir Ezzor, which is in an oil-rich region. They have been battling Syrian forces there for weeks. Al-Assad's forces remain in control of five major oilfields in Deir Ezzor, the opposition said. Those killed on Friday including six people in Aleppo and two in Damascus, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. CNN could not confirm government or opposition claims about violence and casualties as Syria has severely restricted access for journalists. A Syrian government information minister said that ""terrorists"" -- which is how the Assad government refers to rebels -- cut the Internet service. But Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare, a leading Web security firm, said the government is almost certainly responsible because of the outage pattern. Rebels have routinely used the Web to transmit images of the civil war. The uprising in Syria began in March 2011, largely inspired by Arab Spring protests that toppled hardline regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. Al-Assad's government responded by arresting, beating and shooting protesters, experts and witnesses said. The crackdown ignited a vicious armed conflict that has killed more than 40,000 civilians, according to the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. More than 380,000 Syrians have fled the violence, the United Nations reports, to become refugees in neighboring countries such as Turkey and Lebanon. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Road to the airport opens, but the Internet is still down, the opposition says .

"(CNN) -- Police say 40 ball pythons were confiscated from a single motel room on Thursday in Brantford, Ontario, about 65 miles southwest of Toronto. The room was occupied at the time by four people -- two of them children. The incident comes just weeks after two young brothers were strangled to death by a large, exotic python as they slept at a friend's house in Campbellton, New Brunswick. The Children's Aid Society of Brant is investigating the welfare of those children, Brantford Police Sgt. Cheney Venn told CNN. Though it's against the law to own a python in Brantford, no arrests have been made and no charges have been filed; nor have any names have been released by authorities. The pythons ranged in size from 1 foot to 4Â½ feet, and they were stored in several plastic storage bins. ""It appeared as though they were being kept for breeding purposes"" Sgt. Venn told CNN. ""(They) were not being suitably cared for and were in distress."" They were seized from the Bell City Motel by the county's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, according to executive director Robin Kuchma. She said in an e-mail they have since been sent ""off to a rescue where those who are experienced can care for them."" An exasperated employee who answered the phone at the Bell City Motel pleaded to be left alone before hanging up when reached by CNN Friday night. Venn says the couple and two children checked in a few days ago, after being evicted from their prior residence. He did not know whether the snakes played a role in their eviction. Venn said the Bell City Motel has a ""no pets"" policy.","The snakes were in a single motel room in Brantford, Ontario .

"(TIME.com) -- Chlorine is supposed to take care of most of the microbes floating around in pools, but human waste, it seems, is stubbornly resistant to being sanitized. That's the conclusion of a group of researchers from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), who collected water samples from 161 filters in public and private swimming pools, as well as water parks in Atlanta last summer. What they found trapped in those filters was enough to make swimmers think twice before logging their laps. More than half of the samples were contaminated with E. coli, which the investigators say comes from one primary source -- swimmers pooping in the pool. The study, published in the latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, specifically looked at pools in Atlanta, but the researchers say such contamination is likely a widespread problem in U.S. pools, thanks to swimmers not washing themselves off before taking a dip. According to the scientists, each of us carries about 0.14 grams of fecal material into the pool -- and that doesn't include accidents or cases of diarrhea. Among municipal pools, the genetic testing for pathogens detected E. coli in 70% of the filters, while 66% of the water parks contained the bacteria and 49% of pools in private clubs showed evidence of the contamination. ""These findings indicate the need for swimmers to help prevent introduction of pathogens, e.g., taking a pre-swim shower and not swimming when ill with diarrhea, (for) aquatics staff to maintain disinfectant level and pH according to public health standards to inactivate pathogens, and state and local environmental health specialists to enforce such standards,"" the authors write in their report. When a pool is properly chlorinated, however, bacteria like E. coli should be killed off, since proper pH levels typically take care of the issue. According to the CDC, it takes less than a minute for E. coli to be inactivated if chlorine levels are adequate, about 16 minutes to control Hepatitis A virus, about 45 minutes to kill off the Giardia parasite and over 10 days for a Crypto parasite. But just one diarrhea accident can cause an infection for anyone who gets a mouth full of pool water. Fortunately, the testing did not reveal strains of E. coli 0157, a particularly virulent form of the bacteria that was responsible for several outbreaks, and deaths, from serious foodborne illnesses. According to NPR, because the researchers only analyzed the samples for genetic signatures of different pathogens, they couldn't determine whether the bugs were alive, and potentially reproducing in the water, but there were no pool-related diseases reported in Atlanta during the summer the samples were gathered. Thomas Lachocki, the CEO of the National Swimming Pool Foundation, says that in order to be properly chlorinated, pools should contain 1-4 parts per million of chlorine and pH levels should be within 7.2--7.8. ""You can go to any mass market store and go into the pool chemical aisle and buy test stripes. All of these have chlorine and pH tests. In five seconds, you can do a quick analysis yourself and have an idea of what the various levels are,"" he says. But if you don't have the time to do your own testing, look for clear water. ""You should always be able to see the bottom of the pool clearly. Usually if the water is cloudy, something with the filter or chemicals isn't right,"" says Lachocki. ""Clear water doesn't mean everything is alright, but cloudy water is an absolute positive sign that something is not right."" Here are some additional recommendations from the CDC for ensuring a bug-free dip: . -- Don't swim when you have diarrhea. -- Shower with soap before you start swimming. -- Take a shower to rinse off before you get back into the water. -- Take bathroom breaks every 60 minutes. -- Wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers. -- Try not to swallow the pool water. If you have young children: . -- Take children on bathroom breaks every half-hour to hour or check diapers frequently. -- Change diapers in the bathroom or diaper-changing area and not at poolside where pathogens can rinse into the water. There may be no way to completely sanitize a pool, but the latest analysis of what could be lurking in the water should motivate lifeguards and pool managers to be more vigilant about testing those waters more frequently. People should outnumber the pathogens in any pool. This article was initially published on TIME.com. Don't drink the pool water! It contains a surprising amount of human waste . &copy 2012 TIME, Inc.

"(CNN) -- ""I measure every grief I meet . ""With analytic eyes; . ""I wonder if it weighs like mine, . ""Or has an easier size."" -- Emily Dickinson . To sing Neil Diamond's ""Sweet Caroline"" is not a sickeningly sweet way to show how you feel today about Boston. It's a charming way, if you ask me. Because, as wise ol' Neil puts it in another oldie, ""Me and you are subject to the blues now and then."" So, come on, let's hear it. Sing a song sung blue. It's what red-eyed Red Sox fans did, loud and strong, on Saturday when their team came back to its own diamond for the first time since the Boston Marathon bombings -- and Diamond himself showed up to lead the crowd. I know it's what Yankee fans did a few nights ago in New York, where a singalong of ""Sweet Caroline"" in that team's stadium would normally be about as welcome as a German anthem in ""Casablanca"" in Humphrey Bogart's bar. Indian fans, Cub fans, Marlin fans and others have sung it at recent games as well in Boston's honor. Which is totally cool of you all. It's what a Cardinal or Oriole or Jay or Ray or A fan could do at a home game to show solidarity, not unlike nine of Jackie Robinson's disciples all running onto a field wearing 42. It wouldn't kill a Phillie fanatic, a Brave soul or a Met soprano to belt out a stanza's worth of ""Sweet Caroline"" for one inning, even if not everybody is in agreement with the line that goes, ""Good times never seemed so good."" It can happen anywhere . Neil Diamond tweeted a thank you to New Yorkers -- ""you scored a home run in my heart"" -- for warbling his ditty in their city, inasmuch as his long-ago ode to Caroline Kennedy has over the years evolved into the Red Sox's good-luck tune. OK, so it's not the hippest verse on Earth. OK, so the judges from ""The Voice"" would probably cover their ears. OK, so this isn't a song up for a Grammy so much as it is a song that's sung around the house by your Grammy. An innocuous song isn't a life-altering tribute, any more than ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree"" years ago lessened the pain of loved ones heartsick about missing daughters and sons. But sometimes, hey, it really is the thought that counts. Boston, we are with you. For those of us not fans of your teams (or New York's), it wouldn't normally break our hearts if we woke up to find out that Major League Baseball wants to move you 3,000 miles to be the Boston Red Sox of Anaheim. Bleacher Report: Rene Rancourt's national anthem at Bruins game helps Boston heal . Today, though, I and others like me would gladly link arms with Ben Affleck and Stephen King and James Taylor and don a cap with a big ""B"" on it and stand by your side, crooning about ""Caroline"" as if if it were the greatest musical composition since Mozart's. I cannot conceive of what the sorrow must be like from Monday's horror, any more than I could a while ago when innocent Connecticut children were killed. Dickinson, the gentle ""Belle of Amherst,"" summed it up as well as anybody could in her poem, ""I Measure Every Grief I Meet."" ""I wonder if it hurts to live, . ""And if they have to try, . ""And whether, could they choose between, . ""They would not rather die."" Events such as these cause many of us to re-evaluate what matters most. Getting to a finish line is of no meaning if no one is there to care. Winning a race is irrelevant if no one is waiting at its end to give you an embrace. Bleacher Report: Red Sox release uniforms honoring victims of Boston Marathon tragedy . I covered a couple of Boston Marathons, back when it was several times more famous than any other marathon in America, or maybe the whole world. I can't recall if back then New York even had a marathon. To see that city on Patriots' Day was quite a sight. It wasn't a Fenway crowd or a Garden crowd. It was the whole commonwealth of Massachusetts, or felt that way, lined along the sidewalks and streets. What a civic pleasure. Alas, life has a way of interfering with our enjoyment of it. Terrorism was so rampant in Europe once when I went to Paris to attend a Tour de France, the sign identifying the bureau my newspaper shared with NBC on the Champs Elysees had to be masked with tape, I suppose so no mad bomber could easily find it. That same year, 1986, a bomb was placed at the Eiffel Tower but failed to explode. A couple months after the bike race, bombs went off in a Paris town hall, then a casino, then at a police headquarters. Many died. Many more were maimed. Roughly 10 years later, I was in Atlanta, winding down from a long day, when we heard a distant boom. Blocks away, a pipe bomb had gone off in Centennial Olympic Park, right in the middle of the 1996 Olympic Games. One dead, 111 injured. (A cameraman also died of a heart attack.) A lot of us who didn't care at all about Atlanta turned into Atlanta fans that day. We brace for the worst, but it shocks us anyway.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic could meet in the Davis Cup next year after Switzerland was paired with Serbia in the first round of the world group. Federer didn't play in the team event this year, although he might be tempted to return to action given the glamorous nature of the series. The Davis Cup and an Olympic gold in singles are the two items missing from the Swiss' glittering resume. Federer doesn't usually compete in the first round, however, skipping proceedings from 2005-2011. His teammate, Stanislas Wawrinka, would like to have him back for the road tie. Wawrinka, coming off a tiring U.S. Open where he lost to Djokovic in the semifinals, led Switzerland to a comfortable victory against Ecuador last weekend that kept the home side in the elite group. When asked if he would have wanted Federer to text him and say that he would take his spot against Ecuador, Davis Cup regular Wawrinka was quoted as saying by the Davis Cup website: ""No, my dream is that Roger would text me and say, 'Go and win this tie and next year I'll be a part of the team.'""

The breakup of the multiethnic communist Yugoslavia in the early 1990s led to the bloodiest conflict on the European continent since World War II. Karadzic's Bosnian Serb forces have been accused of ruthlessly working to oust Muslims and Croatians from regions claimed to be Serbian, actions that have come to be known as ""ethnic cleansing."" But Karadzic, 67, tried to make a case for himself as a humanitarian leader without designs to commit mass crimes. How the world took a step closer to ending impunity . ""I never allowed for the possibility of even the smallest individual crimes, and especially not crimes on a mass scale, nor the possibility that any of the communities would be permanently removed from the Serb territories,"" he said. ""I should have been rewarded for all the good things that I've done,"" he said. ""I did everything within human power to avoid the war and to reduce the human suffering of all civilians."" Karadzic has been charged in connection with three high-profile actions in the war. One is the notorious massacre of about 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That event has come to symbolize the brutality of the Balkan wars. Another is the ""permanent removal of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats from the territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina claimed as Bosnian Serb territory."" He is charged for a role in overseeing the actions known as the ""siege of Sarajevo,"" sniping and shelling by Bosnian Serb forces in the Bosnian capital that killed and wounded thousands of civilians. But Karadzic defended his actions and said he has ""nothing against Muslims and Croats."" A trained psychiatrist, he called himself a ""mild man"" and a ""tolerant man, with a great capacity for understanding others."" That brought a shout of ""liar"" from The Hague gallery. Karadzic was indicted in 1995. After hiding in plain sight for more than a decade, he was captured in Belgrade, Serbia, in 2008. He had adopted an elaborate disguise that included long hair and a full beard, and was practicing alternative medicine in the Serbian capital. The trial began in 2009, but Karadzic failed to attend the proceedings several times because he said he didn't have enough time to prepare. Genocide count dropped in Karadzic trial . The court allowed him to represent himself, with the provision that a standby lawyer will take over if he refuses to attend court. Karadzic made opening statements in March 2010. The prosecution began presenting evidence in April 2010 and rested its case in May. The ICTY said the trial is expected to finish in 2014. Karadzic, Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic and Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic have been the highest-profile suspects on trial at the ICTY. Mladic was captured last year and is also on trial for charges such as genocide. Both Karadzic and Mladic would face life in prison if convicted. The court cannot impose the death penalty. Milosevic died while on trial at The Hague. During the 1990s and the early 2000s, conflict raged in Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Kosovo, a Serbian territory dominated by ethnic Albanians. An estimated 140,000 people died in the wars, ICTY head of communications, Nerma Jelacic, told CNN. Around 100,000 deaths occurred in Bosnia, she said. Yugoslavia's six republics -- Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia -- are now independent countries. Kosovo broke away from Serbia and declared its independence several years ago. The tribunal has indicted 161 people for international law violations in the former Yugoslavia. The tribunal said ""the most significant number"" of its cases dealt with alleged crimes by Serbians or Bosnian Serbs. But there have been convictions for crimes against Serbs by others, including Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Kosovo Albanians. The trial of the last Yugoslavian war crimes suspect at large also started Tuesday, with proceedings beginning against Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. Appeals in some of the cases are expected to last until 2016. CNN's Dominique Van Heerden contributed to this report.","Radovan Karadzic is accused in the Srebrenica massacre, in which about 8,000 Muslims died .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- At least 14 people died and 15 others were wounded in an attack on the U.N. headquarters in the Somali capital of Mogadishu on Wednesday. Seven militants, four U.N. employees and three female civilians were killed, said Abdikarim Hussein Guled, the country's interior and national security minister. The other victims were rushed to a hospital. Al-Shabaab, the militant group linked to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility, the group said on Twitter. Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon deplored the ""senseless and despicable"" assault against an agency that has been a friend and partner. ""I and all Somalis are appalled that they should be the target and victims of such barbaric violence,"" Shirdon said. It was the latest in a series of attacks in the city, the heart of an unstable nation beset with civil strife, with government and African Union forces battling Islamic militants for years in an effort to bring stability to the land. Last month, a suicide bomber targeted a Qatari delegation, killing at least eight people. Al-Shabaab also claimed responsibility for that strike. In April, militants forced their way into a court building in Mogadishu and killed 29 people, including members of Al-Shabaab, sources said. Police Officer Hussein Ahmed said that in Wednesday's violence, one attacker blew himself up at the entrance of the U.N. compound, which is near the city's airport. Others wearing suicide vests entered the U.N. compound. He said Somali and AU forces surrounded the building and fought with the armed assailants. The attack devastated the area. Mangled buses and cars sat in disfigured heaps, the windows of nearby apartments shattered, the ground littered with blood and body parts. A large brown plume of smoke was visible in the air as ambulances rushed to the scene and carried away the wounded. The compound has now been secured and is in the hands of AU troops, the official Twitter account of the African Union Mission to Somalia said. Shirdon also assured city residents that the government remains in control of security and underscored the swift action by the forces against the attackers. ""All our thoughts and prayers are with our U.N. colleagues today,"" Shirdon said. ""Al-Shabaab will not derail the peace process. They will not stop our recovery. Violence will not win.""","Civilians, militants and U.N. employees were killed; 15 people were wounded .

"(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told his troops to be vigilant during upcoming training exercises between South Korea and the United States, saying they should be ready to lead a ""sacred war,"" state media reported Saturday. Kim's comments came during a visit on Mu Island with troops who participated in the 2010 shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, an attack that North Korea at the time said South Korea provoked by holding war games off their shared coast. ""He ordered the service persons of the detachment to be vigilant against every move of the enemy and not to miss their gold chance to deal at once deadly counter blows at the enemy, if even a single shell is dropped on the waters or in the area where the sovereignty of (North Korea) is exercised,"" the state-run KCNA news agency reported. The warning followed an announcement by the United States and South Korea that their joint ""Ulchi Freedom Guardian"" training exercises would begin Monday and conclude by August 31. North Korea was informed of the dates of the exercises by the U.N. armistice commission. In June: North Korea slams use of its flag in U.S.-South Korea military drills . The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which was established by the Korean Armistice Agreement that brought about an end to the Korean War, will supervise the exercise, South Korea and the United States military said in a joint statement. The commission includes representatives from Switzerland, China and other nations selected by the United Nations. Washington and Pyongyang have no diplomatic relations. North and South Korea have no formal ties and remain technically in a state of war since a 1953 truce that ended the Korean War. During the visit with troops, Kim observed Yeonpyeong Island ""clearly visible from the post,"" KCNA reported. The Yeonpyeong attack in November 2010 was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea by North Korea since 1953, when an armistice ending the fighting. Two civilians and two South Korean marines died in the attack, which South Korea's government at the time called a ""definite military provocation"" by North Korea.

The sparsely populated Yeonpyeong is located just south of the Northern Limit Line, the line drawn in 1953 by the United Nations at the end of the Korean War. The United Nations drew the line three nautical miles from the North Korean coast and put five islands close to the coast under South Korean control. That was supposed to be a temporary arrangement. But in the absence of a full peace agreement, the Northern Limit Line remains in place.

"(CNN) -- A number of Transportation Security Administrator employees who faced dismissal for not following screening procedures ended up with suspensions instead, the agency said. In October, TSA announced that 44 employees were facing punishments ranging from termination to suspension after they were caught on surveillance cameras not following procedures. Twenty-five of those employees were in the process of being fired. This week, the agency completed the reviews of those cases, except for one, and only four workers have been fired. ""The decision to take disciplinary actions as a result of a thorough investigation reaffirms our strong commitment to hold all of our employees to the highest standards of conduct and accountability -- regardless of their rank in the agency,"" TSA said in a statement. ""It also goes to TSA's commitment to its due process procedures and demonstrates the agency's dedication to treating employees in a fair and just manner."" TSA: Eight Newark officers fired for violating procedures . Several of the employees had learned of their fates in the months since October, but the majority of decisions were made this week. In all, four employees were fired, one resigned, 32 were suspended to varying degrees, six were cleared of wrongdoing, and one case remains outstanding, the agency told CNN. That means that 17 employees who were originally going to be fired were instead suspended ""because it was determined that they did not intentionally violate procedures associated with checked baggage screening,"" TSA said. The 44 employees all worked in a checked-baggage screening room in Terminal B of Newark's Liberty International Airport. In November and December of 2011, they were caught on surveillance cameras not following proper screening protocols, an agency internal investigation revealed. TSA seeks to fire or suspend largest group of agents ever . After passengers check their bags, TSA screeners are supposed to search the luggage with electronic scanners and open some bags by hand. In this case, the employees allegedly didn't follow procedures on about 250 bags during the two months, the agency said. All bags did receive some screening, however. In June 2012, the same investigation prompted the agency to fire eight checked-baggage screeners at Newark for violating TSA procedures, including some of them for sleeping on the job. That same month, 43 TSA workers in Fort Myers, Florida, were disciplined for not performing additional screening on random passengers and carry-on bags. TSA workers disciplined for not rescreening bags . At Boston's Logan Airport, 20 checked-baggage screeners were punished in August 2011 for reading newspapers or talking on the phone when they were supposed to be screening bags, or for not reporting the misconduct, a spokesperson told CNN at the time. Also in 2011, 36 checked-bag screeners in Hawaii were fired after they were caught on a security camera in 2010 ignoring procedures, including putting bag inspection notices in bags without actually inspecting them, an inspector general's report said. CNN's Jordana Ossad and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","44 TSA employees were slated for discipline last year .

"(CNN) -- At least 35 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in shootings and explosions across the country on Tuesday, officials with Iraq's interior ministry told CNN. Officials said 29 people were killed and 107 wounded in 11 car bomb explosions in nine different parts of Baghdad. Most of killed and wounded were civilians, officials said. In Falluja, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Baghdad, five people were killed and 12 others were wounded when gunmen attacked al-Tahadi police station in southern Falluja. In northern Mosul, about 400 kilometers (249 miles) north of Baghdad, a bomb exploded in the convoy of army Gen. Mohammed Khamas, killing him instantly. Khamas was the deputy head of army intelligence department in Mosul. Iraq has seen a sharp increase in friction between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Sunnis have felt politically marginalized under Shiite President Nuri al-Maliki, whose government fears it is being targeted by Sunni Islamists involved in fighting in neighboring Syria. More than 800 Iraqis were killed and 2,030 wounded in violence and acts of terrorism in August, the United Nations said.","11 car bomb explosions kill 29, injure 107 in Baghdad, officials tell CNN .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A taxi driver in Thailand has been charged with murder after allegedly stabbing an American with a machete during a fare dispute. Police said they arrested Cherdchai Utamacha in Bangkok over the weekend, hours after closed-circuit television footage showed him attacking Troy Lee Pilkington, an American citizen who had lived in Thailand for three years. Authorities allege that Cherdchai told police he was infuriated after Pilkington accused him of cheating and threw coffee in his face as the two argued over how much the American owed for a taxi ride. The fare was 51 Thai baht (about $1.60), according to police, who interrogated the driver. Security camera footage helped police track down the suspect quickly, Col. Thawatkiet Jindakuansanong said. ""When we traced the man to a house in Bangkok, we still saw blood stains on his shirt (and) shoes,"" he said. Police said the driver smacked and stabbed Pilkington multiple times. They have not released a cause of death pending autopsy results.","Police arrest driver in Bangkok after viewing security footage .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court wavered like the tides Wednesday in an unusual dispute over whether owners of private waterfront property were unfairly deprived title to land that touches the ocean. It was unclear from the one-hour public session which way the justices might go on the case. At issue is whether courts, by reinterpreting state law, can deprive deed holders of their traditional shoreline rights, amounting to a ""judicial taking"" of property. Florida officials said that when the state deposited tons of new sand on eroding shorelines, the replenished land became government property, essentially creating a strip of public beach between the landowners' property and the ocean. Several residents along the nearly seven-mile stretch of reclaimed land near the resort town of Destin protested, saying their oceanfront property line extends to the water, a practice they say has been endorsed in prior state courts for more than a century. The lawyer for the homeowners called it a ""land grab"" by the local government. Kent Safriet told the high court that what had been a beach stretching 200 feet to the water has become a 75-foot stretch of public beach, between the property line and the water's edge. ""People pay a lot more for beachfront homes for that reason,"" instead of property with beach views, said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""You didn't lose one inch,"" Justice Stephen Breyer said about the homeowners who sued. ""All you lost was the right to touch the water. But the [state] court here says you in effect have that right because you can walk right over it and get to the water."" The state says nearly 200 miles -- about a quarter of the state's 825 miles of beaches -- have been restored in an area prone to hurricanes and heavy storms churned up in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. And officials say that since such ""emergent"" land does not take away property, it is not considered eminent domain, in which the government would have to compensate the private owner. Property rights along the water -- known as littoral ownership -- have long been a tricky matter. In most coastal states, beachfront property is split between the government and private owners. The dividing line has traditionally been the mean high water line (MHWL), a flexible border that depends on shifting sands and tides. The state usually owns the property seaward of the MHWL. The homeowners who sued -- who had just six of the 448 parcels included in that replenishment project -- created a group called Stop the Beach Renourishment Inc. Local environmental groups, and some other homeowners in the neighborhood, say the plaintiffs appear to be ""looking a gift horse in the mouth""-- benefiting from taxpayer-paid restoration but claiming ownership of the artificial beach. The Florida Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state, prompting the high court appeal. The area along Florida's Panhandle is known for its dramatic crystal white sands. Destin, a popular beach town, calls itself the ""world's luckiest fishing village."" Safriet told the court the difference between beachfront and ""beach view"" -- from an aesthetic and financial point of view -- is tremendous, when property values are considered. ""It was a wholesale transfer of rights as well as the deed,"" he said. But Breyer said state law was generous to the private owners, saying no permanent structures, or anything that would spoil the right of peaceful enjoyment of their property, could be placed on the reclaimed land. ""Now, if they put a noisy hot dog stand that keeps you up at night, doesn't that violate the statute?"" he asked. Justice Sonia Sotomayor went further, saying that a boat or even a floating hot dog stand could sit just offshore, in a foot of water, and the private owners might not be able to do anything about it since it remained public property. ""No different than what exists today, before the legislation, which is if the hot dog vendor wanted to sit in a foot of water, it could have,"" she said. ""So none of your actual use rights, pleasure rights or anything else has been changed"" by the reclamation project, she said. Justice Samuel Alito, leading the strongest voice among his conservative colleagues, suggested the state court made ""a fundamental change in Florida property law to extend these concepts of [natural sediment erosion or addition] to things that are done by the state. ""Does that mean the state could come in and knock down the house and say this is an artificial avulsion?"" he asked, referring to environmental damage done by a severe storm. He then took the hot dog hypothetical further. ""Suppose a city decided it wanted to attract more students who were going to the beach in Florida for spring break, and so therefore it decided it was going to create a huge beach in front of privately owned homes. Under the decision of the Florida Supreme Court, I don't see anything that would stop the city from doing that,"" he theorized, saying such an event could even be televised. ""As a practical matter, doesn't that have a real effect on the value of the property?"" The case has not yet risen to the level of public outcry from the high court's separate 2005 ruling, which said the government had the power under eminent domain to take private homes and give them to private developers, in the name of improving downtrodden neighborhoods. That provoked widespread criticism and led several states to reform their eminent domain laws. Property rights advocates, supported by a range of conservative and libertarian legal groups, back the homeowners in the beach dispute. Environmentalists, along with a majority of states and the Obama administration, back Florida. Justice John Paul Stevens was not on the bench for the morning arguments. No explanation has yet been given for his absence, but the 89-year-old justice may have recused himself because he owns beachfront property in the state. The justices will decide whether courts, apart from legislatures or the executive branch, have the power through a ruling to create a private property ""taking,"" something historically prohibited by the Constitution. It is an issue they have been pondering, but never really tackling, for decades. Until now. The case is Stop the Beach Renourishment v. Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection (08-1151). A ruling is expected by spring 2010.","The U.S. Supreme Court held a one-hour public session Wednesday on shoreline rights .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The Olympics can be a cruel game with winners and losers. And in Tokyo, there is Kohei Jinno, 80 and his wife Yasuko, 79. The elderly couple are experiencing a cruel sense of déjà vu, certainly not in keeping with the Olympic spirit. ""Why do we need another Olympic here?"" Yasuko Jinno asked, referring to the recent decision to award the Summer Games to the city in 2020. ""There are still many people there up in Tohoku (the northern Japan area hit by the 2011 earthquake). The money should be spent there, not here."" Their lack of enthusiasm stems from bitter memories of their first eviction. Kohei Jinno's family home was razed to make way for the National Olympic Stadium ahead of the '64 Games. They were one of the last to leave the area after fighting in court. He also lost his tobacco shop to the construction project and had to start anew. The family eventually agreed to move after the city government found a new apartment for them. And nearly 50 years later, the aging couple is being asked to do it all over again. Plans to expand the existing National Olympic Stadium means accommodating 80,000 spectators under an all-weather roof, which is the standard for hosting the opening ceremony. And that also means the couple's current apartment, which is owned by the Tokyo government, is in an area at the heart of that project. Jinno's small tobacco shop at the ground level of the Kasumigaoka Apartments, is also to be demolished for the expanded stadium. ""There was only one explanation session held by the government so far, and that's it,"" said Yasuko Jinno. A Tokyo housing official said that the government has been talking to the residents of Kasumigaoka Apartment since last summer when the project for the new stadium was revealed and that it has shown options to the residents to move. The couple will be close to 90 by the time the Olympic Games returns to their neighborhood. Kohei Jinno says they have no energy left to fight another drawn-out court case. He cannot open a new tobacco shop, because such businesses are heavily regulated. ""I don't want to see another Olympics,"" he said. ""The money should be spent on the people who are still suffering after the quake and tsunami."" Soon, they'll have to leave their apartment, the open balcony where they've gotten to know their neighbors for the last five decades. Kohei Jinno will no longer take his daily stroll to his tobacco and public phone shop. Earlier this month, the International Olympic Committee pipped Tokyo over Madrid and Istanbul for the right to host the world's biggest sporting event in seven years. The city raised significant capital and was considered the safe choice, despite the ongoing concerns over high radiation levels at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant. Tokyo's government had amassed a $4.9 billion Olympic fund to prepare for the Games, according to aroundtherings.com, which covers the business and politics of the Olympics. The Tokyo bid has been touted as a way of breathing new life into the world's third-largest economy, which has been dogged by deflation, stagnation and the Fukushima leaks in recent years. When Tokyo won the Olympic bid, crowds at the capital welcomed the news, cheering and holding signs reading ""We're waiting for the world to come to Tokyo in 2020."" Instead, Yasuko Jinno felt shock. ""I did not think Tokyo would win and the Olympics would come here again."" CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Japan and Madison Park wrote from Hong Kong.","Kohei Jinno, 80, stands to be evicted and lose his Tokyo shop -- again .

"(CNN) -- Google says it will spend $5 million on an effort to wipe pictures of child sexual abuse from the Web and another $2 million to research more effective ways to find, report and eradicate the images. ""The Internet has been a tremendous force for good -- increasing access to information, improving people's ability to communicate and driving economic growth,"" Jacqueline Fuller, the director of Google Giving, said in a blog post. ""But like the physical world, there are dark corners on the web where criminal behavior exists."" Part of the $5 million will go to established child-protection groups that have been partnering with Google to fight the problem. They include the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Internet Watch Foundation. The Web giant also is creating the Child Protection Technology Fund to develop more efficient ways to fight child porn. Recently, Google has begun using ""fingerprinting"" of child sex-abuse images, Fuller said. It will help law enforcement, Web companies and advocates find and remove the images, as well as prosecute the people who posted them, Google says. ""We're in the business of making information widely available, but there's certain 'information' that should never be created or found,"" Fuller wrote. ""We can do a lot to ensure it's not available online -- and that when people try to share this disgusting content they are caught and prosecuted."" Since 2008, Google has been using technology to tag images, helping the company find them anywhere else they may appear on the Web. Among other things, Google can make sure images or Web pages do not appear in search results. In 2006, the company joined Microsoft, Aol, Time, Time Warner (CNN's parent company) and others in a Technology Coalition, targeting child abuse on the Web, and has donated hardware and software to groups around the world fighting child sex abuse. The company, which jealously protects details on how its search algorithms and other processes work, did not immediately respond to a message seeking more details about how its new initiative will work and what additional efforts may be on the way. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the group's tip line received 17.3 million images and videos of suspected child abuse in 2011. That was four times what the group received in 2007.","Google spending a total of $7 million to ramp up fight against child porn .

"Editor's note: This review may contain spoilers.

Yet it's a very different sort of zombie feast (far more than, say, ""The Walking Dead""). It's vast and sprawling and spectacular; it's the first truly globalized orgy of the undead. Box office preview: 'Monsters University' eyes a monstrous debut; 'World War Z' hopes to go viral . The director, Marc Forster, is a filmmaker whose work I've never particularly liked (he made the genteel ""Finding Neverland,"" the overblown ""Monster's Ball,"" and the Bond dud ""Quantum of Solace""). Here, though, working from the 2006 Max Brooks novel ""World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,"" he shows a new audacity and flair. ""World War Z"" is epically scaled, but it's not a messy, noisy, CGI-bogus, throw-everything-at-the-audience sort of blockbuster. It's thrillingly controlled, and it builds in impact. The film opens with music that's meant to remind you of Tubular Bells, the chilling theme music from ""The Exorcist,"" and that's followed by a collage of actual TV news snippets cleverly edited together to suggest a world already tilting toward the abyss. In Philadelphia, where Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters (Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove) are driving from their suburban home toward the center of town, we're plunged into the first disquieting evidence of the zombie virus, the warning signs of breakdown: giant traffic jams, a street-corner explosion, cops whizzing by, and, finally, a zombie — or is it just an angry, desperate civilian? — crashing up against the windshield. Brad Pitt: From 'Dallas' to 'World War Z' When people in ""World War Z"" get bitten and turn into rabid undead freaks, the conversion happens frighteningly quickly, without a lot of fuss. They lie on the ground for a moment, then get all twitchy, as if they're receiving an electroshock treatment, and their eyes bulge up to the heavens in rage. Gerry, a former U.N. investigator, spends most of the film traveling around the world, searching for the origins of the virus (and a possible cure), yet metaphorically speaking, we're already cued to see what has brought about this onslaught. ""World War Z"" is rooted in the current mood of economic panic and terrorist fear and impending chaos. It presents the zombie army as a culmination of what it's going to look like if and when the bottom falls out of our society. An early scene set in South Korea, where Gerry looks over the dusty remains of Patient Zero, has a hushed creepiness, but ""World War Z"" finds its own unique atmosphere of large-scale disorder after Gerry arrives in Jerusalem, where the Israelis have erected a wall around the city to keep the zombies out. The wall doesn't work. As the zombies — and there are thousands of them — shimmy up the side of it, in a squirmy hill of bodies that spill over the top of the edifice, the action hits a raw nerve of peril, a feeling that nothing can keep them out. 'Bad Teacher 2' in development with Columbia Pictures . ""World War Z"" lifts some of its vérité-apocalypse mood, as well as the terrifying speed with which the zombies move, from Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" (2003). Yet this is a much more varied and surprising movie, built around a soberly commanding performance by Pitt as the family man who must leave his wife and daughters on a U.N. command ship as he hops from one trouble spot to the next. As Gerry, Pitt is cool, fearless, tense, compassionate and brutally tough (at one point, he chops off the hand of a soldier to save her from going zombie). He's feral grace under pressure. The stakes for survival keep getting raised. A zombie attack aboard an airplane has a nightmarish this-is-really happening intensity (though it does give the film a semi-preposterous moment, when the plane starts to go down). Then Pitt arrives at a World Health Organization facility, where he must brave sterile white corridors dotted with zombies to get inside a lab vault. The film lets us linger for a bit on what the zombies look like — one's a gnashing Miles Davis clone, one clicks its teeth in close-up like a demented gopher — and the story's blend of terror and ingenuity attains an intoxicating, jittery finesse. ""World War Z"" turns the prospect of the end of our world into something tumultuous and horrifying and, at the same time, exciting. It's scary good fun. Grade: A- . See the original story at EW.com.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In the 6-1/2 years Htein Lin spent in Myanmar prisons between 1998 and 2004, he produced an estimated 250 paintings. He credits prison guards with helping to save most of his work. Htein Lin stands beside ""Red September Memory,"" which alludes to last year's Myanmar protests and Buddhism. They became his audience during his time in prison. In what Htein Lin called ""the smuggling painting project,"" he said eight to 10 guards provided him with house paint, acrylics, or colored powder from the prison factory where inmates made items. They were too scared to provide a brush, however; so, Htein Lin improvised by resorting to his fingers, hands, soap, sometimes his face. His canvases were his dinner plate and white cotton prison uniforms. It was while working on the cotton uniforms, the absorbency of which made controlling lines difficult, that Htein Lin discovered monoprinting as a useful technique. He would take his dinner plate, apply glue and color to its backside, use his finger as a brush, and then press the finished image against the cotton. Htein Lin would show the prison guards his paintings, explain their meaning and solicit their opinions: ""How do you feel?"" he'd ask. ""One year later, they appreciate my art,"" he said. The more paints they brought, the more he painted, and this was how he was able to prove he was an artist, not a politician, Htein Lin said. Eventually, the guards would want to share the secret with their friends, other guards. And this is how the ""network"" grew, Htein Lin said. These men took a big risk, facing demotion or possible imprisonment themselves, but their jobs were for a living, not for any particular belief, Htein Lin explained. Moreover, there was some relish for the secrecy of ""the game."" Today, most of those cloth paintings are housed in Amsterdam, Netherlands, at the International Institute of Social History, a repository for documents concerning the Myanmar opposition movements. In the past year, Htein Lin, now 41, has rendered those same images onto canvas, a dozen of which have been the focus of an exhibition at the Karin Weber Gallery in Hong Kong, China. His work next heads to exhibition at the Quest Gallery in Bath, England, from mid-May to early July. His ""The Cell"" series shows the use of plate bottoms, his hands and blocks -- the same tools he used while in prison. In ""The Cell 6,"" a single white line is used to trace the body of the prisoner as well as the walls of his prison, while smaller blocks of prisoners surround it. Further inscribed is a window with bars. The original cloth ""prison paintings"" are not for sale, however. Htein Lin was imprisoned for a month in Rangoon, two years at Mandalay Prison, and 4-1/2 years at Myaungmya Prison in the south. He was sentenced after being charged on the basis of a letter by a ""former comrade"" listing him as a potential recruit for Burmese opposition events in 1998, the 10-year anniversary of landmark democracy protests, according to Htein Lin. Although he was involved in the 1988 democracy protests as a young law student, his arrest occurred when he was not involved in politics, he said in a follow-up e-mail. ""I was making a living as an artist and an actor."" ""You are very nice. Why are you in prison?"" he recalled the prisoner guards as asking. They tended to be uneducated and had little knowledge of politics much less art, Htein Lin said. Some prison guards would ask, ""Could you write a very lovely poem to my girlfriend?"" or ""Can you do a design for my tattoo?"" Htein Lin said. ""So I draw for them."" Htein Lin, who performed in the streets in Yangon before his arrest, would also keep an eye out for prisoners about to be released; he wanted their prison uniforms. Many uniforms were used for portraits of other political prisoners, of Aung San Suu Kyi, and of Htein Lin's father, who died while the son was still in prison. Eventually, Htein Lin had to get rid of the paintings he was accumulating to avoid attracting attention from the prison superiors. The most he had in his cell were 10. As he befriended his guards, beseeching them to safeguard his paintings until his release, they would haul away the works in bags that carried prisoners' scraps for the pets at home, Htein Lin said. The cloth would be folded so as not to be dirtied. In one instance, however, a sergeant who'd agreed to smuggle paintings out of prison got very confused while looking at them and thought they included a map of a prison, Htein Lin said. ""He destroyed 20 of my paintings."" In 2005, a year after Htein Lin's release from Myaungmya, one guard came to Htein Lin's solo exhibition in Yangon featuring the cotton paintings he did during his prison years. The guard felt pride, Htein Lin said. The exhibition was called ""00235,"" the prisoner number Htein Lin was assigned by the International Committee of the Red Cross during its visits. Just weeks ago, Htein Lin painted ""Twenty Years On,"" which unites the history of the 1988 pro-democracy movement and the pro-democracy protests in August and September of last year. Rimming three borders of the paintings are feathers of the ""fighting peacock,"" the longtime symbol for Burmese students later adopted for the flag of the National League for Democracy, the party of Aung San Suu Kyi. The painting took him a couple days. Gallery owner Karin Weber said she offered him a solo exhibition right after hearing him give a talk last year. ""Clearly, his art is formed by his prison experience. But what I like about him is his realization that he needs to move away from this ... in order to develop as an artist,"" she said. Since moving to London, where he lives with his wife, former British Ambassador to Myanmar Vicky Bowman, he's painted a series of three ""How do you find London"" paintings in response to questions about his new city. The series ""How do you find Venice"" was painted for the Venice Biennial in which he participated last year. Other cities he's traveled to and roads he's traveled on since he left Myanmar have been rendered in paint, an activity he enjoys while his wife is driving, Htein Lin said.","Eight to 10 guards provided paints to Htein Lin, smuggled his paintings out of prison .

"(CNN) -- The mother of a missing Iowa girl thinks there is a chance she and her cousin were abducted and are not at the bottom of a lake where dogs have led searchers. ""Because we haven't found them anywhere in the surrounding area, I feel like maybe they were taken,"" Misty Cook-Morrissey, mother of 10-year-old Lyric Cook, told CNN on Wednesday. Lyric and 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins were last seen by their grandmother on Friday when they left on a bike ride. Missing girl's grandma: 'We will fight' The girls' bicycles and a purse were found near Meyers Lake hours after they were reported missing. Scent dogs following the girls' trail led searchers around the lake and stopped at the water's edge, Cook-Morrissey said. Authorities are draining the lake, but the operation is taking longer than originally expected. Officials expect the lake to be drained by Friday, said Chief Deputy Rick Abben of the Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office. Mom: Dogs searching for Iowa girls stopped at edge of lake . But Cook-Morrissey said the girls don't go to the lake. ""They don't swim there. My daughter is familiar with swimming in lakes, so I don't think she would be scared of this lake, but they don't come here and swim here,"" she said. Cook-Morrissey said she'd be ""more comfortable"" with the theory that the girls might have been abducted ""once they drain the lake and we find nothing there."" ""If you've taken our kids,"" she said on national TV, ""bring them back."" The FBI brought two dogs to the area to search Monday night, spokeswoman Sandy Breault said. Authorities did all they could with the dogs, and the animals won't be used again unless there is a new development, she said. Authorities said Tuesday that they didn't know whether the girls had been at the lake. ""We have their bicycles, and we have the purse, and that doesn't tell me that they've been there, just that those items are there,"" Abben said. The family has been questioned and polygraphed and had information taken from their cell phones, a process Cook-Morrissey said is hard but necessary. ""We know that it's a necessary measure they have to take to get as much information as they can and of course rule us out, so we did what we have to do,"" she said. Questioning has taken Cook-Morrissey and other family members away from the lake, which is hard, she said. ""Not that being out here might make a difference, but in your heart you want to be close to where they were last seen,"" she said. When Deutsch heard that two little girls were missing in his town, he said, the first thing he did was to make sure every city asset that was needed was made available to the county sheriff. Family 'bracing for the worst but hoping for the best' The next thing he did was take to the air, taking off in his twin-engine plane and flew over his town, looking for any sign of Lyric and Elizabeth. ""It just makes you sick,"" said Deutsch, who knows both families. In this town, neighbors know exactly how many people live there -- 4,751 -- and the small community has never suffered through anything like the worrying going on now, the mayor said. The search remains a missing persons case, authorities said. No evidence has been found to suggest this is a crime, Deutsch said, but it is a mystery that has the whole community looking for two of their own. ""We just want our girls home,"" Tammy Brousseau, an aunt to both girls, told CNN's ""AC360Ëš."" ""We're bracing for the worst but hoping for the best."" Calls are coming in to a tip line, Abben said, and each bit of information is being checked out. Police ask that anyone who may have seen the girls on Friday contact authorities. Lyric's grandmother Wylma Cook said she doesn't believe that the girls intended to go swimming. ""I don't think they would have even known the way to Meyers Lake,"" she told HLN's Nancy Grace on Tuesday. Heather Collins, Elizabeth's mother, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that if the girls were abducted, she would not pass judgment. ""We just want our children brought back,"" she said.","NEW: Officials expect the lake to be drained by Friday .

"(CNN) -- The city of Hebron on the West Bank has been a flashpoint of tension between Israelis and Palestinians for decades. But you'd never know it from a video posted on YouTube, showing armed Israeli soldiers walking into a Palestinian club there this week during a wedding party. They didn't go in shooting. And the young Palestinian men inside didn't throw a single stone or fist. The soldiers had heard the dance music streaming out into the streets and went inside to boogie with the crowd, CNN affiliate Channel 2 reported. The Palestinian revelers gave them a rousing welcome, heaving the soldiers up onto their shoulders, still in their flak jackets and helmets. They raved together to the happy, pulsating rhythms of electronica, one soldier atop a Palestinian's shoulders, bouncing his assault rifle to the beat. The soldiers walked out with smiles on their faces. But their bosses at the Israel Defense Forces weren't laughing. ""The IDF views this as a serious incident. The soldiers exposed themselves to unnecessary danger and were disciplined accordingly,"" it said in a statement. The soldiers were from the elite Givati Brigade, Channel 2 reported, tasked with fighting terrorism. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report .","Israeli soldiers walk into a club in flak jackets and helmets, carrying guns .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The sailboat crew chose an ocean-size ambition. They sought to land in Hawaii from Los Angeles with cruise ship-like speed, in less than five days. What they never expected to encounter was as unimaginable as a sea monster: a massive debris field floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Its origin? The catastrophic tsunami that obliterated coastal Japan two years ago. ""We experienced 'Fukushima's Revenge,'"" yacht owner John Sangmeister told CNN by satellite phone hours after his boat sustained significant damage after hitting two telephone poles and other objects. Fukushima is the Japanese city known for a nuclear meltdown in the 2011 tsunami. Despite the setback, Sangmeister and his Tritium Racing crew finished first in the 2,225-nautical-mile race (or 2,560 miles), but they were thwarted in setting a record, despite a highly orchestrated campaign to do so. The three-hulled sailboat, called a trimaran, was considered a likely contender to set a record because the 73-foot boat is considered among the 10 fastest yachts in the world and was the only one of those 10 competing in the race, according to the team's spokesman. Exhausted Friday from having received little sleep over five days, the boat's captain, Ryan Breymaier, told CNN he was largely blaming what's become a disturbing reality on the high seas: plumes of drifting junk. ""The fact of the modern world is that this stuff is out there,"" Breymaier said. ""I sailed around the world, and even then I remember commenting on how much trash and man-made debris was out there. ""We ran into six different pieces of tinder,"" Breymaier continued. ""Tree trunks, telephone poles and whatever else caused damage to the underwater surfaces of the boat that keep you going straight and fast."" These impacts hobbled the progress of the vessel Lending Club. The nine sailors aboard improvised repairs to a damaged daggerboard, a vertical board which slides through the central hull and submerges to keep the boat from slanting sideways. ""That immediately started to break apart. There was a big impact on the edge which caused it to split open. We had to stop the boat and figure out how to pull it up through the bearings. It took us a few hours to be able to sail again,"" Breymaier said. The crew used small, battery operated tools to fix the centerboard -- which looked like it suffered a very bad shark bite. ""It was just a mess to fix those problems,"" Breymaier said. ""We're talking about 12 hours that we lost to the finishing time because of these issues."" The racing crew set out Saturday to be the first competitors in an annual Transpacific Yacht Race to beat Bruno Peyron's 1997 record of traveling from Los Angeles to Honolulu on an 86-foot catamaran in five days, nine hours, 18 minutes, and 26 seconds. The Lending Club fell short by more than two hours, posting a time of five days, 11 hours, 52 minutes and 33 seconds. ""I bought this boat to be a challenger for breaking the record,"" Sangmeister said. ""We lengthened the floats, installed a new foil system and put together a new sail program."" For two years, he worked to build a team of world-class sailors -- using his connections in the sport during the recruiting. Shortly after dawn Friday, the crew was just beginning to take vacation time in Hawaii, after a night of post-race celebrations. They were undaunted by the menaces afloat in the world's biggest ocean. ""I can definitely see us coming back to try and beat it again -- it's a great race,"" Breymaier said.","Sailor John Sangmeister spends two years preparing for world record try to Hawaii .

"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old boy who allegedly fired a gun at another fleeing male on a New York street early Sunday morning was shot and killed by a uniformed police officer, the New York City Police Department said. The teen, identified as Shaaliver Douse, was pronounced dead at the scene, the department said in a news release. An investigation of the incident is ongoing, according to the release. Around 3 a.m. Sunday, two uniformed officers heard gunshots and proceeded east down a Bronx street, where ""a male was running westbound in the middle of the street, pursued by another male armed with 9 mm handgun,"" the release states. The area is designated an ""impact"" neighborhood, which means it has high crime rates and is flooded with police officers to reduce that crime. ""Ordered to 'drop the gun' by the uniformed officers who identified themselves as police, the male with the gun still in his hand did not comply,"" according to the news release. ""One of the officers discharged one round from his service weapon, striking the armed male in the lower left jaw,"" the release stated. A black 9 mm semiautomatic firearm was recovered at the scene. Florida deputies shoot man they mistook for car thief . The two officers, ages 26 and 27, were sent to a local hospital to be treated for tinnitus and trauma. They joined the NYPD in January, the release said. A man who lives in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred told CNN affiliate New York 1 that his son alerted him to the shooting early Sunday morning. Anthony Riverecio, who has lived in the Bronx for 68 years, told NY1, ""You can't walk this avenue. ... It's always constantly stabbing or shooting. They have been killing around here like crazy."" ""I respect them ... cops are doing a good job. There's too many guns out here,"" he said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly showed two surveillance videos of the incident at a news conference Sunday night. One of them shows Shaaliver holding a gun and chasing after another person, who has not been identified. Kelly said: ""It's very troubling, and obviously there are way too many guns on the streets of our city. Regardless of the circumstances, this is a crushing blow to any parent."" He added that most of the guns police recover are from out of state. ""Most likely, this gun has been purchased from out of state or somehow was obtained from out of state, was stolen and brought to New York City."" The gun was manufactured in Spain, Kelly said Sunday. In May, Shaaliver was arrested and was facing charges of attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon, according to Bronx District Attorney's Office spokesman Steven Reed. The prosecution was deferred, pending further investigation, Reed said. There was insufficient evidence to move forward, he added, explaining that a witness could not identify who shot him. 74 Cleveland police officers to face discipline after deadly pursuit .

"(CNN) -- Whether you're into fashion design, the culinary arts or watching famous pop stars make and break the dreams of hopeful singers, reality programming offers something for everyone. But if the multiple series dedicated to families with up to 19 kids (and counting) have taught us anything, it's that we're fresh out of original content. Marketed as ""the future of fashion design shows,"" NBC's ""Fashion Star"" premiered Tuesday. And despite mixed reviews, the Elle Macpherson-hosted show manages an innovative feel by borrowing bits and pieces from existing series. In other words, if ""Project Runway"" and ""Shark Tank"" were one show, that show would be called ""Fashion Star."" ""In 2012, there are so many channels and reality shows out there, it's hard to come up with a concept where everything is completely new,"" said Steve Carbone of RealitySteve.com. On the new NBC series, aspiring designers try to sell their fashions to retailers, just like entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to potential investors on ABC's ""Shark Tank."" Similarly, the network's other brainchild, ""The Voice,"" found success by adding rotating chairs and teams to ""American Idol's"" winning formula. (The model originated in the Netherlands as ""The Voice of Holland"" in 2010.) ""Let's face it,"" Carbone said, ""after the judges turn their chairs around, 'The Voice' becomes 'The X Factor.' Each judge has a team. Each team competes every week. Someone gets eliminated. ... It comes down to which personalities you like better."" Based on ""The X Factor's"" recent shake-up -- judges Paula Abdul and Nicole Scherzinger and host Steve Jones all got the boot -- it's clear audiences preferred the likes of ""Voice"" mentors Christina Aguilera, Cee Lo Green, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton. Boasting mentors like Jessica Simpson, Nicole Richie and designer John Varvatos (in addition to featuring clothing buyers from retail giants like Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue and H&M), ""Fashion Star's"" star power could be enough to attract viewers, said April Bernard, US Weekly's senior TV editor. ""(The show) doesn't feel as fresh as it could, even though everyone is touting it as a fresh new idea,"" Bernard said. While Hank Stuever of The Washington Post said the show deserves a shot for it its ""originality and conceptual pizzazz,"" the Los Angeles Times' Mary McNamara wrote: ""'Fashion Star is NBC's attempt to refurbish 'Project Runway.' ... It gets old really fast. As in, halfway through the pilot."" ""Fashion Star"" joins past and present fashion programs like ""24 Hour Catwalk,"" ""Launch My Line,"" ""The Fashion Show"" and CBS's short-lived ""The Cut."" But Lifetime's ""Project Runway,"" which aired on Bravo for the first five of its nine seasons, remains a juggernaut in the fashion arena. ""Knock-off shows that are lame imitations usually don't work, while innovation does,"" Realityblurred.com's Andy Dehnart wrote in an e-mail. This could be why the many ""Bachelor"" copycats, from ""Joe Millionaire"" to ""More to Love,"" haven't experienced the same success as ABC's long-running franchise, which now includes ""The Bachelorette"" and ""Bachelor Pad."" ""As stupid and silly as the show is, it's absolutely the gold standard for reality dating shows,"" said Carbone. None of the copycats found success, unless you include VH1 dating shows like ""Flavor of Love"" and ""I Love New York,"" Carbone added. ""VH1's version (of 'The Bachelor') is just a lot trashier."" ""The best kind of knockoff show just uses an existing idea as a jumping-off point,"" Dehnart said. ""'The Voice' succeeded and 'X Factor' failed because, while 'The Voice' borrowed from 'American Idol,' its format was new, different and interesting. And 'X Factor' was far too similar to what we already saw and grew tired of."" It seems, of late, there have been more green-lighted singing competition copycats than anything else. The CW and ABC's forthcoming singing competitions, ""The Star Next Door"" and ""Duets,"" respectively, are certainly variations of existing shows like ""American Idol,"" ""The X Factor,"" ""The Voice"" and ""The Sing-Off."" But don't count the impending singing shows out just yet, Dehnart warns. ""Success has less to do with whether a show is a knock-off than how compelling it is by itself,"" Dehnart said. ""On some level, 'American Idol' was a knockoff of the shows that preceded it, like 'Star Search.' Don't forget, ""The Real World"" featured seven or eight strangers living under the same roof for 17 years before ""Jersey Shore"" came along. ""Copycat shows aren't unique to reality TV,"" Dehnart said. ""Back before 'Survivor,' networks were churning out 'Friends' clones."" As long as new shows continue to add unique elements to existing reality programs, it seems they'll have a shot at ratings gold. After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.","Marketed as ""the future of fashion design shows,"" ""Fashion Star"" premiered Tuesday .

"(HLNtv.com) -- The father of two Southern California children who went missing after their mother was killed pleaded Tuesday for their suspected abductor to release his daughter. A massive manhunt is under way for James DiMaggio, whom law enforcement authorities describe as a friend of the mother, Christina Anderson. The whereabouts of Anderson's children, Hannah, 16, and Ethan, 8, are unknown. Investigators believe they may be with DiMaggio, 40, the owner and sole resident of the burned home where Anderson's body was found, along with the unidentified remains of a child. ""Jim, I can't fathom what you were thinking. The damage is done. I'm begging you to let my daughter go. You've taken everything else,"" Brett Anderson, the children's father, told reporters. ""Hannah, we all love you very much. If you have a chance, you take it, you run. You'll be found,"" he said. The father did not mention Ethan in his remarks, prompting a reporter to ask San Diego Sheriff's Department Lt. Glenn Giannantonio whether the child's remains might be those of the boy. ""We don't know who that is that was found in the rubble. It is a possibility that it's Ethan. It's a possibility that's another child that we haven't identified yet, or don't realize is missing yet,"" Giannantonio said. ""Right now, we just don't know, and we're praying that it wasn't Ethan,"" he said. Authorities are following up on tips and casting a wide net for DiMaggio and the children. ""We've received some information that either Texas or Canada may have been the destination he was heading to. Realistically, we don't know where they're going,"" Giannantonio said. ""We're looking everywhere."" Deputies and fire personnel were called to the scene of a residence and detached garage on fire in the enclave of Boulevard around 8 p.m. Sunday. While extinguishing the fire, personnel discovered the body of Anderson, 42, of Lakeside, California. Authorities believe she was murdered. They also recovered the remains of a child and the body of a dog. Once California authorities issued the Amber Alert, information was distributed to residents' cell phones statewide through the Wireless Emergency Alert program, according to the California Highway Patrol. The wireless program was instituted in December 2012, and this case is the first time is has been used statewide, CHP Public Information Officer Erin Komatsubara told HLN. On HLN's ""Raising America"" on Tuesday, the children's aunt, Andrea Saincome, said that DiMaggio has known the family for years and that it would not have been unusual for the mother and children to be at his house. ""There was nothing out of the ordinary,"" Saincome told HLN's Christi Paul. ""He seemed like a genuinely nice guy. He was close to the kids, and he was friends with my sister and my brother-in-law."" Police believe the children were last seen with their mother in Boulevard on Saturday. They were reported missing by their grandparents on Sunday. Giannantonio said he did not know what led them to believe their grandchildren were missing. According to Giannantonio, DiMaggio and Anderson had ""a close, platonic relationship."" Giannantonio would not release any details about how Anderson was killed, but said arson investigators believe they know how the fire was started.

"(CNN) -- Investigators are on the verge of solving the last of the Boston Strangler killings of the 1960s, thanks to new DNA tests and a sample secretly collected from a relative of longtime suspect Albert DeSalvo. DNA taken from a water bottle thrown away by one of DeSalvo's nephews is a ""familial match"" with genetic material preserved in the January 1964 killing of 19-year-old Mary Sullivan, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said Thursday. ""This is good evidence, strong evidence and reliable evidence, but it's not sufficient to close the case with absolute certainty,"" Conley told reporters. DNA from DeSalvo's remains is needed to prove ""once and for all"" that the onetime handyman was Sullivan's killer -- and perhaps to close other cases to which DeSalvo confessed. The Strangler killings terrorized Boston from mid-1962 to early 1964. Conley said 11 murders have been attributed to DeSalvo -- who confessed to the killings -- including Sullivan. He also confessed to two additional murders who were not suspected victims of the Strangler. City of Fear: Photos from the Boston strangler era, 1963 . DeSalvo was never charged with the murders. He was stabbed to death in 1973 while serving a life prison term for unrelated rapes. ""There was no forensic evidence to link Albert DeSalvo to Mary Sullivan's murder until today,"" Conley said. The new DNA match now excludes ""99.9%"" of the population as suspects, he said -- and now that a judge has approved DeSalvo's exhumation, the DNA match could be confirmed in ""a matter of days."" As for the rest of the victims, the developments ""give us a glimmer of hope that there can one day be finality, if not accountability,"" for their families, Conley said. The news has convinced Sullivan's nephew, Casey Sherman, who wrote a 2001 book in which he argued another man may have been behind the Strangler killings. He said Thursday that he was surprised his aunt's slaying was still being investigated and told reporters, ""I go where the evidence leads."" ""It's taken 49 years for police to legitimately say they got their man, and they'll probably be able to say that very soon,"" Sherman said. He spoke emotionally of the closure the news will bring to him and his mother, Diane Dodd, Sullivan's younger sister. ""It's amazing to me today to understand that people really did care what happened to my aunt, a 19-year-old girl heinously murdered in 1964,"" he said. But a lawyer for the DeSalvos told CNN the family was ""outraged, disgusted and offended"" by the decision to secretly take a DNA sample one of its members, a move she called ""unnecessary and creepy."" ""They feel victimized by this process,"" the attorney, Elaine Whitfield Sharp, said. ""This was an unwarranted invasion of privacy by a government agency. We have offered them DNA as recently as last year, there was no reason to sneak around to get it."" Conley said scientists tried several times in the late 1990s and early 2000s to isolate DNA evidence from semen found in Sullivan's body and on a blanket. They resumed their efforts last year, after a laboratory successfully salvaged DNA from decades-old material, and found what they believe is the unique genetic profile of Sullivan's killer. Serial Killers: Fast Facts . Despite an exhaustive search, investigators found no usable samples of DeSalvo's DNA to compare to the material from the crime scene. So Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said he had a detective from the police department's fugitive squad shadow DeSalvo relatives until he spotted one of the suspect's nephews throwing away a water bottle. ""That water bottle was tested, and the match came back,"" he said. ""We've been sitting on that information for a while, so that all the reports could come back, and we could put ourselves in a position to petition the court for an exhumation order, so that we can positively close that case up."" The nephew was working at an outdoor construction site when he threw away the plastic bottle, which was retrieved by plainclothes investigators, according to a law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Conley said authorities didn't ask the DeSalvo family for their cooperation, but he defended the secret collection of their DNA as ""a fair and legal and ethical method."" He said they ""did nothing wrong,"" but ""found themselves in the shadow of accusations that could never be fully proven or discounted."" ""We would probably have given them a lot of anxiety, perhaps, if we had approached them directly,"" he said. ""If this familial examination pointed us in a different directions, then we wouldn't have even have had to involve them any further."" DeSalvo's brother, Richard DeSalvo, offered blood and saliva samples at that time in hopes of proving his brother's innocence in 2001. Those tests had been unable to find a match between DeSalvo family DNA and the killings, but Conley discounted them Thursday because they weren't conducted by law enforcement. Sharp said Richard DeSalvo's DNA would have been a closer match than the nephew's, she said. And the family offered samples of Albert DeSalvo's DNA that are in control of an independent forensic scientist, she said. ""They said they would get back to us and they never did,"" she said. ""Instead, they went sneaking around."" CNN's Sheila Steffen and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: DeSalvos ""outraged, disgusted "" by secret DNA collection, their attorney says .

"Moscow (CNN) -- An American rock band, Bloodhound Gang, is in trouble with the Russian authorities over a stunt which saw one of its band members stuff the Russian flag into his pants and pull it out from his backside. The band member told the audience ""Don't tell Putin"" before whipping the flag between his legs -- beneath his trousers -- during a concert in Odessa, Ukraine, on Wednesday. He then tossed the flag into the crowd. The stunt, which was caught on video, was posted on YouTube and has gone viral in Russia and Ukraine. Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency named bass guitar player Jared Hasselhoff as the band member responsible. Now the band faces repercussions in Russia, where it has been barred from performing at the Kubana music festival, in a southern Russian territory, Krasnodar Krai, officials said. ""Talked to Krasnodar territory leadership. Bloodhound Gang packing suitcases. These idiots won't perform in Kubana,"" Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said on Twitter Friday.

"(CNN) -- The brutal civil war in Syria claimed more than 6,000 lives in March alone -- making it the deadliest month since the conflict began a little more than two years ago, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Monday. The group said 6,005 people were killed in Syria last month. That's more than all the deaths that occurred in the first nine months of the war. ""This will become the new normal, and the death toll figures will continue to rise,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the observatory. ""If the fighting continues as it is and there is no political solution for transition. Syria will be the new Somalia or Afghanistan, and we will never attain democracy in the coming years,"" he says. Syria's numbers: How they compare with past wars . The tally, which CNN cannot independently verify, does not include people who are held in detention centers or who have been kidnapped by rebels. Their fate is unknown. Rahman says the surge in deaths comes from a new intensity in fighting. ""There were many more violent clashes and many military operations conducted by both sides in this time period,"" he said. ""In addition there was heavy shelling in multiple areas by both sides and a suicide bombing in the capital which killed dozens."" In all, some 62,554 people, the opposition group says, have died in the conflict so far. The United Nations has put the figure higher. In February, it said more than 70,000 people are believed to have been killed. March's documented death toll, the observatory says, includes 298 children, 291 women,1,486 rebel fighters and 1,464 government soldiers. The actual death toll is probably higher, Rahman said. ""There's many missing, and many killed in prisons that we cannot account for,"" Rahman said. ""Both sides are hiding the true death toll figures so they may boost morale."" The rising bloodshed is also spreading hunger by interfering with food aid deliveries, the U.N. World Food Programme said Tuesday. ""It has become a struggle now to move food from one area to the other with our warehouses and trucks getting increasingly caught in the crossfire,"" said program spokesman Muhannad Hadi. Dispatchers often must call off deliveries to areas they know are in dire need. The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, began demonstrating for more freedom. That movement quickly morphed into a movement against President Bashar al-Assad, who was appointed president by Syria's parliament in 2000 after his father died. The government responded with a brutal crackdown -- with devastating results. Thousand died, 2 million were uprooted from their homes and more than 4 million are in dire need of humanitarian aid, from food to medical care, according to the United Nations.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haitians took recovery efforts into their own hands Thursday as aid workers trickled into the quake-battered capital where impassable roads, damaged docks and clogged airstrips slowed the arrival of critically needed assistance. Using chisels, blowtorches and bare hands, one group of Haitians worked for 24 hours to free a man pinned under a collapsed school; still others -- possibly including students -- were trapped inside. Across town, an 11-year-old girl pleaded for water and screamed in pain as a group of people painstakingly tried to lift a piece of metal off her right leg. After sunset, they managed to set her free. Those scenes of Haitians banding together to free their neighbors played out across the capital while the few rescue crews who managed to make it into the hillside city came face-to-face with the death and destruction caused by the massive quake. The stench of corpses wafted in the air after two days under the hot sun, and throughout the city people covered their faces to block the odor. At one of the city's cemeteries, people were opening old crypts and shoving the corpses of quake victims into them before resealing them, CNN's Anderson Cooper reported. As night fell on the streets of Port-au-Prince, there were signs of progress. CNN correspondent Chris Lawrence watched as workers loaded bodies of quake victims, which had been piled on the sides of roads, into the basket of a front-loader tractor. It deposited them into blood-stained dump trucks lining the street. Watch as dogs help in rescue efforts . Roads leading from the port city's dock into town were buckled about 5 feet high, and large cargo ships couldn't tie up at the damaged port. Rubble-strewn roads, downed trees and a battered communications network hampered humanitarian groups trying to get supplies to victims, and thousands of people left homeless by Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake roamed the streets. Raymond Joseph, the Haitian ambassador to the United States, said Thursday that the priority of arriving military personnel will be to clear the roads. Watch a student tell how she tried to flee . ""The Port-au-Prince airport is going to be overloaded [with] supplies and there's going to be no way to distribute it because the roads are blocked,"" he told ""The Situation Room,"" calling for heavy machinery to move the debris. U.S. flights into the Port-au-Prince airport were grounded several times Thursday because ramp space was too crowded, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration said. As of Thursday afternoon, 34 planes were on the ground in Haiti and up to 12 planes were in a holding pattern waiting to land, an FAA official said. One problem, the official said, is the lack of resources to unload planes on the ground. ""We don't have enough water, we don't have enough medical supplies, we don't have enough blankets,"" Dave Toycen, president of World Vision and a 35-year veteran of disaster response, told ""Larry King Live."" ""People aren't getting the help they need and it's just unacceptable."" CNN's Cooper came across the family of a 28-year-old woman named Brigitte Jean Baptiste, on their way to the cemetery. They were pushing a wheelbarrow with a coffin carrying her body precariously balanced on top of it. The woman was pulled from the rubble alive Thursday morning, but her family couldn't find a doctor to treat her. ""She could have been saved, but we didn't find any help,"" a family member said. See CNN's complete coverage of the quake . The rescue and recovery efforts have become priorities for nations across the globe, including the United States. ""Even as we move as quickly as possible, it will take hours and in many cases days, to get all of our people and resources on the ground,"" President Obama said Thursday morning. ""Right now in Haiti, roads are impassable, the main port is badly damaged, communications are just beginning to come online and aftershocks continue.""

Bush and Bill Clinton to help lead humanitarian and fundraising efforts. Watch as social-media sites help in search . During an appearance before the House Democratic Caucus Retreat later Thursday, Obama again addressed recovery efforts in Haiti, saying, ""My national security team understands that I will not put up with any excuses for us not doing the very best in this time of tragedy.""

Crowley said he estimates at least 30 countries have pledged meaningful assistance that has already reached Haiti or is on its way.

Watch the chaotic situation outside a hospital . Precise casualty estimates were impossible to determine, and Ban said it will be days before an ""educated guess"" can be made about what he thinks will be a high death toll, with authorities saying it could be in the thousands or even the hundreds of thousands. At least 22 U.N. peacekeepers were killed in the quake, Ban said Thursday. Also among the dead is Joseph Serge Miot, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Port-au-Prince.

Watch as U.N. chief gives grim update . The United States and other countries were dispatching medical supplies, facilities and personnel. As of Thursday, more than 300 military personnel were on the ground in Haiti. That number is expected to top at least 5,000 by early next week with the arrival of 3,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and 2,200 Marines from the USS Bataan amphibious group of ships, according to military officials. The U.S. Navy's USS Carl Vinson is expected to arrive Friday, and the hospital ship Comfort is preparing to deploy Saturday morning to Port-au-Prince.

"(CNN) -- Over the years Tottenham Hotspur's supporters have suffered anti-Semitic abuse and until recently visiting supporters would hiss, in an effort to mimic the sound of the gas chambers that sent six million Jews to their deaths during the Holocaust. So just how offensive is the use of the word ""Yid"" at football matches? British Prime Minister David Cameron has been told that his view on Spurs fans being able to use the ""Yid"" word at football matches is ""ludicrous"" by an anti-racism group. Last week, the English Football Association told fans they could face prosecution if they used the word, a term which at different times throughout history has been used by Jews and also to abuse them. A north London-based club, Spurs are known for having a large number of Jewish supporters, with a section of Spurs fans having attempted to reclaim the ""Y word"" by referring to themselves as the ""Yid Army"" and chanting it at matches. ""There's a difference between Spurs fans self-describing themselves as Yids and someone calling someone a Yid as an insult,"" Cameron told the UK-based Jewish Chronicle newspaper. ""You have to be motivated by hate. Hate speech should be prosecuted -- but only when it's motivated by hate."" But Cameron's views have been dismissed as 'ludicrous' by Race for Sport, a group which prides itself on ""promoting fairness, justice and equality within all sports."" David Neita, a spokesperson for the group and a member of the Society of Black Lawyers, says the attempt by Tottenham fans to suggest they have reclaimed the word ""is an insult to anybody's intelligence."" He added: ""Tottenham fans can be excused for attempting to deflect the abuse they received as neither the football club nor the FA previously took any action against the anti-Semitism voiced by other London clubs. ""Once anti-Semitism is being highlighted and prosecuted that is not longer a defense, if it ever was. Tottenham fans have neither the right nor the moral authority to do so."" Cameron has also come in for criticism from Peter Herbert, a leading lawyer and chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, who says the Prime Minister's comments ""actually condone anti-Semitism or racism."" ""Football is a part of society and not separate from it, so the Prime Minister has to really think what he is saying because he legitimizes anti-Semitism and that is a sad thing for any parliamentarian to do,"" Herbert told Sky Sports. ""You cannot have people breaking the criminal law on Saturday afternoon and saying it is OK because we have a badge of honor."" British comedian David Baddiel, a leading campaigner against racial hatred towards the Jewish community, also believes the word should not be used by Tottenham fans. Baddiel, a Jewish Chelsea supporter, attacked Cameron's position on the matter in his blog on the Guardian newspaper's website. ""The fact is that whatever its origins, their continuing use of the Y-word legitimizes and sustains the racist abuse aimed at Spurs by other fans,"" he writes. ""It's a call and response dynamic, like many at football matches."" Only in a small boxed off section in the Daily Mirror does Cameron receive any real support. Writing in the tabloid, Darren Alexander, joint chairman of the Spurs Supporters' Trust, hailed Cameron as ""the first person to speak with any common sense on this matter."" Alexander added: ""It is nice to see somebody who understands that word can have two meanings to two different sets of people."" But Cameron is not alone in receiving criticism with the FA also coming in for blame with several commentators claiming the organization is going after the wrong people. Writing in the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, Anshel Pfeffer argues more should be done to punish those club's whose fans persist in anti-Semitic chanting, rather than Tottenham fans who he believes do not use the term in an offensive manner. ""How difficult is it to understand that when a team with a wide Jewish fan base and prominent Jewish businesspeople among its executives proudly call themselves 'Yids', there is nothing anti-Semitic about it,"" he asks. ""It would be even complimentary to Jews if it was a half decent club. But when supporters of rival Chelsea or Arsenal sing the ""the Yids are going to Auschwitz,"" accompanied by the hissing sounds of gas, that is rank racism."" David Aaronovitch, a columnist for The Times also agrees that the FA' s position on the issue is skewed. ""The problem with the Y-word is not Spurs fans' use of it, but other clubs' supporters' racism,"" he told the newspaper. ""It seems bizarre to me that the focus of the action by the FA should be the people who are not the problem.""","British Prime Minister David Cameron backs Tottenham fans' right to use the word 'Yid'

"(CNN) -- Venezuela has thwarted a plan by two paramilitary groups to kill President Nicolas Maduro, state-run VTV reported Monday. Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres said members of the groups, made up of nine Colombian citizens, were arrested Sunday in the country's northwest before they were able to enter the capital, Caracas, with heavy weapons. Intelligence officials are tracking a third group, he said. ""This may be part of a plan that was orchestrated from Colombia to kill President Maduro and de-stabilize the Venezuelan government,"" he said. The two nations have had a contentious relationship since 2007 when then-President Hugo Chavez said he was cutting ties with Colombia and especially former President Alvaro Uribe. He said the Colombian president had bowed to pressure from Washington ""to get rid of Chavez."" In March of this year, Maduro struck a similar tone, accusing Uribe of hatching a plan to send a paramilitary force into Venezuela to kill him. An attorney for Uribe called Maduro ""a desperate person who holds power illegitimately."" Maduro was sworn in as president on April 19 after winning a tightly contested election against Henrique Capriles Radonski. Election officials credited Maduro with 51% of the vote. The election followed the death of Chavez, who died in March following a long battle with cancer. He was 58. While both Maduro and Capriles have publicly called for peace after the announcement of the tight election results, tensions have been running high in Venezuela. Venezuela's opposition has filed a lawsuit with the country's Supreme Court, contesting the results, citing election irregularities that totaled more than 180 pages. Ahead of the suit, Capriles told CNN affiliate Globovision that the results were illegitimate and new elections should be held. ""According to the law,"" he said, ""what should happen would be a new election, without any of the irregularities that we have denounced.""","The government says two paramilitary groups plotted to kill Maduro .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown once put out an album named ""Graffiti."" Now, he could find himself removing it. That's one of the tasks that the singer will have to do -- with others including beach cleanup or work for Caltrans, the California agency responsible for highway, bridge and rail construction and maintenance -- per a judge's order Friday. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin signed off on 1,000 hours of such ""community labor"" for Brown as agreed to by the singer's camp and prosecutors. The judge also reinstated probation for Brown ""under the original terms and conditions"" that stemmed from his previous run-ins with the law, incidents that in some ways have defined him as much as his talents and popularity as an artist. Brown sat quietly through Friday's court hearing in Los Angeles, with two brief exceptions: When he told Brandlin, ""yes,"" he accepted the agreement and later that he had no further questions. The judge closed the session by telling Brown he must contact his probation officer within 48 hours. His next court appearance is set to start at 2 p.m. November 20. The dropping of a hit-and-run charge against the singer on Thursday laid the groundwork for Friday's action. The accuser in that case, Olga Gure, told investigators Brown ""went ballistic"" and screamed at her after his Range Rover rear-ended her Mercedes on a Los Angeles street. Judge revokes Brown's probation . The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photograph of him and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene because he allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said. When Brown tried to grab the camera, Tran screamed, ""Don't touch her, don't touch her,"" Gure said. Whatever was documented in the police report, Brown's lawyer said this week that Gure ""did not want to pursue this."" Mark Geragos said that the accuser did not get any money in her settlement with his client. This incident was one of several high-profile headaches Brown has had over the years. The most well known offense came in February 2009, when he was charged with domestic violence for punching his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. The altercation left the face of Rihanna, also a chart-topping singer, bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards. Rihanna shows support in court for Chris Brown . He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years probation and ordered to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service."" The judge allowed him to serve the sentence in Richmond, Virginia, under the direct supervision of the police chief. In a court filing in February, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the community labor. District Attorney Jackie Lacey said then the paperwork the singer submitted to prove he'd done the work was ""at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting."" Geragos fired back, calling the prosecution's motion ""fraudulent."" Judge Brandlin made a point Friday not to pick sides on this debate over Brown's previous service, saying ""the court does not make any findings regarding the alleged violation in this matter.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday that he has asked Tokyo Electric Power Co. to decommission two more reactors at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Abe called for the decommissioning of Reactors 5 and 6 ""as soon as possible"" as he visited the plant, wearing protective gear, to look at efforts to contain leaks from tanks holding huge volumes of toxic water at the plant. Less than two weeks ago, his government said it would spend about $470 million to try to tackle the contaminated water crisis at the plant, which was damaged by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck northeast Japan in March 2011. Life goes on despite uncertainty in Fukushima . It also follows the announcement that Tokyo will host the Olympic Games in the summer of 2020.

"(CNN) -- The fatal gang rape of a young woman in the Indian capital of New Delhi sparked weeks of angry protests and prompted heated debates about the pervasiveness of sexual violence in Indian society. CNN asked people in India and the Indian diaspora for their thoughts on the case and the subsequent charges brought against six people, and also asked women for their personal experiences. Responses ranged from anger at the system, which they feel failed the young woman who died, to recollections of the harassment they have suffered personally. ""I have been hooted at, I've been called names and told to dress modestly, and let me remind you this is from people my own age and not older conservative people,"" said charity consultant Meera Vijayann from Bangalore. iReporter: Rape 'still not seen as a human rights violation in India' ""This girl could have been me, it could have been any of my friends and no-one would have taken us seriously."" Proposals to install ""fast track"" courts for rape cases marked a promising start, she said, but she added that it would take more than just statutes to stop such tragedies. Violence against women in India is widespread. More than 220,000 incidents were reported in 2011 alone, according to Indian government statistics. Human rights activists point out that, due to under reporting, the real figure is most likely much higher. But it's not just the statistics -- it's the mindset, many Indians said. Following the attack, there was further outrage when the Indian president's son, Abhijeet Mukherjee, dismissed women who had flocked to the streets to protest against the case as ""dented and painted,"" comments for which he later apologized. Read more: The perils of being a woman in India . Such victim-blaming, they said, must stop. ""There is a sexist mindset, politicians have made silly remarks about women and how they should wear modest clothes, not go to parties,"" Vijayann said. ""If they make the laws how will it benefit us? People have to change the way they think."" Despite such comments making headlines, many Indian men were quick to express their outrage at the attack. Akash Bhattacharya, a software engineer from Bangalore, attended some of the protests and candlelight vigils that erupted in Indian cities after reports of the case emerged in local media. He said he had felt ""ashamed"" as a man to hear the news and called for a shift in attitudes towards women and how they are treated. iReporter: 'I'm ashamed as a man in my own country' ""Harsher punishment will stop a case here and there, but that will not change our mind set,"" he said. ""When will our conscience overpower our instincts?"" Siddharth Katragadda, an artist and writer from India now living in San Diego, California, said that for the first time in India's history, ""We're realizing that we cannot protect our women by hiding them behind tradition and values."" India, he said, was experiencing a schism between a value system that relied on shutting women away to one where external forces such as the police and the criminal justice system were looked to for support and justice. ""For centuries, India protected its women against such crimes by hiding [them] behind strict rules of personal fashion and even stricter traditions,"" he said. ""Now, urban Indians look -- as the West does -- to its laws and policing to protect its women. What we're seeing is clash of those opposing cultures."" More: 'India has woken up and realized that change is needed' Nonetheless, he was also quick to point out that India is far from the only country with endemic sexual violence. ""Rapes are crimes of opportunity that occur in every corner of the world, not just India,"" he said. Five of the suspects were formally charged on Thursday with the murder, rape and kidnapping in a New Delhi court, senior police officials said, while another is awaiting age tests to determine if he is old enough to be tried in an adult court. Several of the charges carry the death penalty if they are convicted. There are hopes amongst Indians that the potent mix of public anger, political nervousness and global pressure may impress on authorities the need for action to prevent such crimes happening again. The sheer horror of the case has also increased calls from some protesters for use of the death penalty, which is legal but rarely used in India. Images of angry demonstrators carrying mock hangman's nooses and signs calling for the suspects to be killed have left little doubt that there are some in India keen for this sentence to be carried out if the men are convicted. Others, however, were more circumspect, citing sanctity for life, or the possibility of rehabilitation or change. ""I believe rape is the most grave crime as the victims die two times, once physically and one emotionally, so the [suspects] must be given severe punishment [if convicted] which can make them realize how painful it is,"" said Dorjay Namgail from Chandigarh, northern India, on Facebook. ""But I think we should abandon capital punishment. Every human being has the capacity [to] transform themselves into a good, law abiding citizen."" More: Remembering the New Delhi gang rape victim . The sheer tragedy of the case has also prompted some outside of India to take action, from sharing thoughts and condolences on social media to organizing vigils in honor of the unnamed victim. Reena Combo, a media specialist living in Birmingham, England, whose family comes from New Delhi, decided to organize a vigil after her tweets about the case sparked an outpouring of emotional responses and pleas to take action. ""People were saying 'you work in media -- you can do something!'"" she said. ""So I decided to put together a vigil in my home town."" ""A lot of people want to pay their respects and show solidarity for this woman who died in such a traumatic way. Hopefully now Indian women will feel more empowered to speak out.""

"(CNN) -- Chief Warrant Officer Christopher Royal survived the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, with two bullet wounds to his back. The slugs left him with nerve damage that numbs his left arm and leg and sends streaking pains ""shooting up and down my back."" And it's left invisible scars as well -- post-traumatic stress that has hurt his ability to perform his duties as a computer specialist and left him unable to feel safe in his own country. ""I really feel more comfortable downrange. I really do,"" said Royal, who served in Iraq four times and in Afghanistan once. ""I think I would be more comfortable living in Iraq right now than living in the United States."" At 41, he's preparing to leave the Army at the end of September. But first, he's going to testify against the man accused of opening fire on his fellow soldiers at Fort Hood, troops who were preparing to ship out to Afghanistan and Iraq. Prosecutors will start presenting their case against Maj. Nidal Hasan on Tuesday in a court-martial at Fort Hood, outside Killeen, Texas. Royal, who escaped the gunfire only to go back into the processing center in an attempt to tackle Hasan, will be one of the witnesses against him. ""I had escaped without being wounded,"" Royal said. ""I got about fifty meters (yards) in the parking lot, and then I said, 'I can't let him get away with this.' And I wasn't even thinking that I didn't have a weapon. I just knew that I couldn't let him get away."" Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors hope to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a ""progressive radicalization,"" giving presentations in defense of suicide bombing and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime. A military judge ruled last week that the prosecution can introduce evidence of Hasan's Internet searches on jihad and the Taliban in the days and hours before the rampage, but has deferred a ruling on whether they can introduce other materials. Hasan will represent himself in his court-martial. He told the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, that he plans to call two witnesses during the proceedings. The case has been delayed repeatedly since it was initially set to begin in March 2012, most notably after an appeals court delayed the case over the question of whether the beard Hasan has grown while in custody could be forcibly shaved. Meanwhile, Royal copes with his pain and stress by taking near-scalding baths and running, including a roughly 70-mile jaunt from Fort Hood to Austin. But he says he can't deal with crowds any more -- not even on the post. ""I don't even really go to the mall anymore,"" he said. ""I can't take my child to Disneyland, because I can't deal with it."" As for Hasan, he said, ""I have forgiven him."" ""I can't hold that grudge,"" Royal said. ""It's just too much. I won't allow him to consume any more energy for my life than he has already done, and so I have released him. ""I have forgiven him completely,"" he said. ""It's not up to me to punish him. His punishment will come.""","Testimony in accused Fort Hood killer Nidal Hasan's court-martial starts Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Now that there is a respite in the debate in Congress over Syria, the budget wars are resuming. Regardless of how tired the public has become of watching the parties wrangle over spending levels, congressional Republicans have made it clear that they intend to keep the pressure on the president. The first round of the fight will come with the decision over whether to extend the continuing resolution to fund the government beyond its expiration date of September 30. House Republican leaders have already been forced to delay the vote because Tea Party Republicans have threatened to vote no. They are demanding that the bill shut down funding for the new health care law, a key part of which goes in effect on October 1. The second round of the fight will take place in October, when Congress will need to raise the debt ceiling so that the federal government can meet its obligations. Republican leaders have said that in exchange for their votes on both measures, the administration will have to agree to steep cuts in domestic spending. As they have been doing since 2010, Republicans want to use these budget battles to depict themselves as the party of ""fiscal responsibility"" and to sway public opinion wars toward a national agenda that centers on reducing the size of domestic programs. Based on what we've seen thus far, the strategy will not work over the long term. While the GOP has been successful at preventing President Obama from dealing with other issues -- and now these debates can help put such issues as immigration reform at risk by pushing them off the legislative schedule -- their overall strategy can diminish public support for deficit reduction. Nor is it likely to make Republicans look like the responsible party of fiscal conservatism. Why won't it work? Republicans have chosen to fight over spending cuts through dramatic high stakes maneuvers, such as shutting down the federal government or refusing to raise the debt ceiling that raise more questions about their party than about the issue at hand. Q&A: The lowdown on the shutdown . The Republicans have watched as public opinion has turned against them. According to a recent CNN poll, 51% of those surveyed would blame the Republicans for a government shutdown. By dealing with budgetary issues through these risky tactics, which some say threaten the economy, the party hurts its ability to persuade the public that the Republicans are interested in seriously pursuing fiscal restraint, as opposed to using this issue for purely partisan purposes. Not only does this strategy raise questions about the Republicans as a party, but it makes the issue of spending cuts appear more like a weapon than a topic of discussion. The Republicans have also harmed their cause through their long-standing inconsistency about achieving fiscal responsibility. Conservatives have been pointing to this problem for over a decade, as many had lambasted President George W. Bush as a ""Big Government Conservative"" who supported expansions of government such as the Medicare prescription drug program. In the past two years, Republican proposals have concentrated most heavily on spending cuts for programs serving the disadvantaged while simultaneously promoting tax cuts that would only worsen the fiscal imbalance that the nation faces. By doing so, Republican arguments about fiscal conservatism have seemed more like an attack on the poor than a desire to balance the budget. Obama has tried to capitalize on this perception. On ABC, he said, ""There's no serious economist out there that would suggest that, if you took the Republican agenda of slashing education further, slashing Medicare further, slashing research and development further, slashing investments in infrastructure further, that would reverse some of these trends of inequality."" Nor have Republicans done much to respond to the growing data that deficit reduction does little to help the economy. New research has cast great doubt on an economics paper that has been cited around the globe by champions of austerity in public spending. Spending cuts in European nations have not produced the economic results promised -- in fact the opposite -- and that has also shaken supporters of the GOP here at home. Yet, Republicans have not offered much of a response, other than to stick to their pre-existing script. Republicans will need to do more to counteract this growing evidence about the flaws of their arguments. There was a time when Republicans could legitimately claim to be the party of fiscal conservatism. President Dwight D. Eisenhower made balancing the budget one of his signature issues, devoting much of his second term fighting against all kinds of spending, including on the military, against the Democratic Congress. While he was unsuccessful, Democrats and Republicans, as well as large number of voters, respected his belief in the program and the fact that he was willing to take political risks to fight for this policy. If Republicans want to regain some of what Eisenhower achieved for the party, and to win over skeptics who are doubting whether deficit reduction really should be the kind of priority issue that Republicans say it should be, they will have to change course. Starting in the coming weeks, they might want to begin by avoiding a government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling so that they can argue their case in a way that has a chance of persuading more Americans to back their ideas and their party. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Republicans are on a suicidal course on budget issues .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Inside a former church on a suburban London street, a room has been designed to recreate the conditions found in Siberian salt mines. CNN writer Anouk Lorie relaxes in Britain's first salt cave, in Wandsworth, London. The floor and walls are covered with a thick layer of natural sea salt while particles of dry rock salt are pumped into the room. Welcome to an Eastern European style salt cave which claims to rid asthma and allergy sufferers of their breathing problems through ""salt therapy,"" also known as halotherapy. With the sound of waves playing in the background and the sand-like mound of salt underfoot, the place could easily be mistaken for an exotic snow beach. Before entering the salt chamber, visitors are required to wear a shower cap to cover their hair and shoes to preserve the salt's purity. During each hour-long session they simply sit back, relax and put their feet up while soaking up the saturated air and tranquil atmosphere. Salt therapy claims to work by clearing the airways of mucus and reducing inflammation triggered by allergies to dust, pollen or pollution. Minerals including potassium and magnesium are said to clean out mucus blocking the airways. The treatment is widely used in Eastern Europe and Russia, where people with chronic breathing disorders often spend two to three hours per day in underground salt grottos. The Russian government even approved ""salt caves"" for medical use in 1995. In the U.S., the trend has been adopted in the Chicago area with the popular Galos Cave. Several spas in other parts of the country have also installed salt breathing rooms. In 2006, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study on patients with cystic fibrosis who used this kind of saline therapy for 48 weeks. The study found that it was a safe and effective additional therapy for patients. The benefits of salt therapy were first discovered in the late 1800s when workers in Siberian salt mines were found to suffer from a surprisingly small number of respiratory problems. Familiar with such treatments in her hometown, Sofia Benke from Hungary was therefore surprised when she moved to the UK two years ago and discovered there were no salt caves in the country. Have you used the salt cave? Did it work for you? Would you visit one? Tell us in the SoundOff box below . ""I was suffering from sinus problems and antibiotics didn't work. I had heard so many stories of how salt caves had treated friends' problems, so I decided to open one in London,"" the 30-year-old told CNN. The salt, which has no additives, is shipped in from Lithuania. Benke's patients vary from six-month-olds to 65-year-olds and most are asthmatic children who come in with their parents. Ideally, treatment lasts one to two weeks and patients need to be in the cave for one to two hours every day, Benke says. The room's temperature and salt concentration depending on the patients' condition. The benefits are then said to last for up to 12 months. Each session costs around $56 and the first one is free. Many of the patients have reported positive results. Twenty-eight-year-old yoga instructor Tish Webster, who has always suffered from hay fever and severe allergies to dust, told CNN she noticed results after three sessions. ""I noticed first thing in the morning I wasn't as congested as I usually am. Having now done ten sessions, I haven't yet taken an allergy tablet this year, which is incredible for me."" Despite the positive testimonials, the therapy has not yet been recognized by the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and at least one study suggests the therapy should be used as a complementary therapy, not as an alternative. Dr Elaine Vickers of Asthma UK, said: ""It's currently impossible for us to say whether or not salt caves are beneficial for people with asthma. However, some people say they find them helpful. ""Our advice to people with asthma is to follow the recommendations of your doctor or asthma nurse, and to keep them informed if you decide to try a complementary treatment such as halotherapy."" Other health practitioners say stopping medication like steroids for asthma and only opting for alternative care can be dangerous and counter-productive. But, according to Benke, some of her patients have stopped medication, not because she urged them to. ""I would never do that,"" she said. The reason for this is because their symptoms were no longer present after undergoing salt therapy, she said.","A salt cave clinic in London says it can treat respiratory illnesses like asthma .

"DALLAS (CNN) -- There was no impassioned plea to pass immigration reform. But the image was unmistakable. The sight of former President George W. Bush welcoming newly sworn-in citizens at a naturalization ceremony at his library and museum in Dallas on Wednesday offered a sharp contrast to the hardening opposition to immigration legislation in Washington. Senate passes sweeping immigration bill . Speaking for only five minutes, Bush did weigh in on the immigration system he tried but failed to reform during his second term in office. ""The laws governing the immigration system aren't working. The system is broken,"" Bush told the crowd. ""I don't intend to get involved in the politics or the specifics of policy, but I do hope there is a positive resolution to the debate,"" Bush said in a soft endorsement of reform efforts on Capitol Hill. ""I hope during the debate that we keep a benevolent spirit in mind. We understand the contributions immigrants make to our country. "" Twenty new citizens from 12 different countries, including two members of the Armed Forces, were sworn in at the naturalization ceremony conducted along with officials from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. ""It's an honor to call you fellow Americans,"" Bush told the newcomers. Following Bush's remarks, each freshly sworn in citizen lined up to receive their naturalization certificate and a handshake from the former president. CNN Poll: Generational divide over immigration . Among the newly naturalized at the George W. Bush Center in Dallas, Danny Diaz admitted he illegally crossed the U.S.- Mexico border in 1994 in a long journey from his native Guatemala. It took nearly a decade for Diaz to receive legal residency status and finally citizenship. ""It's a long wait. It's a hard wait, too,"" he said. ""But if you work for it and you prove you know how to behave in this country, everything comes through."" Diaz called immigration reform ""a good thing."" ""There's a lot of good people out there who don't have papers,"" he said. Lance Cpl. Antonio Miguel Villaceran, a U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, was unaware Bush would be in attendance. ""I love what George Bush is doing right now,"" he said. Akshaya Bandaru, who immigrated to the U.S. from India, received a private meeting with Bush along with the other newcomers and their families. Bandaru said the former president was funny. ""I told him I was going into medical school and he said 'I hope it's geriatrics,'"" Bandaru said. Bush pushes for progress on immigration . The former president has stayed out of domestic politics since leaving the White House in January 2009, and the timing of Bush's speech and a meeting of House Republicans to discuss the issue appears to be a coincidence. Hannah Abney, spokeswoman for the Bush presidential center, told CNN that the Texas event had been planned for a couple of months. The former Republican president tried but failed to pass immigration reform during his second term in the White House, due in part to opposition from Republican members of Congress. House immigration plan includes border security trigger . In an interview with ABC News last week while in Africa, Bush noted the importance of fixing a ""broken system"" and he said immigration reform ""has a chance to pass."" ""It's a very difficult bill to pass because there are a lot of moving parts and the legislative process can be ugly. But it looks like they are making some progress,"" Bush told ABC. Asked if it will hurt the GOP if Republicans fail to pass the bill, Bush told ABC that ""the reason to pass immigration reform is not to bolster a Republican Party -- it's to fix a system that's broken."" Bush honors tradition, holds tongue on Obama . The bill passed by the Senate late last month includes an eventual pathway to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. That provision is opposed by many House Republicans, who consider it ""amnesty."" Bush's brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, last week urged the GOP-led House to pass the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform package with a few additional requirements. Jeb Bush, who is considering a 2016 bid for the White House, made his comments in a opinion piece he co-wrote in the Wall Street Journal. Jeb Bush urges House to pass immigration reform . The former president spoke about immigration reform at a conference last December. ""America is a nation of immigrants. Immigrants have helped build the country that we have become, and immigrants can help build a dynamic tomorrow,"" he said. ""As our nation debates the proper course of action relating to immigration, I hope we do so with a benevolent spirit and keep in mind the contribution of immigrants,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- It started because Ryan Gosling gave someone a ride home. When the actor was given the script for ""Drive,"" he was also given the option to choose the director. ""Whether I did it or not depended on who was going to direct it,"" Gosling said. Having seen the films of Nicolas Winding Refn (""Bronson,"" ""Valhalla Rising""), he thought the Danish director might be the right guy. But then they had an ""awful meeting,"" probably because Winding Refn had the flu, and Gosling wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. One catch: Winding Refn couldn't drive and needed a lift. Gosling reluctantly obliged. ""On the ride home, we were just playing music and driving,"" Gosling said from a New York hotel suite with his director nearby, eating his lunch of soup and hard-boiled eggs. Looking back at that meeting, he said, they had ""an epiphany"" when the REO Speedwagon song ""Can't Fight This Feeling"" came on the radio and Gosling started singing along. ""I think we both saw the movie in that moment. Conversation wasn't really part of that moment. It wasn't conceptual. It wasn't based on ideas. It was based on this experience, this quick experience. It was only 10 minutes in the car, but it was a feeling that was a relatable experience, and we thought, 'Why not make a movie about driving that's really about driving? Not stunts?' It came to us in a flash, and we both had that as a benchmark."" ""Drive"" was the first time Gosling got to pick a director for one of his movies and take charge. It was the first time since 2002's ""Murder by Numbers"" that he'd made a ""really violent film, a gory film."" It sparked a daredevil streak in his career, which is reaching a new height (or low, according to some critics) with his latest Winding Refn collaboration. The controversial and ultraviolent ""Only God Forgives"" features a lot of limbs and other body parts getting lopped off, drenched in blood and red light. One act of violence begets another in an elliptical and relentless revenge cycle that includes a man sticking his hand inside a dead woman's body, perhaps to reclaim her womb. But for Gosling, it was one way to put an end to any idea that he was just a Hollywood heartthrob (or sexy Internet meme), his pretty-boy face as bruised and beaten up as possible on the film's poster, a trademark of Winding Refn's. Gosling's career, which started as on the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" (along with Mouseketeers Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera and Keri Russell), gained traction in 2004 with the tearjerker romance ""The Notebook,"" which won him such accolades as Best Kiss at the MTV Movie Awards. See more kid stars all grown up . But it wasn't until ""Half Nelson"" in 2006 (which got him an Oscar nomination) and ""Lars and the Real Girl"" in 2007 (which got him his first Golden Globe nomination) that he was taken seriously by the critics. He could have had his pick of projects, but instead he took a break for a few years, until he found a handful of films by auteur-type directors that would break convention and would mean something to him: ""Blue Valentine,"" with director Derek Cianfrance (with whom he reteamed on this year's ""The Place Beyond the Pines""), and ""Drive."" Winding Refn, like Gosling, was placed in a prime position to do ""more of a Hollywood film"" after the critical acclaim and commercial success of ""Drive."" He chose not to. ""I admire that,"" Gosling said. ""He makes films for personal reasons, and that was an experience I wanted to have, to keep having. It's contagious."" When he worked with a revolving door of directors on Hollywood films, Gosling said, it wasn't satisfying. ""I just feel, after a while, like it's serial dating,"" he said. ""And at a certain point, you want to settle down and see what's really there. It takes more than one film to do that, because you waste a lot of time on a film getting to know somebody, being polite, getting to see how the other person works. It's nice to have a history with someone, so you can keep in touch with each other, so you can trust what they're saying to you."" Gosling knew that ""Only God Forgives"" would be a ""difficult film"" that would ""divide people"" (and divide them it has; the festival audience booed the film at Cannes). Still, he plunged into it headfirst, even though, he admitted, he didn't know what it was. ""Nic makes his movies chronologically,"" he said. ""You find it while you're making it. You have to just follow your intuition, and there's really no other experience making a film quite like that. It's like taking a drug. You go on a trip."" Since his job was to have the same deadpan expression no matter what happened, Gosling calls ""Only God Forgives"" ""basically a silent film."" ""We're so accustomed to words,"" Winding Refn said. ""Turning down the sound on a television is an alien concept."" With little conversation between them, the characters become ciphers, inscrutable (save for Kristin Scott Thomas as Gosling's psycho of a mother, who has a lot to say, often in the crudest terms possible). Without words, most of the communication is physical and symbolic. Gosling holds out his hands, either to examine them, to reach for a prostitute he wants to pretend is his girlfriend or to punch the cop who killed his brother. He leaves the amputations to other characters, but Gosling isn't tentative about violence onscreen. (He counts ""Rambo: First Blood"" and ""Blue Velvet"" as some of his childhood favorites.) Some critics objected to the lack of dialogue, lack of character motivation and style over substance in ""Only God Forgives,"" but Winding Refn enjoys the criticism. ""If everyone loves it, we're not different,"" he said. ""How can we all love and hate the same things? If people love it for the exact same reason other people hate it, it penetrates. Your penetration has been successful."" And it's this lesson that Gosling has absorbed for his first film as a director, ""How to Catch a Monster,"" which he's currently editing. On the set of that film, which includes his ""Drive"" co-star Christina Hendricks, he practiced the most peaceful, nonviolent thing he ever saw Winding Refn do: listen to his own instincts first but listen to everyone else involved in the project as well. ""There was a guy auditioning for a stunt role, like Guy No. 15, who gets his head chopped off,"" Gosling said. ""Nic talked to him for like two hours: what he thought of the story, what he thought about the film. He just really engages everybody and collects their ideas, and I think it's a really smart way to work. All these people come to you with an entire history and they can offer a perspective to what you're doing, whether you like it or not. It seems strange now to work in a situation where people are closed off to everything but their own ideas.""

"(CNN) -- A woman known as Juror B37 thought writing an anonymous book about her experiences on the George Zimmerman trial was a good idea. Many people, including a powerful and tireless group of outraged Twitter users, thought otherwise. News reports surfaced Monday morning that the woman, who gave an exclusive interview that night with CNN's Anderson Cooper about her experiences on the six-woman Zimmerman jury, had signed with a literary agent and was working on a book proposal about the trial. The agent was identified as Sharlene Martin, who has worked on such other post-trial tomes as O.J. Simpson's ""If I Did It"" and Mary Jo Buttafuoco's ""Getting It Through My Thick Skull."" Then came the Twitter backlash, led by 29-year-old New Yorker Genie Lauren, who goes by @MoreAndAgain on Twitter. Lauren saw the juror's interview on CNN and decided to take action. ""I was angry and I didn't think it was right that someone would make money off of this tragedy -- especially after they let Zimmerman go free,"" she told NewsOne. Lauren tracked down contact information for Martin, including her Twitter handle, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number, and posted it on the social network and on Storify, which displays social media posts in a blog-like stream. She then asked her followers to write Martin and urge her to drop B37 as a client. Next she launched a Change.org petition with the title, ""Sharlene Martin: Drop Juror B37 from Martin Literary Management,"" which quickly hit 1,346 signatures. Immediately, people began venting on Twitter and contacting Martin. In a matter of hours, Martin announced late Monday afternoon that she and the juror were no longer moving ahead with the book. In a statement released by Martin, the juror said, in part, ""I have realized the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury."" She elaborated in a statement Wednesday to CNN, saying, ""There was an agreement with a literary agent to explore the concept of a book which discussed the impact of sequestration on my perceptions of this serious case, while being compared to the perceptions of an attorney who was closely following the trial from outside the 'bubble.' ""The relationship with the agent ceased the moment I realized what had been occurring in the world during the weeks of my sequestration,"" she said. The quick death of the proposed book startled even those familiar with the power of well-orchestrated social media campaigns to sway public opinion and influence business decisions. It appears that Martin has since deleted her main Twitter account. And Monday, the number of Lauren's Twitter followers has jumped from 1,600 to more than 9,100. A thank-you tweet from The Roots' @questlove probably didn't hurt. ""I definitely believe in the power of Twitter. I'm in shock, really, about the whole thing,"" Lauren told ABC News. ""I'm glad that people didn't brush it off and just say, 'Oh, it's just Twitter, and ... nothing will come of this.' ""","A juror from the George Zimmerman trial announced Monday she would write a book .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The New York City Council on Thursday voted in favor of a bill that would extend term limits, allowing Mayor Michael Bloomberg to run for a third term. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to seek a third term in office. The vote was 29 in favor and 22 against. Bloomberg, who introduced the measure, welcomed the council's approval as the ""right choice."" ""Those of us who work on both sides of City Hall must now move forward with the important decisions that face us, particularly finding ways to soften the fallout from the economic downturn and balancing our budget as revenues decline,"" he said in a statement. ""We have a lot of work to do together to get New York through these tough times."" The bill allows most elected officials, including the mayor, to serve a third four-year term. Previously, New York mayors had been allowed to serve only two four-year terms, meaning Bloomberg would have been required to leave office at the end of next year. The vote followed two hours of lively debate in a packed room in City Hall, where Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum frequently admonished council members for going over their allotted time to speak. The chatter in the room prompted her to bang her gavel several times to call for order. The vote also came after the council nixed efforts to put the measure to a public referendum. Earlier, the council voted 22 in favor and 28, with one abstention, against an amendment to the bill that would have called for a voter referendum on the issue of term limits. ""New Yorkers went to the polls twice and said, 'We want term limits,' "" Tony Avella said, referring to a public vote in 1993 that imposed the two-term limit and another vote in 1996 that maintained it. ""For us to overturn that legislatively is a disgrace,"" he said. ""You should be all voted out of office for this."" Councilman Charles Barron agreed, reminding his colleagues of a proposal put forth to voters in in 2007 in Venezuela that would have allowed President Hugo Chavez to seek re-election indefinitely. The Venezuelan voters narrowly shot it down. ""Mayor Bloomberg, be like Hugo and let the people decide,"" he said. ""If we're talking about direct democracy, where the people rule, and a representative democracy, where those who represent the people come to vote -- if you do this, you're undermining the very people that vote you in to represent them,"" he said earlier Thursday, arguing in favor of the amendment to put the issue to a public referendum. Council Speaker Christine Quinn noted in her opening remarks that the vote was ""a very difficult vote in very difficult times."" ""Our city, already in recession, is headed for a long and deep downturn,"" she said. ""We will need to do more with less to keep our city moving in the right direction."" Earlier in the day, Quinn, an elected official, voiced her support for the bill. ""At a time like this, we need consistent leadership,"" she said. ""Voters should have the choice to continue their current leadership. They should have the right to vote for the current mayor or a new one."" Bloomberg, who was elected as a Republican months after the September 11 attacks, is credited with helping New York recover economically afterward. He was re-elected in 2005 and became an independent in 2007. The billionaire businessman announced in early October his intention to ask the City Council to amend the term limits so he could run for re-election. ""If the City Council should vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record of independent leadership and then decide if I've earned another term,"" Bloomberg said at City Hall. ""I care deeply about sustaining the progress we made and finishing the job the voters elected me to do."" On Wednesday, council members Bill de Blasio and Letitia James filed suit in a state court seeking to block the council's vote, arguing that it would be a conflict of interest for council members to vote on the bill. The city's Conflict of Interest Board determined last week that the council members' vote would not violate conflict of interest rules. De Blasio and James condemned the board's decision, saying it was ""so rushed, so results-oriented, so poorly reasoned and so damaging to the high ethical standards the charter's framers intended."" However, Judge Jacqueline Silbermann denied de Blasio and James' petition, and their lawyer, Randy Mastro, has said he will not appeal. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, 89 percent of New York voters said the issue of term limits should be decided by voters in a referendum, not by the City Council. The poll also found that 51 percent of voters opposed extending the term limits so Bloomberg could run again. Forty-five percent of voters were in favor of extending the term limits for their mayor. CNN's Elise Zeiger contributed to this report.","NEW: New York City Council votes 29 to 22 in favor of bill to extend term limits .

"(CNN) -- A West Virginia state judge is facing federal conspiracy charges for allegedly plotting to frame his secretary's husband in crimes, after the secretary broke off an affair with the judge. According to allegations in federal documents unsealed Thursday, the alleged five-year vendetta included plotting to plant drugs under the husband's car, recruiting a state trooper to arrest the man on bogus theft charges, and convincing a police officer to arrest him on groundless assault and battery charges, the documents say. Mingo County Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury, 57, was charged this week with two counts of conspiracy against rights, according to a federal indictment based on grand jury findings. ""Judge Thornsbury set off on a campaign to persecute his secretary's husband, his romantic rival. In the process he corrupted the system of Justice in Mingo County for his own nefarious purposes,"" U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said. Thornsbury's attorney, Stephen Jory, declined comment on the charges. He told CNN Friday that Thornsbury was arrested Thursday, but was released on personal recognizance bond the same day. Thornsbury spoke to CNN affiliate WCHS on Thursday, saying, ""The truth will be told and I will be acquitted...cause I'm not guilty."" Thornsbury, who had ""engaged in intimate physical contact"" with his secretary, according to the indictment, asked her to leave her husband in 2008. She refused. Michael Callahan, who represents the secretary and her husband, on Friday called the series of incidents that led up to the indictment a ""terrible abuse of a public office."" Callahan represented the husband in two criminal cases allegedly conjured up by Thornsbury. The charges were dismissed in both cases. ""I represent both RW and KW as they begin the process of putting their lives back together and seek their own justice. At this time, my clients are unwilling to make any public statements or do any interviews,"" Callahan said in a statement to CNN. Both the secretary and her husband were identified in the indictment only by their initials, K.W. and R.W., respectively. When the federal charges against Thornsbury were announced, West Virginia's highest court -- the Supreme Court of Appeals voted to suspend the judge without pay, and also voted to suspend his law license, according to an official press release from the high court. According to the indictment, the conspiracy charges stem from three alleged incidents: . --In 2008, Thornsbury allegedly tried to have a friend plant illegal drugs in a metal box under the husband's pickup truck. The friend agreed to do it, but never went through with it, according to the indictment. As part of the scheme, the judge had ""purposely cultivated a relationship"" with a state trooper apparently to have the trooper investigate after the drug-plant was done, according to the indictment. --Thornsbury ""repeatedly insisted"" the same state trooper get an arrest warrant for the husband, for supposedly stealing ""scrap mine bits"" from the coal company where he worked and selling those. The husband was subsequently arrested but charges were dismissed. Callahan, the attorney for the husband, said not only did the man have permission to take and sell the scrap bits that were ""refurbished"" then sold back to his company, the company approved of the practice. --Thornsbury allegedly seized upon an argument between the husband and some of his relatives to produce the arrest of the husband a month after the argument. A family dispute in 2012 led to one of the husband's relatives pulling a gun outside a convenience store, according to the indictment. The husband called police and even though investigating officers saw a store videotape of the incident and they concluded the relative was the aggressor, Thornsbury allegedly convinced another officer to arrest the husband weeks later on charges of assault and battery. Charges were later dismissed. Thornsbury has been Mingo County's sole circuit judge since 1997, according to a news release from the U.S. attorney's office. Thornsbury was first appointed to the state bench by the then-governor to fill a vacancy 1997, according to Jennifer Bundy, public information officer for the state Supreme Court of Appeals. Thornsbury subsequently was elected to serve as circuit judge. CNN's Jennifer Moore and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury is charged with two counts of conspiracy .

"Washington (CNN) -- Col. Denise Lind, the Army judge who found Pfc. Bradley Manning guilty on 20 of 22 counts in the largest classified leak case in U.S. history explained her thinking, calling Manning's conduct ""wrongful."" When Lind handed down her verdicts in July, Manning's lawyers asked her to issue her ""special findings"" for the guilty counts. That document was released Friday at Fort Meade, Maryland, where the sentencing phase of the trial continues. One of the questions that both sides debated at length during the court-martial was whether by leaking material to WikiLeaks, Manning also was providing it to the enemy. She ruled Manning had ""knowledge that intelligence published on the Internet was accessible to al Qaeda."" The judge went on to say that ""Manning's conduct was of a heedless nature that made it actually and imminently dangerous to others. His conduct was both wanton and reckless.""

"(CNN) -- The battle continues over which court should try the son of deceased Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. In the latest sign of a growing divide, the International Criminal Court on Friday rejected Libya's bid to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and asked the nation to hand him over. Libya has consistently challenged the ICC's demand to try Gadhafi, saying the Hague-based court does not have jurisdiction in the case. Gadhafi, who has been held in the Libyan city of Zintan since his capture in 2011, faces charges of crimes against humanity linked to the uprising that ousted his father about two years ago. The pre-trial chamber of the court questioned Libya's ability to prosecute the younger Gadhafi, saying the nation's judicial institutions are not well-established following the uprising. ""The Chamber found that multiple challenges remained and that Libya continued to face substantial difficulties in exercising its judicial powers fully across the entire territory,"" the court said in a statement. In addition to other challenges, the court said, securing legal representation for him in Libya will put the lawyers involved at risk and impede the proceedings. Last year, lawyers said Gadhafi was in isolation except for visits from officials. He also suffers dental pain, and Libyan authorities have given him nothing to remedy that, according to the lawyers. Libya and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. Saif Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, was seized by militants in November 2011 as he tried to flee the nation. A month before, his father was killed after rebel forces captured him near Sirte.","Libya has consistently said Gadhafi should be tried in the nation .

"(CNN) -- Pfc. Bradley Manning, who provided classified government documents to WikiLeaks detailing, among other things, America's undisclosed policies on torture, was found guilty of espionage on Tuesday. The verdict comes on the 235th anniversary of the passage of America's first whistle-blower protection law, approved by the Continental Congress after two Navy officers were arrested and harassed for having reported the torture of British prisoners. How have we gotten to the place where the revelation of torture is no longer laudable whistle-blowing, but now counts as espionage? The answer is that government has not yet come to terms with the persistence and transparency of the digital age. Information moves so fast and to so many places that controlling it is no longer an option. Every datapoint, whether a perverted tweet by an aspiring mayor or a classified video of Reuters news staffers being gunned down by an Apache helicopter, will somehow find the light of day. It's enough to make any administration tremble, but it's particularly traumatic for one with things to hide. That's why they tried to throw the book, and then some, at Manning. Prosecutors cast simple Internet commands known to any halfway literate Internet user (or anyone who used the Internet back in the early '90s) as clandestine codes used only by hackers to steal data. That Osama bin Laden could download these files off the WikiLeaks website (along with millions of other people) became justification for classifying the whistle-blowing as espionage, an act of war. And Manning is just one of a record seven Americans charged with violating the Espionage Act in a single administration. But prosecuting those whose keyboards or USB sticks may have been technically responsible for the revelations is futile. The more networked we become and the more data we collect, the more likely something will eventually find its way out. After all, a security culture based on surveillance and big data cuts both ways. Moreover, harsh reaction to digital whistle-blowers only increases the greater population's suspicions that more information is being hidden. In this one leaking incident, Manning exposed allegations of torture, undisclosed civilian death tolls in Afghanistan and Iraq, official orders not to investigate torture by nations holding our prisoners, accusations of the torture of Spanish prisoners at Guantanamo, the ""collateral murder"" video of Reuters journalists and Iraqi civilians as U.S. soldiers cheered, U.S. State Department support of corporations opposing Haitian minimum wage, training of Egyptian torturers by the FBI in Quantico, Virginia, U.S. authorized stealing of U.N. Secretary General's DNA -- the list goes on. These are not launch codes for nuclear strikes, operational secrets or even plans for future military missions. Rather, they are documentation of past activity and officially sanctioned military and state policy. These are not our secrets, but our ongoing actions and approaches. A thinking government--a virtuous one, if we can still use such a word--would treat this as a necessary intervention. Things have gone too far. But ours is a government in ""present shock"": an always-on, always-connected population puts the administration in a state of perpetual emergency interruption. It's not the phone call at 2 a.m. for which a president has to be prepared, but the tweet at 3, the Facebook update at 4, the YouTube video at 5, and on and on. In such a crisis-to-crisis landscape, there's no time to implement or even articulate a ""grand narrative."" A real-time, digital world offers no sense of mission or opportunity to tell a story. There's no Cold War to win. No moon shot to work toward. There are just emergent threats, one after the other after the other. Things just exist in the present, one tweet - or, actually, many tweets - at a time. This makes it exceedingly difficult to frame our policies and strategies with language and purpose. It's no longer a matter of walking the talk. Without the talk, there's only the walk. We have no way of judging the ethics and intentions of our government except by what it actually does. Combine this with the transparency that comes with digital technology and our leaders simply have no choice but to do the right thing. It takes more energy to prevent exposure than simply to behave consistently with the values we want to project. Just as corporations are learning that they can no longer maintain low prices through overseas slave labor without getting caught, a democratic government can no longer maintain security through torture and coercion without being exposed. Betraying our respect for human dignity only makes us less resolved as a people, and less trusted as a nation. We are just beginning to learn what makes a free people secure in a digital age. It really is different. The Cold War was an era of paper records, locked vaults and state secrets, for which a cloak-and-dagger mindset may have been appropriate. In a digital environment, our security comes not from our ability to keep our secrets but rather our ability to live our truth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Manning found guilty of espionage. Why is whistle-blowing punishable?

"(CNN) -- A group of uprooted Syrians grew angry when they sat down with John Kerry on Thursday. The world has forsaken their homeland, the six refugees told the U.S. secretary of state as he visited them at the U.N. refugee camp in Za'atri, Jordan. Kerry told them that he was sorry for their suffering and that he was there to listen to them. He asked them to speak their minds. They did.

They begged him to set up buffer zones and to stop the influx of weapons from Iran to aid al-Assad. Stop Hezbollah's troops from Lebanon from coming to fight side by side with his troops against the rebels, a woman pleaded. Kerry told her he was ""not happy"" either with what Iran and Hezbollah were doing. Lucy Liu: Syria's children deserve chance to be kids again . The Za'atri camp is home to roughly 120,000 refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria. Most of them are women and children.

The U.N. estimates that more than 93,000 people have died in Syria's civil war. After his visit, Kerry climbed into a helicopter and flew back to Amman, Jordan's capital. Before he left, one of the Syrian women told him that the refugees might not be there when he came back.

"(CNN) -- A white Mississippi man has been sentenced to life in prison for the 2011 murder of an African-American man, with the judge calling it an inexcusable, ""despicable"" crime. Deryl Dedmon pleaded guilty to murder and a hate-crime charge before a judge in Jackson on Wednesday afternoon, admitting to the June killing of James Craig Anderson. Hinds County Circuit Judge Jeff Weill sentenced him to two concurrent life terms, saying, ""This craven act isn't who we are."" ""Whatever excuse you offer, forget that. There is no excuse,"" Weill said. He added, ""The state of Mississippi condemns this despicable crime."" Dedmon, 19, told the judge that he was a ""changed man"" who had found religion since his arrest. ""I wish I could take it all back,"" he said, adding, ""I was young and dumb, ignorant and full of hatred. I chose to go down the wrong path."" Dedmon is also expected to plead guilty to still-undisclosed federal charges Thursday, three sources with knowledge of the case told CNN -- the first indication that a federal case was pending in Anderson's death. Officials would disclose no details, but Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith said he expected other charges -- and other arrests. ""This is just the beginning,"" Smith said. Anderson's killing prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson, a city of about 537,000 people. His sister, Barbara Anderson Young, said during Wednesday's hearing that her family was praying for ""racial conciliation."" ""These last months have been very difficult,"" Young said. ""We cried. We wept. We reminisced about our beloved brother, Craig, a loss I cannot even explain. Craig was a big-hearted person who loved his fellow man."" Anderson died after he was beaten and run over by a truck driven by Dedmon, according to police. Dedmon was part of a group of seven white youths from largely white Rankin County who decided to ""go f**k with some niggers,"" after a night of partying and drinking, law enforcement officials have said, quoting some of the suspects in the case. Smith has said the evidence indicated the suspects, who ranged in age from 17 to 19, ""went out with the intention to harm and, in this case, kill a black man."" According to investigators, they drove 16 miles in two vehicles from Rankin County to Jackson, where after exiting the highway, they found Anderson alone in a parking lot about 4 a.m. on June 26. The white men allegedly beat Anderson repeatedly, yelling racial epithets. After the beating, Dedmon drove his Ford F-250 truck over him, leaving him to die, according to what some of the teens cooperating with police have told authorities. Anderson's death drew national attention after CNN first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing, captured by a parking lot security camera in a Jackson suburb. A second man, John Aaron Rice, was initially charged with murder, but a judge reduced the charges to simple assault because Rice was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill Anderson. For months, lawyers had been working behind the scenes in Jackson, where Dedmon is being held, fighting over a change of venue in a possible trial. Smith had hoped to have a trial in Jackson, where the crime occurred and which is largely black. But defense attorneys wanted to move the trial to an area with a larger white population, the law enforcement officials said. Murder suspect carried 'backpack of hatred' Authorities believe Dedmon led and instigated the attack. On a sweltering Mississippi night in June, a gang of youths climbed into Dedmon's green truck and a white SUV and drove to the western edge of Jackson. They would have seen Anderson immediately as they exited the highway, officials said. He was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp. On the videotape obtained exclusively by CNN, the group pulls into the parking lot and stops where Anderson is standing, although he is just off camera and not visible. The young men can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson. Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson's beating took place, as the white youths yelled racial epithets, including ""white power."" Authorities allege Dedmon and many of the other teens pummeled Anderson repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground, although this is not visible on the tape. After the beating, some of the white youths left, and others got into the green Ford truck. At this moment, Anderson becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walked toward the truck. ""Defendant Dedmon drove the F-250 out of the parking lot and turned right onto Ellis Avenue,"" the lawsuit says. ""Just as Dedmon turned right, his headlights shone directly on Anderson, who, having been severely beaten, was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel's entrance. Dedmon accelerated, drove onto and over the street curb, and struck Anderson with the front of the F-250."" Shortly afterward, Dedmon allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing, according to statements some of the teens made to detectives. ""I ran that nigger over,"" he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the youths in the other car. ""He was not remorseful,"" Smith said. ""He was laughing, laughing about the killing."" But during a bail hearing last year, Dedmon's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the ""racial allegations."" The U.S. Justice Department had been looking into the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors. Federal investigators also have been digging for months into other possible crimes in the area committed by Dedmon and others that might show a pattern of racial violence. Anderson's family had asked state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty against Dedmon or any other youths who might be charged in the case, saying they oppose capital punishment in part because of their religious faith. The family also filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white youths who were present at the beating of Anderson.

"(CNN) -- Catastrophic flooding has prompted the evacuation of thousands upon thousands of people in Russia's Far East, a government ministry said Sunday, spurring hasty efforts to set up housing for the displaced. Russia's emergency ministry said Sunday that 18,000 people had been affected in three regions north of China not far from the Sea of Okhotsk. RIA Novosti, a state-run news agency, identified the affected regions as the Amur region, Khabarovsk Territory and the Jewish Autonomous Region. This report, citing an emergency ministry spokesperson, had an even larger number of people affected after heavy rains spurred the floods -- 32,000, of which 17,000 had been evacuated. The evacuees had lived in thousands of homes and apartment buildings across 121 impacted towns and villages, including some like Amurskaya Oblast, Khabarovskiy Krai and Evreiskaya Oblast that were particularly devastated. Authorities rushed to set up 166 temporary shelters and move in food, water and medical supplies, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said, according to RIA Novosti. That report, for instance, said that a plane had headed to the city of Blagoveshchensk with 53 tons of aid, including food, life jackets and boats. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting Saturday on the floods, after which he told local governors to be involved personally in the response. ""No one must be forgotten, and no one must be lost,"" he said, as reported by RIA Novosti. The amount of rain should decrease, and the pace water levels are rising should slow down, after Tuesday, said local enviromental official Vyacheslav Parshin. The water in that river -- which is expected to reach 7 meters (23 feet) by August 25 -- had never been so high, Parshin said according to RIA Novosti. The emergency ministry's report made no mention that anyone had been killed or injured as a result. But flooding in the expansive nation of Russia has proved deadly before. Last July, at least 141 people died after floods surged through southern Russia's Krasnodar region, state-run media reported, citing Russia's Interior Ministry.

"(CNN) -- An Iowa family that's been hoping for good news since two young cousins disappeared in July is now grappling with the worst. Hunters discovered two bodies in a wooded area Wednesday afternoon, Black Hawk County sheriff's Capt. Rick Abben said. He said the family of Lyric Cook, 10, and her cousin Elizabeth Collins, 8, had been notified even though the identification process was not complete. The bodies were taken to the state medical examiner's office in Ankeny, Iowa. ""Right now, it's looking like the outcome was not the one that we wanted,"" Abben said at a news conference in Evansdale, Iowa. While the medical examiner's office has not publicly confirmed the identity of the bodies, Elizabeth's mother, Heather Collins posted a message on Facebook late Wednesday night expressing gratitude for the prayers and outpouring of support amid the ""gut-wrenching news."" ""We know that they are up in heaven with our savior,"" she said on the Facebook page. ""Lord we know that you have them in your loving arms and we are so blessed."" The girls were last seen by their grandmother on July 13 when they left for a bike ride. The girls' bicycles and a purse were found near Meyers Lake hours after they were reported missing. A search of the 25-acre lake in July turned up nothing, and authorities said they believed the cousins were abducted. ""Cooperation with law enforcement is the key factor in discovering the whereabouts of Lyric and Elizabeth,"" FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault said in July. ""Unfortunately, in this case, law enforcement has not received total cooperation from all family and close friends,"" she said. Abben said the investigation is ongoing, and he thanked the public and the media for their assistance and support in the case. Read more on KCRG .

"(CNN) -- A suspected leader of Mexico's Gulf Cartel has been arrested near the U.S. border, a Mexican official said Sunday. Mario Armando Ramirez Trevino was captured Saturday in Reynosa, near Texas, said Eduardo Sanchez, the Mexican government's security spokesman. Ramirez, also known as X-20, was found with three guns, nine cell phones, and thousands of dollars and pesos in cash, the spokesman said. According to the U.S. State Department, Ramirez is a ranking member of the Gulf Cartel. It had offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The Gulf Cartel is one of Mexico's major drug-trafficking organizations. It's not as powerful as it once was. Last week, authorities said they captured two dozen suspected members of the cartel -- including two top lieutenants. In September, they arrested Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, the then-reputed boss of the powerful Gulf Cartel. Ramirez' arrest is the second capture of a major cartel leader in just a few weeks. Authorities nabbed Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, one of Mexico's most wanted drug lords, last month. His arrest was the most significant blow to drug trafficking in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. The Zetas started out as the enforcement arm of Mexico's Gulf Cartel, but later split off and formed their own drug-trafficking organization. CNN's Nick Parker, Catherine E. Shoichet and Ana Melgar contributed to this report.","Mario Armando Ramirez Trevino was captured near the U.S. border .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- There was a scene from the ""West Wing"" that speaks to what happens when a leader says enough is enough and is moved to action. President Bush should step up to deal with Hurricane Katrina's aftermath, says Roland S. Martin. The fictitious president, Josiah Bartlett, watches from a distance as the Teamsters union and UPS try to reach a bargaining agreement, but nothing is happening. As he attends a state dinner, he calls them all to the White House. When he walks in, the bickering begins. After a few seconds, he essentially says, ""Shut up. You guys have messed around, and I'm not going to have this nation paralyzed by your inaction. You¹re going to sit in this room until you figure it out. Now get to work. And when I return, I want to see an agreement."" Of course, this is easier said than done, and on television, everything gets solved during a one-hour show. But the basic premise remains the same: When the president of the United States wants to step in and make something happen, he will. He is the most powerful person on the planet, so what's the problem with the Katrina recovery effort? Bush said he was going to appoint a czar over the Gulf Coast, and he often refers to Don Powell as being that guy, but he doesn't have the power. In fact, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, says he is having to use persuasive powers -- as opposed to having the statutory power -- to make it a reality. You can't cut through red tape if you don't have a pair of scissors to do it. So how do we make it happen? President Bush needs to stop the back and forth taking place and order New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, certain members of Congress, Powell, and other leaders to come to Camp David, sit down, come up with a workable plan, and get it going. He should say, ""I don't care how long you guys sit in this room. I don't care how long it takes. But you are going to devise a clear and concise plan, and once you¹re done, we are going to go to the Rose Garden, hold a news conference for the rest of the world to hear it and then get to work."" If there are onerous rules that are getting in the way of progress, give Powell the power to change them. If contractors are dragging their feet and doing shoddy work, fire them. Stick everyone responsible for recovery in one building and say this is the nerve center and all operations are being handled here. It's pathetic being down here and listening to the finger-pointing, backstabbing, accusations of ineptness on the part of the city, state and federal government. All I keep hearing is ""We need a plan, we need a plan."" Ask the mayor's office and they will say, ""We've got a plan."" Call the governor's office and they will tell you there is a plan. But when you ask to see it, no one seems to be able to come up with it. As a result, we get spending that is out of control; waste taking place at all levels; money sent to the state that hasn't been spent; and the people who need the help, those who lost everything, ­sit in limbo. Mr. President, you've been accused of being John Wayne. Well, act the part. Pull a John Wayne and save the day. The only thing that is going to move this ball along is forceful leadership. And the only person who can do it is President Bush. No more paralysis by analysis. The money to build will come from the federal government. The head of the federal government is the president. If the president truly cared, and wanted to end the bickering and inaction, he could make this happen. People are desperately waiting for someone, ­anyone, ­to step up. President Bush, you¹re the commander in chief. Command the players to get to work. Today. Roland S. Martin is a nationally award-winning, multifaceted journalist and CNN contributor.

"Miami (CNN) -- It sounded like a good deal: Get a Cuban birth certificate and stay in the United States, worry-free. But federal authorities say the birth certificates weren't legitimate, and the undocumented immigrants trying to get them weren't Cuban. Now a federal judge in Florida has sentenced several people for conspiring to commit immigration fraud. The defendants, authorities say, made more than half a million dollars selling forged Cuban birth certificates to undocumented immigrants and helping them fill out fraudulent U.S. immigration forms. Their aim, investigators said, was to exploit a U.S. law that allows Cuban immigrants to apply for permanent residence if they've been in the United States for more than a year. Authorities arrested Nelson Daniel Silvestri Soutto, Laura Maria Ponce Santos, Amelia Osorio and Fidel Morejon Vega last year. Court documents show that all four have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit immigration fraud. New immigration rules help undocumented families . Court documents provide details about a type of scam that's becoming increasingly common, immigration lawyers say. In one conversation with a confidential informant recorded by investigators, Morejon demanded thousands of dollars in payment for Cuban birth certificates and provided advice about how to answer questions from immigration authorities who might ask why he has a Mexican accent. ""'Uh, because I work with a lot of Mexicans and I caught it (the accent) ...'"" period,"" Morejon said, according to a transcript of the conversation filed in federal court. ""You are Cuban ... from today on ... 3:25 in the afternoon you are entering the United States and you are Cuban."" Morejon advised the informant and an undercover officer not to make conversation with officials, and to tell them they arrived ""in a raft,"" according to the transcript. Investigators describe Morejon as the scheme's ringleader, accusing him of recruiting the others and paying them referral fees for each undocumented immigrant who purchased his services. Opinion: Solve immigration without a quick path to citizenship . He ""met with numerous illegal aliens and told them that he could assist them in obtaining their residency in the United States by pretending to be Cuban,"" according to a court document filed along with Morejon's guilty plea agreement last year. ""To effectuate the fraud, Morejon posed as an immigration officer to impress the illegal aliens (and) also threatened some of the illegal aliens with deportation,"" the document said. The day authorities arrested him, they found blank Cuban birth certificates and altered naturalization certificates in his Florida home, federal prosecutors said in a memo filed this month. In addition to selling fake Cuban birth certificates, Morejon also sold fraudulent presidential pardons, prosecutors said. Morejon, of Kissimmee, Florida, is scheduled to be sentenced later this month. Prosecutors have asked the judge to sentence him to more than three years in prison. ""The full extent of Morejon's fraud remains unknown as his former customers continue to be identified by the government,"" prosecutors said. ""The one conclusion that must be drawn from all the facts is that Morejon devoted his life, over a period of more than three and a half years, to extracting as much money as possible from his customers and obtaining that money by whatever means necessary."" U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga sentenced Ponce earlier this month to six months in prison, two years on parole and nine months under house arrest. Osorio was sentenced Thursday to four months in prison, two years of parole and 11 months under house arrest. And Silvestri was sentenced to a year in prison, three years on parole and nine months under house arrest. Morejon pleaded guilty ""and acknowledged he was the organizer,"" said Hugo Rodriguez, an attorney representing Morejon. That means he'll likely receive a higher sentence, Rodriguez said. Attorney Richard Serafini, who represents Osorio, declined to comment but referred to a memo he filed in court earlier this month, arguing for a lower sentence. The memo argues that Osorio, 61, paid Morejon thousands of dollars for a fraudulent presidential pardon for her son, who had been convicted of a federal drug offense. She became involved in the conspiracy ""through her efforts to help her son"" and her criminal conduct was an ""extreme aberration,"" Serafini wrote. ""Her background is one of hard work, dedication to her family and, until this episode, law-abiding,"" the memo said. Attorneys for Ponce and Silvestri did not respond to requests for comment. This type of scam has been happening in Florida for years but appears to be on the rise, immigration attorney Wilfredo Allen said. There are consequences beyond this particular case, according to Maite Hoyos, an immigration attorney in Miami. More and more, she said, authorities are asking her Cuban clients to prove the validity of their birth certificates -- something, she says, that suggests that this type of fraud is on investigators' radar.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek leftist leader Alexis Tsipras on Tuesday laid out the radical agenda he hopes to pursue if he becomes prime minister, including the cancellation of severe budget-cutting measures forced on the country by international lenders. Laws that cut pensions and salaries and those that ""cancel basic workers' rights"" must be annulled, Tsipras said as he started efforts to form a governing coalition in the wake of Sunday's parliamentary elections. He also called for state control of the banks, which ""remain in the hands of the managers who bankrupted the system,"" he said. The Greek people voted clearly to reject the austerity demanded by international lenders, said Tsipras, leader of the Syriza Party. The two parties that made the agreement with international lenders ""don't have a majority any more to vote for the plundering of the Greek people,"" Tsipras told lawmakers. He said he was planning to meet the leaders of those parties Wednesday but called on Evangelos Venizelos of PASOK and Antonis Samaras of New Democracy to renounce publicly the deal they made with international lenders before then. Samaras said what Tsipras was proposing would result in Greece exiting the eurozone, and that the Syriza leader was doing everything possible to ensure no government would be formed. Venizelos said PASOK would not form a coalition with Syriza, as the party would only participate in a coalition government that would secure Greece's position in the eurozone. Greek media reported that Tsipras was preparing to send a letter to the European Union, but it was not immediately known what he planned to say. Tsipras met Greek President Karolos Papoulias earlier Tuesday to get instructions to try to cobble together a government in the wake of elections that left the country's political system in chaos. Syriza will have three days to form a government. Communist Party leader Aleka Papariga spoke with Tsipras by phone but will not meet him, Syriza said. Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Left, which splintered from Syriza in 2010, told Tsipras that when they met Tuesday Syriza needed the support of more than just the left, Tsipras' bloc said. The Ecologist Greens also rejected Syriza's approach for support Tuesday, saying a road map to exit the crisis was needed. Syriza came in second in the elections, in which seven parties got seats in parliament and no party captured more than 19% of the vote. The Greek stock market dropped about 5% in early trading before recovering somewhat Tuesday. The market had fallen more than 6% Monday. The Greek elections came the same day that French voters kicked out President Nicolas Sarkozy in favor of Socialist FranÃ§ois Hollande, who spoke out against austerity in his victory speech Sunday. The failure of Greece's main center-right party to form a coalition government Monday added yet more uncertainty to the debt-ridden country's political situation. New Democracy leader Samaras said he did ""everything possible"" to form a coalition, but none of the parties agreed to join with his party, which won first crack at forming a government after finishing first in Sunday's parliamentary elections. Politicians have until May 17 to come up with a new working alliance or, if they cannot, set a date for another round of elections. Syriza more than tripled its parliamentary representation to 51 seats out of 300 in the balloting. Tsipras left little doubt Sunday about what direction his party would take in a new government. ""European leadership and especially (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat,"" Tsipras said. He called the election results ""a message of a peaceful revolution."" The election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures imposed in Greece. A European Commission spokeswoman said Monday that Greece needs time to work through its political process but reminded the country's leaders that they would be expected to abide by terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown. ""The commission hopes and expects that the future government of Greece will respect the engagements that Greece has entered into,"" spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters. New Democracy finished first in Sunday's voting but ended up with only 108 seats in Greece's 300-seat parliament. Voters also delivered a rebuke to PASOK -- New Democracy's socialist partner in the outgoing coalition government -- stripping the party of 119 seats. Together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue the coalition, requiring formation of a new government. Last year, Greece's debt threatened to force it to drop Europe's common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits -- and significant public outcry. The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work. Youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work. For two years, the country's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth â‚¬130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy. The tribulations of New Democracy and PASOK were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also-rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago, propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures. CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","NEW: The leader of the socialist PASOK party says it won't support Syriza .

"(CNN) -- By the time police officers reached the swimmer floating off a New Zealand beach, it was already too late: a large shark was biting the lifeless body. The attack took place off a popular beach west of Auckland on Wednesday afternoon, police said, as people gathered there to enjoy the summer sunshine. The victim was a man in his 40s. He was swimming 200 meters (220 yards) offshore near Muriwai Beach, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from central Auckland when the 12-to-14-foot shark struck. ""We saw him rolling around, there was blood everywhere on the water,"" Pio Mose, who was fishing nearby, told local broadcaster 3 News. Mose said he believed at least two other sharks had joined in the frenzy around the body after a few minutes. The shark that attacked the swimmer was a great white, according to Russell Clark, a paramedic from the Westpac Rescue Helicopter service, which responded to the emergency at the beach. Police officers and life guards on the scene went out in inflatable boats. When they fired at the shark they saw by the body, it ""rolled over and disappeared,"" said Inspector Shawn Rutene. Following the death, police closed the beach and several others nearby. Auckland Council said it expected the area to remain closed for the next few days. Shark attacks kill about 25 people a year worldwide, according to the New Zealand Department of Conservation. However, fatal attacks in the country's beaches have been rare. There have been fewer than 20 shark attack deaths in more than 175 years in New Zealand, the agency said. Twitter users expressed their condolences to the victim's family. Others worried about the risk of more attacks. ""Shark attack at Muriwai!!"" exclaimed a user named Aaron Jeavons. ""Won't be swimming there again!""

"London (CNN) -- During the 1970s, Formula One really was car crash telly. Drivers were routinely maimed or killed as safety took a back seat. The wacky races run during that era provided the sport with some of its most celebrated and reviled moments which are now the subject of two feature-length films released this autumn. 'Rush' Directed by Oscar-winning director Ron Howard, ""Rush"" tells the true story of the battle between James Hunt and Austria's Niki Lauda for the 1976 F1 World Championship. The pair were polar opposites. Hunt, played by Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, was a swashbuckling, hedonistic Brit. Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), on the other hand, was a deeply fastidious character known as ""The Computer."" A glorious battle of egos ensues amid a season marked by arguments over car and fuel regulations off the track and near-tragedy on it when Lauda spectacularly crashes out of the German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring. Trapped inside the burning wreck of his Ferrari, Lauda is eventually pulled free by fellow drivers but not before enduring terrible burns to his face and lung damage. Not only does Lauda beat the odds -- at one point a priest is called to administer the last rites -- he also defies all logic, returning to race 43 days later at Monza where he finishes fourth in the Italian Grand Prix. ""I was happy to stay alive. Normally you get killed in this kind of accident,"" Lauda told CNN at the world premiere in London earlier this month. ""It was clear that the challenge now was to say: Can you ever come back, and how much time does it take? This was really my challenge. It was not Hunt at the time. So I fought my way back five weeks later in Monza."" Lauda's miraculous return makes for a thrilling climax to the season which, naturally, ends on a controversial note at a rain-lashed Fuji Speedway in Japan. ""Both of these guys were so truthful and so competitive and there's not a hypocritical bone in either of their bodies,"" director, Ron Howard told CNN. ""They just did things their way. They would have scars of some of those decisions, but they also got to own their own triumphs and you have to admire that. To me, that's the nobility of the story."" ""Rush"" goes on release in the U.S. on September 20. '1' Serious injuries and fatalities are thankfully rare in F1 these days, but it wasn't so long ago that the sport would consider itself very lucky to get through a season without someone being killed. ""1,"" a new 90-minute documentary narrated by Michael Fassbender, tells the story of the fight to improve safety told by the men who survived the sport's most deadly era. ""The racetracks hadn't changed, the medical facilities hadn't changed and suddenly the cars were going almost twice as fast,"" explains three-time world champion Jackie Stewart during the film. Director Paul Crowder, vividly recalls his teenage self watching F1 during the 1970s in an almost permanent state of disbelief. ""The thing I always remember about it was thinking: another one has died. It's crazy. I couldn't quite fathom (it). It happened so consistently."" Crowder speaks to the survivors -- Stewart, Jody Scheckter, Emerson Fittipaldi and others -- who share stories of camaraderie and their battles with the sport's governing body, the FIA, to take safety more seriously. ""All the drivers were trying, but the biggest key was the FIA. Basically their attitude was: 'If you think it's dangerous, slow down,'"" Crowder says. ""I think they thought we were gladiators,"" Stewart says. ""They were blind to the reality. They didn't know those drivers. They didn't know the driver's wives, fathers and mothers."" Improvements eventually came, but it wasn't until the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola in 1994 that safety regulations started to be transformed, says Crowder. ""That was the point at which they had the technology and the will, and they had Max Mosley running the FIA."" Today, whatever the sport may have lost in terms of raw excitement, it has gained the total acceptance that the preservation of human life comes first. ""Whatever is happening to a car, there should be no reason to die in a car,"" seven-time Michael Schumacher tells Crowder.

'Senna' This moving portrait of the late Brazilian resonated with both critics and moviegoers becoming an instant classic when it was released in 2010. Directed by Asif Kapadia, ""Senna"" tells the story of Brazil's three-time world champion from his karting days in the late 1970s to his tragic death, aged 34, at Imola in May 1994. Senna was compassionate and charismatic off the track and fearless, sometimes reckless, on it. The combination made him a global superstar that transcended the sport. Rare archive footage and interviews with a string of ex-drivers, officials and journalists combine to create a searing portrait of arguably the greatest driver to ever race an F1 car.

American actor James Garner heads an international cast which includes British world champion Graham Hill and cameos by many of his famous racing contemporaries.

"Washington (CNN) -- Three more Secret Service employees have ""chosen to resign"" in the wake of a prostitution scandal that emerged last week, the agency said in a news release Friday. Six Secret Service members now have left their jobs in the wake of the incident in Cartagena, Colombia, which came while they were on a security detail in advance of President Barack Obama's trip there for the Summit of the Americas. The agency also announced Friday that a 12th Secret Service ""employee has been implicated,"" having previously said 11 were under investigation. One employee ""has been cleared of serious misconduct, but will face administrative action,"" the Secret Service said. Five employees are on administrative leave and have had their security clearances temporarily revoked. In addition, the U.S. military is investigating 11 of its own troops for possible heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes. A source close to the investigation said Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan -- who briefed Obama on the investigation Friday, according to White House officials -- has ordered a ""comprehensive"" investigation of everything that happened during the trip. That includes interviews with every Secret Service member on site, hotel staff and alleged prostitutes, the source said. In addition, the source confirmed that Secret Service agents were staying at a second hotel on the trip -- identified as a Hilton in Cartagena -- which presumably will be included in the expanded probe. The controversy has embarrassed the nearly 150-year-old agency that protects the president and other top officials and investigates criminal activity. It also raised questions about a possible security breach immediately preceding Obama's visit, though House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Peter King has said that ""from everything we know, nothing was compromised."" Secret Service pushing out three members amid Colombia scandal . Two of the Secret Service employees whose departures were previously announced -- identified as David Chaney and Greg Stokes, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend -- were supervisors. In a photo posted on his public Facebook page in January 2009, Chaney is seen standing behind Sarah Palin, wearing dark glasses and what appears be a wedding ring. Under the photo, Chaney posted a comment that said, ""I was really checking her out, if you know what I mean?"" That remark drew a strong response Thursday night from Palin, who was a vice presidential candidate when the photo was taken. ""This agent who was kind of ridiculous there in posting pictures and comments about checking someone out,"" Palin said on Fox News. ""Check this out, bodyguard. You're fired! And I hope his wife sends him to the doghouse."" Chaney, a son of a Secret Service agent, has been employed with the agency since 1987, according to his posting on Reunion.com. The posting notes that he is married, has an adopted son and his assignments included a stint protecting former Vice President Dick Cheney. Questions raised about macho culture, women agents . Stokes supervised the canine training unit at the Secret Service's James J. Rowley Training Center outside Washington, according to PetLife Radio and a career development posting on the University of Maryland's website. Attorney Lawrence Berger -- general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents Secret Service agents and others -- said he is not representing all of the agents involved in the Colombia story, but he does have several other clients in the group in addition to Chaney and Stokes. He would not comment on specifics of the investigation, but complained about leaks that publicly identified Chaney and Stokes and gave details of what allegedly happened in Colombia. ""The concern I have is about illegal leaks coming from apparently rogue elements within the Secret Service of privacy-protected information,"" Berger said. ""It is distorting the review of what happened."" All the employees are accused of bringing prostitutes to Cartagena's Hotel El Caribe ahead of last week's visit by Obama. They'd arrived earlier that morning as a part of the ""jump team"" that flies in on military transport planes with vehicles in the president's motorcade, said Townsend. According to sources, the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at the hotel, where Secret Service members apparently stayed, flashing their local ID cards. One of these women allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night, which brought the entire incident to light and sparked controversy in the United States and Colombia. Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe told CNN on Thursday that the incident was due entirely to ""a lack of ethics (on the part of) the Secret Service of the United States."" Members of the U.S. Congress offered similarly biting remarks. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the allegations ""disgusting,"" while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid described the agents' alleged actions as ""either really stupid or a total lack of common sense."" The U.S. military is investigating six members of its elite Army Special Forces, or Green Berets, officials said. The Green Berets' failure to make curfew the night of the incident involving the Secret Service agents led the military to start its investigation, a U.S. official told CNN. All the military personnel are being investigated for heavy drinking and use of prostitutes while in Colombia as part of the support team for Obama's visit, the official said. They are not likely to redeploy until the matter is resolved, other military officials said. The military investigation could end with no action, administrative action such as a letter of reprimand or a recommendation to proceed with criminal charges, officials said. While soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in Colombia, military law bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct ""prejudicial to good order and discipline."" It is also considered a breach of the Secret Service's conduct code, government sources said. CNN's Carol Cratty, Briana Keilar, Brian Todd, Bob Kovach, John King, Barbara Starr, Deirdre Walsh, Rafael Romo, Jessica Yellin and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Three more Secret Service employees have ""chosen to resign,"" the agency says .

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's octogenarian Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala resigned Thursday, ending two months of political deadlock following elections for a constituent assembly in April. Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has resigned after two years in the job. ""I would like to announce my resignation from the post of prime minister in this constituent assembly,"" Koirala, 84, told the 601-member assembly. Nepal's former rebels, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which became the largest party but fell short of a majority in the April elections, is now expected to form the new government. ""Koirala's resignation today is just a political statement which means that the government has now become a caretaker one,"" said Bhim Rawal of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) . ""He will now have to formally hand in his resignation to the president once one is elected."" ""Only after a president is elected, will a new government be formed,"" said Rawal. Announcing his resignation Koirala said: ""You political parties should not forget the path of unity and cooperation, even if it is minus Girija Prasad Koirala."" Nepal became a republic last month ending a 239-year-old monarchy but is still to get its first president. Koirala's resignation Thursday follows a 22-point agreement Wednesday among Nepal's ruling seven-party coalition to elect a president and prime minister through a simple majority of the constituent assembly. April's elections, the declaration of a republic and the drafting of a new constitution, the main task of the constituent assembly, are parts of a peace process following 10 years of fighting between the Maoists and the state which ended in November 2006 with a peace deal.","Girija Prasad Koirala announces his resignation as Nepal's prime minister .

"(CNN) -- Cape Verde has seen its hopes of qualifying for a first football World Cup dashed after the sport's global governing body FIFA punished the African country for fielding a suspended player. FIFA ruled on Thursday that Cape Verde's Fernando Varela had played in a qualifying match while serving a suspension for unsporting conduct. Varela played in a match against Tunisia in September which Cape Verde won 2-0. The result has now been officially reclassified as a 3-0 win for Tunisia. The decision means Tunisia have finished above Cape Verde in African qualifying Group B and will take its place in the forthcoming playoff matches to decide which five teams from the continent will qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. ""By means of a telephone conference, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee has today taken a decision to sanction the Cape Verdean Football Association (FCF) for fielding an ineligible player,"" read a FIFA statement. ""The match has been declared to be forfeited and awarded 3-0 in favor of Tunisia, meaning that the Cape Verde Islands will not progress to round three of the FIFA World Cup African zone qualifiers having dropped to second place in Group B with nine points while Tunisia finish first with 14 points and will now advance."" The decision is a major blow for Cape Verde, which has only ever played in one major international tournament. The Blue Sharks qualified for this year's Africa Cup of Nations, reaching the quarterfinals in South Africa before losing to Ghana.","Cape Verde will not play in the football World Cup following a FIFA sanction .

"(CNN) -- Singer-actress Pia Zadora landed in jail after she allegedly fought with her teenage son when he wouldn't go to bed early Saturday, police said. Zadora, 61, was charged with domestic violence battery and coercion for allegedly scratching 16-year-old Jordan's ear as she tried to take his cell phone when he dialed 911, according to a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police report. Jordon told police his mother and her husband -- Las Vegas Police Det. Michael Jeffries -- were drinking alcohol in their home before the incident. The trouble began around 11 p.m. when his mother said she was tired and she ordered him to bed, the police report said. ""Jordan said he told his mom he wanted to stay outside and talk because it was a weekend night,"" the report said. Zadora became ""upset and angry"" and ""got the hose and started squirting everyone, insisting that Jordan go to bed and Mike Jr. leave."" She then scratched her husband's face and was ""punching and scratching"" her 32-year-old stepson, the report said. Several hours later -- at 4:30 a.m. -- the mother and son ""wrestled"" over Jordan's cell phone, it said. ""Pia then grabbed him from behind around his head, grabbing his eyes and face, leaving a scratch on his left ear,"" the report said. ""Jordan got away and Pia came up and again grabbed him from behind encircling his neck in the process."" When police arrived, they were not allowed inside the home, but they realized a police officer -- Jeffries -- lived there, the report said. Two officers found an unlocked door in the rear and entered, the report said. ""Metro Police. Come out with your hand up,"" an officer announced. ""What are you doing in my house?"" an unknown male voice replied. ""I then stated that he knew why we were there and to come out so we could talk,"" the reporting officer wrote. ""Why don't you f--king come back here and get me!"" the unknown male shouted, the report said. The police officers retreated from inside the home and waited for SWAT officers to surround the house, the report said. Zadora later told police she did not come out because she thought her husband, a detective ""would take care of it."" After a couple of hours of sleep -- with the SWAT officers still surrounding her house -- she said she called 911 and operators told her to go outside, which she did. Zadora's fame is partially based on her involvement in a Hollywood awards scandal in 1982. When the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave her the Golden Globe best female newcomer award, it triggered allegations that her wealthy then-husband had influenced the selection by entertaining voters at his casino. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","The trouble began when Zadora said she was tired and ordered her son to bed, police say .

"(CNN) -- The premise seemed easy enough. Let's get six kids poised to enter kindergarten together to ask what they expect from their ""big"" school, which is how my littlest one referred to kindergarten before she started. That's right. I have a child who entered kindergarten last year and another who started the year before, which means I should know you have to be prepared for anything with a group of six rambunctious little ones. But that was not top of mind. Neither was this thought: What was I actually thinking trying to interview kids? I had those cute AT&T commercials in my head. You've surely seen them. A guy sitting around with a small group of precocious kids who say the darndest things, like the one where the adorable girl says she wants to turn her brother into a puppy so she can take him to school and say, ""Hey everybody here's my puppy brother."" Priceless. I thought, let's do our own version! What's that expression about best laid plans? I quickly learned I did a better job questioning presidents during my White House days. Always wanting to be prepared, I had questions ready: ""What are you excited about kindergarten?"" ""Who's in charge at kindergarten?"" ""What do you hope to do in kindergarten?"" But the kids, five of whom attended Morningside Montessori School in Manhattan, the same nursery school as my daughters, had other ideas. And so, I quickly transitioned from reporter to mom and thought, ""Let's play 'Simon Says.' "" Everything seemed to be going along swimmingly until one of the children turned my idea on its head, as you'll see in the video above. Think of it as an orchestrated coup right there in my living room. Opinion: My view: Kindergarten redshirting different for each child . How could I possibly expect kids to sit around talking with me when there were Legos in the playroom and a ""Jake and the Neverland Pirate"" ship and a soccer game? You get the idea! The interview wasn't a total disaster. We did squeak out a few nuggets on what they hope to do in kindergarten (learn to read and, oh, ride a rainbow pony!), who's in charge in kindergarten (they thought that was the most obvious question of them all!) and how they simply don't know -- just yet -- what they want to be when they grow up. After all, they have plenty of time. What did I learn? Next time, never let the kids take over ""Simon Says."" Follow Kelly Wallace on Twitter and like CNN Living on Facebook.

"(CNN) -- FIFA's decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has stirred plenty of simmering tensions in football's global community -- but is it about to boil over into costly demands for compensation? On Tuesday, football's world governing body FIFA insisted it will not be liable for compensation if the 2022 World Cup is staged in winter rather than summer. FIFA is considering rescheduling the World Cup because of concerns over high temperatures in host nation Qatar, where the heat can reach 122 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer months. And Australian football chiefs argue that if the competition is moved then FIFA should offer compensation to those nations affected by a major rescheduling of global football's calendar. But a FIFA spokesperson told CNN: ""As part of the bidding documents all bidders, including the FA Australia, accepted that the final decision regarding the format and dates of the staging of the FIFA World Cup and FIFA though initially expected to be in June/July, remains subject to the final decision of the FIFA Organising Committee. ""There is no ground for any speculations."" FIFA will discuss the proposal to move the tournament to a cooler winter date at a meeting in Zurich next month. On Tuesday Football Federation of Australia went public over its view that explained in a statement that it wants FIFA's Executive Committee to consider: ""An in-principle decision that just and fair compensation should be paid to those nations that invested many millions, and national prestige, in bidding for a summer event. ""If there is consensus within the Ex-Co that a change in date should be considered, then a transparent process should be established to examine the scheduling implications for all leagues and a method developed for agreeing appropriate compensation for those affected."" Qatar beat bids from Australia, South Korea, the U.S. and Japan to win the right to stage the 2022 World Cup. FIFA president Sepp Blatter recently expressed fears that the heat in a Qatari summer would have detrimental health effects on players and quality of football at the tournament. He said: ""You can cool down the stadiums but you can't cool down the whole country and you can't simply cool down the ambiance of a World Cup."" Blatter's Executive Committee could make a decision on 3 October to move the World Cup. Frank Lowry, chairman of Australia's Football Federation, said he had written to Mr Blatter to explain why he is against a quick decision and why he feels Australia has a case for complaint and compensation. ""Australia invested heavily in the World Cup process and the entire nation was behind the bid,"" he said. ""Since December 2010 Australia has been careful not to let its misgivings about the process be interpreted as sour grapes. ""But now, with increasing speculation about a change that will impact on us as one of the bidding nations, and because our competition will be affected, we have made our position public. ""Our season takes place during the Australian summer to avoid a clash with other local football codes. ""If the World Cup were to be staged in the middle of our A-League season it would impact on our competition, not just for 2022, but for the seasons leading up to and beyond that date."" Last month Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said FIFA should consider switching the 2022 World Cup from Qatar rather than staging the event in winter. Qatar's World Cup team was not immediately available for comment. The bid team is understood to be happy to host the tournament whenever the FIFA requires regardless of the ramifications for others.","FIFA says it is not liable for compensation if the 2022 World Cup is staged in winter .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- The death toll from an explosion Monday at an ammunition factory in southern Yemen has risen to 150, a government official and medical source said Tuesday. Eighty-five people were injured in the blast in Abyan Province, some critically, said the official, who asked not to be named out of fears for his safety. Eyewitnesses reported that about half of those killed were women and children. Security officials said Monday that most of the dead and injured were locals who had been ransacking the factory after it was taken over by militants Sunday. The provincial governor on Tuesday blamed al Qaeda for the explosion, the nation's official news agency, Saba, reported. At a meeting, Gov. Saleh al-Zawari ""stressed the importance of cohesion and solidarity to stand together against these criminal and terrorist elements who try to hit the social peace in the governorate,"" Saba said. The explosion took place after months of demonstrations targeting Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, as well as a weekend of clashes between government forces and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. People on both sides were killed, security forces said. Protests were taking place Tuesday in 11 locations throughout the country, with the largest crowds estimated in Taiz province, followed by the capital, Sanaa, witnesses said. Smaller crowds were seen in the provinces of Aden, Hodieda, Abyan, Shabwa, Mahweet, Baitha, Dhamar, Lahj and Hajjah, according to witnesses. ""We will continue for days, weeks and even months if we have to,"" said Adel Qubati, a youth activist in Taiz. ""President Saleh's tricks will only buy him more time, and we will assure that he leaves office in disgrace."" Another young activist, Nofel Abdul Moqni, said, ""Every day we stay under the sun protesting makes us stronger."" Saleh has been fighting to hold onto power, arguing that he is best equipped to lead the fight against Islamists. Yemen has been facing protests from people citing government corruption, a lack of political freedom, and high unemployment. Calls for Saleh's ouster have increased in recent weeks following revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia. Saleh has ruled since 1978. Saleh said Sunday he will not offer any more concessions, and he described the opposition as an alliance against the country's majority, according to Saba. Opposition leaders rejected the president's comments. The country has been wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives, and a looming shortage of water. Saleh has been a staunch U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The president has said he accepts opposition demands for constitutional reforms and holding parliamentary elections by the end of the year. Saleh has also promised not to run for president in the next round of elections. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","NEW: The provincial governor blames al Qaeda for the blast .

"(CNN) -- High temperatures forced Amtrak to keep the brake on rail speed in the Northeast on Friday, while a cold front bearing thunderstorms hinted at some relief from the Great Lakes to northern New England. Amtrak said the speed restrictions were necessary along rail lines between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, because of extreme heat that can distort tracks. Highs in the high 90s were forecast for Philadelphia on Friday. The National Weather Service said there was a slight risk of severe thunderstorms, damaging winds and hail from northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin east to Maine. The storms should help break the grip of the humid heat wave that has smothered the northeast quarter of the nation, forecasters say. The relief will arrive in the Upper Midwest late Friday before cooling off the Northeast on Saturday night, the National Weather Service said. People should avoid celebrating outdoors, as thunderstorms are predicted to electrify the ground with lightning in many areas. Michigan could see large hail, the weather service said. High gusts may blow loose objects around. Tornadoes are also possible. But the sticky heat will not retreat without a fight. It was steam cooking the Midwest during the day Friday and will do the same to the mid- to north Atlantic until late Saturday. Temperatures above 90 degrees will combine with roughly 100% humidity to put heat indexes, which measure how hot it feels, near 100. The index is likely to hit 105 in the heavy populated corridor from Washington to the northern exurbs of New York City and over a broad swath around Detroit, the weather service warns. In New York, utility company Con Edison urged customers to conserve energy as electric use hit an all-time high in its service area, a peak of 13,214 megawatts at 2 p.m. Friday. Health dangers . Extreme heat causes more deaths than all other extreme weather conditions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. It killed more than 8,000 people between 1979 and 2003, more than ""hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes combined."" From 1999 to 2009, there was an annual average of 658 heat-related deaths in the country, the CDC says. At least six people have died this summer in the Northeast, health officials in Maryland and New York state reported. This week, an elderly man who wandered away from his home in Kentucky died of heat exhaustion, a local coroner said. The hot weather is of particular concern for children, the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions, as air quality plummets while ozone levels soar. Officials advise everyone to stay cool and drink plenty of water. Southwestern grill . As the high-pressure area that caused the heat relinquishes in the Northeast, a new one will form in the Southwest. It will bring ""record heat"" to western Nevada, the weather service predicts, with temperatures topping 100 degrees in some places every day for nearly a week. Fire precautions are in place there because of a long-standing drought and dry heat.","Amtrak keeps some speed restrictions as high heat threatens to warp tracks .

"(CNN) -- A rare brain-eating amoeba that killed a 4-year-old boy in Louisiana may be a result of Hurricane Katrina. Tests of St. Bernard Parish water supply confirmed the presence of Naegleria fowleri. The water is safe to drink, state officials said, but cautioned against getting it in the nose. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm fresh water, most often in the southeastern United States. It enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. Katrina the culprit? Experts say Hurricane Katrina, which hit the state in August 2005, may ultimately be to blame. St. Bernard Parish -- where the visiting boy from Mississippi was infected while playing on a water slide -- was one of the main areas affected by the hurricane. The reduced population following the hurricane left most of the water stagnant, which affected its makeup. ""One of the concerns is that it was such a drastic population drop after Katrina and the water aged ... just by sitting in the pipes and also a drop in lower demand,"" said Jake Causey, chief engineer for the state's health and hospitals. ""The more quickly it is used up (the water), the more the water system is able to process a good chlorine system."" If the water is not used, he said, the chlorine dissipates while organisms thrive. ""We are actively increasing the chlorine level in the parish water system combined with flushing the water system,"" he said. No danger in drinking, cooking . There is no danger of infection from drinking or cooking with contaminated water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected patients are diagnosed with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Naegleria fowleri associated with disinfected public drinking water has caused deaths in only one other case in the United States, according to the CDC. The water came from an untreated drinking water system in Arizona; two children died there in 2003. Flushing water lines . Parishes along the Gulf Coast began flushing water lines with chlorine last week. The Mississippi boy contracted amoebic meningoencephalitis and died last month. Tests at the home where he was playing found the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. Officials said less than 1% of patients survive the deadly brain infection, but an experimental drug from the CDC has shown promise in fighting it. Kali Hardig, a 12-year-old in Arkansas, survived after contracting the amoeba in July, possibly at a Little Rock water park. The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache and fever. For more safety tips, visit CDC.gov. CNN's Jacque Wilson and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Reduced population following the hurricane left most of the water sitting .

"Kliptown, South Africa (CNN) -- Brian Munyai has spent nearly all of his 22 years living in a small metal shack that has never had electricity or running water. He shares a pit latrine with his neighbors. He bathes in a bucket with water drawn from the communal tap. At night, he reads by an oil lamp. Conditions like this are typical for the nearly 40,000 people who live in the slums of Kliptown, a district in the largely black township of Soweto, South Africa. Generations of families have lived in these ramshackle homes just 15 miles from Johannesburg, the economic capital of the country. The community has long suffered from high rates of unemployment, crime and school dropouts, and the end of apartheid more than two decades ago did little to change the situation. ""Living in Kliptown ... I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy,"" Munyai said. ""We are simply trying to survive."" Raised by his aunt, who often struggled to find work, Munyai found basic necessities like food and clothing difficult to come by. But although his circumstances didn't make it easy, he was determined to get an education. ""I spent a lot of time without a school uniform,"" he said, recalling the embarrassment he felt being different from classmates from middle-class neighborhoods. ""Going to school with a hungry stomach ... it was very tough."" Munyai worked hard, however, and in high school, he heard about the Kliptown Youth Program. The after-school program, commonly known as KYP, provided him with intensive tutoring that helped him pass his senior exams and find funding to attend the University of Johannesburg. He recently earned a national diploma in banking. ""This program actually changed my future,"" Munyai said. ""(Without it), right now, I would not be standing here and saying that I went to university."" Stories like this motivate Thulani Madondo, the director and co-founder of KYP. A lifelong Kliptown resident, he has a goal of helping people like Munyai change their lives and their community through education. Right now, Madondo's group provides academic support, meals and after-school activities to 400 children. ""There are more than 10,000 children in the community, so working with 400 might seem like nothing,"" Madondo said. ""But if (they) are dedicated ... we can make a difference."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Madondo, 30, grew up in a family of nine and faced many of the same struggles Munyai endured. Financial pressure forced all of his older siblings to drop out of high school. But Madondo washed cars and worked as a stock boy to earn money to stay in school, and he became the first member of his family to graduate from high school. Ultimately, he couldn't afford to go to college, which was a disappointment. ""It was hard. ... You feel like you have no power over your future,"" Madondo said. It's that mentality that Madondo and several other young Kliptown natives were looking to change when they founded the program five years ago. Rather than wait for the government to come to the rescue, they decided to take matters into their own hands. ""We didn't want to see other young people going through what we'd gone through: no uniforms ... feeling hungry in class,"" Madondo said. ""We know the problems of this community, but we also know the solutions."" For starters, the program requires a commitment from its members. Every child must come in with a parent or guardian and sign a contract. The deal is simple: Students must agree to stay in school and attend mandatory tutoring sessions twice a week; in exchange, KYP agrees to provide uniforms, books and school fees for any student who cannot afford them. ""We're not just giving handouts,"" said Madondo, whose group is funded by corporations and private donations. ""We're making kids earn whatever they get."" The organization opens the doors to its headquarters every weekday at 7 a.m. to hand out sandwiches for students to take to school. At 2 p.m., when students flood through the gates after school, everyone gets a hot meal and the chance to have some fun. But every Monday through Thursday at 4 p.m. sharp, students hit the books in the tutoring program. Primary school students are tutored by the program's staff twice a week; on alternate days, professional teachers work with the high school students to prepare them for the matriculation exams required at the end of 12th grade. On Fridays and Saturdays, students play sports or enjoy cultural activities like drumming or dancing. Books can be borrowed from the program's library -- the only one in the community -- and there are nearly 300 Internet-accessible laptops that were donated through the nonprofit One Laptop Per Child. ""Not every child will want to be in the books every day,"" Madondo explained. ""We've got to come together for fun while we also come together for academics."" It's a formula that's kept the program's members out of trouble and, more important, on track in school. Teachers report that the group's members have increased confidence, greater participation in class and better grades. And over the past four years, nearly every member has passed his or her matriculation exams. So far, 21 members, including Munyai, have gone on to a university. While the Kliptown program doesn't have the resources to pay for all of its members' higher education, it does provide some financial assistance and helps members find ways to finance the rest. The organization also tries to help the other members find internships or jobs. Madondo can be seen rushing around the program's complex six days a week. Although he's always busy, he's someone who everyone believes they can count on and look up to. ""Thulani, to be honest with you, he's my role model. He's my brother. He's my friend,"" Munyai said. ""Actually, he's a hero."" The commitment of Madondo and his staff has inspired many former students to follow in their footsteps, strengthening the organization from within. Older high school students often help tutor or run activities for the younger children, and several members have come back to work for the organization after completing high school and college. ""It's such a great thing to give back,"" said Munyai, who makes time to tutor at least twice a week. ""We can actually help the new generation to succeed. A little can go a long way."" That ""Kliptown helping Kliptown"" philosophy is an important part of what the program is all about. Madondo believes that each student who succeeds is paving the way to lift their family and their community out of poverty. When asked about their potential careers, the students' answers run the gamut: scientist, lawyer, editor, accountant. ""Helping them, I feel excited,"" Madondo said. ""We want them to realize there's something they can contribute to this world. ... We're trying to give them the sense that everything is possible."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- An American being held in a Nicaraguan prison said he is innocent and described his treatment in a ""hellhole"" in an exclusive phone interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday. ""I don't know the reason that I'm here,"" Jason Puracal said. ""That's been a mystery from the very beginning. What the motives behind the police and the prosecution have been."" Puracal, a 35-year-old from Washington state, has been behind bars since August 2010, when Nicaraguan authorities raided his real estate office in the coastal tourist city of San Juan del Sur. CNN profiled Puracal in February. In November, a Nicaraguan judge found Puracal guilty of money laundering, drug trafficking and organized crime and sentenced the American to 22 years. But a chorus of supporters say that there is no evidence to support the charges and that Puracal's prosecution was rife with legal mistakes and misconduct. Puracal's family and supporters have said that while visiting him at La Modelo, they've been shocked to see he's gotten very ill and is disturbingly underweight. ""We're really afraid that his body won't be able to take this much longer,"" said Janis Puracal, who was allowed to visit her brother in prison several months ago. Puracal described to Cooper what it's like at La Modelo prison near Managua. ""It's basically a hellhole,"" he said. ""There are concrete cells that are overcrowded. ""I've been in a cell with anywhere from 9 to 12 people in a 12-by-15-foot cell,"" Puracal continued. ""It's hot; it's dirty; it's festy. There's lots of insects, including chiggers and ants and mosquitoes. There's no running water. I have to fight every day to get your two buckets of water. There's no good food. We get rice and beans three times a day, and it has a bicarbonate added to it to make the prisoners feel full, so I can't even eat this stuff. ""I had to go to the hospital,"" he said. ""So, basically, right now, I survive on crackers and peanuts and raisins."" Those fighting to free Puracal include the director of the California Innocence Project, the human-rights attorney who helped win freedom for Burmese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and an ex-FBI agent who was one of the early champions of Amanda Knox's innocence. U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, said in February that Puracal's arrest is tantamount to kidnapping (PDF). Even the three American hikers freed from Iran have spoken out against the American's conviction. Recently, a special group of independent legal experts with the United Nations declared that Nicaragua was violating international law (PDF) by imprisoning Puracal and that he should be immediately released. Puracal's defense team provided the group's recommendation to CNN. Since CNN began reporting Puracal's story, it has made numerous attempts on the phone and in person in Nicaragua to obtain comment from officials involved in Puracal's case. Each attempt has been rebuffed. Cooper asked Puracal whether he thought the U.N. group's opinion would increase the chances that officials in Nicaragua will release him. ""I would hope so, that the administration of Nicaragua would value the independent U.N. opinion about my case,"" Puracal answered. ""However, it's been a couple weeks since that has been publicly released and about a month since Nicaragua has refused that privately, and yet I'm still sitting here."" Puracal went to Nicaragua in 2002, shortly after graduating from college in Washington, to work for the Peace Corps. He stayed there because he fell in love with the country, Janis Puracal said. He met the woman who would become his wife, a Nicaraguan national, and they had a child. Puracal developed a successful real estate business in San Juan del Sur and was even featured on the HGTV show ""House Hunters International."" He was in his office in 2010 when Nicaraguan authorities burst in with their guns drawn, he told Cooper. ""I was shocked,"" he said. ""I had donated to the police department in San Juan del Sur. And I had interacted with them on a positive basis previously, but when guys in masks and assault rifles stormed into my office, I thought I was being robbed. ""I didn't know what was going on until a plainclothes guy with a badge around his neck came in and asked for me. And then he still didn't tell me for the next two days -- even after they arrested me -- why I was being arrested or for what it was all about."" The Nicaraguan government accused Puracal of being part of a group of drug traffickers, but Puracal's defense team says investigators could not establish links between Puracal and 10 Nicaraguans who were convicted with him. Jared Genser, a well-known international human rights attorney who helped free Suu Kyi, said Puracal has never met the other defendants, and the co-defendants told the judge in the case that they had never met Puracal. When Janis Puracal, a lawyer in Seattle, approached Genser with her brother's case, he immediately took it. ""I knew that something was very wrong here"" after reviewing the court documents, he said. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention rendered its opinion that Puracal should be freed in response to a petition (PDF) Genser filed this year. The document detailed numerous alleged flaws in the case against his client. The Working Group doesn't have the authority to force a country to act in response to its opinions, but it can send a strong diplomatic and political message, Genser said. ""The fact that Jason is the only one of more than 3,000 Americans imprisoned abroad (to have the support of the U.N.), the U.N. calling for his release should demonstrate to the Nicaraguan government that its failure to resolve this case quickly will have serious diplomatic consequences,"" he said. In response to questions about Puracal's case, U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said several weeks ago that officials are ""continuing to work"" on Puracal's behalf ""through counselor and diplomatic channels."" On Wednesday, Cooper's interview with Puracal was ended abruptly after Cooper asked whether Puracal felt that he was in danger. Puracal: ""Umm ... the guards are telling me I have to go now. But thank you for your ... for your call."" Cooper: ""Is there anything you want people to know before you go?"" Puracal: ""I am 100% innocent of the crimes I've been accused of, and I can't wait to see my family. And I thank everyone for all their support and their effort.""","Jason Puracal was convicted of drug trafficking, organized crime and money laundering in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Voters in Germany will go to the polls this weekend for the first time since the eurozone crisis left the single currency -- and much of the continent -- teetering on the brink of chaos. While the campaign hasn't exactly set the world on fire -- voter apathy could prove a major issue -- what happens in ballot boxes across the nation Sunday has the potential to change the future of the euro, and of Europe. Who's in the running? Angela Merkel, the country's current chancellor, is campaigning for a third term in office. Were she to win, she would be on course to overtake Margaret Thatcher as Europe's longest-serving female political leader. Merkel, a physicist-turned-politician from the former East Germany, came to power in 2005 as leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), a center-right conservative party. Initially she served as Chancellor in a ""grand coalition"" of politicians from both sides of the political spectrum; in 2009 she won re-election at the head of a conservative coalition with the Free Democrats. Read more: Angela Merkel: Europe's Mrs. Nein . Her steady stewardship of the country through the eurozone crisis -- and her no-nonsense attitude to struggling members of the currency union -- has earned her both commendations and criticism abroad. And while she does have detractors at home, she remains Germany's most popular politician by a long way -- according to the latest Transatlantic Trends report by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, two thirds of Germans approve of her handling of the eurozone crisis. Who is she up against? Her major opponent is Social Democrat Peer Steinbrueck. Steinbrueck served as finance minister in Merkel's first government, a grand coalition between the CDU and the left-leaning SPD, from 2005 to 2009, overseeing the country's bank rescue plan. Gaffe-prone Steinbrueck caused the biggest controversy of the 2013 campaign when a photograph of him gesturing with his middle finger graced the cover of a popular magazine. Merkel's current coalition partners, the conservative Free Democrats (FDP), are struggling to connect with voters -- polls suggest they may even fall below the 5% minimum vote threshold and lose their place in Germany's parliament, the Bundestag. Read more: Peer Steinbrueck stirring up German politics . The other parties seeking electors' votes include The Left (Die Linke), headed by the charismatic Gregor Gysi and tipped to do well in the states of the former East Germany, and the Greens, who are ranking third in the latest opinion poll. Are there any newcomers on the scene? Sunday will mark the national election debut of two new parties looking to shake up the German political scene: the Pirates Party and the Alternative for Germany (AfD). All eyes will be on the ballot boxes to see whether they can secure the votes they need to win seats in the Bundestag. The AfD, founded in April 2013, is made up of so-called ""euroskeptics,"" opposed to the single European currency and to Germany's role in the bailouts of several struggling eurozone nations, which they see as a waste of money the country can ill afford. Seen by many as a ""party of professors"" the AfD currently has between 2% and 4% support, just short of the 5% it would require to take up seats in parliament. However, political commentators have warned it could damage Merkel's re-election hopes by splitting the conservative vote. Read more: Could euroskeptics spoil Merkel's party? The Pirates Party, inspired by a similar internet freedom movement in Sweden, was the surprise success story in last year's regional elections in Berlin, securing almost 9% of the vote; however, polls suggest the party is unlikely to repeat its success in the capital on a federal level. With up to a third of German voters ""undecided"" there are plenty of ballots still up for grabs. What are the big issues? There's just one, and to misquote Bill Clinton's campaign strategists: It's the economy, Dummkopf. Compared to many of its neighbours, Germany as a whole has continued to thrive throughout the eurozone crisis: it is the biggest economy in Europe, with a healthy manufacturing industry and the continent's second lowest unemployment rate. However, not all of Germany's citizens are feeling the benefit: large numbers of people are reliant on low-paid ""mini-jobs"" which leave them struggling to make ends meet. The Social Democrats are calling for a national minimum wage to combat the problem of the ""working poor."" The SPD has also called for tax increases -- a proposal rejected by Merkel. Read more: Germany playing beggar-my-neighbor with eurozone? How does voting work in Germany? Germans get two votes, one for a local candidate, and one for a party. The Bundestag's 622 seats are divided between the two, with 299 going to local candidates (under a first-past-the-post system), and the remainder allotted to politicians from party lists, on a proportional representation basis. To enter parliament, each party must secure a minimum of 5% of the vote to win seats in parliament. Votes given to parties that do not meet this threshold are redistributed amongst those who do. German politics is all about forging coalitions and alliances; no single party has governed the nation alone since reunification. Who will win? Until recently, the election looked like a slam-dunk for the popular Merkel and her allies. However, the Free Democrats' dip in the polls puts the current coalition at risk. Should the FDP lose its place in the Bundestag -- a possibility if the fledgling AfD splinters the conservative vote -- Merkel would have to cement fresh alliances in order to remain chancellor. Read more: Is Merkel the most powerful female politician? The CDU has ruled out linking up with the AfD -- despite their mutual conservatism, the AfD's resolutely anti-euro stance contradicts the Christian Democrats' policies. Instead Merkel could return to the ""grand coalition"" days of 2005-2009, working with the Social Democrats -- and Steinbrueck -- once more. Alternatively, should they perform well at the polls, the Social Democrats could seek to oust Merkel by forming a left-wing coalition with the Greens and The Left. Why should those outside Germany care? Germany is Europe's largest economy and its government has the leading voice in governing the Eurozone. If German voters decide to replace conservative Merkel with left-leaning Steinbrueck, the whole currency union could be affected. Steinbrueck is skeptical of Merkel's austerity-focused policies and has said he would do more to encourage growth and investment. Although they disagree on economic policies, Steinbrueck has made it very clear that should he win the election, he would follow in Merkel's footsteps by demanding all eurozone countries stick to ""sound fiscal discipline.""

"San Diego, California (CNN)  -- Welcome to 2010. What is your New Year's resolution? Are you planning on investing more money into the annual $40 billion dieting industry? If so, please think again. As we start our workweek, many of us are looking in the mirror and saying ""Yuck. I feel fat, uncomfortable and need to go on a diet."" Dieting and the language of ""fat"" have become so normal that we don't think twice before we say, ""I have to go on a diet, I have gained so much weight."" If we are parents of teenagers, we may as well be saying to them, ""Change yourself, fix your body. You're not perfect and never will be."" Is this how we want to empower our youth? You spend countless hours raising your child with the values of honesty, integrity and the importance of the work ethic. But if you are dieting and complaining about how fat you are, you could be putting your teenager at risk for an eating disorder. As a psychologist who has been treating eating disorders since 1985, I worry that there could be a connection between dieting parents and teenagers who develop anorexia or bulimia. The 6-year-old girl who is watching her mother suck in her stomach in front of the mirror is going to look at her belly poking out and immediately think that she is fat. How awful that we just inadvertently planted the seed of lifelong discontent with her body into the innocent mind of a 6-year-old. We have to be mindful of what we really want to emphasize as important. In this quick-fix world of Botox, plastic surgery and fad diets, our children are not being taught how to tolerate discomfort and how to work hard and patiently. ""Now"" is the demand word that parents feel compelled to cater to. We could be creating a generation of self-obsessed, narcissistic children. Do we really want them to feel that the glamour of ""Gossip Girl"" is the goal of their lives? We must draw the line by examining our own core values. The majority of us know that the quick fix is not going to work, yet we feel compelled to throw ourselves into the despair of broken diets, broken resolutions, broken promises and worse, a pervasive sense of shame that attacks the core of our being. We are so inundated with messages that are constantly redefining what is healthy that in our confusion we forget what is normal eating and a healthy, balanced lifestyle. The ""diet monster"" gobbles up our self-esteem and makes us return to that unfaithful lover again and again, only to drop more money into that $40 billion pot. We could use that money to educate millions of brains each year, better our schools, reduce poverty and attend to our elderly. Of course, eating healthily and staying active are very important. But of those who lose weight through dieting, 98 percent gain it back again in two years. Diet is a four-letter word that begins with ""die."" Isn't that ominous enough? This year, create an intention not to diet. When you do this, you are consciously rejecting the appearance-obsessed, materialistic culture that inundates us. An intention to honor your soul instead of your appearance -- to choose to give back in the community, volunteer, give time to the elderly -- will make you feel stronger. Instead of spending time counting calories or going obsessively to the gym, donate those hours to a shelter for abused women. Love your body. This year, make it your intention to teach your teenager to reject the appearance-obsessed world she lives in and have her give her heart instead of changing her body. Caution: This approach might make you start to love your body and you may waver on your New Year's resolution to lose weight! As January unfolds, we are going to be blasted with commercials from multiple sources, with each one touting a permanent relief. The net result of these commercials is to get us to continue to hate our bodies so that these diet companies can make money off our body hatred. There is also a political reason for women to be held to a high ""thin"" standard of perfection. We are then no longer a threat to anyone who wants power. ""Body Wars"" keep women in their place and are economically driven. Let us assert our power by rejecting the dieting mantra, standing our ground -- and being full of ourselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Divya Kakaiya.","Divya Kakaiya: Dieting means giving money to the annual $40 billion diet industry .

"(Health.com) -- Between puffs of his cigarette, Aristo Lizica explains why he's all for a smoking ban in public housing -- including his own housing project on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. ""When you smoke indoors, it hurts everybody,"" the 59-year-old says, leaning against an iron fence outside his building. ""It's better for me to just make myself sick."" Lizica would prefer to avoid making himself sick too, of course. ""I want to quit,"" he adds. ""I know cigarettes are bad for my health."" Yet he remains unable to kick the habit. Federal housing officials are trying to help people like Lizica -- and his neighbors -- by making public housing smoke-free. Full or partial smoking bans would reduce secondhand smoke drifting between apartments, prevent cigarette-related fires, and even help smokers quit, they argue. ""We see it as a win-win for both residents and housing authorities,"" says Donna White, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the federal agency that oversees public housing. 15 ways smoking ruins your looks . In a 2009 memo, the department highlighted the dangers that indoor smoking poses to the nation's 2.1 million public housing residents, and ""strongly encouraged"" local housing authorities to implement smoking restrictions. But doing so remains voluntary, and so far only about 4 percent of local authorities have taken the step. ""Change is hard,"" White says. Public health experts are hoping to light a fire under the cause. In a paper published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, a team of researchers and attorneys from Harvard University argue that the health and safety gains of a smoking ban in housing projects would far outweigh the losses, which some say would include the privacy rights of smokers. Yet smokers like Lizica could prove to be the biggest winners, the authors suggest. ""If federal officials and public housing authorities take this cue, we can expect to have large numbers of people quit smoking,"" says the lead author of the article, Jonathan Winickoff, M.D., a pediatrician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, in Boston. ""That could be the single greatest health benefit."" Although the exact numbers of smokers in housing projects are unknown, about 30 percent of Americans living below the poverty line smoke tobacco, more than 1.5 times the rate of those who live above it. 70 years of menthol cigarette ads . The idea that the government can tell people what to do in their own homes is controversial, however. As Winickoff and his colleagues acknowledge, the smoking restrictions they support are ""morally offensive to some"" because the restrictions would be imposed on residents who are poor and unable to easily relocate if they disagree with them. Indeed, not all residents of public housing support the idea. ""I do want to quit, but at the end of the day, we shouldn't care what others do,"" says Esther Matos, 29, who lives and smokes in Lizica's housing project. ""Don't bother me, and I won't bother them."" Even nonsmoker Lizzie Middleton, a 65-year-old survivor of lung and colon cancer, agrees. ""It may be public housing, but people still pay rent and bills and buy their own cigarettes,"" she says. ""They have the right to smoke in their own home."" But HUD officials and the Harvard researchers argue that smokers such as Matos are, in fact, bothering their neighbors and harming the health of those around them. Secondhand smoke and third-hand smoke -- the toxic residue left behind on walls, carpets, and clothes long after a cigarette is extinguished -- are bad news, especially for children, pregnant women, people with chronic illnesses, and the elderly, Winickoff and his colleagues note. These vulnerable groups are disproportionately represented in public housing, they point out, and may be at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, respiratory infections, heart attacks, and cancer. 6 common smoking triggers -- and how to fight them . Just a few smokers can cause a big impact in a large apartment building, Winickoff says. ""Tobacco smoke can stick around for weeks, months, even years,"" he explains. ""Smoke doesn't know to stop at a doorway. It travels through air vents and cracks in walls, along ventilation and elevator shafts, and up stairways."" Smoking bans might also reduce the number of smokers and prevent young people from starting in the first place, says Michelle Mello, Ph.D., a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health, and one of Winickoff's co-authors. ""If we can remove the constant exposure to this behavior as well as to the smoke itself, we also stand a better chance of keeping at-risk youth from beginning to smoke,"" Mello says. 10 crazy ways smokers finally kicked the habit . Even proponents acknowledge that smoking restrictions could prove difficult to enforce, however. Mello believes that smoking could be regulated in public housing in the same way that drugs and alcohol are, but she and her co-authors note that penalties -- including eviction- may be hard to impose. Although cities such as Boston, Seattle, and Denver have begun to roll out smoking bans in recent years, most of the cities and towns that have implemented restrictions to date are small and have relatively few housing projects. Social, sneaky, or skinny? The 7 types of smokers . Milford, Connecticut, is one of the few cities that have responded to HUD's urging. In March, the city's public housing authority passed a nonsmoking ordinance that covers all 465 of its units. (Current tenants have until November 1 to comply.) ""We've had broad, positive support,"" says Anthony Vasiliou, executive director of the Milford Housing Authority. The day after the ordinance was passed, he says, a longtime smoker and public housing resident personally thanked him, and told him she believed the ban would give her the motivation to finally quit. ""Believe it or not,"" says Winickoff, ""even some smokers want smoke-free housing."" Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","Federal housing officials argue that smoking bans would help smokers quit .

The pioneering grunge band has just released ""Black Gives Way to Blue"" -- its first studio album since singer Layne Staley died from a heroin and cocaine overdose in 2002 -- and fans are understandably playing a game of compare and contrast. With his scruffy blond goatee and pain-laced baritone, Staley may have been the face and voice of Alice in Chains, but in many ways, guitarist Jerry Cantrell has been the unsung heart of it, writing much of the band's catalogue and singing half of the droning harmonies that would become group's trademark. These days, when Cantrell shares the mic with new vocalist William DuVall, the blend is uncannily familiar. DuVall's voice can sound eerily like Staley's, but instead of being borne of desperation, it suggests a certain soulfulness that becomes more apparent on live acoustic tracks.  Watch DuVall blend his talents with the band » . We caught up with DuVall and Cantrell, along with bassist Mike Inez and drummer Sean Kinney, as they shot the video for their current single, ""Check My Brain,"" on a Hollywood soundstage. The song is currently No. 1 on both Billboard's Rock Chart and Alternative Chart. CNN: Will, you're stepping into some big shoes there with this Alice in Chains legacy. Jerry Cantrell: He's got his own big shoes. William DuVall: Size 13, baby! CNN: But there had to have been some soul-searching when you took this job. DuVall: It's not as though it happened out of the blue There's a back story to this process that predates the 2006 touring that sort of began this whole thing. I've known Jerry almost 10 years now. We've admired one another's work for a long time. There's a friendship here. It's actually not too unlike what probably happened to them when they first started the band back in the late '80s. Friendships develop, and then you start creating music together. So all this stuff developed very naturally. There was never a point where we drew a line and said, ""Now here is where the resurrection begins!"" So there wasn't any baggage attached to it. CNN: People like a good comeback story -- but at the same time, you have some fans who are saying, ""How dare you go on without Layne."" Cantrell: Well, you can listen to those old records and we'll make some new ones. They're there! We're lucky to have a pretty strong core audience that has kind of been with us through thick and thin, and that's cool. We're not really for everybody, and that's fine with us. It's nice to have an opinion about it, but all that stuff happened to us for real. It's really our life. So for us to come through that type of adversity, and for us to stand up, I think is a pretty heroic thing and I'm really proud of all of us. Mike Inez: Ultimately, we're our own hardest, harshest critics, you know. If the four guys here didn't feel good about this, we just wouldn't do it. CNN: You have the blessing of Layne's family, correct? Cantrell: Well, they are family, and they've always been supportive through it, and we love them dearly. Layne and his family are always a part of our family, and always will be. It's all good. CNN: What has changed in terms of the sound? Cantrell: Well, we added a member, so Will's going to bring himself and his talents to the band. But the musical core of the band is intact, and a lot of the writing part of it is intact. CNN: People have been asking us, ""What does Alice in Chains sound like now?"" And for me, the answer is, ""Well, they kind of sound like Alice in Chains."" Sean Kinney: Yeah, shocking isn't it, that we sound like ourselves! That blows my mind. People are always doing it -- ""Well, you sound like yourself."" I don't know what we're supposed to sound like. I mean, Three Dog Night? Would have been cool with me, but I'll just stick with our thing. CNN: Jerry, the first single, ""Check My Brain,"" comes from your experience moving to Los Angeles from Seattle. Cantrell: Yeah, it's kind of a funny thing. Being from Seattle, it's pretty easy to make fun of the Southern California lifestyle, or maybe it's easy for a lot of people to take a shot at it. But this is where I ended up, and still can't believe I'm living here. But I'm digging it! No need to rock the boat, man. [Breaks into song] ""Rock the boat, don't rock the boat, baby!"" CNN: That could be a big hit for somebody, but Alice in Chains? Inez: What band was that? DuVall: Hues Corporation [Everyone laughs]. But this place does a mind job on everybody -- the warped sensibility that this place has, and the dream factory element. A lot of dreams have been scattered and broken on the ground, but that experience happens everywhere, too. Kinney: I still live in Seattle, but I've been down here so much lately that I noticed I've been getting out of cars with no panties, which is weird for me. But that's what happens when you're in L.A., I guess.","Alice in Chains' new album, ""Black Gives Way to Blue,"" hit No. 1 .
