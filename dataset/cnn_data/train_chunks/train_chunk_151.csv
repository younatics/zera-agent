"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Interest in President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration is running so high that one ticket broker is asking $20,095 for a single ticket. The government has printed 250,000 tickets so far for Barack Obama's presidential inauguration on January 20. Entry to the biggest event in Washington is free if your congressman or senator grants your request, but with demand outpacing supply a traditional giveaway has turned into a thriving online marketplace. Legitimate ticket brokers -- the same companies that peddle tickets to rock concerts and NASCAR races -- are selling tickets to the swearing-in of Barack Obama for thousands of dollars, even for standing-room areas on the National Mall. Organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the January 20 ceremony. ""We think it's absolutely insane to be selling those tickets. We understand some people want to make a buck, but for those people thinking of buying tickets, it's buyer beware,"" warned Howard Gantman, staff director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.  Watch why the tickets are going for top dollar » . The government has printed 250,000 tickets so far, holding them in a secure location. For information on how to get one, check out http://inaugural.senate.gov/. Ticket brokers act as middlemen, selling inaugural tickets they say they purchase from Capitol Hill employees and people who get them from members of Congress. Since the government releases tickets at the last minute -- less than a week before the inauguration -- ticket brokers cannot ensure they will receive enough tickets to cover their orders. Web sites promise a full refund if tickets are not secured to buyers, but that offer may be little consolation to people who invest in a trip to Washington to see the inauguration. Since tickets do not have attendees' names on them, Gantman said it's inevitable some will be sold. ""Some will be distributed this way. It happens with baseball games and concerts. But we are going to take every step we can to make sure these tickets get into the hands of those who themselves intend to attend this event."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the inauguration committee, said Monday she she was prepared to ask Congress to make it a crime to scalp inauguration tickets. ""We have heard reports that there are people trying to scalp Inaugural tickets for more than $40,000 each. This is unconscionable and must not be allowed,"" Feinstein said in a statement. ""This inauguration will be the major civic event of our time, and these tickets are supposed to be free for the people. Nobody should have to pay for their tickets,"" she added. The inaugural committee is alerting lawmakers that it is a violation of Congress' code of ethics for members or staff to sell their tickets.","NEW: Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- At its essence, the presidential inaugural symbolizes American democracy's peaceful transition or extension of power. Every four years, the winner of the preceding November election swears to defend the Constitution. Cannons boom and bands play. It all unfolds outside in public, usually before a massive throng that thunders its approval. The simple practice and symbolism of inaugurating a president has remained consistent throughout American history -- 56 times before Sunday -- although the date, the pomp and the ceremony have changed since George Washington took the first oath 224 years ago. 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on CNN's platforms and nowhere else . The first . Thirteen years after the Declaration of Independence and more than a year and a half after the Constitution was ratified, Washington was sworn in on April 20, 1789, at Federal Hall in New York. The capital city later named for Washington was just a swamp at the time. He set the precedent of kissing the Bible after the oath. Champagne glasses and buttons galore: Obama swag at Inaugural store . Franklin Pierce broke the tradition of kissing the Bible. He placed his left hand on it instead in 1853. Washington is also credited with creating other traditions. For instance, he started the inaugural parade when government officials, members of Congress, Army units, and prominent citizens escorted him to the ceremony. The oath . The oath of office is specified in Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. The oath for other federal officials, including the vice president, is not in the Constitution. The oath of office reads, ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. All dressed up and nowhere to go: The date night that Ticketmaster messed up . The ""(or affirm)"" allows the president-elect to choose to affirm or to swear the oath of office. Only Pierce and Herbert Hoover chose to affirm rather than swear their oath. The words ""so help me God"" do not appear in the Constitutional oath. That phrase was supposedly ad-libbed by Washington, setting a precedent for future presidents. President Barack Obama has requested his oath include the phrase. The Bible . A personal aspect of the inauguration is the Bible. John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president -- his religious identity was a contentious issue in his run for office. By the Numbers: Presidential inaugurations . Only three presidents did not use a Bible: John Qunicy Adams opted for a volume of law; Theodore Roosevelt used no Bible or book at his first inauguration in 1901. Lyndon Johnson used John F. Kennedy's Roman Catholic Missal during his hastily arranged swearing-in aboard Air Force One en route to Washington following Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. The speech . Like fingerprints, no inaugural address is the same -- they come in all lengths, tones and with all kinds of different motives. Some aim to set the agenda for the president's term, others aim to define how the president will govern. Washington delivered the shortest address at his second inauguration in Philadelphia. It totaled 135 words. The longest was about 8,500 words and delivered by William Henry Harrison, who refused to wear coat on the cold March day in 1841. He caught a cold and died from pneumonia a month later. Memorable lines . Some memorable lines from inaugural addresses: . ""With malice toward none, with charity for all."" - Abraham Lincoln, March 1865. ""Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" - Franklin . D. Roosevelt, March 1933. ""And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you â€” ask what you can do for your country."" - John F. Kennedy, January 1961. Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company . Pastor backs out of inauguration . Double Take . January 20 falls on a Sunday this year as it did in 1917, 1957 and 1985. As a result, Obama will take the official oath in a private ceremony that day at the White House. He will follow up with the public ceremony on Monday at the Capitol. Obama will be the first president to have two oaths administered publicly and privately. In 2009, Chief Justice John Roberts flubbed the oath as he read it Obama during the public ceremony. They did it again the next day at the White House to leave no question . iReport: I hope Obama will... Other facts: . Thomas Jefferson was the first president inaugurated in Washington, March 1801. The first inauguration on January 20 by decree of the 20th Amendment was in 1937. Andrew Jackson was the first to take the oath on the East Front of the Capitol. Ronald Reagan of California was the first to be inaugurated on the West Front of the Capitol in 1980. Jimmy Carter, in 1976, was the first to walk from the Capitol to the White House. The first inaugural streamed live on the Internet was Bill Clinton's second ceremony in 1997. 13,000 troops to descend on D.C. for inauguration . CNN's Connor Finnegan and Robert Yoon contributed to this report .","George Washington's first inauguration took place on April 30, 1789, and not in the city named for him .
As allowed by the Constitution, only two presidents chose to ""affirm"" rather than swear their oaths .
Obama will be sworn-in twice; once on Sunday in private and again on Monday in public .

"LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- Joey Bishop, the stone-faced comedian who found success in nightclubs, television and movies but became most famous as a member of Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack, has died at 89. Joey Bishop was the last surviving member of the Rat Pack. He was the group's last surviving member. Peter Lawford died in 1984, Sammy Davis Jr. in 1990, Dean Martin in 1995, and Sinatra in 1998. Bishop died Wednesday night of multiple causes at his home in Newport Beach, publicist and longtime friend Warren Cowan said Thursday. The Rat Pack -- originally a social group surrounding Humphrey Bogart -- became a show business sensation in the early 1960s, appearing at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas in shows that combined music and comedy in a seemingly chaotic manner. Reviewers often claimed that Bishop played a minor role, but Sinatra knew otherwise. He termed the comedian ""the Hub of the Big Wheel,"" with Bishop coming up with some of the best one-liners and beginning many jokes with his favorite phrase, ""Son of a gun!"" The quintet lived it up whenever members were free of their own commitments. They appeared together in such films as ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""Sergeants 3"" and proudly gave honorary membership to a certain fun-loving politician from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy, at whose inauguration gala Bishop served as master of ceremonies. The Rat Pack faded after Kennedy's assassination, but the late 1990s brought a renaissance, with the group depicted in an HBO movie and portrayed by imitators in Las Vegas and elsewhere. The movie ""Ocean's Eleven"" was even remade in 2003 with George Clooney and Brad Pitt in the lead roles. Bishop defended his fellow performers' rowdy reputations in a 1998 interview. ""Are we remembered as being drunk and chasing broads?"" he asked. ""I never saw Frank, Dean, Sammy or Peter drunk during performances. That was only a gag. And do you believe these guys had to chase broads? They had to chase 'em away."" Away from the Rat Pack, Bishop starred in two TV series, both called ""The Joey Bishop Show."" The first, an NBC sitcom, got off to a rocky start in 1961. Critical and audience response was generally negative, and the second season brought a change in format. The third season brought a change in network, with the show moving to ABC, but nothing seemed to help and it was canceled in 1965. In the first series, Bishop played a TV talk show host. Then, he really became a TV talk show host. His program was started by ABC in 1967 as a challenge to Johnny Carson's immensely popular ""The Tonight Show."" Like Carson, Bishop sat behind a desk and bantered with a sidekick, TV newcomer Regis Philbin. But despite an impressive guest list and outrageous stunts, Bishop couldn't dent Carson's ratings, and ""The Joey Bishop Show"" was canceled after two seasons. Philbin remembered Bishop fondly. ""It was the thrill of my life to be chosen by Joey as the announcer for his talk show on ABC back in the '60s,"" he said in a statement. ""I learned a lot about the business of making people laugh. He was a master comedian and a great teacher and I will never forget those days or him."" After the talk show's cancellation, Bishop became a familiar guest figure in TV variety shows and as sub for vacationing talk show hosts, filling in for Carson 205 times. He also played character roles in such movies as ""The Naked and the Dead"" (""I played both roles""), ""Onion-head,"" ""Johnny Cool,"" ""Texas Across the River,"" ""Who's Minding the Mint?"" ""Valley of the Dolls"" and ""The Delta Force."" His comedic schooling came from vaudeville, burlesque and nightclubs. Skipping his last high school semester in Philadelphia, he formed a music and comedy act with two other boys, and they played clubs in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They called themselves the Bishop Brothers, borrowing the name from their driver, Glenn Bishop. Joseph Abraham Gottlieb would eventually adopt Joey Bishop as his stage name. When his partners got drafted, Bishop went to work as a single, playing his first solo date in Cleveland at the well-named El Dumpo. During these early years he developed his style: laid-back drollery, with surprise throwaway lines. After 3 1/2 years in the Army, Bishop resumed his career in 1945. Within five years he was earning $1,000 a week at New York's Latin Quarter. Sinatra saw him there one night and hired him as opening act. While most members of the Sinatra entourage treated the great man gingerly, Bishop had no inhibitions. He would tell audiences that the group's leader hadn't ignored him: ""He spoke to me backstage; he told me, 'Get out of the way.' "" When Sinatra almost drowned filming a movie scene in Hawaii, Bishop wired him: ""I thought you could walk on water."" Born in New York's borough of the Bronx, Bishop was the youngest of five children of two immigrants from Eastern Europe. When he was 3 months old the family moved to South Philadelphia, where he attended public schools. He recalled being an indifferent student, once remarking, ""In kindergarten, I flunked sand pile."" In 1941 Bishop married Sylvia Ruzga and, despite the rigors of a show business career, the marriage survived until her death in 1999. Bishop, who spent his retirement years on the upscale Lido Isle in Southern California's Newport Bay, is survived by son Larry Bishop; grandchildren Scott and Kirk Bishop; and longtime companion Nora Garabotti.

"(CNN) -- Approaching Lance Armstrong's interview with Oprah Winfrey, I had been thinking the American -- in his type of language -- was ""done with cycling."" Used, abused and accused by fans and federations, no doubt he was feeling he had been rolled over by the cycling world, despite his years of sacrifice and heroics. After all, hadn't they taken the ride with him? Enjoyed the fame, bought the story and sold it -- all packaged up in a shiny cover. Those rulemakers and followers, who now wanted their pound of flesh, weren't they the same ones who had spouted the promises of globalization, dreamed of expanding markets and then cuddled up for the photo opportunity with the Hollywood A-listers that the Lance show brought to the table? For a sport struggling with an image problem, Lance was their savior. Jeez, even the French pretended they liked it and as long as the dollars kept rolling in, they were happy to put up with a bit of American rock 'n' roll. Now it's all come to an end and it's a rather sad, dirty end to what was supposed to be a Disney-esque fairytale in lycra. The savior is a sinner after all. Cycling hadn't wanted to see Lance as anything other than the big, brash, bold Texan. It suited their needs to see the fierce competitor, the athlete who dominated the Tour de France seven times, forgetting that behind the facade was a man just like other men -- not perfect, but flawed. Don't forget it was those very flaws of character which made Lance the competitor, the one who would do what it took to win and came to consider performance enhancing drugs as part of his job. In a culture which for so many years had had such an expectancy to cheat whenever possible, there was nobody to question him. Nobody to stop him taking control of the process -- planning it and perfecting it. It was a process Lance called easy and it was if that process became more fulfilling than the victories and the fame, which may seem crazy, but then again the top athlete are rarely wired in the same way as the rest of the population. Competitors like Armstrong have stuff to prove to themselves, and to others, and it's rarely pretty. iReport: Tell us your take on the first part of the interview . Cycling fans rejoiced in his ruthlessness, his commitment and his brutal desire to win. Meanwhile his sponsors -- some of the world's biggest brands remember -- had willingly used him to promote their products, build the image and sell the dream. With his confession all that is over and Armstrong sees the anger of those same people who wanted to believe. My biggest surprise was that the Oprah interview did not descend into the all too common excuses and crocodile tears we have seen from those in a similar predicament. There was no blaming anyone else, no recriminations and no hiding that he did it. Lance taking the blame -- that is what shocked me the most. There's no doubt he has been aided by others in his quest to prove what he wanted to prove, but Armstrong accepts the responsibility for the deception and he accepts that the fallout is going to come his way. When did that last happen with a figure as big as Armstrong had become? Previous award winners of ""most hated cyclist"" all denied it was them or that they really did cheat. Pathetically, some of them said it was others that did it -- much like a 10-year-old would -- or that they had thought about it but then couldn't. Arguably none of them has told the story in the way Armstrong has done. Sure Lance had tried the denials, told us all about the tests he had passed and convinced most people -- who didn't have the knowledge of just how tainted cycling was -- that he was clean. And now on Oprah's sofa, just when we were all expecting more of the same, it's been replaced with an honesty which shocks. There still remains a glimmer of hope for the sport of cycling. Armstrong said as much when he admitted the new drug testing and whereabouts program was working. It's no longer as easy to cheat, the culture is finally changing, but that's a process which is going to hurt the governing bodies just as much as the dramas which are going to arrive on Armstrong's doorstep. I don't feel sorry for Lance and refreshingly I don't get the feeling he has asked me to feel sorry for him. He did it -- he was the bully, the liar, the one hiding behind the image. It'll take many years for him to recover from where he is at the moment and it might be the case that he never does in many people's eyes. The cancer community and his Livestrong work is now all that remains of what Armstrong did right. Cycling, indeed sport in general, has been deeply damaged by the American, and by those who advised, supplied and turned the other cheek because it suited them as well. But you know what? The new Lance that tells the truth and accepts his mistakes still has hope because finally he's realized it's OK to be human. That's a person some could, despite the current mess, begin to forgive. It won't be easy though.","In interview with Oprah Winfrey, Lance Armstrong says he regrets fighting the USADA, when the agency claimed he had doped .
""I was a bully,"" he says about retaliating against people who accused him of doping .
I will spend the rest of my life ... trying to earn back trust and apologize,"" Armstrong says ."
"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Long before U2 and Bono blazed their own paths, and decades before the Christian music industry became a half-billion-dollar annual business, a hippie musician with long blond locks paved the way. Larry Norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex and Jesus -- sometimes in the same song. Larry Norman was a Christian rock musician before the genre existed, combining faith with a backbeat and social consciousness. Think of him as rock music's street preacher, often referred to as ""the father of Christian rock."" ""Between 1969 and 1979, Larry Norman was the Christian rock scene's answer to Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Mick Jagger,"" said Emmy-nominated director David Di Sabatino, who takes a critical look at Norman's career and life in his documentary ""Fallen Angel: The Outlaw Larry Norman."" ""He set the standard. He created the space for others to exist. ... The vision he created for where Christian rock music could go still resonates today."" The documentary is scheduled to go into limited theatrical release in early 2010. Norman hit the U.S. music scene at a turbulent time for the nation. His first solo album, ""Upon This Rock,"" came out in late 1969, after he left the band People! The San Francisco Bay area psychedelic group was fresh off the success of a Top 20 hit with a cover of the Zombies' ""I Love You."" It was a time when college campuses were erupting in anti-Vietnam War protests and the nation was still trying to digest what had just happened that summer at Woodstock. As many Americans looked for answers, Norman offered his faith, a bold decision for an unknown solo artist making his major-label debut. ""It was a pretty gutsy move to sing about Jesus on his first record,"" younger brother Charles Norman said. ""To take a chance on mentioning Jesus on a secular record was a pretty important step."" "" 'Upon This Rock' was written to stand outside the Christian culture,"" Larry Norman said in an interview with CCM magazine. ""My songs weren't written for Christians. ... I was saying, 'I'm going to present the Gospel, and I'm not going to say it like you want. This album is not for you.' "" No small surprise, given that rock music at the time was the soundtrack of the counterculture and was far from the mainstream. A national survey conducted by Louis Harris and Associates in 1966 found that rock 'n' roll was by far the most unpopular music in the country. About 45 percent of adults said they disliked it, with only about 5 percent saying it was their favorite. Compare that with today, when nearly two-thirds of those asked in a recent Pew Resource Center poll said they listen to it. Being a rocker in the late 1960s wasn't just flying in the face of a conservative Christian music industry but mainstream America as well. Then there were the lyrics, especially on Norman's second solo effort, 1972's ""Only Visiting This Planet."" There were no happy songs about going to heaven; the tunes tackled the social issues of the day. Norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex, venereal disease and Jesus -- sometimes in the same song -- getting his music banned from Christian bookstores that might have sold it. ""Stuff like that shocked uptight Christians,"" Charles Norman said in an NPR interview shortly after his brother's death in February 2008 at age 60. ""One of his songs, it's called 'Why Don't You Look Into Jesus,' one of the lines is: 'You've got gonorrhea on Valentine's Day [VD] and you're still looking for the perfect lay. ... Why don't you look into Jesus? He's got the answer.'"" The album also contained what became Larry Norman's signature song, ""Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music."" Nearly two decades after its release, ""Only Visiting This Planet,"" helmed by Beatles' producer George Martin, was recognized as a seminal recording for the genre, voted by CCM magazine in 1990 as the greatest Christian album ever recorded. A similar list released in 2001 by CCM, a Christian music and lifestyle magazine, put the album at No. 2 all time. U2's ""The Joshua Tree"" was sixth. Norman was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame that same year, along with Elvis Presley. The accolades came much sooner in the mainstream media. In 1971, Billboard Magazine called Norman ""the most important writer since Paul Simon,"" while Time magazine pegged him as ""probably the top solo artist in the field."" Norman's fans include U2, Guns N' Roses and Bob Dylan, according to his brother Charles. John Mellencamp said he's one, too. British pop star Cliff Richard made no secret of his admiration. ""When I first became a Christian, I hunted around in vain to find Christian rock 'n' roll music I could relate to. It just all sounded horrible,"" Richard said on ""Rockspell,"" a Gospel-music-themed BBC television show he hosted in 1986, and on which Norman appeared. Then he was introduced to Norman's music, ""and I just was overjoyed and thrilled, because suddenly I could relate ... and there seemed to be a Christian who could do it as well, if not better, than the rest of us."" Black Francis of the alternative rock group the Pixies said Norman has been a lifelong influence. ""I listened to his records growing up, and saw him perform many times. In fact, I used to dress up like him; long blond hair with bangs, sort of a grown-out British invasion look, with black jacket, black shirt, black pants and two-tone black and white cheerleader shoes,"" Francis said. ""While Larry is always referenced by his Christian beliefs, to me he was always an entertainer ... humorous, poignant and always rock 'n' roll. His respect for the arena of entertainment is what gave him his power as a performer."" More than 300 versions of Norman's songs have been recorded by other artists, including non-Gospel acts as diverse as Richard and Francis, as well as Sammy Davis Jr., Petula Clark and Tennessee Ernie Ford. Christian music has come a long way in the 40 years since Norman pioneered Christian rock. ""Before Larry Norman, there was not any Christian music industry,"" said Shawn McSpadden, manager for Switchfoot and the Grammy Award-winning band Third Day. But today is a different story, according to figures from the Gospel Music Association. It says 56 million units of Christian/Gospel music sold in 2008, totaling nearly $500 million. ""The Christian music industry has been very business-savvy, probably without even realizing it, in that a lot of the artists and bands use their local church as their home base when they begin their careers,"" said Bruce Burch of the University of Georgia's Music Business School. ""They immediately have fans that are passionate and devout not only about them as a band or artist, but to their message."" Album sales for the genre, during 2008, outsold classical, jazz, new age and Latin, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Norman, a hippie musician who set out to sing about his faith, blazed the trail for Christian rock.","Larry Norman was Christian rock musician before genre existed .

"(CNN) -- One of London's most iconic landmarks is being given a green energy makeover as part of the city's preparations to host the most environmentally friendly Olympic Games in history. Tower Bridge, which has spanned the River Thames for over 100 years, is being retrofitted with an LED lighting system that will reduce the structure's energy consumption by 40%, according to the City of London. The project will be completed by the start of this summer's sporting extravaganza and will cut it's electricity bills, making the bridge cheaper to maintain and operate. But while the new-look lighting will go some way to accentuating the structure's unmistakeable features, one green building expert believes retrofitting famous monuments can do more than just add to their aesthetic. ""These high profile projects can highlight the importance of retrofitting and cause people to think about installing renewable energy systems on the micro level,"" says John Alker, director of policy at the UK Green Building Council. ""Relatively speaking, Tower Bridge will save a small amount of energy but this could translate into a quite significant proportion if people can be persuaded to follow,"" he adds. In recent years, other famous landmarks have adopted a similarly proactive approach to reducing their carbon output. The Vatican City, the Empire State Building and the Sydney Opera House have all employed low-energy solutions in one form or another. Alker is enthusiastic about the benefits of retrofitting famous landmarks, but warns that a balance must be found so that the integrity of historic buildings can be maintained. ""You have to be particularly sensitive, particularly to the facade of the building"" he says. ""But in many cases much of what can be done -- like improving insulation, replacing windows and making air conditioning more efficient -- doesn't necessarily have to be visibly noticeable or negligible on the aesthetic value of the building,"" he adds.","Tower Bridge in London is being retrofitted with LED light bulbs that will reduce its energy consumption by 40% .
The project will be completed by the start of the 2012 Olympics, which are aiming to be the greenest ever .

"Washington (CNN) -- After weeks of U.S. and NATO bombardment, about one-third of Moammar Gadhafi's ground armor has been destroyed, as well as most of the fixed air defense sites and aircraft, but a stalemate between government and rebel forces is emerging and could last for some time, according to a senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest military assessments. The official agreed to speak Monday only on background because of the sensitive nature of the information. The official said the latest U.S. and NATO view is that both sides essentially remain in their fixed positions -- the rebels near Ajdabiya and the pro-government forces near al-Brega. Rebels say no to African Union-brokered deal . ""Neither side has the wherewithal to move,"" the official said. Rebels do not have the manpower, vehicles or weapons to make major advances. And while Gadhafi's forces continue their attacks, especially in Misrata, the source said they are suffering from a lack of supplies, ammunition and fuel because of airstrikes. The official said that a major ground force movement would put Gadhafi's units in the cross hairs of NATO airstrikes. Airstrikes have rebels clinging to hope . That said, the official acknowledged strongly that the onslaught by Gadhafi forces in Misrata has put people there in a dire situation. The official described a military scenario in which the United States and NATO have direct knowledge of civilians being killed but have been unable to act because Gadhafi forces and armor are so mixed with civilian populations, it's become impossible to launch airstrikes against them. The United States and NATO also think that Gadhafi's forces still have as many as 15,000 shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, which has resulted in limited use of AC-130 aircraft, which are vulnerable to being shot down as they fly low and slow to engage in the type of precision airstrikes needed in a place like Misrata. The attacks also have affected Gadhafi's ability to communicate with his commanders. He is still having face-to-face meetings with key associates, the official said, but is largely unable to communicate directly with units in the field. There are still some fiber-optic communications capabilities as well as communications nodes in schools and mosques that are very difficult to strike. Report tracks ""sweeping changes"" in Mideast . On the other side, another senior U.S. official who is familiar with administration contacts with the opposition said the opposition's leadership seems to be sincere and earnest about its aim of toppling Gadhafi, but the leaders are not as organized as they need to be.

"(CNN) -- Algerian troops ended a hostage crisis at a remote gas facility Saturday with one last, bloody assault, Algerian and Western officials said, after three days of chaos and confusion left dozens dead and fanned fears of a new terror front in Africa. At least 23 hostages and 32 ""terrorists"" were killed around the sprawling facility in eastern Algeria's desert, the Algerian interior ministry said Saturday. Some 685 Algerian workers and 107 foreigners have been freed, it said. It is not clear just how many people are still unaccounted for. A senior U.S. official said two Americans were among that number. The saga closed after a ""final"" assault, which itself contributed to the deaths of seven hostages and 11 militants, according to Algerian state media reports. An Algerian Radio report did not specify the nationalities of those killed. CNN is unable to verify the state media figures on the deaths. Afterward, Algeria's military continued to clear mines planted by militants, the official Algerian Press Service reported, citing the country's state-owned oil and gas company. ""While the site is still dangerous and there may be explosives that will need to be dealt with, the terrorist incident is now over,"" said British Prime Minister David Cameron, citing his conversation with his Algerian counterpart. The militant siege caught the world's attention as it ensnared citizens from several nations and dragged on for days. Algerian authorities said they believe the attack was revenge for allowing France to use Algerian airspace for an offensive against Islamist militants in neighboring Mali. Whatever the rationale, the scale and gore of the terror has stirred world leaders to press for action beyond Algeria, especially with Islamic extremists asserting themselves more and more in recent weeks. ""Let me be clear: There is no justification for taking innocent life in this way,"" Cameron said. ""Our determination is stronger than ever to work with allies ... around the world to root out and defeat this terrorist scourge and those who encourage it."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Algerian authorities ""certainly worked very hard to try to save the lives of people from other countries.Â I think it's actually too early to pass judgment on (the Algerian military operation)."" U.S. President Barack Obama said his administration would work with other countries to ""combat the scourge of terrorism in the region, which has claimed too many innocent lives. This attack is another reminder of the threat posed by al Qaeda and other violent extremist groups in North Africa."" In a statement, Obama said the United States will work with Algeria to prevent future such incidents. Crisis highlights pressure, potential on Algeria . Algerian special forces moved in because the terrorists wanted to flee for Mali -- apparently to pressure France and others who have recently intervened in that country -- Algerian state TV reported Saturday. The Islamic extremists also planned to blow up the gas installation, a threat that initially prompted Algeria to halt its military operation. The location was rigged to explode, with mines planted throughout, according to the senior U.S. official. Algeria's status as Africa's largest natural gas producer, and as a major supplier of the product to Europe, heightens its importance to other nations and businesses who want to invest there. Yet that interest is coupled with pressure to make sure foreign nationals, and their business ventures, are safe. The targeted plant in In Amenas, which is just 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the Libyan border, is run by Algeria's state oil company, in cooperation with foreign firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP. Saturday's last push there follows another one two days earlier, which spurred criticism from some countries that Algeria had unnecessarily endangered hostages' lives. British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain was still pressing the Algerian government for full details, while confirming the Saturday assault resulted in more deaths. He called the loss of life ""appalling and unacceptable,"" laying blame solely on the terrorists. Like Cameron, Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman Svein Michelsen confirmed that the Algerian military offensive was over, but did not offer further details. Nations scramble to account for missing . The overall death toll could rise, Algerian state TV reports, as authorities are still combing the area. Amid the uncertainty, individual nations are scrambling to find out what happened to their citizens. It is not clear how many hostages were seized by the Islamist militants in the first place. Five Norwegians are missing while ""eight are now safe,"" Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said. Five British nationals and one UK resident are missing or feared dead in Algeria, Hague told reporters. This is in addition to one Briton, whose death was previously announced. Colombia's president said a citizen was presumed dead. The Scottish government said eight of its residents are safe. There are no known French hostages unaccounted for, a Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Saturday. Three French nationals who were at the site are safe, the foreign ministry has said. One man -- identified as Yann Desjeux -- died after telling the French newspaper Sud Ouest on Thursday that he and 34 other hostages of nine different nationalities were well-treated. Of the BP employees, 14 are safe, and four BP employees are still missing in Algeria, BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said. At least one American, identified as Frederick Buttaccio, is among the dead, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. The senior U.S. official told CNN that six freed Americans left Algeria and one remained. One Romanian lost his life, a spokeswoman for the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN on Saturday. Four other Romanians were freed. And there are 14 Japanese unaccounted for, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. Malaysia's state-run news agency reported Thursday that two of its citizens were held captive. Dramatic tales of escape from terror . When the crisis began Wednesday, militants gathered the Westerners into a group and tied them up, survivors said. The kidnappers wielded AK-47 rifles and put explosive-laden vests on some hostages, according to a U.S. State Department official. Some survivors described their harrowing escapes by rigging up disguises, sneaking to safety with locals, and in at least one case, running for his life with plastic explosives strapped around his neck. That man was Stephen McFaul, who -- according to his brother Brian -- was among a group of hostages who had been blindfolded, gagged and then packed into five Jeeps on Thursday, during Algerian forces' first offensive. An explosion ""wiped out"" four of the vehicles, while McFaul's vehicle crashed. He was able to get out and, eventually, contact his family. ""I haven't seen my mother move as fast in all my life, and my mother smile as much, hugging each other,"" Brian McFaul of Belfast, Northern Ireland, said upon his family hearing his brother was safe. ""... You couldn't describe the feeling."" Al Qaeda-linked group offered prisoner-hostage exchange . A spokesman for Moktar Belmoktar, a longtime jihadist who leads the Brigade of the Masked Ones -- a militant group associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- reportedly offered to free U.S. hostages in exchange for two prisoners. Behind the group claiming responsibility for the attack and kidnappings, he is known for seizing hostages and has long been targeted by French counterterrorism forces. The prisoners are Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, who orchestrated the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman jailed in the United States on terrorism charges, the spokesman said in an interview with a private Mauritanian news agency. Nuland rejected the offer, restating U.S. policy of not negotiating with terrorists. Opinion: Algeria situation is a wake-up call for the U.S. CNN's Barbara Starr, Per Nyberg, Dan Rivers, Greg Botelho, Tricia Escobedo, Josh Rubin, Joe Sutton, Mitra Mobasherat, Saskya Vandoorne, Laura Perez Maestro, Saad Abedine, Elise Labott and Tim Lister contributed to this report, as did journalists Peter Taggart from Belfast and Said Ben Ali from Algiers.","Two Americans unaccounted for, senior U.S. official says .

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- A Texas woman who was sentenced to prison for stabbing her husband more than 200 times may have a chance at probation as a second jury reconsiders her sentence. Once dubbed the ""blue-eyed butcher"" in news accounts, Susan Wright is serving a 25-year sentence for stabbing her husband, Jeffrey, to death in 2003. During her murder trial the following year, Harris County District Attorneys alleged that Wright tied her husband to their bed during a seduction, dripped hot wax on his body and killed him. An appellate court upheld Wright's conviction of first-degree murder but set aside her sentence, finding that her attorneys failed to do their job in the penalty phase of the case. The mother of two from Houston faces a wide range of sentencing options, from probation to life in prison. The decision rests in the hands of a new 12-person jury. Wright's appellate attorney, Brian Wice, argued that her original team ignored crucial witnesses who would have supported Wright's claim of abuse at the hands of her husband. A psychiatrist who treated Wright after the stabbing, an expert on Battered Woman Syndrome, and a former girlfriend of the victim who had pressed assault charges against him were all known and available to the defense but inexplicably never testified, Wice argued in his appeal. Wice attributed his client's sentence to rookie defense attorneys who were ""steamrolled"" by a veteran prosecutor. Former Assistant District Attorney Kelly Siegler, who tried the case, propelled the trial into the media spotlight with a dramatic courtroom re-enactment of the stabbing on the Wrights' marital bed. Straddling a tied-down colleague on the actual bloodstained mattress, weapon in hand, Siegler demonstrated the State's version of the killing. Prosecutors took a more measured approach this week, avoiding sexual innuendo but maintaining that the victim was tied to the bed during the attack. Harris County Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Dwayne Wolf and lead investigator Mark Reynolds both testified that apparent ligatures were found on the victim's wrists. Explicit photographs of the victim's wound-riddled body were displayed for jurors, with defense attorney Jonathan Munier describing the man as a ""leaking sieve"" from injures ranging from his head to his genitals and legs. Wolf also said cocaine was found in the victim's system, and several witnesses testified to his occasional drug use, which defense attorney say may have rendered him aggressive. Wright testified in 2004 her husband regularly abused her and that she experienced a break with reality when the stabbing occurred. Prosecution witnesses this week also testified to the defendant's apparent clean-up of the scene and elaborate lies during the six days leading up to the discovery of her husband's body. The 34-year-old was found buried in the backyard of the couple's home. The family dog had partially unearthed the remains and chewed off much of the victim's left hand. In the defense opening statement Friday, defense attorney Juan Guerra told jurors he would call experts on domestic violence. Wright, flanked by new attorneys, cried often during the testimony this week but smiled at the mention of her two children, now in the care of her former in-laws. The defense case will continue Monday.","Susan Wright was sentenced to 25 years for stabbing husband more than 200 times .

"(CNN) -- Three Ohio Amish men remained in police custody Monday after allegedly assaulting other members of their local community in part by forcibly cutting off hair and beards -- a particularly egregious offense in Amish society. Lester Mullet, 26, Johnny Mullet, 38, and Levi Miller, 53, were arrested last Friday, according to Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla. Additional arrests are expected, Abdalla said. Four alleged attacks have taken place since September 6, Abdalla said. The three men are accused of breaking into multiple homes and inflicting a series of cuts and bruises while forcibly cutting facial and other hair from men, women, and children. The attacks, according to Abdalla, were instigated by an extreme Amish splinter group led by Lester and Johnny Mullet's father -- Bishop Sam Mullet. ""The leader of this group ... -- I call it a cult -- was shunned from his faith some years ago,"" Abdalla said in regard to Bishop Mullet. ""He basically thumbed his nose"" at others. ""Nothing moves in this (particular) Amish community unless (Bishop Mullet) says it moves,"" Abdalla said. Amish men typically grow beards in accordance with their religious practice, according to Donald Kraybill, an Amish scholar at Elizabethtown College. Amish women often do not cut their hair, Kraybill said. ""Amish-on-Amish violence is extremely rare,"" Kraybill said. ""This is very odd and clearly outlier behavior, an aberration in Amish society."" This ""is a difficult, terrible crime,"" Abdalla said. ""We are doing everything we can do.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least nine people died after three rockets were fired toward an airport in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, authorities said Saturday. The Bacha Khan International Airport was cordoned off after the rocket fire, senior police official Imran Shahid said. Syed Naveed Qamar, Pakistan's defense minister, said on Geo News five attackers were killed. Qamar said the target could be an airforce base, which is adjacent to the airport. Both the airport and the air base have the same entrance. Mian Iftikhar Hussain, information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said after the attackers fired the rockets they tried but failed to drive an explosives-laden vehicle into the airport. The vehicle struck the airport's outer wall, blew up and killed the militants. Other than the attackers, four civilians were also killed, Shahid said. He said 35 people were injured as well. Two of the rockets landed inside the airport and the other struck outside the facility. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility of the attack. Taliban official Ehsanullah Ehsan said their target was in fact the air base. ""We have planned more attacks on Pakistani forces and its installation as it works to please the USA,"" Ehsan said. Peshawar is near Pakistan's volatile tribal region. Militants have a strong presence in that region, which borders Afghanistan.","Many people were hurt .

"(CNN) -- China's National People's Congress (NPC) meets every year and brings about 3,000 national delegates together in Beijing's Great Hall of the People to discuss government reports, pass legislation and formalize appointments of government officials. The NPC is constitutionally the highest organ of government power in China although it has long been considered a rubber-stamp parliament. It passes virtually every measure, resolution and law put forward by the government or the Chinese Communist Party. Since the early 1990s, the NPC has passed several laws aimed at building up a legal system and has sought to promulgate a ""rule by law"" rather than a ""rule by men"" -- an attempt to steer the party away from its Maoist structures to fit more closely the international norms that govern the world's capital markets. The raft of new legislation passed at the NPC includes labor laws, securities laws, corporation laws, banking laws and environmental protection laws. The body also has the power to elect, dismiss and reassign local and central government officials, including the state president, the premier, top judges and ministers. Despite this, elections are carefully choreographed, and typically there is only one candidate for one position. Token disapproval or dissent is usually shown by means of abstentions rather than straight ""no"" votes. Xi Jinping and a new, younger crop of leaders are set to lead the Communist Party and the government over the next 10 years. The Communist Party is due for the reshuffle in the fall and the government will follow suit in spring 2013. Barring any big surprises, current vice premier Li Keqiang, a protege of President Hu, is set to replace Premier Wen Jiabao, who will retire. When China's leaders convene, they will have a wide range of problems to tackle. Among them: . -- How to keep the economy growing at a fast enough rate (the IMF currently estimates growth at 8.2%) at a time when the global economy is in recession. Much of the Communist Party's legitimacy is predicated on economic growth which mitigates unemployment and social tensions. -- How quickly China can shift its economic growth model from manufacturing and exports to domestic consumption and services. -- How to bridge the growing divide between the rich and the poor to maintain social stability. -- How to keep these problems in check without significantly changing the political system and how to deal with pressure for political reforms. -- How to keep ethnic unrest in places like Xinjiang and Tibet in check. -- How to deal with the growing desire in Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong for more freedom while at the same time maintaining China's claim of sovereignty over them. Hong Kong is likely to be in focus this congress because of its upcoming elections. -- How to manage its growing economic and political strength overseas without triggering a backlash among other countries, especially its neighbors and the United States. Following three decades of economic reform, China is now an extremely complex and diverse country. Problems of regional rivalries, corruption, environmental degradation, joblessness, fiscal shakiness, massive in-migration and social tension are now visible features of China's political and social landscape. What the CCP will have to face is that the old way of governing -- rule by edict over a submissive and poorly informed population -- is no longer working. More and more Chinese are informed through the power of the media, particularly through microblogging sites like Weibo which are now a valuable litmus of popular public opinion. More than 500 million Chinese are internet users, and the country's microbloggers are believed to number more than 200 million users. More and more Chinese are unafraid to air their grievances, leading to thousands of ""mass incidents"" or spontaneous protests every year sparked by corruption, environmental damage, official abuse and land grabs.","China's National People's Congress meets every year .

"Chatham, England (CNN) -- The history of journalism is not, as supporters of official regulation pretend, a long march toward state involvement. Campaigners for a free press have fought for centuries against state interference. Their certainty that journalism sanitized by official regulators is incompatible with liberty is recognized by such trivial instruments of democracy as the U.S. Constitution. The phone-hacking scandal has exposed the depths some journalists plumbed in pursuit of saleable stories. But it has done nothing to undermine this truth: regulation underpinned by statute would squander the fruits of struggle and betray the cause of progress. Should the press be more regulated? Share your views . The Hacked Off campaign claims to have discovered alchemy by which state underpinning of press regulation can be rendered safe. In fact it parades an oxymoron: independent regulation backed by statute. It is offensive to the democratic principle that a free press is a crucial guardian of ordinary citizens' rights. Worse; it would do nothing to protect the victims of phone hacking. Why UK's shamed newspapers need regulating . The Leveson Inquiry has made stark one conclusion that is profoundly inconvenient to proponents of statutory underpinning. Richard Shillito of Farrer & Co., expresses it well: ""All or virtually all the egregious behavior which has given rise to calls for better press regulation is either actionable or contrary to the criminal law. Breach of privacy, copyright, confidence, harassment, data theft, forgery, hacking of computers and phones, contempt of court/Parliament -- these are all covered by existing law."" So, one powerful argument against state-sponsored regulation of the press is that appropriate remedies -- and penalties -- exist already for all of the offenses that have been discussed at the Leveson Inquiry. Journalism is subject to more than 50 laws ranging from the Official Secrets Act (1911) to the Bribery Act (2010) and including libel laws that have made this country destination of choice for ""libel tourists."" So, it is reasonable to ask what Hacked Off really wants. In fact its supporters have made that clear. They yearn for journalism in which the public interest is defined without any reference to what the public is interested in: reporting that would impose on the majority the tastes of a narrow cultural and intellectual elite. In the words of Mick Hume, my fellow campaigner for press freedom, ""[Their] demand for 'ethical journalism' is essentially a cultural manifesto masquerading as morality."" I prefer liberty. Why should Britain have press regulation at all? America has none, and its newspaper culture is committed to ethical reporting. But there will be stronger regulation. The Press Complaints Commission's failure to investigate effectively hacking at the News of the World -- compounded by its criticism of The Guardian for pursuing a story of luminous importance -- guaranteed it. But Lord Justice Leveson has no mandate to impose state-sanctioned regulation. He has responsibility without power: Government and parliament must decide. They should not be tempted by a solution three Royal Commissions since 1945 have rejected. A sanctimonious alliance of celebrities and illiberal academics urges them in that direction. They would be utterly wrong to take it. State involvement in the regulation of journalism destroys public trust. Before the internet, newspapers were trusted most when they stood apart from the state and spoke on behalf of their readers. Today the internet is cherished for the same reason. And, cherish it or not, pragmatists should note that it makes statutory regulation of newspapers an absurdly old-fashioned idea. Supporters of state-regulation castigate its opponents as ""first amendment fundamentalists."" They mean that we support the U.S. Constitution's guarantee that government may make no law abridging the freedom of the press. I believe Britain should adopt a comparable guarantee. State supervision of newspapers offends their readers and journalism serves democracy best when its values are those the public consider decent. Regulation underpinned by statute might satisfy a short-term appetite to avenge the suffering of innocent victims. It would please the few misguided MPs who still imagine that the press was wrong to shine light into the murky world of parliamentary expenses. But no matter how benignly intended or carefully designed it would have consequences worse than any good it could do. As Christopher Meyer, former British Ambassador to the United States, explained to the Leveson Inquiry: ""Once you allow the state into this area, whatever the best intentions may have been, you are by definition standing on the top of a slippery slope. Twenty, 25 years later, things change, politics change. It is quite possible a less permissive and liberal state, less conscious of our freedoms, might try to take advantage of that legislation to do things that would be offensive to the principle of freedom of expression."" Soldiers call it mission creep, and statutory regulation would not just provide a tool for misguided politicians at home. Authoritarian rulers everywhere would exploit the slightest hint of state involvement in the regulation of the British press. ""Look,"" they would gloat, ""The mother of democracy understands the need for the state to ensure that journalists behave. We agree."" Plainly authoritarians of right and left share a desire to regulate what the electorate may read. Shocking is the possibility that sincere liberals may soon find themselves tainted by an outcome they should despise. Were the superb work the Guardian did to expose phone hacking to result in state supervised regulation of newspapers, the injustice would be grotesque. An outcome that great newspaper deplores in every corner of the world cannot be a proper conclusion to its campaign. I do not forecast an apocalypse, just a slow descent into controlled speech alien to the British tradition. It may be humanely directed, but the ultimate price of a statutory backstop to regulation of the newspaper industry is a docile press. Far better to cherish raucous, impertinent journalism that can speak truth to power on behalf of its readers and entertain them enough to secure their loyalty. A few individuals who already have our collective sympathy and who have received or will receive richly deserved compensation might enjoy the spectacle of state-sanctioned regulation. We would all be losers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tim Luckhurst.","Tim Luckhurst: Regulation is offensive to principle that free press is guardian of citizens' rights .

"Rome (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, meeting with allies, kept up pressure on Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Thursday, demanding that he ""cease attacks and the threat of attacks"" against rebels who oppose his rule. Gadhafi must withdraw all forces from rebel cities they have entered, restore services to those cities, and allow humanitarian aid in, Clinton insisted. U.S. and NATO bombing of his forces will continue until he meets the terms, she said. ""As long as Gadhafi continues to attack his citizens, we will continue to strike his forces,"" she said. ""It is time for the violence to end. It is time for Gadhafi to go. It is time for a democratic transition to begin,"" she said. The United States is also looking into ways to help the rebels financially, including seizing Gadhafi assets and using them to aid Libya's people, and helping the Transitional National Council to sell oil, Clinton said. Clinton was speaking in Rome, where international powers held their second high-level meeting on the Libyan crisis. The Libyan government, according to state TV, said financing the rebels from frozen assets would be equivalent to theft. Congress is being consulted on the possible use of a portion of the $30 billion in assets, two senior State Department officials said. It was not clear whether any of the money would go directly to the opposition government. European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton said the Rome meeting ""underlined the international community's unity and determination to bring the Libyan crisis to a quick and satisfactory conclusion. With the humanitarian situation deteriorating, time is of the essence. Gadhafi must end his attacks against his own people and respect human rights."" Also Thursday, the International Organization for Migration said it was suspending its passenger ships between the two rebel towns of Benghazi and Misrata after Gadhafi forces shelled the port in Misrata Wednesday, killing at least five people. IOM media director Jean Philippe Chauzy said operations would be suspended until the organization puts in place a ""better evacuation plan."" The IOM never again wants to experience what happened on Wednesday, he said. No one was injured on the IOM-chartered boat in Misrata at the time of the shelling, the agency said. Medecins Sans Frontieres, the international medical humanitarian group (known as Doctors Without Borders in English), said a 22-member team is delivering surgical and medical care to the wounded at two hospitals and a clinic. The organization has donated more than 25 tons of medicine and medical equipment, it said in a statement Thursday. Rebels, meanwhile, told CNN that they have taken the southern city of al-Koufra, with Gadhafi forces gone except for a small group on its western edge. The two sides have exchanged control over al-Koufra over the past two months. CNN could not independently verify the claim. Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary William Hague ordered two Libyan diplomats to leave the country for ""actions contrary to the interests of the UK,"" the Foreign Office announced Thursday. He gave them a week to get out, starting Wednesday, the Foreign Office statement said. The British Ministry of Defence and NATO said Thursday their forces had been engaging Gadhafi's troops over the past several days, destroying ammunition dumps, surface-to-air batteries, and other targets. As for the Rome meeting, Hague said the international community is ""resolved to continue to take action"" on Libya, and ""more countries took part and reiterated that Gadhafi should go.""  Participants also agreed to help the Transitional National Council with short term financial support with the establishment of the Temporary Financial Mechanism, which was suggested in the first meeting in Doha, Qatar, according to a statement released at the conclusion of the talks. The diplomatic and military moves came soon after the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court said in a report there are ""reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed and continue being committed in Libya."" The report highlighted the alleged commission of rape by Gadhafi's government, as well as the deportation or forcible transfer of citizens during the civil war that continues to rage in that country. It also noted war crimes, including intentionally directing attacks against civilians not participating in the fighting. ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo issued a statement saying he will soon request arrest warrants against three individuals who are ""most responsible for the crimes committed."" The individuals were not named. It is not clear if he plans to file charges against anyone on the rebel side, though the report mentioned ""alleged war crimes as well as other crimes against humanity"" appear to have been committed by ""different parties."" He warned when he opened the probe two months ago that the rebels are subject to international law just as Gadhafi's forces are. This is the first time the International Criminal Court has begun investigating possible crimes against humanity as they were occurring in wartime, Moreno-Ocampo said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, on a visit to Bulgaria, said, ""I fully support the principle that whoever and whenever there is violation of human rights and international humanitarian law, those people should be accountable and go to justice."" NATO began bombing Libya on March 19, after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary, short of invasion, to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule.

"(CNN) -- Government shelling of the seaside town of Misrata resumed Thursday afternoon, with heavy artillery and mortars targeting residential areas, killing 10 people, a member of the medical committee of the Misrata Council told CNN. Also Thursday, rebels retook the border area of Dehaiba/Wazin after forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi had taken it earlier in the day, a witness said. The witness, Yousef Gaigi, said about 100 rebel vehicles equipped with assault rifles and antiaircraft weapons drove from the Libyan city Zintan to the border area, where they clashed with pro-government forces. ""The fight resulted in many casualties,"" he said, without citing a number. Gaigi said the pro-Gadhafi forces then fled to the Tunisian side of the border and handed their weapons to the Tunisian army. The Tunisian Defense Ministry said the soldiers were taken farther north to the border at Ras Ajdir and sent back to Libya. Asked whether the Tunisians had returned the Libyans' weapons, a ministry official said, ""It's possible."" Earlier Thursday, the Tunisian Foreign Ministry had expressed ""deep concern"" over the military escalation near the crossing its border with Libyan and demanded that the Libyan government ""put an end to these violations,"" according to the state-run Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP). The incidents occurred a day after the carnage in Libya continued to mount: on Wednesday, pro-government forces launched the heaviest shelling yet on the port of Misrata, much of which appeared to be a wasteland, rebels said. Also Wednesday, a NATO airstrike on Misrata killed 11 rebel fighters and wounded two others, witnesses told a reporter, who saw the bodies. From the time NATO began its operation on March 31 until Tuesday, the organization had conducted 3,981 sorties, of which 1,658 were strike sorties, according to an update issued Wednesday. NATO is leading an international military operation in Libya that includes airstrikes targeting Gadhafi's military resources. It is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing any means necessary -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians. Misrata, the third-largest city in the North African country, has been hemmed in on three sides by Gadhafi's forces. Though rebels said they had gained control of the city's center and had pushed government forces outside the city, they said Gadhafi's forces were continuing to attack Misrata with heavy weaponry. The port has served as a crucial route of escape and as a lifeline to humanitarian aid.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- NATO aircraft targeted warships overnight, striking eight of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's vessels in Tripoli's seaport, the organization said Friday morning. A Libyan government official said the targets included commercial vessels as well as military ones. ""All NATO's targets are military in nature and are directly linked to the Gadhafi regime's systematic attacks on the Libyan people,"" said Rear Adm. Russell Harding, deputy commander of Operation Unified Protector. ""Given the escalating use of naval assets, NATO had no choice but to take decisive action to protect the civilian population of Libya and NATO forces at sea."" In a statement, NATO said the attack occurred after two weeks of escalating use of government maritime forces that had disrupted the flow of humanitarian assistance. All the vessels targeted were naval warships with no civilian utility, said Harding. But a Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area said the commercial port, not the nearby military port, was hit. From the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area, it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit. The port's general manager, Mohammed Ahmed Rashed, told reporters that six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel, which had been in dock for maintenance. The port remained operational, he said. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called the attack a ""clear attempt to bring the nation to its knees,"" and said the port serves as the main entry point for food and other critical supplies into the country. ""The nation will starve,"" he said. Still, though the port was in disarray, the damage did not appear major, he said. Ibrahim's claims came as President Barack Obama, addressing a global audience, condemned the use of force against Arab Spring protesters by longtime allies and adversaries alike. ""Obama is still delusional,"" Ibrahim said. ""He believes the lies that his own government is spreading around the world and his own media is spreading around the world. They have not proved one single charge against us and they refuse to investigate us."" He added, ""It's not Obama who decides whether Moammar Gadhafi leaves Libya or not. It's the Libyan people who decide their future."" The report of the attack came shortly after at least three explosions could be heard in the city. A government official said five airstrikes had targeted the port and the police academy was also hit on Thursday, during which NATO jets could be seen been flying overhead throughout the day. Libyan state-run television reported the strikes with a ""breaking news"" font that said, ""Military source: Residential and military locations in Tripoli are currently being shelled by NATO forces."" Earlier Thursday, crowds of Libyans took to the streets of Tripoli, honking horns and dancing in the streets in support of the country's leader, Moammar Gadhafi. More than 100 people outside the headquarters of state television chanted ""God, Moammar and Libya only"" and other pro-Gadhafi and anti-rebel slogans. The demonstrations were sparked, apparently, in response to state-run television reports that parts of the rebel capital Benghazi were ""rejecting the colonialists and their followers,"" as the government describes NATO and the rebels. A group of journalists, including a CNN team, was taken by government minders to see the celebrations in Tripoli. Among the crowds composed predominantly of young men were a number of families -- including fathers carrying children on their shoulders. One woman, who brought her 10-year-old-daughter, carried a portrait of the Libyan leader and said they were celebrating their country being united again. Many then drove toward Tripoli's Green Square singing and honking their horns, waving Libya's green flag and portraits of Gadhafi. But CNN journalists in Benghazi saw no indications of counter-revolutionary uprisings or protests there. And the National Transitional Council denied government claims that pro-Gadhafi forces had seized control of the city. And residents of Benghazi said they had not seen or heard of pro-Gadhafi rallies there. Two months ago, Gadhafi loyalists in Tripoli erupted in similar cheers when state media incorrectly reported that Tobruk and Benghazi had fallen to government troops. Gadhafi has been fighting to keep control of his country in the face of an uprising that has led to a number of key cities falling into rebel control. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court this week requested a warrant for Gadhafi's arrest on charges of crimes against humanity.

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) -- The United States and China have not offered to go far enough to combat climate change, a top European Union official said as a major international summit on the subject opened Monday. Final negotiations at the conference ""will be mostly about what will be delivered from the United States and from China,"" said Andreas Carlgren, the environment minister of Sweden, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. The two countries ""together cover half of the world's emissions,"" Carlgren said. ""It will be absolutely decisive what they can deliver."" He pressed U.S. President Barack Obama to deliver more than he promised in a statement in the run-up to the conference. ""It would be somewhat astonishing if Obama would come here and deliver ... just what was promised in last week's press release,"" Carlgren said. What is at stake in Copenhagen? Obama had been planning to attend the early stages of the Copenhagen summit that could lay the groundwork for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions well into the century. But the White House announced last week that he would come at the end instead. Jonathan Pershing, U.S. deputy special envoy for climate change, defended Obama's late attendance, saying the country's goals extended beyond the summit. ""The president has put a remarkable amount on the table,"" he told a news conference in Copenhagen. ""What the president has put on the table is a commitment for the United States to move forward: a commitment on emissions, a commitment on financing, a commitment on engagement -- what we need to now do is see how these negotiations proceed."" Pershing rejected EU criticism saying U.S. goals for reducing emission went far beyond those offered by the European bloc. He added: ""What the United States has put on the table is a trajectory that is not only consistent with, but meets the criteria of a robust scientific outcome. ""We don't just have a 2020 number, or a 2025 number, or a 2030, although we have all of those, we're moving towards a 2050 number and a trajectory with information in every single intervening year, and we're moving towards an 80 percent reduction which is what the science is calling for. ""We look to the EU for a similar kind of long term trajectory."" Obama's initial plan to attend only the beginning of the conference was criticized by some, including the environmental group Greenpeace, which said it is more important that he be there at week's end. ""President Obama needs to be there at the same time as all the other world leaders -- December 18,"" said Mike Townsley, a Greenpeace spokesman. ""This is when he is needed to get the right agreement."" The stakes could not be higher, the head of the conference said as it opened. ""Within two weeks from Monday, governments must give their adequate response to the urgent challenge of climate change,"" said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Climate Change Conference. ""Negotiators now have the clearest signal ever from world leaders to craft solid proposals to implement rapid action."" China announced last month that Premier Wen Jiabao would attend to ""fully demonstrate the great importance the Chinese government attaches to this issue, as well as the political will of the Chinese government to cooperate with the international community,"" spokesman Qin Gang said in November. China's State Council has announced plans ""to reduce the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit"" of gross domestic product in 2020 by 40 percent to 45 percent, compared with its 2005 level, state-run media reported last month. Obama is prepared to offer a goal of the United States reducing emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, the White House has said. The White House also reiterated his goal of reducing U.S. emissions by 83 percent by 2050. In a statement Sunday, De Boer laid out the three layers of action on which he would like governments to agree during the summit: immediate action on climate change, ambitious commitments to cut and limit emissions, and ""a long-term shared vision on a low-emissions future for all."" Obama has discussed the status of climate change negotiations with the leaders of Australia, Britain, France and Germany, the White House said Friday. ""There appears to be an emerging consensus that a core element of the Copenhagen accord should be to mobilize $10 billion a year by 2012 to support adaptation and mitigation in developing countries, particularly the most vulnerable and least developed countries that could be destabilized by the impacts of climate change,"" it said. The climate talks aim to strike a deal on a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 pact that has legally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The United States never ratified it, though more than 200 nations did.

"(CNN) -- The second inaugural address is always more difficult than the first. When a president-elect first steps onto the national stage, he still enjoys a certain degree of innocence and hope. Americans are waiting to see if the new president will be different. When a new president delivers his speech, voters don't yet have a record that might make them cynical. But by the second term, voters are familiar, and often tired, with the occupant of the White House. Even though they liked him more than his opponents, the president has usually been through some pretty tough battles and his limitations have been exposed. It becomes much harder to deliver big promises, when the people watching have a much clearer sense of your limitations and of the strength of your opponents. So President Barack Obama faces a big test when he appears before the nation Monday. Opinion: Presidents shouldn't swear in on a Bible . Obama now is Washington, and no longer someone who will be able to shake up the way Washington works. Voters believe that Congress is dysfunctional and have little confidence that legislators will respond to his proposals. Overseas, the instability and violence in the Middle East has shaken the confidence of many Americans that Obama can achieve the kind of transformative change he promised back in 2009. Obama, who is a student of history, can look back at some past second inaugural addresses if he wants guidance. Three of the best of these addresses offer a roadmap. Abraham Lincoln, March 4, 1865: The strongest was from Lincoln, who gave his talk amid the brutality of the Civil War but chose to stress the theme of healing and unity, Lincoln gave a masterful performance that offered inspiration and encouragement for the reunification of the nation. Lincoln famously said: ""With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."" Rather than boasting of military victory or threatening Southern forces, he stepped outside the battle to offer the nation, as a whole, the path forward. Woodrow Wilson, March 5, 1917: Although Wilson had run on a campaign to keep America out of world war, he was aware that such intervention was inevitable. During his second inaugural address, Wilson took the opportunity to start preparing the nation for what was about to come. He told America to think about the global responsibilities it had to accept, even if much of the nation was not prepared to do so. ""We are provincials no longer,"" he said, ""The tragic events of the thirty months of vital turmoil which we have just passed have made us citizens of the world. There can be no turning back."" Opinion: Why 'Hail to the Chief' remains unsung . Franklin Roosevelt, January 20, 1937: Roosevelt gave a rousing performance that outlined the fundamental vision which shaped the wide array of policies he had put forward in his first term. While many people had criticized FDR for lacking any ideology and for being a pragmatist without principle, in his second address he explained the rationale behind his actions: ""I see millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children. I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished."" For Democrats, the speech remains a powerful defense of government and the rationale behind his program. To replicate some of this success, Obama will need to figure out how to inspire a nation that is frustrated by the gridlock of Washington and the laggard state of the economy and worried about instability overseas. Obama can learn from all three of these presidents. Like Wilson, he can talk to Americans about goals they should aspire to achieve, ways in which the country can accept new obligations in a changing world. Like Lincoln, he can urge the nation to move beyond the discord and division that have characterized political debate in the past four years. Finally, like Roosevelt, he can use his speech to provide some of the justification and outlook that has shaped his policies. This would undercut the ability of Republicans to define his policies for him, as has been the case for much of his first term, and motivate supporters who have often felt that Obama remained too much of a mystery. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Second term inaugural addresses are always a challenge .

"(CNN) -- Operation Serval, France's swift military intervention to roll back advances made by Jihadist elements who had hijacked a separatist movement in northern Mali, could be a turning point in the ex-colonialist's relationship with Africa. It is not, after all, every day that you hear a senior official of the African Union (AU) refer to a former European colonial power in Africa as ""a brotherly nation,"" as Ambroise Niyonsaba, the African Union's special representative in Ivory Coast, described France on 14 January, while hailing the European nation's military strikes in Mali. France's persistent meddling to bolster puppet regimes or unseat inconvenient ones was often the cause of much outrage among African leaders and intellectuals. But by robustly taking on the Islamist forces that for many months now have imposed a regime of terror in northern Mali, France is doing exactly what African governments would like to have done. This is because the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), Ansar Dine and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are a far greater threat to many African states than they ever would be to France or Europe. See also: What's behind Mali instability? Moreover, the main underlying issues that led to this situation -- the separatist rebellion by Mali's Tuareg, under the banner of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), who seized the northern half of the country and declared it independent of Mali shortly after a most ill-timed military coup on 22 March 2012 -- is anathema to the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Successful separatism by an ethnic minority, it is believed, would only encourage the emergence of more separatist movements in a continent where many of the countries were cobbled together from disparate groups by Europeans not so long ago. But the foreign Islamists who had been allies to the Tuaregs at the start of their rebellion had effectively sidelined the MNLA by July last year, and have since been exercising tomcatting powers over the peasants in the area, to whom the puritanical brand of Islam being promoted by the Islamists is alien. ECOWAS, which is dominated by Nigeria -- formerly France's chief hegemonic foe in West Africa -- in August last year submitted a note verbale with a ""strategic concept"" to the U.N. Security Council, detailing plans for an intervention force to defeat the Islamists in Mali and reunify the country. ECOWAS wanted the U.N. to bankroll the operation, which would include the deployment a 3,245-strong force -- to which Nigeria (694), Togo (581), Niger (541) and Senegal (350) would be the biggest contributors -- at a cost of $410 million a year. The note stated that the objective of the Islamists in northern Mali was to ""create a safe haven"" in that country from which to coordinate ""continental terrorist networks, including AQIM, MUJAO, Boko Haram [in Nigeria] and Al-Shabaab [in Somalia]."" Despite compelling evidence of the threat the Islamists pose to international peace and security, the U.N. has not been able to agree on funding what essentially would be a military offensive. U.N. Security Council resolution 2085, passed on 20 December last year, only agreed to a voluntary contribution and the setting up of a trust fund, and requested the secretary-general ""develop and refine options within 30 days"" in this regard. The deadline should be 20 January. See also: Six reasons events in Mali matter . It is partly because of this U.N. inaction that few in Africa would label the French action in Mali as another neo-colonial mission creep. If the Islamists had been allowed to capture the very strategic town of SevarÃ©, as they seemed intent on doing, they would have captured the only airstrip in Mali (apart from the airport in Bamako) capable of handling heavy cargo planes, and they would have been poised to attack the more populated south of the country. Those Africans who would be critical of the French are probably stunned to embarrassment: Africa's weakness has, once again, been exposed by the might of a foreign power. Watch video: French troops welcomed in Mali . Africans, however, can perhaps take consolation in the fact that the current situation in Mali was partially created by the NATO action in Libya in 2010, which France spearheaded. A large number of the well-armed Islamists and Tuareg separatists had fought in the forces of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and then left to join the MNLA in northern Mali after Gadhafi fell. They brought with them advanced weapons, including shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles from Libya; and two new Jihadist terrorist groups active in northern Mali right now, Ansar Dine and MUJAO, were formed out of these forces. Many African states had an ambivalent attitude towards Gadhafi, but few rejoiced when he was ousted and killed in the most squalid condition. A number of African countries, Nigeria included, have started to deploy troops in Mali alongside the French, and ECOWAS has stated the objective as the complete liberation of the north from the Islamists. The Islamists are clearly not a pushover; though they number between 2,000 and 3,000 they are battle-hardened and fanatically driven, and will likely hold on for some time to come. The question now is: what happens after, as is almost certain, France begins to wind down its forces, leaving the African troops in Mali? Nigeria, which almost single-handedly funded previous ECOWAS interventions (in Liberia and Sierra Leone in the 1990s, costing billions of dollars and hundreds of Nigerian troops), has been reluctant to fund such expensive missions since it became democratic. See also: Nigerians waiting for 'African Spring' Its civilian regimes have to be more accountable to their citizens than the military regimes of the 1990s, and Nigeria has pressing domestic challenges. Foreign military intervention is no longer popular in the country, though the links between the northern Mali Islamists and the destructive Boko Haram could be used as a strategic justification for intervention in Mali. The funding issue, however, will become more and more urgent in the coming weeks and months, and the U.N. must find a sustainable solution beyond a call for voluntary contributions by member states.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court on Tuesday dismissed blasphemy charges against Rimsha Masih, a Christian teenager whose case prompted international outrage. ""She is a free woman, like any ordinary citizen,"" said Abdul Hameed Rana, one of Rimsha's lawyers. The high court in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad found that the accusations against her were legally unsound, he said. Read more: Setback for Pakistani teen facing blasphemy charges . The court's decision follows weeks of uncertainty for Rimsha and her family, who were forced to go into hiding because of the furor surrounding the case. ""We welcome the courts ruling made under considerable pressure and international scrutiny,"" said Mustafa Qadri, Amnesty International's Pakistan researcher. ""This shows that law enforcement and justice officials in Pakistan are capable of dealing with high profile and dangerous cases when they show the will to do so."" Pakistan's blasphemy laws ""don't help protect religious harmony,"" he said. ""The problem is that in law and in practice, this is a threat to all Pakistanis, not just Christians, not just minorities groups."" Rimsha's ordeal began in August when she was arrested over allegations she had burned pages of the Quran, Islam's holy book, for cooking fuel. She denied the charges, which carried the possible sentence of life in prison. Confusion still surrounds the events of the day when Rimsha was arrested. The accusations against her were made by a neighbor, who shouted in protest, drawing a crowd that grew angry over the allegations that pages of the Quran had been burned. Read more: Muslim cleric framed girl in Pakistan blasphemy case . Some residents of the Islamabad neighborhood said the teenager was beaten. Others said she ran back home and locked herself inside. When police arrived, they arrested her. Her detention stirred up religious tensions in the predominantly Muslim country. It also generated fierce criticism of Pakistani authorities and renewed debate over the nation's blasphemy laws. Human rights activists attacked the decision to put Rimsha into the adult criminal justice system, noting she was believed to be around 14 years old. She was later released on bail and her case was transferred to a juvenile court. The situation took a dramatic twist in September when police arrested a local imam over allegations he had framed Rimsha. According to police, witnesses said they had seen the Muslim cleric, Khalid Jadoon Chishti, tear pages out of a copy of the Quran and add them to the bag of ashes being cited as evidence against Rimsha. That case became more complicated last month when Chishti's lawyers said that three of the witnesses had recanted their statements at a bail hearing. The case against Chishti will continue in district court following the high court ruling Tuesday, according to Rana, the lawyer for Rimsha. Explainer: Pakistan's blasphemy laws . Pakistan's blasphemy laws were first instituted to keep peace between religions. But they have been criticized by human rights advocates, who say the laws enable legal discrimination against religious minorities. There have been about 1,400 blasphemy cases since the laws were first enacted in 1986, according to Human Rights Watch. There are more than 15 cases of people on death row for blasphemy in Pakistan, and 52 people have been killed while facing trial for the charge, according to the organization. Rimsha and her family spoke to CNN in September from an undisclosed location after she was released on bail. The teen denied that she defiled the Quran. She said she was happy to be with her family, but feared for her life. ""I'm scared,"" she said by phone. ""I'm afraid of anyone who might kill us."" Now that her case has been dismissed, it still remains unclear what kind of life she might be able to have, given the accusations she faced. Aid groups in the United States, Italy and Canada have offered the teen and her family a home outside Pakistan, a family representative said. But she has said she wants to stay in her home country.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The head of Libya's opposition government told reporters Saturday he welcomed a call Friday by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for Moammar Gadhafi to step down. Medvedev's statement, echoing the stance of American and European leaders, appeared to indicate a closing diplomatic window for the longtime Libyan strongman. The chairman of the National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, said he has offered amnesty to Gadhafi loyalists who defect before the demise of the regime, but reiterated that there will be ""no negotiation for any solution until Gadhafi's departure."" Once that happens, elections and a constitutional referendum will be held within a year, Jailil said in the opposition stronghold of Benghazi. In an interview with CNN, Jalil said the council had sold a shipment of oil to China for $160 million. The confirmation of the sale is expected to buttress the political and economic credibility of the fledgling rebel power. The leader said the movement has a ""financial crisis"" and is seeking loans from outside the country. The council is happy for political support, but will not ask Russia for arms or economic aid, Jalil said. The unrest in Libya has persisted for months as opposition members demand an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. Jalil marked the 100th day of the nation's civil war. ""We see victories emerging at both national and international levels,"" he said. ""We should celebrate what our heroic sons have accomplished in Misrata and the Nafusa mountains, as well as applaud the wide international support for our revolution."" Meanwhile, a series of morning explosions rocked the capital of Tripoli on Saturday, including blasts at a compound belonging to Gadhafi and one at a nearby tribal compound, a government official said. The official said one morning strike occurred on Bab bin Ghashir, a tribal compound near Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound, where the other strikes occurred. The official believed the strikes were NATO attacks. No casualties were reported. Morning strikes in Tripoli are rare. NATO confirmed one of the attacks -- a press officer said the strike on Bab bin Ghashir was timed to minimize civilian casualties. NATO said it targeted a vehicle storage area at Bab bin Ghashir. The tribal compound is used by people who volunteer as support forces for Libyan authorities. A decade ago, the site was used as a military station. NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of any means -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians from attack or the threat of attack. It has been conducting airstrikes targeting Gadhafi's military resources.

"(CNN) -- Sometimes, the effects of fame can ripple like a stone dropped in a pond. A YouTube video shows a Minnesota wedding party dancing down the aisle. Take the case of Minnesota residents Kevin Heinz and Jill Peterson. The couple had a fun idea for their wedding party to do a nontraditional procession to a catchy tune, ""Forever"" by Chris Brown. The joyous video of the group busting their loosely choreographed moves down the aisle went viral after the newlyweds posted it on YouTube. Soon they were being deluged by the media and flown to New York to appear on national television. Since then, millions have watched the funky wedding march and helped transform Heinz and Peterson into instant celebrities. Amy Carlson Gustafson, a pop culture reporter for the St. Paul Pioneer Press, reported on the story that she said has not only stirred up the hometown folks, but also showed a different side of Minnesota. ""I think people are loving it,"" she said.

Adding fuel to the fire was a planned live re-creation of the dance by the wedding party scheduled for Saturday morning on ""Today."" When it appeared that Heinz and Peterson weren't adhering to the age-old ""dance with who brung ya"" rule, their ABC-sponsored hotel and flight home were canceled, the paper said. ""We've been kicked out of our room,"" Heinz told the Post after the incident. ""New York is cutthroat. That's what we've learned."" ""Today"" reportedly stepped in and secured a new room and flight for Heinz and Peterson. Reporter Gustafson said she spoke with mother-of-the-bride Marge Peterson, who said her daughter and new son-in-law were done talking to the media. ""They are not used to this type of publicity,"" Gustafson said. Shane Mercado can relate. The 27-year-old from New York posted a video last year of himself mimicking step-for-step Beyonce's dance moves from her ""Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)"" music video. Mercado said he did it at the suggestion of a friend and before he knew it, he was a YouTube sensation. ""Once I did it I thought 'What did I just do?' "" he recalled. ""The response was overwhelming."" Soon, Mercado was a minor celebrity being asked for autographs and dancing his routine on the ""Bonnie Hunt Show."" ""Extra"" even arranged for him to surprise Beyonce on the red carpet during the premier of her film ""Cadillac Records"" Not only did the superstar singer know who he was, Mercado said, but so did other celebs. ""The actress Gabrielle Union knew who I was,"" Mercado said. ""That just blew me away.' Mercado said he doesn't consider himself famous and finds the notoriety humbling. The loss of anonymity is challenging, he said. Suddenly, the number of people ""in your business"" dramatically increases. He said he can imagine how Heinz and Peterson are feeling: overwhelmed. ""That was their [wedding] and it was probably very private to them,"" Mercado said. ""It can be a bit much to handle and if they were not ready to handle it, then it's not a good thing."" Being sucked into a vortex of whirlwind publicity can be a heady experience, said Atlanta, Georgia-based photographer Ross Oscar Knight. Two years ago, Knight photographed an elaborately staged engagement planned by Robert Gray Jr. to surprise his girlfriend, Keisha Williams. Gray rented 10 rooms at the Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead, and filled them with rose petals, candles, and music. As Gray led Williams to each room, friends and family were waiting with well wishes and prayers, all leading up to his proposal. A slide show of Knight's pictures of the moving event scored millions of hits and crashed several sites linking to it, the photographer said. ""I immediately started getting calls from all over the world,"" Knight said. ""We got an extra phone line because so many calls were coming in."" Not only were people touched, but many also wanted to have their engagements documented, Knight said, so there are sure to be dancing-down-the-aisle videos to come. Knight said Gray and Williams, whose fairy-tale engagement attracted the attention of national publications like Essence Magazine, have married but decided to do so quietly after shutting down a Web site they had started to keep fans updated. ""They did a private ceremony because they didn't want any of that released to the media,"" Knight said. ""I think they got to see stardom and what can happen when there is so much of a focus put on you."" Someone else who has also been thrust into the spotlight, albeit again, is singer Chris Brown, whose song the Heinz-Peterson wedding party danced to. Despite increased demand on iTunes for the single ""Forever"" and speculation by media outlets like Gawker.com that the wedding video could help rehabilitate Brown's image, US Weekly staff editor Lindsay Powers said she doesn't believe all will be forgiven. Brown, who has publicly apologized for assaulting his girlfriend, the singer Rihanna, has a long way to go before the tide of public opinion can be swayed, Powers said. ""I think that Chris Brown has had considerable career damage over these past couple of months,"" she said. ""I think that people are going to say that's a catchy song, they'll go to iTunes and download it to their iPods, but I don't think that because people like the song they are going to like Chris Brown.""","Minnesota couple instant stars after YouTube wedding video goes viral .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A darkened room in a Hong Kong university building is an unlikely portal into an ancient world. But with the touch of an iPad Mini, the space is digitally transformed into a 1,500-year-old Buddhist grotto. Its walls decorated with exquisite but faded paintings of enlightened beings, dancers and musicians. Another swipe and a pair of 3-D glasses brings the cave to life. Vivid pigments show how the cave must have looked when the paint first dried and animation and magnification reveal the tiniest of details. ""We can turn up all the lights, we can also fly up to the ceiling,"" says artist and academic Jeffrey Shaw, as he controls the virtual environment. Shaw, an Australian, co-leads a team at the School of Creative Media at Hong Kong's City University, which has pioneered the immersive digital technology -- harnessing advances in cinema, computer games and virtual reality. They believe the techniques developed will help preserve key heritage sites in Asia before they are irrevocably damaged by the onslaught of mass tourism. ""The primary concern is how to maintain the integrity of these caves for posterity,"" Shaw says. The team has worked on similar projects for Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Hampi in India but say this is the most ambitious in scope. The cave featured in the prototype is part of a larger complex located thousands of miles north of Hong Kong in the Chinese city of Dunhuang, once a Silk Road oasis and now a Unesco world heritage site. For almost two thousand years, the Mogao Grottoes, as the caves are known, withstood marauding barbarian hoards, earthquakes and the Gobi Desert's shifting sand dunes. Today, the caves and their frescoes face a different and perhaps more potent threat -- how to manage the increasing number of tourists that come to see caves. Some 680,000 tourists visited in 2011 and that number was exceeded by at least 100,000 last year. But the steep rise in visitors over the past decade has raised the level of humidity and carbon dioxide inside the caves, undermining conservation efforts. The grotto depicted by the team at City University is already closed to tourists and only 70 of the 492 decorated caves are open to the public. The pressures brought by the surge in visitors at Dunhuang are shared by many heritage sites across China and Asia, as the region's newly affluent middle class begin to travel in greater numbers. Wang Xudong, the vice director of the Dunhuang Academy, which is responsible for looking after the caves, says the optimum capacity for the Mogao Grottoes is 3,000 people a day. However, on October 2, during China's week-long national day break, more than 18,000 tourists visited the site. Plans are underway to limit visitor numbers through an online reservation system but Wang says that the use of digital tools to capture the caves before any further deterioration is a priority. A 50-strong team is documenting the site through extensive high-resolution photography and 3-D laser scanning. Each cave takes three months to document and the project is thought to be unparallelled in scale compared to similar efforts at other heritage sites. A new visitor center is due at the end of 2013 that will have a feature film theater and a 3-D reproduction of the original caves. ""It will help regulate the number of tourists and reduce the time spent in the caves on guided tours,"" Wang says. ""This will greatly alleviate the pressures brought by tourism on conserving caves that are on display."" The Dunhuang Academy and its digital team collaborated closely with City University in designing the cave recreation, which is called ""Pure Land: Inside the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang."" The installation was shown outside China for the first time in December when it was exhibited at the Smithsonian in Washington. After some refinements, the technology will also be deployed at Dunhuang, allowing visitors to interact with the caves in a completely different way. ""You could say it's a surrogate experience of visiting the caves but it's not merely mimicking a visit,"" says Shaw. ""Once you've got the cave in a digital representation you can do very special things with that you can't necessarily do in the actual cave."" A magnifying glass allows you to explore the one-to-one scale virtual environment, which depicts seven figures known as medicine Buddhas and other traditional images. Faded incense burners, lutes and harps were drawn by hand with traditional brushes before being scanned and modeled in 3-D. And experts in traditional dance at the Beijing Dance Academy were filmed in a blue-screen studio to bring to life their ancient painted counterparts. The effect is disarmingly beautiful and not at all gimmicky but will visitors to Dunhuang be satisfied at marveling at a recreation rather than the real thing? Shaw says they may have to be. Sealing caves to ensure their preservation is becoming an accepted practice despite debate over whether heritage sites should be hidden from public view. Most famously, the Lascaux Caves in France, which depict 17,000-year-old paintings of prehistoric animals, were closed to the general public in 2008 after the caves were beset by fungus and black mold. There are no current plans for a similar move at Dunhuang, but Shaw and his team believe that their digital technology may be the ultimate solution to the site's preservation -- and others like it.","Ancient Buddhist cave in China re-created in 3-D .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- NATO aircraft launched more than a dozen strikes on the Libyan capital early Tuesday, and smoke could be seen rising from the area near Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's Bab-al-Azizia compound in Tripoli. The NATO attack, one of the heaviest against Tripoli since the NATO mission began just over two months ago, started at about 1 a.m. and lasted more than 20 minutes, with alliance jets circling overhead and Libyan loyalist forces responding with anti-aircraft fire. Moussa Ibrahim, a Libyan government spokesman, said the attack targeted a guard compound for pro-Gadhafi military volunteers that had been emptied in anticipation. At least three people were killed and 150 wounded, Ibrahim said, calling the attack an escalation by NATO. Reporters felt and heard explosions from the airstrike that rocked the hotel housing members of the international media. Outbursts of gunfire, as well as ambulance sirens, could be heard in the streets. A NATO statement said the attack targeted a ""regime vehicle storage facility"" adjacent to the Bab-al-Azizia compound using precision-guided weapons. The facility resupplies government forces that have been attacking Libyan civilians, according to the NATO statement. Gadhafi's forces ""still represent a threat to civilians and we will continue to strike targets that carry out this violence,"" said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard of Canada, who commands the Libya operation. Journalists later visited a hospital where they reported they saw the bodies of three men, at least two covered in dust, and a number of injured people. CNN did not go on the hospital visit because of safety concerns. On Monday, forces loyal to Gadhafi attacked a rebel-held border crossing into Tunisia in a battle that resulted in nine deaths, according to the rebels' military commander in Zintan, Hajj Osama. He said Gadhafi infantry who attacked rebels controlling the border post suffered eight fatalities; one rebel fighter was killed. Food and fuel are shipped into Libya and wounded rebels are taken out for medical treatment via the crossing, which is literally a lifeline to the rebels, the rebel commander said. Since they were driven from the border checkposts by rebels more than two weeks ago, Gadhafi's troops have been shelling the rebels' nearby mountaintop holdouts to try to regain control of this vital artery. In the towns of Yefren and Algalaa, southwest of Tripoli, only about 1,000 residents remained of the usual population of 22,000, said a local person who is in touch with rebels there. The military commander in Zintan, near the border with Tunisia, corroborated those numbers. They contrast with figures issued by the Libyan Committee for Humanitarian aid and Relief, which said 22,000 to 25,000 people remained trapped in the two towns, and that about 40,000 others had been displaced to other towns in the Nafusa Mountains, Tripoli and Tunisia. For the past two months, the towns' dwindling numbers of residents have been enduring spartan living conditions -- without electricity or fuel and with only limited access to water, since Gadhafi forces control the region's water wells and have contaminated some of them with oil, the committee said. Banks in Yefren and Algalaa have been closed since February 17, which has led to a widespread shortage of cash, it added. The cities' main water tank has been out of commission since it was damaged six weeks ago by missiles and no food supplies have entered the area since March 1, it said. Snipers loyal to Gadhafi control access to the hospital in Yefren and most doctors have fled, it added. In other NATO efforts against Gadhafi forces Monday, an airstrike hit a Libyan army position outside the rebel town of Jadu in the western mountains, rebels in Zintan told CNN. The attack took place around noon (6 a.m. ET), shortly after the Gadhafi forces at that position had launched Grad rockets into the rebel-held town, rebels said. NATO reported Monday that since its operation began on March 31, it has flown 7,870 sorties, including 3,025 strike sorties, which are intended to identify and engage targets, but do not necessarily deploy munitions. On Sunday, a command-and-control center was hit near Tripoli and a missile support facility was struck near Al Khums, NATO said in a news release. Near Sirte, an ammunition storage facility was struck and, near Brega, a command-and-control facility was targeted, it said. A spokesman for France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said France plans to add attack helicopters to the country's arsenal in Libya, saying the aircraft would make ""more precise"" strikes possible. Media reports said Britain also plans to use attack helicopters. A spokesman for Britain's Ministry of Defense said only that, ""As with any military campaign, we are constantly reviewing our options alongside allies to enhance the capabilities available to NATO."" Nearly 600 migrants and wounded civilians arrived Monday afternoon in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi aboard a boat from the embattled city of Misrata, said the International Organization for Migration, which chartered the vessel. The boat's arrival marked the seventh such mission carried out by the group since mid-April. The boat's passengers included nearly 400 people from Niger as well as migrants from Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Pakistan, Egypt, Bangladesh, Tunisia and seven Palestinians. The boat had arrived Saturday in Misrata carrying 280 tons of food aid and a field hospital. The developments came as the International Committee of the Red Cross appealed to donors for an additional $53 million ""to help the organization meet the urgent needs of people affected by the fighting in Libya."" ""As long as the conflict in Libya continues, the outlook for the coming months is dire, and living conditions may further deteriorate for a large percentage of the population,"" said Boris Michel, ICRC head of operations for North and West Africa. The Council of the European Union reiterated its call Monday for the protection of civilians, a cease-fire and identifying Gadhafi as ""a threat to the Libyan people."" Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, was to detail on Monday meetings with Libya's rebel leaders a day after opening an office in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Ashton was to brief the EU's foreign ministers about weekend meetings where she pledged support from the 27-nation union to the chairman of Libya's Transitional National Council. ""I am here today to explain and be clear about the depth and breadth of our support in the European Union for the people of Libya,"" Ashton said in a statement Sunday by the EU shortly after her meeting with Mustafa Abdul Jalil, the transitional council chairman. During the meeting, Ashton said she and Jalil discussed security reform, border management, the economy and civil society. Arrest warrants have been issued by the International criminal Court for Gadhafi and two relatives, linking them to ""widespread and systematic"" attacks on civilians as they struggle to retain power in Libya. The court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, has said that the court in The Hague will investigate allegations of institutionalized rape in the war-torn country. A Libyan government official told CNN that Gadhafi's government welcomes the court's investigation but said that prosecutors ""have not been to Libya to do an investigation."" Siham Sergewa, a Libyan psychologist, has been collecting reports of women reportedly raped and beaten by Gadhafi'sforces that she says she is sharing with the criminal court. Sergewa told CNN's Sara Sidner that she began collecting the reports after receiving a call from the mother of a patient in Ajdabiya, a town in eastern Libya that was the scene of some of the earliest fighting between rebels and government forces. The mother told Sergewa that she had been abducted by three or four men and taken to the desert where she was raped. Since then, Sergewa told CNN she has collected surveys from more than 270 women at refugee camps along Libya's borders with Egypt and Tunisia who allege they were assaulted by Gadhafi forces. CNN's Nima Elbagir, Amir Ahmed, Nic Robertson and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Compound for pro-Gadhafi volunteers was targeted .

"(CNN) -- The only daughter of Moammar Gadhafi is standing behind her father, saying he will not step down because he is ""a symbol, a guide"" for the Libyan people. ""This is his country, his land, his people. Where would he go?,"" Ayesha Gadhafi, 34, told CNN affiliate France 2 during an interview at her home in Tripoli. ""There is one thing that you don't understand and that you will never understand. It is that my father is a symbol, a guide."" The comments by Gadhafi's daughter come as NATO's bombing campaign crossed the 100-day mark, raising concerns among some that the airstrikes could drag on for months. Gadhafi has been under enormous international pressure to step down following a months-long uprising by rebels, emboldened by popular movements across the Middle East, trying to bring an end to his 42-year rule. The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary, with the exception of a ground invasion, to protect civilians. NATO began bombing military targets a short time later. Gadhafi's daughter has accused NATO of war crimes for airstrikes targeting her father in Tripoli that resulted in the deaths of her four-month-old daughter, her brother and his two children. ""I am not hiding. I am at home. I live normally,"" she said in the France 2 interview that aired Thursday. ""But you see, I've already lost one of my children and my brother in the bombings. Every day there are members of my people who die. Civilians. Anyone who has a heart can understand what I feel."" Gadhafi's daughter has been a staunch defender of her father and a familiar sight on Libyan State TV. She is believed to have had a hand in keeping the peace among her seven brothers, who have vied over the years for positions of prominence at their father's side. ""Contrary to what has been said, our family is still very tight. These events have brought us closer than ever. There is no division, no difference between us,"" she said. ""What is being said about it is pure invention."" Ayesha Gadhafi, who studied in France, admonished the French for their participation in the NATO campaign. ""Never would I imagine this country would one day kill my brother and my family,"" she told France 2. ""Through you, I want to send a message to the wives of the French pilots who bomb us. 'Your husbands are not working to defend civilians in Libya,''' she said. ""They kill my people and our children and for what? To satisfy, (French President Nicolas) Sarkozy, who thinks that the more Libyans he kills, the more votes he gets during elections."" She has been described as a longtime, loud supporter of anti-government groups, standing up for the IRA and Iraqi insurgents. She even joined Saddam Hussein's defense team prior to his being sentenced to death by hanging in Iraq. When The Telegraph, a London-based newspaper, asked her how she felt about Iraqis who say Hussein slaughtered people, she said: ""You are bound to meet people who may be against your policies.""","Ayesha Gadhafi is the Libyan leader's only daughter .

"Dafniya, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan rebels and troops loyal to Moammar Gadhafi shelled each other for hours on Saturday in clashes at the highly contested frontline of Dafniya, an embattled town just west of the besieged port city of Misrata. At least 11 rebels were wounded in the exchange of fire and treated at one of the two field hospitals in what has been the most active day in Dafniya this week, according to a CNN team. Heavy government shelling on Misrata and Dafniya began shortly after Gadhafi rallied his supporters in an audio message on state TV and threatened to take the fighting to Europe in retaliation for NATO's bombing campaign. ""As soon as Gadhafi's speech ended, they started shelling Dafniya and around midnight there was a salvo of about eight rockets inside Misrata itself, and it continues on the front this morning,"" said CNN's Ben Wedeman, who was in Misrata Saturday. Gadhafi has vowed vengeance for NATO bombings in Libya. He said the Libyan military could be ""like locusts, like bees"" in Europe, potentially targeting homes and offices. ""You are mistaken, you are involved in a battle that you don't know what you are going to face, so withdraw and run away,"" Gadhafi told a pro-government gathering in Tripoli. ""Our people is able in one day to move the battle to the Mediterranean, and able to move the battle to Europe."" Gadhafi referred to NATO, which began bombing military targets in Libya after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- to protect civilians. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim on Saturday reiterated Gadhafi's call for vengeance. NATO's ""aggression is killing our children (and) Europe will have to face the consequences,"" he said. ""You will have people attacking Europe, joining terrorist organizations against Europe, and building a culture that makes legitimate all violence against Europe."" Ibrahim claimed rebel fighters ""have no popular support."" ""The rebels have no future,"" he added. ""They know it and they are terrified."" On Saturday,  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO mission in Libya is on track, with pressure on Gadhafi mounting and the rebel forces growing stronger. ""We need to see this through, and we are in complete agreement that we will,"" she said alongside the Spanish foreign minister in Madrid Saturday. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was taking seriously the Libyan leader's remarks. ""Certainly this is an individual who's obviously capable of carrying out these kinds of threats,"" he told reporters. ""It's what makes him so dangerous.  But he's also someone who's given to overblown rhetoric."" He said the United States would continue to support NATO's mission of increasing pressure on Gadhafi to step aside. The events came one day after the African Union's special committee on Libya said it had officially presented a plan meant to help Libya find a way out of the current crisis. The proposal states that Gadhafi will not be part of the negotiation process, but stops short of saying he should step down. ""It is envisaged to convene, soon, in Addis Ababa, (Ethiopia) negotiations between the parties to discuss these proposals,"" the group said in a statement. Committee members have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders over the past three months. Another African Union-led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in April. The French government was in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition, a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said Thursday. The French government has not confirmed the claim, which follows an acknowledgment earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere. CNN's Ben Wedeman and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","NEW: The African Union calls for talks between rebels and the government .

"London, England (CNN) -- She reputedly never carries any bank notes, but Britain's Queen Elizabeth II this week marked half a century since she became the first ever monarch to be depicted on one. Sketched by artist Robert Austin, the young queen first appeared in a £1 note in 1960 wearing a crown, earrings and a necklace, her likeness replacing images of Britannia -- a female symbol of Britain used on the country's currency for centuries. While her firm gaze and faint smile remain unchanged, the image of the queen has aged visibly over the decades, albeit very gracefully. A new image appeared in 1963, the year she marked her 37th birthday, and again in 1970 and 1971, the last of which survived unchanged for nearly two decades. The current image in circulation, showing an older queen, again wearing crown, necklace and earrings, dates from 1990. With the queen still officially head of state in many Commonwealth countries, Elizabeth II also features on many bank notes worldwide -- making her image one of the most widely reproduced of all time. To mark the anniversary, the Bank of England's museum this week opens an exhibition of past and present banknotes featuring the queen in addition to the original pencil sketches and printing blocks used to create them.","Young queen first appeared in a £1 note in 1960 .

"Zuwarah, Libya (CNN) -- Drive west from Tripoli along the Mediterranean coast for an hour an a half, and you'll see it in the distance: the gas flare at the Mellitah Oil & Gas Company's massive processing plant in Zuwarah. Just a few weeks ago rebels and Gadhafi loyalists were shooting it out right down the road. Houses and stores are scarred with blackened holes where shells hit. The complex, which processes and exports crude oil, natural gas, condensed gas and other products, survived intact, but the last export of crude oil was in March. Most of the Libyan workers were scared off by the fighting, and foreign workers pulled out en masse. Some natural gas still is flowing to nearby power plants but gas exports to Europe stopped shortly after the revolution began. By the water's edge you can see the gas pipeline behind a fence, curving down like the crook of an arm and disappearing into the earth. From here it stretches 330 miles under the Mediterranean Sea to Sicily, providing gas for Italy. The company is hoping it can restart gas supplies before the European winter sets in. In Tripoli, at the headquarters of Mellitah Oil & Gas, we meet Najmi M. Karim, the new chairman, appointed just a few days ago. He's moving into his new office at company headquarters. ""The biggest challenge for us is to get back to production levels before events. This is our target."" ""Events"" is one of the words Libyans now use to refer to the uprising of February 17. Karim says the company's facilities in the east and west of Libya suffered minimal damage in the conflict but officials in Tripoli still have not been able to establish contact with their El Feel oil field in the south where fighting still is ongoing. The facilities of other Libyan oil companies, he says, may have been damaged, especially ports and terminals. Some fields have been hit by vandalism. There are other challenges, including bringing back on-line equipment that has sat idle for more than half a year. For Mellitah, Karim says, getting workers back on the job is the first challenge. ""You have to first bring back the people to the field. This is the starting point. Without people in the field you cannot do anything,"" he says. ""Having the workers back in the field requires some logistics support from an accommodation point of view, catering, transportation, all these kinds of supports."" Safety is another concern. At the complex, safety supervisor Abdulbaset Montaser instructs us to wear yellow safety helmets and hands us emergency masks in case of any danger. He quickly reassures us: ""The system that we have here is a very good system and a high technology system, so for six years we don't have any problem with that. We don't have any explosion here."" Inside the control room workers watch computers monitoring every aspect of production. ""Please reduce the downstation steam,"" one engineer instructs over a radio. A majority, 85%, of Libya's export of its high-quality, low-sulfur light sweet crude go to Western Europe, but oil experts say the country currently is producing only 10%-15% of its normal 1.6 billion barrels a day. ""To reach the maximum of 1.6 million barrels per day, before the revolution started, that could happen anytime between a year or two years from now,"" Manouchehr Takin of the Centre for Global Energy tells CNN. Walking alongside the intense blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea with Mellitah's marine superintendant, Adel Sager, we gaze out at the now-empty pier where ships dock to load crude oil for export. The dock stretches two kilometers into the sea. Two tugboats wait expectantly by the quay. ""These ships come in from France and Germany?"" I ask him. ""Yes,"" he says, from many, many different nationalities and countries."" But the skyline is empty.","Oil experts say Libya is producing only 10%-15% of its normal 1.6 billion barrels a day .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's interim leadership gave residents in Bani Walid a 48-hour notice to leave the city as it sent reinforcements there and to the former regime's other remaining strongholds of Sirte and Sabha. As the National Transitional Council sought to assert control over all of Libya, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, arrived Wednesday in Tripoli on an unannounced visit. Feltman met with NTC head Mustafa Abdel Jalil and Mahmoud Jibril, chairman and head of international affairs of the NTC, as well as with many civil society representatives. ""I am encouraged by these individuals and these organizations' efforts,"" Feltman said. His conversations centered on three points, he said. First, that the United States respects Libya's sovereignty and that the country's destiny must be chosen by its people. Also, the United States and NATO are committed to supporting the Libyan people as they chart their country's future, and that the United States seeks to create a broad relationship with Libya based on mutual respect and shared interests. ""What an incredible accomplishment it is that we can meet and speak freely today,"" he said, adding that Americans were ""inspired by (Libyans') courage and determination."" Feltman is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Libya since the rebels took control of the capital. His visit was not announced beforehand because of security concerns, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters in Washington. Meanwhile, al-Rai TV aired what it called a live phone call from Musa Ibrahim, a spokesman for ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The speaker told the channel that hundreds of ""the criminals"" (NTC forces) were killed at the gates of Sirte and about 250 of their fighters were killed at the gates of Bani Walid. ""We will continue to fight ... until we liberate all cities,"" he said. Al-Rai, which is based in Syria, has been pro-Gadhafi. ""Do not think that the battle is over,"" he said. ""We have prepared ourselves to lead a holy struggle for years if needed."" In response to the latest Amnesty International report alleging Gadhafi forces committed crimes against humanity, he said, ""Most of those international organizations have no legitimacy and they have ... pro-imperialist and pro-colonization"" agendas. Earlier, al-Rai read a statement purportedly from Gadhafi that called for a halt to ""the terrorism and aggression of NATO"" in the town of Sirte, Gadhafi's birthplace. ""The terrorism and aggression of NATO in Sirte cannot be described and has no other similarity in the past or in the history of wars,"" the statement said. ""If Sirte is isolated from the world and this atrocity is committed against it, it is the world's duty to not be isolated from it. Therefore, you should take international responsibility and interfere immediately to stop this crime."" Fighting was continuing. NTC Cmdr. Ahamda Almagri said his column of some 500 anti-Gadhafi fighters captured the military air base at Dirak and arrested two Gadhafi loyalists; some 70 other loyalists fled the air base, which is the second-largest such facility in the south. Earlier, anti-Gadhafi forces said one loyalist soldier was killed and three were wounded in clashes with the same column, which was moving in the direction of Sabha in the south. As of Sunday, NTC troops were patrolling areas south of Sirte to try to cut off supplies to pro-Gadhafi forces still controlling the town. The troops were sweeping nearby areas to prevent other pro-Gadhafi towns from offering Sirte aid. Al-Rai, a privately owned station, has in recent weeks taken over for Libyan state media in filling the role of Gadhafi's mouthpiece. The interim government was still struggling with the three Gadhafi strongholds that remained in loyalist hands. Abdulrahman Busin, an NTC spokesman, told CNN that the ultimatum for Bani Walid was issued late Tuesday and ends Thursday night. Previous deadlines were aimed at negotiating with the loyalists to give up the city. The new deadline warns civilians to evacuate before an offensive by the NTC forces. At a checkpoint about nine miles outside Bani Walid, families who had driven from the city complained of difficult conditions inside, including limited food and water. People also said they did not feel safe inside the city. Jalil has said his goal is to create ""a state of institutions, a state of law"" in Libya. He was justice minister under Gadhafi before defecting to join the opposition in February. Gadhafi's whereabouts remain unknown, although some of his relatives have fled to Algeria and Niger. On Tuesday, NATO spokesman Col. Roland Lavoie told reporters that intelligence was received ""confirming at various times in the conflict Gadhafi was clearly within the country, but for a while he has not given any sign of life."" In New York, a draft Security Council resolution circulated Wednesday that would establish a United Nations Support Mission in Libya under the leadership of a special representative of the secretary-general for an initial period of three months. It adds that the mission's mandate would be to help Libya restore public security and order and promote the rule of law; undertake inclusive political dialogue, promote national reconciliation and begin the constitution-making and electoral processes. It would also help extend state authority, protect human rights, support justice and take steps needed to get the nation back on its feet economically. A vote on the proposal is expected within a few days. Speaking Wednesday in Zawiya, Jalil asked Libyans to unite so that ""the martyrs' blood will not be wasted."" ""Unite yourself to stop all the strife and jealousy and all the differences,"" he said. The sacrifices that Libyans made during the revolution will be worth it; women, for one, will have a stronger political role, he said.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- At least four explosions rocked the Libyan rebel-held town of Zintan on Sunday, as the foreign policy chief of the European Union arrived in the war-torn nation and a former U.S. congresswoman criticized American policy on Libyan state television. Rebels in Zintan, in western Libya, said they believe the explosions were from Grad rockets. It was not immediately clear whether any damage or casualties resulted. Meanwhile, Catherine Ashton, foreign policy chief for the European Union, arrived Sunday in the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi, according to military sources in the opposition's National Transitional Council. Officials earlier said the European Union would open an office in Benghazi on Sunday. ""It will be an honor to meet the people who have been fighting for democracy and a better future for Libya,"" Ashton said in a statement released by the council. ""I plan to meet key people from the National Transitional Council, civil society groups and our international partners, and will report back to EU foreign ministers on Monday. ""Opening an EU office is an important signal of our unfaltering support for the Libyan people,"" Ashton said. ""It is the EU putting words into action."" Ashton told reporters she has met with council leaders, members of the media, young people and representatives from women's groups and human rights organizations. ""I come with three messages,"" she said. ""The first is to echo again that (longtime Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi must leave, and we must have a future for Libya that belongs to the people of Libya and moves forward as they wish."" Secondly, by opening an EU office in Benghazi, ""I bring the commitment of the EU 27 member-states and all of the institutions in support of the people of Benghazi and the people of Libya, for us to support you in the future that you wish to see for your country,"" she said. ""And thirdly, to say that we don't just come for today, but that we're here for the long term -- that what the EU can offer is support as you build the country of the future, your institutions, your economy, your political life. We will be here to support you every step of the way."" NATO warplanes have been pounding military targets since March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution to protect civilians by any means necessary as Gadhafi's forces try to quash a nearly three-month revolt against Gadhafi's nearly 42 years of rule. Asked whether the office's opening means the EU will encourage member-states to recognize the National Transitional Council as Libya's new government, Ashton told CNN's Sara Sidner the subject did not come up during talks, and that it remains up to individual member-states to recognize the new government or not. Protecting civilians, she told reporters, is ""fundamental. Too many people have died already."" ""It will be very important,"" she told CNN, ""to safeguard what all this is about, which is human rights and fundamental freedoms."" Members of women's groups, she said, are anxious that women be fully represented in the process of building a new government. Rebels on the front lines near Libya's border with Tunisia, where a narrow finger of land controlled by rebels has become a vital supply route for the opposition, talked with CNN's Nic Robertson on Saturday. The area is under continued shelling by Gadhafi's forces, who are trying to close the route. ""Today is going hard,"" said one rebel fighter. He said he has lost his brother and others in the fighting, adding that he doesn't worry about himself as being martyred is honorable. He showed his gun, held together by pieces of tape. Late Saturday, former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney decried U.S. policy on Libyan state television, saying the ""last thing we need to do is spend money on death, destruction and war."" State television is fiercely loyal to Gadhafi, and McKinney's interview was spliced with footage of what appeared to be pro-Gadhafi rallies. ""I think that it's very important that people understand what is happening here,"" McKinney said in the interview. ""And it's important that people all over the world see the truth. And that is why I am here ... to understand the truth."" She said she was invited to Libya by the ""nongovernmental organization for fact-finding,"" adding that she intends to bring more people to the country soon so that ""they too can understand."" Gadhafi's government has repeatedly urged the international community to send fact-finding teams to Libya to report what's happening on the ground. At one point during the interview, state TV cut to what it said were live airstrikes, hitting Gadhafi's compound. ""Is that a bomb?"" McKinney asked. ""I want to say categorically and very clearly that these policies of war ... are not what the people of the United States stand for and it's not what African-Americans stand for,"" she told state TV. The former Georgia representative also slammed the economic policies of U.S. President Barack Obama and said the government of the United States no longer represents the interests of the American people. ""Under the economic policies of the Obama administration, those who have the least are losing the most. And those who have the most are getting even more,"" she said. ""The situation in the United States is becoming more dire for average ordinary Americans and the last thing we need to do is to spend money on death, destruction and war."" Separately, McKinney appeared on state-run Press TV this week in Iran. She was reported to be in Tehran attending the International Conference on Global Alliance Against Terrorism for a Just Peace.

"Misrata, Libya (CNN) -- The eyes of 15-year-old Nasser are fixed on a small metal part that belongs to a massive metal gun. He scrubs every tiny little crevice with a toothbrush until the bristles bend in awkward directions from the strain. This is how he now spends his time six days a week for 10 hours a day in the open yard of a makeshift weapons workshop. Nasser is one of Misrata's children. A boy who for more than 100 days suffered the frightening sounds of rockets falling from the sky and tanks blasting their way through the city as government forces battled to control the uprising against it from Misrata's citizens. ""It was really scary,"" he said. ""People really suffered especially during the first days of the war. There was not really anything, we lacked everything."" GPS: Five reasons stalemate is devastating . Four months later school is still out but the fighting has been pushed to three fronts outside the city. There is little for children to do. Nasser has found something along with a few other boys and he dismisses those who say children shouldn't be working on machines of war. ""I'd tell them to get back to work and try to understand the situation we are living these days,"" the 15-year-old said and quietly went back to putting together the gun he had just finished cleaning. The adult men working in the same area have nothing but good things to say about the effort the youth are making even the youngest among them. ""When I saw our young people my feeling is great,"" Ali Mohamed said. ""Our children, they will be the future of our country and they should know how they defend our city."" Gadhafi loyalists launch fresh assault on Misrata . The reality is rebel fighters are short on gun power and need whatever help they can get in order to obtain more weapons. They say defending the city means using all kinds of makeshift weaponry on Misrata's three battlefronts. The heaviest and most powerful guns are usually attached to pick-up trucks. The guns are often taken off tanks and re-purposed elsewhere. The tanks that are captured are usually burned or otherwise rendered useless but there are a few that have survived intact, and yet with all the shortages of weaponry not one is being used on Misrata's front lines. NATO: Time to plan for post-Gadhafi Libya . ""We cannot use the tanks because we received orders from NATO not use them so they put restrictions on how we can use them,"" rebel fighter Mohamed Wabash tells CNN. There is frustration setting in as opposition fighters have also been told to hold their positions but in this spontaneous uprising, war has not been meticulously planned. Strategies are being hatched in real time as the fighting rages on. Rebels make their first oil sale . But rebels on Misrata's western front made an unexpected move forward after they say Gadhafi forces tried to once again advance toward the city. Rebels fought back with all their make-shift weapons and managed to push Gadhafi forces three kilometers west inching them that much farther toward the rebels goal, the capital of Tripoli.","Nasser spends most of his time now in the yard of a weapons workshop .

"(CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi called Thursday for the U.N. Security Council to carry out an independent fact-gathering mission on Monday's NATO attack in the city of Surman, which resulted in civilian casualties. ""The Security Council should hold an urgent meeting to discuss the matter and stop this barbaric attack,"" he said in a nationally televised address. In the attack, five houses were hit in Surman, which is west of Tripoli, and 15 people died, including three children, according to a government spokesman. NATO has said the target was a command-and-control communications node involved in coordinating attacks on the Libyan people. ""While NATO cannot confirm reports of casualties, we would regret any loss of civilian life and we go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties,"" the organization said on its website. ""This is in stark contrast to the Gadhafi regime, which continues its policy of systematic and sustained violence against the people of Libya."" But Gadhafi angrily rejected the claim that the compound was anything but a residential area. ""This is not a military factory, munition factory or military port or a fortified castle,"" he said as video lingered over rubble. ""It has no military identity."" ""This is the jungle rule,"" he continued. ""The infidels rule. You don't have any conscience."" He blamed the members of the Security Council who approved the resolution in March that authorized the use of military force to protect unarmed anti-government Libyan demonstrators. ""You will be responsible for any outcome,"" he threatened, ""And you will regret it."" Gadhafi singled out U.S. President Barack Obama for blame. ""Originally, you're from Africa and originally Arab as well,"" he said. ""You sold out to America. Where will you go? On Judgment Day, you will be in hell. Our dead will be in heaven, and your dead will be in hell. You ought to feel ashamed."" Gadhafi then directed his vitriol toward the ""so-called heroic pilots"" who flew the NATO planes involved in the attack. ""You know we don't have any air defenses or military planes,"" the Libyan leader said, referring to the no-fly zone that NATO has imposed over Libya. ""You have long-range rockets and you have been flying over the Libyan air territory without any deterrent."" He said NATO's true motivation was inspired by hatred. ""You hate us because we are Muslims,"" Gadhafi said. ""You hate Libya and people who bear witness to Allah and Mohammed. You bomb them."" Gadhafi's late-night diatribe came hours after China embraced the Libyan opposition as ""an important dialogue partner"" and urged an end to the fighting and a political solution to the crisis, state media said. ""China is not seeking any private interest concerning Libya, and believes the Libyan situation is essentially an internal issue,"" said Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi after meeting with Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the executive board of Libya's National Transitional Council. Jibril's was the first visit by a Libyan opposition leader. He arrived in China on Tuesday, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. For the sake of the Libyan people, Yang called on the two sides to ""truly give peace a chance."" Also Wednesday, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini urged an end to the fighting in Libya to allow for humanitarian aid to flow to the war-devastated North African nation. Speaking in Parliament, Frattini said Italy backs a cessation to hostilities to negotiate a way for a humanitarian corridor. Frattini's comments came after he had been critical of reported civilian casualties in NATO airstrikes and said they threatened the credibility of the alliance. At a weekend summit in Cairo, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Libya was facing shortages of food, fuel and medical personnel and access to water services was dwindling. ""The U.N.'s humanitarian efforts are taking place under extremely difficult circumstances,"" he said. The Libyan war erupted from anti-government protests in February. Following a U.N. mandate to protect civilians, NATO began bombing military targets in March. However, Gadhafi still maintains control in Tripoli and other cities. Meanwhile, pressure has mounted from U.S. lawmakers to withdraw backing for the mission. ""The fact is the president has not made his case to the members of Congress, he has not made his case to the American people,"" House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday. ""We've been in this conflict for 90 days and the president hasn't talked to the American people for four or five weeks about why we're there, what our national interest is, and why we should continue,"" Boehner said. The day before, Senators John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and John McCain, R-Arizona, introduced a resolution to counter some of the criticism about the U.S. role in Libya. That resolution authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops.","NEW: ""Stop this barbaric attack,"" Gadhafi pleads .

"Zintan, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan government said Sunday it had retaken the key town of Bir al-Ghanam after losing it briefly to rebel forces, but a rebel commander said his forces were holding onto the town. Bir al-Ghanam is about 85 kilometers (53 miles) southwest of the Libyan capital Tripoli. Its capture is significant because little else stands between Bir Al-Ghanam and the Libyan coastline where Tripoli is situated. After rebels gained control of the town Saturday, one rebel fighter told CNN the ""next step"" was Tripoli. Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi Al-Mahmoudi told reporters in Tripoli on Sunday that rebel forces had the town for only a few hours. Bir al-Ghanam ""is now back in the hands of the honorable brave tribes, with its surface back in normal life and under the control of the legitimate government of Libya,"" Al-Mahmoudi said. But Nasr Abu al Qassem, who was in Zintan, about 70 km (43 miles) southwest of Bir al-Ghanam, said rebels remained at the front line in Bir Al-Ghanam and were being reinforced. The situation in the town was stable, he said. Some grad rockets were fired at the town from a distance Sunday morning, but no rebels were injured, he said. Rebel commanders said 1,500 opposition members joined in Saturday's battle, which lasted five hours. Rockets and gunfire were exchanged from both sides, and rebels took on Gadhafi fighters from three fronts. At least eight rebels were killed and dozens more were wounded, according to medical sources. Casualties inflicted on Gadhafi forces were not immediately known. The fighters in Saturday's attack were part of what some have dubbed a Mad Max army -- a fleet of pickup trucks modified to take heavy weapons speeding across the desert. Most of the men were civilians before the fighting broke out. For months, rebel fighters -- who have controlled the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer to the capital. They are seeking the ouster of Gadhafi, who has ruled Libya for 42 years. CNN's Michael Holmes and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","NEW: A rebel commander says the opposition still has control of Bir al-Ghanam .

"(CNN) -- A pair of north African delegates addressed the U.N. General Assembly for the first time Saturday, each representing a new government formed after revolution and civil war ousted their respective long-time leaders. From Libya, the executive chairman of the country's transitional council formally addressed the assembly's 66th annual session, saying his country was ready to ""redevelop itself"" and ""heal its wounds."" Mahmoud Jibril also called for a thaw of Libyan financial assets, frozen during the ongoing conflict between pro and anti-Gadhafi forces. Col. Moammar Gadhafi -- who ruled Libya with near absolute power for more than four decades -- fled from office last month, although pockets of resistance have remained. Jibril's speech was in stark contrast to a rambling 90-minute address given by the former Libyan leader two years ago in which he criticized the United Nations and the composition of its security council. From Egypt, Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr also addressed the assembly -- the first time an Egyptian delegate has done so representing a post- Mubarak government. Long-time strongman and former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down in February, handing over power to the military and ending three decades of iron-clad rule following an 18-day popular revolution. In a move that seemed to punctuate recent tensions between Egypt and Israel (rioters stormed the Israeli embassy in Cairo earlier this month) the country's foreign minister told delegates that Egypt is supportive of a Palestinian U.N. bid for statehood. He added that the Quartet -- representatives from the U.S., the U.N., Russia and the European Union -- had failed ""to come up with a balanced vision."" The first week of U.N. debates wrapped up on Saturday as delegates outlined their visions for peace and global security. But one topic remained at the forefront of the annual session: The bid for Palestinian statehood. On Friday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas put forth a historic request for full U.N. membership, a move Israel says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns. The measure prompted the Quartet to issue a call for renewed talks, after they broke down last year. Their statement Friday outlined a timetable for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement to be reached before the end of 2012, countering any anticipation of immediate change in the region. Abbas told reporters traveling with him Saturday that he would not comment on the Quartet statement before studying it, according to WAFA, the Palestinian Authority news agency. But he added that any proposal that did not include an end to settlement activities and a return to the 1967 borders would not be dealt with. He said there were many last-minute meetings on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, with diplomats seeking to persuade him to give up his request for Palestinian statehood. ""All these meeting, which were confusing, did not make us change our position because our goal was to deliver the official and humanitarian Palestinian message,"" Abbas said. Abbas' application -- viewed as a largely symbolic gesture because an American veto is all but assured should it come to a vote in the Security Council -- drew applause in the assembly when the Palestinian leader raised the document at the podium. ""Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N.,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a speech to delegates at the General Assembly earlier this week. ""If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now."" The American president said he supports Palestinian statehood, but reiterated a long-standing U.S. position that Israel must be part of the discussions. Israel has described the bid as counterproductive, and has called for an immediate resumption of talks to begin in New York and to be continued in Ramallah and Jerusalem. The Security Council is expected to meet Monday to further discuss the issue. Also Saturday, the international body hosted a mini-summit on drought and famine in the Horn of Africa. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said more than 13 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti ""need our help."" He said three-quarters of a million people are ""at imminent risk of starvation"" as a result of war, rising food costs and droughts that have continually plagued the region. The mini-summit coincided with a World Bank decision in Washington to boost aid to the region to $1.88 billion from more than $500 million, the D.C.-based financial institution announced Saturday.","Abbas says he will not comment on Quartet statement .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Anti-Gadhafi forces Saturday claimed a new military advance into the deposed Libyan dictator's hometown Sirte, while a fuel storage warehouse fire at the port of the country's capital city Tripoli in the west sent plumes of smoke into the air. National Transitional Council forces took a neighborhood previously held by remnants still loyal to Moammar Gadhafi, according to a spokesman. Twenty-four hours of NATO aerial bombardments preceded the advance. The western military alliance ""struck a series of targets (Gadhafi) forces used in order to threaten the civilian population of Sirte,"" NATO said in a statement. ""Among the reports emerging from Sirte are executions, hostage-taking, and the calculated targeting of individuals, families, and communities within the city,"" according to NATO, which also pointed to the involvement of mercenaries on the pro-Gadhafi side and denial of civilian access to food, water and medical care. Targets included a munitions stash, a command post and three large guns. During the advance, NTC fighters ""removed all the Gadhafi loyalists' checkpoints in that area, allowing for more revolutionaries to enter the town for the first time,"" said spokesman Adel Ghuleak with the NTC in Misrata. He said senior Gadhafi military members were in the neighborhood, a claim CNN is not able to confirm. Thirty NTC fighters sustained injuries in the push, Ghuleak said. One person died after a navy fuel warehouse at caught fire Saturday afternoon in Tripoli's port, according to a local physician. Twelve more suffered smoke inhalation, said Dr. Tarek Abu Selim, from Tripoli Central Hospital, who was at the scene during the fire. NTC security arrived at the scene and secured the surrounding area, blocking roads leading to the burning site and firing into the air to drive back dozens of onlookers. Journalists' access was limited. Sporadic explosions could be heard in the Libyan capital for an hour as the fire spread. The blaze has since been extinguished and the explosions ceased. A fire crew sprayed water on a ship docked near the warehouse, but it was not clear if the ship was burning. Libya's NTC is to hold an urgent meeting Sunday to discuss the formation of an interim government, a senior council member told CNN Friday. Mohammed Naser, the council member, said the formation of a government could take up to one week, but NTC members agreed that the interim government would include a premier, a vice premier, and 22 ministers. Earlier in the week, Elamin Belhaj, a senior member of the NTC, told CNN the formation of a Libyan government would not be announced until anti-Gadhafi forces controlled the borders of the country and liberated three cities that still remained under loyalist control -- Bani Walid, Sirte and Sabha -- a task that could take up to one month, he said. The NTC, he said, will expand as cities are liberated in order to give representation to all regions of the country. Ultimately, the council could have approximately 80 members; it currently has 43. Elections for a National Congress is slated to take place in eight months. At the creation of the congress, the interim government will cease to exist.

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to have been over in a few days. World powers would go in with fighter jets and the world's most sophisticated precision-guided weapons to render Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi powerless. But that's not the way things happened. As NATO's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark, analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions, including success based solely on surgical airstrikes, for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months. ""It's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this,"" said Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation and director of Aberfoyle International Security, a Toronto-based agency specializing in security issues related to the Islamic world. The basic problem, McGregor said, stemmed from presuppositions about the fortitude of the Libyan opposition. Buoyed by the successful uprisings to the east in Egypt and to the west in Tunisia, Libyan rebels believed they had the mettle to bring down Gadhafi. Western powers believed that with a little help, Libya could be freed from totalitarian rule. But rebels launched an armed insurrection against a man who had spent four long decades preparing his state for unforeseen challenges. This wasn't a peaceful revolution of the masses against a government that had no public support. ""This revolt never really had the strength to succeed,"" McGregor said. ""There was this feeling among the rebels that all we have to do is show up. But you should take a couple of years to get it organized first. If you're just going to run out on the streets, the results will be predictable."" Four months on, the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves, McGregor said. They are out of fuel, oil production has shut down, and they have few available resources. They will soon face even shortages of food and water, McGregor said. President Barack Obama faces pressure at home to withdraw U.S. forces. There is debate, too, in Europe over the expensive air campaign. The war may have been morally right, but NATO, said McGregor, is facing a conundrum. Part of that failure was a lack of consideration of the makeup of the Libyan population, said University of Texas political scientist Alan J. Kuperman, author of ""The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention."" ""The fundamental error by the White House and NATO was to imagine that the Libyan people were united in opposition to Gadhafi,"" he said. ""In reality, Libya is divided along lines of clan and tribe, some of whom benefit greatly from Gadhafi, and therefore defend him fiercely,"" he said. ""Any expert on ethnic conflict and intervention could have told the White House that ahead of time."" In that respect, said Thomas Donnelly, director of the Center for Defense Studies, the Libyan war has the potential for fallout that is worse than what happened after President George W. Bush declared ""mission accomplished"" weeks after Saddam Hussein's 2003 ouster in the Iraq war. ""To imagine that Libyans are going to come together -- is a hope, but not a plan,"" Donnelly said. ""It was a mistake to get involved in such a feckless way."" Behind the rhetorical rallying cry of protecting civilians, Donnelly said, has always been the real aim of NATO -- to kill Gadhafi. ""If you made me bet my mortgage at gunpoint, I'd say we probably will get Gadhafi,"" he said. But the question is when. And if it doesn't happen in a timely fashion, then NATO risks the erosion of public support for its campaign, Donnelly said. ""In some sense, 100 days is a short period of time,"" he said. ""But when your political support is so tenuous and thin, and when your operations have heretofore been ineffective in achieving campaign goals, then taking ground forces off the table has not made the war any shorter or any less bloody."" The Libyan regime has also proven itself to be more robust and resilient than anyone imagined. It would be a mistake, said Donnelly, to assume that killing Gadhafi would mean a collapse of the entire system. The Libya conflict has sometimes been compared to NATO's air war in the Balkans in the 1990s. Many people thought the Serbs would go down instantly once NATO began bombing. They didn't. And eventually, it was the threat of a ground invasion that led to the capitulation of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Gadhafi, however, faces no such threat. And some believe the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court this week will only help strengthen his resolve to stay in power. ""If Barack Obama had thought a hundred days ago that he would be where he is now, you have to wonder whether he would have made the same decision,"" Donnelly said. ""How can you tell the American people we're going to start jumping over the fence and we have no idea where we are going to come down?"" But not everyone is pessimistic about prospects in Libya. Ali Ahmida, for one, stands by his belief that the Libyan opposition can defeat Gadhafi. The rebels, he said, have made noticeable gains with the support of NATO air power. He cited recent rebel takeovers of western towns in the Nafusa Mountains and said Gadhafi is more isolated now than ever before. ""The Libyan people are capable of fighting this fight,"" said Ahmida, an analyst at the University of New England. ""The consequences of this, even though it is more painful and brutal, will have a positive outcome in the end."" It has not been easy for Ahmida to watch the conflict unfold in Libya. But he is a strong proponent for self-determination who feels strongly that the Libyan people, not outside forces, must determine their fate. ""I warned against this from the start, that Libyan public opinion would not like it,"" he said, referring to the possibility of foreign boots on the ground. And Ahmida still questions the motivation of Western powers and the agendas of exiles who he fears may want to exploit oil-rich Libya. ""I'm optimistic but guarded,"" he said. Ahmida said the bad news is that NATO lacked clarity in its mission and also in a negotiated exit for Gadhafi, which he said is more difficult now because of the arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity. Still, Gadhafi's regime will fall, he said. Then the real battle for the future of Libya will just be starting.","An air war alone is not enough, say some analysts .
But without ground troops, what is the end game?
Some fear a protracted war that could go on for months .
A Libyan analyst says self-determination is key ."
"Paris (CNN) -- U.S., European and Arab leaders delivered a strong warning to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Saturday, saying he must stop attacking his own people or else face international military action. The warning, announced by French President Nicolas Sarkozy at the end of a last-minute meeting in Paris, came as Sarkozy revealed French fighter jets were already flying over rebel-held areas of Libya to protect the population. ""If there is not an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of the forces that have been attacking civilian populations in the last few weeks, our countries will have recourse to military means,"" Sarkozy said, adding that all participants at the meeting endorsed the warning. French planes fired on a Libyan military vehicle Saturday evening, according to the French Defense Ministry. Participants at the meeting in Paris agreed on an urgent need to act. They agreed to use ""all necessary means, in particular, military means"" to enforce a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force against Libya, Sarkozy said. Gadhafi, however, ""has totally ignored this warning,"" Sarkozy said. Sarkozy called it the ""murderous madness"" of a regime that has ""forfeited all its legitimacy."" At the same time he spoke, Sarkozy said the French air force is opposing any aggression by Gadhafi's forces against the population of rebel-held Benghazi. ""As of now, our aircraft are preventing planes from attacking the town,"" Sarkozy said. ""Other French aircraft are ready to intervene against tanks."" Sarkozy said enforcing the U.N. no-fly zone through military action is not in order to impose a specific outcome -- such as regime change -- but is instead ""in the name of the universal conscience that will not endorse such crimes."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed that idea, saying the purpose of enforcing the U.N. resolution is ""to protect civilians from their own government."" Sarkozy said Gadhafi still has a chance to ""avoid the worst"" if he complies ""immediately and unreservedly"" with the demands of the international community. ""The doors of diplomacy will open once again when the aggression stops,"" he said. Sarkozy's comments came at the end of Saturday's meeting, which included delegations from the United States, Canada, European Union and Britain, along with Iraq, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations. In a communique, leaders said they have a long-term commitment in the area. ""We assure the Libyan people of our determination to be at their side to help them realize their aspirations and build their future and institutions within a democratic framework,"" the statement said. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who was at the meeting in Paris, said participants decided to make Gadhafi face the consequences of his actions. ""Colonel Gadhafi has made this happen,"" Cameron told the BBC. ""He has lied to the international community. He has promised a cease-fire, he has broken that cease-fire, he continues to brutalize his own people, and so the time for action has come. It needs to be urgent."" As they met, participants were ""aware of the news reports"" coming out of Libya that show Libyan government forces moving toward Benghazi, a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters. ""Time is pressing,"" Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, told the meeting Saturday. ""Action is needed now to protect the population."" Clinton said Gadhafi's forces ""face unambiguous terms"" and that a cease-fire must be implemented immediately. ""That means all attacks against civilians must stop,"" she said after the Paris meeting. ""Troops must stop advancing on Benghazi and pull back from Ajdabiya, Misrata and Zawiya. Water, electricity, and gas supplies must be turned on to all areas. Humanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya."" Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, another participant at the meeting, proposed the use of the NATO base in Naples as a command center for allied action in Libya, a spokesman for the Italian leader said.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan government forces fired a missile at an Italian warship in the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday in a rare attack on the NATO fleet offshore, a government spokesman said. The frigate Bersagliere was about 19 kilometers (12 miles) off the Libyan city of Zlitan when the missile fell harmlessly into the sea about 2 km away, the Italian defense ministry and NATO reported. ""The ship was not harmed and continued on its mission,"" NATO said in a statement. ""NATO ships go in harm's way to seek those military targets which continue to threaten the people of Libya."" In Tripoli, government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters that the missile had been launched by troops that remain loyal to longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. ""We have amazing capabilities that we have not felt that we need to use,"" Ibrahim said. ""Our army is still very strong. We . haven't used our real military power."" He discounted allied claims that pro-Gadhafi forces had been reduced to 20% of their capabilities, adding, ""For God's sake, if we are down here to 20%, what am I doing here?"" Gadhafi's forces have been battling a nearly six-month-long revolt that has split Libya roughly in half. NATO planes and warships joined the fight in March, pounding government troops under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from reprisals by Gadhafi loyalists. Though most of the allied campaign has been conducted from the air, NATO warships reported fighting at least two brief sea engagements with pro-Gadhafi forces off the port city of Misrata in May.

"(CNN) -- Libyan government tanks were shelling civilian areas in Misrata Tuesday and government forces were using heavy artillery as well, bringing ""absolute and utter carnage"" to the city, a witness told CNN. Government forces were also evicting thousands of residents and looting their homes, according to the source with the Libyan opposition. Rebels were using schools and mosques to accommodate the evicted, he said. ""Things are getting so much worse"" in the city, he said. Coalition planes circled overhead but did not strike the tanks, he said. In an interview with CNN, he pleaded for coalition forces to take action and stop the government troops. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces were ""advancing in all directions of the city,"" he said. Battles have been under way in Misrata for weeks. The Libyan government took some journalists to Misrata Monday in an effort to suggest that Gadhafi's regime had control of the city, but did not allow journalists into the city center, which rebels have said they control. Misrata is in western Libya, east of Tripoli.","A witness says coalition planes are circling overhead but not striking .

"Lampedusa, Italy (CNN) -- Shortly after dawn, an open blue wooden fishing boat from Libya limped its way into the port of this tiny island, crammed with at least 166 shivering passengers, all of them apparently migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa. Italian coast guard officers and rescue workers helped offload the passengers, wrapping an infant in a metallic blanket and taking at least one man away on a stretcher. The passengers left behind husks of bread, soggy blankets, and fluorescent life jackets, scattered in the hull of the boat. ""I still have the trauma inside me. Because of the cold, the water. Because I've never tried this before in my life,"" said a 21-year old man from Sierra Leone who only gave his first name Abubakr. Abubakr said the boat departed from the Libyan capital of Tripoli on Thursday morning and reached this tiny Italian island after a perilous 24-hour journey. The boat was just the first of five boats that arrived Friday carrying 1,271 passengers. On Saturday, two more boats carrying more than 400 people from Libya and Tunisia reached the island, the U.N. High Commissioner for Regfugees said. Most of the refugees are from Sub-Saharan Africa, including Sierra Leone and Senegal. There are also Bangladeshis, some Egyptians and Tunisians. ""The sea is really difficult ... I vomited so much,"" said Ibrahim Cooper, 26, also from Sierra Leone. Despite reports that a similar ship sank off the coast of Libya, killing at least 16 migrants, more than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. Late Thursday night, Italian authorities were tracking one boat from Libya carrying 250 migrants that was said to be leaking. That vessel is believed to now be in the territorial waters of Malta. Passengers onboard Friday morning's boat said they made the journey to escape the fighting in Libya. ""It's a war situation now,"" Abubakr said. ""Anything can happen. That's why we have to run for our lives. Because we are blacks. We are not secure in that country."" Cooper huddled on the pavement of the port, eating a biscuit distributed by Italian emergency workers. ""We are now refugees in Italy,"" Cooper said. ""The Italian government and the E.U. should do something to help us."" The armada of leaky boats full of migrants that have flooded Lampedusa over the past three months has become a hot-button political issue both in Italy and the European Union. A diplomatic spat erupted recently when France prevented a train carrying dozens of Tunisian migrants from crossing the border from Italy. Meanwhile, this week, the Danish government announced it would begin checking passports at the border of Denmark. These measures threaten to undermine the Schengen agreement, which allows free movement across European borders. One unexpected consequence of the revolutions that have swept through North Africa is the collapse of border controls in Tunisia and Libya. Lampedusa and Malta, both islands less than an hour's flight from the North African coast, have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa, which numbers less than 6,000. Migrants slept in the streets of this small fishing port. Dozens of blue fishing boats from Tunisia and Libya are piled up in a boat graveyard outside Lampedusa's small commercial port. Nearby, graffiti on a wall says ""Basta Siamo Pieni,"" meaning, ""Enough, we are full."" Today, the number of new arrivals from Tunisia has reduced somewhat, thanks in part to a recent agreement with Italy to improve patrolling along the Tunisian coast. But as the war rages on in Libya, the number of barely seaworthy vessels departing Tripoli for Europe has increased drastically. A local priest is planning to hold a memorial service in Lampedusa later Friday for three other migrants who washed up on the shore of this small Mediterranean island last Sunday. The boat they are believed to have traveled on lies on its side on the rocky shore of Lampedusa days after it ran aground.","NEW: More than 1,250 have arrived by sea .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A senior government official arrived Monday in Cairo amid rumors that he had defected, Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported. Nasr al-Mabrouk Abdallah arrived with nine of his family members on a private plane from Djerba, Tunisia, the newspaper reported, citing an unidentified airport official. Djerba is about 150 miles (240 kilometers) west of Tripoli. Meanwhile, a U.S. defense official confirmed Monday that Libyan forces loyal to Gadhafi fired a short-range Scud missile on Sunday at a rebel stronghold, but by all accounts the missile failed to reach its target. The official said the missile was launched from a government-held area 50 miles east of Sirte and landed 50 miles east of Brega in the desert. In Cairo, Libyan Embassy officials did not greet Abdallah's plane when it pulled up to Cairo's Terminal 4, which is the arrival point for private planes, fueling speculation that Abdallah may have abandoned leader Moammar Gadhafi, Al-Ahram said. The newspaper and an official at Cairo International Airport identified Abdallah as Libya's minister of the interior. However, a Libyan government official -- whose information has proved reliable in the past but who is not allowed to talk to the news media for attribution -- identified Abdallah as an administrative director at the Interior Ministry and a former Libyan minister. The official said he could confirm that Abdallah had traveled to Egypt with his family on nonofficial business, but could not specify the nature of the trip. A Libyan government website reported in June that Abdallah had been sworn in as deputy minister of public security. Libya's interior ministry is called the Ministry of Public Security. Asked about the apparent defection, Tripoli government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said he would not comment on any personal decisions by Abdallah. ""In the last while, we noticed that he had intense social pressures on him. It's probably not appropriate that we talk about it in detail because it's personal."" Ibrahim added, ""Truthfully, he has fallen under a lot of social and emotional pressure as we've noticed. He couldn't handle it and preferred that he left. That's a personal decision."" Abdallah's departure comes as rebels have been reporting major advances toward their goal of cutting off Libya's coastal road, the Tripoli regime's lifeline, and reaching the capital. In the coastal city of al-Zawiya, clashes were ongoing. ""At the moment, it's quite hard to say who is in complete control of the city,"" said Deborah Haynes, a reporter for the Times of London who left the city Monday. ""The rebels say they have 80% of it under their control, but it is a very fluid situation."" Pro-Gadhafi snipers were holed up in buildings in the main square, where rebels were firing at them with rocket-propelled grenades, she said. Rebel fighters controlled all but the eastern part of the city, said Hassan Jwaili, who is a rebel fighter and a source who has proven reliable in the past. Gadhafi forces shelled al-Zawiya with Grad rockets from nearby Janzur, killing two rebels, bringing the number of dead in al-Zawiya to 11, with dozens more wounded, Jwaili said. NATO airstrikes, though, have hit Gadhafi forces in Janzur, aiding the rebels, he said. West of al-Zawiya, rebel forces entered the towns of Surman and Sabrata late Sunday, Jwaili said. Twenty-two rebel fighters died and 38 were wounded in the towns, he said. West of Sabrata, rebels surrounded Gadhafi forces inside a military camp, he said. Clashes were continuing for control of Tiji, on the plains of the western mountains, Jwaili said. And in Assaba, east of Qawalish, also in the western mountains, rebel fighters had surrounded the city and negotiations were under way for Gadhafi forces to turn themselves in, Jwaili said. But a Tripoli government spokesman denied the assertions that rebels were advancing. Gadhafi himself, in an address broadcast Monday on Libyan state television, urged Libyans to fight opposition forces and ""cleanse this sweet and honorable land."" Cheers from the crowd accompanied the speech, cries of ""Allah, Libya, Gadhafi and nothing else"" at times drowning out Gadhafi. ""We dance and sing despite the strikes! The strikes will be over and NATO will be defeated,"" Gadhafi said. ""Move always forward to the challenge; pick up your weapons; go to the fight in order to liberate Libya inch by inch from the traitors and from NATO. Be prepared to fight if they hit the ground."" Claims of control over the city of al-Zawiya -- if true -- would be a strategic blow against government forces, since the road through the city serves as a critical supply line to Tripoli from the west and has an oil terminal. In his news conference Monday evening, Ibrahim denied the assertions and said Gadhafi forces were in ""complete control"" of al-Zawiya after having halted rebel attacks there. ""There are a few armed gangs inside the city who took advantage of the opportunity to enter but they are limited,"" he said. ""All of south Zawiya is protected. The armed gangs tried to attack people in their homes, occupy a school and raid shops. The government closed off a main road for the protection of the people."" The rebels say that they were the ones who closed the coastal road. Ibrahim said heavy NATO airstrikes were continuing to strike some coastal cities, including al-Zawiya, with the eastern city of al-Brega bearing the brunt of the attacks. ""To be honest, they're unable to shake our civilians or our youth,"" he said. He said the rebels suffered heavy casualties. ""Hundreds of them injured and tens killed. Because of this, now people in the eastern regions and even the armed gangs refer to al-Brega as a cemetery. Al-Brega is synonymous with death."" In Tiji, 40 rebels were killed by pro-Gadhafi forces, who took three tanks and a number of weapons from them, he said. Ibrahim said officials were negotiating with international companies that have expressed interest in returning to Libya, he said. The goal is for them to resume operations ""very soon."" Ibrahim added that the Tripoli government forces were planning to ""free"" the key port city of Misrata from rebel forces. ""We can't tell everything but we're in a position to free Misrata,"" he said. ""It's not an easy feat."" Rebel commander al-Zintani rejected Ibrahim's assertions that Gadhafi's forces controlled al-Zawiya and Surman, which is also along the western supply road, as well as the government's claims to Garyan, another city on a key supply route leading to Tripoli from the south. ""The next few days will prove him wrong,"" the rebel field commander predicted. NATO said Sunday it had struck a Gadhafi military facility in Garyan. Rebel spokesman Jumma Ibrahim has said that rebels control the coastal road connecting al-Zawiya with a post on the Tunisia border, but that Gadhafi forces still controlled the post. Reports from Tunisia's state-owned Tataouine radio corroborated the account. CNN has not been able to independently confirm battle claims, including who controls al-Zawiya. Daily claims of rebel successes indicate rapid progress when compared with positions rebels claimed on previous days. The government in Tripoli has consistently downplayed claims of rebel victories and played up the strength of Gadhafi's forces. ""You have to remember we are very powerful,"" Musa Ibrahim said Saturday. ""The tens of thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers are armed right now. It doesn't matter whether NATO advances or not, whether rebels advance or not, because we will always be able to fight, in a year's time, in two years, in three years."" Five months into the Libyan war, the rebels have won international support in their effort to oust Gadhafi. They have been aided by NATO airstrikes that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that ordered civilians be protected.

"Zintan, Libya (CNN) -- In all his years in power, Moammar Gadhafi has never been portrayed as anything but regal in paintings and statues scattered throughout Libya. Until now. Six months into Libya's war, some artists in rebel strongholds are arming themselves with fresh paint. Their belief? A brush can be as mighty as the Kalashnikov in the fight against the strongman. ""Everybody supports the revolution in some way,"" says Mohammed Zamoul, formerly a bulldozer driver. ""Some people fight, I use the brush."" In Tripoli, a massive mural of Gadhafi remains intact. Zamoul's work is far less flattering. His caricatures of Gadhafi sucking on his country's oil reserves, pinned down by a rebel flag and being launched out of Libya on a bomb -- are everywhere around his hometown of Rujban in the country's western mountains. ""Building owners welcome it,"" he says. ""Not one single person said no. I get a lot of support."" Several miles away in the rebel-controlled city of Zintan, Masoud Baji is also using art as weapon. He was a calligrapher before the uprising began in Libya last February. Now, he revels in his new career. Each of his paintings, he says, expresses Gadhafi's persecution of the Libyan people. One portrays Gadhafi as a vampire sucking the wealth of the people. ""He has not left anything for them, he kept us illiterate, without education,"" Baji says. ""He kept everything for himself."" Some of the paintings are humorous. Some make strong political commentary. All are new in a nation where freedom of expression was an unknown under Gadhafi. ""Now we can express ourselves freely, thank god,"" Baji says. ""The chains have been lifted. Everyone can express themselves. Even a simple painting about the tyrant, now we can paint. Before the revolution we could not do that, he would arrest and in some cases kill us."" Zamoul and his assistant, calligrapher Abdul Aziz, bear sizzling daytime temperatures to create their latest fresco -- ""The Lady of the Sea"" beckoning rebel fighters to come and join her in Tripoli. ""What I have inside I can now express and put it on the walls,"" Zamoul says. In this particular expression, he has, perhaps, captured the heart of the Libyan rebels, fighting bitterly to make it Tripoli.","Political art is springing up in rebel-held areas of Libya .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A Libyan revolutionary fighters' convoy came under attack Saturday on the outskirts of Sirte, the birthplace of Moammar Gadhafi, injuring a CNN journalist who was traveling with them. Ian Lee was treated for shrapnel in his ankle in a rocket propelled grenade (RPG) attack. He was in good spirits and was able to speak with his family by phone. Lee was with a CNN team traveling with anti-Gadhafi fighters and other journalists towards Sirte, where fierce fighting unfolded again Saturday. The revolutionaries have been met there with stiff resistance from loyalists. From a roundabout on the edge of the city, where revolutionaries have been amassing, the CNN team followed fighters heading north towards the sea to evacuate civilians, said CNN correspondent Phil Black, who was with Lee. For an unknown reason, one fighter began shooting his gun, causing others also to shoot. Soon after, the convoy started taking incoming fire. At first it was small arms, quickly followed by RPGs. Two vehicles near the CNN team were hit by at least two RPGs. The CNN journalists pulled back, rushing Lee to nearest field hospital, Black said. At least one anti-Gadhafi paramedic was killed in the same attack. It was not immediately clear whether there were other casualties.","An anti-Gadhafi convoy comes under fire .

"(CNN) -- U.S. security policy showed the effects of two substantial pivots this past week: ramping down our role in regime transformation in one Arab country even while ramping up our responsibility in another. First to Libya, where the death of Moammar Gadhafi has finally ended the first act of what promises to be a long drama. As Iraq and Afghanistan have amply proven, collapsing the old regime is the easy part; building a functioning civil society is the real challenge. Gadhafi's apparent execution after he was captured, on top of the still unexplained murder of the anti-Gadhafi forces' commander Abdel Fattah Younis three months ago, highlights the chaos and infighting that still exist in Libya and the need to help the Libyans build a viable state. Michael Scharf: Investigate Gadhafi's killing as a war crime . There is more than altruistic international good citizenship involved here. If Libya is left to its own devices, it is not difficult to conceive of it becoming Somalia on the Mediterranean, an ungoverned space threatening the heart of Europe as well as critical international lines of communication. We have already begun to fret over the loss of control of thousands of man-portable surface-to-air missiles. These are reasons enough to stay engaged. There are other effects from this week's success that will also need to be managed. NATO stretched the United Nations' mandate to ""protect civilians"" as far as legally possible (about as far as we domestically stretched the definition of ""not war""), actively isolated portions of the battlefield to ensure local advantage to the anti-Gadhafi fighters, and conducted what at times looked like close air support -- integrating NATO airpower with the fire and movement of their ground forces. What impact will being the air force for the National Transitional Council's fighters have on Security Council members when next they face a question of ""protecting"" civilian populations? Are reprisals an inevitable byproduct of revolution? The Libyan success will also have to be managed within NATO. It was American intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, defense suppression, electronic warfare, refueling and precision weapons that kept the alliance in the game. Will the lesson be that Europeans will have to do more in the future? Or did the Libyan adventure teach them that current levels of investment are ""good enough""? It's not an idle question, as many seem to already be crowding around the exits in Afghanistan. And this week's events in Libya will have regional impacts. For Egypt and Tunisia, they hold the long-term prospect of a like-minded neighbor. For rulers in Syria and Yemen, they pose an existential question: Does Libya teach me what happens if I stay too long? Or does it simply reinforce what I already knew -- that the stakes of this game are very high and I have to do whatever I have to do to win? For rulers in Tehran the issue is less ambiguous: So this is what the West might do to you if you give up your nuclear program. Gadhafi and son buried in undisclosed location . While managing these byproducts of success in Libya, the president also announced that, by the end of the year, ""the last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their head held high, proud of their success."" For some in the United States and in Iraq this was a rewarding moment, the end of a bad chapter for both peoples. Others, though, smell danger. Many had expected a sustained American presence; even Iraqi military leaders had talked about the continuing need for training, intelligence, logistics and air defense from the United States. There was also just the raw political impact of a continued American footprint. In the north, Americans on the ground had dampened native passions along an Arab-Kurd-Turkmen fault line. American presence overall gave heart to those in the Iraqi political spectrum who would oppose undue Iranian influence in Iraqi affairs. That presence also seemed to help manage Turkish reaction (and potential overreaction) to PKK raids allegedly mounted from Iraq. And for Iraqi Sunnis, a visible American footprint was often seen as their best guarantee against the actions of what many viewed as a predatory Shiite government. In short, a continued American presence was seen as calming, buying time for Iraqi politics and institutions to grow to meet the demands they are facing. To be sure, the United States is not abandoning Iraq. Our talented ambassador there, Jim Jeffrey, will have some 16,000 government employees and contractors under his command. But this is not the same as an enduring military presence. Many seemed to realize this. American commanders in Iraq regularly called for a substantial five-figure residual force, and two successive secretaries of defense advocated publicly for a continued American presence, even as the president they served did not draw back from his campaign commitment to end the American military's role there. In the end, though, it was the Iraqis, and especially Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who could not deliver on the one nonnegotiable American demand -- immunity from Iraqi law for U.S. troops. No American administration could accept anything less. Given al-Maliki's worldview and his fragile political situation, it was hard enough to wrest this concession from him in 2008. It required a sustained, unrelenting, personal effort from the highest levels of the U.S. government, and success was never guaranteed. It is not clear that similar efforts were made in 2011. Obama makes war policy an election strength . In any event, the president chalked up the U.S. withdrawal as a ""promise kept,"" even as his officials worked to the last minute to sustain a U.S. presence. In both Iraq and Libya it was an interesting week: engagement and disengagement, leadership and resignation, moving in and moving out -- with both the burden and the necessity of global leadership on clear display. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael V. Hayden.","Last week saw death of Gadhafi, plan to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq .

"(CNN) -- As many as 270 Libyan refugees were missing in the sea after the overcrowded boat they were in encountered bad weather, the Tunisian state-run TAP news agency reported. The Tunisian coast guard responded to the rescue call regarding the fishing trawler, which became disabled Wednesday night near the Kerkennah Islands. The ship was reportedly taking some 800 refugees from Libya to the Italian island of Lampedusa, TAP reported. An official told the agency that between 200 and 270 people were missing. At least two bodies had been recovered, the agency reported. People on the boat began pushing each other in a panic to reach the lifeboats when they ran into high waves and winds, TAP said. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter the European Union. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. Lampedusa and Malta, both islands less than an hour's flight from the North African coast, have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa, which numbers less than 6,000.","About 800 refugees were heading from Libya to Lampedusa, Italy .

"(CNN) -- Libya's transitional government would prefer to try former leader Moammar Gadhafi's son Saif al-Islam in a Libyan court despite an arrest warrant issued for him by the International Criminal Court, a spokesman said Sunday. The court's chief prosecutor said Friday it was having ""informal conversations"" about the surrender of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, who is wanted for crimes against humanity. But Luis Moreno-Ocampo said the court did not know his whereabouts and would not reveal with whom the court is talking. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi has realized there is no escape, and wants to negotiate a surrender to limit the damage, said Anees al-Sharif, spokesman for the National Transitional Council's Tripoli Military Council. But, he said, if the younger Gadhafi is captured in Libya, he will be tried there, as his alleged crimes were committed on Libyan soil. If he is captured outside Libya, the location of his trial will depend on where he is captured because of the ICC arrest warrants, he said. However, the NTC would prefer to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi in a Libyan court, as it would like to show that he could receive a fair trial, he said. Moreno-Ocampo said Friday that if Saif al-Islam Gadhafi is brought before the ICC, he will ""have all the rights and be protected,"" and will be allowed to present a defense. ""We believe we have a strong case,"" the prosecutor told CNN in an exclusive interview from The Hague. ""We believe he should be convicted."" The court believes Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, along with his father and his brother-in-law, Abdulla al-Sanussi, are responsible for crimes against humanity including murder and persecution across the country beginning in February amid anti-government demonstrations, Moreno-Ocampo said. Al-Sanussi served as the head of intelligence for Moammar Gadhafi, who was captured by opposition fighters and killed earlier this month. Moreno-Ocampo promised there would be no deals for Saif al-Islam Gadhafi's surrender.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Don't post rumors -- or else. That was Sina.com's message to millions of micro-bloggers recently, when China's leading content portal warned it will penalize users if they find them spreading false rumors on their Weibo account. Weibo is Sina's Twitter-like social media service, which boasts of 200 million registered users. Speaking at the China Digital Media Summit recently, Sina.com's CEO Charles Chao pledged to curb irresponsible rumors. ""Weibo is a microcosm of a big society and a society needs to be properly managed by regulations,"" he said. Chao said Sina has been working to set up a ""credibility system,"" which would rate Weibo posts. This, Chao said, will ""spread the real valuable information and punish those who make up rumors."" The punishment includes imposing a temporary freeze on Weibo accounts, from one week to one month. Observers of China's new media industry say this is another attempt by Beijing to tighten the control of the internet. Earlier this year, Chinese bloggers battled through targeted internet censorship in the wake of dissident artist Ai Weiwei's release after nearly three months in police custody. On Weibo words with the slightest linkage to Ai were banned, including ""release,"" ""AWW"" and ""the fat guy."" The phrase ""love the future,"" which looks and sounds like his name in Mandarin, was also blocked. ""There has been government concern about the way the internet spreads information for years,"" says Beijing-based media observer Jeremy Goldkorn. ""Sina, like all internet companies, has no choice but to work with the government, which is something they have always been good at doing."" In August, Sina sent out ""notices"" to all users citing reports circulating in cyberspace that were untrue. One claimed that the Red Cross Society has been selling blood to Chinese hospitals at 200 yuan per pack even though it had been donated for free. Weibo also set up an account intended to refute malicious rumors circulating among netizens. In a public statement issued in early September, Sina.com said Weibo Piyao would ""ensure the authenticity"" of information across the site. ""After the Wenzhou train accident, which saw a frenzy of angry posts on Weibo, the government wants internet companies to make sure that their websites do not pose any threat to social stability,"" said Goldkorn. The high-speed train collision killed 39 people and sparked a massive outpouring of anger directed at officials for their handling of the crash. Much of that outrage played out on Weibo. Weibo has long played host to fierce online debates about corruption and social injustice in China -- a delicate balancing act between meeting the expectations of a Web audience accustomed to speaking their minds and not offending the Chinese government to the point of a shut-down. ""Sina and other companies will have to regulate themselves and decide, in real time, what kinds of information to police,"" said Goldkorn. But he said it is unclear what criteria would be used to identify the rumors to censor. In a recent interview with CNN, the Sina.com founder declined to offer specific numbers about how many Sina employees were managing and censoring Weibo content, but he conceded that ""there are people working in terms of looking at the content itself and the message itself. ""There are a lot of rumors on the micro-blog itself, a lot of fraud on the micro-blog. There are a lot of things we need to take care of."" As if to reinforce that point, Beijing Communist Party chief Liu Qi recently visited Sina and Youku.com, China's leading video sharing website.

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- World powers beefed up financial and moral support for the Libyan opposition Thursday at an international coalition meeting aimed at charting the course of a post-Moammar Gadhafi Libya. Talk at the meeting in the United Arab Emirates focused on sustaining pressure on the embattled Libyan leader. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said ""numerous and continuous discussions"" on a transition of power were taking place among people close to Gadhafi. A spokesman for a Libyan opposition group told CNN that Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, was the primary negotiator for an exit plan for his father, but suggested the timing of the talks might not be good. ""I'm not sure there's a lot of people willing to listen right now,"" said Mohammed Ali Abdallah of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya. Abdallah said a southern front had opened up in the fighting and that Gadhafi's days were numbered. ""We are in the final phases,"" Abdallah said. ""Gadhafi's military power has significantly been reduced. He is basically rattled."" Clinton announced an additional $26 million in U.S. aid for the victims of Libya's ongoing war and said time was on the international coalition's side so long as Gadhafi faced sustained pressure. ""The violence must stop,"" she said. ""Gadhafi must go."" Britain's minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Alistair Burt, concurred: ""Gadhafi's regime is crumbling,"" he said in a statement. ""He has lost all legitimacy and must go immediately."" Promises of financial assistance flowed at the meeting, the third the international Libya group has held since war erupted. Italy pledged up to $580 million to the Libyan opposition's Transitional National Council -- which is facing a budget shortfall -- to cover its expenses, but not weapons, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Maurizio Massari said. And Kuwait is donating the $180 million it promised in April for humanitarian needs, said Sheikh Mohammed Sabah al Salman al Sabah, the Gulf nation's deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs. France, Italy and Qatar are among a small number of countries that have recognized the Transitional National Council as the legitimate government of Libya. While the United States has yet to officially recognize the rebel government, President Barack Obama ""has invited them to open an office in Washington,"" a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Clinton to the meeting in Abu Dhabi. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as a matter of practice for a press background briefing. In Washington, Obama's choice to lead the Defense Department, Leon Panetta, warned Thursday that if Gadhafi survives as leader of Libya, it could undermine American credibility. ""I think it impacts on our national security interests in the world if that happens,"" Panetta said at his Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing. The Obama administration has resisted congressional efforts to end or rein in the Libya mission, which started in March. The Abu Dhabi conference got underway as Gadhafi's forces launched a new attack against the rebel-held port city of Misrata, the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting in the months-long civil war that has killed thousands of civilians. The assault followed intense NATO bombardment of the capital, Tripoli. The alliance intervened in the conflict in March under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians as Gadhafi tried to crush the armed revolt against him. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN Thursday that the alliance has carried out more than 10,000 airstrikes that have damaged or destroyed more than 1,800 military targets, and have ""considerably degraded Gadhafi's war machine."" Rasmussen predicted the end was near for Gadhafi. ""Well no one knows exactly what will be the endgame, but I think the endgame is approaching, and this is the reason why we have strongly encouraged international organizations -- and notably the United Nations -- to speed up the preparations for that day,"" he said. But Gadhafi has vowed not to step down. ""We will not surrender,"" he said this week during a live audio broadcast as NATO warplanes bombed his Tripoli compound. In Misrata, rebels reported intense shelling by Gadhafi's forces from three sides. It was the bloodiest day of fighting in a week, said Dr. Khaled Abu Falgha, a spokesman at Misrata's Hekma hospital. Rebel spokesman Ibrahim Beit-elmal said Gadhafi forces failed Wednesday in their attempt to enter the city on the three front lines. He said the rebels had gotten most of their weapons by taking them from Gadhafi forces ""as spoils of war."" Beit-elmal said Gadhafi's latest tactic has been to send girls to join the front-line fighting. ""We arrested three, then let them go,"" he said. He said a high-ranking officer defected this week from Gadhafi's forces and joined the rebel forces on the front. In all, he said, 15 of Gadhafi's officers have surrendered and joined the rebel forces. In Zlitan, fighters attacked Gadhafi forces Thursday, taking four of their vehicles, but they failed to establish complete control, he said. This week, 22 rebel fighters were killed in the fighting, with many others wounded -- including 45 who were injured Wednesday, he said. Most of the casualties occurred on the western and eastern front lines. More than 100 members of Gadhafi's forces were killed Wednesday, half of them on the southern front (of Abdul-Rauf), said Fathi Bashaagha, Misrata military-NATO coordinator. More than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed since fighting began there in early February, including 686 civilians who lived in the city, he said. Misrata has been under siege for months by Gadhafi's forces, who have cut off all land access. The only escape route is by sea. The Transitional National Council, based in the de facto rebel capital of Benghazi in eastern Libya, has been seeking international support, including money, in its battle to oust Gadhafi. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor said a decision was expected within days from judges at the Hague on whether to charge Gadhafi and two others with crimes against humanity. Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is seeking the arrest of the Libyan leader and two relatives -- his son Saif al-Islam and brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi -- accusing them of ""widespread and systematic"" attacks on civilians as they struggle to hold power. Moreno-Ocampo told CNN that investigators have evidence that Gadhafi ordered rapes as part of his campaign to hold on to power. He said Libya's acts of brutality were not the works of low-level soldiers, but that orders were coming from the top. The arrests the court is seeking, Moreno-Ocampo said, would ""stop the rapes, stop the killings, stop the torture.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan government has denied rebel allegations that Moammar Gadhafi loyalists have been raping women, despite videos captured on cell phones that appear to show sexual abuse. The Gadhafi regime had initially not responded to CNN requests for comment on the abuse allegations but Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi said Friday at a news conference that women are ""our sisters"" and Libyan soldiers would not commit such heinous acts. ""This, like the other mercenaries lies, are false,"" al-Mahmudi said. Rebel fighters said they have found videos of rape on cell phones confiscated from captured or killed Libyan soldiers. CNN obtained a copy of a cell phone video that appears to show a woman being sexually abused. The person who gave the video to CNN said it was on a cell phone that was confiscated from a Gadhafi loyalist. Rebels say cell phone videos show rape, torture . It shows two men in civilian clothes standing over a naked woman who is bent over with her face on the floor. The man standing behind her is sodomizing her with what appears to be a broomstick. ""I can't bear it! I can't bear it!"" the woman cries. ""Let's push it farther,"" a male voice says off-camera. ""No, no, that's enough!"" the woman begs. Eventually, one of the men puts his sock-covered foot on her face. In Arab culture, that is considered a major insult. But in this case, it pales in comparison to what the victim is already enduring. Arabic speakers who listened to the video at CNN's request said the voices have Tripoli accents. There is no date on the video and the men in it are not wearing military uniforms. CNN has been unable to verify the video's authenticity, when it was shot, or by whom. The person who gave it to CNN asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by Libya's conservative society. Al-Mahmudi said there was no proof that Libyan soldiers were behind the abuse. It said the perpetrators could belong to the armed gangs leading the rebellion against Gadhafi. An opposition spokesman, however, said the video illustrated a pattern of abuse by Libyan soldiers. ""We were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war, because it was systematic,"" rebel spokesman Abdullah al-Kabeir said. The rebels have many videos showing other types of torture, and a few depict rape, he said. He did not know exactly how many videos there were showing abuse. One of the most famous faces of Libya's revolution, Eman al-Obeidy, dramatically claimed in March she had been gang-raped by pro-Gadhafi forces. She has since fled the country. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was ""deeply concerned"" over the reports of wide-scale rape in Libya and called for an investigation. ""Gadhafi's security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war, and the United States condemns this in the strongest possible terms,"" she said. CNN's Raja Razek, Amir Ahmed and Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","The rebels in Libya accuse Gadhafi loyalists of raping women .

"(CNN) -- Among the places that Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, visited during his visit to Tripoli this week was Jdeida prison. McCain said he wanted to see detention facilities firsthand. A fair system of justice -- absent for decades under strongman Moammar Gadhafi -- is an important step toward building a new Libya, the nation's Western allies have said. McCain found overcrowding and a backed-up judicial system. Still, he said he found it encouraging that Libya's new leadership had allowed him and three fellow Republican lawmakers inside the Jdeida. As of September 27, the two wings of Jdeida prison were housing about 1,500 detainees, according to Human Rights Watch, which over a one-month span inspected eight prisons in Tripoli and 12 smaller detention facilities. The group spoke with 53 detainees to compile a picture of what happens when a nation goes to war with itself; when Libyans fight Libyans and the thirst for vengeance runs deep in the veins of people who have suffered for so long. After Tripoli fell in August, militias took over providing security in the Libyan capital. But without strong central authority, the armed fighters have been able to act on their own accord. Thousand of people have been arrested without proper legal review, Human Rights Watch said. These militias and other security groups aligned with the National Transitional Council have punished those suspected of murder and rape so severely that some of their actions could amount to torture, the rights group said in a report published this week. Those interviewed told Human Rights Watch that they were beaten and given electric shocks. Some showed their scars as proof of their claims. One man wept openly in telling his story of abuse. A detainee identified as Ahmed said this: . ""They took an electric cable and started hitting me with it. They didn't use electricity, but they said that if I didn't talk, they would...They hit me with a butt of the Kalashnikov. They kicked me in the face and in the chest. One scratched me with the knife (bayonet) of the Kalashnikov."" Human Rights Watch said none of the detainees have ever faced a judge. ""After all that Libyans suffered in Moammar Gadhafi's jails, it's disheartening that some of the new authorities are subjecting detainees to arbitrary arrest and beatings today,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""The NTC owes it to the people of Libya to show that they will institute the rule of law from the start,' Stork said. An element of race was also disturbing. Many of those arrested were dark-skinned Libyans and sub-Saharan Africans accused of having fought for Gadhafi, who had been known to make use of such mercenaries. Abdulatif, a dark-complected Libyan, offered this account to Human Rights Watch: . ""The rebels were taking turns. There were too many to count. Every day, there was a new face. They zapped me with an electric stick on my legs and on my arms. They did that twice. They asked me questions when they did this.... They asked me again and hit me. I said 'No, I swear I didn't,' so they started electrocuting me. They wanted me to confess but in the wrong way. They hit me every day. They used falaga (beating on the bottom of the feet]) and hit me on my back, all over my body, and slapped my face. They did this three times."" Mahmoud Jabril, Libya's de facto prime minister, recognized the problem and said it needed urgent attention. ""Prisoner abuse of any kind is not acceptable,"" he told Human Rights Watch. ""We joined the revolution to end such mistreatment, not to see it continue in any form."" The global rights monitoring organization urged Libya's leaders to bring militia and security units under unified control and set clear standards for conduct.","Human Rights Watch spoke with detainees in Libyan jails .

"(CNN) -- Eman al-Obeidy, the woman who claims forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi raped her, spoke Tuesday with her mother, who has come to her defense, for the first time since her ordeal began. Al-Obeidy told Aisha Ahmad that a court employee pulled a weapon on her when she went to a courthouse. Al-Obeidy, who burst into a Tripoli hotel last month to tell her harrowing story to journalists, told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an emotional phone interview that the administrative court employee threatened her life. ""The people came and started pulling him,"" said al-Obeidy, who related the incident to her mother, also on the phone. ""The whole day in the court they were saying we are going to kill this failure who reports on our brigades."" A car took her home, al-Obeidy said. ""They don't want me to go to the court at all."" CNN could not independently verify the 29-year-old law school graduate's claims. Al-Obeidy, who is no longer in custody after authorities rushed her away from the hotel, said she still fears for her safety in Tripoli, which she called a ""large prison."" Rebel leaders ""disappointed"" by NATO's efforts . She told ""AC360"" that Gadhafi forces took her passport and would not let her cross the border into Tunisia. Her mother, Aisha Ahmad, who lives in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk, urged al-Obeidy to return to her parents ""before they kill you."" ""You have Allah with you, you have Allah with you, you have Allah with you,"" Ahmad said. ""Do not change your statement."" Ahmad tried to comfort her distraught daughter, saying, ""they lie in the Libyan media."" ""I dream of them trying to kill me,"" said al-Obeidy, who has spent time with her sister and is concerned about the health of her father back home. Ahmad told al-Obeidy the world is praying for her and not to be afraid. ""I'm not afraid,"" the daughter replied. ""The one thing that really bothers me is that I'm far from you. Nobody is standing by me here in Tripoli."" Asked by Cooper if she were still trying to leave the capital, al-Obeidy said, ""How can I possibly get out of Tripoli when Tripoli is under siege? There are only two ways to get to my family, by way of Tunisia or through the eastern zone and they're both under siege."" Al-Obeidy, who was encouraged by Ahmad to pray and keep her faith, was grateful for the opportunity to speak with her family. ""We'd like to thank the American people and every person who tried to make my voice heard,"" she said. In two previous telephone interviews with Cooper, al-Obeidy spoke about her alleged abuse. At times in tears, at other times defiant, she recalled men pouring alcohol into her eyes and repeatedly using rifles to sodomize her. Al-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse. She has said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials, who initially called her mentally ill, drunk and a prostitute, have ruined her reputation. Al-Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on March 26 while international journalists staying there were having breakfast. She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli, held against her will for two days and beaten and raped by 15 men. When CNN saw her in March, al-Obeidy's legs and face were bruised and she had blood on her right inner thigh. Her visible injuries appeared to support her allegations, but CNN could not independently verify her story. CNN's ""AC360"" spoke with al-Obeidy Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.

"Washington (CNN) -- Preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon is a national security interest of both Israel and the United States, President Barack Obama said Sunday in calling for continued diplomatic efforts but also pledging that all options -- including a military effort -- remain viable. ""All elements of American power"" remain an option to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power, including ""a military effort to be prepared for any contingency,"" Obama told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobby group. At the same time, Obama made clear that he preferred diplomacy over war both as a principle and in the case of Iran, and he warned that ""too much loose talk of war"" with Iran only benefits the Iranian government by driving up the price of oil. The remarks came against a backdrop of growing international concern that Israel may attack an Iranian nuclear facility. Israel and the United States accuse Tehran of seeking nuclear weapons despite the Iranian regime's insistence that its program is for peaceful purposes. Obama's speech was intended to allay concerns in Israel and in the American Jewish community that he lacked commitment to support an Israeli attack. The president stated his policy was not containment of a nuclear Iran, but preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. At the same time, he emphasized that Iran ""should not doubt Israel's sovereign right to make its own decisions about what is required to meet its security needs."" While Obama's position was consistent with his past pronouncements, his specific reference to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon -- rather than the capability of building a nuclear weapon -- maintained what some consider to be a difference from Israel's position. Israeli officials say that if Iran was able to enrich weapons-grade uranium, it would potentially cross the ""red line"" of nuclear weapons capability that Israel fears. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with Obama on Monday at the White House to discuss that issue and others before speaking at the AIPAC conference. In a statement issued after Obama's speech, Netanyahu expressed appreciation for the president's position that all options were on the table to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. ""I also appreciated the fact that he made clear that when it comes to a nuclear-armed Iran, containment is simply not an option, and equally in my judgment, perhaps most important of all, I appreciated the fact that he said that Israel must be able to defend itself, by itself, against any threat,"" Netanyahu said. To Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council who wrote the book ""Treacherous Alliance - The Secret Dealings of Iran, Israel and the United States,"" Obama' s speech showed that a difference continues to exist between the United States and Israel on Iran. Israel ""argues that the only acceptable guarantee that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon is for Iran to have no enrichment program,"" Parsi said in an email. ""The Obama administration puts the red line not at enrichment -- which is permitted under international law -- but at nuclear weapons. This is a clearer, more enforceable red line that also has the force of international law behind it."" In his remarks Sunday, Obama defended what he called his administration's consistent record of supporting Israel economically, diplomatically and militarily -- including U.S. military assistance and blocking anti-Israel efforts at the United Nations. Noting the current political season in the United States with an upcoming election in November, Obama also said U.S. support for Israel should be a bipartisan issue. He dismissed criticism of his record by Republicans, saying ""it's not backed up by the facts."" ""There should not be a shred of doubt by now, when the chips are down, I have Israel's back,"" Obama said to applause. Before Obama spoke, Republican operative Liz Cheney said during a panel discussion that no U.S. president had done more to undermine Israel than Obama. David Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee, said he doubted Obama's speech would satisfy everyone. While some will embrace Obama's core message of an ironclad commitment to Israel, others will question why Obama didn't go further in specifying his intentions regarding Iran, Harris said. In addition, Harris said he expected the Republican presidential candidates, when addressing the conference this week, to ""mince few words on Iran,"" something that is easier to do ""as they don't have to directly bear the consequences of their words."" In an unusual move last week, the Democratic National Committee sent out a video aimed at fending off potential Republican attacks over Obama's Israel policies. Earlier Sunday at the opening of the AIPAC conference, Israeli President Shimon Peres accused Iran of plotting to control the Middle East, and warned ""it will be stopped."" Israel ""does not seek"" war, Peres said, adding: ""Peace is always our first option. But, if we are forced to fight, trust me, we shall prevail."" Speaking just before Obama, Peres said,""The United States and Israel share the same goal: to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. There is no space between us. Our message is clear: Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon."" ""Iran is an evil, cruel, morally corrupt regime,"" Peres said. ""It is based on destruction. It is an affront to human dignity. Iran is the center, the sponsor, the financier of world terror. Iran is a danger to the entire world. It threatens Berlin as well as Madrid, Delhi as well as Bangkok."" Israel blames Iran for recent attacks apparently aimed at Israeli diplomats in Thailand and India. ""Iran's ambition is to control the Middle East, so it can control a major part of the world's economy,"" Peres said. ""It must be stopped. And it will be stopped."" Obama has argued that a military attack on Iran may not be the key to resolving nuclear concerns. ""At a time when there is not a lot of sympathy for Iran and its only real ally, (Syria) is on the ropes, do we want a distraction in which suddenly Iran can portray itself as a victim?"" Obama said last week in an interview with The Atlantic. He made the same contention Sunday, saying history showed that the only way to truly halt nuclearization is when countries halt their programs themselves. In his speech Sunday, Peres helped create a welcome reception for Obama. ""I know your commitment to Israel is deep and profound,"" Peres said. ""Under your leadership, security cooperation between the U.S. and Israel has reached its highest level. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a friend in the White House."" The remarks may help shore up election-year support for Obama among Jewish voters. In his later remarks, Obama praised Peres as a leader and a living example of Israel's history and values, and announced he would award Peres the presidential Medal of Freedom -- America's highest civilian honor -- at the White House later this year. The audience responded with a long ovation that Obama joined from the podium, and Netanyahu later said in his statement that he congratulated Peres on the Medal of Freedom and called it ""a great honor for the State of Israel."" While the prime minister is the head of Israel's government, Peres holds some authority as president including serving as head of state and appointing some senior officials. On the other major issue of U.S.-Israeli relations, Peres also called the principle of a two-state solution with Palestinians ""a paramount Israeli interest."" He noted that he meets ""from time to time"" with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. ""They need and they want peace. I believe that peace is possible. They are our partners for peace. Not Hamas."" Peres also had a message for Syrians facing a violent crackdown on an uprising against the regime. ""The Middle East is undergoing its greatest storm in history, with horrible bloodshed in Syria, where a tyrant is killing his people, killing his children,"" Peres said. ""I admire the courage of the Syrian people. And I wish them peace and freedom from the depths of all of our hearts. In spite of the storm, we have to reach out to the young generation in the Arab world, to those who strive for freedom, democracy and peace.""

"(CNN) -- The hostage crisis in eastern Algeria is over, but the questions remain. Among them, exactly how many people are unaccounted for at a remote natural gas facility after three days of chaos that ended Saturday, leaving at least 23 hostages and dozens of Islamist militants dead. Some 685 Algerian workers and 107 foreigners were freed, the Algerian Interior Ministry said. Britain's BP said Sunday four of its workers remain unaccounted for. And Norway's Statoil said five of its employees were missing, while 12 others are now home in Norway, Algeria and Canada. ""Search efforts are ongoing at the gas installation, looking for more possible victims. I fear the numbers will be updated with more victims later today when the search operation is expected to end,"" said Mohammed Said, Algeria's communication minister. The attackers came from six countries -- only three were Algerian -- and included Arabs and Africans, Said told state-run Radio Algeria. Algeria's military found numerous ""foreign military uniforms"" in its sweep of the In Amenas facility, its Interior Ministry said. Mauritania's Sahara Media news agency said Sunday it had a video from Moktar Belmoktar, who leads the Al-Mulathameen Brigade associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb that regional media have reported was behind the attack. In it, Belmoktar said, ""We at al Qaeda are claiming responsibility of this blessed guerrilla operation."" Belmoktar has communicated with this and other news sites before, said Andrew Lebovich, a Senegal-based security analyst. But the news agency did not post the video, and CNN has not independently confirmed its authenticity. Eleven former hostages -- among them British citizens -- have gotten medical treatment and psychological counseling from the U.S. military at a U.S. naval base in Sigonella, Italy, a U.S. official said Sunday. The hostages were brought from Algeria to the base Friday, the official said, and are being flown to their home countries as their conditions warrant. The remains of one American hostage were also brought to the base, the official said. In a statement Saturday night, the White House said it was in close contact with Algeria's government to ""gain a fuller understanding of what took place."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague echoed those remarks, adding his government is ""working hard to get definitive information"" about each individual. Japan has 10 citizens -- likely affiliated with JGC Corp., an engineering firm that was involved in gas production in In Amenas -- who are yet to be confirmed safe, in addition to a number of dead. Opinion: Algeria crisis is a wakeup call for America . Such Islamist militant activity is not new to Africa, including recent violence in Mali and Somalia. Algeria's status as Africa's largest natural gas producer and a major supplier of the product to Europe heightens its importance to those who want to invest there. Yet that interest is coupled with pressure to make sure foreign nationals, and their business ventures, are safe. Youcef Yousfi, Algeria's energy and mining minister, insisted Sunday his country can keep its gas facilities secure and ruled out foreign forces coming in to help. ""We are going to strengthen security, and we rely first on our means and resources,"" Yousfi said, according to the official Algerian Press Service. Raids turn deadly . Militants in pickup trucks struck the sprawling gas complex about 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the Libyan border at dawn Wednesday, gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up. The In Amenas plant is run by Algeria's state oil company, in cooperation with foreign firms such as Statoil and BP, and because of that employed workers from several countries. The kidnappers wielded AK-47 rifles and put explosive-laden vests on some hostages, according to a U.S. State Department official. Algeria said the attack was in retaliation for allowing France to use Algerian airspace for an offensive against Islamist militants in neighboring Mali. And Sahara News' report Sunday claimed Belmoktar said ""40 immigrant Jihadists and supporters of Muslim countries"" led the siege in retaliation for the Mali offensive. Read more: Mali takes key town as nations ready more troops . But regional analysts believe it was too sophisticated to have been planned in just days. On Thursday, Algerian special forces moved in because the government said the militants wanted to flee to Mali. The Islamic extremists also planned to blow up the gas installation and rigged it with mines throughout, the U.S. official said. Thursday's military incursion succeeded in freeing some hostages -- but not all. Some survivors described their harrowing escapes by rigging up disguises and sneaking to safety with locals, with at least one survivor running for his life with plastic explosives strapped around his neck. Several hostages died. And the Algerian military came under criticism from some quarters for unnecessarily endangering hostages' lives. Undeterred, the government followed with a second push Saturday. That assault killed the remaining hostage-takers but resulted in more hostage deaths. The army intervened ""to avoid a bloody turning point of events in this extremely dangerous situation,"" the Algerian Interior Ministry said Saturday. ""It was clear that the terrorists were determined to escape the country with the captives and to bomb the gas installations."" On Sunday, an American lawmaker said the Algerian government turned down U.S. offers to help during the crisis. ""They decided they were going to handle it their way,"" said Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who is chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. ""They did not want us or the other hostage nations involved in the decision-making."" British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond called the loss of life ""appalling and unacceptable,"" while laying blame solely on the terrorists. Countries mourn dead, try to track down missing . While the military part of the operation is over, the searching and mourning is not for people in countries worldwide. In addition to combing the sprawling desert site, Algerian forces are searching hospitals and medical centers around the country, as well as towns and villages near the targeted site, according to a statement Sunday from Statoil.

"(CNN) -- An Iranian delegation met with officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria, on Monday as diplomatic wrangling continues over Tehran's controversial nuclear program. These are the first negotiations between Iran and the agency in three months -- the two sides held talks in Tehran in January and February, according to Iran's state-run Press TV . The aim of the current meeting is to ""devise a framework for answering questions about Tehran's nuclear energy program,"" Press TV said in an article on its website, citing the Iranian ambassador to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh. In March, the IAEA noted what it called a sharp and troubling increase in Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. Iran denies allegations that it is working on nuclear weapons and says its program is solely directed toward developing civilian nuclear energy. But Western powers and Israel say they think Iran is evading international inspections and intent on developing nuclear weapons. This sentiment has led to sweeping sanctions targeting Iran's economy, government and its leaders. Key world powers met with Iran last month about its intentions for its nuclear program and announced that the next meeting would take place in late May in Baghdad. The talks involved the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, France, Russia, China, and Britain -- as well as Germany, referred to as the P5+1. CNN's Ben Brumfield and Marilia Brochetto contributed to this report.","Iranian officials arrive at the offices of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Vienna .

"(CNN) -- Arab modernity. Why is it that at the beginning of the 21st century the Arab world seems stuck in time? Why are most Arabs still ruled by kings or military dictatorships? And specifically, why has the most populous Arab nation, Egypt, been governed by one man for nearly three decades? President Hosni Mubarak, a former general, came to power in the aftermath of Anwar Sadat's assassination in October 1981. He has ruled Egypt ever since under a state of emergency. Last week, Mubarak's regime extended for another two years a Draconian emergency law that permits police to detain individuals indefinitely, prohibits unauthorized assembly and severely restricts freedom of speech. We Americans should care about this state of affairs. Mubarak's regime exists in part because our tax dollars subsidize this dictatorship to the tune of several billion dollars a year. We also support the Saudi royalty. And although President Obama and previous presidents have often spoken eloquently about the need for democratization, Egypt's elections are anything but democratic. Why does nothing change? I spent virtually my entire childhood in the Middle East, and though it is not my home, I worry about it as if it were my home. I mourn for it, I fear for it -- and I also greatly fear it. Modernity, if not ever completely defeated, seems to have been put on hold throughout much of the Arab world. A worn-out, 82-year-old pharaoh still reigns in Egypt. Royalty still rules in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Islamists still seem to be winning hearts and minds in a political vacuum. The fact is that the Egypt of my adolescence in the 1960s was a more democratic and secular society than today. My father was an American Foreign Service officer stationed in Cairo from 1965-67. An army colonel, Gamal Abdel Nasser, was Egypt's virtual dictator. But Nasser had at least been elected president in 1956. He was a wildly popular and populist politician throughout Egypt. Sadat was never as popular as Nasser. He had catered to the Islamists in the aftermath of Nasser's death, thinking they were not dangerous, and ending up being killed by them. Neither he nor Mubarak could have survived a truly democratic election. Nasser became an autocrat, but at least he offered the Arabs a secular vision. Even today, Nasser remains emblematic of a lost era when hope still existed among Arabs of all classes and tribes for a modern, secular and progressive Arab nation. Suave and articulate, Nasser exuded a quiet intelligence. His colleagues knew him to be incorruptible. He had no personal peccadilloes, aside from smoking three packs of cigarettes a day. He loved American films. His good friend the newspaper editor Mohammed Heikel claimed that Nasser loved watching Frank Capra's syrupy Christmas tale, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" His favorite American writer was Mark Twain. He spent an hour or two each evening reading American, French and Arabic magazines. His closest political enemies at home were the Muslim Brotherhood, political theocrats who then attracted an insignificant following. Today, the Muslim Brotherhood would undoubtedly win any democratic election in Egypt. But back in the 1960s, most young Arab men aspired to a secular modernity. They wanted to be engineers or doctors or lawyers -- and they admired, like Nasser did, American culture. I lived in Cairo's upscale suburban community of Maadi, about eight miles south of the city on the eastern bank of the Nile River. I am startled to realize now that another resident of Maadi was the young Ayman al-Zawahiri. In 1965, the future doctor and No. 2 leader of al Qaeda was attending Maadi's state-run secondary school. He was exactly my age. And like me, al-Zawahiri used to watch Hollywood films on an outdoor screen at the Maadi Sports Club. Al-Zawahiri once aspired to a career in public health. His ambitions were the same as most young Arab men in the Nasser era. Even then he was a practicing Muslim. And his religious sensibilities did not become politically radicalized until after Nasser ordered the execution of the Muslim Brotherhood's leader, Sayyid Qutb, in 1966. But I would argue that al-Zawahiri and other young men would never have taken the road to jihadist terror had it not been for the June 1967 war. Sadik al-Azm, the Yale-educated, Syrian philosopher, described Nasser's defeat in the June war as a ""lightning bolt"" and a ""shock"" to the Arab ethos. Nasser's humiliation spelled the defeat of the idea of a secular path to Arab modernity. Nasser's once powerful notion that the Arabic-speaking peoples of the Middle East could unite under the banner of a progressive Arab nationalist movement was now discredited. Over time, political Islam moved into this political vacuum. Al-Zawahiri  himself wrote in his 2001 memoir that the ""Naksa"" -- the June 1967 defeat -- ""influenced the awakening of the jihadist movement."" Al-Zawahiri  today is hiding in a cave in Afghanistan, or dodging drone missile attacks in Pakistan. Someday he will be a dead man, along with his pitiful co-conspirator Osama bin Laden. The jihadists don't have any thing real to offer the Arabs of the 21st century. They can't put bread on the table in this era of globalization. Al-Azm believes the jihadists have already lost: ""There may be intermittent battles in the decades to come, with many innocent victims. But the number of supporters of armed Islamism is unlikely to grow, its support throughout the Arab Muslim world will likely decline. ... September 11 signaled the last gasp of Islamism rather than the beginnings of its global challenge."" I hope so. But if Al-Azm is right, the new generation of young Arab men and women must find hope for their lives elsewhere. And so long as tired old kings and pharaohs smother their rights to democratic elections and free speech, the jihadists will still offer a desperate alternative. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Kai Bird.","Kai Bird: Why does Hosni Mubarak still rule in Egypt, royalty in Jordan, Saudi Arabia?

He says Nasser's defeat in June 1967 war was a shock to Arab ethos, end to his dream .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The alleys and archways along Rashid Street in central Tripoli were plunged in darkness this weekend, as the Libyan capital struggled to cope with widespread shortages of electricity. After sunset, the only light in one corner cafe came from two candles. Their flickering glow barely lit the faces of men seated at a handful of tables, where they were breaking their Ramadan fast. Nearby, residents trudged down the center of empty streets enveloped in darkness. Some men played music from parked cars. Others sat silently in doorways, their presence only marked by the glow of a cigarette butt. ""It's a disaster. My father's neighborhood hasn't had electricity for five straight days,"" said one Libyan man who asked not to be named, for fear of attracting the ire of government authorities. He said he evacuated his entire family to Egypt and was staying behind to keep an eye on his property. The rapid deterioration of power supplies in Tripoli over the past two weeks has come as a shock to many Libyans. Some residents complain pumps have stopped channeling water to their apartment buildings, leaving them without both water and light. This week, a nightly talk show that fiercely supports Moammar Gadhafi on state television addressed the growing problem of the black-outs. ""The Tripoli power cuts are caused by NATO and rebel attacks on power stations,"" announced a television presenter on Thursday. Frustration could be felt at a recent government press conference, when a Libyan man repeatedly pressed Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim on why some Tripoli neighborhoods had power while others suffered black-outs for days. ""Surely a large country like Libya doesn't depend on one power station,"" the Libyan man said. Kaim responded by accusing NATO warplanes and Libyan rebels of attacking power stations, high-voltage lines and pipelines. In an e-mail to CNN, NATO military spokesman denied accusations that the alliance targeted Libyan electrical power lines. ""There is no evidence to suggest that if the country's power lines have been damaged, such an event could be linked to a NATO strike,"" the spokesman wrote. The Gadhafi regime is struggling under an international blockade of its seaports and airports. Shortages of gas have been a fact of daily life for months now, with drivers waiting days in line at gas stations for fuel. ""One liter of petrol, 4 dinars!"" a taxi driver yelled on Saturday, as he thumped a plastic jug full of fuel sitting in the back passenger seat of his car. That is roughly the equivalent of 13 dollars for a gallon of gasoline, a huge price surge in a country long accustomed to cheap, heavily subsidized fuel. Until anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted last February, Libya was a major oil-exporting country. Since then, oil exports have slowed to a trickle. Hopes for a reprieve in the fuel shortages were dashed this week when the regime in Tripoli announced rebels somehow seized control of the fuel tanker ship Cartagena off the coast of Malta. Kaim denounced the capture of the ship and its cargo of tens of thousands of tons of gasoline, calling it an act of international piracy. ""The tanker was taken with the help of NATO to Benghazi and it arrived at 1:30 in the afternoon to Benghazi seaport,"" Kaim said on Friday. ""The age of piracy is coming back to the Mediterranean because of NATO,"" Kaim concluded. The Reuters news agency has distributed video filmed Thursday of the tanker Cartagena sailing into the Libyan rebel capital of Benghazi. According to the energy trade publication Petroleum Economist, the Cartagena was the property of the Libyan state-owned shipping company GNMTC. ""The MV Cartagena was outside Maltese territorial waters,"" an official from the Maltese Foreign Ministry wrote to CNN in an e-mail, after being asked about allegations of the ship's capture by rebels. A NATO spokesman in Naples, Italy, wrote to CNN, ""On the afternoon of 3 August a NATO warship established visual and voice contact with the MT Cartagena and found the crew cooperative. NATO concluded that the ship could proceed to its next port of call Benghazi. Following this decision the NATO warships returned to their patrol duties and did not escort the ship to Benghazi as suggested in some media reports."" Meanwhile, tempers were flaring at the Ghot al-Shaal shopping district in western Tripoli, where almost all the shops were dark and stifling hot due to the lack of electricity and air-conditioning. ""We've had no power all day, how are we going to work like this?"" said one angry merchant as he stalked out of his women's clothing shop. ""At a time like this people want air-conditioning,"" said 26-year old Ridha Abdullah, who runs a children's clothing store. Abdullah said the power outages began within the last two weeks. ""God willing it will be fixed, if NATO would stop and leave us alone to resolve our problems,"" Abdullah added. At a nearby fruit and vegetable bazaar, some passersby yelled pro-Gadhafi chants and vowed to stand strong against rebel and NATO attacks. One man carrying a shopping bag stopped to accuse foreign journalists of being the cause of the crisis. But, as is often the case in public places, other Libyans discreetly approached CNN reporters to whisper messages of dissent against the Gadhafi regime. ""The government is lying and the rebels will be in Tripoli soon,"" one man said nervously, before quickly walking away. ""Gadhafi not good,"" said another young man, who smiled at a reporter before he climbed into a car and drove away. One store owner decided to deal with summer heat and lack of electricity by simply closing shop early. ""I'm going to the beach to cool down,"" the man said with a smile, as he pulled down the heavy metal shutters that covered his shop windows.","Government blames NATO, rebels .

"(CNN) -- In a little more than three months, Manti Te'o probably will be drafted by an NFL team and sign a multimillion dollar deal. Before teams sink that much money into players, they have questions. With the revelation that the football feel-good story of the year centered on the Notre Dame linebacker's love for a woman who never existed, many people have questions for Te'o -- a lot of questions. And as each question in the saga gets answered -- none publicly by Te'o --- it seems another one, or two, or three, crop up. For instance, why did Te'o tell reporters before the Heisman Trophy presentation on December 8 that he ""lost both my grandparents and my girlfriend to cancer,"" when two days earlier the woman he thought was dead called him on his cellphone? Why did he tell a Sports Illustrated reporter in October that Kekua came to one of his games then issue a statement this week that he never met her? Who is now behind the one of the Twitter accounts associated with Lennay Kekua, a woman who apparently never lived, let alone died, in September before Te'o, who called her his girlfriend, played one of the biggest games of the young season? The Te'o hoax in 30 posts . A tweet Thursday purportedly from the fictional girlfriend promised she would have a big announcement that would help sort out details of the story, but the tweet was merely a joke about Te'o. Two other tweets on the page were retweets from the verified account of Te'o. ""@LennayKay I miss you!"" a November 6 tweet from Te'o said. On September 12, Te'o tweeted ""@LennayKay you will always be with me wherever I go!"" It was unclear Thursday whether the person Te'o tweeted to in September used it again after reports broke of a hoax or whether someone created a new account with the same user name. The airing of the bizarre story began Wednesday, when sports website Deadspin published a piece dismissing as a hoax the existence of Te'o's girlfriend -- the one who he said died around the same time as his grandmother while his team marched toward the BCS National Championship Game. Then Wednesday, the university held a news conference saying Te'o was the victim of a ""elaborate hoax."" And Te'o, the Heisman Trophy runner-up, released a statement saying he was embarrassed that he was the victim of a ""sick joke."" The bizarre developments left many wondering if they, instead of Te'o, were led on. ""Te'o's story that he is completely innocent in this does not really ring true to us,"" Timothy Burke, co-author of the Deadspin article, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night. Pete Thamel, the Sports Illustrated writer who published a transcript of his interview with Te'o, said he thinks the star linebacker was duped. ""If he was acting he deserves an Oscar nomination,"" Thamel said. ""The depth and the detail of this scam is mindboggling, but I do think Te'o ... he caught the wave of this story, maybe exaggerated the depths of their relationship a little. But at the end of the day, we need to hear from Manti Te'o."" Doubters wonder if Heisman Trophy a factor in hoax . The hoax . The story of the girlfriend came to light in September as Notre Dame continued its improbable undefeated season, and Te'o, a relentless tackler, was beginning to emerge as a front-runner for the prestigous Heisman Trophy. He led the Fighting Irish, amassing double-digit tackle games and becoming the face of one of the best defenses in the nation. In September and October, Te'o told interviewers that his girlfriend and grandmother had died within hours of each other. The girlfriend, a 22-year-old Stanford University student, died of leukemia, he said. The twin losses inspired him to honor them with sterling play on the field, Te'o said. He led his team to a 20-3 routing of Michigan State after he heard the news. ""I miss 'em, but I know that I'll see them again one day,"" he told ESPN. Opinion: Te'o tale a mirror to our gullibility? It was indeed a gripping interest story of determination. And the media ran with it. No one bothered to seek out Kekua's family until Deadspin, acting on an anonymous e-mail received last week, started poking around. ""What do you do when you first want to know something? You Google it, right?"" Burke said on CNN. ""And Google searches for 'Lennay Kekua' only showed up articles about her dying, and inspiring Manti Te'o. ""There's no evidence of her existing in any way, other than, you know, after she had allegedly died. And we thought that was a little weird."" Te'o's grandmother died in September, Deadspin said. But there was no Social Security Administration record of Kekua's death. The Birth and Death Registration Office in Orange County, California, told CNN it had no record of Kekua, nor does the county coroner. Deadspin called mortuaries and funeral homes in Carson, California, where Kekua was reportedly buried -- but came up empty. The website sought out the person whose picture had been presented as that of Kekua and tracked her down. Timeline: How the story unfolded . She was alive, didn't have leukemia and had never met Te'o. ""That sort of opened everything up,"" Burke said. The revelation prompted the Notre Dame athletics director to call a news conference Wednesday. There was no way for Te'o to know the relationship was a hoax because it had been conducted strictly online and on the phone, said director Jack Swarbrick. The pair had set up several meetings, including in Hawaii, where Te'o grew up -- but Kekua never showed, Swarbrick said. The university said it did not know how many people were in on the ruse. According to Swarbrick, Te'o received a call from a woman claiming to be his girlfriend on December 6, telling him she was not dead. Those calls continued, but Te'o did not answer, he said. The Heisman Trophy was awarded two days later, and Te'o made comments about losing relatives to cancer before he finished second in the award voting to quarterback Johnny Manziel of Texas A & M. The Stanford University registrar's office told CNN that it has never had a student registered in Kekua's name or using an alternate spelling. ""Outside of a few Twitter and Instagram accounts, there's no online evidence that Lennay Kekua ever existed,"" Deadspin contends. ""There was no Lennay Kekua."" Te'o in his own words . Her 'soulful eyes' So, how did the two fall in love? According to the South Bend Tribune in Indiana -- the newspaper of Notre Dame's hometown, the two met -- yes, met -- after a football game in Palo Alto, California, in 2009. ""Their stares got pleasantly tangled, then Manti Te'o extended his hand to the stranger with a warm smile and soulful eyes,"" the paper gushed. ""They could have just as easily brushed past each other and into separate sunsets. Te'o had plenty to preoccupy himself that November weekend in Palo Alto, Calif., back in 2009."" The article went on to say: ""Lennay Kekua was a Stanford student and Cardinal football fan when the two exchanged glances, handshakes and phone numbers that fateful weekend three seasons ago."" Te'o's father, Brian, was quoted in the article: ""They started out as just friends. Every once in a while, she would travel to Hawaii, and that happened to be the time Manti was home, so he would meet with her there. But within the last year, they became a couple."" The newspaper said Wednesday it based Teo's story on information from the linebacker, his family members and coaches -- and moved the story to its archives. But as Thamel reported Thursday, Te'o said they met through a cousin. ""The only time he didn't speak with confidence was when I asked how they met,"" he wrote. I didn't press him, as it was clearly something he didn't want to share. I suspected they may have met online, understood he wouldn't have wanted that public and moved on."" Media reports indicate the parents never met Kekua. Social media jump all over story . Te'o was in Florida training for the NFL Scouting Combine, where draft prospects showcase their abilities for teams. He didn't meet with reporters or answer phone calls to his room on Thursday. He tried to clear things up with a statement Wednesday saying he ""developed an emotional relationship with a woman I met online."" ""We maintained what I thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone, and I grew to care deeply about her,"" he said in the statement. ""To realize that I was the victim of what was apparently someone's sick joke and constant lies was, and is, painful and humiliating,"" the statement continued. ""It further pains me that the grief I felt and the sympathies expressed to me at the time of my grandmother's death in September were in any way deepened by what I believed to be another significant loss in my life.""

"(CNN) -- A Canadian citizen was sentenced Thursday in Chicago to 14 years in prison for aiding a plot to attack a Danish newspaper that published cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed. Tahawwur Rana, 52, was convicted in June 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support in the plot against the Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten newspaper and of providing material support to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e Tayyiba-terror organization. Rana, a native of Pakistan, was found not guilty of providing support for the November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which more than 160 people were killed, including six Americans. David Coleman Headley, an alleged co-conspirator of Rana's, performed surveillance prior to those Mumbai attacks. Headley pleaded guilty in March 2010 to a dozen terror charges, including aiding and abetting the murders of the Americans in the Mumbai assault. He agreed to cooperate with the government and avoid a possible death penalty. Headley is due to be sentenced next Thursday and is facing up to life in prison. Headley testified against Rana, whom he had known since the two attended the same high school in Pakistan. Rana had a Chicago-based immigration business and Headley said he pretended to be working for that business during overseas travels as a cover for his surveillance activities. Headley took part in the plot against the Danish paper, as well as the Mumbai operation. At Rana's trial, the defense argued that he had no idea what Headley was up to, and that Headley was lying to avoid the death penalty. The plot to attack the Danish newspaper was never carried out, but the government said the plan was to behead employees and toss their heads into the street. ""This serious prison sentence should go a long way towards convincing would-be terrorists that they can't hide behind the scenes, lend support to the violent aims of terrorist organizations, and escape detection and punishment,"" said Gary Shapiro, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.","Businessman sentenced to 14 years .

"(CNN) -- Italian authorities found 25 dead bodies in a boat that was carrying refugees and was discovered off the coast of the southern island of Lampedusa, an Italian official news agency reported Monday. The bodies of the victims -- all males -- were found during an inspection of the boat after it was accompanied ashore, the ANSA news agency said. Officials could not immediately say how the men died nor did they know from where the boat departed. The boat was also carrying 271 other passengers, including 36 women and 21 children, the news agency said. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter European Union countries. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa in the last year. Lampedusa and Malta, both islands less than an hour's flight from the North African coast, have taken the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered Lampedusa's residents, who number about 6,000.","The deceased are all men, the ANSA news agency says .

"Waretown, New Jersey (CNN) -- In the shadow of the nation's oldest operating nuclear power plant, Alfonse Esposito fishes along Oyster Creek in central New Jersey, where he's caught and eaten bluefish and kingfish for 37 years. ""I never had a problem with the fish. I'm fine,"" says the retiree. ""There's not anything wrong."" But there is, warns Waretown Mayor Joe Lachawiec, who used to fish here himself. He worries about leaks of radioactive water the Oyster Creek Generating Station revealed two years ago, shortly after the nuclear power plant's owner, Exelon Corp., won a license renewal from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In April 2009 Exelon discovered two leaks in underground pipes, allowing radioactive tritium to enter the groundwater. Later that year, in August, Exelon discovered yet another leak in a six-inch aluminum pipe. ""I know that tritium is a dangerous radioactive material,"" Lachawiec said. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. It occurs naturally. But it's also a byproduct of nuclear power generation. Because of the leaks, tritium seeped into the aquifers directly underneath the power plant. Those underground waterways eventually feed into wells that provide drinking water. Monitoring wells in New Jersey's Cohansey aquifer last year detected tritium levels of 4 million picocuries per liter, 200 times what the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. Such radioactive spills are a problem nationwide. More than half of the country's 65 nuclear power plant sites have suffered significant tritium leaks or spills, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The worst was at the Braidwood plant, 60 miles southwest of Chicago, also owned by Exelon, which leaked more than 6 million gallons of contaminated water, causing some tritium to enter a drinking water well. Many of the leaks are the result of corroding underground pipes that have not been maintained. That can lead to a variety of radioactive compounds entering groundwater, but tritium travels fastest through the soil. The commission did not order Exelon to clean up the spill at Oyster Creek, an example, some scientists claim, of the agency's failure to fully protect the public. ""The NRC's almost acting like they're waiting till somebody dies till they enforce the regulation. Tombstone regulation -- that's too high a price to pay by Americans,"" said David Lochbaum, director of the Nuclear Safety Project of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and former instructor for the NRC, claims the commission is playing what he calls ""regulatory roulette,"" sanctioning plant owners and demanding a clean-up in some cases, such as the Braidwood spill, but not in other instances, like Oyster Creek. ""The NRC can't have a 'Wheel of Misfortune' that decides when it acts and when it doesn't. The NRC needs to consistently enforce its regulations so that all Americans living in all states are protected,"" Lochbaum said. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken such criticism seriously. Last year it conducted a self-analysis to determine if it was responding adequately to nuclear plant leaks. The commission's Groundwater Task Force found that the ""NRC response to incidents could be enhanced to be more reliable."" ""It's fair to say that we're inconsistent in our response,"" concedes Martin Virgilio, deputy executive director for reactor and preparedness programs at the commission. ""That was one of the things that we took from that task force was that we needed to be more consistent in how we approach these problems."" In the case of Oyster Creek and other similar plant leaks, however, the NRC argues it did the right thing in not sanctioning the plant operators because the radioactive water remained on the property of the nuclear plant. ""None of the leaks have been significant. If you think about the radiological effects of these leaks, none have exceeded our regulatory requirements or have caused any problems from a health perspective to anybody located either onsite or offsite of the nuclear power plants,"" Virgilio said. New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection sharply disagrees. Not only is it concerned about tritium entering the underground aquifers, but analysis also shows a plume of tritium headed toward Oyster Creek surface water. So the state demanded Exelon clean up the contaminated groundwater. ""Once that water moved off the plant into the water supply of the state of New Jersey, we felt that it was in our responsibility to go after and protect that water supply,"" said New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Martin. ""We felt from New Jersey's point of view, our number-one job was to protect the health and safety of people in New Jersey."" Exelon cooperated. It drilled wells to pump out the contaminated groundwater. Subsequent measurements indicate tritium levels are steadily dropping as more groundwater is extracted. In a written statement, the plant owner told CNN, ""Exelon continues to meet with the state on a periodic basis to discuss progress of groundwater remediation for the plant, and we understand we have met expectations to date."" The groundwater is processed through the Oyster Creek plant's cooling system, where it is diluted. Then it pours into the Oyster Creek. So there are small concentrations of tritium in the creek where Alfonse Esposito fishes. But both state and federal regulators say those levels are far below what the Environmental Protection Agency would consider unsafe.","A leak of radioactive tritium from a nuclear plant in New Jersey drew no federal sanctions .

"(CNN) -- There is nothing new about the tension between the United States and Iran. Relations have swung from crisis to crisis ever since the fall of the Shah in 1979. But recently, this tension is turning into outright confrontation and the threat of war. In October 2011, an alleged Iranian plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States became public. A month later, the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report that showed Iran had experimented with virtually every element of nuclear weapons production and studied how to put nuclear weapons on its missiles. In December, the United States passed new sanctions designed to halt Iranian oil exports that nearly crippled Iran's ability to conduct international banking; the European Union passed similar sanctions this January. In response, Iran carried out a massive naval exercise in the Gulf and Indian Ocean. It issued threats to close the Gulf and even demanded that U.S. warships should not enter the Gulf. Iran announced it was dispersing the highly enriched uranium it had already produced at Natanz and putting more advanced centrifuges inside a deeply buried site in a mountain in Fordow. On January 30, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned that Iran might have a basic nuclear device within a year, although actual weapons would take more time to produce. Israel's top political leadership threatened Iran more directly than ever before, and Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, issued new calls for Israel's destruction. Iran is now far closer to making real nuclear weapons -- perhaps 2 to 3 years at most if it were to act decisively. Iran is also hiding its nuclear efforts and bringing new deeply sheltered facilities to full production. As a result, Israel may lose much of its capability to attack key targets in the course of this year, and some analysts put the deadline as early as this spring. The fear such an attack might come when the U.S. and European sanctions might still work is a key reason Panetta and President Barack Obama have expressed their concerns to Israel. The United States is quietly building up its forces in the Gulf, sending ballistic missile defense cruisers to the Mediterranean and a ""mother ship"" for special forces and mine sweeping to the Gulf. While it is making clear it prefer negotiations, the United States is also developing new weapons for its B-2 bombers that can strike at Iran's underground nuclear facilities. Last week Iran's Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, issued new threats to Israel. Israeli leaders again raised the prospect of preventive strikes on Iran. Secretary Panetta cautioned Israel against such action and President Obama offered Israel new security guarantees. The U.S. Senate debated even stronger sanctions. None of this has to end in war. Israel may be issuing veiled and not-so-veiled threats to push Iran towards negotiations. The United States may be publicly asking for Israeli restraint as much to get Iran's attention as out of fear that Israel might strike. Iran could pause its programs and receive benefits in terms of cheaper fuel for its nuclear reactor program, a mix of trade and investment incentives, and an end to sanctions. Last week, visits by United Nations officials to Iran may have failed, but future visits may succeed as Iran comes under greater pressure. Nothing about history offers any certainty about the future. Tensions and fears are rising in Israel and the Gulf. A misstated or misinterpreted threat, or some seemingly minor incident in Lebanon, Syria, or Iraq could trigger a process of escalation that could lead to serious conflict. Naval forces and capabilities for asymmetric warfare are steadily building on all sides. The clock is ticking on preventive Israel or U.S. military options as Iran gets closer to full nuclear capability. Unless Iran begins to negotiate with the West and halts its nuclear program, every passing month will raise the threshold of risk of some kind of serious clash in the Gulf. Israel may feel it ultimately cannot compromise. The risk of war will grow and can lead to threats or actions that raise oil prices even further. The United States is critically dependent on a healthy world economy that derives most of its oil from the Gulf. Put simply, at a time of economic uncertainty, how the confrontation between Iran and Israel plays out has as much effect on those in the Middle East as those in middle America. The impact of the new U.S. and European sanctions will not be fully felt in Iran until July. Until then, it's hard to say what will happen from today to tomorrow. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- The Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service is inspiring people across the country to volunteer this holiday weekend. But if you're itching to do more -- perhaps turning your next family vacation into a series of teachable moments about the importance of giving back -- there are plenty of opportunities to make that happen. More than Disney . A trip to Orlando can easily involve service. Just 20 minutes from Walt Disney World is a theme park called Give Kids the World Village. Its 70-acre grounds host 7,000 children with life-threatening illnesses every year. ""We partner with more than 250 wish-granting organizations around the world to help fulfill a child's one wish to visit the beloved theme parks of Central Florida,"" says Colette Krahenbuhl, a spokeswoman. ""If a child's wish is to swim with the dolphins, we are the destination. If a child's wish is to get a hug from Mickey Mouse, we help make that happen."" The resort relies heavily on volunteers. Since its founding in 1986, more than 50,000 volunteer ""angels"" have been put to work. Children as young as 12 can help out by scooping ice cream and serving meals, and children who love performing can even be part of the evening entertainment. The minimum commitment is one three-hour shift. Sweat-soaked volunteering . If your family wants a physically demanding volunteer vacation, the Sierra Club and local trails organizations offer unique, sweat-soaked opportunities. For as little as $400, a family of four can spend four to five days with the Adirondack Mountain Club -- meals, lodging (usually tents), transportation and equipment included. You'll be doing much-needed trail maintenance, and reconstruction projects and your kids will be taught outdoor survival skills. But hikers beware: ""While we know children have a lot of fun on these trips and they are exposed to an incredible experience, it can certainly be challenging,"" warns Wes Lampman, the club's director of north country operations. The club doesn't have age restrictions, but parents are urged to use their best judgment regarding their child's interest and physical ability. Trips are offered June through October. Chelsea Clinton: We can make a difference . Good works and decent lodging . The Sierra Club offers volunteer trips year-round at some of the country's top tourist destinations. At Arches National Park and Bryce Canyon in Utah, parents and children can assist in removing unwanted vegetation, while in Marin County, California, families can help protect endangered Coho salmon and Steelhead trout. All meals and equipment are included, but the fee for joining is significantly higher. Helping out next October along the New Jersey Seashore, especially meaningful after Hurricane Sandy's devastation, will cost $595 per person. But if you're looking to spend a week away from home -- doing good and staying in hotel-style lodging -- this trip may still be a bargain. Pauline Frommer, co-host of the nationally syndicated radio program ""The Travel Show"" and speaker at this year's New York Times Travel Show, says volunteer vacations offer children what they often don't get enough of in school. ""As volunteers, children can get down on the ground,"" says Frommer, who recommends Global Volunteers trips. ""They can get dirty. Unlike any other kind of travel, kids will get to better understand different people and their communities and their problems."" Hiking to help others . Trekking for Kids merges one-of-a-kind hiking expeditions to places such as Machu Picchu in Peru and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania with the ability to help orphans in those communities. ""Children are increasingly living a multicultural global existence,"" says Cindy Steuart, executive director of the nonprofit travel group. ""By being intimately involved in these service projects, they learn they can contribute to the greater good and make a difference. Our trips teach kids this lesson from the moment they sign up."" That's because Trekking for Kids doesn't let parents just write a check and have their kids show up. Each participant pays his or her own expenses and commits to raising $1,000. Children have raised money by holding bake sales, asking family and friends for donations and conducting tag sales. ""We think this increases a child's personal stake in the trip. Kids become more passionate,"" Steuart says. All money raised is poured into the orphanage the family will eventually visit, she says. As you plan your family's volunteer vacation, Frommer suggests keeping the following in mind: How long has the organization been in business? Do volunteers come back? Ask to speak with past volunteers; they are likely to be candid about their experiences. No matter which organization you partner with, Steuart says your child will likely learn an invaluable lesson. ""They'll understand the world is not just about them. It's about how others struggle to live and what we can do to help. I think that's the kind of world Martin Luther King wanted."" A life celebrated through service . Allison Gilbert writes about parenting for CNN Living. She is the author of ""Parentless Parents,"" ""Always Too Soon"" and ""Covering Catastrophe.""","Children with life-threatening illnesses can get their wishes at Orlando's most famous parks .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A contentious crowd of Tokyo Electric Power Company shareholders showed up Tuesday for their first meeting since the March tsunami to grill company executives about the future of the embattled company, as well as nuclear energy in Japan. But in the end, they rejected a motion for the company to abandon nuclear power, according to the Japanese news agency Kyodo, despite plenty of opposition. ""I am against the idea of the board of directors' decision to maintain the nuclear plants. I am here to see that the right decision is taken,"" said Kazuko Takahashi, as she waited in line to get into the meeting. ""The world is moving in that direction and I don't think TEPCO can resist that forever,"" she said, referring to anti-nuclear movements in nations like Germany. Germany's government formally approved a plan this month to close all the country's nuclear power plants by 2022. More than 9,000 people attended the TEPCO meeting, which lasted six hours. Both numbers were record highs, Kyodo said. Wrapped in a white Tyvek protective suit and mask, similar to the suits worn by members of the clean-up crews at Fukushima Daiichi power plant, Mamiko Nakanishi was urging a general vote in Japan. Protesters, including several activists from the environmental group Greenpeace, held up a banner that called TEPCO ""the worst ever polluting company."" They called out to the shareholders: ""You can change things, get TEPCO to dismantle their nuclear plants."" Many of the shareholders had never been to a board meeting before. But with TEPCO stocks in freefall -- they are worth about a tenth of their pre-tsunami value -- the shareholders wanted to have their say about plans for the company in which they had invested. More than three months after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, TEPCO is still struggling to control the crisis at Fukushima, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Three of the reactors experienced full meltdowns and continue to spew radiation. Recent efforts to decontaminate radioactive water that accumulated in the plant were halted because of continuing technical troubles.","Shareholders voice concerns for future of the company -- and nuclear energy .

"Washington (CNN) -- Even as it prepares to hand over the Libyan embassy in Washington to the rebel government, the State Department is warning the Transitional National Council to get its act together. An administration official told CNN the United States has warned the TNC that this is a ""do-or-die moment"" for the organization to carry out a credible and thorough investigation of the killing of its military commander, Abdel Fatah Younis. Last week's mysterious assassination has raised concerns that it might have been carried out by feuding groups within the rebels themselves. ""We do welcome the Transitional National Council's move to set up an impartial committee that will investigate the incident and we look forward to hearing the results,"" deputy spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Monday. ""It's important that, given the fluidness of the situation on the ground, that the Transitional National Council work to ensure that it takes the right kinds of actions, such as an investigation into the death, and sends a clear and transparent message that they speak on behalf of the Libyan opposition and the Libyan people and that they are diligently carrying out their mandate."" The TNC has been rocked by internal divisions, with rival rebel groups battling each other. The divisions create a dilemma for the Obama administration, which recognized the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya's rightful government on July 15 at an international meeting on Libya in Istanbul. The move, done in coordination with the international community, paves the way for the United States to reopen the embassy, accredit diplomats and unfreeze billions of dollars in frozen assets. The internal strife within the rebel movement comes as the State Department prepares to hand over the Libyan embassy to the TNC as the recognized government of Libya, according to U.S. officials. The officials say the move would allow the TNC to re-open the embassy, accredit diplomats and regain control of the embassy's frozen bank account, worth about $13 million. It follows a formal request from the TNC to re-open the embassy under its control and accredit Ali Aujali, the former Libyan ambassador to the United States, as its charge d'affaires. In March, the State Department ordered the Libyan embassy in Washington closed and kicked diplomats loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi out of the country.  Aujali had resigned his post as the regime's ambassador to the United States in February and has since represented the opposition in Washington. ""We are consulting with the National Transitional Council on a broad range of issues, and that includes diplomatic accreditation and representation,"" Toner said. Despite the divisions within the TNC, the State Department publicly expressed confidence in the rebels. ""We believe that this is the legitimate representatives of the Libyan people during this transition period,"" Toner said. ""This is an extremely challenging period for Libya and they are dealing with these challenges as they come. But we have confidence that they can weather this."" But privately, U.S. officials acknowledge there is some concern about the apparent disarray within the rebel movement, although officials say it is not surprising. ""This is a tribal society,"" one official said. ""We knew from the start this could be messy and there was always the concern about not moving too fast. We had no illusions about the TNC, but they have done a pretty good job and look better to us than Gadhafi at this point."" NATO has been bombing Libya for more than four months under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from troops loyal to Gadhafi, who is battling a rebellion that has claimed control of the eastern half of the country. The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was shuttered and American personnel evacuated by sea and air in late February, after the current revolt against Gadhafi erupted. Libyan and U.S. officials held face-to-face talks in Tunisia last month, but Washington says the sole point of the meeting was to repeat its demand that Gadhafi ""must go."" Also Sunday, state TV aired video of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, Gadhafi's son, speaking to what was described as displaced families. He has not been seen speaking in public for weeks. ""Whether NATO stays or not, the battle will continue until Libya is freed,"" he said, stressing the right of people to fight.  ""Let me say to you that the battle will not stop. Every one of you: return to your homes and farms and villages and jobs with peace of mind. We will not stop!""","NEW: Gadhafi's son: ""Whether NATO stays or not, the battle will continue until Libya is freed""

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The United Nations nuclear monitors plan to return to Iran at the end of the month after a positive assessment from both sides of the latest visit. An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team spent three days in Tehran this week. Another meeting is planned for February 21-22. ""The agency is committed to intensifying dialogue,"" said Director General Yukiya Amano. ""It remains essential to make progress on substantive issues."" The Iranian foreign minister called the talks ""a positive forward step."" Ali Akbar Salehi told the semiofficial Fars News Agency that the IAEA ""had some questions and we had very good meetings."" The team did not ask to inspect nuclear facilities, Salehi said. ""If they wanted an inspection, we were prepared to comply with their request,"" Salehi said. The six-member delegation -- including chief inspector Herman Nackaerts and second-in-command Rafael Grossi -- arrived in Tehran shortly after the European Union imposed new sanctions on Iran aimed at cutting off funding to the Islamic republic's nuclear program. Australia and the United States have also ramped up sanctions on Iran recently. Western powers believe Tehran is trying to develop nuclear weapons, an assertion Iran denies. Speaking Friday at the Davos Forum in Switzerland, Amano told reporters the visit was intended ""to clarify the issues with possible military dimensions. ""We are not very sure whether Iran has declared everything and, therefore, we are not very sure that everything stays in peaceful purpose,"" he said. ""In addition, we have information that Iran has engaged in activities related to the development of nuclear weapons. Therefore, we need to clarify."" Inspectors are in and out of the country regularly, an agency spokeswoman said Monday, but a high-level visit is more unusual. Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said he is ready to discuss the program with a group of nations -- Great Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- that have held intermittent talks with Tehran. The energy agency reported in November that it can no longer verify that the Iranian nuclear program remains peaceful, and Iran is under increasing international pressure to halt its nuclear fuel work. Salehi told Fars Wednesday that Tehran will soon send a letter to the six world powers to reiterate its readiness for talks. ""We hope that the meeting will be held in a not far future,"" he said.","NEW: International Atomic Energy Agency monitors will return in late February .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Workers at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have discovered a radioactive hot spot far more lethal than anything previously recorded at the damaged facility, the plant's owner reported Tuesday. The reading at the base of a ventilation tower between the No. 1 and No. 2 reactors Monday afternoon was 10,000 millisieverts per hour, the Tokyo Electric Power Company announced -- high enough that a 60-minute exposure could kill a man or woman within weeks. A U.S. expert told CNN that radioactive particles most likely concentrated in that area in the first days of the disaster, as plant operators tried to vent the damaged reactors. By comparison, the average resident of an industrialized country receives 3 millisieverts of background radiation per year, while the highest level reported in the days following the disaster was about 400 millisieverts. Tokyo Electric immediately cordoned off the area and is investigating both the cause of the high radiation and how it will affect the recovery work, company spokesman Naoki Tsunoda said. None of the workers who made the discovery have been injured, the company said. The Fukushima Daiichi plant, located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, was flooded by the tsunami that followed Japan's March 11 earthquake. The result was the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, as the plant's three operating reactors melted down and spewed vast quantities of radioactive particles across the surrounding area. The disaster has caused Japan to rethink its commitment to nuclear energy, and Germany has since announced plans to abandon atomic power entirely by 2022. Gary Was, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Michigan, said the location of the hot spot suggests the radioactive material was filtered from air and steam released to relieve pressure inside the reactors during the meltdowns. ""As they were venting, either intentionally or unintentionally, the building air was being sent through filters,"" Was said. Those filters may have been concentrating radioactive particles ""into one spot,"" he said. Was said the use of a gamma-ray camera could help identify whether the source of the radioactivity was reactor waste products, bits of nuclear fuel or both. Tokyo Electric mounted a gamma-ray camera on a three-meter (9.75-foot) pole to capture images of the hot spot Monday, the company said. Tokyo Electric says it expects to fully wind down the crisis at Fukushima Daiichi sometime between October and January. Engineers are struggling to manage an estimated 100,000 tons of highly contaminated water that was used to cool the reactors during the emergency, and Was said workers may face issues similar to the one discovered Monday as they try to decontaminate that fluid. ""Those filters are going to be screaming hot,"" he said. ""As bad as the water is, those filters are going to be worse."" CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: The hot spot may have resulted from reactor venting, a U.S. expert says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen on Friday declared ""we are at war"" following canceled production of the hit CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" and his impending loss of $1.2 million per episode. ""They know what they did is wrong,"" Sheen, who claimed he is clean, said in a call from the Bahamas to the ""Loose Cannons"" radio program. Producers cited Charlie Sheen's actions and statements when they announced they were calling off production for the rest of the season. ""Defeat is not an option,"" Sheen said in the Friday interview with ""Loose Cannons"" host Pat O'Brien. ""They picked a fight with the wrong guy. They are in absolute breach."" ""They kept telling me how to live my personal life,"" said Sheen, making repeated references to money he brought to the network. ""It was a toxic environment for eight years."" The actor, who began rehab treatments at his home in the wake of an emergency hospital visit in January, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" in text messages Friday he is going to show up for work anyway. Sheen appeared to challenge producers to take action Thursday when he went on a rant as a guest on ""The Alex Jones Radio Show."" ""I was told if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show and all that, so I'm just sort of seeing if they're telling the truth or not,"" Sheen told Jones. The decision to halt ""Two and a Half Men"" was announced Thursday after Sheen spoke with the Jones show. ""Based on the totality of Charlie Sheen's statements, conduct and condition, CBS and Warner Bros. Television have decided to discontinue production of 'Two and a Half Men' for the remainder of the season,"" the network and studio said in a joint statement Thursday. Warner Bros. Television is owned by Time Warner Inc., the parent company of CNN. CBS placed the sitcom on ""production hiatus"" after the actor began rehab treatments. The show had been scheduled to resume taping on four more episodes next week. It's not clear if ""Two and Half Men"" will return for a ninth season. Industry insiders estimate that the show has already grossed $400 million in reruns, putting total syndication fees for the 177 shows at a cool $1 billion. A Warner Brothers spokesman said that at least 250 members of the cast and crew will be out of work during the canceled production. Sheen said the employees should be focused, patient and to understand ""there are ways to deal with these clowns and take all their money."" Sheen said on the Jones show that he was dealing ""with fools and trolls"" and people with ""loser lives."" He also had some unkind words for Alcoholics Anonymous. ""This bootleg cult, arrogantly referred to as Alcoholics Anonymous, reports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math. ... Another one of their mottoes is 'Don't be special, be one of us.' Newsflash: I am special, and I will never be one of you! I have a disease? Bulls**t! I cured it with my brain, with my mind,"" Sheen told the show. The actor also went after show co-creator Chuck Lorre. A short time after the cancellation was announced, Sheen sent a statement to celebrity news website TMZ. ""I gracefully ignored this folly for 177 shows,"" Sheen wrote to TMZ. ""I fire back once and this contaminated little maggot can't handle my power and can't handle the truth."" Sheen's battle with producers is in sharp contrast to the kind words he had for them earlier this month when he thanked network executives for their support. ""I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people,"" Sheen said in a statement then. ""Like Errol Flynn, who had to put down his sword on occasion, I just want to say, 'Thank you.' "" Lorre had no comment Friday. Sheen's father, actor Martin Sheen, told Sky News earlier this week he likened Sheen's addiction to having cancer. ""If he had cancer how would we treat him?"" the elder Sheen asked. ""The disease of addiction is a form of cancer and you have to have a equal measure of concern and love and lift them up. That's what we do for him."" Addiction specialist Dr. Drew Pinsky told HLN on Friday that Charlie Sheen ""is clearly manic."" Pinsky said Sheen is exhibiting traits of advanced addiction, which he said has a grave prognosis without proper treatment. ""When their workplace is affected, that's when you know things are really bad,"" said Pinsky, whose new HLN show premieres April 4. Another Sheen radio interview last week raised concern about the actor's stability. Sheen, talking on ""The Dan Patrick Show,"" advised people to stay away from crack cocaine ""unless you can manage it socially."" He told Patrick then that he was ready to return to the show. ""I healed really quickly, but I also unravel really quickly, so get me right now guys,"" Sheen said. ""Get me right now."" Sheen was ""very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain"" on the morning of January 27, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor. Porn actress Kacey Jordan has told media outlets that a two-day party preceded Sheen's collapse. Paramedics went to Sheen's Los Angeles home and then took him by ambulance to a hospital, where he spent several hours. While his representative blamed a hernia for Sheen's pain, he later announced the actor was undergoing rehab at home. CNN's Alan Duke, Aaron Smith and Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Producers picked ""a fight with the wrong guy""

"Cairo (CNN) -- The trial of international aid workers -- including 16 Americans -- accused of fraud in Egypt got a brief start Sunday as intense behind-the-scenes diplomatic discussions simmered over the case. Out of the 43 defendants facing fraud charges, only 14 non-American workers showed up to court for a trial unfolding in the wake of the revolution that ousted former President Hosni Mubarak, and increasingly shaky relations with the United States. After charges were formally read, the judge adjourned the trial and scheduled it to resume April 26. The accused were detained as part of a crackdown on pro-democracy, non-government groups, which Egyptian officials say is part of a pattern of foreign interference that is stoking unrest. ""We are having intense talks at the highest levels of the Egyptian government because, obviously, we would like to see this resolved,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during an interview with CNN in Morocco. Clinton declined to discuss the details of the negotiations or whether the U.S. would surrender the Americans for trial. ""I don't want to go making this a dramatic situation,"" Clinton said. She also refused to discuss what the case could do to the 30-year relationship between the two countries. ""We have a problem. ... We have a problem with a lot of our friends around the world."" The accusations read out loud in court included the unlicensed formation of international organizations as well as illegally receiving and distributing funds from the United States. Authorities claim that millions of dollars in unlicensed funds were deposited directly from abroad into accounts in Egypt. The 14 defendants who appeared in court denied all charges. They sat in a caged section of the courtroom, which is customary in Egyptian courts, and were not in detention. They were released at the end of the hearing. Upon their exit, the courtroom audience broke into chants of ""down, down with military rule."" Yahia Ghanem, a local journalist, is a member of an accused NGO. He said the funding he did receive was required by Egyptian authorities to open an office and was much smaller than the amount he was accused of having. ""They said we received 22 million dollars,"" said Ghanem, who maintains that the sum was closer to $40,000. The list of charges continued with the unapproved conducting of political training and opinion polls -- and sending reports to the United States. The aid workers are charged with operating in Egypt without being officially registered and receiving foreign funding. Of the Americans charged, only seven are still in Egypt. Those in the country are all believed to be at the U.S. Embassy, though the Egyptian government has not asked for them to be turned over or to turn themselves in. Among the Americans charged in the case is Sam LaHood, director of Egypt operations for the International Republican Institute and the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Clinton has met repeatedly with Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohammed Amr in recent days in London and Tunis, and other senior administration officials are also involved, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Members of Congress say Egypt's action could mean the end of $1.3 billion in U.S. aid. In a letter to Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, 41 members urged the administration to withhold aid to Egypt until the country's leadership allows the offices of those organizations to reopen and returns seized property. Clinton's remarks came as an attorney for the Americans was in a packed Cairo courthouse asking for additional time ""to read evidence."" ""We have not read or even seen any of the case documents,"" attorney Sarwat Abdel Shadi said shortly before the hearing. An official with one of the U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations at the center of the case said none of the Americans has been served with papers to appear in court. ""None of the foreigners have been served documents to appear in court or received anything in writing. As far as I know, none of the foreigners are appearing in court today,"" said Les Campbell, regional director of the National Democratic Institute. Campbell, who has been in Cairo to follow the case, said there were 2,200 pages of evidence presented by the Egyptian government that have not been reviewed. In December, Egyptian authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 organizations, including the U.S.-based Freedom House, National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. They seized property and prevented some staff from leaving the country. It was not immediately clear what, if any, ramifications the Americans would face for not attending the hearing. Earlier, the Egyptian general prosecutor's office said a failure to appear could result in a maximum, mandatory sentence of five years and possible additional charges, a spokesman for the Egyptian general prosecutor's office said. Earlier this month, the United States was presented with a 24-page document from an Egyptian court laying out charges against U.S. and other international democracy-building groups. The State Department sent lawyers to Egypt to pore over the document. The United States has maintained that despite the charges, it does not consider the case truly a judicial one, but a matter between the two governments about the role of NGOs in Egypt. The two judges handling the cases have said the charges could lead to five-year prison sentences. CNN's Elise Labott and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Charges include illegal deposits of millions of dollars .

"Washington (CNN) -- Iraq is open for business, and American companies should make an effort to invest there, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. ""President Obama and I and our government believe strongly that expanding economic opportunity is as essential as building democratic institutions,"" Clinton said while surrounded by executives from companies as far-ranging as Occidental Petroleum, JP Morgan Chase, General Electric, Microsoft and Lockheed Martin, in a round-table discussion aimed at getting companies focused on commercial opportunities in Iraq despite its current ""tough environment."" The meeting comes as the United States transitions from a military-led to a civilian-led partnership with the Iraqi government by the end of the year. The State Department is leading an inter-agency effort to support American companies in their efforts to secure commercial opportunities in Iraq. With one of the largest customer bases in the Arab world, along with one of the best-educated work forces in the region, Clinton said, Iraq poses significant opportunities for American companies. The International Monetary Fund has projected for Iraq to grow faster than China over the next two years, she said. The United States, through its embassy and consulates throughout the country, stands ready to assist American companies ""to help create the conditions for investment and growth that will be broadly spread and create a ladder of economic opportunity for those willing to work hard,"" Clinton said. ""Iraqis are looking to rebuild every sector of their economy, not only their oil sector but agribusiness, transportation, housing, banking and many others."" With additional help from the Departments of Treasury, Energy and Agriculture, among others, the United States will actively support efforts of American businesses to set up operations to compete with Turkish, Chinese, French, Jordanian and Iranian companies already seeking business opportunities in Iraq. James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, is also working to establish an American Chamber of Commerce in Iraq to serve as an advocate for American businesses. Despite the opportunity Iraq offers, Clinton said, she would ""not sugarcoat"" the difficulties posed by the current working environment in Iraq. ""There are still significant security challenges, bottlenecks in infrastructure, unclear regulations and, unfortunately, corruption. But as our Iraqi colleagues will tell you, they are working hard to make it easier to do business in Iraq for Iraqis and foreign investors alike."" Clinton said the United States would also make it a priority to support the integration of women into the Iraqi work force. ""I know that a lot of the best students in Iraqi universities happen to be women, and I hope that Iraq takes full advantage of half the population, ready to work, ready to roll up their sleeves to assist in the transformation of their country,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- A motorcade carrying Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Philippines was pelted with eggs and other objects Wednesday, the State Department confirmed, but the car carrying Clinton was not hit and there were no injuries. The incident occurred at 2:45 p.m. in Manila, when the motorcade was traveling from the presidential palace to another location, deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters in Washington . ""The secretary's motorcade ran into a crowd of approximately 40 to 50 people, protesters,"" Toner said. ""They threw objects at the lead vehicle -- I believe it was eggs and paintballs, they maybe threw rock -- and the motorcade pulled out of that area and went to the next scheduled meeting place."" Toner later clarified that the ""paintball"" was more likely a balloon filled with paint. He also said that at no time was Clinton in danger. Clinton is in the Philippines for commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. As part of that treaty, she signed the Manila Declaration binding the countries to work together on a variety of mutual interests.","A motorcade carrying the secretary of state is pelted by eggs and more .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she had a frank discussion with the Pakistani president on Friday as part of a push to repair the relationship with Islamabad in the wake of a U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accompanied Clinton for what one senior State Department official said beforehand would be a ""sober"" set of talks about the need for Pakistan to root out terrorists in its country. The meeting between Clinton and President Asif Ali Zardari was behind closed doors, but afterward Clinton described it as ""very extensive, open, frank and constructive."" Describing the countries as friends with shared interests, Clinton said the United States and Pakistan must intensify the fight against terrorists who have used Pakistan as a safe haven. She also commented on a question raised after bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos. ""I want to underscore a point that I made in public in the last weeks and made again privately today to the president, the prime minister and others,"" the secretary said in a joint statement with Mullen. ""There is absolutely no evidence that anyone at the highest levels of the Pakistani government knew that (bin Laden) was living just miles from where we are today."" The revelation that bin Laden was living in plain sight for years amongst Pakistani military installations, and Pakistan's humiliation at the U.S. decision to undertake the raid without telling them, has thrown the relationship into one of its worst points in history. ""Now is not the time for retreat or for recrimination,"" Mullen told reporters. ""Now is the time for action and closer coordination; for more cooperation, not less; for the friendship to get stronger, not weaker."" Clinton said Pakistan has a responsibility to prevent insurgents from waging war in Afghanistan from its territory. She also extended an olive branch, saying the United States will stand by the Pakistani people ""for the long haul."" Both Clinton and Mullen noted that Pakistani blood has been shed in terror attacks. Clinton asked Mullen to come with her so they could have one meeting where they are delivering the same message at the same time and gauging Pakistani's reaction together, a senior administration official said. After the meetings, Zardari's office issued a statement saying, the two sides agreed to ""work together in any future actions against high value targets in Pakistan"" and to cooperate in promoting peace in Afghanistan. A senior Obama administration official told reporters after the meeting that it provided an opportunity for the leaders to smooth the relationship. ""I think we walked back from the brink from a week or two, I think this continued the process and I don't think she would have come if they hadn't already taken some of those initial steps. I think this is simply defining and putting that on firmer and firmer grounding,"" the official said. That official and a second senior administration official hinted that joint U.S.-Pakistani operations may be conducted soon. Acording to a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation Poll, about 80% of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Pakistan and about 25% consider the country to be an enemy of the United States. Last summer, 78% of Americans surveyed had an unfavorable view of the country. The poll surveyed 1,007 Americans by telephone May 24 through May 26 and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Clinton had been expected to visit Pakistan earlier this month for more fulsome talks, as part of a ""strategic dialogue"" that covers more than a dozen areas of cooperation between Washington and Islamabad. But she postponed her visit after the raid on bin Laden's compound by U.S. Navy SEALs. ""The fact of the matter is that the international community has been able to kill more terrorists on Pakistani soil than any place else in the world. We could not have done that without Pakistani cooperation,"" Clinton told reporters in Paris earlier this week. ""I believe strongly it is in our national security interests to have a comprehensive, long-term partnership with the government and people of Pakistan."" Last week, Marc Grossman, special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, traveled to Islamabad, where he delivered the set of demands, emphasizing the United States needed actions, not words from Pakistan, according to a senior official briefed on the talks. The official was not authorized to speak on the record. During several meetings with Zardari, and others, Grossman said the United States was looking for more cooperation from Pakistan in fighting extremism. The meetings were described by a senior official briefed on the talks as ""tough, but fruitful."" The talks followed a visit a few days earlier by Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who delivered a similarly tough message . During the meetings with Grossman, the senior U.S. official said, a Pakistani official voiced strong concern about the continuation of U.S. drone strikes against targets inside Pakistan, but he and other members of the Pakistani leadership expressed a willingness to press al Qaeda, conduct joint operations and support reconciliation. Officials point to enough progress since Grossman's visit, including the fact Pakistan returned the tail of a helicopter that was left behind after the raid, for Clinton to make the trip to Pakistan. But they say the relationship between the two countries needs serious repair before cooperation on areas important to Pakistan can continue. Two weeks ago, the Pakistanis asked the United States to reduce the number of military trainers in Pakistan. A Pentagon spokesman said this week the U.S. has begun to comply and is removing some of the more than 200 personnel who are posted there.","NEW: Clinton, Mullen say U.S., Pakistan must continue working together .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Tuesday ditched ""quiet diplomacy"" and spoke publicly in support of Saudi Arabian women protesting the unwritten ban on their right to drive in the kingdom. ""What these women are doing is brave and what they are seeking is right"" said Clinton, in answer to a question from CNN at a press availability at the State Department. ""This is about Saudi women themselves, they have joined together. They are acting on behalf of their own rights."" Until now, the State Department said Clinton was engaged in ""quiet diplomacy,"" working behind the scenes and raising the issue last week in a telephone conversation with Saudi Prince Saud al-Faisal. On Monday, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters, ""There are times when it makes sense to do so publicly and there are times for quiet diplomacy."" But Saudi Women for Driving, which describes itself as a coalition of women's rights activist, bloggers and academics campaigning for the right to drive, told the secretary of state they were ""disappointed"" by her public silence. Clinton has made women's rights a top issue for American diplomacy. ""Quiet diplomacy is not what we need right now,"" the group said in a letter. ""What we need is for you, personally, to make a strong, simple and public statement supporting our right to drive."" The movement was sparked by the May 22 arrest of a Saudi technology consultant and mother named Manal al-Sharif who was detained for driving her own car. Supporters started a campaign on the Web and collected, they say, 100,000 signatures from 156 countries calling for al-Sharif to be released and acquitted of all charges. On Friday, some Saudi women turned the key in the ignition and set out on a motorized protest. Clinton's public silence had raised questions that she might be sidestepping the controversy to avoid angering the Saudi government at a time when the United States needs help on Mideast issues. The United States has avoided criticizing Saudi Arabia amidst the Arab Spring uprisings in other Mideast and North African nations. On Tuesday, however, Clinton shot that down, saying, ""This is about Saudi women themselves, they have joined together, they are acting on behalf of their own rights."" ""This is not about the United States, it's not about what any of us on the outside say, it is about the women themselves and their right to raise their concerns with their own government."" ""We have made clear our views that women everywhere, including women in the kingdom, have the right to make decisions about their lives and their futures,"" Clinton said. ""They have the right to contribute to society and provide for their children and their families."" The right to drive, she said, provides access to economic opportunity, including jobs.","Saudi women are protesting restrictions that prevent them from driving .

"(CNN) -- As Inauguration Day approaches, the question on everyone's lips is: What will the first lady be wearing? Glitz, gowns and government bigwigs will all be on display at Monday's parade of inaugural pomp and circumstance. President Barack Obama will be ceremonially sworn into his second term in office by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts around midday. After the daytime events, which will include the inaugural address and parade, the president and first lady Michelle Obama will end their night by taking to the dance floor at two inaugural balls. While the formal events bring out their fair share of celebrities, media mavens, and the just-darn-lucky citizens who scored tickets online, there will be only one belle of the ball: The first lady. Lessons in style from Michelle Obama . Behold one of the most prized traditions of the inaugural season: the wait for the dress. The hype around the inaugural ball gown is the closest thing this side of the pond to a royal wedding gown, and it's approached with the same gusto. ""There has always been an interest in what the first lady is wearing. Photographs and descriptions of the inaugural gown and who designed it have been news for decades,"" said Lisa Kathleen Graddy, the curator of The Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection at the National Museum of American History. ""Sometimes sketches and descriptions of the dress and even formal photographs of the incoming first lady wearing the dress were released in advance to newspapers,"" she said. After all, it is typically the country's collective first impression of the first lady. Mr. President, who are you wearing? Monday evening, the president and first lady will attend the Commander in Chief's Ball, which honors service members and their families, a tradition started by former President George W. Bush; and at the Inaugural Ball, the president and first lady will celebrate with people around the country who bought tickets to attend. At the 2009 inaugural balls, Michelle Obama donned a white chiffon, one-shoulder dress created by Jason Wu, a then up-and-coming, 26-year-old Taiwanese-born designer. She didn't reveal who or what she would be wearing until she stepped out that night. Wu's name is now mentioned in the same breath as heavy-hitting designers like Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Hererra, Marc Jacobs and Diane Von Furstenberg. That now-iconic gown is part of ""A First Lady's Debut,"" a collection on display at The Smithsonian. Included in the display are the gowns worn by the 11 most recent first ladies, beginning with Mamie Eisenhower. The museum also houses The First Ladies Collection, which displays clothing worn by earlier White House residents. ""When we look at the gown that Jackie Kennedy wore 50 years ago, or the one that Mary Todd Lincoln wore more than a hundred years before that, it really takes us beyond the history books and the photographs, and it helps us understand that history is really made by real live people,"" said the current first lady at the unveiling of her gown in March 2010. She continued: ""The detail of each gown -- the fabric, the cut, the color -- tells us something much more about each single first lady. It's a visual reminder that we each come from such different backgrounds, from different generations, and from different walks of life."" Graddy said Mamie Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan in particular captured the look and feel of their eras -- the early '50s, '60s and '80s, respectively. Mamie Eisenhower's iconic inaugural ball gown was designed by Jewish-American fashion designer Nettie Rosenstein, who championed ready-to-wear fashion and is credited by many with popularizing the ""little black dress."" It was a sparkling pink creation, made with 2,000 rhinestones. ""First Lady Pink"" soon became a popular color choice for ladies of the decade. While Eisenhower was quintessential 1950s, Jacqueline Kennedy went signature '60s with a gown by Ethel Frankau of Bergdorf Custom Salon. Frankau, who based the gown on descriptions and consultations with Mrs. Kennedy, created a slim, straight silhouette. A chiffon overlay covered an encrusted, off-white strapless bodice (wearing strapless couture without some sort of covering was considered risquÃ© at the time). Meanwhile, Nancy Reagan's hand-beaded gown by American couturier James Galanos cost $22,500 and oozed the Hollywood glamour that she and her actor-turned-politician husband brought to the White House. It's a given that no matter how handsome President Obama might look in his tuxedo at the galas, all eyes will be on his companion. ""The first lady is both an American celebrity and one of the most visible representatives of the nation. She's 'our' first lady and our pride and interest, and curiosity, extends to what she wears,"" Graddy said. See the past 100 years' worth of inaugural outfits in the gallery above.

"(CNN) -- Phil Mickelson fought off a nasty virus and his co-overnight leader Nick Watney to land the WGC-CA Championship on the Blue Monster Course at Doral. Mickelson holds the winning trophy aloft after a last-day battle in Florida. It was the second title of the year for Mickelson, who had been treated for heat exhaustion and dehydration before carding a last day 69 for a 19-under total of 269. Watney finished a shot back, coming up a fraction short with a birdie putt on the tough 18th which would have forced a playoff. World No.1 Tiger Woods produced his second 68 of the weekend to finish tied for ninth on 11-under in the first strokeplay event of his comeback. Jim Furyk provided the last-day challenge to the leaders with a closing 67 for 16- under, with India's Jeev Milkha Singh fourth at 14-under and England's Oliver Wilson tied fifth with Colombia's Camilo Villegas after a brilliant closing 66. Miickelson was claiming his first World Golf Championship victory, coming hard on the heels on his win at the Northern Trust Open in Los Angeles. ""I fought hard all day and wasn't really able to pay attention to some of the great shots that Nick hit because I was so worried about keeping my energy level high and steady throughout the round,"" Mickelson told the Press Association. ""I haven't eaten much in three days and I fought hard. I knew I was playing some of my best golf coming in here and I was playing well so I'm very excited to have finished it off."" The lead had changed hands three times between Mickelson and Watney over the front nine with Watney holing in a chip at the ninth from 80 feet to stay in the hunt. A bogey on the 11th saw Watney trail again and after both men bogeyed the 12th it was left for Mickelson to hold his nerve in the closing holes. Both men hit fine shots to the closing par-four hole, with Watney's putt coming up agonizingly short. ""I can't believe I left it short,"" he said. ""Unfortunately I just didn't hit it hard enough. ""I'm pleased with the way I played. Right now it still hurts to finish second -- disappointing to come up one shot short. But overall it was a positive week, and I've just got to keep working hard."" Northern Ireland teenager Rory McIlroy slipped off the pace in the final round with a one-over 73, but still achieved his second consecutive top-20 finish in his debut on the PGA Tour. He was bracketed at nine-under with, among others, Luke Donald (72), Ernie Els (70), Padraig Harrington (71) and Justin Rose (68).","Phil Mickelson claims $1.4 million first prize at the WGC-CA Championship .

"(CNN) -- In return for food aid from the United States, North Korea has agreed to stop nuclear activity at its main facility in Yongbyon, both countries said Wednesday. North Korea has also agreed to a moratorium on long-range missile launches. ""Today's announcement represents a modest first step in the right direction,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. ""We, of course, will be watching closely and judging North Korea's new leaders by their actions."" Wednesday's news might be the most encouraging since 2008, when six-party talks last broke down over North Korea's nuclear program. Since then, there has been tension and uncertainty, including a nuclear test in 2009 and the death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il in 2011. How did we get to this point? Here's a refresher course on North Korea's nuclear program: . 1993: First accusations . The International Atomic Energy Agency accuses North Korea of violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, an agreement that has been signed by most of the world's countries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The IAEA demands that inspectors are given access to two nuclear waste storage sites. North Korea threatens to quit the NPT, which it ratified in 1985. But it ultimately agrees to inspections. 1994: First agreement . North Korea and the U.S. sign an agreement for North Korea to stop and eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons program. In return, North Korea will get aid to build two power-producing nuclear reactors. 1998: Provocation . North Korea fires a rocket that flies over Japan and lands in the Pacific Ocean, proving it has the ability to strike its neighbor. Later in the year, North Korea and the U.S. start holding talks over the suspected construction of an underground nuclear facility. The U.S. demands inspections. 1999: U.S. eases sanctions . North Korea allows U.S. inspections in return for help on its potato yields. Inspectors find no evidence of nuclear activity during its visit. Later in the year, President Bill Clinton agrees to ease economic sanctions against the country. A U.S.-led international consortium also agrees to sign a $4.6 billion contract to build two nuclear reactors in North Korea. 2001: North Korea threats . Unhappy with the progress on its promised power plants, North Korea threatens to restart its nuclear weapons program. It says it will start testing missiles again unless normalized relations are resumed with the U.S. 2002: 'Axis of evil' In his State of the Union address, President George W. Bush says North Korea, Iran and Iraq are an ""axis of evil"" seeking weapons of mass destruction. Later in the year, the Bush administration says North Korea has admitted having a secret program that violates the NPT. 2003: North Korea says it's a nuclear power . North Korea withdraws from the NPT, reactivates its nuclear power facilities and begins test-firing missiles. On April 23, it declares that it has nuclear weapons. 2004: Six-party talks begin . Negotiations begin at a summit of six nations: North Korea, South Korea, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia. North Korea offers to freeze its program in exchange for aid, eased sanctions and removal from the U.S. list of terrorist sponsors. The U.S. wants North Korea to disclose all of its nuclear activities and allow inspections. These six-party talks would be off and on for the next two years with no long-term agreement. 2006: First nuclear test . North Korea claims to have successfully tested a nuclear weapon at an underground facility in Hwaderi. Days later, the test would be confirmed by the outside world. Responding to the test, the U.N. Security Council approves a resolution to impose sanctions against North Korea and require an end to nuclear and ballistic missile tests. 2007: Progress? North Korea agrees to close its main reactor for $400 million in aid. A couple of months later, the U.S. releases about $25 million of frozen North Korea funds from a bank in Macao. North Korea also agrees to disable its nuclear program by the end of year. Days later, South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun becomes the first South Korean to walk across the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas. He meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il for a three-day summit. 2008: Talks break down again . North Korea misses its deadline to disable by the end of 2007, although the destruction of a water-cooling tower in June 2008 shows promise. In October, the U.S. announces that North Korea is taken off the list of states that sponsor terrorism. But when six-party talks resume in December, North Korea refuses to allow unfettered access to inspectors at suspected nuclear sites. 2009: Second nuclear test . North Korea announces that it has begun reprocessing spent fuel rods. One month later, it announces its second nuclear test, and the U.S. Geological Survey confirms a seismic disturbance at the same underground site used for the first test in 2006. North Korea reports that the reprocessing of 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods has given it enough weapons-grade plutonium for one to two nuclear bombs. 2011: U.S., North Korea meet . U.S. officials meet with a North Korean delegation to talk about resuming the six-party talks that ended in 2008. Late in the year, the two countries meet again to discuss possible food assistance in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear activity. Kim Jong Il passes away two days later, to be replaced by son Kim Jong Un. 2012: Moratorium announced . The U.S. and North Korea both report that an agreement has been reached to halt nuclear activity.","North Korea has reached an agreement to curb its nuclear program .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A Lebanese militant wanted by the United States in connection with the killing of five American soldiers in Iraq was released because of lack of evidence, Iraq's prime minister said Saturday. Nuri al-Maliki's comments came on the heels of growing outrage among U.S. officials over the release Friday of Ali Mussa Daqduq despite last-minute requests by the White House that he be turned over to stand trial in the United States. In a written statement, al-Maliki said he could not agree to turn over Daqduq to the United States because the ""Iraqi judiciary did not agree"" the request was in accordance with Iraq's laws. With the release of Daqduq, at least one U.S. lawmaker has called for U.S. relations with Iraq to be re-evaluated. ""This is an outrage. Families of those who were killed by this terrorist should also be outraged, and appropriate action should be taken in regards to our relations with the Iraqi government,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told reporters Friday. Daqduq is accused of participating in the January 2007 kidnapping and killing of the five American soldiers in the Iraqi holy city of Karbala. After he was captured in Basra in March 2007, according to U.S. intelligence officials, Daqduq pretended to be a deaf-mute. But officials identified him as a 24-year veteran of Hezbollah who admitted to working with the Quds Force, a branch of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. U.S. military intelligence contended the Quds Force was using Hezbollah as a surrogate in Iraq. Daqduq was held by the U.S. military as an ""enemy combatant."" He was the last detainee to be turned over by the United States before a December 2011 deadline to withdraw. In May, an Iraqi court cleared Daqduq in connection with the killings. In the statement released Saturday, the prime minister said the Iraqi court ordered Daqduq's release after it determined there was a lack of evidence. The United States appealed the ruling and provided additional evidence against Daqduq, which the Iraqi court also ruled was insufficient, al-Maliki said. Daqduq left Iraq shortly after his release for Lebanon, his lawyer said. ""There is no legal reason for his detention. He should have been released months ago,"" his attorney, Abdulalmehdi al-Mutairi, told CNN. The case was widely seen as a test of U.S.-Iraqi relations despite the growing political influence of Iran over Iraq. U.S. officials were reluctant to hand over Daqduq to the Iraqi judiciary over fears that under pressure from Iran, Iraqi authorities would release him. The U.S. State Department vehemently objected to Daqduq's release and vowed to continue to try to bring him to justice. ""Let me add that as with other terrorists who we believe have committed crimes against Americans, we are going to continue to pursue all legal means to see that Daqduq sees justice for the crimes of which he is accused,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Friday . The State Department has been in contact with the Lebanese government, according to Nuland, and will continue to pursue all ""legal means"" to bring Daqduq to justice. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported from Baghdad; CNN's Chelsea J. Carter reported from Atlanta. CNN's Jennifer Rizzo in Washington contributed to this report.","Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki cites lack of evidence in the release of Ali Daqduq .

"(CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration on Tuesday unveiled a ""trusted traveler"" program -- one meant to expedite screening at U.S. airport checkpoints, agency chief John Pistole said. ""As with any initiative, we are testing this prescreening concept with a small passenger population at limited airports,"" he said at an aviation security conference in the Netherlands. ""If proven successful, we will explore expanding the program to additional travelers, airports and airlines."" All participants must be U.S. citizens who voluntarily release certain information about themselves. During its evaluation phase, TSA PreCheck will be available only to certain frequent fliers on American and Delta airlines flying out of certain airports. Delta passengers must be flying out of Atlanta and Detroit airports, and American Airlines passengers must be flying out of Miami and Dallas airports. It was opened to participants in Custom and Border Protection's Trusted Traveler programs, including Global Entry, SENTRI, and NEXUS. ""As TSA moves further away from a one-size-fits-all approach, our ultimate goal is provide the most effective security in the most efficient way possible,"" said Christopher McLaughlin, TSA assistant administrator of security operations. The program won't guarantee expedited security screening, according to Pistole, who said participants would still be subject to ""random and unpredictable security measures."" In July, the TSA said it would expand this pilot program to include United, Southwest, JetBlue, US Airways, Alaska and Hawaiian airlines, and additional airports, once operationally ready. Currently, the TSA vets passenger lists against ""watch lists"" of known or suspected terrorists. But the TSA is working with a very limited amount of information about those passengers -- namely a person's full name, date of birth and gender. Under trusted traveler programs, travelers voluntarily surrender more information about themselves, giving the government more assurances of who they are. The amount and nature of the information that will be sought were not disclosed. There have long been calls for the TSA to adopt a trusted traveler program. Congress and critics have stepped up that demand following two highly publicized incidents, one involving the search of a 6-year-old girl, and the other involving a 95-year-old cancer patient. In both cases, the TSA has said the airport screeners were following established protocols. But the TSA also has said it is working toward a ""risk-based"" trusted traveler program that could expedite travel for people believed to present little risk to aviation. The TSA said in July that Pistole will work with Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Alan Bersin and the airlines to determine passenger eligibility for this screening project, which is voluntary. All passengers in the pilot project will be subject to recurrent security checks. Security experts have long expressed concern about so-called clean skins -- potential terrorists who enroll in trusted traveler programs to avoid scrutiny during a terror mission. But the TSA says it will continue to incorporate random and unpredictable security measures to address such concerns. Pistole said in July that other layers of security will remain in place, including intelligence gathering and analysis, explosive-detection canine teams, federal air marshals, closed-circuit television monitoring and behavior detection officers. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: TSA officials say the program is meant to balance security with efficiency .

"(CNN) -- When Piers Morgan asked Barbra Streisand who her favorite actor of all time was, the legendary actress and singer opened up about a unique road trip she took with the late Marlon Brando in the 1970s. In an interview on Friday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" the actress, singer and director talked to the CNN host about Brando, her long career, the Democratic Party, her new movie ""The Guilt Trip"" and more. ""(Brando) wanted to take me to the desert, to see the wildflowers,"" said Streisand. She said he wanted to ""sleep over in a ghost town,"" but Streisand refused his advances. ""I was such a nice Jewish girl that I just said, 'Marlon, I can't stay overnight with you. I'll go with you for the day',"" recalled Streisand. ""Marlon clearly wanted to do more than just look at flowers with you,"" Morgan pointed out. Streisand said that while she did turn the legendary actor down, the pair remained friends and often talked on the phone ""for hours and hours."" Streisand: I've never been in love with a Republican . Fans of Streisand may be surprised to learn she considers herself to be an actress who sings and not the other way around. ""I only began to sing because I couldn't get a job as an actress,"" Streisand said. In ""The Guilt Trip,"" Streisand plays Joyce, who Morgan calls ""the archetype of Jewish mama."" Joyce is a single mom whose inventor son, Andy (Seth Rogen) invites her on a cross-country road trip to try to sell his product. Streisand's career has spanned more than a half-century and netted Grammys, multiplatinum albums, Emmys and Oscars for acting, directing and, of course, singing. ""You must have the cabinet room that's the size of the New York Yankees,"" Morgan said. ""I mean, does any of that really motivate you? Do you ever look at it and think, yes, I've not done badly for a young girl from Brooklyn?"" Streisand, 70, said losing her father at such a tender age -- she was only 15 months old -- fuels her urge to be remembered. ""I want to have made marks here,"" she said, ""and records and films, television shows, they do that. They say you existed, you were here."" Nevertheless, Streisand doesn't like performing in front of people, which she said she realizes is odd. ""I never know what to do during the applause,"" she said. ""I don't know what to do."" In fact, Streisand did not perform live for 27 years after a 1967 concert in New York's Central Park where she forgot the lyrics to some songs in front of a crowd of more than 130,000. Why Streisand signed up for 'Guilt Trip' Morgan told Streisand that ""The Way We Were"" remains his ""single favorite movie of all time,"" and that he once even broached the subject of a sequel with Robert Redford. Alas, movie fans hoping for an on-screen reunion of Katie (Streisand) and Hubbell (Redford) will be disappointed to learn that a sequel is just not meant to be -- not unlike Katie and Hubbell. ""I talked to Robert Redford about it,"" Morgan said, ""and he said he had been resisting your clarion call for a sequel ever since."" ""It's such a good story; these people,"" said Streisand, who noted that while she understands Redford's urge to avoid sequels, ""this happens to be a great story."" Streisand told Morgan she had hoped to release a sequel on the film's 21st anniversary. Her idea for the film would have centered on Katie and Hubbell's daughter Rachel's political activism at UC Berkeley and the Democratic National Convention in 1968. ""Why have you been so consistent in support of Obama?"" Morgan asked Streisand, a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party. ""I can't even imagine thinking about what would happen to the Supreme Court if a Republican were the president,"" said Streisand. When Morgan asked Streisand if she had ever been in love with a Republican, she said ""never,"" and that it wasn't likely to happen ""unless there was an enormous sexual chemistry"" and the would-be couple never discussed politics. Streisand noted that for her, President Obama's proudest moments have been his support of gay rights and his stance for women.

"(CNN) -- The Algerian foreign minister on Thursday shot down assertions that Moammar Gadhafi is in his country, saying that was never an option. ""Of course not,"" Mourad Medelci told French radio network Europe 1 when asked whether Gadhafi was in Algeria. ""The hypothesis that Mr. Gadhafi could come knocking on our door was never considered."" Medelci also offered more insight on Gadhafi's family fleeing to Algeria. ""I think the information that was disclosed which concerns some of his family members who had to be received in Algeria because of extreme circumstances, mainly humanitarian reasons, created a wave of panic,"" Medelci said. Gadhafi's wife, two sons and other relatives fled to Algeria, deepening the mistrust between the rebel government and Libya's powerful neighbor. Algeria described the move as a humanitarian gesture, but it angered the National Transitional Council, with one official calling it ""an aggressive act."" The transitional council has accused Algeria of supporting the Gadhafi regime. Algerians also complained to the United Nations about damage done to their embassy soon after the rebels entered Tripoli. Algeria will in the future recognize the National Transitional Council as the government in Libya, he said during the radio interview.

"Editor's note: CNN agreed to change the names of the two men in this article to protect their identities. Rami and Kamal, both gay Iraqis, say they rarely show affection for men in public. BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Kamal was just 16 when gunmen snatched him off the streets of Baghdad, stuffed him in the trunk of a car and whisked him away to a house. But the real terror was about to begin. The men realized he was gay, Kamal said, when he took his shirt off and they saw that his chest was shaved. ""They told me to take off my clothes to rape me or they would kill me immediately. This moment was the worst moment in my life,"" he said, weeping as he spoke of the 2005 ordeal. ""I was watching them taking off their clothes, preparing to rape me. I did not know what to do, so I started shouting loudly, 'Please do not do that! I will ask my family to give you whatever you want.' ""  Watch the tormented life of gays in Iraq » . His pleas went unheeded. ""The other two kidnappers took off my clothes by force, and, at that time, I saw them as three dirty animals trying to tear my body apart."" He was held for 15 days, released only after his family paid a $1,500 ransom. He was raped every day. Only once, he said, was he allowed to talk to his family during captivity. ""I told my family that I was beaten by them, but I did not dare to tell my family that I was raped by them. I could not say it, it's too much shame."" CNN spoke with Kamal, now 18, and his 21-year-old friend Rami about what it's like to be gay in Iraq. Coming out as gay is not easy in any country, but to do so in Iraq could mean a death sentence or torture. The two men rarely show feelings toward each other in public. They spend a lot of time in Internet cafes in Baghdad, surfing gay chat rooms and seeking contacts with other gay men in Iraq and elsewhere. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the situation for gays and lesbians in Iraq has deteriorated. Ridiculed under Hussein, many now find themselves the targets of violence, according to humanitarian officials. Lesbians are also victims of harassment and violence, but not nearly as often as gay men. It's unknown how many homosexuals have been killed by militias in the lawless streets of Iraq's cities, but some Web sites post pictures of Iraqis they say were killed for being gay. One photo on the Iraqi Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender site shows a group of men standing around three male bodies sprawled on a street, blood pouring from their heads. ""Gay Iraqi victims of the police and death squads,"" the site says. A U.N. report on human rights in Iraq reinforces the accusations of violence. Although gays are supposed to be protected by law in Iraq, it says, they face extreme brutality. ""Armed Islamic groups and militias have been known to be particularly hostile toward homosexuals, frequently and openly engaging in violent campaigns against them,"" the report said, adding that homosexuals have been murdered. ""Militias are reportedly threatening families of men believed to be homosexual, stating that they will begin killing family members unless the men are handed over or killed by the family,"" it said. The report was issued at the end of 2006 and is the last U.N. study to touch on the subject. Human rights experts say homosexuals are targeted for cultural reasons as well. ""Gay men and lesbians in Iraq face a lot of risks right now, because homosexuality is sometimes interpreted by people in Iraq as being a Western import,"" said Scott Portman with the Heartland Alliance, a group that promotes human rights worldwide. ""So they can sometimes be targeted by insurgent groups or militias, in part, because of animosity toward the West and, in part, because homosexuality is not well-accepted in Iraqi society."" He added, ""the biggest threats right now are from militia organizations, who will attack and actually sometimes kill gay men and women."" Kamal and Rami say the dangers are all too real in Baghdad -- and they live in secrecy not to shame their families. ""I would rather commit suicide than allow my family to find out I am gay,"" Rami said. Kamal said he often pretends to have girlfriends in social settings and tells his friends he's dating girls. ""I am also careful with the way I dress -- not to show them that I am gay, especially my family."" What would his family do if they found out? ""They will force me to give it up, and I cannot do that,"" he said. ""The 'normal' people cannot live in Iraq. Imagine how the life is for gays."" Rami added, ""I do not know why people hate gays even though so many have this tendency. But still they hate it."" Homosexuality is a touchy subject for many Iraqis. When CNN asked Iraqis in Baghdad how they felt about homosexuals, we found intolerance to be widespread. One man said he considers gays no different from ""criminals and terrorists."" Another claimed that homosexuality was ""illegal under Islamic law, and [gays] should be punished by law like criminals."" Rami said he once fell in love with a man who was part of the Mehdi Army, a Shiite insurgent group loyal to the radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Their relationship eventually soured. ""One day he told me he would come over to my house and kill me in front of my family,"" Rami said. ""I told him I would come outside and be killed in the street because I do not want my family to find out I am gay."" Both men hope to escape Iraq. They say their ideal destination would be San Francisco, California. For now, both of them keep their feelings secret. Kamal is still tormented by what happened to him nearly three years ago. ""During my sleep, I only see nightmares, and I start crying. My family thought it was because they were beating me."" He paused. ""Only my close friend Rami knows about this secret.""","Gay Iraqi describes being raped for 15 days by gunmen at 16 .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least five people were injured when bodyguards for a top Iraqi official opened fire on stone-throwing Sunni demonstrators Sunday, the country's interior ministry said. The clashes broke out after Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq arrived to address crowds protesting in a plaza in the western Iraqi city of Ramadi. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have been there for nearly a week, demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni residents. Some demonstrators Sunday called for al-Multaq, who is Sunni, to submit his resignation to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government. Protesters chanted, ""Leave! Leave!"" and threw stones at him, witnesses told CNN. The deputy prime minister's bodyguards opened fire in an attempt to disperse the crowd as protesters hurled stones at the stage, Anbar provincial council member Suhaib al-Rawi told CNN. A protester with a gunshot wound was among five people injured, al-Rawi said. Details about the other injuries were not immediately clear. Sunnis largely boycotted Iraq's 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected, which contributed to years of bloody insurgency and sectarian warfare. The arrest of a group of bodyguards for Iraq's Sunni finance minister fueled a surge in protests last week in Ramadi, about 110 km (70 miles) west of Baghdad, and in several other Iraqi cities. On Friday, protesters carrying flags dating back to the Saddam Hussein regime took to the streets in the predominately Sunni Anbar province, blocking a vital highway that connects Iraq with Syria and Jordan. The demonstrations were called by tribal leaders and Sunni scholars, protesting against what they decried as unjust practices of Maliki's government. Protesters demanded the release of detainees they said were held without charges. They called the government corrupt and accused it of unfairly targeting Iraq's Sunni community. ""We don't want your food, your water and your medicine,"" one scholar told the crowd. ""We want our rights, our dignity."" In the wake of the protests, al-Maliki has defended his government. ""Nobody in Iraq has privilege over others,"" he said Friday, calling for increased dialogue. ""When we want to express an opinion, we have to do it in a civilized, humane and patriotic manner,"" he said. ""It is not expected to express your opinion by cutting off roads, steering strife and sectarianism, fighting, bragging about wars and dividing Iraq.""

"(CNN) -- Where would Tiger Woods be without his agent? The golfer's crown as one of the world's wealthiest and most successful sportsmen may have slipped somewhat, but he knows who helped get him there in the first place. When Mark Steinberg departed from IMG last month after his contract expired, Woods decided to stick with the man he has worked with since 1998 rather than stay with the company that has done more than most to boost golfers' incomes. The move underlined the importance that such ""super agents"" have in the modern game of golf. The focus of the game may always be the battle fought on fairways and greens, but the side of the sport that is away from public gaze is of increasing importance. Whether it's navigating the pitfalls of fame, cutting lucrative behind-the-scenes deals with sponsors, managing media appearances or just providing support to an athlete on a long, grueling Tour -- agents are crucial to the life of a top golfer. If you watch this week's U.S. Open, you will no doubt notice Andrew ""Chubby"" Chandler. With his mahogany tan, broad grin and even broader waistline, the 58-year-old cuts quite a dash on the golf course. Tiger leaves IMG, stays loyal to agent . At Augusta in April, it was Chandler who bear-hugged Charl Schwartzel as the South African celebrated Masters victory. And Chandler who defended Rory McIlroy after the young Northern Irishman's challenge imploded on that final day. Chandler's company, International Sports Management (ISM), represents two of golf's four reigning major champions, and has four players inside the world's top 20. Not much happens in the sport without him knowing about it first. ""There's no question Chubby's a massive influence in golf right now,"" Golf World magazine editor Chris Jones said. ""He could bring down a tournament if his biggest players decided not to play in it. Potentially, that's a dangerous amount of power to hold."" The rise of ISM has coincided with a global power shift in golf. Five years ago, three of the four major champions were American, and all three were members of the PGA Tour. Today the U.S. is empty-handed. The four majors are held by two South Africans, in Schwartzel and British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen, a German in Martin Kaymer (U.S. PGA Championship), and an Irishman in Graeme McDowell (U.S. Open). The PGA Tour still have three major holders as members -- in McDowell, Schwartzel and Oosthuizen -- but with Kaymer, along with Chandler stars McIlroy and England's World No. 1 Lee Westwood, opting to concentrate on the European Tour instead, the PGA Tour lost out on the memberships of two the top three players in the rankings, and three of the top 10. New breed of super agents . The power base has shifted across the Atlantic. And from a management perspective, the traditionally all-powerful IMG agency has been forced to concede some influence. McDowell is managed by Connor Ridge of Horizon Management in Ireland, while Kaymer is with Johan Elliot of Swedish-based Sportyard AB. IMG, meanwhile, is without a major winner but it does represent England's Luke Donald -- the latest world No. 1 in succession to Westwood and Kaymer following the fall of Woods. No wonder Chandler was smiling when we met at London's exclusive Jumeirah Hotel -- dressed in a slick gray suit and open shirt after yet another day of wall-to-wall meetings. ""You think we're powerful, do you ... I was hoping nobody noticed that,"" Chandler said. ""We've certainly got influence, but I don't think we use it unfairly. I don't think it's an unhealthy situation."" Snubbing the ""fifth major"" Not everybody would agree. When McIlroy and Westwood announced they would skip the PGA Tour's flagship event, The Players Championship in Florida, Chandler and his players were widely criticized. ""Moving it to the middle of May has made it about the 10th most important tournament in the world,"" Chandler said. ""It isn't a priority for them as they would rather win a major or a World Golf Championship event."" If this was Chandler against the PGA Tour, then he wasn't pulling his punches. He wanted the best for his players, and the best meant pulling two of his biggest draws from one of the highest-profile tournaments in the world. Even if it wasn't intentional, it was a quite a power play. Chubby the fixer . Chandler's evolution to a super agent began in his 15 years as a journeyman professional golfer, where he earned a reputation as a man who sourced cheap flights and did things on a budget. It turned out he was a far better fixer than he was a golfer, and when he retired in 1989, aged just 36, he set up a management agency to make the most of his talents. ""My big break was when I got a call from Darren Clarke to meet him over in Ireland in 1990,"" Chandler said. ""We shook hands on a deal and when I saw him play for the first time I thought, 'Wow, this guy can really play, we've got a proper business now.' "" Word spread quickly, and a week later Chandler got a phone call from Westwood's father, who wanted to show him a video of his son's swing. A cup of tea later, Westwood joined ISM, and the foundations were in place for his empire. Chubby's empire . Two decades on and ISM now looks after the interests of 48 golfers, 20 cricketers, 41 footballers and a Paralympic gold medallist. It employs around 30 people and has offices in the UK, India, South Africa and Florida -- plus a new base recently acquired in Manhattan, New York. Chandler's profile has reached such a level that he regularly gets autograph requests at tournaments -- much to the amusement of the likes of Westwood and Clarke. And much as ISM is a lot more than the one-man show it began life as in 1989, it's hard to imagine its existence without the showman and ringleader who heads up the operation. ""I am what I am. I'm straight shooter and I'm blessed with a fair amount of common sense -- which stands me in good stead,"" Chandler said. And there speaks arguably the biggest player in golf today.","Andrew ""Chubby"" Chandler is a former professional golfer who set up agency ISM .

"Washington (CNN) -- Pulitzer Prize-winning presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin notes each inauguration is moving in its own way, but only a few produce moments that are truly memorable. ""It depends upon the person and the occasion to really produce a historic inaugural speech,"" Goodwin said. ""But the ceremony itself ... is a real tribute to the country, that a person who was the president can go out and become a private citizen (while) a new private citizen is becoming the president."" ""It's peaceful,"" she says, and ""that's an extraordinary thing in the history of our world."" Here are 10 inaugural moments that Goodwin says have stood the test of time: . 2009: Obama makes history . There was a magic to the inaugural day for President Barack Obama. ... (It was) as if the whole history of our country was coming full circle -- the ending of slavery and now the first African-American president. So the crowds were reveling in that spirit -- 1.8 million (people), more than had ever been there before. The great reset: Will Obama's second inauguration let America turn the page? Just the idea that we had come this far as a nation. There was a sense of unity and a sense of pride, I think, in our country that this was finally happening. 1981: Reagan's optimistic first inaugural speech . What was so impressive about Ronald Reagan's inaugural speech, I think, was the optimism that it suggested after a period when America was feeling like we might have been in decline. Even though he had the exact opposite message as Franklin Roosevelt, where he was talking about government as the problem rather than the solution, both Reagan and FDR shared that American sense that we can do things. Inauguration viewer's guide . In a certain sense, the optimism of the speech was symbolized by (Reagan's) transferring the inaugural to the West Front of the Capitol, which made a much grander spectacle. More people could watch it, so it was a big occasion. 1977: Carter's long walk . Jimmy Carter made the decision evidently just three weeks before the inauguration that he would walk after his inauguration back to the White House. And it really was an extraordinary moment. ... There was a feeling with Carter that he was being a people's president, as opposed to the imperial guard that had surrounded Nixon. And so he's walking, (and first daughter) Amy is running around next to him. There's a sense of exuberance, and a sense that something special is happening. Why Sunday? Obama's dual inauguration ceremonies honor tradition and law . 1961: JFK's stirring address . What is so memorable about John F. Kennedy saying that the torch is being passed to a new generation is that he himself represented a new generation. (He was) 22 years younger than Dwight Eisenhower, and what the speech promised was action, movement, (and) a new energy coming into the government and into the country. When we think of those famous words -- ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for the country"" -- it was followed up by thousands of people wanting to join the Peace Corps, and the Civil Rights movement was already out there. There was a sense of working on poverty, so the words projected action, and that's what makes them memorable. iReport: I hope Obama will... What always strikes me about JFK's inaugural (address), however, is that he said in the course of it ... that all this would not be accomplished in 1,000 days, meaning the programs that he had outlined. Originally in the draft of it, he had said all of this would not be accomplished in 100 days, but he slashed it out because he did not want to be compared to FDR's 100 days. But little would he ever imagine that 1,000 days would mark the end of his life, and that that would be his presidency. 1945: FDR's abbreviated wartime ceremony . Roosevelt decided in 1945, when the war was still ongoing, to dispense with the traditional parade. Who is there to parade, he said, and so he made it a very simple ceremony (at the White House). Atlanta pastor, Evers' widow named to speak at inauguration . He himself was suffering from heart failure at that time, so it was a five-minute speech and he needed to fortify himself with whiskey in order to get through the pain that he was feeling. So sadly, the physical state of FDR matched the mood at that time. 1933: FDR's dramatic first inaugural speech . We all remember the phrase ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,"" but even more important than the phrase was the attitude that FDR had. He projected optimism, he projected forward movement, and people felt -- that's the mystery of leadership -- that somehow the (Great) Depression they were suffering (through), they weren't going to be in it alone anymore. ... They had a leader who was going to take care of it. Hoover, however, was very upset during the transition about what FDR did not do. He was hoping some action would be taking place while he was still president, but FDR wanted to wait (and) have a clean slate while he was president. ... Hoover was very angry about that, and there was lots of tension between the two. 1905: TR's eclectic parade . What's interesting about Theodore Roosevelt's inaugural parade is that it symbolized the many-sided character that TR was. So there you have Harvard alums marching side by side with Indians, marching side by side with cowboys, with Rough Riders. ... And Chief Geronimo was there. There was a sense in which TR had so many interests. There were different sides of him, and the parade symbolized that. It just seemed like this incredibly eclectic parade. Ryan: 'my obligation' to attend the inauguration . 1865: Lincoln strives to unite North and South . What's so extraordinary about Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural is that here the North is finally on the eve of winning this long Civil War, but no triumphal message does he deliver. ... He talks about the fact that the sin of slavery was shared by both sides. Both sides read the same Bible. Both prayed to same God. Of course the words we remember -- with malice toward none and charity for all. Lincoln knew that inaugural spoke words that would be remembered. He wasn't as sure about some of his other speeches, but he knew that. A-listers sign up for inaugural celebrations . When he went into the party after the inaugural, the one person who he wanted to know and get his approval from was Frederick Douglas, the abolitionist. And Douglas came over to him and said, 'Mr. President, it's a sacred effort.' 1841: The tragedy of William Henry Harrison . It's so sad that what we remember William Henry Harrison for is not (his) military service before the presidency, but the fact that he gave the longest inaugural (speech) and had the shortest presidency. He insisted on not wearing a coat (during the ceremony). It was freezing out, he developed pneumonia, and he died. That is the memory of William Henry Harrison. I'm sure it's not the way he would hope to be remembered. They finally learned from Harrison's inaugural. ... When it was freezing weather during Ronald Reagan's (second) inaugural they moved it inside and canceled the parade. It's one of the dangers of having these inaugurations in January or even in March in the old days. 1789: Washington sets the tone . The thing that's so interesting (about) Washington's inaugural is that it set so many precedents. Even in that week before his inaugural, they were debating what to call him. Some people like John Adams wanted the president to be called his Mightiness or his Highness. Thomas Jefferson said, 'No, it must simply be ""Mr. President."" ' Adams said, 'That's nothing. He could be president of a garden club. It won't be dignified for the world at large.' But of course (Washington) becomes Mr. President. Everything was setting a pattern. It was an extraordinary moment. Share your inauguration photos on iReport .","2009: ""(It was) as if the whole history of our country was coming full circle""

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- There's nothing better than a sweet, juicy watermelon on a hot summer's day, right? But what if you had to pay six grand for it? A marine products dealer in Japan plunked down a record $6,125 (¥650,000) Friday for a black Densuke watermelon -- grown only on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. Premium melons regularly go for eye-popping amounts there. Only three years ago, someone shelled out about $3,000 for one. The one that sold Friday had dark green skin -- nearly black -- making it look more like a bowling ball than a fruit. The nearly 18-pound (8 kg) watermelon was one of 68 sold as part of the season's initial harvest this year and is one of only a few thousand available each year. As for the buyer, he said he wanted to support local agriculture, according to an official with a local cooperative.","Black Densuke watermelon in Japan sells for a record $6,125 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The wife of a Colorado father at the center of the ""balloon boy"" saga told authorities that the giant helium balloon was specifically created for a hoax to draw media attention, according to court documents released Friday. Mayumi Heene told Larimer County investigators that she and her husband, Richard Heene, knew that their 6-year-old son, Falcon, was hiding at their Fort Collins home the entire time, even as police and military scrambled to search for the boy, according to the documents. The admission by Mayumi Heene was made October 17, just two days after the balloon was released, according to the documents. The Heenes initially told authorities that they believed their child had flown away on the balloon, and when the balloon landed without him, they expressed concern that he may have fallen out of the device. The couple hatched the plan about two weeks before the incident and ""instructed their three children to lie to authorities as well as the media regarding this hoax,"" according to the documents. Their motive? To ""make the Heene family more marketable for future media interests."" Calls to David Lane, Richard Heene's attorney, and Lee Christian, Mayumi Heene's attorney, were not immediately returned Friday. Richard and Mayumi Heene are each facing a number of local charges, including conspiracy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and attempting to influence a public servant, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said Sunday. Lane has said that the sheriff was overreaching and that the family deserve the presumption of innocence. The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating the incident. Richard and Mayumi Heene met in a Hollywood acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality TV, Alderden has said. The Heenes have appeared on the ABC program ""Wife Swap.""

"(Health.com)  -- Each year, nearly 10,000 high school athletes in the U.S. suffer heat-related illnesses that require medical attention and cause them to miss practice or games, according to a report released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fully two-thirds of those cases occur in August, according to the report, and roughly 80 percent of the stricken athletes are football players, who at this time of year are often slogging through grueling preseason workouts. With temperatures hovering in the 90s and beyond, dehydration and heat exhaustion while exercising are a very real -- and potentially dangerous -- threat. And competitive athletes aren't the only ones who can experience problems when the mercury and humidity peak. Even if they're in excellent shape, weekend warriors may find themselves suffering heat-related symptoms after a long run or even a day of lawn mowing and yard work. Health.com: 10 easy ways to burn calories this summer . ""People get out there and...do a really hard workout,"" says Scott Anderson, a certified athletic trainer in Clearwater, Florida. ""The sensible thing is to go slow, and work up progressively. ...A lot of people even go indoors and cross-train if it's too hot."" Not everyone has access to a climate-controlled gym, however. If your only option is to exercise outdoors despite the torrid weather, you can take some steps to avoid problems such as dehydration, cramping, heat exhaustion, and -- because air quality gets worse on hot, muggy days -- breathing trouble. How heat and humidity take a toll . When your body gets overheated, its natural response is to sweat. And when that sweat evaporates off your skin, it lowers your body temperature. But if the temperature or humidity is sky-high, this built-in cooling system can break down. Sweat doesn't evaporate properly because of all the moisture in the air, and your skin doesn't release body heat as effectively. ""You're still sweating, but it's not doing as much for your body temperature,"" says Michael F. Bergeron, Ph.D., director of the National Institute for Athletic Health & Performance at the Sanford University of South Dakota Medical Center, in Sioux Falls. As your body temperature climbs, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and muscle cramps can result. All of these are signs of heat exhaustion. And if you don't cool off quickly -- by going into an air-conditioned building or drinking cold water, say -- heat exhaustion can sometimes turn into heat stroke. Health.com: 15 big benefits of water . Heat stroke occurs when your body temperature hits 105 degrees. The condition can cause problems in the muscles, kidneys, liver, brain, and heart, and people with heat stroke often start to breathe quickly and behave erratically, Bergeron notes. If they don't get medical help and bring their body temperature down, they may even have a seizure or slip into a coma. In extreme cases heat stroke can be deadly. If you or someone you're with start to experience the symptoms of heat stroke, seek medical attention immediately or call 911. When is it safe to exercise outdoors? It's important to watch the temperature, but the most relevant number you need to know before heading outdoors is the heat index, which takes humidity into account and represents how hot it feels. The risk of muscle cramping and heat exhaustion rises as the heat index climbs above 90. Although less serious than heat exhaustion, cramping is dangerous, especially when you're dehydrated. ""When you start cramping and don't have enough fuel in the tank, that can lead to something more serious, like pulling a muscle,"" Anderson says. When the index is higher than 100, heat stroke also becomes more likely. In the Tampa Bay area, where Anderson conditions and trains high school football players, the index is almost always in the danger zone, and it's not uncommon for it to reach 105. It's really important to modify your exercise routine when the index is that high, Anderson says. Health.com: Fun in the sun workout . Anderson recommends scaling back the duration or intensity of your workouts once the hot weather hits. It takes about two weeks to get acclimated to exercising in the heat (especially if you're not in top shape to begin with), he says. After that period, you're free to gradually ramp back up. When it's really hot out, Bergeron advises, it's a good idea to take breaks more frequently, exercise in the shade whenever possible, and wear breathable and light-colored clothing. Exercising in the heat is safe if you use common sense and follow some basic rules, Bergeron says. ""As long as they're not working [out] too hard, someone who is well rested, hydrated, and nourished can tolerate pretty tough conditions,"" he says. Stay hydrated . The most important thing to do while working out in the heat is to stay hydrated. That may seem obvious, but hydrating properly is more complicated than you may think. For starters, you should drink plenty of fluids before and after your workout, not just during. Anderson tells his football players to hydrate throughout the day to prepare for their 4 p.m. practices, and to drink 16 to 20 ounces of water or a sports drink (like Gatorade) one hour before practice. Health.com: Drink this for a better run . During your workout, you should consume 4 to 16 ounces of fluids every 15 to 20 minutes, according to the American College of Sports Medicine. Sports drinks -- which contain lots of sugar and additives in addition to the electrolytes that help keep you hydrated -- are most beneficial during prolonged exercise, Bergeron says, and it's sometimes wise to alternate them with water. Don't rely on your thirst to tell you when to drink. ""People let thirst drive them to drink, but it isn't enough to match what they are losing [by sweating],"" Bergeron says, adding that if you start feeling thirsty, you're already dehydrated. Food is also important for staying hydrated. Eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day -- especially foods such as bananas that contain potassium and other vital nutrients (in addition to water) -- will help prep your body for a workout in the heat. ""Maintaining good hydration is key to safety in the heat, but it is not all protective,"" Bergeron says. Research that Bergeron took part in has shown that even if kids are well hydrated, they can overheat and even experience heat stroke if they exercise too intensely and get hot too quickly. ""You can still overheat and have serious problems when you are well hydrated,"" he explains. Protect your lungs . Dehydration and heat exhaustion aren't the only hazards of exercising on hot days. The stagnant air caused by heat and humidity tends to trap airborne pollutants, such as car exhaust, which react in the presence of sunlight to form ozone, a main ingredient in smog. Working out in smoggy air can cause lung trouble in people with respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). But even in people without lung conditions, hard exercise on days with lots of smog can reduce lung function and create a reaction akin to an asthma attack, says Norman Edelman, M.D., chief medical officer of the American Lung Association. Health.com: 7 surprising triggers of lung trouble . ""Ground-level ozone is an irritant. If you breathe in too much, it irritates the nose, throat, and lungs,"" Edelman says.

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- Wei Wenhua was a model communist and is now a bloggers' hero -- a ""citizen journalist"" turned martyr. The construction company manager was driving his car when he witnessed an ugly scene: a team of about 50 city inspectors beating villagers who tried to block trucks from unloading trash near their homes. Wei took out his cell phone and began taking pictures. The city inspectors saw Wei and then attacked him in a beating that lasted five minutes. By the time it was over, the 41-year-old Wei was slumped unconscious. He was rushed to the hospital but was dead on arrival. His death earlier this month continues to stir controversy. In China's mainstream media and in the blogosphere, angry Chinese are demanding action. After the Web site sina.com published news of Wei's beating, readers promptly expressed their outrage. In one day alone, more than 8,000 posted comments. Bloggers inside and outside China bluntly condemned the brutal killing.  Watch the swirling controversy over Wei's death » . ""City inspectors are worse than the mafia,"" wrote one Chinese blogger. ""They are violent civil servants acting in the name of law enforcement."" Another blogger asked, ""Just who gave these city inspectors such absurd powers?"" Known as ""chengguan"" in Chinese, city inspectors are auxiliary support for police. They are expected to deal with petty crimes. Their tasks include cracking down on unlicensed trading. They frequently are seen chasing street vendors off the streets and confiscating their goods. Critics have said they often abuse their authority and prey on the weak. In the central city of Zhengzhou last year, 1,000 college students scuffled with police and overturned cars after city inspectors roughed up a female student who had set up a street stall. These incidents prompted the government to redefine the role of city inspectors. Still, observed Jeremy Goldkorn, editor in chief of Danwei.org, ""Some bloggers [are] saying this whole chengguan system is prone to corruption and abuse and it should be disbanded."" Beijing scholar Xiong Peiyun wrote in Wednesday's Southern Metropolis Daily, ""Perhaps no one wishes to face this question. Wei Wenhua's death stands as clear proof of the violent ways of local city inspectors. It's 2008 and another citizen goes down. When will we stand up and restrain the law enforcement violence of this city inspectors system?"" More and more victims of abuse already are standing up. ""It's the latest in a series of incidents which have pit provincial government authorities against citizens -- those who are protesting against something who are recording and blogging and writing about something that they consider scandalous,"" Goldkorn said. Some journalists and bloggers have even compared Wei's fatal beating to the Rodney King case, when the Los Angeles police repeatedly clubbed him. Others say this is reminiscent of the 2003 death of graphic designer Sun Zhigang in the Chinese city of in Guangzhou. The 27-year-old college graduate was fatally beaten while in detention for not carrying proper identification. The public outcry, amplified in the country's blogosphere, prompted China's premier to restrict police powers of detention. Years ago, killings such as these would not have received such attention, and victims would have been forgotten, but with modern technology in the hands of ordinary citizens, abusive officials are getting caught in the act. China's burgeoning economy allows a relatively freer flow of information. In September, China had 172 million Internet users, 10 million more than the last official count was released in July. Officials said about 4 million Chinese go online for the first time every month. Millions have opened blogs, too. Mobile phone users also reached more than half a billion in September, according to the government. Even though Article 35 of the Chinese Constitution is supposed to guarantee freedom of speech, China continues to restrict the flow of information. Fearful of the surge in Internet and mobile phone usage -- and the information they are able to transmit -- the Chinese authorities are stepping up efforts to monitor and restrict their use, according to Reporters Without Borders, which fights against censorship and laws that undermine press freedom. A few Internet data centers have been closed down, along with thousands of Web sites. Controversial blogs are blocked and unblocked multiple times. But silencing these citizen journalists is getting more difficult. Days after Wei's January 7 death, a government official in Tianmen city, Wei's hometown, was fired, four others detained and more than 100 placed under investigation. Chinese authorities now appear to be taking these cases seriously. Goldkorn said: ""It's the kind of trouble that is very threatening to the party and the government, because it's the kind of trouble that questions their reason d'etre. So when looking at things like this, in the back of their minds, is always, 'Could this develop into a real mass incident that has the power to threaten the stability of China?' "" Meanwhile, bloggers are heaping eulogies for Wei. So far, no one has seen the pictures Wei took that day. It is thought his camera was destroyed in the beating. ""Eternal repose to Citizen Wei Wenhua,"" wrote blogger Wang Gongquan. ""In the face of violence and brute power, he lifted a citizen's rights, conscience, responsibility and courage."" Reporters Without Borders said, ""Wei is the first 'citizen journalist' to die in China because of what he was trying to film.""

"(CNN) -- Few people like Monday mornings and for world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, his latest in Melbourne very nearly signalled the end of his quest to win a third consecutive Australian Open title. The Serbian survived an epic fourth round encounter with Stanislas Wawrinka that stretched beyond 1.30am local time, eventually wrapping up a monumental 1-6 7-5 6-4 6-7 12-10 victory. Djokovic ripped his shirt off to celebrate a triumph that had looked in serious doubt for nearly five exhausting hours, while his Swiss opponent departed from the court on the verge of tears. It keeps alive the 25-year-old's hopes of becoming the first man in the Open era post 1968 to record a successive hat-trick of titles in Melbourne, in a match that had echoes of his 2012 final win over Rafael Nadal. ""It's hard to find the words,"" a drained Djokovic said in an on court interview. ""He deserved, equally, to be a winner of this match. I give him a lot of credit and respect. ""He was the aggressive player on the court, I was just trying to hang in there. It's midway through the tournament but it feels like a final to me. This means a lot to me, and to him. ""Incredible that so many people stayed until nearly two in the morning. It brings back the memories of 12 months ago with Rafa."" Wawrinka gave notice of his intent by wrapping up the first set 6-1 in just 25 minutes before normal order was resumed as Djokovic regained his composure to push into a 2-1 lead. But Wawrinka battled hard and ensured a deciding set when he took his third set point as the fourth went into a tiebreak. After swapping breaks early in the fifth set, both men repeatedly retained their serve as the epic match pushed into the early hours of Monday morning. Djokovic held to move into an 11-10 lead and then carved out two match points in the 22nd game of the decider. Wawrinka saved two but it proved third time lucky for Djokovic as his passing shot ended the match in front of an exhilarated crowd. Djokovic will now face Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinal after the Czech fifth seed coolly disposed of South African Kevin Anderson 6-3 6-2 7-6. Elsewhere, Spain's fourth seed David Ferrer cruised past Japan's No. 17 seed Kei Nishikori with a 6-1 6-2 6-4 win to set up a clash with fellow countryman Nicolas Almagro. He progressed after opponent Janko Tipsarevic retired in the second set. In the women's draw, second seed Maria Sharapova relinquished just one game as she raced to an emphatic 6-1 6-0 victory over unseeded Belgian Kirsten Flipkens. The Russian has dropped just five games in her four matches in Melbourne -- an Australian Open record -- and says she is loving her tennis at the start of the 2013 season. ""I love competing,"" she told the Australian Open's official website. ""There's nothing in the world that gives you that adrenalin feel, just being in the moment of a match. There's nothing that I've done in my life that has given me that experience. ""It takes a lot to get to that moment, a feeling, whether it's pressure or nerves, excitement, it's a combination of those things, but that feeling, and getting through it and winning, beating your opponent, as an athlete."" Sharapova wrapped up the second set in just 25 minutes to set up an all-Russian quarterfinal against Ekaterina Makarova, the No. 19 seed, who knocked out fifth seed Angelique Kerber 7-5 6-4. Kerber, from Germany, suffered with a back injury during the match helping Makarova to reach the last eight for the second time in succession in Melbourne. Fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, from Poland, defeated 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic, from Serbia, 6-2 6-4. She will now face China's Li Na in the last eight after the 2011 French Open champion beat German 18th seed Julia Goerges 7-6 6-1.","Defending champion Novak Djokovic survives five-set epic to defeat Stanislas Wawrinka .

"Chicago (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's re-election campaign said Tuesday it is returning about $200,000 in donations collected by two Chicago men after a newspaper report described their brother as a fugitive with alleged links to violence and corruption in Mexico. ""More than 1.3 million Americans have donated to the campaign and we constantly review those contributions for any issues,"" Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said. ""On the basis of the questions that have been raised, we will return the contributions from these individuals and from any other donors they brought to the campaign."" The announcement came after The New York Times published a report detailing alleged ties between the two campaign donors and a Mexican casino magnate. Carlos Rojas Cardona and Alberto Rojas Cardona began raising money for the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee in Chicago last fall, according to the newspaper. Various members of their family gave a total of $200,000 due to the efforts of the men, an Obama campaign official told CNN. The two Chicago-based brothers maintain connections with a third brother, Juan Jose ""Pepe"" Rojas Cardona, a Mexican casino magnate who pleaded guilty to U.S. federal drug charges in 1994 and later jumped bail in Iowa, the New York Times said, citing public records and news reports. A 2009 U.S. State Department cable obtained by WikiLeaks alleges that Pepe Rojas had ties with violence and organized crime. Citing an anonymous source, the cable also alleges that Pepe Rojas and another brother had donated millions of dollars to political campaigns in northern Mexico, in addition to providing one candidate with a helicopter and free advertising. ""Obviously we didn't know who these folks were, and they themselves were not the guilty party, and the vet didn't go deep enough, obviously,"" David Axelrod, a senior strategist for Obama's re-election campaign, said on MSNBC Tuesday morning. ""When we found out about these entanglements, we returned all the money that they donated and raised, and we'll continue to do that."" That was the right move, according to Manny Sanchez, a Chicago attorney and staunch Obama supporter. ""If it appears like it might be questionable, the smartest thing is to return the money and just back off,"" said Sanchez, who first met Carlos and Alberto Rojas at a fundraiser organized by influential Latino Democrats in Chicago last December. ""The appearance doesn't look good, but I can tell you this: nothing nefarious was involved in any of the exposures I had to either of the brothers. ... The brother in Mexico, the name never came up nor did any activity with respect to this brother ever come up,"" he said. They might not have anything to do with their brother's alleged activities in Mexico, he said. ""I step back a second and say, just because someone's got a sibling with some issues doesn't necessarily impact or reflect poorly on the siblings that are here,"" he said. Carlos, Alberto and Pepe Rojas could not be immediately reached for comment. Accounts in the Mexican magazine Proceso describe Pepe Rojas as a ""casino czar"" with numerous holdings in the industrial city of Monterrey. The magazine said he had donated millions of dollars to candidates at the state and federal level, suggesting some donations paved the way for obtaining casino licenses. Pepe Rojas pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in 1994 after authorities accused him of transporting marijuana in New Mexico. A judge granted prosecutors' request to dismiss the indictment and close the case in 1998. He was convicted of felony theft and forgery charges in Iowa state court two decades ago, and there is still a warrant for his arrest there stemming from a judge's decision to revoke his probation after his 1994 federal drug arrest, Johnson County Attorney Janet Lyness said. In 1991, authorities say, he forged and cashed hundreds of dollars worth of employee paychecks while working as the vice president of a telemarketing company, Lyness said. When an attorney requested that Iowa's governor pardon Pepe Rojas for the state charges last year, Lyness replied that he did not deserve a pardon. ""He hurt a lot of very innocent people in his actions,"" she said Tuesday. ""He has yet to take responsibility."" CNN's Kevin Bohn, Gustavo Valdes, Rafael Romo, Rene Hernandez, Krupskaia Alis and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: An attorney says he saw ""nothing nefarious"" about the fundraising brothers .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- If there's one thing that would have struck a chord with seven million Hong Kongers this election season, it was U.S. President Barack Obama and his challenger Mitt Romney using China as a political punching bag during the recent televised debates. America blames China for many of its economic woes, while Hong Kong has a more complex relationship with the mainland, one that is rooted in historical, cultural and political differences. Beijing has long been accused by Washington of keeping its currency artificially low, giving Chinese exporters an advantage over their competitors. Last month, Romney accused China of manipulating its currency ""for years and years,"" while taking American jobs. He even repeated his vow to declare Beijing a currency manipulator on his first day in office. China rejects this. A recent report from the state-run Xinhua agency warned that this mud-slinging, if converted into policy, would trigger a trade war ""catastrophic enough to both sides and the already groaning global economy."" This is a struggle that matters to Hong Kong, arguably Asia's leading financial center and a key bridge between China and the rest of the world. For one thing, Hong Kong's currency is pegged to its American counterpart, so when the greenback weakens, the Hong Kong dollar is affected. This can force the Hong Kong government to intervene, often by selling or purchasing the local currency. ""Hong Kong is part of China so tensions between the two countries will obviously affect it,"" said Richard Hu, an associate professor and China specialist at The University of Hong Kong. ""But there is particular concern about how Obama, or Romney if he's elected, handles the Chinese exchange rate issue because it will have a big impact here."" Yet the U.S. election razzmatazz hasn't exactly caught on at a grassroots level here -- most people are more concerned about issues closer to home. Unlike 2008 when Obama claimed his first election win, coverage has generally been more muted and kept to the ""World"" section of local newspapers, with China's own leadership change more likely to dominate front pages. ""People find America's election interesting, especially the debates between Obama and Romney, but they don't think too much about their policies because U.S. politics does not seem to bring much direct effect to our lives in Hong Kong,"" Vivian Kam, a local journalist, told CNN. ""Some wouldn't even know who Mitt Romney is,"" opined Tip Wan Mon Leung, a local teacher. ""Most Hong Kongers are not that political, though they do get angry about Chinese interference or expensive house prices."" When the city was handed over to China by its former British colonial rulers in 1997, Hong Kong -- now a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China -- retained many of its characteristics under the principle of ""one country, two systems"": its own currency, an independent judiciary and a separate border requiring a visa to travel between the two territories. But 15 years on, many ordinary Hong Kongers have an uneasy relationship with Beijing, fearing a gradual loss of their civil liberties. They are fiercely proud of their Chinese heritage, but many would rather keep their mainland cousins at arm's length. Hong Kong celebrates China's National Day and Chinese sporting achievements, but its citizens reject Chinese attempts to influence the city's affairs, as recent demonstrations against plans to integrate ""patriotic"" Chinese history into local schools showed. In July, an estimated 90,000 people took to the streets to protest what critics described as an attempt to ""brainwash"" impressionable young minds with pro-mainland propaganda. For all intents and purposes, Hong Kong enjoys the same freedoms Americans enjoy: free speech, a free press and a rule of law compatible with most democracies. However, Hong Kongers cannot vote for their leaders in a U.S.-style election. The city's most senior politician -- known as the chief executive -- is ""voted"" in by an electoral college of 1,200 influential but unelected figures in Hong Kong, with Beijing's approval. Earlier this year, hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded Hong Kong's streets shortly after C.Y. Leung was sworn in as the latest chief executive during a ceremony with Chinese President Hu Jintao on the 15th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty. They were demanding a say in who runs the city. Significantly, the ceremony was conducted in Mandarin rather than the local Cantonese language, viewed by many as another example of Chinese encroachment. While China doesn't overtly decide who leads Hong Kong, it does have favored candidates and says the outcome should be ""acceptable"" to the city's people even though they have no say in the process. These simmering tensions regularly expose fault-lines at a grassroots level with growing resentment against the influx of mainland visitors. Of the 41.9 million visitors to Hong Kong in 2011, the majority -- more than 28 million -- hailed from mainland China, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. Earlier this year, a full-page advertisement decrying a so-called invasion of ""locusts"" from across the border appeared in a local newspaper. The ad in the Apple Daily asked if Hong Kongers approved of spending HK$1,000,000 (US$128,925) every 18 minutes to take care of children borne by mainland parents and declared that ""Hong Kong people have had enough!"" It referred to the recent surge in the number of pregnant Chinese women crossing into Hong Kong to give birth, which has put a growing burden on the resources of local hospitals. In addition to the perception of better medical services, many mainland women choose to give birth in Hong Kong so their children have the right to stay here. But Hong Kongers also lay the blame for many of the city's problems with their own government. It is frequently accused of not doing enough to address rocketing property prices, a growing wealth gap and worsening pollution. ""I feel terribly sad about the future of Hong Kong. Too many problems, too few right people to make the right decisions,"" added Leung, who teaches high-school students. The city's famed skyline projects an image of wealth and prosperity, yet more than one million Hong Kongers live in poverty, according to the Hong Kong Council of Social Service (HKCSS). Hidden amid the city's multi-million dollar high-rise apartments and chic shopping malls are scores of tiny, unseen tenements -- some no bigger than cupboards -- that many people call home. At the other end of the scale, Hong Kong is also one of the world's richest cities, with the world's highest concentration of U.S. dollar billionaire households relative to its small size, according to a report this year by the Boston Consulting Group. Analysts estimate the government also sits on a cash pile of about US$80 billion. Yet Hong Kongers are choking on the city's success as the quality of the air at roadside level in Hong Kong deteriorates, often creating a haze that obscures one side of the city's Victoria Harbor from the other. According to research earlier this year from Hong Kong University, there are 3,200 avoidable deaths a year here due to air pollution -- more than three times higher than previous estimates. The battle for the White House will hardly go unnoticed here but it's just one strand in a China-dominated narrative.","China has been a key issue in the U.S. election campaign for both candidates .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- He had a name that rang down through generations. Ted Kennedy, far right, with brothers Bobby, center, and Jack in 1948. It was a gilded name in politics, but Ted Kennedy's life was an almost impossible kaleidoscope of outstanding public service, astonishing personal failures and the heavy burden of the unfulfilled legacies and promise of three older brothers: Joseph, Jack and Bobby. ""It reminds me, there's a great quote by Ernest Hemingway, who said, 'Everyone is broken by life, but afterwards, some are stronger in the broken places,' "" presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said. Ted, the youngest of the Kennedys, became the patriarch of the family at 36 when Bobby -- whose 1968 presidential campaign championed the sick, the poor and the elderly -- was assassinated. ""Those of us who loved him, and who take him to his rest today, pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world,"" Kennedy said in the eulogy at his brother's funeral. In the four decades since that day, the Kennedy legacy was Ted Kennedy's to fulfill, and his to write.  Watch more about Kennedy and the end of Camelot » . It's an imperfect story of an often reckless young man who lived hard and as a U.S. senator drove a car off a bridge after a party, killing a young campaign aide. He would never be president. The dream of Camelot -- as Jackie Kennedy once described her husband's brief presidency -- was over the night Kennedy conceded the primaries to President Jimmy Carter. ""For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on. The cause endures. The hope still lives, and the dream shall never die,"" he said in his keynote address at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. So Kennedy returned to the Senate, and over the next 30 years he grew older, wiser and greatly admired. In the Senate was redemption. In the Senate, the dream came alive. In the Senate early in the morning, late at night, Ted Kennedy fought and cut deals for minimum wage increases, health care, education, immigration reform, and help for the poor, the elderly and the sick. ""There are millions of people who counted on this guy every day to stand up for them. And for decades to come, history will talk about his legislative accomplishments and the difference he made in public policy,"" said Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Connecticut. Even before Kennedy's death, colleagues on the right and left mourned his absence in the health care debate. Now they feel it acutely. ""Of all the times to lose Ted Kennedy, this is the toughest time, because we're just in too many camps, it's hard to reach across the aisle, and Sen. Kennedy made it easy to reach across the aisle,"" said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Eventually, someone will fill the Senate seat of Edward Moore Kennedy, but there's pretty much universal agreement that nobody -- family or friend -- can take his place. A man has passed, taking with him a time and an era. The Kennedy legacy is written.","Ted Kennedy became the patriarch of the family at age 36 .

"(CNN) -- Twice defending champion Venus Williams moved closer to a Wimbledon title hat-trick on Monday when fourth-round rival Ana Ivanovic left in tears after quitting their Court One match through injury. Ivanovic concedes to holder Venus in tearful fashion after suffering injury anguish at Wimbledon . Serbia's former world number one lost the first set 6-1 against third-seeded American rival Williams and was serving in the first game of the second when she was forced to stop because of a thigh problem. Thirteenth-seed Ivanovic returned to court after treatment to win the game, but then quit the match -- handing Williams a place in the last eight in a highly-emotional moment. ""It's very disappointing, especially because I felt my form was getting better and better. It's really frustrating,"" Ivanovic told media while still struggling to regain her composure. ""The most disappointing thing is I felt like I wasn't given a fair chance to fight. All of a sudden I felt pain after a serve. I didn't feel anything up until that point. ""Over past few days I have felt muscle tightness, but that was normal after playing so much on the grass. ""I was serving at 30-40 down and when I landed I just felt a sharp pain on my inner thigh and I couldn't step on my leg ever since."" Williams now faces Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, the 11th seed, as she bids to become the first woman to lift three successive Wimbledon singles' titles since Steffi Graf from 1991 to 1993. Sister Serena, the second seed and a two-time Wimbledon champion, joined Venus in the last eight with a 6-3 6-1 victory over Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova. Williams turned up the heat in the first set when her family belatedly took their seats having been on Court One watching Venus. Serena opened a 4-0 lead in the second and took the match in just under an hour. She now meets eight-seeded Belarusian Victoria Azarenka who battled to beat 10th-seeded Russian Nadia Petrova 7-6 2-6 6-3. Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus has yet to drop a set in this year's event and has extended her winning streak at the All England Club to 18 matches. Radwanska, a quarterfinalist last year, triumphed 6-4 7-5 against American teenager Melanie Oudin who had to qualify for the main draw. Elena Dementieva, semifinalist a year ago, hardly broke sweat as temperatures soared, the fourth seed defeating fellow Russian blonde Elena Vesnina 6-1 6-3 in 70 minutes on Court 2. Dementieva, making her 11th Wimbledon appearance, never looked back after wrapping up the first set inside 29 minutes and now encounters either France's Virginie Razzano or Italy's Francesca Schiavone for a place in the semifinals. World number one Dinara Safina, who has yet to win a Grand Slam title, faced 2006 champion Amelie Mauresmo on Centre Court -- and Wimbledon's new roof was shut for the first time during their match when rain fell midway through the second set. Russian Safina of Russia was trailing at the time having lost the first set. But the top seed recovered for a 4-6 6-3 6-4 win and a last-eight meeting with Sabine Lisicki. Nineteen-year-old German Lisicki gained a 6-4 6-4 win over world number nine Caroline Wozniacki, of Denmark.","Title holder Venus Williams moves closer to a Wimbledon title hat-trick .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The son of the former shah of Iran called Monday for solidarity against Iran's Islamic regime, warning that the democratic movement born out of the election crisis might not succeed without international support. Reza Shah Pahlavi has lived in exile since 1979, when his father was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution. ""The moment of truth has arrived,"" Reza Shah Pahlavi said at Washington's National Press Club. ""The people of Iran need to know who stands with them."" Pahlavi has lived in exile since 1979, when his father, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution. Under the shah's regime, Iran saw nationalization of its oil and a strong movement toward modernization. Still, his secular programs and recognition of Israel cost him the support of the country's Shiite clergy, sparking clashes with the religious right and others who resented his pro-West views. The son now lives in the United States with his family, where he spends much of his time talking about the Islamic regime in Iran. During his remarks, he broke into tears when he spoke of ""bullets piercing our beloved Neda,"" a woman killed Saturday by Iranian police at a protest in Tehran, whose death has become a rallying cry among demonstrators in Iran.  Watch one woman's account of clashes with security forces » . The Iranian regime, he said, was a ""sinking Titanic"" that might not survive the demands for democracy and human rights reverberating through the country.  Watch Pahlavi call vote ""fraud"" » . Citing anecdotes from people inside the Iranian establishment, Pahlavi said he had heard that security forces have begun to distance themselves from the regime. ""It has already started,"" he said, citing reports that members of the security forces have gone home after their shifts ended and changed into plain clothes to join the protesters. ""Many, many elements within the security forces, within the Revolutionary Guard, are showing discontent,"" Pahlavi said. ""There is an amazing reflection that is happening. ... This is a movement that has blown out of proportion."" Pahlavi praised the statements and tone of President Obama, saying that any outside attempt to interfere in Iran's internal affairs ""will give the tyrants the excuse they need to paper over their own differences and target every man struggling for freedom as a foreign agent."" But he said there was a difference between interfering in a country's sovereign affairs and standing for principles of human rights and democracy. ""We welcome that. This is effective. It is important,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Forty-four years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was gunned down on the balcony of a Memphis hotel, the Tennessee city is overcoming what some call protracted guilt and embarrassment, and naming a street in his honor. A nearly 1-mile stretch of Linden Avenue will be renamed Dr. M.L. King Jr. Avenue on Wednesday, the anniversary of the civil rights leader's assassination. The honor has been a long time coming. More than 900 U.S. cities have streets named after King. The largest concentration is in the South, led by Georgia, which has more than 70 roads named after the Atlanta native, according to an article by Derek H. Alderman of East Carolina University in the New Georgia Encyclopedia. But in the city where he died, the omission has been, to many, glaring. ""We never wanted to address losing Dr. King's life here,"" said former Memphis City Councilman Berlin Boyd, who helped lead the street-naming effort. Born and raised in Memphis, Boyd, 34, said he always wondered why there was no official street tribute for King. During his brief five-month term in a vacated council seat -- from August to January -- Boyd decided to get the ball rolling. ""I had the opportunity to do something, and we got it done,"" Boyd said. The east-west Linden Avenue, while less famous than Beale Street with its many blues clubs and restaurants just a block north, was selected because that was where King marched in support of striking sanitation workers. The avenue also was a pivotal location during the strike. A photo shows the civil rights leader on Linden, Boyd said. The council proposal was approved earlier this year by a land-use control board. ""He marched along this street; we wanted something that had a real nexus to this city,"" said Mayor A.C. Wharton. One of Dr. King's associates during the 1968 sanitation workers' march was the Rev. James Netters, a former city council member. Netters advocated for an intersection in honor of King in the early 1970s; The council decided to rename a portion of Interstate 240 as a substitute, he said. ""Naming Linden is better than nothing,"" Netters said. The downtown thoroughfare is close to the historic Clayborn-Ball Temple, a focal point for many meetings of the sanitation strikers. King was scheduled to speak there on April 3, 1968, but, because of a large crowd, the rally was moved to Mason Temple. It was there that he delivered his famous ""I've Been to the Mountaintop"" address. Linden Avenue is a busy downtown thoroughfare and is on one side of FedExForum, home of the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. The area around the street is undergoing a significant transformation, Wharton said. ""This is the right time"" to rename the street, the mayor said. Demolition of a public housing project is making way for a mixed-use development, and other projects will change the landscape. Long-term plans include naming up to 5 miles of Linden Avenue for King. King was killed April 4, 1968, by James Earl Ray. The National Civil Rights Museum, located at the Lorraine Motel where he was killed, will sponsor a commemoration on the anniversary date. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was with King at the Lorraine, said the assassination left Memphis with a deep sense of pain and guilt. He contends the city could ""do more to memorialize Dr. King's legacy."" For the city, the street naming is a large symbolic step in honoring King. ""There is no way we could do enough for him ... that would measure up to what he gave up the United States of America,"" Wharton said.","A 1-mile stretch of Linden Avenue will be named after the civil rights leader .

"New York (CNN) -- A prominent Muslim civil liberties group held a small rally Friday outside New York police headquarters, continuing its call for the resignation of Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and other reforms within the department. The Council on American-Islamic Relations wants Kelly to step down because of his participation in a film that they say paints all Muslims as terrorists. ""Due to the fact that the police commissioner and Mayor (Michael) Bloomberg both refuse to accept the severity of their actions, or meet with local Islamic leaders in an attempt to mend the situation, we as a community with full force must stand up to the mistreatment and dismissal of our community at large,"" the group's website said. ""Silence and lack of reaction to this pressing issue will only allow this type systematic persecution of a minority community to continue and escalate without any reprimand."" Muslim activists say ""The Third Jihad,"" a documentary about radical Islam, vilifies the American-Muslim community and teaches police officers to suspect Muslims as terrorists. Muslim activists have also called for Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne to resign, saying he first denied and only later admitted that Kelly was interviewed for the film. ""They were not telling the truth about their involvement in the propaganda film against Muslims,"" said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, adding that New York ""deserves people they trust who do not discriminate against people."" The film's producer, Raphael Shore, said in a statement that the film accurately portrays radical Islam: . ""Those that have blasted the film are attempting to stifle an important debate about the internal state of the Muslim community in America, and whether politicized Islam and indoctrination pose tangible security threats,"" Shore said. According to documents obtained by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, the film was screened during a New York Police Department terrorism training course that more than 1,000 officers attended. In a statement released last week, Kelly acknowledged that he had been interviewed for the film five years ago by a filmmaker and, ""while it never became part of the department's curriculum, and was not authorized for any training,"" the film had been screened ""for an extended period in 2010"" in a room where officers were on break from training. According to the statement, the screening stopped after an officer who was offended by it brought it to department officials' attention. ""I offer my apologies to members of the Muslim community, in particular, who would find the film inflammatory and its airing on Department property, though unauthorized, to be inappropriate,"" Kelly said. Awad said the police commissioner's apology was not enough. ""It's not personal, but from our standpoint, our trust in the police chief has been eroded,"" he said. ""He needs to resign.""

"(CNN) -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers in Washington State voted Wednesday in favor of a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage, putting Washington on the path toward becoming the seventh state in the nation to legalize marriage for gay and lesbian couples. ""With today's vote, we tell the nation that Washington state will no longer deny our citizens the opportunity to marry the person they love,"" said Gov. Chris Gregoire, a Demorcrat who has vowed to sign it. ""We tell every child of same-sex couples that their family is every bit as equal and important as all other families in our state. And we take a major step toward completing a long and important journey to end discrimination based on sexual orientation."" The law will go into effect in June, when the legislative session ends, unless opponents halt its implementation by putting it on the November 2012 ballot. The 55-43 vote in the House included two Republicans in support of the bill. The Senate vote last week was 28-21 and included four Republicans. ""Like thousands of other same-sex couples, my partner Eric and I are very grateful for these protections that the law now provide,"" said state Rep. Jamie Pedersen, a Democrat, moments before the vote. ""But domestic partnership is a pale and inadequate substitute for marriage."" In America: Inside my society-destroying family . State Rep. Jay Rodne, a Republican, disagreed. ""Marriage is about life,"" he said. ""It's about joining that man and that woman as husband and wife and mother and father, linking them with their natural-born children or adoptive parents and carrying forward our civilization."" The National Organization for Marriage, which opposes the law, has said it will seek to gather the 120,577 signatures needed to put the issue to voters as a referendum in November. The group did not immediately return a call. Joseph Backholm, director of the Family Policy Institute of Washington, has said the issue should be put to a public vote. ""If we as a state are going to take the position that mothers and fathers are interchangeable and replaceable, if we are going to send a message to fathers and potential fathers in this state that it isn't important to be in the lives of their children because dads specifically don't matter, that is something we should all do together,"" he said last month. Preacher: Why I fight for traditional marriage . But Thalia Zepatos, director of public engagement for Freedom to Marry, questioned the fairness of a vote. ""Is it appropriate for all the voters to vote on the rights of a small minority group of people?"" she asked. Advocates of same-sex marriage have followed several paths toward legality in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Iowa, New York and the District of Columbia. ""In each state, the question of marriage has come up either through the courts, through the legislatures or directly at the ballot,"" Zepatos said. ""I think this demonstrates the growing support nationally amongst Republicans, Democrats and Independents who see that allowing committed and loving, same-sex couples to get married does not take anything away from the marriages of their friends, neighbors and family members."" The benefits of same-sex marriage translate into benefits for the larger community, said Zepatos, citing one study that predicted $88 million in additional spending would occur in Washington once the practice becomes legal. ""It's a real boost for small business in particular,"" she said. Preacher: Why I support same-sex marriage . In 2009, Maine state legislators passed a same-sex marriage bill that drew subsequent challenges by opponents who pushed for a referendum that ultimately overturned the law with 53% of the vote. Proponents are trying to get it back on the ballot this year. Gay rights advocates have already garnered thousands of signatures in an effort to force a second referendum in November. In California, a 2008 public vote outlawed gay and lesbian couples' right to wed. Two years later, a federal district court overturned the voter-approved measure known as Proposition 8, saying couples were unfairly denied their rights. A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday against California's ban, arguing that it unconstitutionally singles out gays and lesbians for discrimination. Sound off on iReport: What's your view? The ban has remained in place during the appeals process and could soon get a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar battles have unfolded in Maryland, where same-sex marriage opponents have pressed for referendums to counter bills that appear to enjoy growing support in their state houses.

"(CNN) -- Vincent Kompany has signed a new six-year contract with Manchester City -- the longest contract offered to a player in the club's history. It is unusual for players to be offered more than five years for a contract, but the 26-year-old Belgian has been a key figure for City and captained the club to their first league title in 44 years last season. ""For me if you are good somewhere then there is no reason to look elsewhere. Man City as a project is not just a project of the owners or the people employed by the club; it is also my project,"" Kompany told the club's website.

"(CNN) -- A diplomatic source told CNN that the courier who was in close contact with Osama bin Laden and who eventually led the United States to him was a Kuwaiti named Abu Ahmad. U.S. officials have said that when the identity of the courier -- who they have not named -- was established in 2007 the U.S. began a path to the house in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the al Qaeda leader was living. Analysis of assessments of detainees held at the U.S. Navy's detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, include several mentions of a man by the name of Abu Ahmad al Kuwaiti, who was reportedly close to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- also a Kuwaiti. The information on the detainee assessments came from U.S. Defense Department documents published by WikiLeaks. Since the operation that killed bin Laden, U.S. officials have described the courier they were tracking as a protege of Mohammed and another senior member of al Qaeda, Abu Faraj al Libi, a Libyan detainee who was named as al Qaeda's third most senior leader when he was captured in May 2005. Bin Laden killing caps decade-long manhunt . One assessment -- compiled in October 2008 -- concerns a Saudi citizen called Maad al Qathani, the man who was intended to be the ""20th hijacker"" on 9/11 but who failed to gain entry to the United States. It said: ""Detainee is associated with other key al-Qaida members including senior operations planners Khalid Shaykh Muhammad."" The document later said that al Qathani ""received computer training from al-Qaida member Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in preparation for his mission to the U.S."" Al Kuwaiti was then ""a senior al Qaeda facilitator and subordinate"" of Mohammed. The assessment added: ""Al-Kuwaiti worked in the al-Qaida media house operated by KU-10024 (Mohammed) in Kandahar and served as a courier."" No obvious replacement to succeed bin Laden as al Qaeda's leader . Al Qathani reportedly spent about three months in basic training with al Qaeda from December 2000 to February 2001 when he was introduced to bin Laden. Establishing al Qathani's association with Mohammed, the assessment continued: ""Detainee stated UBL told him that since he (detainee) loved to serve his religion, he must go to KU-10024, who will ask him to ""do things."" It was the first of several encounters with the al Qaeda leader, to whom al Qathani swore a personal oath of allegiance. The document established that al Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden and traveled with him. ""Al-Kuwaiti was seen in Tora Bora and it is possible al-Kuwaiti was one of the individuals detainee reported accompanying UBL in Tora Bora prior to UBL's disappearance,"" it says. In an assessment of al Qathani's intelligence value, the document noted that he ""had access to the inner circles of al-Qaida through his interactions with senior al-Qaida members including UBL, (Ayman al-) Zawahiri, KU-10024 (Mohammed) and others."" Al-Zawahiri was al Qaeda's No. 2 man under bin Laden. Another detainee assessment also mentioned al Kuwaiti. It was of an Indonesian member of al Qaeda called Riduan Isomuddin, who had spent nearly two years in the 1980s fighting jihad in Pakistan and Afghanistan. He also knew Mohammed, according to the assessment, which said that ""in November 2001, detainee and his wife left Kandahar for Karachi. They stayed at the Abu Ahmad al Kuwaiti guest house for two weeks."" Al Qaeda operated a network of guest houses (or safe houses) in Afghanistan and Pakistan before and immediately after the 9/11 attacks. Isomuddin was captured in August 2003 in Thailand by a joint Thai-U.S. operation and is described in the assessment as a ""high-value detainee."" CNN has been unable to confirm with U.S. officials the identity of the courier, but several factors point to al Kuwaiti as the courier who inadvertently led the United States to bin Laden's hiding place: al Kuwaiti's reported history with the organization, his access to senior leaders, his description in the Guantanamo assessment as a courier, and the fact that he was never captured. CNN has been unable to establish whether he was at the compound when U.S. forces staged their raid or whether he was killed in the operation.","U.S. officials have said the identity of the courier was established in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- The 5-year-olds in Janet Vollmer's kindergarten class heard the noise: Pop. Pop. Pop. What was that noise? They looked to Vollmer for answers. They were too young to understand what it meant when they heard the gunfire Friday outside their classroom door at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. They never heard of Columbine. They didn't know anything about Virginia Tech. These children, at that tender age, couldn't comprehend the kind of carnage created by a mass shooting -- the same kind of shooting that by the end of the day would make their school the scene of the second worst school shooting in U.S. history. Shooting triggers 'mind battle' for Columbine victims . Outside Vollmer's classroom, a heavily armed gunman wearing black fatigues and a military vest was taking aim at children and educators. In a few minutes, 20 children and six educators were dead. Eighteen of the pupils -- between the ages of 5 and 10 -- died where they fell, investigators say. Two more were pronounced dead at an area hospital. Inside the classroom, Vollmer's job -- as it has been nearly every day for 18 years -- was to keep the children calm, focused on the task at hand. ""You could hear what sounded like pops, gunshots,"" she told CNN late Friday. Timeline: Worst mass shootings in U.S. The children had been through emergency lockdown drills at the schools. So when Vollmer locked the doors and put the blinds down they knew what to do, ""go over in the safe area"" in the back of the classroom. There, Vollmer read to the children. Still the children knew something was not right. ""It didn't seem a natural thing to them,"" she said. When they asked questions about what was happening, Vollmer and her teaching aides told them: ""We're not really sure, but we're going to be safe, because we're sitting over here and we're all together."" First-grade teacher Kaitlin Roig heard what sounded like the rapid firing of an assault rifle. ""I knew something was wrong,"" she told ABC ""World News"" anchor Diane Sawyer. She herded the 14 children, ages 6 and 7, into the class bathroom. She helped some climb onto the toilet so they could all fit in the tiny room. Then she locked the door. ""I just told them we have to be absolutely quiet,"" Roig told Sawyer. As the minutes ticked by, the children asked Roig if the could ""go see if anyone is out there."" No, she told them. What really makes schools safer? ""If they started crying, I would take their face and tell them, 'It's going to be OK.' I wanted that to be the last thing they heard, not the gunfire in the hall."" In a nearby classroom, 8-year-old Alexis Wasik didn't know what was going on. She, too, heard the shots. But it wasn't until she heard the sirens wail that she and her classmates put it together: A shooting at the school. ""Everybody was crying,"" she told CNN. Alexis and her classmates huddled together in the back of the classroom. ""We heard an ambulance and police officer come and everyone was a little scared, crying, and I felt actually a little sick and like I was going to throw up,"" she later told ABC's Sawyer. ""Kids were crying, not really like screaming, but they were all huddling together."" Back in Vollmer's classroom, she was concentrating on her job ""to keep them safe."" There was no announcement over the school's loudspeaker to announce an emergency, a routine occurrence during emergency drills. ""My instinct was that it wasn't good,"" Vollmer said. School shooting: Shattering the sense of safety . What Vollmer didn't know was that the principal, Dawn Hochsprung, and school psychologist Mary Sherlach had been shot and killed. Soon police officers were banging on Vollmer's classroom door. The kindergartners were told to line up and cover their eyes as they were led by police out of the school to a nearby firehouse, Vollmer said. Police also evacuated Roig and her students to the firehouse. Somewhere in the school building, authorities later said, was the gunman's body. Police believe he committed suicide, turning a gun on himself. Also in the building, the bodies of classmates and faculty. As reports of the shooting made their way around town, frantic parents descended on a nearby firehouse where the children had been taken. ""Why? Why?"" one woman wailed as she walked up a wooded roadway leading from the school. Inside the firehouse, Vollmer's kindergartners were beginning to understand something terrible had happened. ""They saw other people upset,"" Vollmer said. ""We just held them close until their parents came."" A parents' promise: I will keep you safe . Alexis also ended up at the firehouse. There, she was reunited with her mother. ""It just doesn't seem real,"" Alexis' mother told WABC. ""It feels like a nightmare. You drop your kids at school, hugs and kisses, have a good day, I'll see you later and see you at the end of the day and you never know, in 20 minutes from now what's going to happen.""

"KARACHI, Pakistan (CNN) -- It's a documentary with an alarming message: Two American boys are held captive in a madrassa, a Pakistani religious school, once visited by Osama bin Laden and with ties to the Taliban. Noor and Mehboob Khan were 13 and 12 when they first talked with the filmmaker. The film, ""Karachi Kids,"" describes threats to artistic freedom of expression from the teaching of conservative Islam. Early copies of the film prompted outrage after the story of the American boys appeared on Fox News, CBS and other news outlets. It also led to demands from Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, for the boys to be returned home. But the independent filmmaker may have confused the madrassa with one with a similar name tied to Islamic extremists. The madrassa the boys attended isn't linked to bin Laden or Muslim radicals; instead, it's one the U.S. State Department says is preferred by Pakistani-Americans for its moderate Islamic teachings and one recently visited by a top U.S. diplomat in Pakistan. How could the filmmaker have got it so wrong? He blames the error on researchers he says he has since dismissed.  Watch madrassa official explain: ""We tell them don't kill anyone"" » . ""I do need to take responsibility for these things in terms of these were errors that sort of spun out of control,"" filmmaker Imran Raza said. ""I have to take responsibility for the mistakes. I take responsibility for the error in the allegation that Osama bin Laden was there. I take responsibility for the error that some of the Taliban leaders were there."" CNN learned about brothers, Noor and Mehboob Khan, ages 17 and 16, when Raza offered CNN the documentary this summer. The film focuses on the brothers, whose father, a Pakistani-born taxi driver in Atlanta, Georgia, sent them to Pakistan to get them in touch with their religious heritage. In the film, Raza describes the teens as captives being force-fed radical jihad. In interviews over three years, the boys describe their longing for America and say the terrorist attacks of September 11 weren't carried out by Muslims. One of the brothers described punishment by beatings at the madrassa. Raza started a campaign to return the boys to the United States. McCaul offered to help, even asking Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to intervene. Both teens returned to their suburban Atlanta home in July after completing their studies. But before the boys returned home, CNN visited them at the Jamia Binoria madrassa in Karachi. The boys appeared proud that they had completed their studies, including the memorization of the Quran. But they also were very glad to be heading home to American food. ""Hot wings,"" exclaimed Mehboob, giving the CNN reporter a high five. ""I feel very happy that after four years, I'm going back."" Tucked away on 12 acres in Karachi's industrial district, the madrassa is one of the largest religious schools in Pakistan and hosts the largest number of foreign students in the country. The school is home to as many as 500 boys and girls from 29 countries and teaches Sunni Deobandi Islam, a theology that analysts say is associated with some militant groups in Pakistan. CNN was welcomed in the school and spoke to its head, who denied the allegations made in the documentary. ""This is a madrassa, not some jail,"" said Mohammad Naeem, the head of the school known as a mufti. Naeem said his school -- one of 13,000 madrassas registered in Pakistan -- never keeps students against their will, adding that the Khan brothers stayed of their own free will. He, too, denied any ties to militant groups, saying that if students or teachers were ever tied to extremists groups, they would be removed from the school immediately. Back in Atlanta, Noor Khan said the whole experience gave him a better appreciation of America, his family and his faith. ""I am glad I was sent to Pakistan because it taught me to be a better person. It taught me to appreciate what I had before, and I knew when I came back I wasn't going to make the same mistake of not appreciating what I have,"" he said. He added, ""I was never held against my will."" Noor said the ""beatings"" he referred to in the film were the equivalent of when American teachers years ago used to smack students on their wrists to reinforce a lesson. ""Pakistan is, what, 50 years behind America, so they do the same thing. They take a stick and hit you softly on the hand so you learn a lesson, but that didn't bother me,"" he said. Did he see radicalism there? ""Look, I am Muslim, and one of the main things they teach us to do is not to lie,"" he said. ""I witnessed with my own eyes: no Taliban, no Taliban training, no terrorist, no extremism -- nothing at all at the madrassa. The only thing they wanted to do was teach the history of Islam. That's all."" He says the comments of his talking about September 11 in the documentary were twisted and taken out of context. He said what he meant was that the hijackers weren't ""true Muslims."" ""If those were Muslims, they weren't true Muslims,"" he said. ""We Muslims, we don't kill people. We're not terrorists. ... We're not violent people. We just want to live a happy life."" He then sought to make clear: ""I've never met the Taliban; no one showed me how do any terrorist training or activities. I've never witnessed that with my own eyes, and when the media comes to our madrassa, our principal tells to their face, 'All the classes, all the rooms are open to you. You are free to go wherever you want.' "" Pakistan's religious affairs ministry said the Jamia Binoria school is a moderate Islamic institution. A U.S. State Department source confirmed that, saying the school ""is known to U.S. officials as a moderate institution, favored by Pakistani-Americans for its moderate and tolerant Islamic instruction."" In fact, a report by the International Crisis Group -- provided by McCaul's office and the documentary filmmaker -- says the Jamia Binoria Madrassa is often mistaken for another. ""Because of its name, this madrassa is often confused with the more prominent and powerful Binori Town Madrassa,"" the report says. The other madrassa is the one that intelligence sources say is the school bin Laden visited and, according to the report, is the ""fountainhead of Deobandi militancy countrywide. ... It also boasts close ties to the Taliban."" CNN also found a photograph in a local newspaper of the U.S. vice consul general visiting with one of the principals of the school the boys attended. The boy's father, Fazal Rahim Khan, said his sons never needed rescuing, just an exit visa. He said he was surprised when he saw reports of McCaul coming to his sons' aid, because he never asked for the congressman's help. He said he had searched the world to find the appropriate madrassa to send his American sons to learn about Islam. ""For this purpose, I send my children to learn good morals, good behavior, good citizen and good people,"" he said. He gets angered at the way he says his sons' words were manipulated. ""If I knew something was going on or something [was] wrong and they are against the United States or against the British ... what do you think, I would be happy to send my children? No. ""I sent my children to learn the Quran, the way of Allah, the way of life."" McCaul still stands by his belief that the school is involved in militancy, saying in a written statement that the ""Taliban is known to recruit from Deobandi madrassas, including Jamia Binoria, and train their recruits as terrorists. ... Any Americans among the recruits represent a potential threat to the United States because of their unfettered access to this country."" What about Raza, the filmmaker? He stands by his depiction of how the madrassa transformed the teens but is re-editing his film to take out the references about bin Laden visiting and the Taliban leaders attending. CNN's Zain Verjee, Richard Griffiths and Sophia Ahmad contributed to this report.","Film portrays Pakistan madrassa as linked to terror, holding U.S. boys captive .

"BEIJING, China  -- As Wimbledon 2009 gets under way this week, sports commentators and tennis aficionados will closely watch China's tennis superstar, Zheng Jie. China's Zheng Jie during her semifinal tennis match  against Serena Williams at Wimbledon . She is one of the seeded players who could steal the limelight in women's singles. If she does -- she won her first preliminary match on Monday -- it won't be the first time. Zheng captured the hearts of many at Wimbledon last year when she beat top-seed Ana Ivanovic in the third round. ""Ana is the world number one player, I won over her and that gave me a so much confidence,"" she told CNN, recalling one of the biggest upsets in Wimbledon history. ""With that confidence I played into the semifinals,"" the diminutive player added. Her remarkable run stumped some commentators who could barely pronounce her name, (her surname is pronounced ""Jung"", her first name ""Gee-yeah"") so unknown was the wild card ranked 133rd in the world. It was a fairytale story for the Sichuan native, who became the first wildcard to reach the semis of the women's singles at Wimbledon. Her performances inspired her country, with more than 100 million Chinese watching the live TV coverage of her semifinal match against America's Serena Williams. Though Zheng lost, it was by far the best performance ever by a Chinese player at a major. ""When I returned to China, I was welcomed by a huge crowd at the airport,"" she gushes. ""I was thrilled that I could turn so many people's attention to tennis."" Zheng won even more points off court. She donated her Wimbledon prize money to the Sichuan earthquake relief fund and spent time helping the victims and reconstruction efforts. ""My parents and most of my friends are in Sichuan,"" she said. ""I hope I can do more to help them."" Zheng learned the rudiments of tennis growing up as a child in China's lush and rustic heartland. She was barely seven when she tried out in a local sports clinic to train for tennis, a sport her parents had never even heard of. She trained doggedly, showing speed and boundless enthusiasm. When the coaches chose two from the scores of trainees, they selected her -- along with Yan Zi, a fellow Sichuanese and long-time women's doubles partner. Zheng is mostly known for her women's doubles successes partnered with Yan Zi. They have won several WTA doubles titles, including Wimbledon 2006 and the bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Zheng's career path as a singles player is less straight. She started her pro tennis tour in January 2003 and by the end of that year, she had moved into the world's top 100. By 2005, she ranked 42nd. But she suffered an ankle injury at the 2007 French Open, forcing her to miss all events that year, including the chance to defend her Wimbledon women's doubles title. Her world ranking plunged as she underwent rehabilitation. On the eve of Wimbledon 2008, she was ranked 133. ""Even though the injury made my world ranking plunge, it also made me grow up a lot,"" she recalls. When she returned to competition, she carried on the court a small bottle containing the bone fragments cut from her ankle, just to remind her of how lucky she was to compete again. More accolades followed her success. Last March, Zheng got the 2008 WTA Tour ""Comeback of the Year"" award for having ""rebounded from an injury-marred 2007."" Thanks to the emergence of world-class stars like Zheng, tennis is growing rapidly in China. An affluent middle class and many top government officials have taken up the sport, boosting its social status and commercial appeal. Tennis courts have sprouted in major cities while academies are attracting youths who idolize super-stars like Roger Federer, Serena Williams and local standouts like Zheng Jie. Zheng's success -- she is said to have earned over $1.8 million in prize money as a pro -- has also helped put the spotlight on tennis, attracting wider TV coverage and lucrative commercial endorsements. ""I really like playing tennis and I was ambitious,"" she told CNN about her youth. ""If you say I can't make it, I'll prove to you that I can."" With Zheng's mental toughness and will to win, Wimbledon fans may have to get used to hearing her name, properly pronounced ""Jung Gee-yeah"".","Zheng Jie reached the semifinals of Wimbledon last year as a wildcard entry .

"London (CNN) -- EADS and BAE Systems have dropped plans to merge after failing to win political support for a $45 billion deal that would have created a European aerospace and defense giant. ""It has become clear that the interests of the parties' government stakeholders cannot be adequately reconciled with each other or with the objectives that BAE Systems and EADS established for the merger,"" the companies said in a statement Wednesday. Read more detail: CNNMoney . France and Germany were keen to retain political influence in a merged company, a stance Britain believed would have put at risk BAE's privileged access to military contracts in the United States. Barry Norris, founding partner of Argonaut Capital Partners, an investor in EADS, told CNN: ""we think today's decision to terminate merger talks is actually a triumph for common sense and shareholder value."" He added: ""It's easy to forget that these are companies owned by their shareholders."" Watch: What went wrong? A merger would have brought together the maker of Airbus planes with Europe's largest arms manufacturer and created a global rival to U.S. defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing. Several British lawmakers, including Conservative Member of Parliament Ben Wallace, wrote to Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this month, raising concerns about the deal. BAE and EADS believed that together they would be able to generate stronger growth by achieving a better revenue balance between civil aviation and defense, but that commercial rationale was challenged by some major investors. ""We are obviously disappointed that we were unable to reach an acceptable agreement with our various government stakeholders,"" BAE Systems Chief Executive Ian King said.

"(CNN) -- The husband of a Saudi rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison said his wife is ""a crushed human being,"" but blamed a judge -- not the Saudi judicial system -- for treating her as a criminal. Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim. Saudi society is respectful of women, he said, adding that he had faith his wife would get justice. The ruling relates to an incident in March 2006 when the woman, then 18 and engaged to be married, and an unrelated man were abducted from a mall in Qatif, Saudi Arabia, by a group of seven men. She was later raped. In October, the men were convicted and sentenced to two to nine years in prison for the assault. She was convicted of violating the kingdom's strict Islamic law by not having a male guardian with her at the mall. ""From the outset, my wife was dealt with as a guilty person who committed a crime,"" said her 24-year-old husband. ""She was not given any chance to prove her innocence or describe how she was a victim of multiple brutal rapes."" The husband, who asked to remain unnamed, spoke to CNN senior Arab affairs editor Octavia Nasr. His wife, who he said is ""a quiet, simple person who does not bother anyone,"" is ill and too fragile to speak about the case, he said. As her guardian under Saudi law, he is standing up for her publicly.  Watch the victim's husband speak out » . The attack, trial and sentencing have taken a heavy toll on his wife's already-poor health, he said. She suffers from anemia, a blood disorder and asthma, and will have surgery next month to remove her gallbladder, he said. ""Since the attack, she's been suffering from severe depression."" The events ended her pursuit of an education past high school, he said. ""Her situation keeps changing from bad to worse,"" he said. ""You could say she's a crushed human being."" ""The court proceedings were like a spectacle at times,"" he said. ""The criminals were allowed in the same room as my wife. They were allowed to make all kinds of offensive gestures and give her dirty and threatening looks."" Of the three judges at the trial, one of them ""was mean and from the beginning dealt with my wife as guilty person who had done something wrong,"" he said. ""Even when he pronounced the sentence, he said to her, 'You were involved in a suspicious relationship, and you deserve 200 lashes for that,' "" he said. The judge dismissed her lawyer, Abdulrahman al-Lahim, after the two clashed in court, he said. ""The judge took things personally and was reacting to our lawyer, who's a known human rights activist,"" the husband said. ""The judge undermined the lawyer, decreased his role and then dismissed him from the case altogether. The judge simply couldn't work with our lawyer."" The woman was originally sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes. But when she appealed, the court more than doubled her sentence. The husband said the judge was pursuing ""a personal vendetta."" ""We were shocked when the judgment changed and her sentence was doubled,"" the husband said. ""We were looking for pardon; instead, she got double the whipping and more jail time."" A court source told Arab News, an English-language Middle Eastern daily newspaper, that the woman's sentence was increased after the woman spoke to the media about the case. But a Saudi Justice Ministry statement said the permanent committee of the Supreme Judicial Council recommended an increased sentence for the woman after further evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence. ""If this sentence is based on the law, then I would've welcomed it,"" the husband said. ""But it is harsh, and the Saudi society I know and belong to is more sympathetic than that. I do not expect such harshness from Saudis, but rather compassion and support of the victim and her rights."" Saudi society is very respectful to women in general, he said. The case, which has sparked media scrutiny of the Saudi legal system, has drawn a strong international reaction. Human Rights Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah ""to immediately void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer."" Under law in Saudi Arabia, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition on driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man, and they are not allowed to vote. The Saudi government recently has taken steps to better the situation of women in the kingdom, including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases, adoption of a new labor law and the creation of a human rights commission.

"(Financial Times) -- China's smog-ridden capital issued an unprecedented set of new anti-pollution measures at the weekend, as the authorities scramble to respond to rising public pressure over the city's deteriorating air quality. The far-reaching measures target everything from outdoor barbecues and dusty construction sites, to paint fumes and idling car engines, representing the city's broadest effort yet to fight the persistent pollution haze over Beijing. The Beijing city government published a draft of the new rules on its website on Saturday and asked for public feedback -- an unusual step that illustrates how carefully the government is treading around the hot-button issue. Earlier this month, an episode of extraordinarily bad pollution in Beijing sparked public outcry over air quality, as well as causing a sudden increase in hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses and heart attacks. China's double-digit economic growth in the past three decades has been accompanied by widespread environmental degradation, of which air pollution in the capital has become the latest, and most visible, symbol. Although the Beijing city government has in the past tried to conceal its pollution problem by manipulating air quality data, public pressure has forced it adopt a radically more open stance. The city government now publishes hourly pollution data and even pollution forecasts to help citizens deal with the haze. In a sign of the growing severity of the problem, the new regulations published on Saturday describe ""emergency measures"" for days when pollution becomes a ""danger to human health"", including mandatory factory closures and restrictions on vehicles. The draft rules also outline a new cap-and-trade scheme for key pollutants, and will require the largest culprits to publicly disclose their emissions -- which environmentalists said was a step toward greater transparency. ""The draft law it is really trying to tackle the issue in a proactive way, trying to tackle the pollution at its source,"" said Ma Jun, a prominent environmentalist in Beijing and author of China's Water Crisis. However, he added that firm implementation of the rules, which has thwarted similar environmental laws in the past, would continue to be a challenge. The draft regulations, which span dozens of pages, also describe a range of smaller measures that could change some of the key features of life in the capital, if strictly implemented. Restaurants and caterers will be banned from burning coal -- a measure that will threaten Beijing's beloved lamb kebabs, known as yangrou chuan. Vehicles will be prohibited from idling their engines for more than three minutes if parked near a school or a hospital, and cars will be subject to random testing for emissions compliance. Some parts of the new regulations simply reiterate rules that were already in place -- such as requirements for dust-control measures at construction sites -- but have been poorly implemented because the environmental authorities have lacked clout. ""To make this happen the key thing is oversight,"" said Zhou Rong, air pollution specialist at Greenpeace in Beijing. ""The government put this up on the web because they understand that everyone is watching this issue -- this is a big improvement."" © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","China's smog-ridden capital issued an unprecedented set of new anti-pollution measures .

"(CNN) -- The inaugural addresses of the presidents are, for the most part, a wasteland of howling rhetoric and dried-out inspiration. History has little noted, nor has it long remembered, more than a handful of them. Lincoln's two inaugural addresses stand (of course) as the great exception. Franklin Roosevelt's addresses in 1933 and 1937 remain alive, as does the sonorous rhetoric of John F. Kennedy's address in 1961. We continue to quote a single sentence from Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural, a sentence from Ronald Reagan's first and a two-word phrase from Lyndon Johnson's. After that ... After that, you get a lot of this: . ""Liberty -- liberty within the law -- and civilization are inseparable, and though both were threatened, we find them now secure; and there comes to Americans the profound assurance that our representative government is the highest expression and surest guaranty of both."" Who said that? It could have been any one of 20 presidents. (In this case, the speaker happens to be Warren G. Harding.) Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it. Theodore Roosevelt failed. Dwight Eisenhower failed. Barack Obama failed the first time, and since second inaugural addresses are almost always even worse than firsts, it seems almost certain he'll fail again on Monday. Why do inaugural addresses fail? They fail for two reasons: One subject to the speaker's control; the other, not. They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments. Grand language wrapped around a thin message produces only vapid blather. Consider, for example, this passage from Obama's first inaugural address: . ""On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation. But in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history ...."" Unfortunately for Obama, those words were false as description and therefore inaccurate as prediction. You might say that the line ""we come to proclaim an end to ... false promises"" was itself a false promise. Good writing can never come from bad thinking. Zelizer: Learning from Lincoln, Wilson, FDR . But there's another source of failure, one not so easily corrected. Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency cannot deliver. Listen to this inspiring passage: . ""The elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the Constitution of 1787. No thoughtful man can fail to appreciate its beneficent effect upon our institutions and people. It has freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution. It has added immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people. It has liberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged and enfeebled both. ""It has surrendered to their own guardianship the manhood of more than 5,000,000 people, and has opened to each one of them a career of freedom and usefulness. It has given new inspiration to the power of self-help in both races by making labor more honorable to the one and more necessary to the other. The influence of this force will grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years."" ""No doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our Southern communities. This is to be deplored, though it was perhaps unavoidable. But those who resisted the change should remember that under our institutions there was no middle ground for the negro race between slavery and equal citizenship."" Those were the words of James A. Garfield. Between Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson, no president expressed a stronger personal commitment to equal rights for black Americans than Garfield in 1881. Yet this commitment is remembered today only by historians. Garfield was assassinated in September 1881, serving barely six months in office. Even had Garfield served a full term, his efforts would almost certainly have failed. Federal enforcement of the voting rights of Southern blacks; federal funding of equal education for black children -- to become reality, these aspirations of Garfield's required support from courts, Congress and public opinion. None would have been forthcoming. Garfield's aspirations were doomed to fail by forces of opposition too strong for him to overcome. Garfield's noble summons went unheeded at the time and therefore inspires little interest now. An inaugural address is a plan for what is to come. Even a good president can deliver a bad speech. In fact, they usually do. But however beautifully written, a speech can only be made great by the presidency that follows. An inaugural address is a plan, and the test of a plan is the result. A speech can fail all by itself. Its ideas can be weak, its language can be foggy. But even if the ideas are clear and the words crisp, an inaugural address can be deemed ""great"" only if it is followed by actions that make good on its lofty words. This is why we still remember the mighty words of Lincoln and FDR and why we forget almost all the others. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Most inaugural speeches are full of rhetoric, lack real inspiration .
He says they tend to promise great things but are vague on specific commitments .
There are noble speeches that get undermined by lack of accomplishment, Frum says .
Frum: We remember great speeches of Lincoln, FDR because of their great deeds ."
"(CNN)  -- As a player who has won African and Olympic titles with Cameroon and Spanish league and Champions League titles with Barcelona as well as three African footballer of the year awards, Samuel Eto'o expects to command respect. Barcelona star Samuel Eto'o is one of a number of top footballers who have spoken out against racism. Yet Eto's spectacular career in Spain, where his goalscoring prowess have made him one of the world's most feared and admired strikers, has been punctuated by incidents in which he has been the victim of sickening racist abuse. Memorably, Eto'o started to walk off the pitch in protest during a match at Real Zaragoza in 2006 after being taunted by home supporters chanting monkey noises only to be persuaded to return by his Barcelona teammates and the club's coach, Frank Rijkaard. ""I was leaving the field and if it wasn't for Rijkaard, my teammates and the referee, I would have done it,"" Eto'o recalls. ""In that moment you start thinking whether there is something wrong with being black, you know? But I think we are all humans, everyone's blood is the same color and we all have the same heart. I don't see any differences in skin color."" While Spanish football's reputation for sophistication and flair has made la Liga one of the most attractive and marketable competitions in world football, attitudes in the stands have not always kept apace with the cosmopolitanism on display on the pitch. Nor has positive leadership always come from the top. Real Zaragoza were fined just 9,000 euros ($13,800) for the abuse directed by their supporters at Eto'o. And in 2005, the Spanish national coach Luis Aragones -- currently steering Spain through Euro 2008 -- was at the center of controversy when he used a racist slur to describe French striker Thierry Henry, now a teammate of Eto'o's at Barcelona. Eto'o admits that racism is so widespread in Spain that he no longer dares take his family to matches. ""Racism can happen anywhere and I don't want them to see it,"" he told CNN. ""It's a sad situation in football. In my opinion the problem is getting bigger and the people that should come up with a solution are not doing it. So to protect my family, I don't take them to the game."" With black players regularly subjected to monkey chants in Spanish stadiums, Eto'o believes determined action is needed before verbal abuse spills over into physical violence. ""The authorities are working to find solutions. But they must find them. We can't wait until some crazy fan jumps from his seat and kills a black player before measures are taken. The players are revolted by it and we try to help each other. But the authorities must find a way to set an example."" One of the saddest aspects of racism in football is that many of those who participate in taunting colored players would never dream of behaving the same way on the street, at work or at home. But Eto'o fears attitudes in stadiums may reflect wider social attitudes which find expression amid the passion, emotion and anonymity of the football crowd . ""Football stadiums are just a reflection of what is going on in society,"" Eto'o says. ""Many times in stadiums people just feel more relaxed and say what they think when they're somewhere else."" He believes the Spanish media has a key part to play in tackling racism in football, not just by highlighting incidents of abuse but in creating an environment in which racism in the stands is no longer quietly condoned. ""I don't make the decisions, but something needs to be done. Right now, the media here pays attention to the incidents of racism, but doesn't discuss solutions. That's the tragedy. They use these images to create an impact rather than to identify racism as a problem and to urge people to find a solution. TV has a lot of weight on public opinion and what the industry must do is make people feel a social responsibility to stop this kind of behavior.""","Samuel Eto'o: ""We can't wait until some crazy fan kills a black player""

"(CNN) -- Juventus will enter the New Year as favorite to retain Serie A after it claimed a comfortable victory over Atalanta. With nearest rival Inter Milan slipping up at Lazio on Saturday, goals from Mirko Vucinic, Andrea Pirlo and Claudio Marchisio ensured Juve took full advantage. Napoli's 3-2 home defeat by Bologna means Juve is seven points clear at the summit following the weekend's action. With just one more game before the winter break, Juve is in great shape heading into the second half of the season, although manager Antonio Conte remains cautious. Klose keeps Lazio in Italian title race . ""It was a good result for us against a difficult team, but the season is far from over,"" he told reporters. ""Winning the title is never easy but through our good organisation and solid play we hope to show it's within our grasp."" It took around 90 seconds for Juve to move ahead through Vucinic, before Pirlo produced one of his trademark curling free-kicks to double the lead. Marchisio added a third with a low drive after picking up Sebastian Giovinco's pass. Atalanta's day grew even worse when it was reduced to 10 men following Thomas Manfredini's rash challenge on Giorgio Chiellini, which earned him a second booking. Magical Milan . Elsewhere, Milan continued its rich vein of form by defeating Pescara 4-1. Alberto Nocerino fired the Rossoneri ahead after just 36 seconds to register the second fastest goal in Serie A this season. An own-goal from Elvis Abbruscato doubled Milan's lead before Pescara hit back through Christian Terlizzi's header. Another own-goal, this time by Jonathas, allowed Milan to restore its two-goal lead before Stephan El Shaarawy fired home his 14th of the season.

In the English Premier League, Tottenham moved into fourth position following a narrow 1-0 victory over Swansea City. Jan Vertonghen's 75th minute goal proved enough for Spurs to claim all three points a hard-fought affair.

""We were very patient and persistent in what we were doing and kept moving the ball well. ""We held on to the win. Obviously in this season we will continue to suffer goals in the last minute because football is unpredictable, but I think today the players showed the desire and ambition to put the wrong right and we managed to hang on to the result."" There was drama in the dying stages of the contest when Swansea striker Michu was left prostrate on the turf after a collision with Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. The home side continued to play on with the Spaniard clutching his head on the turf and Swansea's players urging for the ball to be kicked out of play. Referee Mike Dean and his assistants allowed the game to continue and Swansea manager Michael Laudrup was left frustrated by the decision. He told reporters: ""I was very angry and it wasn't because it wasn't a free-kick or a red card for Lloris or a penalty or whatever, but we always talk about people, there is a debate, should we kick the ball out? ""It is the same debate in every country - we have a referee and two linesmen so we just go on until the referee blows the whistle. ""But with possible head injuries, like this one, there is no doubt, you have all the linesmen and the referee and they are connected. ""I watched it afterward on the television and when it happened, when Michu is going down to the ground the referee is watching them, the linesman is watching them and still they let the game go on, it is such a poor decision and dangerous as well.""

In Germany, defending champion Borussia Dortmund claimed a 3-1 win to move back into third place. Mario Goetze, Kevin Grosskreutz and Robert Lewandowski were all on target for Dortmund, which sits 12 points behind league leaders Bayern Munich. Goetze's stunning strike put Dortmund ahead after 20 minutes, only for Hoffenheim to draw level soon after thanks to Sven Schipplock's close-range finish. But Dortmund pushed on after the interval and Grosskreutz fired home on 58 minutes before Lewandowski sealed the win eight minutes later.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine accused of hazing a fellow Marine who later committed suicide in Afghanistan has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and a reduction in rank at a court-martial in Hawaii. Lance Cpl. Jacob D. Jacoby pleaded guilty to assaulting Lance Cpl. Harry Lew in April after Lew fell asleep while on watch after first arriving in Afghanistan. Charges also were filed against Sgt. Benjamin E. Johns and Lance Cpl. Carlos Orozco III, according to a Marine statement. They will face courts-martial later this year. ""It has been a bad tragedy for us and (we) never can be able to repair our broken heart,"" said Lew's father, Allen, to CNN affiliate KHON in Honolulu. ""We just couldn't believe their own peers could do something like that to their own people."" A military investigation report obtained by the Marine Corps Times said Lew killed himself with a two- or three-round burst from an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon in the early hours of April 3. According to the Marine Corps Times story on the report, a message found on Lew's arm, believed to be a suicide note, said: ""May hate me now, but in the long run this was the right choice I'm sorry my mom deserves the truth."" The incident at Patrol Base Gowragi, in Nawa district, began with Lew failing to respond to radio calls late on the night of April 2, the report said. A sergeant who found him sleeping told others that ""peers should correct peers,"" it said, as reported by the Marine Corps Times. The report detailed how two lance corporals, whose names were redacted, berated Lew and ordered him to do exercises in body armor for four hours, with one of them stomping on Lew's legs at times. One Marine kicked and punched Lew until being stopped by another, the report said. Less than an hour later, it said, Lew killed himself. ""At 0343 on 3 April 2011, while crouching down in the fighting position he had just dug, LCpl Lew leaned over his M249 Squad Automatic Weapon as it pointed to the sky, placed the muzzle in his mouth, pulled the trigger, and intentionally killed himself,"" the report said, according to the Marine Corps Times. The case drew national attention when Rep. Judy Chu, D-California, the aunt of the Marine who killed himself, told a congressional committee about it in September. ""Harry's death was a heartbreaking tragedy that could have been prevented,"" Chu said in October. ""The decision by the Marines Corps to bring the three Marines before a jury of their peers brings comfort to the family and shows the military justice system at work."" In her September appearance at a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Chu said her nephew's sergeant told fellow Marines in the unit to ""teach"" the 21-year-old newcomer after he was found asleep on his watch. ""Lance Corporal Lew was beaten, berated and forced to perform rigorous exercise,"" she said then. ""He was forced to do push-ups and leg lifts wearing full body armor, and sand was poured in his mouth. He was forced to dig a hole for hours. He was kicked, punched and stomped on. And it did not stop until 3:20 a.m."" In December, eight soldiers were charged in connection with the October death of another soldier in Afghanistan. Army Pvt. Danny Chen, 19, was found dead in a guard tower, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The eight officers and enlisted servicemen face various charges, including dereliction of duty, making false statements, maltreatment and involuntary manslaughter. The Army did not specify what alleged acts by the soldiers resulted in the charges, but family members said Chen had complained in letters of harassment by fellow soldiers before his death. An Army official said the soldiers are essentially charged with hazing and abusing Chen in the weeks and days before he apparently killed himself. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","The case involves the suicide of a Marine allegedly berated and beaten by peers .

"(CNN) -- In a dusty campsite in central Australia more than 30 years ago, a mother's cries of ""a dingo's got my baby"" set the stage for one of the country's most intriguing murder mysteries. The final scenes are set to be played out in court on Friday when a coroner will hear new evidence that her parents hope will once and for all confirm Azaria Chamberlain's official cause of death. ""We want a finding that Azaria was taken by a dingo,"" said Stuart Tipple, the lawyer representing Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton and her former husband Michael. ""There is a lot of new evidence. The last inquest was in 1995 and since then there have been a number of significant dingo attacks,"" Tipple said. Azaria Chamberlain was just two months old when she was snatched from a tent in August, 1980 during a family holiday to Uluru, the sacred Aboriginal site more commonly known then as Ayer's Rock. Her body has never been found. Chamberlain's claims that a dingo snatched her baby caused shock, then incredulity, before a suspicious public turned their gaze on the then 32-year-old mother-of-three. The first inquest into Azaria's death in 1981 found that the baby died as a result of being taken by a dingo, but a second the following year committed her mother to trial for murder. The 35-day hearing created a media frenzy in Australia as commentators picked apart the intricacies of the case, while a fascinated public speculated wildly as to why and how Azaria had died. ""A lot of people just never believed a dingo was capable of doing it,"" Tipple said. The jury returned its verdict in 1982; Lindy Chamberlain was found guilty of slitting her daughter's throat with a pair of scissors before hiding the body and concocting a story about a dingo to cover her crime. She was sentenced to life in jail. Her husband Michael was given a suspended sentence after being found guilty of being an accessory after the fact. The couple had two other children; two boys aged six and four at the time of Azaria's death. Chamberlain served four years of her sentence before the Northern Territory government ordered her release in 1986 after the discovery of new evidence; a baby's jacket, believed to be Azaria's, found half-buried near a dingo lair at Uluru. In 1988, a Royal Commission set up to review the evidence formally quashed convictions for both husband and wife. Despite the finding that the couple was not to blame, a third inquest into their daughter's death returned an open verdict in 1995. It is that ruling that the Chamberlains now want changed. ""Certainly, like any parent, they want closure and they're not going to be able to get closure until the record's correct,"" Tipple said. ""At the moment an open finding is not a correct finding. ""There's certainly a personal part in the journey but they want to warn people and make sure the tragedy doesn't occur again."" On Friday, he'll present the coroner with evidence of at least 12 ""very significant"" dingo attacks in Australia since the last inquest in 1995. In one of the worst cases, a nine-year-old boy was killed, and his friend mauled, by two dingoes on Fraser Island, off the coast of Queensland, in 2001. Twenty-eight dingoes were culled in the public outcry that followed. The world's largest sand island, Fraser Island earned UNESCO World Heritage status for its ""exceptional beauty"" and its rare combination of tall rainforests and towering sand dunes. It's also home to the largest population of native Australian dingoes -- around 200 animals living in up to 30 packs -- and the site of most, if not all, dingo attacks. ""On Fraser Island the dingo has a particularly difficult role because tourists are as interested in the dingo as the dingo is interested in food,"" said Professor Gisela Kaplan, a dingo expert from the University of New England in New South Wales. ""Fear, very often, is the only thing that stands between a dangerous animal and a human. Once that fear is lost any predatory animal can become dangerous,"" she said. Dingo management strategies have been introduced in areas of the country where the mammals are prevalent. Fraser Island's includes approval to cull specific animals considered to pose a threat to humans. ""Once a dingo has lost its fear of people and starts to use aggressive tactics to gain dominance over, or food from, people the habit cannot be changed,"" according to the Queensland government's campaign ""Be dingo-safe!"" It adds: ""These dingoes display aggressive or dangerous behaviour such as nipping and biting, and in some cases this escalates very quickly to attacks and serious mauling."" Tipple says that, if nothing else, the couple hope a change in the official cause of Azaria's death makes ""public authorities more aware of their responsibilties."" ""This will make them fine tune, hopefully, those plans and make them current and keep updating them,"" he said. Where once many people -- including the jury that convicted Lindy and Michael Chamberlain -- believed that it was unlikely that a dingo would kill a baby, evidence in recent years shows that it is indeed possible. However, Kaplan said public opinion had swung too far the other way, and that Australia's largest native predator had been ""demonized."" ""A dingo is a suitable animal to be demonized, isn't it? In one way you can know it, and in the other way it's mysterious,"" she said. Kaplan warned that if more wasn't done to protect the animals in their natural habitat, they would eventually die out. ""This is a very rare and endangered Australian native animal,"" she said. ""If that goes extinct, there will be outcry in future that we've allowed that to happen, because there are so many misconceptions about the animal.""","Azaria Chamberlain disappeared from a tent 31 years ago .

"(CNN) -- An Indiana lawmaker who opposes celebrating the centennial anniversary of the Girl Scouts of America says the group ""sexualizes"" young girls, promotes homosexuality and is a tactical arm of Planned Parenthood. In a letter sent to members of the Republican Caucus, Indiana state Rep. Bob Morris said many parents were ""abandoning the Girl Scouts because they promote homosexual lifestyles."" ""As members of the Indiana House of Representatives, we must be wise before we use the credibility and respect of the 'Peoples' House' to extend legitimacy to a radicalized organization,"" Morris said, warning lawmakers not ""to endorse a group that has been subverted in the name of liberal progressive politics and the destruction of traditional American family values."" In the Saturday letter, obtained by CNN affiliate WRTV-TV in Indianapolis, Morris lobbied lawmakers to oppose a nonbinding resolution celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Girl Scouts. Morris was the only member not to sign the measure. After doing what he called a ""small amount"" of research on the Internet, Morris said, he and his wife concluded the Girl Scouts have become a tactical arm of Planned Parenthood and are part of an agenda that includes ""sexualizing"" young girls. Morris' two daughters have been pulled from the Girl Scouts, he said, and instead will become active in American Heritage Girls Little Flowers organization -- a group that ""will not confuse their conservative Hoosier upbringing."" Morris said he takes the stand despite the knowledge that ""99.9% of Girl Scout troops in this country"" are run by good leaders, he told WRTV. The concern, he said, is where the money goes on the national level. In a statement, the Girl Scouts said, ""Regarding Representative Morris, if the freshman representative wishes to discredit the contributions that hundreds of thousands of Indiana women and girls have made through the Girl Scouts program over the last 100 years, then he's entitled to his opinion. ""Not only is Rep. Morris off the mark on his claims, it's also unfortunate in his limited research that he failed to discover that since 1917, every first lady has served as the honorary leader of Girl Scouts, including Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush."" Betty Cockrum, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, said she was disappointed in Morris' words, calling them ""inflammatory, misleading, woefully inaccurate and harmful."" The controversy is the latest involving Planned Parenthood and its affiliates. The Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation briefly cut funding for some Planned Parenthood projects, saying it decided it would no longer fund groups under federal investigation. Congress in September began investigating whether Planned Parenthood illegally used federal funds to provide abortions. After Komen's initial decision, Planned Parenthood said money from the foundation has largely paid for breast exams at local centers. In the past five years, it said, grants from Komen have directly supported 170,000 screenings, making up about 4% of the exams performed at Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide. Karen Handel, a vice president with the Komen Foundation, resigned her position this month following uproar over Komen's actions. In stark contrast to his colleague, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, also a Republican, handed out Girl Scout cookies on the floor of the General Assembly on Tuesday. ""There are a lot of sideshows at the General Assembly ... and all walks of life, and you just have to determine which ones you're going to go into,"" Bosma told CNN affiliate WISH-TV in Indianapolis.

"(CNN) -- In front of cameras and on the pages of widely promoted books, the wives of a few high-profile cheating husbands have been finding and broadcasting their own voices, a pronounced shift that has some who study infidelity applauding. Available in bookstores Friday is ""Staying True"" by Jenny Sanford, who filed for divorce in December from South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, whose affair with an Argentine woman was exposed by reporters after he disappeared for several days last summer. Staffers said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted he was actually in Argentina with his mistress. Sanford's published perspective is the latest addition to a small library of books written by wives betrayed by their prominent husbands. And the book arrives with perhaps the shortest time between marital shock and print. Dina Matos McGreevey was one of the first political wives to make the public about-face with the release in 2007 of ""Silent Partner: A Memoir of My Marriage."" She stood shellshocked three years earlier, by the side of her then-husband, New Jersey Gov. James McGreevey, as he stepped up to a microphone, quit the office, and came out as a ""gay American."" Elizabeth Edwards provided a glimpse into her journey with ""Resilience: Reflections on the Burdens and Gifts of Facing Life's Adversities,"" published last May and months before she and her husband, former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, eventually separated. So what happened to the women who used to stand silently by their disgraced husbands? ""While we look at these women as political wives,"" said CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley, ""some of these wives are powerful career women or have been powerful career women."" And these women have grown up in an entirely different age which gives them more choices about how to deal with an unfaithful husband, said Crowley, who now hosts CNN's ""State of the Union."" Wives can now publicly opt to let their husbands clean up their own messes. And that is one reason why former investment banker Jenny Sanford wrote her book, says publisher Ballantine Books on its Web site. ""She chose to let Mark Sanford deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character, even in the face of the lies their father has told,"" says the synopsis of her book on the site. And it's not just the marital foibles of political leaders that are seeing print. Gayle Haggard, wife of former mega-church pastor and evangelical leader Ted Haggard, recently published ""Why I Stayed,"" in which she explained how her marriage has grown stronger since her husband's infidelity was revealed. Though each woman's story is unique and their current marital statuses vary, what they seem to have in common is that they are not, like so many under-the-spotlight wives before them, staying silent. ""By speaking out they're giving the public a peek behind the curtain,"" said Ruth Houston, author of ""Is He Cheating on You? 829 Telltale Signs"" and founder of InfidelityAdvice.com. ""These wives who are telling it like it is are doing a wonderful service to others who are or may become victims of infidelity."" When Houston found out more than 16 years ago that her first husband was cheating on her, she said, she wished she'd had touchstones like these women and their books to turn to. Instead, she said, she found herself grasping for answers in bookstores where the selection was slim and the references hard to come by. ""How could this happen in a good marriage? How could it happen to me? How do I handle it,"" Houston, who's been remarried for 10 years now, remembers asking herself over and over again. ""I vowed that once I got over it, I would make it my mission to get information into the hands of people who need it most -- the infidelity victims, both men and women."" Houston has spent 16 years studying infidelity and interviewing couples. ""What started out as a fact-finding mission,"" she said, ""turned into a second career."" The key to avoiding problems, said Houston, is not assuming your marriage will be safe from infidelity and being aware of clues that there might be trouble. ""We do a breast exam every single month,"" she said, and looking out for warning signs in a pair of people is equally important. The earlier that problems, including infidelity, are caught and discussed, ""the better the chances are for survival in your relationship."" This kind of thinking was generally foreign to women of earlier generations. For seven long years, starting in the 1960s, Peggy Vaughan had suspicions about her husband. She didn't dare say a word about the feared affairs, though -- not to him or her friends. Instead, she did what she thought wives were supposed to do. She kept her worries to herself and allowed the not knowing to gnaw at and, in fact, torture her. Simply put, she said, ""That's how it was back then."" But when the truth came out in 1974, and after they fought through their feelings and emerged stronger, she and her psychologist husband, James, did something that was unheard of at the time. They wrote a book in 1980 about their experiences and agreed to talk publicly about their painful journey. Their book ""Beyond Affairs,"" which publishers initially wouldn't touch, sent them off on the TV circuit. Phil Donahue dedicated a full hour to their story. ""As long as it feels like it's too awful to talk about, it'll feel like it's too awful to get over it,"" said Vaughan, 73, author of ""The Monogamy Myth"" and host of the Extramarital Affairs Resource Center at dearpeggy.com. And talking about it, she said, made her feel empowered and her marriage work. ""The more I did it, the better I felt, the stronger I felt,"" Vaughan said. ""I was the one who owned it."" This, however, doesn't mean that the public -- so quick to condemn affairs and yet eager for details -- needs to be privy to every salacious twist and turn, Vaughan said. She said she disapproves of books such as Andrew Young's recent tell-all, ""The Politician,"" calling some of the claims he makes about John and Elizabeth Edwards ""beyond the pale."" Taking back the story may be especially important for the famous. In a time when tabloids, Internet chatter and even mainstream media will speculate wildly about famous couples, some, like authors Elizabeth Edwards and Jenny Sanford, choose to be part of the conversation and not just the topic of it.","Writing books and doing interviews, wives of famous cheating husbands speak out .

"Rome (CNN) -- Technical experts directing the salvage operation aboard the Costa Concordia cruise ship are recommending that the underwater part of the operation be called off because it is becoming too dangerous, Italy's civil protection agency said Tuesday. The head of the operation, Franco Gabrielli, will make the final decision, but is unlikely to go against the recommendations of the technical experts, his office said. The advice is based on safety concerns and follows consultations with relatives of the people still missing from the shipwreck and diplomats representing their countries, the civil protection agency said. A total of 15 people remain missing after the cruise ship's collision with rocks off the coast of Tuscany on January 13. Seventeen bodies have been recovered. There were about 4,200 people on the cruise liner when it crashed. Franco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, said that after the ship hit the rocks, he ran it aground off Giglio island to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting. It came to rest on its starboard, or right, side, with roughly 50% of the ship under water. It is currently rotated nearly 90 degrees. Salvage operations in the part of the ship above the water line will continue, Gabrielli's office said, as will searches of 7 square miles (18 square kilometers) of sea around the wreck. Underwater operations have previously been temporarily suspended for safety reasons, but have always resumed. Technical experts are now advising that they come to a permanent end. Schettino is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board. He denies the charges, saying his actions saved lives. Schettino has admitted to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge that he made a ""mistake"" in colliding with the rocks off shore. But he has brushed aside suggestions that he was going too fast, as prosecutors allege. The lead prosecutor in the case is asking that Schettino be sent back to jail. A hearing has been scheduled for February 6. But Schettino's lawyer says he should be released from house arrest. Officials are particularly concerned for divers who are searching submerged areas of the ship amid a sea of debris that includes heavy items and wires, they said Sunday. The ship jolted slightly and then slowly moved even further, totaling about 4 centimeters over a few hours, Gabrielli said Sunday. The ship's movement renewed fears that the vessel could slide farther. Earthquakes in the region last week also stoked fears that the ship could plunge deeper into the water. Gabrielli said that if the ship does not slip into deeper water, it will take at least seven to 10 months to remove the wreckage. And that process won't begin until after the fuel is removed, which could take 28 working days once it begins. In the meantime, there will be no fishing, diving, snorkeling, or other normal use of the water near the wreckage, extending the disaster's economic toll. A number of survivors have filed lawsuits against the company that ran the cruise, Costa Cruises. Costa has announced it was offering each of about 3,200 passengers who had been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ($14,400), in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress, as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise. Separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment at the scene and with the families of those who died, Costa said.","The operation is becoming too dangerous for divers, technical experts say .

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- An activist monk detained by Myanmar authorities Friday was freed hours later after being questioned at a military base in Yangon, a fellow monk said Saturday. U Gambira was taken away from a monastery in Yangon by about 10 men in plainclothes who said they were from the ""Yangon Division,"" said U Thika, a monk who witnessed the events. His detainment occurred only weeks after he was released from years of imprisonment. He was released again Friday night after being questioned at the military headquarters in Yangon about his personal and family information, according to Ashin Issariya, another monk at the Yangon monastery. The detention of U Gambira comes after the Myanmar government has taken notable steps to improve its human rights record. In recent weeks, the regime has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, approved the participation of the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party in April elections, and pledged to pursue a peace deal with an ethnic rebel group. Western governments have applauded the effort, with the United States announcing in January that it would exchange ambassadors with Myanmar for the first time since 1988. That came after a visit to the country last month by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the first top U.S. diplomat in the nation in more than five decades. U Gambira was one of the leaders of anti-government demonstrations that rallied tens of thousands of people in 2007. The Myanmar authorities cracked down on the demonstrations, clubbing and gassing protesters and arresting as many as 200 monks. He was released last month with other political prisoners. U Thika said he believed the reason U Gambira had been taken away Friday may be related to a recent effort by U Gambira to break into his old monastery, which was locked after the 2007 protests. CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","NEW: U Gambira, an activist monk, is released after being detained earlier Friday .

"(CNN) -- Pelting rains, whipping winds, mass evacuations: There is no doubt that Hurricane Sandy, by Sunday, had already made a mammoth impact on the U.S. East Coast. And it should only get worse. That's the consensus view, among forecasters and officials, as the Category 1 storm continued to chug northeastward parallel to the shore. Even with its eye still hundreds of miles away, those on the North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland coasts felt its wrath Sunday. But if, as expected, it turns toward the United States early Monday morning, Sandy will have an even more direct -- and potentially calamitous -- effect on millions. Forecasters warn it will likely collide with a cold front from the West to spawn a ""superstorm"" that could slog along the Eastern Seaboard for days -- meaning even more wind, flooding, power outages and, with that all, potential danger. ""I'm expecting it to be really bad,"" Paul DiCristina Jr. told CNN affiliate NY1, after prepping his Coney Island restaurant ahead of Sandy. ""We're evacuating, we know that for sure, but I'm just hoping there's a restaurant here Wednesday or Thursday."" He's not alone in his fears. The National Hurricane Center is warning of no less than a ""life-threatening storm surge flooding the Mid-Atlantic coast, including Long Island and New York Harbor,"" all in addition to sustained winds in excess of 70 mph and even stronger gusts -- conditions that will affect millions of people. A state-by-state breakdown of hurricane preparation efforts, impacts . ""Sandy has a tremendous amount of energy,"" U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Steven Ratti told CNN. ""It could be bad, or it could be devastation."" On Sunday alone, power was knocked out in places such as Hampton Roads, Virginia, as rough waves crashed along the coast, said Penelope Penn. Another CNN iReporter, Elizabeth Switzer, reported waves topping 12 feet further south along Carolina Beach outside Wilmington, North Carolina. And by late afternoon, floodwaters washed over roads between Dewey and Bethany beaches in Delaware, said Gov. Jack Markell, adding even more urgency for people to get out before they get trapped. ""We're seeing more flooding than you normally do, and particularly since the storm's not here,"" Markell said around 5 p.m. Sandy took a toll well before its U.S. arrival, causing at least 67 deaths -- including 51 in Haiti -- as it rumbled through the Caribbean. As of 11 p.m. Sunday, Sandy still hadn't veered toward the United States, though the National Hurricane Center said that should happen ""during the next several hours."" Centered 470 miles south-southeast of New York, the hurricane should make landfall late Monday in southern New Jersey and the Delmarva Peninsula, which includes Delaware and parts of Maryland and Virginia, according to the CNN Weather Unit. One thing that makes this storm unique is not so much its 75 mph sustained winds, but the fact such hurricane-force winds extend 175 miles out from its eye. That portends to affect hundreds of miles of territory, on both sides of Sandy's eye, hit hard by destructive winds, with an even bigger swath getting tropical force-level gusts and drenching rains. 'Superstorm' meets barnstorm as weather and politics collide . Sandy prompted evacuation orders on New Jersey's barrier islands, in downtown Ocean City, Maryland, and in flood-prone coastal communities in southern Delaware. Low-lying areas of New York City, including Coney Island and parts of Manhattan, are being cleared out as well. Jim Brady was among those who heeded the call, leaving his Cape May home about three blocks from the Atlantic and heading 85 miles north to his sister-in-law's house in Toms River. Packing what they can and stashing bigger valuables as high as possible, what happens next is now out of their hands as it may take days before they find out if they've skirted disaster. ""We'll just hunker down and wait for it to pass,"" Brady said. Many other communities, big and small, also are bracing for the worst. The process of halting subway service in New York, the city that never sleeps, began Sunday evening. Other mass transit systems are doing the same by suspending their services Monday, including Washington's Metro service and Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority trains and buses in and around Philadelphia. Across the bay from Brooklyn in Sea Bright, New Jersey, Yvette Cafaro pleaded on the plywood that covered up her burger restaurant, ""Be kind to us Sandy."" The seaside area largely dodged last year's Hurricane Irene, and Cafaro is hoping for -- but not expecting -- any more reprieves. Keep a hurricane preparation checklist . ""Everything that we've been watching on the news looks like this one will really get us,"" she said. ""We're definitely worried about it ... Hopefully, she'll spare us."" After filling his trunk with sandbags Sunday in Cranston, Rhode Island, resident Steve Pacheco said he has done what he can by clearing Halloween decorations and other items from his yard. Still, for all his preparation, he admits Sandy makes him nervous. ""I don't want to go through this again,"" Pacheco told CNN affiliate WPRI. Officials from North Carolina to Maine have been raising alarms, and taking preventive steps like the subway shut-downs, for days. By Sunday evening, officials already had canceled classes Monday for well over 2 million public school students in districts such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Baltimore, while numerous universities as well as federal government offices in Washington and government offices in states like New Jersey were preemptively closed. Sandy has even managed to put the presidential election on the back burner, turning campaign plans upside down. Then there are the travel nightmares that the storm has already, and will continue, to cause with thousands of flights called off, Amtrak train runs scuttled, and hundreds of roads and highways expected to flood. A full moon, which always brings out higher than normal tides, should exacerbate storm surge problems on Monday in coastal areas. In addition to one 12 hours earlier, high tide is scheduled for around 8:30 p.m. -- meaning parts of Delaware and New Jersey, for instance, could see significant flooding then even if Sandy has come ashore by then. Irrespective of the tides, the National Weather Service is forecasting potentially harmful storm surges of between 6 to 11 feet in New York Harbor and Long Island Sound. ""This is not a typical storm. It could very well be historic in nature and in scope and in magnitude because of the widespread anticipated power outages, flooding and potential major wind damage,"" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett said, speaking of his state but just as well about many others in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. ""Essentially, this is a hurricane wrapped in a nor'easter.""

"(CNN) -- ""Do I look like Serena? Like, come on. Seriously?"" Sloane Stephens understandably rankles at such a comparison with one of the world's greatest tennis players. ""You know, it's kind of crazy, but it's really not that bad. But when you hear it, it's like, 'Oh my god, did they just say that?' "" Only the laziest of observers could mistake the 19-year-old rising star for a Williams sister off the court. But on it, the similarities are striking. Blessed with natural athleticism and steely determination allied to a powerful serve and forehand, Stephens shares many of the attributes that have helped Venus and Serena dominate the women's game over the past 15 years. Posters of the sisters, who have won 21 grand slam singles titles between them, adorned Stephens' bedroom walls when she was growing up. ""I love them. Obviously they're like the coolest people. They are the greatest tennis players ever to me,"" she told CNN's Open Court. Venus works really hard and is a great role model for girls, she says, while Serena has become a close friend. ""We talk about everything ... anything that comes to mind. We always have good conversations and we have a lot of things to talk about. So it works out."" 2012 has been a breakthrough year in Stephens' fledgling career. She reached the second round of the Australian Open in January before making her Fed Cup debut for the U.S. alongside Serena against Ukraine in April. Promising performances followed at both Wimbledon (reaching the third round) and at Roland Garros, where she achieved her best grand slam result to date, losing to U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur in the last 16. Results away from the grand slams have also been encouraging, with semifinal appearances at WTA events in Strasbourg in May and more recently in Washington D.C. All of which has helped earn Stephens a top-50 ranking heading into the U.S. Open, where she meets Italy's Francesca Schiavone in the opening round on Tuesday. The former French Open champion and two-time quarterfinalist at Flushing Meadows beat Stephens in Strasbourg and will provide a stern examination of the young American's evolving game. ""I'm working on so many different things. Coming to the net more, being more aggressive. I'm really working on my concentration. Staying focused. That's like a big one for me,"" she said. Stephens has got a great attitude, says her coach David Nainkin, and doesn't fear the big stage. ""Sloane is a phenomenal athlete and probably has one of the best forehands in the world. She has so many options when she plays. So it's really about (improving) shot selection and channeling her power,"" Nainkin says. ""She's a great personality. She speaks very well ... she's fun to be around and she's great for tennis."" Stephens first picked up a racket when she was nine, catching the eye of coach and former men's pro, Francisco Gonzalez at the Sierra Sport & Racquet Club in Fresno, California. On his advice, her mother Sybil Smith decided to relocate the family to Florida to further Stephens' ambitions, enlisting her at the Saviano High Performance Tennis Academy in Fort Lauderdale. It was a smart move and provided the platform for a successful junior career which saw Stephens claim three consecutive junior grand slam doubles titles in 2010 at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows with Hungarian partner Timea Babos. It was also proof of her exceptional sporting genes -- her mother was a champion swimmer at Boston University while her biological father, John Stephens, who tragically died in a car crash in 2009, was a former NFL running back. Smith and Stephens divorced when Sloane was a child, and she saw little of her father while growing up. But his death, aged 43, was a painful blow and followed the loss of her stepfather to cancer two years earlier. ""When my dad died it was a really tough time, but my whole family has been super supportive. I've come out a better person and I've learned so much at a young age,"" Stephens said. It was her stepfather who got Stephens hooked on tennis in the first place, Smith told CNN. ""He was very passionate about tennis. Sloane was always watching him at the club before we moved to Florida. The two of them really had a tennis bond,"" Smith said. Today, Smith, who also has a son, Shawn, tries to keep things as normal as they can be for her daughter, treading the line between protector and liberator. ""You know, sometimes I don't travel because she really does need to feel the pressure on her own. But you keep your day-to-day routines the same and keep your family and your values the same and it works out pretty well,"" she said. Stephens' maturity bodes well for her future, says James Blake, former American No. 1 and winner of 10 titles on the men's ATP Tour. ""She seems fearless. She doesn't appear to be in awe of anything, and that's impressive at that age,"" Blake said. ""When I came on tour, I was definitely a little shook by playing Pat Rafter and Andre Agassi ... but she doesn't seem like that and that's impressive. It's going to win her some matches later."" For now though, Stephens is just looking forward to her home slam, where she reached the third round in her debut last year. ""Oh, it's crazy. It's just so many people and they all want you to win,"" she said. ""It's so nice just to be on court where everyone is cheering for you. A home slam is always really special and this year will be just as amazing as all the other ones.""","Sloane Stephens has enjoyed a successful year on the tour and is hotly tipped for success .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of militants stormed military checkpoints in northwest Pakistan early Tuesday, killing at least eight soldiers and injuring 10 others, military and government officials said -- the latest in a string of attacks against security forces. Twenty-five militants died in the clash, according to the officials. The predawn attack took place over several hours in Kurram, one of seven mostly ungoverned districts in Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. The district has seen a sharp increase in militant activity with insurgents who have fled military operations in neighboring South and North Waziristan. Kurram has become the front line in the fight between Pakistani militants and security forces. The Pakistani army has launched several operations in Kurram to flush out militants, but parts of the district remain strongholds of the Pakistan Taliban. Last week, six soldiers and 10 militants died in another battle in the same area. More than 3,000 Pakistani soldiers have been in killed in the fight against Islamist militants over the past decade, the Pakistani Army says. The number of soldiers killed this month -- more than 50 -- is very high, but doesn't approach figures in 2009 and 2010, when up to 150 troops at a time were killed in one month at the height of military operations in Pakistan's tribal region, a senior Pakistani military official said.

"(CNN) -- World leaders have paid tribute to Nobel Laureate Wangari Maathai who passed away while having treatment for ovarian cancer on Monday. Archbishop Desmond Tutu praised Maathai as a true ""visionary African woman"" and called her a ""leading voice on the continent."" He said: ""Professor Maathai introduced the idea of women planting trees in Kenya to reduce poverty and conserve the environment,"" in a statement released via his office. ""At last count, the Green Belt Movement she helped to found had assisted women to plant more than 40 million trees. She understood and acted on the inextricable links between poverty, rights and environmental sustainability. One can but marvel at her foresight and the scope of her success. She was a true African heroine,"" the statement continued. ""Our condolences go to Professor Maathai's family, to the people of Kenya, and to the countless women (and men) across Africa and the world to whom she was an inspiration."" His views were echoed by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan who said he was ""deeply saddened"" to learn of her death. ""She will be remembered as a committed champion of the environment, sustainable development, womens' rights, and democracy. Her contribution to all these causes will forever be celebrated and honored,"" he said. ""Wangari was a courageous leader. Her energy and life-long dedication to improve the lives and livelihoods of people will continue to inspire generations of young. ""Her award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004, the first to be bestowed upon an African woman, rightly underscored the important nexus in her work between sustainable development, peace and human security."" Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete was among the first world leaders to celebrate the professor's life. ""Rest in peace Dr Wangari Maathai. A great woman, an inspiration for many women across Africa, a magnificent visionary and embodiment of courage,"" President Kikwete said on Twitter. Former U.S. vice president Al Gore also paid tribute to Maathai who he said ""overcame incredible obstacles to devote her life to service—service to her children, to her constituents, to the women, and indeed all the people of Kenya-- and to the world as a whole."" In a statement, he said: ""Wangari was a warm and devoted mother and I send my condolences to her family.  She worked tirelessly both as an elected Member of Parliament and an Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources.  She forged new ground for women in Kenya helping shatter what we would call the 'glass ceiling' in the United States."" A spokesman for the Nelson Mandela Foundation said in a statement that Maathai has left a ""lasting legacy in greater awareness and work in protecting our environment and the world."" Wangari Maathai: A life in pictures . The statement praised Maathai for a speech she delivered in 2005 at the Third Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, while she was Deputy Minister of Environment in Kenya. ""We need people who love Africa so much that they want to protect her from destructive processes,"" she said in her address. ""There are simple actions we can take. Start by planting 10 trees we each need to absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale. Get involved in local initiatives and volunteer your time for services in your community,"" she continued. A spokesman for the Kenyan government said the death of Maathai was ""a huge loss to the country, Africa and the whole world"" and had left a ""gaping hole that will be difficult to fill."" He said Maathai had been receiving treatment for ovarian cancer at the Nairobi Hospital for the past year. He added: ""Prof. Wangari Maathai brought meaning to the words peace and environment. She made the world understand that water, trees, and protection of the environment helps us achieve real peace. He continued: ""She was deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize because she taught all of us the importance of respecting our planet and each other. Her passion, dedication and focus became a beacon to be emulated by millions."" Bineta Diop, Founder of Femmes Africa Solidarite, an organization working on issues of gender, peace and development, remembered Maathai as someone who risked her life for ordinary people. ""Africa has lost today one of its greatest daughters. Wangari was the champion of the environmental cause, to which she brought the attention of the Continent when nobody was talking about this great challenge. She worked tirelessly for the rural women, demanding African leaders to address climate change,"" she said. Diop said she would continue to inspire generations to come: ""We are sure that the young women and men she mentored are ready to continue her fight for climate justice."" Meanwhile, tributes flooded in on social networking sites Facebook and Twitter. Maathai was trending worldwide on the micro blogging website as people from around the world remembered how she had touched their lives. Ann Pettifor, from the New Economics Foundation tweeted: ""Wangari was my heroine. Jubilee 2000's African leader and did great work for Kenya's debt."" Another tweeter, Lorde Sirm, wrote: ""A symbol of hope, dreams in a world full of green rest in peace."" There were also calls for her to receive a state burial on Twitter with user, KGitonga, tweeting: ""We failed to honor her when it mattered. Let her rest in humility like she lived."" There were also calls on Facebook for her work to continue, one user, Catherine Gitonga wrote: ""May we honor her by planting as many trees as we can so that her legacy may live on and we may fulfill all that she fought for. Rest in peace knowing that your contribution to Kenya will forever be remembered."" On Facebook, Lorot Saleml wrote: ""I refuse to believe that Mama is dead. She lives among us.

"(CNN) -- It was an exciting day for Laura Dominguez and her 11-year-old daughter Paulina. They were summoned to their parish, the Saint Cosme and Damian Church in Mexico City to pick up the equivalent of a jackpot for Mexican Catholics: tickets to attend a mass presided by the pope in Gunajuato, about four hours from Mexico City. Dominguez, a 40-year-old Mexican Red Cross paramedic was elated. ""It's very exciting. It's incredible. I never imagined I was going to get the opportunity to attend,"" Dominguez said. Pope Benedict XVI will travel to Mexico for the first time Friday. This is also his first visit to Spanish-speaking Latin America in his seven-year pontificate. Mexico boasts the second-largest population of Catholics in the world after Brazil, a country the pope visited in 2007 (Brazil's predominant language is Portuguese). He also visited the United States in 2008. But Benedict's trip will likely be overshadowed by his deceased predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Barely a week before Benedict's arrival, an exhibit to honor John Paul opened in Mexico City. The exhibit, entitled ""John Paul II in Private,"" is at Mexico City's Palacio de los Deportes (Sports Palace). It includes 200 personal items used by John Paul throughout his life and papacy. Exhibit organizer Karla Betanzo de la Rosa says they're expecting as many as 300,000 visitors in the three months the exhibit will last. It ends June 15. Betanzo is also an admirer of the late pontiff, who first visited Mexico in 1979. ""It was such a magnetic energy that you could feel whenever he was around really. It would just transform the people when he visited,"" Betanzo said. John Paul's shoes, which are also part of the exhibit, are indeed big shoes to fill. Mexico was the first country he visited in 1979, shortly after becoming pope. He would visit four more times in 1990, 1993, 1999 and 2002, traveling to 12 of Mexico's 31 states. Mexican Catholics called the Polish pontiff ""Mexico's pope."" John Paul was an energetic 58-year-old when he first arrived in Mexico in 1979. The Rev. JosÃ© de JesÃºs Aguilar, spokesman with the Mexico City Archdiocese, says it's just a matter of time before Mexican Catholics learn to love Benedict. ""When John Paul came to Mexico for the first time nobody knew him. It was only after getting to know him that people started loving him. Therefore, we shouldn't jump to conclusions. Let us welcome Benedict to this land and show him that Mexicans are good hosts,"" Aguilar says. A survey conducted by Demotecnia, a national polling firm, found that more than three-quarters of Mexican Catholics are not excited by the visit or less excited than they were when the previous pope visited. One place the pope will not visit is Mexico City. Benedict is 85 and the city's high altitude poses a risk to the pope's health, say Vatican officials. Dominguez still treasures the previous pope's visits, including to her native Mexico City, but adds, ""There's no comparison between them; they're very different."" ""Pope John Paul loved being close to the people."" Of his decision not to visit Mexico City, Dominguez says, ""I know there's a lot of conflict right now, but we don't like the fact that he's not coming to Mexico City. But I'm sure he's a generous man as well."" There's hope for a renewal of affection in the new generation. Dominguez's daughter Paulina says she's really looking forward to the pope's mass. ""It's like watching my favorite person, a superhero."" CNN producer Nick Parker in Mexico City contributed to this story.","Pope Benedict XVI will travel to Mexico for the first time Friday .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed a controversial state DNA testing law to remain in effect until the justices have time to consider the broader constitutional questions. Maryland's DNA Collection Act permits police to collect genetic material from those who have been arrested, but not yet convicted. Chief Justice John Roberts issued the three-page in-chambers opinion, putting a state court's ruling favoring a criminal defendant on hold. ""Collecting DNA from individuals arrested for violent felonies provides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping to remove violent offenders from the general population,"" Roberts wrote. ""Crimes for which DNA evidence is implicated tend to be serious, and serious crimes cause serious injuries. That Maryland may not employ a duly enacted statute to help prevent these injuries constitutes irreparable harm."" The chief justice said there is a ""fair prospect"" the Supreme Court would ultimately find in favor of the state on the search and seizure questions. After more legal briefs are filed, the high court in coming weeks will decide whether to hear the case and issue a definitive, binding ruling. Oral arguments would likely not be held until early next year. A 1994 federal law created a national database in which local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies can compare and share information on DNA matches from convicted felons, but courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed. The current case involves a Maryland man convicted of a 2003 rape in Wicomico County in the state's eastern shore region. Alonzo King Jr. had been arrested three years ago on an unrelated assault charge, and a biological sample was automatically obtained at that time. King moved to suppress the use of the DNA on Fourth Amendment grounds, but was ultimately convicted of the first-degree rape offense. A divided Maryland Court of Appeals later agreed with King, saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon, outweighing the state's law enforcement interests. That court also said obtaining King's DNA immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him, and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting. State officials then asked the justices to intervene now, saying the state court ruling ""has resulted in the loss of a valuable crime-fighting tool relied upon by Maryland."" They said that from a law enforcement and forensic perspective, there is no difference between fingerprinting and collecting ""biometric information."" Roberts in his opinion tentatively agreed. ""The (state court) decision below has direct effects beyond Maryland: Because the DNA samples Maryland collects may otherwise be eligible for the FBI's national DNA database, the decision renders the database less effective for other states and the federal government,"" Roberts wrote. The state DNA collection law in Maryland is set to expire at the end of next year, but the justices are likely to decide its constitutionality before then. The case is Maryland v. King (12A48).","Maryland's law allows police to collect genetic material from those arrested .

"(CNN) -- In keeping with their vow to prevent any more of President Barack Obama's appeals court nominees from being confirmed until after the election, Senate Republicans successfully upheld Monday their filibuster of Judge Robert Bacharach's nomination to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in Denver. The filibuster came despite praise for Bacharach from the two GOP senators from Oklahoma, where he is currently a federal magistrate judge, and the support of three centrist Republicans who voted across the aisle. The vote was 56-34, several votes short of the 60 the Democrats needed to break the filibuster. Each Oklahoma senator, torn between their support for the nominee and their desire not to undermine their Senate leadership, voted present. Zelizer: Why are tax increases radioactive? In upholding the filibuster, Republicans invoked what is known as the Thurmond Rule, named after late South Carolina Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond, a former longtime Judiciary Committee member. The informal rule, which has been practiced by both parties for decades, justifies the blocking of a president's pick for an appeals court judge months before a presidential election. ""The rationale has been that this close to an election, whoever wins that election should be the one to pick these lifetime nominees who will run our judiciary system,"" explained Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Republican leaders signaled last month they soon would block appointments to the powerful circuit courts, which are one level below the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats said they had hoped to get Bacharach through before the rule took affect and argued that never before had a circuit court judge who was voted out of the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support been filibustered. Republicans disputed that point. Tax vote is more about November vote . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called Bacharach ""well-qualified"" and lamented that the pattern of GOP filibusters would now extend to circuit court judges. ""Why should we be surprised, though?"" Reid said on the floor. ""We've already had 85 filibusters, so just add another one to it."" Grassley said that Democrats have used the Thurmond Rule in the past just as Republicans are now. In fact, Republicans call it the Leahy-Thurmond Rule, because they said the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, has invoked the rule before. ""Now they don't want us to play by the same set of rules,"" Grassley said. ""The Democratic leadership doesn't want us to enforce the rules that they helped establish."" Democrats won't touch gun control . In addition, Grassley argued Reid knew Bacharach would be filibustered and put his nomination up for a vote anyway in an effort to paint Republicans as obstructionist. Republican Sens. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine, voted to end the filibuster. Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, a longtime Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, voted present.","Senate Republicans have vowed to filibuster Obama's nominees until after the election .

"(CNN)  -- She had come alone to the Richmond High School homecoming dance, gorgeous in a sparkling purple dress and faux diamond baubles. The DJ played salsa, meringue, rap. When the teenager disappeared, her friends thought she had gone home early. Except she never said goodbye. ""We were going to go look for her,"" said Kami Baker, 16, a junior at the school. The next day, Baker learned the ugly truth about what had happened to her friend. According to police, she had been gang raped and beaten for almost 2½ hours and left unconscious under a bench shortly before midnight Saturday night. ""I busted up crying,"" Baker said. The campus incident in the Bay Area city north of Oakland has shaken students and their families. Baker was one of many people connected to the school and the community who lashed out at officials at a public safety hearing Wednesday. Baker blamed school district officials for not doing enough to protect her school -- and her friend. She said none of the four officers who were at the homecoming dance was patrolling the school premises even though there were a dozen young men hanging out just a few feet from the gym entrance. She says school officials chose not to take any action. ""I looked outside of the gym and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs,"" Baker said at the hearing. ""The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no ... checking either. The assistant principal looked outside and actually saw those men, and did nothing about it."" Baker took the podium with her younger sister, Barbie, a freshman at the school, who had spent a chunk of Saturday evening with the rape victim. ""This story has disrupted the school's morale greatly, including my own. I am friends with the girl,"" Baker said. ""When I started here, I felt extremely unsafe and so did she, due to the lack of police officers and security officers."" Baker later described the 15-year-old girl as a churchgoer who struggled to fit in at Richmond High. Four teenagers were arraigned Thursday on charges connected to the incident. Cody Ray Smith, described by the court as over 14 years old, pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force. Two other juveniles, Ari Abdallah Morales and Marcelles James Peter, appeared together with Smith at the Contra Costa County Superior Court, but did not enter a plea. The court described Morales as under 16, and did not give an age for Peter. All three juveniles, who wore bulletproof vests at the hearing, were charged as adults. A fourth individual, Manuel Ortega, 19, appeared separately without an attorney and did not enter a plea. He did not wear a protective vest. Another adult who was arrested has a different court date. As many as 10 people were involved in the assault in a dimly lit back alley at the school, police have said. Another 10 people watched, without calling 911, police said. The victim was released from a hospital Wednesday, police said.","NEW: Cody Smith, Ari Morales, Marcelles Peter, Manuel Ortega appear in court .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Raja Pervez Ashraf ascended to prime minister of Pakistan on Friday after lawmakers approved his nomination in a majority vote in parliament. Ashraf, 61, a former minister and staunch loyalist of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, replaces Yousuf Raza Gilani, who was ousted by a Supreme Court ruling earlier in the week. The lower house of parliament voted 211-89 in favor of Ashraf, a confidant of President Asif Ali Zardari who until recently served as minister of information and technology. Ashraf takes over running Pakistan's government at a time when political tensions are high and relations with the United States are strained. Ashraf was the party's second choice to replace Gilani. Minister Makhdoom Shahabuddin's candidacy was marred shortly after it was made public when a trial court issued an arrest warrant for him in connection with a drug scandal in 2010, when he served as health minister. Last year, Shahabuddin resigned from the minister post amid allegations that he accepted kickbacks while in office. The Supreme Court is hearing a case involving the allegations. Ashraf also has been accused of corruption in the past. In 2011, he was accused of scheming to receive kickbacks from private power companies during his time as minister of water and power. The corruption allegations earned him the nickname ""Raja Rental"" among many Pakistanis. The case was also heard by the Supreme Court and a ruling is pending, said Fawad Chaudhry, a senior leader of the Pakistan People's Party. Chaudhry called the investigation ""politically motivated."" Gilani was ousted from office when the nation's top court disqualified him retroactive to April 26, the day he was convicted of contempt charges. The charges stemmed from his refusal to call on Swiss authorities to reopen old corruption charges against Zardari. Journalists Nasir Habib and Ayza Omar contributed to this report.","NEW: Parliament elects Raja Pervez Ashraf as Pakistan's new prime minister .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A lost interview of Martin Luther King Jr. recorded more than five decades ago, but recently found in a Tennessee attic, will soon be heard in the last room where the civil rights leader slept. Illusionist David Copperfield purchased the reel-to-reel tape Wednesday and will donate it to the National Civil Rights Museum, which is housed in the Lorraine Motel. King was shot to death standing on a balcony of the Memphis, Tennessee, motel on April 4, 1968. ""It gave me chills,"" Copperfield told CNN Wednesday in a phone interview, explaining why he bought the tape for an undisclosed amount. It was striking because the recording revealed King in a relaxed mood, Copperfield said. ""We've heard Dr. King talk about peaceful change in the public forum, but this is an audio tape of him talking conversationally,"" he said. ""I'm certainly no expert, but it's the first time I've ever heard him in that context and I was very moved by it."" Copperfield said he wanted to give the recording to the museum because it ""is just the right thing to do."" ""He's certainly one of the great inspirational figures in history,"" Copperfield said. ""So much of what I do, in my own little way, is making people dream, transporting them, making them think differently. That's what magic does. His dream was far greater than any entertainer can provide."" Keya Morgan, a collector and expert on rare historical artifacts, authenticated the reel and appraised it at $100,000 last month. ""When I heard it, I got goose bumps all over,"" Morgan said, ""It feels like he's sitting in your living room and talking to you."" The museum will put the recording on exhibit in the motel room where King stayed his last nights in Memphis, Morgan said. Barbara Andrews, the museum's director of education and interpretation, confirmed the donation and said museum officials ""look forward to its receipt and sharing it with our (150,000)-plus visitors."" ""We are extremely grateful for the generosity and high regard Mr. Copperfield holds for the National Civil Rights Museum,"" Andrews told CNN. Morgan arranged the sale by Stephon Tull, who found it in a dusty old attic in Chattanooga, Tennessee, while rummaging through dilapidated boxes left there by his father many years before. In one of the battered boxes was an audio reel marked, ""Dr. King interview, Dec. 21, 1960."" Tull realized it was his father interviewing King about nonviolence and the civil rights movement. Tull's father had grown up in Tennessee during the years of racial tension, oppression, and the so-called ""Jim Crow"" segregation laws. ""He planned on writing a book on how bad things were back in that era,"" said Tull, but his father never finished the book. ""He fell ill, and is now in hospice care."" Tull's father's recorded his conversation with King three years before the civil rights leader delivered his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, four years before President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law and eight years before King was assassinated in Memphis, across the state from where Tull's father lived. In the interview, King can clearly be heard discussing his definition of nonviolence, and its importance in the civil rights movement. ""I would ... say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end through moral means,"" he said, ""and it grows out of the whole concept of love, because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving spirit, he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves the opponent."" King continued, ""I am convinced that when the history books are written in future years, historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our heritage,"" he said. ""It represents struggle on the highest level of dignity and discipline."" The Rev. Joseph Lowery, one of the founders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King in 1957, said the tapes are a reminder of the work King started that is not finished. ""One of the things that occurred back then, we effectively communicated that nonviolence as a tactic, as a technique, was very effective for civil rights protests,"" said Lowery. ""What we failed to do was express it's not just a tactic, but a way of life."" Lowery went on, ""We're losing the battle of violence versus nonviolence as a means of resolving human conflict,"" he said, ""I hope Dr. King's message, wherever it shows up will help us in the struggle."" In another part of Tull's recording, King describes a recent trip to Africa. He explains to Tull's father the importance of the civil rights movement both in the United States and abroad. ""There is quite a bit of interest and concern in Africa for the situation in the United States. African leaders in general, and African people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and familiar with what has taken place,"" he said, ""We must solve this problem of racial injustice if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world, and if we expect to maintain a moral voice in a world that is two thirds color."" The recording is intriguing to Clayborne Carson, a professor of history and founding director of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. ""It's hard to know what we're dealing with,"" he said, ""There are thousands of interviews with Dr. King, and it's hard to tell the historical significance of this (one)."" ""What is interesting about this is rather than just a transcript, you can hear his voice,"" he added. In 1985, King's widow, the late Coretta Scott King, invited Carson to direct a long-term project to edit and publish the civil rights leader's works. Based on the dates, Carson believes the African trip King mentioned in the recording was his trip to Nigeria. This is what Carson and his colleagues are most interested in. ""The trip to Nigeria is something we don't have a lot of information about,"" he said, ""In Nigeria he didn't do press conferences, didn't do interviews or write letters we know of."" CNN's Joe Sutton and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","Illusionist David Copperfield will donate the tape to the National Civil Rights Museum .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq and the United States are close to reaching a deal under which U.S. combat troops would leave by December 2010 and the rest would leave by the end of 2011, two Iraqi officials said Thursday. U.S. soldiers patrol a street in Baghdad, Iraq, last week. One of the officials, Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Haj Mahmoud, said the two governments probably will reach a final deal within days. He and Haider Al-Ababdi, a Shiite parliament member from Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Dawa Party, said that under the deal, U.S. troops would be restricted to their bases by June 30 instead of patrolling Iraq's streets. Mahmoud, the head of Iraq's delegation negotiating a deal on how U.S. troops will operate there, also said the Iraqi government would be able to request that some troops stay longer. Two senior U.S. officials said negotiators have made progress and are close to a deal. But they also said that some issues are unresolved and that troop withdrawals would be tied to conditions on the ground.  Watch what hurdles remain before a troop withdrawal » . The U.S. military presence is spelled out by a U.N. mandate, which is to expire by the end of this year. Iraq and the United States want to replace that mandate with a status-of-forces agreement governing how U.S. troops will operate in Iraq. The U.S. officials said U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke with al-Maliki on Wednesday to try to resolve the issue of legal immunity for U.S. contractors working in Iraq. The officials described the phone call as tense. Under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, security contractors have had immunity from Iraqi law. The Iraqi government has criticized the blanket immunity because of incidents such as the fatal shootings of 17 people in Baghdad's Nusoor Square on September 16. Iraqi officials say Blackwater Worldwide contractors killed the 17. Sunni politician killed . Also Thursday, a senior member of a Sunni political party that recently rejoined Iraq's government was fatally shot in the northern city of Mosul, the party said. Gunmen assassinated Mahmoud Younis Fathi, a senior member of the Iraqi Islamic Party in Nineveh province and the director of religious schools for the Sunni Endowment, the party said. Fathi's bodyguard also was killed as the pair traveled to work. Mosul police confirmed the slayings near Fathi's house in the western part of the city. Sunni insurgents have targeted Sunnis who cooperate with the U.S.-backed Iraqi government. American and Iraqi troops have been fighting al Qaeda in Iraq in Mosul and surrounding Nineveh province in northern Iraq. The Iraqi Islamic Party is the largest party in the Iraqi Accord Front bloc, which recently rejoined Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government after bolting last year over disagreements with the leadership. The Accord bloc -- which includes 44 lawmakers in the 275-member parliament -- pulled six ministers from the Cabinet last summer for several reasons, including what it called the monopolization of power by Shiites and Kurds and what it regarded as the unjust detention of Sunnis. But Sunnis have been more friendly toward the al-Maliki government because of its efforts this year in promoting prisoner amnesty, sharing power and taking on militants in Shiite regions such as Basra, Amara and Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood. The leader of the Iraqi Islamic Party is Tariq al-Hashimi, one of Iraq's two vice presidents. ""The assassination of Mahmoud Younis Fathi is a cruel crime targeting the national voices and mission of taking care of youths in Mosul,"" the Iraqi Islamic Party said, adding that it ""condemns and denounces"" the killing. In other violence Thursday in Mosul, insurgents killed three police and wounded six people by rigging a cart with explosives. About 8 p.m. Thursday, a suicide bomber's car exploded after Iraqi police shot at it, an Interior Ministry official said. The explosion happened before the car reached a police station in al-Wahda neighborhood in southern Mosul, but eight policemen were wounded, the official said. In another restive area of northern Iraq, Salaheddin province, a roadside bombing critically wounded a police chief, authorities said. Gen. Hamed Namis al-Jabouri, police commander in Salaheddin, and seven other police officers were wounded when the bomb struck a convoy, police in Tikrit said. They were evacuated to a military hospital in Tikrit. Meanwhile, the U.S. military said coalition troops in Iraq detained 25 people in raids targeting al Qaeda in Iraq militants. The raids took place in Baghdad, Salman Pak, Mosul, Bi'aj and Baiji. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Arwa Damon in Baghdad and Elise Labott in Washington contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. officials: Rice, al-Maliki have tense discussion on contractor immunity .

"(CNN) -- Was 1962 the year classic, post-'50s rock was hatched? Let's make that case. Fifty years ago, the Beatles recorded their first session at London's EMI (later Abbey Road) studios, cutting an early version of ""Love Me Do,"" and Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys released their first albums. And it was exactly 50 years ago that the first incarnation of the Rolling Stones -- Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Brian Jones, along with pianist Ian Stewart, bassist Dick Taylor and drummer Tony Chapman -- played their first concert, at London's Marquee Club. The band was still so embryonic that they called themselves the Rollin' Stones. Of course, being reminded that the Stones have been around for five decades is almost unnecessary. The band hasn't had a Top 10 hit in over 20 years, but whether we want it to or not, it never seems to have gone away. From Keith Richards' garrulous best-selling 2010 memoir, to Maroon 5's ""Moves Like Jagger,"" to Jagger himself hosting ""Saturday Night Live"" this year, the culture always seems to circle around to the Stones just when you'd think we'd all had enough of them. Part of that is intentional: To some degree, the Stones have always been driven to be competitive in the pop marketplace. ""Absolutely,"" Richards told me in an interview in 1997. ""It gets in the blood, man. Arrogant, elitist sons of bitches that we are, we still think we're getting better."" But part of their eternal appeal is out of their hands, too. Why do we still care about the Stones after a mind-boggling 50 years? A few possible reasons: . Their songs and catalog. As obvious as it is to say, it really is about the music. There's a reason pop church lady Susan Boyle could cover ""Wild Horses"" or that ""Saturday Night Live"" could send off Kristen Wiig with ""Ruby Tuesday"" and ""She's a Rainbow"": The best Stones songs, meaning ones written before roughly 1980, are eternal and built on impeccable melodies. For all their bad-boy images, Jagger and Richards seem, in retrospect, like one of the last of the great songwriting teams -- Lerner and Loewe, or Bacharach and David, with more groupies and pharmaceuticals. Even work that seemed lesser at the time -- 1973's beautiful stupor, ""Goats Head Soup,"" for instance -- holds up better than you'd expect. The way the Stones continually paid homage to black music -- from covering Muddy Waters and Solomon Burke to a disco-era hit like ""Miss You"" -- also gave them a broader fan base than many of their peers. The Mick and Keith dynamic. Little in old or new rock comes close to the testy yin-yang relationship between the band's two founding members and longtime Rock 'Em Sock 'Em duo. Over the years, they've publicly sniped at each other, culminating in Richards' dishy depictions of Jagger as a preening diva in his memoir, ""Life."" See never-before-seen photos of the Stones . Those comments -- and the way much of the media used Richards' words to pile on Jagger themselves -- missed the point, though. What always made the Stones so magnificent was the way Richards' crusty musical conservatism was balanced by Jagger's pop-chart-driven opportunism, and vice versa. They need each other, and in so doing, they've become their own endlessly watchable rock 'n' roll reality show. Stones as metaphor. The Stones embody a time when rock 'n' roll wasn't just ""outlaw"" culture; it propelled the culture. That's no longer the case, as a recent conversation with a teenage music fan confirmed to me. An avid pop lover, she doesn't listen to any ""rock"" (that is, music made by men or women who play guitars). For her, EDM -- which used to be called techno or electronica -- is the new rock; Its big beats, drug allusions, and the way its bombastic thump offends anyone over 40 (or anyone who prefers traditional verse-chorus pop songs) make it the modern-day version of rock. Factor in pop, hip-hop, and country, all major genres these days, and you can see how rock is now one small slice of the cultural pie. For many, the Stones are a vivid, last-gasp reminder of a time when rock -- and white males -- dominated the landscape. They don't make rock stars like that anymore. With a few glorious exceptions, like Jack White, many of today's major rock bands are charisma-challenged or nondescript. Onstage, they're uptight. almost asexual. Contrast that with the sight of Jagger at least year's Grammy Awards, working the stage in best rock-preacher mode and singing Solomon Burke R&B classics in a green suit. The performance should have been hokey, but it was shockingly spellbinding after all these years. Maroon 5's Adam Levine can't move like that, either. Rolling Stones celebrate 50 years of raucous rock'n'roll . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Browne.","David Browne: Rolling Stones haven't had top hit in 20 years, yet they are enduring presence .
He says the band has been willing to shape-shift to compete in pop marketplace .
He says Jagger, Richards great songwriting team with tense, compelling personal dynamic .

"SANTA BARBARA, California (CNN) -- Berkeley Breathed answers the door to his Santa Barbara home, a tall, slender figure in suede cowboy boots. Berkeley Breathed has left comic strips behind to focus on his writing -- particularly children's books. But before he can extend a hand in greeting, he's nudged aside by a canine companion eager to introduce herself. ""Pickles"" offers a hearty welcome, vigorously shaking a tail that seems powerful enough to whack a lamp from an end table. The pit bull is one of a number of dogs that Breathed and his wife, Jody, have rescued over the years. His affection and concern for dogs form the heart of ""Flawed Dogs: The Shocking Raid on Westminster"" (Philomel Books), Breathed's new illustrated novel, whose hero is a resilient dachshund with a soup ladle for a leg.  Gallery: The art of Berkeley Breathed » . It's the latest children's work from Breathed, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist behind ""Bloom County"" and ""Opus,"" who's had great success with the genre. The earlier ""Mars Needs Moms!"" is set to be made into a movie produced by Robert Zemeckis. Breathed invited CNN to his mountainside home for a rare interview, which touched on topics ranging from his book to Michael Vick, Charles Schulz and his famous pen pal, Harper Lee.  Watch Breathed read from ""Flawed Dogs"" » . The following is an edited version of the conversation: . CNN: The hero of your book is quite an unusual dog. Berkeley Breathed: Sam the Lion he's called, by Heidi [the girl] who finds him. ... The central part of the story is the fall of Sam from Heidi's life and into the depths of horrors that dogs can sometimes experience in our world -- everything from being shot at, to research labs, to the worst dog shelters amongst the world of otherwise nice dog shelters, and he comes for revenge upon Cassius [a rival]. And Cassius is going to appear at the Westminster Dog Show coming up, so Sam has got to find a team of commandos to help him infiltrate and destroy the Westminster Dog Show. CNN: What was the inspiration for the story? Breathed: The book happened because I came across both a picture and a quote at about the same time -- a picture of one of Michael Vick's fight dogs. It was set to be put down, but a shelter in Utah decided to take the dog and a few others at the same time and try to rehabilitate them. ... This was the first time the dog had ever received any affection in its life. ... It's the most moving picture of a dog I've ever seen, having gone through an impossible transition and fallen back to where dogs naturally go, which is just loving people. CNN: ""Flawed Dogs"" is put out by the ""young readers"" division of the publisher. Breathed: I notice it's getting a little bit of controversy in that people are coming to it assuming that it's for the same audience that my picture books are for. And ""Flawed Dogs"" the novel is definitely not. It's perfect for an 8-year-old, 9, 10, 11, 12, but I wouldn't read this in the evening to my 5-year-old. And there is a difference. ... It's revealed an issue that I'm surprised about, which is the new preciousness that's been brought to literature for children now. There is an abject fear of instilling any sort of dramatic trauma, of sadness, on the children who are receiving a story. ... And of course that was never a great concern in the past. The great children's stories that we all grew up with, there are always moments of great tragedy and moving moments of loss in the book that we weren't afraid of -- as long as you bring them [young readers] back by the end and bring them to where a reader should be, a child should be. CNN: You don't do a daily or a weekly comic strip anymore. How has that transition been? Breathed: If this was still 1985 and everything that means ... it would still be deeply appealing to be a cartoonist. But not now. I'm happy to leave that behind. The level of political rancor -- powered and driven by Web comment and cable news to a degree -- affects me like everybody else, and I get angry and I get annoyed and I get frustrated and that always translates into mediocre cartoons historically. ... I was getting too angry the last couple of years of cartooning, and it doesn't do the art any good. I'm very happy to let that go. CNN: When did you first discover, ""Wow, I can actually draw""? Breathed: I could never really draw something. It was, ""Wow, I can actually draw or write something that amuses somebody."" And that was a dawning that didn't happen until college. ... The greatest cartoonists ever have really been very mediocre artists. Charles Schulz was always quick to admit that his skills in artistry were limited at best. And in his case it served the strip perfectly. If ""Peanuts"" had been drawn with the artistry of ""Pogo"" and a Disney animator, it wouldn't have worked. CNN: Animals were an integral part of your comic strips. Breathed: I knew that I wanted a strip with people but the focus on an animal, and an incongruous animal. ... So I looked around largely at an animal that hadn't been done before in comic strips, an animal that is generally attractive to people and people feel immediately warm to and that just would be funny. You end up with a penguin pretty fast. Plus, he's already standing, and he's kind of got clothes on. CNN: Who are your heroes? Breathed: ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was a huge influence on my work. Harper Lee and I have over the years exchanged letters, which has been a massive delight. I can tell you that when I announced the end of my comic-stripping career and that Opus [the penguin] was not only going to fade away but fade away permanently, I got a letter from Harper urging me to reconsider letting Opus go away forever. I should have written back and said, ""The moment you bring Scout back, I'll bring Opus back. Is that a deal, Harper?"" Of all the people who should not be chastising me about stopping my career early, it would be Harper Lee. Opus really is a bit like Scout in that he's circulating around in his world, and he's surrounded by a lot of insanity, a lot of hatred, a lot of intolerance and ... he's the ultimate innocent at the center of it. And that's how Scout worked in that story. I suppose I needed an Atticus Finch for Opus, but I never had time to develop one. ... I'm not an artist who is trying to be a novelist. I've always been a writer and the art was the way to sell the writing and it's been convenient in that way. ... I'd be happy to leave that all and just be a writer if I could get away with it. I don't think I can at this point. They [readers] expect the pictures. I'm happy to oblige.","Berkeley Breathed's new book, ""Flawed Dogs,"" inspired by photo of abused dog .

"(CNN) -- The fairy tale of a cancer survivor from Austin, Texas, who beat the odds to win the Tour de France a record seven times, has morphed into a parable about telling a lie. Lance Armstrong has been revealing in his two-part exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey Thursday and Friday night, but critics say he is leaving out important details. There has been a lot to learn from Armstrong and from those watching him as he starts to tell the truth. Getting caught is just the beginning. This is the reason for his confession. After retiring from the Tour in 2005, he made a comeback in 2009. ""We wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't come back,"" Armstrong told Winfrey. Cycling colleague Floyd Landis went public in 2010 with his own doping and leveled allegations at Armstrong as well. This eventually led to investigations against Armstrong. Alternative steps for redemption . The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which tests Olympic athletes for performance enhancing drugs, praised his televised interview as a ""small step in the right direction."" But it still would like a full confession of all of his doping activities, under oath at the USADA. The agency had started an investigation against Armstrong, who sued to try to stop it. He told Winfrey he wishes he'd cooperated freely back then, but now that he has a second invitation to do so, he is approaching it with a caveat. Armstrong said he would participate if the agency forms a broad ""truth and reconciliation commission,"" involving doping across the sport of cycling. Blaming yourself is not the same as telling it all. ""I deserve this,"" were his comments on his fall from grace to public disgrace. In the interview he disparaged his own character for hours, calling himself ""deeply flawed,"" ""ruthless"" and ""arrogant."" ""I was a bully,"" he told Winfrey of how he treated others who might expose his doping and lies. 'I want to compete again' Armstrong admitted to personal guilt but was careful not to implicate others. Things escalated to the level they did ""because of my actions and because of my words, and because of my attitude and my defiance,"" he said. But he also blamed the culture of cycling during the time he doped, saying the practice was widespread and just as much ""part of the job"" as water bottles and tire pumps. There were also allegations he still denies, like coercing teammates to dope as well. People will believe a lie. Armstrong cheated for years, and no one in the sport of cycling stopped him. He lied under oath about his use of performance enhancing drugs. ""Hundreds of millions,"" as Armstrong has put it, believed him, adored him, and many wore yellow bracelets, because he inspired them. Source: Federal probe unlikely to reignite . The fairy tale image was ""one big lie that I repeated a lot of times,"" Armstrong said. It became impossible to live up to and it fell apart. He publicly derided those trying to expose him, ruining some of their lives. ""We sued so many people,"" Armstrong told Winfrey -- people who were telling the truth and lost to him in court in spite of it. It was about controlling the narrative of his heroic story. ""If I didn't like what somebody said ... I tried to control that and said that's a lie; they're liars,"" Armstrong said. ""Now the story is so bad and so toxic, and a lot of it is true,"" he said. Be nice to people on your way up. You may meet them on your way down. Lance has. And now the tables have turned. Why we cheat . ""This was a guy who used to be my friend, who decimated me,"" said Betsy Andreu, the wife of one of Armstrong's former teammates, who went public with doping allegations against Armstrong. Andreu, author Daniel Coyle, journalist David Walsh, whom Armstrong attacked for writing about his doping for over a decade, former teammates and others he has discredited and sued have now gained plausibility. They are already critiquing his confession and casting doubt on its completeness. Andreu and Coyle have called Armstrong out over his denial of allegations that he coerced teammates to use performance enhancing drugs. It's hard to regain trust. Armstrong's lies and bullying rattled his fans, former friends and teammates, even his own children. ""I will spend the rest of my life ... trying to earn back trust and apologize to people,"" Armstrong told Winfrey. Sunday Times journalist Walsh believes the cyclist's bullying was worse than his lies and left behind deeper scars. Cancer survivors' mixed feelings . ""He never showed any compassion during his years or any sense that it troubled him to destroy other people,"" Walsh said. Armstrong said he had been ruthless because he ""expected to get whatever he wanted and to control every outcome."" ""There will be people who hear this and never forgive me,"" he said. ""I understand that."" The emotional damage to his children seemed to touch him the most. Appearing to hold back tears, Armstrong said he confessed to the three oldest children over the recent holiday break. ""The older kids need to not be living with this issue in their lives,"" the athlete said. ""It isn't fair."" Speaking specifically about his 13-year-old son, whom he had heard defending him, Armstrong said he told the youth: ""Don't defend me anymore."" Hindsight is 20/20. The former Tour de France icon said he did not think there was anything wrong with what he was doing at the time he did it -- something he today finds ""scary."" That he didn't feel guilty was in retrospect ""even scarier."" That he did not think it was cheating is the ""scariest"" part. ""I viewed it as a level playing field,"" he said, where most everybody doped. Livestrong likely to survive . Armstrong also does not believe he could have won cycling's most prestigious race seven times in a row without performance enhancing drugs. And his success was not synonymous with contentment. ""That wasn't the happiest time of my life,"" Armstrong said of his championship years. He told Winfrey he felt happier giving her his confession. But his doping and bullying years also weren't the worst in his life, he said. The time of his cancer diagnosis was worse. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. Armstrong would like to compete again but has no interest in returning to the Tour de France. He'd like to be able to run in the Chicago Marathon when he's 50, but the punishment he's been slapped with won't allow it. ""I can't run the Austin 10K,"" he said. ""Anything that is sanctioned"" by an official governing body is ruled out. ""This may not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it (being allowed to compete), maybe not right now,"" Armstrong said. A six-month suspension is customary for doping he said, but he received a ""death penalty."" Now that he has been caught and has confessed, lawsuits he won could be reviewed, and his victims could come after him, tearing away at his fortune. But the nadir, Armstrong says, was his departure from his cancer awareness charity Livestrong, which distributed the iconic plastic yellow bracelets. It happened in two phone calls. They first asked him to resign as chairman of the board. The second call was less to the point. ""We need you to consider stepping down for yourself,"" Armstrong said he was told. He got out of the way and hopes the charity, which was built on his debunked fairy tale legacy, can carry on without him. ""It hurt like hell,"" Armstrong said. ""That was the lowest."" Armstrong's golden halo in the sport's annals has decayed to a black mark. No other cyclist was awarded the victories he was disqualified from. In place of a record seven wins by Lance Armstrong, the chronicles of the Tour de France bear seven record vacancies. No one won. Cycling, facing an uphill climb, hopes next hero just around bend .","The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency still wants an official confession under oath .
Armstrong destroyed people on the way up, who are waiting for him on the way down .
The cyclist cheated for years, but nobody stopped him .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In a congratulatory letter to president-elect Barack Obama, French President Nicholas Sarkozy writes, ""Your election raises in France, in Europe, and beyond throughout the world, immense hope."" President-elect Barack Obama faces a litany of foreign policy problems when he takes office January 20. Similar statements from dozens of world leaders and images of people around the world celebrating his election make clear Barack Obama will enjoy a good deal of international goodwill when he takes office on January 20. Obama's election offers a monumental transformation of America's face to the world. Many see him as the epitome of the American dream. But his appeal is not solely based on the fact that he is black or that his middle name is Hussein or that his father was Kenyan or that he spent part of his childhood in Indonesia. The global excitement over Obama's election is as much about the fact that he isn't President Bush. In his victory speech Tuesday night, Obama said, ""To all those watching from beyond our shores, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.''  Watch CNN's Zain Verjee report on the world's reaction to Obama's election » . Those were welcome words to those who resented what they viewed as eight years of ""unilateralist"" Bush policies. His words spark hope that an Obama administration will repair America's relations with the rest of the world. But as high as those hopes are, so too are the sky-high expectations. The world has been seduced by Obama's vision of change. But will ""Obamamania"" survive the realities of governing? It is difficult to think of a U.S. president who has come to power with a more complex and pressing web of domestic and international burdens. He inherits a global financial meltdown, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a global struggle against terrorism, and a military already stretched to its limits. Add to that, a simmering crisis with Iran, renewed tensions with Russia, and the rise of China as a global economic powerhouse, and Obama's plate starts to get pretty full. Obama also takes the reins at a time of enormous anti-American sentiment after the stains of Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and, closer to home, Hurricane Katrina. U.S. power is declining, and not entirely by fault of its own. The concept of a single-superpower world no longer fits. Developing countries like China, Brazil and India, coupled with a stronger European Union belong to a new world where many players call the shots. Globalization requires more cooperation with a wider range of countries and organizations. Obama's speech in Europe this summer about the need for reconciliation, signaled he wants to strengthen ties with Europe damaged during the Bush administration, especially over Iraq. His pledge to withdraw from Iraq and his promise for strong action on climate change is bound to make European allies happy. But issues like trade and increased troops for Afghanistan could spark new differences with Europe. Obama has pledged to make Middle East peace a priority from Day One. Arabs are already calling for a more even-handed approach, while Israel is expecting Obama to stay true to the pro-Israel posture he showed during the campaign. And there are other complications -- like politics on the ground. Israeli elections early next year could bring hawkish former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back to power. And if moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is unable to win support from Hamas next year to extend his term, his re-election is far from certain. Obama has promised to engage Iran's leaders on a multitude of issues, but it remains to be seen if Iran would accept any deal to give up its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Obama could be forced into a devil's choice between military action (or supporting an Israeli strike) and living with a nuclear Iran. There is a long list of other pressing issues. Obama is likely to continue the Bush administration's policy of going after extremists in Pakistan. And in Africa, conflicts in Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to churn. This is by no means an exhaustive list. Countries around the world will compete for Obama's attention. Africa, elated over the election of America's first black president, may expect increased attention and aid from the United States. Additionally, Muslims familiar with Obama's Kenyan father and middle name, ""Hussein,"" may think he will be more understanding of their concerns. Will he embrace them or distance himself from them, in an effort to prove he does not hold any bias? The president-elect must navigate this minefield of expectations. Once the gloss of this historic election wears off, the world will find Obama cannot be president to the world. He can only be president of the United States and Americans will expect him to protect their interests first and foremost.","Analysis: Many see Obama as the epitome of the American dream .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- It's not easy being rich. At least that's what new findings suggest from ""The Millionaires Happiness Report"" released by the Shanghai-based Hurun Research Institute. ""In general, the report shows that the richer you are, the less happy you are,"" the report authors said. According to the inaugural report which surveyed 551 Mainland Chinese with a net worth of over 10 million yuan ($1.6 million), the average millionaire in China sleeps only 6.6 hours during the working week. Chinese millionaires are dissatisfied with their health and are looking to prioritize spending more time with their family, the report said. The ""self-made"" female super-rich, who were 37 years old on average, are more likely to be unmarried with 35% of the respondents being either divorced or having remained single. The figure is almost twice that of the men surveyed. The average age of all Chinese millionaires surveyed was 38 years old, rising to 40 among the ""super-rich"" -- those with net wealth of $16 million. The lack of satisfaction for China's nouveau riche appears to be growing. Hurun Report, a magazine best known for its ranking of the wealthiest individuals in China, surveyed 1,000 super-rich Chinese in 2011 found that 55% of the respondents either in the process of leaving China or seriously considering it. ""What we are seeing is a sense of insecurity or, perhaps you want to look at it from another side, looking for a sense of insurance policy,"" said Rupert Hoogewerf, publisher of Hurun Report, told CNN in November.

"(CNN)  -- A residential building in Spokane Valley, Washington, was being decontaminated after police removed a half pound of highly sensitive explosives from one of the apartments, a sheriff's spokesman said. John D. Raymond, 53, is being held on a civil bench warrant and is likely to face charges in district court Tuesday of illegally manufacturing and possessing explosives, said Sgt. Dave Reagan of the Spokane County Sheriff's Office. Raymond uses a wheelchair to get around and lived in a ground floor apartment of the 10-unit building. He was transported to jail by ambulance, Reagan said. A police robot removed a half pound of TATP, or Triacetone Triperoxide, from Raymond's apartment, Reagan said. TATP is extremely sensitive to impact, temperature change and friction, according to the defense and military Web site GlobalSecurity.org. It has been used by suicide bombers in Israel and was chosen as a detonator in 2001 by the thwarted ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid. The TATP in Raymond's apartment was placed in a bomb-proof container and taken to a county-owned gravel yard for detonation. ""It is too unstable to save as evidence,"" Reagan said. A secondary sweep of the apartment did not turn up any more TATP, but authorities were concerned about material found in the kitchen sink. As a precaution, the Spokane Fire Department HazMat unit has been called in to decontaminate the scene before residents are allowed to return to their apartments. Reagan said Raymond was angry about how his divorce case was being handled. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Police remove a half pound of highly sensitive explosives .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 41 people were killed and 106 others wounded Monday in a suicide bombing that targeted Shiite pilgrims in northeastern Baghdad, Iraq's Interior Ministry said. The female bomber detonated her explosive vest in the middle of a procession of pilgrims in Boob al-Sham, in a predominantly Shiite area of the Iraqi capital, according to an Interior Ministry official. The detonation took place in a tent set up to search females, according to the Baghdad Operations Command. Three volunteer female searchers were among those killed. The attack took place amid tight security as thousands of Shiite worshipers are making their way to the holy city of Karbala, south of Baghdad, to mark the Arbaeen -- the end of the 40-day mourning period at the close of Ashura. Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D. That event helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, the two main Muslim religious movements. There have been a number of roadside bomb and grenade attacks on pilgrims over the past few days. Iraqi officials have warned of attacks during the pilgrimage ahead of national elections on March 7.

"(CNN) -- If you're looking to unload your current iPhone or other smartphone, now's the time. Beating the potentially millions of folks who will be buying a new iPhone and selling their old one could put more money in your pocket. With Apple virtually certain to announce a release date for the next-generation iPhone next week, lots of current iPhone owners (always an excitable bunch) are no doubt counting down the minutes -- and wondering what to do with their current phones. While some retailers offer discounts for a trade-in (Radio Shack was offering $100 for some previous models when the iPhone 4 was released), Apple stores and their designated carriers generally don't give back as much cash, or credit, as an owner might earn outside the store. But a growing online resell market has emerged to give folks another option. Between now and Monday, the day before Apple has scheduled an iPhone-related event, one of those sites, Nextworth, is offering $250 for 16GB and 32GB iPhone 4s that are in good shape. The company, which also has trade-in programs at some retail stores, bills itself as a way to get value out of your aging electronics while keeping the products out of landfills, where they can cause environmental problems. The services wipe all data from your phone as soon as they get it, they say. Nextworth, and others like them, refurbish used electronics and resell them. In the case of items like the iPhone, they sell them in countries where the items are typically unavailable, presumably bringing a healthier price. Gazelle.com is offering $250 for a 32GB iPhone 4 in ""flawless"" condition and $169 for one in good condition. Got a busted model? It'll give you $85 for one even if it won't turn on or is physically damaged. Of course, there are always the direct-sale sites like eBay and Craigslist. You might earn more in exchange for the hassle of posting, selling and delivering the phone yourself. Folks were selling 32GB iPhone 4s on eBay on Friday for prices ranging from $245 to $634. In Atlanta, people had listed 32GB iPhone 4s for prices ranging from $290 to $450. (We're using prices on that model because it's the top of the line. Older phones, like the 3GS, and 16GB and 8GB models obviously have a market as well, generally at lower prices). Of course, the low-effort way to deal with a phone upgrade is to buy the new one at full price and just hold on to your current model. Even retired, your current phone can be a music player or Internet-surfing device when you have a Wi-Fi connection.","As iPhone 5 nears, resell market for current models emerges .

She said, ""Riyo, you're young, you can dance, you can teach dancing, you love it, it's good -- but maybe you should see a different world. Just go for it."" And I said, 'OK' and now I'm here. CNN: What's it like for you to be back in Shizuoka? Riyo Mori: It's so nice to be back home. I can relax, I can sleep. This is my first vacation, I think -- just having fun with my family, my friends, and talking to my friend in a café. That was my normal life before and since I became Miss Universe it suddenly stopped. I always have to be in the mood, and I have to be Miss Universe, so this is just perfect for me to be in my hometown of Shizuoka. CNN: How would you describe your relationship with Tokyo? Riyo Mori: I love Tokyo, like I love New York; I love big cities. The first time I came to Tokyo was even before becoming a finalist for Miss Universe Japan. I was so excited. Also I was scared too, because people look so fashionable and people look so confident here and I was just a tourist from the countryside. I was very nervous. People from all over the world come to see Tokyo, and so that's why you can see very unique people here. People speak Spanish, French, German, English, and Japanese; there's a very mixed culture here . CNN: How would you define Tokyoites? Riyo Mori: I feel like people are so energetic here, so different from Shizuoka. People keep moving -- they never stop. Tokyo never sleeps. Tokyo people are so busy all the time. I wouldn't say they are cold, they're just busy; they don't have time to talk to others. I need a balance, I have to be in Shizuoka for maybe 50 percent of the year and I have to be in Tokyo too, because I need this energy. CNN: How did you become a dancer? Riyo Mori: I started to learn dance in mother's dance school. My mom is my best friend, of course, my mother and teacher. So we have very unique relationship. We are not just mom and daughter, we're also teacher and student. My mom teaches jazz dance, tap dance, modern dance, but she doesn't teach ballet. I thought I should learn how to teach ballet, so I can have different class than she has. So I went to Canada when I was 16. I went to high school and professional ballet school in Canada. It was very, very tough, but it was worth it now that I can teach ballet. Now I want to teach young people, through dancing, how to be positive, patient and happy. These three things are very important to me. Dancing means a lot to me, because dancing is my life, part of my life. I have been dancing for a long time -- maybe 17 years. Dancing is great because this is how I express myself; this is where I learned how to be confident. CNN: What was your mum's reaction to you winning Miss Universe? Riyo Mori: She was very happy when I won Miss Universe --'my daughter can travel the world and see people' -- see the culture that she couldn't. So she was very happy. CNN: Outside dancing, what else do you enjoy? Riyo Mori: I'm a huge fan of baseball. Baseball fans here in Japan are very supportive and crazy. They can go crazy too, but that's a good part of Japanese people -- if you like something, you're very into it and support it. CNN: What else do you love about the city? Riyo Mori: I think Tokyo is the best place to shop. Ginza is a great place and I like the atmosphere too. When I became finalist for Miss Universe Japan, almost every week I went to Harajuko to shop. Also, this is very close to Miss Universe Japan's office, so I was back and forwards to the office almost all the time. Maybe you have heard about Harajuku girl; there is a very famous street in Harajuku -- Takeshita-Dori -- and here you can find very crazy people, who dress up like dolls. There's a very crazy, unique fashion code -- that's why people like it.","Riyo Mori says her grandmother convinced her to enter Miss Universe .

"(CNN) -- On the eve of his second inaugural, President Obama appears smarter, tougher and bolder than ever before. But whether he is also wiser remains a key question for his new term. It is clear that he is consciously changing his leadership style heading into the next four years. Weeks before the November elections, his top advisers were signaling that he intended to be a different kind of president in his second term. ""Just watch,"" they said to me, in effect, ""he will win re-election decisively and then he will throw down the gauntlet to the Republicans, insisting they raise taxes on the wealthy. Right on the edge of the fiscal cliff, he thinks Republicans will cave."" What's your Plan B, I asked. ""We don't need a Plan B,"" they answered. ""After the president hangs tough -- no more Mr. Nice Guy -- the other side will buckle."" Sure enough, Republicans caved on taxes. Encouraged, Obama has since made clear he won't compromise with Republicans on the debt ceiling, either. Foreman: My last letter to the president . Obama 2.0 stepped up this past week on yet another issue: gun control. No president in two decades has been as forceful or sweeping in challenging the nation's gun culture. Once again, he portrayed the right as the enemy of progress and showed no interest in negotiating a package up front. In his coming State of the Union address, and perhaps in his inaugural, the president will begin a hard push for a comprehensive reform of our tattered immigration system. Leading GOP leaders on the issue -- Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, for example -- would prefer a piecemeal approach that is bipartisan. Obama wants to go for broke in a single package, and on a central issue -- providing a clear path to citizenship for undocumented residents -- he is uncompromising. After losing out on getting Susan Rice as his next secretary of state, Obama has also shown a tougher side on personnel appointments. Rice went down after Democratic as well as Republican senators indicated a preference for Sen. John Kerry. But when Republicans also tried to kill the nomination of Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense, Obama was unyielding -- an ""in-your-face appointment,"" Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, called it, echoing sentiments held by some of his colleagues. Will Obama's second inauguration let America turn the page? Republicans would have preferred someone other than Jack Lew at Treasury, but Obama brushed them off. Hagel and Lew -- both substantial men -- will be confirmed, absent an unexpected bombshell, and Obama will rack up two more victories over Republicans. Strikingly, Obama has also been deft in the ways he has drawn upon Vice President Joe Biden. During much of the campaign, Biden appeared to be kept under wraps. But in the transition, he has been invaluable to Obama in negotiating a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on the fiscal cliff and in pulling together the gun package. Biden was also at his most eloquent at the ceremony announcing the gun measures. All of this has added up for Obama to one of the most effective transitions in modern times. And it is paying rich dividends: A CNN poll this past week pegged his approval rating at 55%, far above the doldrums he was in for much of the past two years. Many of his long-time supporters are rallying behind him. As the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to score back-to-back election victories with more than 50% of the vote, Obama is in the strongest position since early in his first year. Smarter, tougher, bolder -- his new style is paying off politically. But in the long run, will it also pay off in better governance? Perhaps -- and for the country's sake, let's hope so. Yet, there are ample reasons to wonder, and worry. Avlon: GOP's surprising edge on diversity . Ultimately, to resolve major issues like deficits, immigration, guns and energy, the president and Congress need to find ways to work together much better than they did in the first term. Over the past two years, Republicans were clearly more recalcitrant than Democrats, practically declaring war on Obama, and the White House has been right to adopt a tougher approach after the elections. But a growing number of Republicans concluded after they had their heads handed to them in November that they had to move away from extremism toward a more center-right position, more open to working out compromises with Obama. It's not that they suddenly wanted Obama to succeed; they didn't want their party to fail. House Speaker John Boehner led the way, offering the day after the election to raise taxes on the wealthy and giving up two decades of GOP orthodoxy. In a similar spirit, Rubio has been developing a mainstream plan on immigration, moving away from a ruinous GOP stance. One senses that the hope, small as it was, to take a brief timeout on hyperpartisanship in order to tackle the big issues is now slipping away. Zelizer: Second-term Obama will play defense . While a majority of Americans now approve of Obama's job performance, conservatives increasingly believe that in his new toughness, he is going overboard, trying to run over them. They don't see a president who wants to roll up his sleeves and negotiate; they see a president who wants to barnstorm the country to beat them up. News that Obama is converting his campaign apparatus into a nonprofit to support his second term will only deepen that sense. And it frustrates them that he is winning: At their retreat, House Republicans learned that their disapproval has risen to 64%. Conceivably, Obama's tactics could pressure Republicans into capitulation on several fronts. More likely, they will be spoiling for more fights. Chances for a ""grand bargain"" appear to be hanging by a thread. Two suspicions are starting to float among those with distaste for the president. The first is that he isn't really all that committed to bringing deficits under control. If he were, he would be pushing a master plan by now. Instead, it is argued, he will tinker with the deficits but cares much more about leaving a progressive legacy -- health care reform, a stronger safety net, green energy, and the like. Politics: Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company . Second, the suspicion is taking hold that he is approaching the second term with a clear eye on elections ahead. What if he can drive Republicans out of control of the House in 2014? Then he could get his real agenda done. What if he could set the stage for another Democrat to win the presidency in 2016? Then he could leave behind a majority coalition that could run the country for years, just as FDR did. Democrats, of course, think the real point is that Obama is finally showing the toughness that is needed. We are surely seeing a new Obama emerge on the eve of his second term. Where he will now lead the country is the central question that his inaugural address and the weeks ahead will begin to answer. Will you be attending President Obama's inauguration weekend?

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced a voluntary recall of 223,000 popular strollers following the death of an infant eight years ago and the near strangulation of another in 2006. The heads of the two infants became entangled between the tray and seat. But officials didn't link the cases to a specific brand and model of stroller until recently. The recall involves Venezia and Pliko-P3 strollers made by Peg Perego, USA Inc. In 2004, a 6-month-old California boy died after his head was trapped between his stroller's seat and the tray. In the 2006 incident, a 7-month-old New York girl nearly died from similar circumstances. ""Entrapment and strangulation can occur, especially to infants younger than 12 months of age, when a child is not harnessed,"" the CPSC said. ""An infant can pass through the opening between the stroller tray and seat bottom, but his/her head and neck can become entrapped by the tray. Infants who become entrapped at the neck are at risk of strangulation."" Manufactured between January 2004 and September 2007, in a variety of colors, the strollers were sold nationwide at retail outlets, according to the CPSC. Since the stroller models involved in Tuesday's recall were manufactured, newer models have been developed that don't pose the same risks. ""This recall is part of a larger effort by CPSC to address fatalities that occurred prior to new and better stroller standards being in place,"" CPSC spokesperson Patty Davis told CNN. In 2008, a voluntary industry standard went into place addressing the height of the opening between the stroller's tray and the seat bottom. Because used strollers are a popular item on many auction and aftermarket websites, customers are advised to check the model number used stroller they buy to make sure it isn't part of a recall. A complete list of recalled model numbers can be found on the CPSC website: http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml12/12232.html .","Recall involves two models made by Peg Perego, USA Inc. between 2004 and 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Ted Haggard, the former megachurch pastor and former National Association of Evangelicals chief whose career was undone by a sex and drugs scandal in 2006, will appear in a cable TV special this month. ""Ted Haggard: Scandalous"" will explore his fall from grace, he said. ""It shows the drama and the intrigue"" that exploded following revelations that he had engaged in sexual encounters with a male prostitute and purchased crystal meth. Haggard described the scandal as ""highly embarrassing and shameful for me."" The show is scheduled to air on TLC on January 16. In 2006, Haggard acknowledged having received a massage from a Denver, Colorado, man who said that the prominent pastor had paid him for sex over three years. Haggard also admitted he had bought methamphetamine but said he threw it away. Those statements led the Board of Overseers at New Life Church to fire Haggard as senior pastor. The church's independent investigative board said he was guilty of ""sexually immoral conduct."" After the allegations were made public, Haggard resigned as president of the influential National Association of Evangelicals, an umbrella group representing more than 45,000 churches with 30 million members. But the special goes further than the scandal, he said, documenting Haggard's attempt to build a new ministry in Colorado Springs, Colorado. ""It's the resurrection story,"" he said. He likened his journey to NFL quarterback Michael Vick and former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, co-host of CNN's ""Parker Spitzer,"" both of whom endured scandal but have recently returned to the public eye. Haggard's St. James Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, has 300 congregants, he said, a far cry from the thousands who heard him preach in his heyday at crosstown New Life Church. The church, which is not affiliated with any denomination, opened its doors in June. ""All are welcome. Whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, gay, straight, bi-(sexual), tall, short, addict, recovering addict. ... I believe Jesus' arms are open to all,"" Haggard said at the time. This is not the first post-scandal TV show Haggard has appeared in. The 2009 HBO documentary, ""The Trials of Ted Haggard"" revealed the financial hardships his family was facing after his ouster from New Life Church. Haggard said he's still struggling financially. ""We're still living on the equity of our home,"" he said.","Haggard said he got a massage from a man who said the pastor had paid him for sex .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The United Nations moved Wednesday to calm tensions along the Blue Line separating Lebanon and Israel, a day after violence erupted. In an extraordinary meeting, the commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, Major-General Alberto Asarta Cuevas, led talks between top representatives of the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israel Defense Forces. The meeting was held at the U.N. position at the Ras Al Naqoura crossing in south Lebanon. ""UNIFIL informed the parties that a thorough investigation into yesterday's events is under way and presented its preliminary findings,"" UNIFIL said. ""UNIFIL urged the parties to exercise maximum restraint, avoid any action that could serve to heighten tensions, and work with UNIFIL in taking steps to prevent any recurrence of such a situation,"" it said. Asarta said both parties were committed to ending hostilities and to complying with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, the agreement that ended a five-week war between the Lebanese group Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. Resolution 1701, which was intended to resolve the 2006 conflict, bars Israel from conducting military operations in Lebanon. Israel has accused Lebanon-based Hezbollah, considered a terrorist group by the United States, of violating the resolution by smuggling arms into southern Lebanon. The United Nations said Tuesday's violence broke out after Israel announced it planned to cut down a tree near the Blue Line, the line of demarcation that Resolution 1701 requires both sides to respect. UNIFIL said Wednesday that the tree was in Israeli territory. A Lebanese army unit stopped the Israelis, and U.N. peacekeepers intervened, Lebanon's official National News Agency said. The Lebanese army said it asked the U.N. force to arbitrate the issue, but the Israeli forces didn't comply and instead entered Lebanese territory. That led the Lebanese army to open fire, with Israeli forces returning artillery fire and hitting a house in the village of Odaise. An Israeli officer was killed. The National News Agency said two Lebanese soldiers and a journalist were killed. ""The exchange of fire started, although we did our best to prevent it,"" Alain Le Roy, the world body's top peacekeeping official, told reporters in New York. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon and the Palestinians Wednesday that Israel would react with force to what he called violent provocation against its citizens. ""I want to make it clear to the Hamas and to the Lebanese government that they are responsible, that we see them responsible for the violent provocation against our soldiers,"" Netanyahu said. ""Do not test our determination to protect the citizens of Israel and its soldiers. Our policy is clear: Israel will react and will continue to react with force to any attack against its citizens and soldiers,"" he said. Netanyahu appealed to the international community to support Israel's right to defend itself. ""The U.N. announcement today clearly corroborates the Israeli version of events,"" said Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, in a written statement. ""Our routine activity yesterday was conducted entirely SOUTH of the frontier -- on the Israeli side -- and that the Lebanese army opened fire without any provocation or justification whatsoever."" But UNIFIL said, ""The investigations are still ongoing"" and the body's findings will be released only after they conclude. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said Israel violated U.N. Resolution 1701 in crossing the Blue Line and by bombing a Lebanese army checkpoint in Odaise. He said Israeli aggression needs ""to be confronted, whatever the sacrifices are"" and that he will pursue the issue diplomatically. Meanwhile, Egypt blamed the Palestinians for this week's rocket attacks on Red Sea port cities in Israel and Jordan, the official MENA news agency reported. A senior Jordanian official told CNN that Egyptian investigations proved that Palestinian factions from Gaza were behind a rocket attack in Aqaba. One person was killed and five others wounded when a rocket landed in front of a hotel, the official Jordanian news agency, Petra, reported. Several apparent rocket explosions also were heard in the nearby Israeli city of Eilat, the Israeli military reported. No damage or injuries were reported. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri called the Egyptians ""unprofessional and unreliable"" and said they were politically driven to justify the blockade of Gaza. CNN's Saad Abedine, Nada Husseini and Michal Zippori contributed to this report.","NEW: UNIFIL chairs talks between Israelis, Lebanese .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Irish victims of sexual abuse are ""disgusted"" by a newly revealed letter in which a Vatican official expresses ""serious reservations"" about requiring bishops to report suspected abuse by priests to police, they said Wednesday. Abuse survivors will question the cardinal leading a special papal delegation to Ireland about the letter, they said. ""We are disgusted by details revealed in the letter. Many of our members just can't take this in and have been deeply affected by the revelations,"" Survivors and Victims of Institutional Abuse spokeswoman Margaret McGuckin told CNN. The 1997 letter from the Vatican's envoy to Ireland warns bishops to follow church law in investigating cases of suspected child sex abuse by priests. The envoy expresses ""serious reservations"" about requiring that such cases be reported to the police. The Vatican has called the letter ""deeply misunderstood"" since it was made public by Irish state broadcaster RTE this week. CNN obtained a copy of the letter on Tuesday from a lawyer who represents the Vatican. A spokesman for the Conference of Irish Bishops said they have since 1996 had a policy of reporting suspected abuse to the police. Victims of abuse are due to meet Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor on Friday, they said. He was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI last year to work with the Irish church after revelations of widespread abuse by priests and cover-ups by their superiors. ""The meeting with the cardinal couldn't have come at a better time -- we will be letting him know exactly how we feel, will be putting many questions and will be demanding answers,"" McGuckin said. A spokeswoman for the cardinal declined to confirm he would meet victims on Friday, citing the sensitivity of the issue. The two-page letter, written by Apostolic Nuncio Luciano Storero, was sent to bishops in Ireland in response to a document they had sent to the Vatican that recommends mandatory reporting of cases of suspected child sex abuse by priests. After studying the Irish bishops' document, the Vatican's Congregation for the Clergy said it contains ""procedures and dispositions which appear contrary to canonical discipline and which, if applied, could invalidate the acts of the same bishops who are attempting to put a stop to these problems. ""If such procedures were followed by the bishops and there were cases of eventual hierarchical recourse lodged at the Holy See, the results could be highly embarrassing and detrimental to those same diocesan authorities,"" Storero wrote. ""In particular, the situation of 'mandatory reporting' gives rise to serious reservations of both a moral and a canonical nature,"" he added. RTE said it had received the letter from an Irish bishop and that Catholic officials in the country had previously refused to release it. The RTE program ""Would You Believe?"" said Pope Benedict XVI is now doing more than any previous pope has done to tackle abuse, but asked whether that has been enough. Martin Long, a spokesman for Irish Catholic bishops, said the pope had twice in the past year urged them to follow procedures the church established to protect children. ""Also the Irish Church maintains its policy of mandatory reporting of abuse allegations,"" Long said, calling on the Irish government ""to introduce law which facilitates mandatory reporting of allegations of sex abuse."" Jeffrey Lena, the lawyer representing the Holy See in the United States, said in a statement that ""the letter in question has been deeply misunderstood."" He said its primary purpose ""was to help ensure that bishops who discipline their priests for sexual abuse did so in a manner that would ensure that the priest not avoid punishment based upon technical grounds. This is precisely the opposite of what has been reported in many press accounts."" The letter also raised questions about the canonical validity of what Lena called the ""study document"" produced by the Irish bishops' conference. ""As such, contrary to media reports, the letter did not constitute a rejection of the position of the conference,"" he said. ""Finally, and again in stark contrast to news reports, the letter nowhere instructed Irish bishops to disregard civil law reporting requirements."" Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said the letter rightly insists that canon law be respected to ensure that guilty priests have no grounds for recourse. ""We need to remember that the letter was written before the norms of 2001,"" which clarified the matter, he said. But victims' and survivors' groups in Ireland said the letter proves the protection of pedophile priests from criminal investigation was not only sanctioned by Vatican leaders but ordered by them. One in Four, an organization representing victims of sexual abuse in Ireland, said the letter raised questions about the inquiry into child sex abuse by clerics in Ireland. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests raised similar concerns. ""In the mid 1990s, Irish bishops wanted to start telling law enforcement about horrific child sex crimes,"" the group said in a statement. ""Top Vatican bureaucrats told them no. That's what this newly released letter shows. We can't help but wonder how many other similar documents -- in which the Vatican thwarts local efforts to combat abuse -- remain hidden in church records across the world."" ""It's certainly an embarrassment for the Vatican,"" said CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen Jr. ""It's another confirmation that, in the late 1990s, there was deep ambivalence in the Vatican about how far they should go in terms of reporting priestly sex abuse to civil authorities."" But, he added, ""It's not a smoking gun because it is not a directive. Not an order. This is one Vatican official giving his opinion. It is not a policy document."" Current church policy calls for such cases -- learned about outside the confessional -- to be reported to police, he said. CNN's Ben Brumfield and journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report.","Victims will grill a cardinal representing the pope on Friday, they say .

Some avid social-network users are commissioning artists to create small digital images to represent themselves in the online world. Other Internet-savvy people use automated computer programs and Web sites to generate posterized likenesses of themselves. Matt Held, a 38-year-old painter in Brooklyn, New York, has gained Internet celebrity for painting peoples' Facebook photos and then giving them to his subjects. And some identity researchers are trying to take the online portrait beyond images of people's faces entirely. All of these efforts underscore the fact that tiny images, often no bigger than a postage stamp, have become stand-ins for peoples' identities online.   On the Web, people can recreate themselves in any way they choose. Unlike in the real world, where portraits are largely reserved for museums and the mantels of self-centered celebrities, online portraits are either free or relatively inexpensive. They're also essential for effective Internet communication, said Judith Donath, a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society. ""In the physical world, there's a lot of effort people make in terms of how they look when they go out to walk down the street. Some people spend two hours to get ready going to the grocery store,"" she said. ""In the physical world, there's the actual self, so you're not entirely dependent on a portrait."" On the Internet, though, people can create their appearance through images they choose to represent themselves, she said. Donath is working with a group of students from the MIT Media Lab to take online portraiture beyond realistic-looking faces. In the future, she says, people will create pictures of themselves with the data trails they leave online. Visit the ""Personas"" project and type in your name to see how this might work. Donath said many people online are drawn to the fact that they don't have to look like the person they are in the real world. But this is also a sticking point in the world of online portraiture, said Dan Schawbel, a personal branding expert and author of a book called ""Me 2.0."" People should brand themselves online with a single professional photo that they display on all of their social networks so that strangers will be able to identify them, he said. ""Seeing the same thing again and again and again is going to make you remember it,"" he said, adding that photographs of human faces are more emotional and memorable than drawings or other obscured representations. Erika Peterman would disagree. The 39-year-old in Tallahassee, Florida, paid $100 for local artist Lee Bretschneider to draw a caricature of Peterman as a comic book hero. She uses that image on her blog and on Facebook. ""I do think an illustration is a way to unleash some fantasy aspect of yourself or maybe the way you'd like other people to see you,"" she said. Peterman, who blogs about comics and has read them since she was young, said her stylized comic-book image says something about her and is more compelling than a standard photo. She said she's not trying to hide anything behind the drawing. ""I look how I look and I'm not fooling anybody,"" she said. ""If the artist had me looking like Halle Berry, that'd be ridiculous."" Joel Watson, who illustrates an online comic book series from Dallas, Texas, said he's gotten so many requests from fans asking him to draw avatars for their online social networks that he can't keep up with the demand. He said some clients came back to him several times wanting new drawings because they had shaved off their hair or somehow changed their look. Each of these efforts cost $50 to $100, he said. Several free Web sites offer to posterize a person's Facebook or Twitter icons, or let users assemble cartoon versions of themselves. The latest to catch on in a big way is a spin-off of the AMC show ""Mad Men."" On a site called MadMenYourself.com, people create stylized images of themselves as sleek advertising executives from the 1960s, in keeping with the show's theme. Dyna Moe, the 31-year-old New York artist who created the character components for the site, said at first she was ""creeped out"" to see so many computerized versions of her drawings floating around social networks. On Twitter, where tiny square icons stand in for a person's identity, it also became difficult to tell who some people were because the Mad Men icons all started to look similar, she said. It had a ""hall of mirrors feeling,"" she said. The Web site had 8 million viewers the first week it launched, she said. MG Siegler, a blogger at TechCrunch, said his fans and friends found it jarring when he took down a photo from his social networks and replaced it with a ""Mad Men"" avatar. ""They're like, 'Oh, what's going on here? Is there some sort of life change that you switched up your icon for?' "" he said. ""It's kind of funny that people do very much pay attention to them. I think people start to associate your identity with your [Twitter] icon,"" he said. Held, the painter in Brooklyn, is completing a series of 200 Facebook portraits. He chooses his subjects from a Facebook fan page called ""I'll have my Facebook portrait painted by Matt Held,"" where more than 6,400 people have signed up. The project struck a surprising chord with people and helped pull him out of a lull in his career, Held said. While people in his paintings can use the images online free, he sells the canvas works in galleries for $1,800, he said. ""Portraiture in itself has always been there, but I want to bring it out to the masses,"" he said. ""There are so many people out there with awesome photos and awesome stories who I feel need to be painted.""","The portrait, a centuries-old art form, is finding new life with the masses online .

"(CNN) -- A barge collision near New Orleans spilled oil into the Mississippi River on Friday, prompting authorities to close a five-mile stretch of the waterway. The St. Charles Parish Department of Waterworks shut down both of its water intakes located in New Sarpy and Luling because of the spill, but said the incident did not pose a public threat. The area had been reopened, with some restrictions, by Friday afternoon as investigators continued to assess the damage, officials said. No injuries have been reported, and preliminary estimates put the spill at less than 10,000 gallons of crude oil. Response agencies have remained on the scene. The spill was started after a tanker barge towed by a motorized vessel, Settoon, ran into a construction barge towed by the tugboat Alydar just before 2 a.m. Friday near Reserve in St. John Parish, west of New Orleans. U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Lt. Suzanne Kerver said the tanker barge suffered a 10 feet by 5 feet gash above the water line, allowing crude oil to spill out of the 214,000-gallon tank. The leak has since been contained, said Lt. Paul Rhynard, also of the Coast Guard. Oil Mop, a contracted cleanup company, was on the scene and has deployed 100 feet of boom, Kerver said. ""One of our priorities is to facilitate the safe continuation of commercial traffic,"" said Coast Guard Capt. Pete Gautier. ""Safety is paramount, and the unified command is working to minimize the impact this spill has on people, the environment and commerce.""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's Anbar province -- once dominated by Sunni insurgents but now a bastion of tribal opposition against the militants -- will soon be run by the Iraqi military. Iraqi soldiers will soon be responsible for running the once militant-riven province of Anbar. The U.S. military said it would transfer security responsibility for Anbar this week to the Iraqi military, a bellwether event that illustrates what Iraq and the United States describe as a profound stride in their efforts to foster stability. Anbar is the 10th of the 18 provinces where Iraqi forces have taken charge of security control since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and the first largely Sunni Arab province to do so. The other provinces to take charge are in the Shiite south and the Kurdish north. ""We have seen a dramatic increase in security there,"" said Rear Adm. Patrick Driscoll, Multi-National Forces spokesman, speaking to reporters in Baghdad on Sunday. ""I think that the trend now in Anbar is to move from the violent kinetic to the rebuilding process,"" he said. Anbar province -- west of Baghdad -- is a vast territory where Iraq shares borders with Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Much of the region is desert, and most of the people there live in in the towns and cities -- such as Falluja and Ramadi -- along the Euphrates River. Sunni Arabs, such as those in Anbar, became politically marginalized when the Shiites and Kurds took over the new Iraqi government from the toppled Hussein regime, which had been dominated by and was most amenable to Sunnis. Many Sunni Arabs in Anbar became active in the insurgency, and foreign fighters made their way into Anbar via Syria. As a result, the Euphrates River valley region was a hotbed of insurgent activity in the early years of the Iraq war. U.S. Marines launched several offensives against the militants, including a large-scale push in late 2004 in Falluja. Al Qaeda in Iraq and other militants eventually developed a strong foothold in many towns. Major changes occurred in Anbar over the last two years, however, with the emergence of the awakening, the grass-roots tribal movement that opposes al Qaeda in Iraq. That movement aided efforts by the U.S. military and Iraqi security forces to fight al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), and violence there has dropped dramatically in the last two years. While Sunni tribes in Iraq were natural allies for the insurgency when it started in 2003, many locals eventually became disenchanted with what it regarded as al Qaeda in Iraq's brutality, corruption and hard-line enforcement of sharia law. The tribal movement in Anbar has developed into a political force and has helped spawn another development: U.S.-backed Iraqi militias -- such as Sons of Iraq and Awakening Councils -- formed in the Sunni regions of Iraq over the last couple of years. The Pentagon's June report to Congress on developments in Iraq said that in Anbar, the ""average number of security incidents remained at five incidents per day over a 90-day period, accounting for less than 4 percent of the attacks in all of Iraq."" ""This represents a 10-fold reduction compared to the summer of 2006 and is half of the rate of the last few months of 2007."" AQI ""continues efforts to regain footholds"" in the valley, the report said. But the Sons of Iraq and U.S. and Iraqi troops ""continue to hinder AQI's ability to obtain resources or operate effectively in population centers, forcing AQI to operate and conduct attacks from remote locations in the province."" At present, the other provinces that have transitioned to Iraqi security control are Duhuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya in the Kurdish region, and Karbala, Najaf, Muthanna, Thiqar, Basra, and Maysan in the Shiite south. The other province to change over to Iraqi security control this year is Qadisiya in the south.","Iraqi military set to run the once militant-riven Anbar province .

"(CNN) -- A NASA review released Wednesday found no evidence that astronauts flew aircraft or spacecraft while under the influence of alcohol. NASA found no evidence to back up claims that intoxicated astronauts have been allowed to fly. The agency carried out the review after anecdotal evidence emerged of astronauts flying while intoxicated. The report, written by Bryan O'Connor, chief of NASA's Office of Safety and Mission Assurance and himself a former astronaut, was posted on the agency's Web site. ""Within the scope and limitations of this review, I was unable to verify any case in which an astronaut spaceflight crewmember was impaired on launch day, or any case where a manager of a flight surgeon or co-crewmember disregarded their recommendation that a crewmember not fly shuttle or Soyuz,"" O'Connor wrote. The review was ordered in July after an independent panel commissioned by NASA reported two alleged cases in which astronauts were so intoxicated that flight surgeons or fellow astronauts raised concerns over flight safety. The astronauts in question were allowed to fly, the panel said. The committee was convened by NASA to look into the agency's medical and psychological screening processes after the February arrest of former astronaut Lisa Nowak for the alleged attempted kidnapping of another astronaut's love interest. Nowak has pleaded not guilty to the charges. ""Interviews with both flight surgeons and astronauts identified some episodes of heavy use of alcohol by astronauts in the immediate preflight period, which has led to flight safety concerns,"" the committee's July report said. ""Alcohol is freely used in crew quarters. Two specific instances were described where astronauts had been so intoxicated prior to flight that flight surgeons and/or fellow astronauts raised concerns to local on-scene leadership regarding flight safety. However, the individuals were still permitted to fly."" Because the independent committee had promised its witnesses anonymity, committee members were reluctant to divulge sourcing information to O'Connor. So, O'Connor interviewed about 90 current and former astronauts, flight surgeons, nurses, technicians, managers and staff of the crew quarters. He also reviewed records of calls to safety hotlines, submissions to the NASA Safety Reporting System and NASA's close call and mishap reporting systems for any evidence pointing to astronaut alcohol abuse. He found no evidence of inebriated astronauts, the report said. Though individuals were able to file reports anonymously, none did so, he said. ""The lack of privacy on launch day makes it nearly impossible to hide alcohol use or alcohol-induced impairment,"" O'Connor wrote. ""Could a crewmember drink to the point of inebriation in his/her room the night before launch? Certainly, but, from the time the crew wakes on launch morning until they lift off, they are surrounded by other astronauts, managers, support crew, television cameramen, still photographers, crew quarters staff and others."" The review recommends that NASA position a flight surgeon in the suit-up room as astronauts are making their final preparations before departing for the launch pad ""to allow more direct contact with the crewmembers on launch day and reduce the reliance on a suit tech (non-clinician) picking up any last-minute medical issue.""

"Moscow (CNN) -- Pilot error, slight intoxication of the navigator, and a failure of the crew to interact properly caused a plane crash that killed 47 people in June of this year, Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) said Monday. The crew should have circled to make a fresh attempt at landing in poor weather conditions, the IAC probe found. It ""was the failure of the crew to decide on a go-around and descend below the minimal established safety altitude in the absence of visual contact with approach lights and landmarks which resulted in the collision of the aircraft with trees and ground,"" the IAC said. The report comes out nearly two weeks after another plane crash that killed dozens of Russian and international hockey players in Yaroslavl, Russia. An investigation into that crash is ongoing. Monday's report examined a Tupolev-134 airliner that went down June 20 in the Russian northwest city of Petrozavodsk. The jet with 43 passengers and a crew of nine took from Moscow for Petrozavodsk, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) to the north. Controllers lost contact with the twin-engine plane, and it crashed onto a highway outside Besovets, near the Petrozavodsk airport, the Transportation Ministry reported. ""The first thing that the plane had contact with was a pine tree of about 15 meters high,"" Alexander Neradko, head of the Russian Federal Aviation Agency said on Russian state TV at the time of the crash. ""This proves that the plane didn't break in mid-air but that all that destruction was inflicted to it as a result of that contact,"" he said. Nearly 140 rescue workers, doctors and police officers responded to the crash. The IAC investigates and analyzes aviation accidents in the former Soviet Union, and oversees civil aviation across the region.","A Russian plane should have circled for another landing attempt, a report says .

"(CNN) -- A New York businessman says Tampa, Florida, socialite Jill Kelley asked him for an $80 million commission if she used her influence to win a South Korean business contract. Kelley, who triggered an FBI investigation that led to the resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus, claimed she was a high-level representative of the South Korean government, says the businessman, Adam Victor. In reality, according to the South Korean Foreign Ministry, Kelley holds a simple honorary title -- ""special consul"" -- which boasts no official responsibilities. With the prospect of a commission on a $4 billion deal to provide natural gas, Kelley ""tried to sell herself as something she was not,"" Victor, president of TransGas Development Systems, told CNN. ""I told her she was crazy."" It's not the only time Kelley has claimed to have privileges because of a special diplomatic status. On Sunday, she called 911 complaining that a man she didn't know was on her property, describing herself as an ""honorary consul general"" with ""inviolability."" A spokesman for Kelley did not return CNN's phone calls seeking comment. Although there have been no allegations of wrongdoing, it's among the latest twists in a story with possibly troubling ramifications on several levels, including, potentially, national security. Pillow talk: A spy agency's 'worst nightmare' Kelley came under public scrutiny after Petraeus quit last week, admitting his extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. Anonymous e-mails sent to Kelley prompted her to alert the FBI, which eventually uncovered the affair. Kelley has close ties to several high-ranking military figures, including Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Living not far from MacDill, home of the U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, Kelley and her husband, Scott, a doctor, hosted parties attended by high-ranking military officials. She even took part in a Special Operations Command-sponsored parachute dive, the Army said. An $80 million commission would have been helpful to the Kelleys. She and her husband have struggled with financial troubles, according to public records. Their Tampa-area home, which was purchased in 2004 for $1.5 million, has been the subject of foreclosure proceedings since April 2010. Records show a total of 11 lawsuits involving the Kelleys. Kelley is well-connected to the local military culture. In October 2010, she took part in a parachute skydive organized by the U.S. Special Operations Command. The jump was part of a program that ""reached out"" to members of Tampa's civilian community and the media, a command spokesman said. Hosting foreign guests was not unusual for the Kelleys, a high-ranking former CENTCOM military officer said. In a May 14 e-mail obtained by CNN, Kelley invites Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn to join her at her home for dinner with ""a group of VIP's visiting from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Napal, (sic) here by the authority of the State Department. ..."" Read Kelley's e-mails . Many guests at Kelley's parties were foreign liaison officers attached to the so-called Coalition Village at MacDill's sprawling compound, the source said. Most of those foreign liaisons were not cleared for sensitive classified access to military documents. ""They frankly didn't have a lot to do,"" the former officer said, ""and looked forward to the parties given by the Kelleys."" While the Kelleys opened their mansion to military brass, perhaps understandably, they haven't been as welcoming to members of the news media parked outside. Kelley complained about it in an e-mail obtained by CNN that was sent to Buckhorn at 5:57 a.m. Tuesday. ""Bob,"" wrote Kelley, ""Hope all is well. Can you help out with the obstruction by the paparazzi, since they're blocking our alley, our driveway and continue to trespass on my property. My kids are scared, and need their 'home' back."" Another e-mail from Kelley complained about Tampa police releasing recordings of her 911 calls last weekend. ""... my family has been put through the ringer and my kids are scared,"" Kelley wrote in the e-mail. ""And to put insult to injury, your police dept. gave the local 911 tapes to the press! My home address and cell phone number is played on them. I have been receiving threats all night, by people that now have my cell phone number. I cannot understand why your dept. would release my address and cell number and make me and my daughters in harms way."" Although 911 recordings released by officials often include caller phone numbers and addresses, most major news organizations do not release that information as part of the recordings. Another fact that has emerged is that Kelley visited the White House complex three times since September 28, once for a tour with her family and twice for courtesy meals in its cafeteria with her sister and a White House staffer, a White House official said Friday. The staffer met the family during a visit to MacDill Air Force Base, the military installation near where the Kelleys live.

"Washington (CNN) -- Now that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice has withdrawn her name from consideration for secretary of state, her supporters are criticizing those who brought her down as well as President Barack Obama, a long-time friend, who they say left her twisting in the wind. ""I'm not just disappointed that President Obama didn't go forward (with the nomination). He accepted her resignation not to put her name forward,"" Donna Brazile, CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist, said on the Situation Room. ""I can understand that the president doesn't want to use all of his political capital, re-fight these battles,"" Brazile said. ""They had the knives out for Susan, a whole bunch of people. This is an old boys' network. This is how it operates."" Susan Rice withdraws her name from consideration as secretary of state . Rice withdrew her name from consideration to become the top U.S. diplomat on Thursday after drawing heavy criticism from Arizona Sen. John McCain and other Republicans over her public statements about the deadly attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, in September. In a letter to Obama, she said the Senate ""confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive, and costly â€” to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities. That trade off is simply not worth it to our country."" Last month, Obama defended Rice at a White House press conference and challenged her Republican detractors to ""go after me"" and calling the character attacks ""outrageous."" But Obama stalled for weeks on nominating Rice or anyone else, which indicated her prospects for the job were dim. Ultimately, Rice's possible nomination was a casualty of a deeply partisan climate in an ongoing political showdown between Obama and Republicans over the handling of the Libya attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. A lucky day for Susan Rice . ""The Rice incident does not represent a significant deviation from the partisan standards of the recent past in Washington,"" Rothkopf said. ""In other words, every so often a candidate is targeted and blocked by one party or the other. It happens more often (with) the Supreme Court than with Cabinet posts or ambassadorships. But it happens."" Rice became the administration's point person on explaining events in Benghazi. In multiple TV appearances just days after the attack, Rice said the violence apparently was linked to a protest over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States. Senior U.S. officials have said Rice's comments were based on an intelligence assessment that was later revised to reflect the belief that it was a planned terrorist assault. McCain was withering in his criticism of the administration's initial public explanation. He said ""this president and this administration has either been guilty of colossal incompetence or engaged in a cover up, neither of which are acceptable to the American people."" McCain is well known for his bluntness but Rice also has a reputation for being a aggressive and an effective operator in the corridors of power during her years in Washington. ""I guess my theory is that she's a sharp-tongued, blunt person, and, in the past, she has taken some shots at John McCain and others, and so this is their chance,"" conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks said recently on PBS' Newshour of GOP criticism of Rice before her withdrawal. Opinion: An unfair portrait of Susan Rice . ""They have no wellspring of sympathy with her, the way they actually probably do with John Kerry, her potential rival to be the next secretary of state, having taken a bunch of delegation trips with Kerry around the world. And so, I suspect there's a lot of old history here that is bubbling up,"" he said. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Rice, who was then serving as the Obama campaign's senior foreign policy adviser, called McCain's proposed terrorism policies ""dangerous."" Other factors in the Rice saga were at play as well, Rothkopf said. ""I think it is more complicated than that and has roots associated with a variety of other factors: the political origins of the debate over Benghazi during the campaign, McCain's dissatisfaction with answers Rice gave him in person (that deepened his concerns), his ties to and preference for other choices for the job, and so on,"" Rothkopf said. Rice was reportedly defensive during her followup meetings with lawmakers aimed at addressing their concerns with her Benghazi comments. That apparent impression raised red flags with other senators on the fence about her prospects for higher office . McCain is seeking a slot on the Foreign Relations Committee next year to be in a position to help weigh in on the next secretary of state and could be in place to question Kerry, a fellow decorated Vietnam veteran, if he is nominated to the position. McCain, who has a good relationship with Kerry, and other Republican senators have said they would prefer to see the Massachusetts Democrat and current foreign relations chairman, running American diplomacy. Rice once appeared to be the inevitable secretary of state . CNN's Ted Barrett, Dana Bash, Ashley Killough and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Rice withdrew her name from any consideration as secretary of state .

"(CNN) -- The latest constitutional amendment being floated by some Senate Republicans -- to deny citizenship to children born in the United States to unauthorized immigrants -- is not new. Calls for modification of the 14th Amendment's birthright citizenship guarantee have appeared during other moments of immigration-related hand-wringing. The question is whether the idea is a good one. And the reform is not unthinkable from a democratic point of view. In fact, the United States and Canada stand apart from other major immigrant-receiving societies in the breadth of birthright rules. The United Kingdom amended its laws in 1981 to provide that only children born to citizens, or permanent residents born in the U.K., are citizens at birth. In 2004, voters in Ireland amended their constitution along similar lines, in part for reasons familiar to the American audience: fear that birthright citizenship attracted asylum claimants who could use their children as anchors. The French rule allows children born to foreign parents to become citizens at the age of majority (when the state no longer considers a person a minor), rather than at birth. But if ever there were a case for maintaining American exceptionalism, the 14th Amendment is it. Rejection of universal birthright citizenship would upend practices vital to the success of the American venture. The proposed amendment's implicit premise, that children of parents who have broken the law do not deserve U.S. citizenship, contradicts a basic American value: the sins of the parents should not be visited upon the children. Justice Robert Jackson put it succinctly in dissent from the Korematsu decision (1944), which found Japanese internment policies during World War II constitutional: ""If any fundamental assumption underlies our system, it is that guilt is personal and not inheritable."" Justice Harry Blackmun reasoned similarly in Plyler v. Doe (1982) when striking down a Texas law that would have denied unauthorized children access to public schools. Frustration with illegal immigration, he wrote, ought not lead to unequal treatment of children who had no hand in creating their ""illegality."" U.S. courts and most legal scholars have consistently interpreted the Citizenship Clause to apply universally, save to the children of diplomats, invading armies and Native Americans (though the Supreme Court has never directly addressed the status of children born to unauthorized immigrants). The clause thus operates as a constitutional reset button. Each generation born in the U.S. stands on its own, with equal citizenship status, regardless of parentage. Given our history as a society of immigrants, this rule has been crucial to our development into a cohesive political community and to our ability to integrate each new immigrant cohort. It ensures that those who are born and raised in the United States have an equal opportunity to participate and contribute and are regarded by others as full Americans. Not all children born in the U.S. remain, and perhaps those Senate Republicans envision deporting all unauthorized immigrants and their children. But clear-eyed pragmatism tells us that most children born here also go to school, become socialized and enter adulthood here, making them functionally American. Unless we are prepared to tolerate the emergence of castes based on parentage, universal birthright citizenship and a robust naturalization regime should remain in place. The goals of the proposed amendment are not strictly punitive, though its effects inevitably would be. Its supporters argue it would reduce incentives for illegal immigration. But this argument is not serious. The obstacles to passage are nearly insurmountable, and this particular amendment has never come close to succeeding. More important, changing the birthright rule would have little to no effect on illegal immigration. No doubt stories exist of Mexicans crossing the border just to give birth or of tourists arranging vacations to produce U.S.-citizen children. But the actual causes of illegal immigration are complex and overwhelmingly related to the absence of job opportunities in Mexico and the demand for immigrant labor in the U.S. Precisely because illegal immigration is difficult to prevent, lawmakers substitute symbolic posturing for genuine policymaking. Though the 14th Amendment is likely safe, it is instructive whenever politicians propose manipulating it to remember its historical role. The reset principle can also inform debates over other issues, such as the DREAM Act, which would legalize high school graduates who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Even the debate over whether to legalize existing unauthorized immigrants, which is more complex because of their culpability, would benefit from an appreciation of how second chances can advance equality and integration. The conventional interpretation of the 14th Amendment reminds us that we take our aspirations to equality seriously. We are willing to risk certain costs, such as opportunistic immigration and the creation of citizens who may never develop ties to the U.S., to ensure political equality. For the United States to stand alone on this principle does nothing less than reaffirm traditions that have helped turned a collection of people from all over the world into an integrated and powerful success. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cristina Rodriguez.","14th Amendment guarantees U.S. citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil .

"(Hong Kong) (CNN) -- The day after the biggest murder trial in recent Chinese history, the country's state media ran stories about the defendant, Gu Kailai, the high-powered wife of deposed Chinese politician Bo Xilai, but kept headlines off the front page. The court is still deliberating the case against Gu. She and a family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, are accused of poisoning British businessman Neil Heywood in a hotel room in the city of Chongqing last November. According to a court official, Gu's defense team raised no objection to the prosecution's charges, detailed Thursday in a one-day trial, a month after she and Zhang were charged with murder. Before Thursday's court appearance, Gu and Zhang hadn't been seen publicly since their arrest in April-- and they have been unreachable for comment. On Friday, most major Chinese publications including the Global Times, People's Daily, Beijing Daily, Beijing News, Guangming Daily and Beijing Morning Post published stories about the trial, but they were relegated to page three and beyond. One article in the Beijing Times included a sketched image of Gu, but otherwise no photos were published and the reports carried the same story published on state-run news agency, Xinhua. Discussion about Gu's trial and the surrounding scandal was blocked on social media Friday, but netizens in China appeared to be using code names to evade censors. One user on Sina Weibo, the Chinese microblogging site, referred to Bo, the former Communist Party chief of Chongqing, and his wife, Gu as ""B&G."" The user wrote: ""B&G case is under strict censorship in China thus not seen on media, all we can see is the standard CCTV version. By contrast the case is attracting intense international attention and making headlines almost everywhere."" ""The immense international attention is natural considering how high-level it is and the great impact on Chinese politics."" Some netizens expressed support for Bo, referring to him as ""Grandfather Bo"" and wrote about missing his leadership. Other posts played off Bo's last name, which can mean thin, weak or poor in Chinese, and some obliquely used the word ""tomato,"" apparently to refer to Chongqing, which literally means ""the red city in the west."" Gu's trial has been closely watched by international media, however proceedings were closed to international journalists who clustered outside the court house in Hefei Thursday. After the trial, Chinese-run state television, CCTV showed clips of Gu appearing before the court and walking outside flanked by police. ""It's a very carefully staged, supposedly public trial, but it isn't public at all,"" said Jerome Cohen, a law professor at New York University. ""It's just carefully organized and highly limited in who can attend."" The Shakespearean-like saga involving Gu and Bo has become one of the most sensational Chinese political scandals in recent memory. Before the allegations in the case came to light, Bo was considered to be a strong contender for entry to the Politburo Standing Committee, the nine-member team that steers Chinese policy. But, Bo has now been stripped of all his political titles and is being investigated for what officials call, ""serious disciplinary violations."" He has been out of the public eye and unreachable for comment. However, when the scandal first broke, Bo denied any wrongdoing and accused critics of slinging mud at the family for political reasons. The scandal comes just months before the country's senior leaders meet to hand over the reins of power to the next generation of leaders, a once-in-a-decade event. Gu and a family aide, Zhang, are accused of poisoning Heywood, a 41-year-old British businessman who was found dead in November in the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing, the city where Bo was the Communist party chief. Gu's trial ended after seven hours on Thursday. The verdict will be delivered at a later date after deliberations, according Tang Yigan, deputy head of the Hefei Intermediate People's Court. Tang delivered a statement to the press after the trial Thursday, divulging some details of the case against Gu. Chinese authorities have said that Gu and her son had ""conflicts"" with Heywood ""over economic interests"" and that she was motivated to kill the Briton because of fears for her son's safety. Cohen, the co-director of New York University's U.S.-Asia Law Institute, suggested that attempts to block discussion of the trial on social media might only encourage speculation and rumor amongst the Chinese public. In the absence of facts, rumors can spawn ""some very sophisticated conspiracy theories, many of which are wrong,"" he said. ""Unless there is some kind of investigation reported to the public I think the Chinese people who are highly sophisticated and now have the internet and social media, they will remain very, very suspicious of what's going on,"" he said. Gu's trial is considered one of China's most high-profile cases since the Gang of Four trial in 1980. The Gang of Four, comprised of four officials including the widow of Mao Zedong, was tried for their role in the country's ill-fated Cultural Revolution. All four were imprisoned after a trial that lasted for six weeks. Cohen said he watched their televised trial in China more than three decades ago. Since then, ""there have been enormous changes,"" he said. ""Now you have codes of law, you have legal institutions, hundreds of thousands of judges, prosecutors, lawyers, a lot more experience than they had before. But in the end, one has to ask what has changed fundamentally with respect to criminal justice?""

"(CNN) -- Long before Chen Guangcheng became internationally known as a human rights crusader, villagers near his home knew him as the man to go to when they had trouble with local authorities. Despite having little formal legal education, Chen began advocating on behalf of villagers in 1996 at the age of 25, according to China Human Rights Defenders, a China-based human rights group. Chen has been at the center of a burgeoning international impasse since his dramatic escape last week from the guards who kept him under house arrest in a small village in eastern China. He was confined to his home after serving four years in prison, apparently over his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices such as forced abortions by China's family planning officials. Fellow activists say he made his way to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where he remains as the United States and China try to sort out the future for Chen, who has sought to call attention to the practice of forced abortions and sterilizations in China. Yet he never sought out to be a rabble-rouser, said New York University law professor Jerome Cohen, who first met Chen when the activist traveled to the United States as part of a State Department program in 2004. ""You got the feeling you were in the presence of some Chinese equivalent of Gandhi or something,"" Cohen said. ""He had this gentle but steely moral force."" Chen was born in 1971 in Dongshigu, a small farming village in eastern Shandong province, more than 400 kilometers (248 miles) from Beijing. After an eye infection left him blind as a child, Chen seemed destined to a farmer's life, just like his parents. But at the age of 17, Chen's fortune turned when he learned of a school for the blind in a nearby city. Chen learned the law from television and radio broadcasts, newspapers and books. He also took a few constitutional law classes at the college for the blind -- where the primary course of study was massage therapy. ""When he came back to his village, he didn't want to spend his time giving massages,"" Cohen said. ""He wanted to help people who weren't getting help elsewhere."" He quickly became known locally as an advocate for farmers and the disabled in Shandong, where he offered free advice on taxes and corruption and stood up for the disabled. ""Someone has to fight for people with no voice,"" Time magazine quoted him as saying. ""I guess that person is me."" He also helped his village obtain a system to pump well water, making clean water easily accessible to villagers for the first time and helping cement his local reputation, Cohen said. His desire to continue helping the disabled and voiceless led Chen and his wife, Yuan Weijing, to take on concerns that officials in Linyi, a city in Shandong, were using violence and coercion in a campaign to enforce China's policy limiting many couples to one child. The investigation carried him to Beijing, where he pressed national officials to take action against the local authorities. It also carried him to prison, where he spent four years behind bars on what supporters called trumped-up charges before authorities confined him to house arrest in 2010. What Chen was fighting: forced abortions . In a video released after his escape last week, Chen said he and his family were beaten and cut off from the outside world during their detention. The case that brought him to international prominence began in 2005. That's when he learned of claims that local officials were requiring parents with two children to be sterilized and forcing abortions in women pregnant with their third child, according to human rights groups. The officials were trying to meet birth quotas set by the national government, according to Amnesty International. In June 2005, three months after beginning his investigation, Chen organized a lawsuit against local officials and traveled to Beijing to meet with legal experts and tell international journalists about his findings. Hours after meeting with journalists from Time, he was taken into custody by government agents and sent back to his home, where he was placed under house arrest. Authorities also refused to allow his lawsuit to proceed. Chen escaped from house arrest at that time as well and ventured to Beijing, where he met with supporters -- including Cohen. Chen was pale, anxious, with little appetite, Cohen said. But it was apparent even then that the people he was trying to help with his legal efforts was what concerned him, not his own welfare, Cohen said. ""One day, when he was especially frustrated by the county court's refusal to accept the lawsuits he brought on behalf of impoverished pro bono 'clients,' he asked me: 'What do the authorities want me to do? Lead a protest in the streets? I don't want to do that,'"" Cohen said in testimony to the Congressional-Executive Committee in November. Ironically, that's what authorities soon accused Chen of doing. His August 2006 conviction on charges of ""intentionally damaging property and gathering crowds to disturb transport order"" led to a four-year prison sentence. Human rights groups roundly called the charges trumped-up and demanded his release. Instead, Chen went to prison where, according to Amnesty International, fellow prisoners beat Chen on orders of guards, authorities refused him medical treatment and limited visits with his wife and lawyers to no more than 30 minutes a month. By this time, the detained activist had turned into an international cause celebre. Time selected him as one of 2006's ""Top 100 People Who Shape Our World,"" along with Premier Wen Jiabao. The following year, the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, which grants prizes to Asians who excel in their fields, named Chen among its honorees for his ""irrepressible passion for justice in leading ordinary Chinese citizens to assert their legitimate rights under the law."" After serving his sentence in September 2009, Chen was released to house arrest, but he and his family continued to endure abuse, according to human rights groups and Chen himself. In a video released April 27, Chen said guards repeatedly beat him and his wife and prevented visitors from reaching their home. ""All the stories online about the brutal treatment I received from the Linyi authorities, I can personally testify they are true,"" he said in the video posted to YouTube. ""The reality is even harsher than the stories that have been circulating."" In the video released after Chen's escape, he called on Chinese authorities to leave his family alone and punish the officials who he says illegally detained him and engaged in abuses against him and his family. The man whose ever-present dark sunglasses have become a symbol for supporters worldwide also posed a question to Chinese officials who have taken great steps to keep his name and likeness out of the national media and discussions. ""If you continue to ignore me,"" he said, ""what would the public think?""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- BP, which is responsible for the greatest oil spill in American history, has made the right call in deciding to suspend dividend payments this year. Dividends are not legally required; they are optional. If BP does not pay a dividend, a shareholder cannot go into court and sue BP. Dividends are to be paid only when the company has enough money to take care of its operations, including potential liability for the spill. Some have argued that BP should pay dividends this year because there are plenty of individuals who count on those quarterly dividends. That is a familiar argument. It conjures images of the elderly being forced to choose between buying food or medicine. That imagery was raised in 2003, when President Bush pushed a dividend tax cut through the Republican-controlled Congress, reducing the maximum tax rate to be paid on dividends to only 15 percent. (You and I pay taxes on our interest and wages at rates up to 35 percent.) The reasons for the tax cut were varied, from compensating for risk to encouraging savings to an argument that it ""will help millions of seniors who depend upon dividend income for their day-to-day expenses,"" a line from congressman Sam Johnson of Texas. Johnson was certainly not alone in arguing that the dividend tax cut would help senior citizens. Bush's signing statement provided that ""we're helping seniors who rely on dividends."" What the Republicans neglected to say was that it was not taxpayers' senior status that made it more likely that they would receive dividends, but their income levels. The typical low- or middle-income senior does not have a lot of income and does not receive dividends. A 2006 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed that only 4 percent of households with less than $50,000 of income own stock and actually receive capital gains and/or corporate dividends. Only 11 percent of households with incomes under $100,000 receive capital gains and/or corporate dividends. However, more than 75 percent of all capital gains and dividend income goes to households with income over $200,000, which represents only 3 percent of all U.S. households. The reality is that the typical American BP shareholder is not really going to miss that dividend payment. British newspapers have reported that U.K. pension funds have heavily invested in BP, so the impact could be somewhat greater there. BP has agreed to create a $20 billion escrow fund that will be administered by an independent third party, Kenneth Feinberg, the mediator who oversaw the September 11 victims' claims. This is certainly a step in the right direction. BP is not obligated to pay the $20 billion all at once but has several years to fund the escrow account. Any amount paid to shareholders is forever lost to victims of the Gulf spill. So if BP were to pay any dividends now and subsequently become financially unable to make more payments to the escrow fund, the Gulf victims would become victimized again. Shareholders who own stock in an oil company that drills offshore without adequate plans in place, should disaster strike, have made a risky investment indeed. Given the potentially catastrophic impact of the oil spill, how can BP really know how much all of the costs will be? And the safest course of action is to wait until the company gets a better handle on its potential liabilities, which seem to be growing daily. Between the business owners in the Gulf with their very livelihoods being threatened, the workers who are unable to earn a living and the looming environmental cleanup costs (once the oil actually stops spilling into the ocean) on the one hand and BP's shareholders on the other hand, the choice is easy: The shareholders should wait for their dividends. After all, isn't that why their tax rates are so low? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dorothy Brown.","BP decided to suspend dividends for rest of year as it creates escrow fund for liability .

"(CNN)  -- Globalization washes like a flood over the world's cultures and economies. Floods can be destructive; however, they can also bring blessings, as the annual floods of the Nile did for ancient Egypt. The world's great universities can be crucial instruments in shaping, in a positive way, humankind's reaction to globalization and the development of humankind itself. Traditionally, universities have been defined and limited by location, creating an academic community and drawing students and scholars to that place. Eventually, some universities began to encourage students to study elsewhere for a semester; today most do. Recently, some -- even those known for their cautiousness about innovation -- have developed ""branch campuses,"" or outposts at which graduate or undergraduate degrees are granted. The benefits of globalization are not evenly spread, but it is unalterably part of the landscape, and it is causing the world to miniaturize. The great question is how our institutions will respond to this global miniaturization. Will it be out of fear, feverishly attempting to cabin off themselves, or with an eye on the opportunities, and the possibility of creating a new age of cultural and intellectual ecumenism. For universities, the latter should be a far more comfortable fit. This natural instinct of universities connects well with the emerging contours of economies in the ""knowledge century"": that they will be driven by ideas and creativity, and that this world network of thought and innovation will be concentrated in a small set of global ""idea capitals"" among which the talented and creative will circulate. These idea capitals will be characterized not merely as centers of finance, insurance and real estate (the FIRE sector), but also as centers of intellectual, cultural, and educational activity (""ICE,"" as I have called it elsewhere). The world's most enlightened leaders have accepted a crucial proposition: universities, especially research universities, will be principal incubators and drivers of the ICE sector. Great universities attract and retain the creators, innovators, and entrepreneurs who propel thought, both producing and consuming intellectual, cultural and educational activities. How will universities shape themselves to meet this? There will be many models -- some incremental, some bold. One new university model is already proving itself at NYU: the ""global network university."" In opening NYU Abu Dhabi last week, NYU has created not only a new liberal arts university campus but a new university architecture. NYU Abu Dhabi is a second ""portal campus,"" along with our long-standing campus in New York; these are the anchors and basic hydraulics of a network that also knits together 12 other academic sites. The global network university allows faculty and students to move seamlessly through the network  and around the world without separating themselves from the university's intellectual community and resources. It is a veritable Mobius strip of talent and thought. Research labs continents apart can be connected, increasing their potency. Faculty in one location can be made available to students in another. Consider: A professor in New York can offer a course featuring participation by students at several sites. The professor assigns team exercises, with students from many different sites working together. That interaction will be powerful in itself, but that need be only the start: We'll likely see some or all of the students deciding to come together the following semester at one of the network sites. By uniting portal campuses and other academic sites, the global network creates an organic circulatory system that mirrors the flow of talent and creativity that increasingly defines the world. The result is more than an internationalized university with loose connections between a central location and branches around the globe; instead, the talent and assets become fully available to enhance research and learning in every other part. In higher education, nothing is more powerful than a good idea. And this idea has resonated strongly. In the first class of undergraduates admitted to NYU Abu Dhabi, just 2.1 percent of applicants were admitted -- fewer than 200 of over 9,000 applicants. They hail from 39 countries, speak 43 different languages, with nearly 90 percent of them bilingual; and have SAT scores at 75th percentile -- 770 for verbal and 780 for math. These scores match the most highly selective universities in the world. Universities tend to be hidebound, but they will need to change. I don't claim that the global network university will be the universal form for higher education's future; there are other ways to respond to academic globalization that will endure and make sense. But to thrive, universities will need to look very different from the way they do now, and they will have to find a form well-suited to the new reality of an ever- increasing flow of human capital and talent in the knowledge century.

"(CNN) -- Aiman Youssef can't catch a break with the weather. First, Superstorm Sandy leveled his home and devastated most of his neighborhood in the New York City borough of Staten Island. Now, an arctic blast that forecasters warn can have deadly consequences is gripping the region. A gas-powered heater and a tent was the only defense Youssef had late Thursday from the biting cold as he handed out jackets and sweaters at a makeshift supply depot he established to help his Midland Beach neighbors who, in some cases, are still struggling to get the power back on. ""A lot of people have been coming so we give them jackets, we give them sweaters,"" he told CNN affiliate NY1. ""Yeah, we are trying. We are trying our best to help them."" But even as he helped his neighbors, he wondered how long he could keep the heater running at the tent where some of his neighbors were seeking shelter. Gas, he said, is expensive. Exposure to subfreezing temperatures has left at least three people dead in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois, according to authorities. The National Weather Service forecasters urged caution early Friday as they warned ""bitterly cold conditions"" were expected to continue across much of the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast into the weekend. Widespread light snow showers were expected across the upper Great Lakes region and across the Ohio Valley before moving later in the day across the eastern United States, according to the weather service. Forecasters at the National Weather Service predicted 1 to 4 inches of snow for areas in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic regions on Friday with the Carolinas and Tennessee Valley getting freezing rain beginning early in the morning. The snow was expected to move later in the day into the eastern United States. It was not good news in portions of New York and New Jersey, where homes destroyed by Superstorm Sandy in places such as Staten Island and Far Rockaway, Queens, lacked basic utilities needed to restore heat. With temperatures plummeting, warming centers were opened in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and other areas, according to various emergency management officials. Schools shuttered, planes grounded . Dozens of school systems in Tennessee and some in northern Georgia said they would be closed. Schools in Raleigh, North Carolina, will close early, a spokesman with Wake County schools said. ""We're going to make sure we put a plan in place so that the buses are rolling while it's still safe and the students are back home before weather becomes an issue,"" he told CNN affiliate WRAL. Road crews in North Carolina began salting major and secondary roads on Thursday in an attempt to avoid the possible repeat of a January 19, 2005, storm that stranded thousands, including 3,000 Wake University students on campus. Cindy Mease ended up sleeping on the floor of her office after a failed attempt to try to get home in that storm. ""It was just a cluster. I mean, it was crazy out there,"" she told CNN affiliate WRAL in Raleigh. ""(Cars would) hit a hill, and people would just start sliding back down."" Travelers were already feeling the effects of the storm. A spokeswoman for Nashville International Airport said all inbound American Airlines flights for Thursday night and Friday morning were canceled. Though she had no official word from other carriers, Emily Richard said she anticipated they also would cancel flights. Caught in the snow . The snow in Pennsylvania played a role in the apprehension of suspected armed robbers, according to authorities. Investigators in Moon Township, just outside of Pittsburgh, tracked the footprints of three people and arrested them in connection with the robbery of a taxi driver at gunpoint after tracking their footprints in the fresh snow on Wednesday, police told CNN affiliate KDKA. The footprints in the fresh snow, according to police, led from the scene of the robbery to the front door of one of the suspects.

"(CNN) -- Last week the U.N.'s senior official for extrajudicial executions, Philip Alston, argued in a critical report and remarks delivered in Geneva, Switzerland, that the United States should explain the legal rationale for the CIA's campaign of drone strikes in northwest Pakistan, which he characterized as ""a vaguely defined license to kill"" that has created ""a major accountability vacuum."" Alston is also urging the Obama administration to disclose the number of civilians killed in the drone strikes. That is a controversial matter among the Pakistani public, less than a tenth of whom support the strikes, because of their perceived high civilian death rate. The drones' latest important victim is Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, an Egyptian founding member of al-Qaeda who served as the group's number three and was in charge of overseeing the group's plots, recruitment, fundraising and internal security. While Yazid's death is doubtless a blow to the terrorist group, al-Qaeda seems to have a stash of number threes waiting in the wings. At least eight men who have held that slot since 2001 have since ended up in jail or dead. Yazid joins three other number threes who have met their fates at the wrong end of Hellfire missiles: Muhammad Atef, Hamza Rabia and Abu Laith al-Libi. Yazid was not the only casualty from the drone strike that killed him: Reports say his wife, three daughters and a grandchild also died in the May attack in the mountainous Pakistani tribal agency of North Waziristan, a reminder that militant leaders are not the only ones to be felled by drones. According to our count, the drones program in Pakistan has reportedly killed at least 976 people since 2004, of whom approximately two-thirds were described as militants or suspected militants in reliable press accounts, indicating that a third of the victims were not militants. The Obama administration has already authorized 90 drone strikes in and around Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), double the number the Bush administration authorized in its two terms in office. The accuracy of the drone strikes has improved even as the pace of the program has increased over the past two years. In 2008, the first year the drones program picked up speed in Pakistan, an average of only 43 percent of the fatalities from the strikes were reported to be militants or suspected militants. In 2009, that figure shot up to 62 percent, and so far in 2010 it stands at 87 percent, suggesting that the nonmilitant death rate from drone strikes has dropped to around 10 percent this year, according to our database. Overall, since Barack Obama took office, his administration's drone strikes in Pakistan have killed an average of 71 percent militants, compared with the Bush administration's 55 percent, according to reliable media accounts. The Obama administration drone strikes also seem to be having more success eliminating militant leaders, as at least 13 have been confirmed killed in drone attacks since Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, compared with 16 during the Bush administration's five years of authorizing drone strikes in Pakistan. This increase in accuracy targeting both high-level and lower-level al-Qaeda and Taliban members appears to stem from the CIA's use of smaller missiles and increased cooperation with the United States' Pakistani counterparts who, despite public protests about violations of their national sovereignty by the drone strikes, have quietly been sharing vital intelligence. An unnamed U.S. official commented, ""You need guys on the ground to tell you who they [the targets] are and that isn't coming from some white guy running around the FATA."" After 26 strikes in the Pakistani tribal region of South Waziristan during the first 10 months of 2009, they halted after the start of Pakistan's military ground operations there in mid-October 2009, another indicator of U.S.-Pakistan cooperation about the drones program. As Pakistan gears up for operations in North Waziristan -- the last redoubt for a militant mélange that includes the Haqqani network, various factions of the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda -- the United States has fired more drone strikes than ever into this region: 37 of 2010's 39 reported strikes have hit targets in North Waziristan. So far no drone strikes appear to have targeted Osama bin Laden, who occasionally releases audiotapes taunting the United States as he did a few weeks after the alleged botched Christmas Day attempt by an al Qaeda affiliate to blow up a Northwest Airlines passenger jet over Detroit, but who otherwise has vanished into the wilds of the Afghan-Pakistan border region. And al Qaeda's number two official, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was last targeted by a drone strike in January 2006, has since then proven equally elusive. The criticism of the drone program by the United Nations official Philip Alston seems to have had little impact on the Obama administration, which is plowing ahead with drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal regions on the grounds that they are ""effective, exact and essential."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.

"(CNN) -- A massive cold weather system pushed perilously cold temperatures from the Upper Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic on Monday, triggering blinding snows in some areas that spawned a number of traffic pileups in Ohio alone, including one fatal accident. Residents of 14 states, from North Dakota to Virginia, faced wind chill warnings or advisories due to frigid temperatures combined with strong winds heading into Tuesday. But the possibility of light snow around President Barack Obama's inaugural festivities in Washington did not materialize despite colder temperatures. The day saw a mix of sun and clouds with temperatures mostly freezing. The January cold did not dissuade hundreds of thousands of people from turning out on the National Mall for the festivities. It was a different story in Brainerd, Minnesota, where residents braced for readings of 26 degrees below Fahreinheit on Monday night. Wind chills would make it feel more like 30 to 40 below, according to the National Weather Service. Overnight temperatures in Pittsburgh should be just above freezing with wind chills at 14 below. It is all part of a mass of Arctic air moving east on Monday from the Dakotas, bringing bone-chilling temperatures and occasional snow. More sustained snows fell around the Great Lakes region. That's been the case in much of Ohio where low visibility and snow-covered roads caused serious traffic crashes. Near whiteout conditions from a snow squall spurred one of the worst accidents in Colerain Township, about 12 miles north of Cincinnati. The pileup involved 86 vehicles, including 70 cars and 16 commercial vehicles, along a roughly quarter-mile stretch of Interstate 275, according to Colerain Township Fire Capt. Darian Edwards. One person was killed and 20 others were transported to area hospitals, Edwards said. Authorities rescued four people from three vehicles in three different spots along the highway. Around the same time and about 30 miles east in Warren County, heavy snow and low visibility contributed to a crash on Interstate 75 that involved 52 cars, said Ohio State Highway Patrol Sgt. Sean Whickman. Ten people were sent to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries and part of the highway was closed for four hours, he added. Another whiteout near Columbus caused a 23-vehicle crash on Interstate 270 in Westerville, said Lt. Jeff McIntyre of the city's fire department. Four people went to hospitals with minor injuries, he said. The highway was shut down for more than two hours. Several people about 55 miles north in Mansfield suffered minor injuries in an accident on Interstate 71 that involved 21 cars and four semis, according to a state highway patrol dispatcher. All four of these crash sites are among the hundreds of communities under wind chill advisories. At 30 below zero, frostbite can occur in as little as 10 minutes with the slightest winds, and in five minutes in a brisk breeze, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns. Newborns, the elderly and the homeless can quickly fall victim to hypothermia. ""Cold weather puts an extra strain on the heart,"" the CDC said, also noting that overexertion can become even more dangerous to those with heart conditions in the Arctic cold. Although such deep freezes are potentially deadly, they are not uncommon in the upper midsection of the United States.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Bond was set at $23 million Wednesday for a Los Angeles elementary school teacher who allegedly took bondage photos of more than two dozen students in his classroom -- $1 million for each of the 23 counts he faces of lewd acts on a child. The 400 photographs collected by investigators include some showing suspected semen-filled spoons at the children's mouths, a sheriff's investigator said. Mark Berndt, 61, appeared briefly before a Los Angeles judge for his initial court appearance Wednesday morning, represented by a court-appointed public defender. His next court appearance was set for February 21. Authorities arrested Berndt at his home Monday, and charged him with the 23 felony counts. ""I feel for those parents and for those babies -- those helpless babies,"" Wanda Mosley, a resident who lives near Miramonte Elementary School, told CNN affiliate KABC. The chilling accusations were a stunning betrayal for many parents. ""I'm angry. I'm disgusted. I'm sad,"" Kimberly Kirklin told the station. The probe started when a film processor gave investigators ""over 40 photographs depicting children in a school classroom, with their eyes blindfolded and mouths covered with tape,"" a Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement said. ""Investigators learned that some of the photos depicted suspect Mark Berndt with his arm around the children, or with his hand over their mouths,"" it said. Some photos show female students with ""what appeared to be a blue plastic spoon, filled with an unknown clear/white liquid substance, up to their mouths as if they were going to ingest the substance,"" the statement said. Other photos showed ""children with large live Madagascar-type cockroaches on their faces and mouths,"" it said. Investigators, who interviewed more than 80 current and former students and school employees, identified 23 boys and girls then between the ages of 7 and 10 years old as alleged victims in crimes that are believed to have been committed between 2005 and 2010, it said. The young students ""didn't realize they were victimized,"" sheriff's Sgt. Dan Scott said. ""They thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game,"" he said. ""And they were rewarded with cookies or spoons full of sugar (but) they did not realize the spoon contained semen."" The photographs also showed ""a large 3-inch cockroach that would crawl on their face,"" Scott said. A search of Berndt's home found more than 100 more similar photographs depicting children and a video depicting adult sexual ""bondage"" activity ""which mirrored the bondage-type photos of the children,"" investigators said. The film processor later gave investigators an additional 250 photographs, authorities said. About 10 children seen in the more than 400 images have not yet been identified, they said. The investigation began more than a year ago, officials said. ""Early in the investigation, Special Victims Bureau detectives recovered a blue plastic spoon and an empty container from the trash within the suspect's classroom,"" the sheriff's statement said. ""The recovered items tested positive for semen."" The arrest came soon after lab testing matched Berndt's DNA with semen found on the spoon, Scott said. Investigators did not reveal the contents of the fluid to the children or tell them that the case involved child molestation allegations, he said. The 30-year teaching veteran was removed from his job at the south Los Angeles on January 7, 2011, the day the sheriff's department told the school district about the investigation, Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy said. ""I am sickened and horrified by the behavior of Mark Berndt. This individual and his conduct do not reflect on the quality of the teachers who work so hard on behalf of the students in the Los Angeles Unified School District,"" Deasy said in a written statement. CNN was not able to identify or reach Berndt's lawyer until Wednesday's initial hearing. A neighbor who identified himself as ""John"" to CNN affiliates told KTLA that he had known Berndt for years. ""I said 'My God, he's been kind of freaky all these years I've known him. The way he talks and moves. I said, 'I'm not surprised.'""

"(CNN) -- A Los Angeles County Superior Court commissioner revoked the probation of actress Lindsay Lohan on Wednesday and ordered her to appear in court next month. ""In the case ending 679, probation is revoked,"" Commissioner Jane Godfrey told Lohan's attorney in court. ""Defendant ordered to appear."" Lohan, 26, wasn't in court Wednesday. The probation violation hearing will be on January 15. Photos: Celebrity mugshots . Lohan was on probation for a 2011 conviction on charges she stole a necklace, but that probation was jeopardized last month when the city attorney in Santa Monica, California, filed four charges against her in connection with a car crash last summer. Lohan's long history in the criminal justice system and her struggle with drugs and alcohol have taken her to court 19 times and to five rehabilitation facilities for a total of 250 days since January 2007. In the Santa Monica case, Lohan is accused of giving false information to a police officer, obstructing or resisting a police officer in performance of his duty, and reckless driving, according to the city attorney's office. The charges, all misdemeanors, stem from a car crash last June while Lohan was on her way to the set for the filming of ""Liz & Dick,"" a Lifetime movie that aired this week.

She is accused of telling police her assistant was driving the Porsche, while witnesses told investigators they saw Lohan behind the wheel. ""During the subsequent investigation, information was developed that Lohan was the driver of the Porsche when the accident occurred,"" the Santa Monica prosecutor said in a statement to CNN last month. On the day the city attorney filed charges last month, Lohan had been earlier arrested in New York in connection with an alleged 4 a.m. fight at a Manhattan nightclub. Lohan may have hit another woman at the Avenue Lounge, New York police said. Authorities declined to say whether she faced charges. In that case, Lohan's New York lawyer, Mark Heller, told CNN last month: ""Once again, Lindsay Lohan is a victim of someone trying to capture their 15 minutes of fame."" ""From my initial investigation, I am completely confident that this case will be concluded favorably and that Lindsay will be totally exonerated,"" Heller said of the New York incident.

"(CNN) -- The president of Florida A&M University said the college is canceling its summer band camp program and suspending all clubs as the school continues to deal with the fallout from the suspected hazing death of a marching band student. ""Our top priority is the health, safety and well being of students,"" said FAMU President James Ammons on Tuesday. ""We are convening a panel of experts and outstanding thinkers to provide advice and recommendations on the operation of student organizations. Before we enter into a new student intake process, we should have the benefit of the work coming from the committees and the investigations."" The move comes weeks after four members of the university's fabled Marching 100 band were arrested on hazing-related charges. Those charges are unrelated to the suspected hazing-related death of drum major Robert Champion in November. FAMU police arrested three of the students January 16; the fourth turned himself in the next morning, said Sharon Saunders, the FAMU spokeswoman. The students -- Hakeem Birch, Brandon Benson, Anthony Mingo and Denise Bailey -- are accused of hazing five Marching 100 band members who wanted to join a group in the clarinet section known as the ""Clones."" The five told police they were made to line up according to height at the start of each meeting. Then they were punched, slapped and paddled, according to the arrest warrant. One of the students, who quit the pledging process after the first meeting, took a digital photo of the bruising on her body. First established in 1990, the band camp has offered scholarships for aspiring musicians at high schools across the region. Following news of its cancellation, Twitter was abuzz with comments. ""The Marching 100 will weather this storm; it is up to the current members and the alumni to make it through,"" wrote Kimberly D. Evans, listed as Superior92Diva. ""Proud Alumni Famu Marching '100' member will always love my band family,"" added Errol V Mizell Sr. Champion's death prompted FAMU's board of trustees to approve a three-part plan to tackle the issue of hazing on campus. The plan includes an independent panel of experts to investigate. Champion, 26, collapsed in Orlando on a bus carrying members of the band after a November football game that included a halftime performance by the group. Christopher Chestnut, a lawyer for Champion's family, has charged that Champion died after receiving ""some dramatic blows, perhaps (having an) elevated heart rate"" tied to ""a hazing ritual"" that took place on the bus. Some band members have said Champion died after taking part in a rite of passage called ""crossing Bus C."" One member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that students ""walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members, and you get beaten until you get to the back."" No one has been charged in Champion's death; the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Orange County Sheriff's Office are investigating the case. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also launched a separate investigation into band employees, who were allegedly engaged in financial fraud. The medical examiner's office has said Champion ""collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body."" Ammons said in the Tuesday statement that he suspended the summer band camp because of the ongoing investigation into Champion's death and other band-related hazing incidents. ""I totally support this effort,"" said Breyon Love, president of FAMU Student Government Association. ""This issue of hazing has had a far-reaching impact on the university and I believe that we need to pause for a moment to make sure that all of our students are ready to seriously move in a direction which will result in a complete culture change.""

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- Whitney Houston's journey ""home"" ended with a private burial in New Jersey on Sunday as questions persist about what caused the superstar's death. A crowd gathered at the entrance to Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, south of Newark, where Houston's body arrived late Sunday morning. She was laid to rest next to her father in the cemetery. Her burial brings an end to her ""coming home,"" as her family dubbed the invitation-only memorial service held a day earlier at her childhood church in Newark. The family-only burial is in contrast to the emotionally charged, star-studded memorial service held at New Hope Baptist Church, where Houston, nicknamed ""Nippy,"" was soloing in the junior choir by age 11. ""Jesus Loves Me"" was the last song Houston sang in public before her death on February 11 in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 48. So it was fitting that the mourners -- comforted and encouraged by the likes of Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys and R. Kelly -- heard the simple, but powerful, ""Jesus Loves Me,"" this time performed by CeCe Winans. The mourners inside the church represented an amalgamation of Houston's life, from childhood friends to gospel singers, from music stars to movie stars. ""You literally felt like this was just a girl from New Jersey who had a few famous friends, and it was such a celebration of life,"" CNN producer Raelyn Johnson, who attended the funeral, said Sunday. ""It is the same church service that will go on in so many churches across the country this morning ... and it was celebration, it was singing, it was praise for three hours."" Johnson said. ""And it wasn't until the very end that you remembered that this was a funeral and a very sad day for a lot of people."" Kevin Costner, who cast Houston in her first role alongside him in ""The Bodyguard,"" recalled how she questioned whether she was good enough, beautiful enough to be cast in the film. ""It was the burden that made her great and the part that caused her to stumble in the end,"" he said. For her closest friends inside the church, and strangers who continue to draw inspiration from her voice, Costner's words hit a painfully honest note about human frailty. Years after ""The Bodyguard"" hit theaters, reports of Houston's struggles with drug addiction and a rocky marriage with Bobby Brown surfaced and her album sales declined. ""The inexplicable burden that comes with fame,"" Costner said. ""Call it doubt. Call it fear. I've had mine. I know the famous in the room have had theirs."" Costner said Houston's own story could help a new generation of young girls who dream big. ""Maybe they're thinking they aren't good enough,"" he said. ""I think Whitney would tell you: Guard your bodies. Guard the precious miracle of your life. Then sing your hearts out, knowing that there's a lady in heaven who's making God himself wonder how He created something so perfect."" One of the most emotional moments in the service came when Keys recalled how Houston helped her and others achieve success. ""She reached back to so many people; she reached back to me, to Monica and Brandy ... and just made us feel strong and capable and loved,"" she said. Keys ended her tribute to Houston by singing ""Send Me an Angel,"" her voice soaring into the rafters of the sanctuary. Oprah Winfrey, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Spike Lee were among those who attended. ""It wasn't until the very last moment that you pinched yourself and said, 'There's Oprah Winfrey with a face full of tears, there's Tyler Perry with a face full of tears,"" said Johnson, recalling the moment that Houston's casket was carried out of the church. ""It all really sunk in and got really, really heavy."" Houston's former husband, Bobby Brown, also arrived at the service but left soon after. Brown walked by Houston's casket with his head down before the service began and then left. Brown accused security of treating his family badly and barring him from visiting with his daughter, an account that Houston's family denied. Brown was expected to attend with two guests but showed up with 10 people and sat in a section reserved for family, a close friend of the Houston family told CNN on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. When Brown refused to reseat his entourage to make room for Houston's mother, the family asked police to intervene, the family member said. Mourners heard only a few indirect references to her personal battles. A close family friend told CNN recently that Houston had not used ""hard drugs"" for several years. Investigators are examining prescription drugs found in her hotel room. At the time of her death, Houston was in the Los Angeles area for the annual Grammy Awards and was to attend a party hosted by her longtime mentor and record producer, Clive Davis. She was discovered dead in her hotel suite at the upscale Beverly Hilton. Investigators are contacting doctors and pharmacies across the country, seeking answers about prescriptions found in Houston's hotel room and whether they played a role in her death, a source with knowledge of the investigation recently told CNN. The source spoke on condition of anonymity citing the ongoing investigation. Houston's death certificate is only fueling speculation after coroners deferred making a determination as to the cause of death pending the outcome of toxicology tests. The investigation also sparked questions on her behavior during her final days, with authorities examining video from her television appearances as well as other reports to determine her physical state leading up to her death on the eve of the Grammy Awards, the source said. CNN's Jason Carroll reported from Newark and Chelsea J. Carter, from Atlanta. CNN's Denise Quan, Moni Basu, Melissa Gray, K.J. Matthews, Don Lemon, Phil Gast, Cathy Straight and Eden Pontz contributed to this report.","Whitney Houston laid to rest at Fairview Cemetery .

"(CNN) -- Two bones and and a driver's license with Steve Fossett's name have been found near the site where Fossett's plane crashed in eastern California, authorities said Thursday. Adventurer Steve Fossett, shown here in 2006, disappeared after a solo flight in 2007. The bones appear to be human, and DNA testing will determine whether they belong to the adventurer, Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said at a news conference. But Anderson said he believes ""our coroner's investigation is over and the Fossett family will finally have closure."" ""We talked to the family and advised them that we possibly, most likely, found the remains of J. Stephen Fossett,"" Anderson said. Searchers found ""two large bones,"" the driver's license, a pair of shoes and a $100 bill on Wednesday, Anderson said. The discovery site was a little more than a half-mile from where Fossett's plane wreckage was found on October 1 in a remote area of the Sierra Nevadas at an altitude of 10,000 feet.  Watch how the search yielded 'remains' » . The site of Wednesday's discovery also is about a quarter-mile from where a hiker reported finding aviation identification cards with Fossett's name and $1,000 in cash in late September, Anderson said. Fossett was last seen on the morning of September 3, 2007, when he took off from the Flying-M Ranch outside Minden, Nevada. He was scouting locations for an attempt to break the land speed record in a rocket-propelled car. Animal chew marks were found on the driver's license and the shoes, Anderson said. He said the marks indicate that ""animals possibly [moved] the body."" Previous DNA tests on what were believed to be bone fragments at and near the crash site showed that the fragments weren't human remains, Anderson said. Before this week's discovery, Anderson said, officials could not be certain that Fossett was dead. ""We could not categorically state that Steve Fossett perished in that crash because the only conclusive evidence our department had were those two aviation identification cards and $1,000 in cash,"" the sheriff said in a written statement. The National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating the wreck. Fossett made his money in the financial services industry but became renowned for his daredevil exploits. Fossett was the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon, in 2002, and the first to fly a plane around the world solo without refueling three years later. He also set world records in round-the-world sailing and cross-country skiing.","""We possibly, most likely, found the remains of J. Stephen Fossett,"" sheriff says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Maria Shriver cited ""irreconcilable differences"" in a petition filed Friday to dissolve her 25-year marriage to former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The move comes more than a month after Schwarzenegger acknowledged that he fathered a child outside of his marriage. The couple announced their separation on May 9, calling it a mutual decision made ""after a great deal of thought, reflection, discussion, and prayer."" It became clear a week later that the split was triggered by Schwarzenegger's revelation to his wife that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. ""After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,"" Schwarzenegger said in a statement May 17. ""I understand and deserve the feelings of anger and disappointment among my friends and family."" Shriver, in a written statement that same day, described it as ""a painful and heartbreaking time."" ""As a mother, my concern is for the children,"" she said. ""I ask for compassion, respect and privacy as my children and I try to rebuild our lives and heal. I will have no further comment."" It was confirmed several days later that a son fathered by Schwarzenegger with his housekeeper was born less than a week after Shriver gave birth to Schwarzenegger's son, Christopher, who is now 13. Shriver's signature on the divorce papers is dated June 18, but her lawyer filed them with the Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday. Shriver's petition proposed that she and Schwarzenegger share joint custody of their two minor sons, Patrick, 17, and Christopher. They also have two adult daughters, Katherine and Christina. The date of their separation was listed as ""to be determined."" The filing did not detail the assets to be divided between Shriver and Schwarzenegger . ""There are community and quasi-community assets and obligations of the parties, the exact nature and extent of which are unknown to petitioner at this time,"" Shriver's petition said.

"Sevare, Mali (CNN) -- The Malian military gained control Monday of the central Mali town of Diabaly, a key advance in the battle against Islamist militants in the north. The country's forces retook the town without ground assistance from the French troops in the country, a military spokesman said Sunday. The French military confirmed that it provided only air support. The French are involved in the fight because Mali once was under the country's control and because Islamists have been threatening to turn the democracy into a haven for international terrorists. Ethnic Tuaregs who had returned to Mali well-armed from fighting for late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi staged a military coup last year against the Malian government. Islamic extremists capitalized on the chaos, carved out a large haven in Mali's north and imposed a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The Islamists banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines. Those events stoked fear among global security experts that Mali could become a new hub for terrorism. And recent events regarding Mali have unfolding in harrowing ways. Mali is allowing France to use its airspace to take on insurgents, a move that purportedly angered militants, prompting some to storm a gas field in eastern Algeria and take hostages. That ended Saturday with 23 hostages dead and dozens of Islamist militants killed. On Monday, French officials said Malian forces pushed the Islamists into the forest beyond Diabaly and have taken control of the city and another area, Douentza. A CNN crew was in Diabaly Monday and were told by Malian and French forces that Islamists left after they were hit directly in one of their makeshift camps by the French and Malians. The scene after one battle included burned-out armored vehicles and a truck that at one point belonged to the Islamists. A Malian officer, Col. Seydou Sogoba, told CNN that the Islamists were using sophisticated weapons like he had never seen before. He believes they originated in Libya. As the news crew drove into town, the dusty streets in the extremely poor area were mostly empty except for military vehicles and French and Malian troops. Whatever trucks had belonged to the Islamist rebels were bombed and burned out. Destroyed high-caliber weapons were seen in the vehicles. A French colonel, exhausted from fighting and who wished not to be named, told CNN that foreign fighters -- including some who are Algerian -- have been pushed out of the area. Sogoba told CNN the fight against the rebels was very hard, but he is focused on ""preserving the national integrity"" of Mali. The humanitarian crisis in Mali is stark, according to the Norwegian Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. ""They cannot stay where they are due to the grave insecurity caused by the conflict,"" said Sebastian Albuja, the center's head of the Africa and Americas Department. ""Yet the meager resources and the diminished coping abilities of the government and humanitarian actors means that they are faced with limited options."" Because Algeria has closed its borders, people in the north are increasingly heading to the desert, where they will face harsh conditions and real struggles over food and water with limited humanitarian assistance, the group said. Many are fleeing on foot because they can't afford boats or buses, Albuja said, and even if they do make it, they get there only to find the roads blocked. The group is especially concerned about women, children and the injured, who they've heard are too afraid to go to hospitals, believing hospitals will be bombed. The Norwegian center is very concerned about victims of rape as a weapon of war, he said. French involvement began the day after militants said January 10 that they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali. Paris-Match interviews Belmoktar . On Monday, the website of the French magazine Paris-Match published an interview with the spokesman for Moktar Belmoktar, the veteran jihadist behind the Algeria attack, who said the attack was ""a 90% success because we managed to reach a strategic site protected by 800 soldiers with only 40 men."" France's ""crusaders and Zionist Jews will have to pay for its attack on the Muslims of northern Mali,"" said the spokesman, Hacen Ould Khalil. ""I hope France realizes that there will be dozens of Mohammed Merahs and Khaled Kelkal(s)."" Merah, believed to be a French national of Algerian descent, said he was a self-styled al Qaeda-trained jihadist. He was the chief suspect in a series of shootings, including an attack on a Jewish school, in France in 2012. He was killed in a police raid. Kelkal was of Algerian origin and is believed responsible for a series of attacks on French soil in the 1990s. The spokesman told the magazine that his group has contacted the French authorities and started negotiations. ""The goal was never to kill or hurt the hostages,"" he added. Then he explained what al Qaeda-linked militants in the Sahara want: . The end of the French intervention in Mali; the liberation of Omar Abdel-Rahman, ""the blind sheikh"" incarcerated in the United States for his role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombings; and the freeing of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani scientist who is incarcerated in the United States on terrorism charges. France denies any communication with Belmoktar's group, according to the publication. Read more: Six reasons events in Mali matter . France sending more troops? In recent weeks, French President Francois Hollande has said that if his country had not intervened, Mali ""probably would have fallen into the hands of terrorists."" Now 3,150 French soldiers have been assigned to the French mission, dubbed Operation Serval. At least 2,150 of them are on Malian territory, the French have said. The government is considering sending more troops, it said Monday. The Islamists are well-equipped and well-trained, French officials have said. But advances made by the Malian army toward cities that the Islamists previously controlled ""constitutes a certain military success for the Bamako government and for French forces,"" said French Defense Minister Jean-Yves le Drian. ""I reaffirm my total confidence in our soldiers who are in combat with determination in the mission decided by the French president."" he said. ""It aims to restore sovereignty to Mali on its territory and to prevent the risk of the constitution of a terrorist sanctuary in the heart of Africa."" Gunfire heard . Rebel control over Diabaly was one of the chief concerns to Mali and France as they tried to stop the Islamists' movement into the south. French and Malian forces retook Konna from militants Friday, a French source said. But gunfire could still be heard there on Monday. What's behind the instability in Mali? As fighting continues, many people are being cut off and are in need of basic supplies. The U.N. Security Council in December authorized the deployment of an African-led International Support Mission in Mali, and West African leaders met Saturday in Ivory Coast to discuss speeding up deployment of troops. The regional bloc -- the Economic Community Of West African States -- has said it has 3,300 regional troops on standby. It urged the United Nations to provide immediate logistical and financial support for African troops. ""The escalation of conflict in recent days reminds us of the importance of assuming our responsibilities very quickly in a dynamic of coordination with our partners,"" said Charles Koffi Diby, the Ivory Coast foreign minister. ""We should act very quickly."" 'It was absolutely necessary' Despite its unilateral decision to get involved, France is seeking help from its regional allies and the international community. Christian Rouyer, French ambassador to Mali, reiterated the need for the French offensive in Mali. ""We had a friendly country that was on the verge of dying,"" Rouyer said Friday. ""It was absolutely necessary to act with urgency. We did it, I believe, with full knowledge of the reasons."" Leaders from several countries have offered troops or logistical support. The European Union has approved a training mission. Canada and Britain are deploying military transport aircraft. Nigeria is set to deploy soldiers as part of the U.N.-mandated African force to fight the insurgents. No military aid from U.S. U.S. policy prohibits direct military aid to Mali because the fledgling government is the result of a coup. No support can go to the Malian military directly until leaders are chosen through an election, said Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman. So far, the United States has only shared intelligence from intercepted signals and satellites with France, defense officials said. U.S. trainers will be in African nations to prepare forces set to be deployed in Mali. Trainers will be in Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Togo and Ghana. The United Nations is warning of a record number of Malians fleeing to neighboring nations. The violence could soon displace up to 700,000 in the country and around the region, said Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency.","A humanitarian group says many injured fear going to hospitals .

"Washington (CNN) -- Leading American Muslims on Wednesday strongly criticized this week's planned congressional hearing into the alleged radicalization of members of their community, calling it an unfair attack on loyal citizens and a dangerous break from the traditional U.S. embrace of tolerance and pluralism. Rep. Peter King, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has said Thursday's hearing is necessary to explore the extent to which al Qaeda is trying to influence and indoctrinate U.S. Muslims, among other things. But his plans have created an uproar, with critics accusing Republican leaders of bigotry and comparing the hearings to Sen. Joseph McCarthy's allegations of Communist infiltration in the early years of the Cold War. American Muslim leaders have also taken issue with King's assertion that they haven't sufficiently cooperated with law enforcement officials, and dismissed his claim that the overwhelming majority of mosques are run by extremist imams. Such claims are ""demonstrably false,"" said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). ""Except for a tiny minority,"" extremists have found ""no fertile ground in America,"" he said. He said King is engaged in ""fear-mongering,"" and called the New York Republican ""unfit"" to head the Homeland Security Committee. ""We are not in denial as a community that something is going on, that there are bad actors in every community,"" said Imam Johari Abdul-Malik, a member of the Council of Muslim Organizations.  King is ""onto something, but he is going in the wrong direction."" And Attorney General Eric Holder weighed in as well, disputing King's premise that Islamic leaders haven't done enough to help police during a news conference Wednesday afternoon. Holder said the Justice Department has tried to establish a dialogue with American Muslims, ""so that information flows to us, information flows from us."" And he warned against doing anything to ""alienate entire communities."" ""Leaders of the Muslim community and the Muslim community itself have contributed significantly to the resolution of many of the things that we have resolved over the course of the last 12 to 18 months,"" Holder said. ""Tips that we have received, information that has been shared, has been critical to our efforts to disrupting plots that otherwise might have occurred."" In an interview with CNN, King shot back, ""That's not my experience."" ""New York is the epicenter, and I'm not aware of any tips that have been given in Nassau, Suffolk [counties] or New York City,"" he said. ""That's one. And then talking to officials around the country, I get the same complaints."" Holder has not been called to testify in King's hearings, because he would contradict those complaints, King acknowledged. And he said top Obama administration officials also say al Qaeda is attempting to radicalize American Muslims, so ""Where else would we look?"" ""I won't demonize anyone,"" he said. ""We're going to show the threat is coming from certain elements and in many ways threatens Muslim Americans as much as it does the entire country."" But Shahid Buttar, executive director of the Bill of Rights Defense Committee, said King is more interested in ""scoring cheap political points by vilifying vulnerable communities."" On Tuesday, a national group, Muslim Advocate, launched a website aimed at tracking what it calls anti-Muslim rhetoric, particularly among elected officials. ""Our concern is that the King hearings are going to sow fear and mistrust of the Muslim community at a time when the nation needs to be coming together,"" said Farhana Khera, executive director of the group that launched WhatUnites.Us. ""It's essentially a congressional stamp of approval for anti-Muslim hate."" In an earlier interview on CNN's ""American Morning,"" King promised a ""thoughtful, meaningful, very fair hearing"" and insisted he was not condemning Islam as a religion or American Muslims as a group. ""I would never question anyone's religious beliefs,"" he said.  ""The overwhelming majority of Muslims are outstanding patriots.""  But he added, ""There is a very small percentage who have allied themselves with al Qaeda,"" and he said U.S. Muslim leaders ""do not face up to that reality."" ""I want to encourage people in the Muslim community ... to be more aggressive in choosing their leaders,"" he said. ""I don't think the leadership right now -- groups such as CAIR -- are doing an adequate job.  I think in some ways doing a very poor job of representing the Muslim-American community."" CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper dismissed King's criticism, telling CNN the congressman ""doesn't like that CAIR criticizes his past anti-Muslim statements and his Keystone Cops hearing."" Some critics of the hearings have called King's efforts against Islamic-American terrorism hypocritical. In the 1980s, King, an Irish-American, was an active supporter of the Irish Republican Army, an organization the State Department then deemed a terror group, and Gerry Adams, the leader of the IRA's political wing. The IRA was responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths in terror attacks. But King, however, has defended his efforts, calling the IRA ""a legitimate force"" for decades. The congressman has insisted he only got involved so heavily with Adams because he knew Adams would be willing to broker peace with the British government. A January 2010 study from researchers at Duke and the University of North Carolina concluded that the threat stemming from radicalized Muslims is overblown. In the eight years following the September 11, 2001, attacks, 139 Muslim-Americans engaged in terrorism-related violence or were prosecuted for terrorism-related offenses with violent elements, the researchers concluded.  That level -- roughly 17 individuals per year -- ""is small compared to other violent crime in America, but not insignificant."" ""Homegrown terrorism is a serious, but limited, problem,"" they asserted. The report concluded that effective self-policing, denunciations of terrorism, and heightened political engagement were among the factors helping to minimize radicalization in the Muslim-American community. Critics such as King, however, point to a number of recent examples of alleged homegrown terrorism as evidence of a dangerous trend, including the case of Army Maj. Nidal Hassan, a psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009. Hassan had been in contact with militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico and preached at a mosque in Virginia before leaving the United States for Yemen. Last April, New York taxi driver Zarein Ahmedzay pleaded guilty to involvement in a 2009 plot to blow up crowded subway trains.  Prosecutors said Ahmedzay conspired with another man -- Najibullah Zazi -- who also pleaded guity and cooperated with authorities. According to a recent study from the New America Foundation and Syracuse University, the number of cases of American citizens or residents charged with or convicted of taking part in terrorist activities has jumped in recent years.  There were 76 such cases in 2009 and 2010 -- nearly half the total since September 11, 2001. But Muslim-Americans have played a key role in stopping such plots, noted Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst.  More than 20 percent of post-9/11 Islamist terror cases in the United States began with tips from Muslim community members or involved cooperation from the family members of alleged plotters, he said. Frank Cilluffo, director of George Washington University's Homeland Security Policy Institute, told CNN Wednesday that the threat of radicalized Americans ""continues to metastasize (and) comes in varies shapes, sizes, and forms."" ""To suggest that we don't face a threat is wrong,"" Cilluffo noted.  ""But to look for a single profile, unfortunately that doesn't exist right now."" CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Alan Silverleib, Dana Bash, Mike Ahlers, and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","NEW: Holder says hearings shouldn't ""alienate entire communities""

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz. It is the worst oil spill in U.S. history, and it happened exactly one year ago. That story leads off this Wednesday edition of CNN Student News. First Up: A Year Later . AZUZ: Blowout preventer, top kill, containment dome. A year ago, most of us had never heard of those terms. But they became part of our everyday lives as we watched the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico unfold. It started on April 20, 2010, with this explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. 11 of the 126 workers on the rig were killed in the explosion. The situation got worse when officials realized that oil was leaking directly out of the well and into the Gulf. Several early attempts to plug that leak completely failed. That left this: a sheen that stretched across parts of the Gulf of Mexico. When a reporter dipped his glove into the water, as you see on your screen right there, you can see just how thick the oil was. Two weeks after the explosion on the rig, the oil reached shore, coating miles of beaches all along the U.S. Gulf Coast and having a devastating impact on local wildlife. Eventually, engineers were able to seal the well and stop the leak, but not before more than 200 million gallons of oil got out. Check out what David Mattingly found when he journeyed back to the Gulf Coast one year after the spill. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAVID MATTINGLY, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Louisiana officials are watching their worst predictions come true. BP oil spill damage to some sensitive marshes may be permanent. Are these marshes done for? GARRET GRAVES, COASTAL PROTECTION AND RESTORATION: This area is likely going to be open water in a few years. MATTINGLY: This is what this 40-acre section of marsh looked like when the oil hit last May. The syrupy crude I saw floating on the water then was just the beginning of the problem. GRAVES: It's wiped out the birds that used to be here. It's wiped out the fish, the shellfish, everything in this area. MATTINGLY: Returning 10 months later, the Louisiana governor's office gave me an exclusive and disturbing look inside this damaged ecosystem. I could still see oil everywhere, sticking to the plants. It's like tar. So sticky. Look at that. It's also saturated the fragile soil. You can find it a foot below the surface. Right down here. Yes, it's down into the roots. Look at that. It's like a paste. And Louisiana officials still look at all this oily black and see red. This confrontation was in December as parish President Billy Nungesser accused the Coast Guard of not doing enough to speed the clean up. After months of study, the Coast Guard now tells me digging out the oil in some areas will do more harm than good. CAPTAIN JAMES HANZALIK, U.S. COAST GUARD: You can actually go in, you can trample oil into the marsh, where it would make it even worse than what it would have been if you would have just left it alone. MATTINGLY: But letting nature take its course could mean watching more of these vanishing marshes wash away. GRAVES: We're losing and trying to prevent the loss of... MATTINGLY: Wait a minute. The wind just shifted. Do you know what I smell? It smells like freshly poured asphalt. GRAVES: It does. MATTINGLY: And there's fear that the oil we see in the marshes is only a fraction of what's here. There's oil underwater, too. This is how most people find submerged oil out here. It looks clean right now, but not for long. Hit it. Watch what happens as a couple of quick spins from our airboat churns up the sediment below and releases the hidden oil. That's not mud we're looking at, is it? Within seconds, a telltale sheen begins to form, a reminder that the losses suffered in this spill are far from over. So, as long as this oil is here, it's just going to keep killing anything that tries to live here. GRAVES: It's going to keep killing, and you're going to have the birds who are going to come back and get re-oiled and they'll go fly somewhere else. And so, yes, the impacts are going to continue. MATTINGLY: And that, officials say, could go on for decades. (END VIDEO) Columbine Remembered . AZUZ: This day in history also marks the anniversary of a tragic event that took place in Littleton, Colorado. On April 20, 1999, a shooting happened at Columbine High School. 13 people were killed; 23 others were wounded. The two shooters eventually killed themselves as well. The attack shocked the country. Former President Bill Clinton described it as ""a day that changed us forever."" This memorial to the victims of the shooting was unveiled at a park near Columbine High School in 2007. Just the Facts . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the Facts! The war in Afghanistan started in 2001 following the September 11th terrorist attacks on the U.S. A U.S.-led coalition removed Afghanistan's Taliban leaders from power. Taliban fighters eventually regrouped and are battling coalition forces to this day. There are currently around 100,000 U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan. Threat of Insurgents . AZUZ: The U.S. is scheduled to start pulling some of those troops out of Afghanistan later this year. But Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said that the pace of the withdrawal will depend on the conditions in Afghanistan. Right now, coalition forces are facing a new threat in their fight against the Taliban. Barbara Starr explains. (BEGIN VIDEO) BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: U.S. and Afghan forces in the remote mountains of eastern Afghanistan. Six U.S. troops lost their lives here trying to dislodge the Taliban and protect local citizens. But it's the threat of insurgents wearing Afghan uniforms and attacking once secure areas that is increasingly worrisome. Former Afghan war commander, retired Lieutenant General David Barno, says the Taliban are getting ready for a U.S. withdrawal. LIEUTENANT GENERAL DAVID BARNO, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED): Their approach is not only to try and find ways to get inside the wire, as it were, to kill Americans, but also to suddenly undermine psychologically American confidence in their Afghan counterparts. STARR: On Monday, a man wearing an Afghan army uniform entered the secure compound of the Defense Ministry and opened fire, killing two. Five U.S. soldiers were killed Saturday when a suicide bomber wearing an Afghan military uniform struck a military base. On Friday, the Kandahar police chief was killed by a suicide bomber wearing a military uniform. U.S. military officials say civilians still suffer most from the suicide attacks. In February and March of 2010, insurgents killed or injured 82 Afghan civilians. This year it was 353, a 330% jump. But Barno warns U.S. troops shouldn't feel too secure. BARNO: We have felt in the past if we were inside of our bases and if we were working with our Afghan counterparts, that we were relatively secure. And I think that this whole strategy now puts that into question. STARR: The U.S. military is now training Afghan units in basic counterintelligence so they can try to find infiltrators in army and police units before they attack. Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon.

Is it: A) Greek, B) Farsi, C) German or D) Latin? You've got three seconds -- GO! We'll volunteer that the correct answer is Latin. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Volunteer Month . AZUZ: April is Volunteer Month, a time when many Americans help others out without asking for a thing in return. Last year, more than 60 million Americans donated their time and efforts to a variety of causes. Many of you wrote on our blog that your schools are raising money for Japan. But you can find ways to make a difference right in your home town as well! CNN's ""Impact Your World"" program has a challenge for you. For 2011, they're looking for 11 hours of volunteer time, hoping to get a total of 111,000 hours by the end of the year. Impact Your World . AZUZ: There are lots of ways to volunteer, and the ""Impact Your World"" site can help you find some of them. If you do volunteer, we'd love to hear about it. Take along a video camera; shoot an iReport for us. You can find a link to the ""Impact Your World"" page and one that explains how to submit an iReport at CNNStudentNews.com. Before We Go . AZUZ: The finish line is almost in sight. So, on your mark... get set... ... sit down! It's the annual office chair race in a town in Germany. Organizers say all you need to compete are strong legs and a good chair. A helmet's probably a good idea, too, especially since you'll be navigating ramps and jumps on your way downhill. More than 60 people took part in the races. Sure, it's kinda popular now. But the first guy to try steering a work chair down a hill? Goodbye . AZUZ:  He was totally office rocker. If you get money for finishing first, we hope the winner donates it to chair-ity. That just kinda seems right for this kind of sit-uation. We hope you can stand more puns, because there are more coming tomorrow. See you then.","Look back at a devastating oil spill that started exactly one year ago .

"(CNN) -- Hast thou been patterning thy parlance to evoke the vernacular of William Shakespeare? William Shakespeare is being honored in Chicago and on the Web on the 445th anniversary of his birth. Well, get thee to an Internet machine hastily, sirrah or mistress, for thou hast but two days from Tuesday to unleash thy inner bard. Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, Illinois, has declared Thursday as ""Talk Like Shakespeare Day"" to celebrate the 445th birthday of the man many consider the greatest playwright in the English language. While the bard's actual birth date is not known for sure, many scholars think it was April 23, 1564. In a proclamation issued last week, Daley encouraged city residents to ""screw their courage to the sticking place and celebrate Shakespeare by vocal acclamation of his words."" There's no reason why the rest of the country cannot play along, peppering our conversation with -- as the mayor suggested -- phrases such as ""prithee"" and ""fie!"" or, if you're at work, ""pass yonder stapler."" It isn't as difficult as it sounds. After all, Shakespeare single-handedly contributed more than 1,700 words and phrases to the English language -- everything from ""foul play"" to ""monumental"" to, of course, ""all's well that ends well."" But should you need some help, head over to talklikeshakespeare.org -- a Web site that the Chicago Shakespeare Theater unveiled Monday. Here, visitors can share their ""Shakespeariences"" -- their first memory of Shakespeare or their favorite quotes; subscribe to a Twitter feed where the Bard of Avon will generously translate your 21st-century English into its 16th-century equivalent; or listen to the Q Brothers singing about the finer points of speaking Shakespearean.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has issued a posthumous apology for the ""appalling"" treatment of Alan Turing, the British code-breaker who was chemically castrated for being gay. A portrait of Alan Turing is currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery's ""Gay Icons"" exhibition. The apology came after more than 30,000 people signed an online petition on the UK Government Web site calling for the government to recognize the ""tragic consequences of prejudice that ended this man's life and career."" Turing was just 41 years old when he committed suicide, two years after undergoing a court-ordered chemical castration. He had been found guilty of gross indecency for having a homosexual relationship. The punishment in 1952 was either a prison sentence or chemical castration. Turing chose the latter. In a statement on the British Government Web site, Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged Turing's ""outstanding"" contribution during World War II. ""He truly was one of those individuals we can point to whose unique contribution helped to turn the tide of war,"" he wrote, adding, ""The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying, therefore, that he was treated so inhumanely."" Turing is considered one of Britain's greatest mathematicians, a genius who is credited with inventing the Bombe, a code-breaking machine that deciphered messages encoded by German Enigma machines during World War II. He went on to develop the Turing machine, a theory that automatic computation cannot solve all mathematical problems, which is considered the basis of modern computing. Last month, the curious lack of public recognition for Turing's contribution to the war effort and computing in general motivated computer programmer John Graham-Cumming to campaign on his behalf. The author of the ""Geek Atlas,"" a travel guide for technology enthusiasts, started an online petition, and soon attracted high-profile signatories including scientist Richard Dawkins, actor Stephen Fry, author Ian McEwan and philosopher A.C. Grayling. ""I was surprised by both the number of people who signed and the fast response from the government,"" Graham-Cumming told CNN. He said the Prime Minister had called him personally to relay news of the apology. Stories about calls for a British apology were carried in newspapers in France, Switzerland, Spain, Austria, Portugal Poland and the Czech Republic. Supporters set up an international petition which attracted more than 10,000 signatures.","Online petition calling for apology for Alan Turing elicits response from UK PM .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Like the alchemists who once tried to turn lead into gold, a green entrepreneur says he has found a cost-effective method for turning plastic trash into oil. The Envion plant turns plastic garbage into oil by isolating petroleum from the plastic's other ingredients. During a recent visit to his new demonstration plant in Maryland, Envion CEO Michael Han describes his process: Waste plastic is shredded and melted and then processed in a way that separates the petroleum from the rest of the ingredients. At one end of the machinery, shredded plastic trash is dumped in a hopper and goes up a conveyor belt into a ""reactor."" At the other end is a spaghetti of pipes and valves and tanks. Han turns open a spigot on one of the pipes and produces a liquid the color of apple juice. It smells kind of like diesel, and Han claims it's ready to be processed for any number of uses: fueling cars, diesel generators or even jets. But not all of the ingredients in plastic can be refined into petroleum. All the chemicals that were added when the plastic was produced must be separated out and collected in a sediment tank. That could be a problem, says Kert Davies, a researcher with the environmental group Greenpeace. He has not visited the plant, but after reading Envion's literature, he asked, ""what happens to the additives and the metals and the other things?"" Envion is hoping to find asphalt makers who can use the sludge as an ingredient for paving after the metals are filtered out. Otherwise, it can be dried by microwaving and the dust sent to a landfill. ""Then you end up with a different problem,"" Davies said. ""Is that going to a hazardous waste landfill?"" But Han says that it's not hazardous, and most important, that the process releases no gas into the air. ""You don't smell anything burning,"" he said. ""We don't incinerate. We simply melt."" Han set up his demonstration at the Montgomery County dump in Maryland. Amid bales of crushed yogurt containers and plastic bottles, there seems to be little risk that he will run out of trash to feed into his machine. Envion is pitching the technology to sanitation departments, promising it will cut down on their trash volume by consuming up to 10,000 tons of plastic per year while producing some revenue as well. The plant could produce up to 60,000 barrels of oil a year, Han says, and although some of that oil is used to keep the machinery running, the rest can be sold to an oil company for profit. The plant cost $4 million to build, but Han says it can produce oil for as little as $10 a barrel at a time when oil is selling for more than $70 a barrel. Davies said that ""finding new oil to burn is not the goal. The goal should be to burn less oil."" But Han said, ""if there's a way that we can solve the problem of accumulation of waste plastic in our country and at the same time turn it into a byproduct that is cost effective, then I think it's a win-win situation."" CNN's Brian Todd contributed to this report .","Green entrepreneur says he's found safe, inexpensive way to turn plastic into oil .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Hundreds of French workers, angry about proposed layoffs at a Caterpillar factory, were holding executives of the company hostage Tuesday, a spokesman for the workers said. Caterpillar's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs. It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said. About 500 employees were also outside the building protesting. A top Caterpillar executive called the hostage-taking unhelpful. ""The actions that are taking place today, led by a small minority of individuals, are not helping as we work for a positive resolution of this situation,"" said Chris Schena, Caterpillar vice president with responsibility for manufacturing operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, in a statement. ""The best way to resolve this matter is to continue the negotiations through the Works Council to find a solution that's fair to our employees and allows Caterpillar to remain a leader in a rapidly changing global marketplace,"" Schena said, adding that the company was ""concerned for the safety of our employees."" Benoit said all the workers wanted to do was negotiate with Caterpillar and they were upset that the company did not show up to two earlier scheduled negotiating sessions. The employees being held in their office were being allowed to get food, Benoit added. Police arrived at the scene two hours after the incident began but it had not been settled. Employees at a French 3M factory held a manager hostage for more than 24 hours Wednesday and Thursday of last week over a dispute about terms for laid-off staff. Luc Rousselet, who was unharmed, was allowed to leave the plant in Pithiviers, central France, early on Thursday morning after talks between unions and officials from 3M France. Earlier this month, the boss of Sony France was held overnight before workers freed him after he agreed to reopen talks on compensation when the factory closed. France has been hit by nationwide strikes twice in the past two months.","NEW: Workers release one of five people being held hostage at Caterpillar factory .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The recession is a good excuse for employers to introduce a pay freeze, but what if you think your hard work deserves greater financial reward? Four experts share their tips for getting a pay raise during the downturn. With a bit of luck, you could get a pay raise, even in the current economic climate. 1. Knowledge is power, so before you pursue a pay increase, do some research.""Compare your salary with that of your colleagues and with job adverts so you know the market salary for your position,"" says Sherridan Hughes, occupational psychologist with Career Analysts. 2. ""You need to justify a pay raise,"" says Corinne Mills, managing director of Personal Career Management. She says you need to show your boss that you are exceeding your job requirements. ""You need to demonstrate that you have brought in business or have taken on additional responsibility. Perhaps redundancies mean you have been doing the jobs of two people,"" says Mills. 3. Don't work harder for that pay increase, work smarter -- and work in line with the goals of management. So says Robert Weil, president of Institute for Coaching. ""Increased pay and bonuses go first to those who impact the bottom line or impact what is most important to management,"" he says. 4. Weil says you must make sure your actions and daily plan are aligned with your company goals. ""If the company, for example, wants more business from existing clients, then make sure you are putting all of your energy into that. If your company wants to cut costs, make sure you are doing that,"" he says. ""Think outside the box, get creative and be resourceful"". 5. It's not all bad news. David Randall, a career consultant with Career Energy, says that even in the depths of the downturn, some businesses are giving pay raises. ""Firms need talent and talent costs money -- if they don't pay then people will go elsewhere. That applies in large measure to executives, who are by definition talented,"" he says. Do you have any tips for getting a pay raise? Sound Off below . 6. Randall says that when you approach your boss for a raise you need to create a win-win deal for both of you. You should say that your goal is to have a higher salary and you want to know what to do to perform to a higher level that justifies that salary. ""It could be you can do that by working in a different way, by taking on more responsibility or by meeting certain targets that your manager can set,"" he says. ""Whatever it is, a deal can usually be worked out that will create the extra value to justify a pay increase."" 7. Ask nicely. Mills says it's important to discuss your request in a pre-arranged meeting. She says that even if your boss says no, they might be able to set a date for a pay review, perhaps in six months. If a date is set for a future review, confirm it in writing, even if it's just an email. 8. Remember, not all jobs are equal and not all are suffering from the downturn. Randall says, ""Businesses need to keep up with the state of labor market supply. In shortage areas they will have to pay people in order to retain them."" 9. It can seem extreme but sometimes threatening to leave is what it takes to make your boss realize your value to the company, says Hughes. But she adds, ""If you threaten to leave your job if you don't get a pay raise, you must be prepared to follow through with your threat."" 10. ""Manage expectation,"" says Mills. ""Times are tough and if it's not in your contract that you will get a salary raise each year, don't think you have an automatic right.""","Career advisors give tips on how to get a raise in the economic downturn .

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: An educational overhaul? That issue is first up in today's show. I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Education Reform . AZUZ: ""We cannot afford to let the relative decline of American education continue."" Those, the words of President Obama as he unveiled a proposal to overhaul the country's educational system. Some critics argue that the president is tackling too many issues, but Mr. Obama says America doesn't have the luxury to address one challenge at a time. This latest proposal touches on everything from test scores to teacher salaries to the amount of time you spend in school. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ: It's a five-pronged approach to reforming education in America, and President Obama says it would span from the cradle through career. First, he's calling for more spending on early childhood programs. For example, some first-time parents would get regular visits from nurses who'd check on kids and, the president says, help prepare them for school and life. Second, Mr. Obama wants to toughen and clarify testing standards. He believes schools have reacted to lower test scores by simply lowering expectations. To fight that, Obama wants funding for the ""No Child Left Behind"" program to be tied to results. Simply put: increase student performance, get more money. The third tier aims to recruit and train teachers. Money from the stimulus plan has been set aside to offset teacher layoffs. One controversial point though: Obama wants good teachers to get paid more. Teachers' unions and critics say that could cause school officials to play favorites. The unions also have a problem with this: Obama wants more charter schools, schools that don't answer to the local school board and have different approaches to education. The president wants to end limits on the number of these schools that states allow. But teachers' unions say charter schools take the money that public schools should get. And many teachers and students won't want to hear this: Obama wants longer school days and more of them. Why? U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom. AZUZ: Higher education comes fifth on this list: increasing Pell Grant awards. Also, giving a $2,500 tax credit per year to help working families with their students' college tuition. One goal: that the U.S. would have the world's highest proportion of college graduates by 2020. Thing is, the president can't make all this happen; his power is limited. So, we'll have to keep our eyes on states to see what they do in the days ahead. (END VIDEO CLIP) Blog Promo . AZUZ: So, a five-point proposal, but we're focusing on one that could have a direct impact on you: longer school days. You've heard the president's view - we want to hear yours! And teachers, you're invited too. Head to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com and tell us what you think. Financial Scandal . AZUZ: Following up on some financial news now. Bernard Madoff, the man accused of running a $50 billion Ponzi scheme, is expected to plead guilty to 11 criminal charges and he could go to jail for the rest of his life. Madoff, arrested late last year. Charged with scamming thousands of clients in a scheme that pays off early investors with money from new ones. Madoff is expected to enter his guilty plea tomorrow. If that happens, the judge says he'll sentence Madoff in several months. Shoutout . ERIC NIVISON, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Which of these countries is Afghanistan? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A, B, C or D? You've got three seconds -- GO! On this map, D is Afghanistan, a nation that's home to nearly 33 million people. Afghan Women at Risk . AZUZ: President Obama says he'll consider talking with some members of the Taliban to try and bring peace to Afghanistan. The militant group controlled the nation before being thrown out of power in 2001, and it was criticized for its harsh rule. A leading Afghan activist says any negotiations with the Taliban need to address the issue of women's rights. Carol Costello explores this topic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAROL COSTELLO, CNN REPORTER: It was America's promise to the women and girls of Afghanistan: empowerment after years of Taliban oppression. AFGHAN SCHOOLGIRL: The Taliban told us not to go to school. We were afraid because those who tried to learn were beaten. COSTELLO: Today, more than seven years after U.S. troops toppled the Taliban, the Afghan government says 2 million Afghan girls now go to school. But there is evidence the Taliban and the dark days are returning. Suraya Paksad provides shelter in Afghanistan for women and girls who are victims of violence. COSTELLO: Do many women still fear the Taliban? SURAYA PAKZAD, VOICE OF WOMEN ORGANIZATION: Yeah, even I feel fear sometimes because when I, when I receive death threats, when I'm going to the office, I don't use the same way that every day I'm going. I change the routes to go to the office. I cannot share my schedule even with my friends, with my staff, and even sometimes I'm not secure talking on phone. COSTELLO: Pakzad says violence against girls grows by the day. Four months ago, men on motorcycles used water pistols to spray acid on a group of girls walking to school. The incident was widely condemned, as were other Taliban-inspired acts against women, by America's new secretary of state. HILLARY CLINTON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE This is not culture. This is not custom. This is criminal. COSTELLO: Pakzad says Clinton's words brought a renewed optimism, which promptly dissipated when President Obama floated an idea to reach out to Taliban moderates to bring peace to Afghanistan. PAKZAD: This is a hard question for now. COSTELLO: She says if the Taliban is brought in, women's rights must be on the table. But as of Monday, there were no clear assurances from the state department. ROBERT WOOD, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: Well, I think you have to wait until our policy review is done before, you know, drawing any conclusions on anything. COSTELLO: Despite her worries, Pakzad will go back to Afghanistan with hope. PAKZAD: And I know when I see that you are enjoying your freedom in this beautiful country, and I know, I believe it doesn't come by itself. It was the result of hard work of a group of dedicated women that put their lives at risk. COSTELLO: The state department told us women's rights are important and to keep in mind this idea of using moderate elements of the Taliban is just that right now: an idea. Carol Costello, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO CLIP) I.D. Me! NIVISON: See if you can I.D. Me! I was born in Tibet in 1935. I assumed power as the Tibetan leader in 1950. I won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. I'm the Dalai Lama, and I've lived in exile, away from my home country, since 1959. Tibetan Chinese Relations . AZUZ: This month marks the 50th anniversary of when the Dalai Lama left Tibet during an uprising against the Chinese government. The spiritual leader says China has made life ""hell on Earth"" for Tibetans in the time since, but China blames the decades-long conflict on the Dalai Lama. Kristie Lu Stout traces the tense history between the two sides. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN REPORTER: The Potala Palace, a stunning landmark and symbol of Tibetan nationalism. It was also home to the spiritual leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama. But now, it's capped by the red flag of China. Let's step back in time to find out how this came to be. While the 20th century is still young, China's last emperor has been overthrown, rival warlords vie for power with a weak central government, and Tibet, which was nominally under Chinese rule during the last dynasty, declares its independence. In 1940, a five-year-old boy from a peasant family is enthroned as the latest reincarnation in a line of 13 previous Dalai Lamas, and venerated as the god-king ruler of Tibet. In 1950, having pacified China, the new communist government in Beijing turns its attention to this remote mountainous region. Its armies move on Lhasa. Chinese leader Mao Zedong offers automony but also demands obedience. Smiles for the cameras here, but back home, resentment against Chinese rule is brewing. And then, on March 10, 1959, violence erupts in Lhasa. A Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule fails. Exiles claim some 86,000 Tibetans are killed. After weeks of unrest, the Dalai Lama and his ministers flee Tibet and go into exile in northern India. They are soon joined by tens of thousands of followers. During decades of exile in Dharmasala, India, the Dalai Lama continues to press China to give autonomy to Tibet. He becomes a cause celebre in the west, but talks with Beijing never get anywhere. The run up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing sees another round of violence in Tibet. In March last year, angry Tibetan protesters take to the streets in Lhasa, targeting and even killing Han Chinese. Beijing responds with a brutal crackdown. This month, it's lockdown in Tibet. Foreigners are banned from entering, and security is intense. China isn't taking any chances. (END VIDEO CLIP) Before We Go .

"(CNN) Washington -- The nationwide retail pharmacy chain CVS has agreed to pay the federal and several state governments more than $17 million to settle claims the pharmacy overcharged Medicaid. CVS, with 7,000 pharmacies in 41 states, allegedly submitted inflated prescription claims in 10 states. The case against CVS was originally brought by a CVS whistleblower pharmacist in Minnesota. The government said that pharmacist will receive more than $2.5 million, which will come from what the states and the federal government recover from CVS. The federal government will receive nearly $8 million, and the 10 states will receive a total of $9.5 million. Those states are California, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada, Rhode Island, Alabama and Minnesota. Officials said CVS was paid a higher amount by Medicaid than it would have been paid if the company had followed correct billing procedures and submitted the claims to third-party insurers. ""Medicaid covers the poorest, most vulnerable people in American society. This needed government program for prescriptions is a disservice to everyone and won't be tolerated,"" said Daniel Levinson, inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CVS issued no immediate comment, but the Justice Department said the retailer agreed to three years of government monitoring as it implements correct billing procedures.","Pharmacy chain accused of inflating prescription claims in 10 states .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- We found him on a Sunday morning, as an outdoor service came to a close at what was once the Notre Dame cathedral. When the hymns faded, we picked through the carcass of the building, and there he was among the collapsed walls, his slender body framed by piles of rubble and blue sky attempting to peek through after a hard rain. In his arms, he cradled a child, not more than a year old. Her name, he said, is Christella. Christ is here. She was born, he told us, on January 12, 2010, just hours before Haiti's massive earthquake. His story was stunning, even in a place where everyone has a tale of survival. We immediately thought of it as symbolic of Haiti's struggle this past year -- to go on living despite extreme hardship. But it would not take long for doubt to creep in. It's difficult to believe people in the new world that is Port-au-Prince, where desperation prompts people to say anything if they think that it will bring them attention, and maybe help. Not that trust was ever in abundance here during decades of dictators and despots. But now people have very little documentation left of their lives, and journalists have little choice but to place some faith in what the subjects of their stories tell them. Many people we interviewed wanted payment, simply for answering our questions. It was not an agreement we could make. But we could understand the request, coming as it did in a place where meals are not routine, where grinding poverty has changed the rules of life. The grim anniversary of the earthquake has long passed. This week, the spotlight fell on Haiti for a different reason -- Michel Martelly was declared the winner of a troubled presidential election. But for the most part, international journalists, like us, have packed their bags and gone elsewhere. Some are in Japan, covering that nation's earthquake tragedy. But the story of the man in the rubble of the cathedral  still haunts. It is worth telling because it does epitomize something about Haiti: a new wave of misery in which truth, and deception, are both tools for survival. A tale of desperation, resilience . This much is known to be true: The man asked nothing of me or my CNN colleague Jim Spellman when we happened upon him. Only when we remarked on his situation did he say he wished he had a tent to shield his baby from the rain and milk to fill her aching belly. And this is the story he told. Christella was born on January 12, at 9 a.m., almost eight hours before the ground shook for 35 seconds and dismantled much of Port-au-Prince. His wife of five years, Carla Fleurival, gave birth in a small shelter they called home in the shadows of the cathedral. In all his 23 years, he has known nothing but poverty of the most extreme kind. When he was 3, his mother brought him with her from Leogane to beg in the big city. He grew to manhood while living on the streets of Port-au-Prince. He had hoped for a different life for his own 3-year-old son, Christopher, and now, Christella. Clinton returns to help in ongoing recovery . Then the Cathédrale Notre-Dame de L'Assomption came tumbling down. Dust billowed everywhere as enormous chunks of plaster and concrete roared like an avalanche, flattening everything in its path. Instantly, Carla was crushed to death. She was buried with about 30 others behind the cathedral. The man's friend, Marie Batiste, was cooking rice and beans on a small wooden stove. It toppled over and the hot water scalded Christella. The father scooped her up and ran with her to the general hospital. As he talked, he showed us the scars on the baby's right leg. These days, he enters the broken cathedral to shelter his baby from the searing sun, to seek refuge in the very building that wrought death in his family. Sometimes, he peddles for change from the foreigners who visit. He depends on the charity of others, he said. He began believing that everything that befell him was God's will. He has no money. When he finds food, he said, he feels guilty that he gives most of it to his infant daughter. His son goes without -- for two, maybe three days. ""I don't even know how to take care of her,"" he said. ""I bathe her but I don't know how to braid her hair."" Single fatherhood is hard anywhere. Imagine the enormity of the task for a poor man in post-earthquake Haiti. He wiped tears away with his dust-caked hands. It was difficult not to be moved by his story. We photographed him, interviewed him further. But when we returned two days later, we were led to see him in a different light. Others cast doubt on his story. ""He is not telling you the truth,"" two men told us, indirectly, through our interpreter. ""He has a wife. He wants your money."" If that was his ultimate goal, he put up an elaborate ruse, hoping we would find him amid the rubble and pity him. And he'd never asked us for money. We made our way through the tents and plastic tarpaulins on the street near the cathedral, asking others who lived there about him. A blind man known for his guitar riffs and his willingness to talk to foreigners told us the story was true. So did Marie Batiste, the friend who was cooking that day and said she saw the quake throw water on the baby. Spellman and I believed the man's story. So did other journalists. The Miami Herald's Carl Juste photographed Christella and her father four months ago for the anniversary of the earthquake. ""I can only go by what he told me. I believe him,"" Juste told me. ""If someone is lying to you, you would sense it. No one told me he is lying."" So why would some try to discredit him? The man insisted he had not embellished his story. He said others accused him of lying because they were jealous. ""They all hate me because most often people who come to the cathedral give me money or food so that I can take care of the baby."" It is a sad fact that there is so much competition for attention in Haiti. That one man's need can be seen as another's threat. In an odd way, it matters little whether the man's story is true. The fact of his existence is real, as are the dire circumstances in which he lives. He is not just a metaphor for Haiti. He is a man. And I feel certain that if we return to the small city of tents and tarps that hug the cast-iron gates of the cathedral, we will find him there. He says his name is Fritz Robert Pierre-Saint. I believe this to be true.","Many people we interviewed wanted payment, simply for answering our questions .

"(CNN) -- With its past-midnight resolution (at least temporarily) of the fiscal cliff, Washington gave us a clearer picture of what the next two to four years of federal action might look like: Lengthy periods of legislative gridlock, persistent partisan finger-pointing and short bursts of incremental activity that ultimately fail to resolve the major national challenges at hand. And those challenges are substantial. Our country is still struggling to fully recover from the Great Recession. More than 12 million Americans are still out of work, and 107 million Americans are considered poor or near poor (up from 81 million a decade ago). The United States ranks 16th in the world in infrastructure quality, with one in four bridges in America considered structurally deficient. And our education system is no longer keeping our kids competitive, leaving 15-year-old American students ranked 31st in math and 23rd in science. But as has happened time and again throughout American history, our greatest innovations come at times of greatest challenge. True to form, inaction from the federal government has sparked the innovation of states, cities and metropolitan areas that are teeming with smart, pragmatic and bipartisan solutions to national economic challenges. For the second year in a row, we have identified our Top 10 State and Metropolitan Innovations to Watch -- actions undertaken by states and metropolitan areas in 2012 that seem ripe for meaningful impact in 2013 and beyond, as well as for replication by other communities. Many of these innovations represent grand economy and talent-shaping gestures. In San Antonio, for example, a ballot initiative to support pre-kindergarten education was passed in November, championed by Mayor Julian Castro and the local business and civic leadership. The referendum provides $31 million a year in new sales tax revenue to expand pre-k programs, with the goal of providing every eligible student in the city a strong start on the path to secondary and post-secondary success. Other large-scale initiatives include an Infrastructure Trust in Chicago to leverage private investment for the energy retrofit of public buildings, and the accelerated build-out of a state of the art transit system in Los Angeles -- a metropolis long known for its traffic congestion rather than transport alternatives. Most dangerous U.S. cities . Some innovations embody smaller, structural interventions. Florida Gov. Rick Scott's new Office of Freight Logistics and Passenger Operations will bring a multimodal approach to solving transportation and logistics challenges that have traditionally been addressed separately and inefficiently. Building on the state's decision to prioritize investments in the Port of Miami -- which alone carries 5% of U.S. trade with Latin America by value -- the office will be instrumental in ensuring the competitiveness of the state's large logistics sector by preparing for changing dynamics in global trade, such as the expansion of the Panama Canal. Other structural initiatives include an ambitious strategy in Portland, Oregon, to help small business and distinctive clusters of firms access global markets, and a new National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute in Youngstown, Ohio, to capitalize on opportunities brought by 3D printing. All of these innovations share common themes. They embrace a vision of economic growth that is productive, sustainable, inclusive and globally oriented. They are affirmative in spirit, forward-leaning in action and imaginative in design, reflecting the quintessential optimism that characterizes America. And, perhaps most importantly, they are shaped and advanced by networks of leaders who work across jurisdictional, ideological and, yes, political lines to get stuff done. But most of all, these innovations in policy and practices show that American-problem solving does not rely exclusively on the work of the federal government. If we can accomplish such extraordinary things at the state and local level, just imagine what we can accomplish as a nation if Washington gets it act together and even partially embodies this same innovative spirit. Hopefully, it won't take four years. * * * . Top 10 state and metro innovations to watch . Exports . Metro -- Portland, Oregon: Metropolitan Export Plan.

"(CNN) -- A jury convicted Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon on Tuesday of embezzlement for improperly using gift cards intended for the needy, the chief investigator for the state prosecutor's office said. She was found guilty of a single misdemeanor count of fraudulent misappropriation by a fiduciary. She could be removed from office because it is a theft-related crime, James I. Cabezas said. Dixon solicited several cards for her own use from two developers, including Patrick Turner, who testified this month that Dixon asked him to donate gift cards from retailers and have them delivered to her office. He said he spent $1,000 total -- $500 for a Best Buy gift card and $500 for a Target one, according to the Baltimore Sun newspaper. No date was set for sentencing. Cabezas said Dixon, Baltimore's first black female mayor, faces up to five years in prison. She was indicted in January. The 55-year-old mayor was acquitted of two counts of felony theft and one count of misconduct in office in connection to allegations that the Democrat misused gift cards sponsored by the mayor's office and to various stores. In a statement, Dixon said she would continue with her work. ""The jury's verdict today does not impact my responsibility to continue serving, and I remain focused on keeping Baltimore on course in these trying economic times,"" she said. Her spokesman, Scott Peterson, told CNN that the verdict was confusing, since she was also found not guilty of stealing the gift cards. ""I don't know how to deal with that,"" he said in a telephone interview. Jurors deliberated more than six days before reaching their verdict. A second trial is scheduled for March to address Dixon's alleged financial disclosure violations and perjuries, Cabezas said. ""The city will still continue to move forward. ... We won't miss a step,"" Dixon said outside the courthouse after the verdict. Turner ""has a significant development project in progress now,"" Cabezas said. The investigation into alleged wrongdoing at City Hall began in March 2006, when Dixon was on the City Council. Several other people related to the case already have been convicted, Cabezas said. Dixon was president of the City Council when she became mayor in January 2007, after then-Mayor Martin O'Malley was elected governor. She was serving a four-year term in November of that year.","Jury finds Mayor Sheila Dixon improperly used gift cards intended for the needy .

"(CNN) -- A man who lost a recent Social Security claim opened fire with a shotgun in a federal courthouse Monday, killing a court security officer and injuring a deputy U.S. marshal, authorities said. Law enforcement officials speaking on condition of anonymity identified the man as Johnny Wicks, a Las Vegas resident. The FBI said the black-clad man walked into the lobby of the Las Vegas federal courthouse, pulled a shotgun from underneath his jacket and began shooting. The shootout ended after federal marshals chased Wicks out of the courthouse and across the street, where he was shot and killed. He died among the bushes in front of an old school that once housed a temporary police headquarters. ""There had to be close to 40 gunshots, if not more,"" said Troy Saceal, who was parking in a garage near the courthouse when the shooting broke out. ""I started seeing officers coming down Las Vegas Boulevard actually shooting, and what looked to me as someone was hit up by the front of the building by gunfire."" A one-minute, 13-second video clip posted on the Web site YouTube includes at least 45 gunshots, many in rapid succession. Nicholas Gramenos, who recorded the clip, said he was leaving the courthouse when the shooting erupted. Another witness, Bobby Scottland, told CNN the shots ""sounded like popcorn."" He said he passed the suspected gunman shortly before the shooting broke out. ""He didn't look disturbed, from what I saw -- if that is the gentleman,"" Scottland said. ""You know, nothing would have given me a second thought that what was about to happen happened."" Wicks filed a discrimination claim against Social Security in 2008, alleging he was denied full benefits because of his race, according to court papers. A federal judge ruled against him in September. A law enforcement official said Wicks set fire to his residence before the shooting, and surveillance video indicates he was a lone gunman with no accomplices. The deputy marshal and the security officer were taken to a hospital, where the security officer, Stanley W. Cooper, died, said  U.S. Marshals spokesman Jeff Carter. Cooper, an employee of Akal Security, had been a contracted court security officer with the U.S. marshals in Las Vegas since 1994, Carter said. He spent 26 years with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. The deputy marshal, who was not named, was listed in stable condition; Dickey told reporters he was in ""good shape."" The nine-floor Lloyd D. George Federal Courthouse was evacuated after the shooting, which broke out about 8 a.m. (11 a.m. ET). Employees were let back into the building to get their belongings, but the building remained closed Monday afternoon. Cones were scattered across Las Vegas Boulevard on Monday evening, with each representing a slug or shell casing from the gun battle. The building also houses the local offices of Nevada Sens. John Ensign and Harry Reid. Neither senator was in the building at the time, although Ensign told reporters he went there upon hearing reports of the shootings. Ensign said it was his understanding the gunman never made it past security at the courthouse, saying the security there is ""outstanding."" The officer who died took a ""direct hit"" from the shotgun, he said, while the deputy marshal was shot in the arm. Reid, the Senate majority leader, issued a statement saying his thoughts were with the victims and their families. ""The law enforcement personnel who protect the courthouse put their lives at risk every day to keep the people who are inside safe, and I greatly appreciate their service,"" the senator said. U.S. Marshals Service director John F. Clark said in a statement, ""I can receive no news more grim or sobering than word of a line-of-duty death or injury to our U.S. Marshals personnel ... Rest assured, the brave and immediate actions of these two individuals saved lives by stopping the threat of a reckless and callous gunman who had no regard for who or how many victims were struck down by his senseless actions. They are heroes."" CNN's Ed Henry, Dana Bash, Lynn Lamanivong, Chuck Johnston, Sara Pratley and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect in shooting identified as Johnny Wicks, a Las Vegas resident .

"(CNN) -- The immigration debate took center stage Thursday as U.S. President Barack Obama fielded questions in a forum broadcast live online by the Spanish-language Univision network. ""I want you to acknowledge that you did not keep your promise,"" co-host Jorge Ramos said in Spanish, noting that the president didn't deliver on his 2008 campaign pledge to push immigration reform during the first year of his term. Obama said the first year of his term was consumed by efforts to help the economy and stop the country from going into another Great Depression. And Republican political opponents, he said, kept many significant immigration measures from getting off the ground. For immigrants, 'deferred status' still means no federal health insurance . ""I am happy to take responsibility for the fact that we didn't get it done,"" Obama said. ""But I did not make a promise that I would get everything done 100% when I was elected as president. What I promised was that I would work every single day as hard as I can to make sure that everybody in this country regardless of who they are, what they look like, where they come from, that they would have a fair shot at the American dream. And that promise I've kept."" Asked whether his move this summer to halt deportations of some children of illegal immigrants was politically motivated by a desire to win the Latino vote, Obama said, ""I think if you look at the polls, I was winning the Latino vote before that. ""I did this because I met young people all across the country, wonderful kids who sometimes were valedictorians, were participating in the community, had aspirations to go to college, some were serving in our military. ... There's no way you would think it was fair or just for us to have them suffering under a cloud of deportation,"" he said. After answering a series of Spanish questions about topics ranging from teacher strikes to Mexico's drug war, Obama brought up the topic again at the end of the forum. Asked by Ramos to identify his biggest failure, Obama offered a quick response. ""Jorge, as you remind me, my biggest failure is that we haven't gotten comprehensive immigration reform done,"" he said. ""But it's not for lack of trying or desire."" The hourlong forum, co-sponsored by Facebook, was broadcast live online in Spanish and English on Thursday afternoon and was scheduled to air on Univision later Thursday night. On the campaign trail, both Obama and Republican challenger Gov. Mitt Romney have discussed immigration in their efforts to woo Latino voters, considered a key demographic in the November election. Obama handily won the Latino vote in 2008 over Republican Sen. John McCain, and recent polls have showed Obama leading Romney among Latino registered voters. Romney steps up effort to woo Latino voters in Univision forum . The impreMedia/Latino Decisions weekly tracking poll reported Monday that Obama held a 68% to 26% advantage over Romney among Hispanics. A Gallup poll conducted partially before and partially after the Republican National Convention at the end of August said Obama leads Romney among Latino registered voters 64% to 27%. But Latino leaders have criticized the president for an overall increase in deportations of undocumented immigrants in recent years. Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency's history. Some Latino leaders have also criticized the president for not moving quickly enough on immigration reform at the beginning of his presidency. Obama: 'I need a dance partner on immigration reform' Politicians across party lines have vowed to fix what they argue is the nation's broken immigration system. But it's unclear what shape so-called comprehensive immigration reform could take -- particularly in a politically divided Congress. Many immigrant rights groups have proposed creating a ""path to citizenship"" that would give millions of illegal immigrants an opportunity to become legal residents. Critics have called such proposals unfair offers of amnesty to lawbreakers. Measures aimed at dealing with the thorny issue -- including the DREAM act, proposed by Democrats and backed by Obama -- have not gained enough support to pass Congress despite several attempts. The Obama administration has said its deferred action policy -- which allows people younger than 30 who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military, to apply for a two-year deferral from deportation -- is a temporary measure aimed at addressing a problem that requires a permanent solution. During the primary campaign, Romney said he opposed the DREAM Act, but also called for an unspecified GOP version that has yet to emerge from the party or his campaign. On Thursday, Obama said he had never wavered in his support for immigration reform and criticized Romney's stance on the topic. ""The issue here for voters is whose vision best represents the aspirations, not just of the Latino community, but of all Americans who believe that we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And that candidate I believe is talking to you right now,"" he said as the audience at the University of Miami cheered. Romney spoke for about 35 minutes in another ""Meet the Candidates"" forum hosted by Univision on Wednesday. The events come weeks after Ramos criticized the Commission on Presidential Debates for not picking a Latino debate moderator. ""I think that they should have noticed that this country is changing very rapidly,"" Ramos told CNN in August. ""Minorities, for instance, surpass whites in U.S. births, and those changes simply are not reflected. I really can't believe why they didn't choose a member of a minority group to be part of at least one debate, and I really can't understand why (the commission didn't pick) a journalist from the fastest (growing) voting block in the country, the Latinos."" The bipartisan commission that organizes presidential debates announced the moderators last month. PBS' Jim Lehrer will host the first debate on October 3 in Denver. Candy Crowley, CNN's chief political correspondent and host of ""State of the Union,"" will host the second debate on October 16 in Hempstead, New York, at Hofstra University. And CBS' Bob Schieffer will host an October 22 debate in Boca Raton, Florida. Univision presidential forums stocked with partisans .

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's the most awesome day of the week! Thank you for spending part of it with CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz. We're starting things off with a look at the headlines. First Up: Top Stories . AZUZ: President Obama is calling for a massive overhaul of the country's health care system. At a summit on the issue yesterday, he called rising medical costs ""one of the greatest threats"" to American families and to the U.S. economy. An estimated 46 million Americans currently don't have health insurance. Among the changes he's pushing for, President Obama wants to create a health care reserve fund that would help move the country closer to universal coverage. Former First Lady Barbara Bush is expected to make a full recovery following heart surgery earlier this week. The wife of the 41st president and mother of the 43rd was diagnosed with the heart condition less than a week before Wednesday's operation. Doctors say the procedure went smoothly and they expect Mrs. Bush to be out of the hospital in about a week. And Wall Street is back on that roller coaster ride. After gaining a bit on Wednesday, the Dow Jones headed in the opposite direction yesterday. The economic indicator dropped 281 points and finished the day at its lowest level since 1997. Word to the Wise . ERIC NIVISON, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... earmark (noun) in a legislative bill, an earmark is something that is set aside for a specific use . source: www.dictionary.com . Wasteful Spending? AZUZ: There's a bill making its way through Congress right now that includes more than 8,000 earmarks! The president of a group called Taxpayers for Common Sense says these things aren't necessarily good or bad, it's the process that's problematic. President Obama has vowed to cut down on earmarks and wasteful spending, and as Jason Carroll tells us, he's not the first president to try. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON CARROLL, CNN REPORTER: One might think Democrats and Republicans don't have much in common, but they do: a shared history of wasteful government spending. Remember the '80s and those military contracts that had the government shelling out $435 dollars for a hammer, $640 for a toilet seat? That type of spending stopped, but over the years, the waste has not. BRIAN RIEDL, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Every president since Ronald Reagan has promised his own crackdown on waste, fraud and abuse, and none have been particularly successful. CARROLL: True, promises have been made. FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: So, let us work together to reform the budget process and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half. CARROLL: Presidents have tried to carve the fat when they found it. FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: There was $1 million to study stress in plants, and $12 million for a tick removal program that didn't work. CARROLL: Now, it's President Obama's turn. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The American people's money must be spent to advance their priorities, not to line the pockets of contractors or to maintain projects that don't work. CARROLL: Even as the president has promised to save taxpayers $40 billion a year, the stop-gap spending bill currently making its way through Congress has come under attack for having the same type of wasteful spending president Obama wants to eliminate. According to the citizens watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, it includes nearly $1.8 million for pig odor research in Iowa, another million for cricket control in Utah. President Obama says his plan will save taxpayers money by not outsourcing services the government can do, ending no-bid contracts that have led to abuses in the past, and strengthing oversight to help maximize accountability. But still, some consumer groups and critics question what incentive there is in President Obama's plan for lawmakers to change their old ways. TOM SCHATZ, CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE: It's a full-time job requiring the attention of every secretary and every appointee and every agency, because the individuals that are involved in those systems don't always have an incentive to change them . (END VIDEO CLIP) Pet Benefits . AZUZ: Shifting now from politics to pets. If you've been pushing your parents to get you a dog or cat, you might want to show them this next report. Pet owners do a lot for their animals. But according to some scientists, those furry friends are doing something good for us, too: improving our health! Judy Fortin dives into the details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDY FORTIN, CNN HEALTH REPOTER: People tend to dote on their pets. They groom them, even dress them, and spend a lot of time walking them. JENNIFER ECKERSON, PET OWNER: We walk 5, 6, 7 days a week, 30 minutes every day at least. FORTIN: Jennifer Eckerson's dog Rosco gets her up and out of bed almost every morning. Dr. Edward Creagan says owning a pet can be a prescription for good health. DR. EDWARD CREAGAN, MAYO CLINIC ONCOLOGIST: Many times, I will put on a prescription pad: one cat, one dog, indefinite refills. FORTIN: Creagan adds there is evidence to back the claims. CREAGON: Studies have shown that individuals who have pets have lower blood pressure, they have a decrease in a stress hormone which is called cortisol, and they have a higher level in their blood stream of feel-good hormones. FORTIN: Creagan says companionship is good for everyone. ECKERSON: He doesn't know if you've had a bad day, he doesn't know, uh, he's just happy to see you no matter what. FORTIN: Unconditional love with the added benefit of good health. Yet another reason to enjoy the company of man's, or in this case, woman's best friend. (END VIDEO CLIP) Blog Report .

AZUZ: March is Women's History Month. We're celebrating the event on our show and online. You can check out our One-Sheet and Learning Activities at CNNStudentNews.com. To kick off our coverage, we're looking back a couple decades to honor some famous firsts from the 1980s, starting with one of the women we mentioned in that Shoutout. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS:  Sandra Day O'Connor is known for her sharp questioning from the bench, especially when she served for 24 years as justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. At the height of her career as a judge, President Ronald Reagan nominated her to fill an open seat on the nation's highest court, and in September 1981, O'Connor was sworn in as its first female justice. O'Connor attended Stanford University, as did Sally Ride. But it was Ride who received her undergraduate and doctorate degrees in physics. While studying for her Ph.D in 1978, Ride was selected for the NASA astronaut training program. On June 18, 1983, she became the first American woman in space, an experience she later described as ""the most fun I'll ever have in my life."" Back on Earth, Joan Benoit Samuelson gained stardom as a pioneer of women's marathoning. She won the Boston Marathon in 1979 and again four years later. But in 1984, at the age of 26, Samuelson became the first woman to win a gold medal in an Olympic marathon. A year later, she received a prestigious award as the nation's finest amateur athlete. Another noted female athlete is Ann Bancroft. Her rise to stardom came from her passion for the wilderness. After 56 days by sled and on foot, Bancroft and her teammates arrived at the North Pole in 1986. But Bancroft was the first woman to do it. And she led the first American women's team on the 660-mile expedition to the South Pole. Honoring achievements from the 1980s this Women's History Month. (END VIDEO CLIP) Before We Go .

"(CNN) -- Days after launching a manhunt along highways and online for the so-called East Coast Rapist, Connecticut police on Friday took into custody a man they claim is behind sexual assaults on at least 17 women in four states. The U.S. Marshal's Fugitive Task Force arrested Aaron Thomas, 39, without incident at his home in New Haven, according to a press release from that city's police department. There was no indication that he had been charged, though the statement did say he ""has been identified as the East Coast Rapist."" Early this week, six local law enforcement agencies, the FBI and the Department of Justice launched a joint website -- using the domain EastCoastRapist.com -- to solicit information from the public about a man they called a ""brazen, cold-blooded rapist."" The website alleges that DNA evidence links a man to four attacks in Prince George's County, Maryland (between 1997 and 2001); Fairfax County, Virginia (between 1999 and 2001); Leesburg, Virginia (in 2001); Cranston, Rhode Island (in 2006); New Haven (in 2007); and Prince William County, Virginia (in 2009). It has police sketches of the suspect, from the various locales. First Sgt. Kim Chinn, a spokeswoman for the Prince William County Police Department, told CNN affiliate WJLA that collective work of a recently formed multi-agency task force and ""an anonymous tip in the past few days"" helped spur the investigation this week. ""As soon as he was identified, things did happen quickly,"" said Chinn. ""We are all breathing a sigh of relief."" CNN's Anna Gonzalez contributed to this report.","U.S. Marshals arrest Aaron Thomas, 39, without incident at his home in New Haven .

"(EW.com) -- There's no replacing Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis as the original ""Ghostbusters,"" but if you were staging a one-night-only live version of the classic comedy, well ... whom might one contact? Seth Rogen, Jack Black, and Rainn Wilson are going to cross the streams. The event is one of the monthly live-reads of a famous movie script organized by ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air"" filmmaker Jason Reitman, who â€” of course â€” has a family connection to this story. His father, Ivan Reitman, directed ""Ghostbusters"" and he remembers hanging around on the set as a little kid. But even he was surprised when he went back and looked at the original script of the movie for Thursday night's reading at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. COLLECT ALL 4 HOBBIT COVERS: When you subscribe to EW! It turns out, Murray was making it all up as he went along. ""While almost all of the dialogue in original screenplay is echoed on screen, the Venkman character is completely improvised. It's as if Bill Murray was given a mumblecore-style essay about each scene and then permitted to say whatever he wanted as long as he got the point across,"" Reitman tells EW. ""He slimed me"" is in the script, but not the follow-up line: ""I feel so funky."" And remember Venkman's magician act? It's not in the script. ""He's like a jazz musician who knows, 'I have eight measures here and have to hit this note here and as long as I follow those rules everything else is up to me,'"" Reitman says. Did that drive his father crazy? Reitman laughs and says: ""This was his third movie with Bill. They'd made Meatballs, and done Stripes together. He was already familiar with those improvisation skills."" In creating the script for the Film Independent live-read this week, Reitman's father got him the original script, as well as a transcription of the finished movie. He found himself adding many of the improvisations to the page, while still trying to preserve some of the original lines, which have never been heard before. ""Every important Venkman line is back in there, and there are about 30 of those,"" Reitman says. ""You can't have Ghostbusters without 'We came, we saw, we kicked its ass.'"" It's not just the memorable one-liners that Murray added. ""It's the strange nuances,"" Reitman notes. ""For example, Venkman goes to meet [Sigourney Weaver's] Dana at Lincoln Center and she's talking to a man. As he walks away, Venkman goes, 'I'm sorry you and I didn't get more of a chance to chat!' He expresses vulnerability and ego in a way that is kind of impossible to write."" That leads us to Reitman's choices on the live event's casting: . Seth Rogen as Peter Venkman . ""It's the most crucial and tricky piece of casting. I knew we needed an actor whose rhythms were equally unique to Bill Murray's and had that kind of a swagger."" Jack Black as Ray Stantz . ""When you think about Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz, you think about this positive enthusiasm and energy. No one has that like Jack Black."" Rainn Wilson as Egon Spengler . ""As originated by Harold Ramis, this part needs someone with an earnest, scientific mind and clear-cut decisive humor."" The role of Winston Zeddmore, originated by Ernie Hudson, will be played by comedian and voice actor Phil LaMarr, best known for the role of Marvin in ""Pulp Fiction."" (Yeah, poor, shot-in-the-face Marvin.) Weaver's role of Dana Barrett, a.k.a. The Gatekeeper will be played by Kristen Bell, while Kevin Pollak will play both the mayor of New York City and the fussy EPA idiot Walter ""This man has no dâ€”k"" Peck. ""Larry King and Casey Kasem both lent their voices to the original film, and Kevin does great impressions of both of them,"" Reitman adds. Mae Whitman of Parenthood will take over the role of the ""Ghostbusters'"" receptionist Janine Melnitz, originated by Annie Potts, while Paul Rust (Inglourious Basterds, I Love You Beth Cooper) will perform the Rick Moranis part of Louis ""The Keymaster"" Tully. Paul Scheer will fill out the rest of the cast with such roles as the guy taking the psychic test at the beginning of the film -- and being mercilessly electrocuted by Venkman. Reitman has previously staged Film Independent LACMA live-reads of ""The Apartment,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""The Breakfast Club,"" but this is the first time he has done one of his father's films. ""It was a part of my life growing up. I just thought it would be fun,"" the younger Reitman says. ""I have one of the original Ghostbuster guns in my house. That is the one thing they want to see, and want to take a photo with. I understand the energy around that film. To me it's similar to The Princess Bride live-read we did last year. People have a relationship with the film that goes beyond normal movies.""

"(CNN) -- Women at two Kansas colleges are on edge after warnings that the same man may have raped 13 women at the schools in the last eight years. Kansas Attorney General Steve Six says each victim has described her attacker in a similar way. The University of Kansas and Kansas State University have alerted students to possible danger for those who stay in town during spring break, which starts Monday. Thirteen rapes have happened during breaks in the school year in the last eight years near the colleges. Eight happened near Kansas State University in Manhattan. Five happened about 85 miles away, in Lawrence, where the University of Kansas is located. Investigators say the same person may be responsible for all 13 rapes. Students like Carly Wagner, a senior at Kansas State, are taking precautions. She said she and her roommates already make sure to look out for each other. ""None of us ever walk alone at night. We go pick each other up or make sure that there's no case where you have to be alone at night,"" she told CNN affiliate WIBW. The Kansas attorney general, Steve Six, said Wednesday that similarities in the attacks lead investigators to believe they may be looking for the same person. Those similarities include ""the age of the victims, the location of the rapes in off-campus housing"" and ""the fact they occurred during breaks in the school session."" In addition, each victim has described her attacker in a similar way. Investigators are looking for a white man in his twenties of average height and weight. He has also been reported to have covered his face during the attacks, Six said. The University of Kansas sent an e-mail to students Monday warning those staying on campus for spring break. ""If staying in Lawrence, students should take reasonable precautions, as some reported sexual assaults and other crimes have occurred during breaks,"" read the warning, which did not refer specifically to the past rapes. The University of Kansas also posted recommendations on its Web site, including checking locks on home and apartment doors, walking in groups and knowing the location of campus emergency buttons. The specific dangers during college breaks have been on the university's radar for some time, says Jill Jess, a university spokeswoman. Before winter break, the university offered free self-defense classes to students as a result of the past attacks, she said. Kansas State warned its students, faculty and staff of the past attacks in an e-mail last month. It was the second e-mail that campus officials have sent out in recent years regarding the rapes. ""It's scary to walk around campus or be on a college campus not knowing at night what goes on and who can be around,"" one student told CNN affiliate KTKA. The Kansas State Women's Center has also been working diligently over the past year to make students aware of the rapes, said Mary Todd, the center director. She has worked with some of the victims and has learned from their accounts that there was often no sign of forced entry. This has led her to believe the attacker entered residences during the day, when a lot of students feel safe leaving doors unlocked. By emphasizing such details, she said, the center hopes students will keep their doors locked. The Women's Center and a group called Wildcats Against Rape have distributed pamphlets at campus buildings as well as several off-campus locations. The attorney general's office warned the entire community Wednesday. ""We encourage women to be safe, but we encourage everybody in the community to also look out,"" Six said. ""Look out for your friends, call if you see something suspicious and just be vigilant during the spring break time.""","Police believe same person may be responsible for 13 rapes .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN)  -- Yoshiko Sato would love to give her only son a brother or a sister. But money struggles and Japan's cost of living have pushed the mother to wait. Japanese mother Yoshiko Sato says the proposal ""would help us with a second child."" A proposal to pay parents about $3,400 a year per child has got her thinking seriously about expanding her family. The cash for kids plan is the brainchild of the country's new ruling Democratic Party of Japan, which came into power during the elections this week. The proposal has garnered supporters and critics. ""It would help us with a second child,"" Sato said. The proposal would pay families the money every year until the child reached high school. It is an effort to boost Japan's birthrate, which is one of the lowest in the world and is a major drag on the country's economy. It is compounded by Japan's rapidly aging population. About a quarter of the country's population is older than 65, according to government figures. By 2050, that number is expected to reach 40 percent.  Watch as some parents ponder procreation » . Nevertheless, the money for babies proposal has its critics. Economist Yuri Okina said she wonders where Japan's government is going to come up with the money to fund it. The plan is not an instant fix, she said. What's needed, Okina said, is a way for women to remain in the work force after having children instead of being forced out because of lack of child care. ""We have to make it normal in Japan for a woman to raise a child and have a career,"" Okina said. Critics also have said the plan would not fix a significant problem for working families -- the lack of day care centers. About 40,000 children are on waiting lists for day care, according to government figures. These facilities' scarcity is problematic for mothers such as Hiromi Espineli. ""Going back to work would be tough,"" she said, ""since there are so few day care centers.""","New ruling party proposes to pay parents about $3,400 a year per child .

"(CNN) -- Former Vice President Al Gore will not face prosecution on an allegation of sexual assault from 2006. The allegation, brought forth by Molly Hagerty, claims Gore sexually abused her during a professional massage at the Hotel Lucia in Portland on October 24, 2006. CNN policy is to not name the alleged victim in a sexual abuse case, unless the person has come forward publicly to the media. Hagerty told her story to the National Enquirer. The Portland Police Bureau did not recommend prosecution ""due to a lack of credible evidence,"" according to the Multnomah County district attorney's office. ""After evaluating the materials submitted by PPB I have concluded that I agree with the assessment that a sustainable criminal case does not exist,"" Senior Deputy District Attorney Don Rees wrote in a memo Friday. ""Ms. Hagerty's detailed statement ... is insufficient to support a criminal charge given other contradictory evidence, conflicting witness statements, credibility issues, lack of forensic evidence and denials by Mr. Gore."" Gore's office in Nashville, Tennessee, released a statement saying the former vice president was pleased with the finding. ""Mr. Gore unequivocally and emphatically denied this accusation when he first learned of its existence three years ago,"" the statement reads. ""He respects and appreciates the thorough and professional work of the Portland authorities and is pleased that this matter has now been resolved."" An attorney for Hagerty did not immediately return a call for comment. According to the district attorney's office, Portland police first became aware of the allegations in December 2006, when Hagerty's attorney said his client had been subjected to ""unwanted sexual contact"" by Gore. After a series of canceled meetings with investigators, Hagerty's attorney told police the matter would be handled strictly as a civil case and no police complaint would be filed. After Hagerty's allegations were published in the National Enquirer this summer, Portland police opened a full investigation, Rees wrote. Portland police submitted their findings to the district attorney's office on Tuesday and did not recommend prosecution. The district attorney's office noted several deficiencies in the case: . ""Ms. Hagerty, who has red hair, states she called Mr. Gore immediately following the alleged incident and told him to 'dream of redheaded women' seemingly in contradiction to her assertions that she was terrified of Mr. Gore,"" Rees wrote. The DA's office also said Hagerty did not provide medical records she claimed were related to the case, despite repeated requests. Rees also wrote that Hagerty failed a polygraph examination and was apparently paid by the National Enquirer for her story.","District attorney's office cites numerous ""deficiencies"" in the alleged victim's case .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's prosecutor general, appointed to the job just last month by President Mohamed Morsy, gave into demands of lower prosecutors by agreeing to resign next week. The protesters converged on the prosecuting general's office at the High Court Sunday, refusing to leave until Talaat Abdallah resigned. The siege by the prosecutors ended Monday when Abdallah signed a resignation letter that was then read to reporters. The letter will be delivered to Egypt's Supreme Judicial Council on December 23, the prosecutor's office said. Read more: Islamists claim victory in first round of referendum . The prosecutors objected to Abdallah's appointment by Morsy because of his connection with the Muslim Brotherhood. They became angry when Abdallah replaced attorney generals with judges affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. The latest flare up happened last week when Abdallah transferred Attorney General Mostafa Khater, who had freed defendants arrested by Morsy supporters during clashes outside the presidential palace on December 5.

"(CNN) -- The thing about North Korea is that once in a while, it does something that sends the international community into a flurry of talk about the hermit nation, even though little is known about what's really going on. This week, Pyongyang fired a long-range Unha-3 rocket and sent a satellite into orbit. Nervous world leaders quivered as the rogue country defied a United Nations ban on developing nuclear- and missile-related technology. Was the world a more dangerous place after Wednesday's event? What would it mean for North Korea's young leader as he is about to mark the first anniversary of the death of his father, Kim Jong Il? When the son ascended to power, concerns surfaced over an inexperienced, mysterious heir taking charge of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, its hardcore and cultish communist society and a population of the hungry. His eldest half brother said in his book that he was concerned Kim Jong Un would fail to satisfy North Koreans. Now, the new ""Dear Leader"" can claim not just a public relations victory but also a tangible accomplishment as he prepared for Monday's anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death. Amid the dearth of information, one thing was clear: Kim Jong Un can now stand proud before his people on that big day. ""The question is what does Kim Jong Un intend? said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York. ""It's been an interesting first year but as with most things in North Korea, we simply don't know,"" he said. Few nuclear experts saw the launch as a tremendous technological advancement, but the perceptions were great and gave Kim a big boost in clout. He can say he fulfilled a promise that has kept his family dynasty in power for decades; that the nation's persistence to move on -- despite international isolation and internal hardship -- has paid off. In that sense, the satellite launch was proof of progress and power, said Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who traveled to North Korea in 2010. ""He wants to show his people after one year in leadership, North Korea is a strong military, technological, space, nuclear power (with) nuclear weapons,"" Richardson said. ""I think that was partly to shore up the military, to shore up his support,"" he said. James Schoff, a North Korea specialist with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed. ""I think this is very important to Kim Jong Un to build political legitimacy and bolster the spirits of his people,"" he said. ""He is doing this despite the fact that he knows he is going to come into a lot of criticism in the region for it."" The launch was a continuation of Kim Jong Un's father's project and it was important to achieve success days ahead of the death anniversary, especially after a failed rocket launch in April. That launch had been timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of founding leader Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. ""Then, it was a major embarrassment,"" said Han Park, director of the University of Georgia's Center for the Study of Global Issues who was in North Korea at the time of the failed launch. ""So they tried to rectify that. ""This is a tremendous psychological boost vis-a-vis the South,"" Park said referring to the fact that South Korea has not yet put a satellite in space. North Korea's ruling politburo is sure to spin the story as national dreams coming to fruition under the initiative of Kim, Park said. Sure enough, the state-run news agency KCNA said the launch was ""a desire at the behest"" of Kim. ""All the people across the country are greatly excited at the news of the successful launch and progressives are extending sincere congratulations to them,"" it said. The sentiment was echoed at a snow-dusted celebratory rally Friday. ""The successful launch was the result of Kim's ""unique will, courage and boldness,"" said Jang Chol, head of the State Academy of Sciences. The rocket launch allows Kim to establish military security for North Korea, said Park, and allows him to move forward with another priority: economic progress. ""This is an important game changer,"" Park said. Park, who has been visiting North Korea for decades, said conditions for ordinary North Koreans remain bleak, though there is not the mass starvation the country suffered in the 1990s. ""Kim Jong Un's primary objective is to improve the economy by participating in the international market,"" Park said. That's a feat that is not possible without U.S. cooperation. ""So he realized he has to improve relations with the outside world,"" Park said. ""In the big scheme of things, Kim Jong Un must have thought that North Korea would be taken more seriously (after a rocket launch)."" Sigal said Kim has been consolidating his power for some time by sacking unwanted people from his Cabinet. ""Purge is too strong a word but there have been all sorts of changes,"" Sigal said. ""That's telling me that this guy is taking charge and setting up for economic policy changes. Kim Jong Un staked his personal prestige on economic growth."" Sigal warned that at the moment, there were no signs of any economic changes. Park, however, said he could see some evidence of the North Koreans boosting agricultural production, building hydraulic power plants and other infrastructure and inviting foreign investors. The Chinese, in particular, have taken advantage of that, Park said. Sigal agreed that Kim Jong Un has shown signs that he wants to stimulate economic growth but the problem is that means he has to make a change from his father's military-first policy that devoted billions of dollars into weapons development. ""The question is does he have the political muscle and the political will to do that?"" Sigal said. ""He has certainly positioned himself to do that.""In the world's most totalitarian state, it's difficult to predict the future. But the rocket launch this week certainly cast the spotlight back on the enigmatic nation and served as a reminder to global powers that the North Korean problem isn't just going to slither sway. ""He's saying to the world, 'Look, I'm back,'"" Richardson said about Kim Jong Un. ""You can't keep me off the headlines. I have to be dealt with. This is the capability I have."" Richardson believes the main message this week has to be that the United States and the four other countries that have been involved in talks with North Korea -- China, Japan, South Korea and Russia -- have to come up with a new approach in their dealings with Pyongyang. ""These guys are serious; they've got missiles now,"" Richardson said. ""It's uncertain about the new leader,"" he said. ""I'm disappointed, because I thought maybe there's a positive political opening with him."" Maybe there still is. Sigal said the only way to get what Washington wants on the nuclear front is to come to the table. It's also the only way to know more about North Korea. Sigal likes to say that there is only one thing tougher than negotiating. And that's not negotiating.

"(CNN) -- The Drug Enforcement Administration is investigating the company that owned the plane that crashed this week, killing music star Jenni Rivera and six others, the agency said Friday. Court records that surfaced after Sunday's fatal crash revealed that the aviation company, Starwood Management, had two planes authorities seized this year. The company remains under investigation, DEA spokeswoman Lisa Webb Johnson said. Read more: Jenni Rivera's remains returned to family . The planes in question were seized in February in Arizona and in September in Texas. The DEA declined to give further details, citing the ongoing investigation. Some indications of why the planes were seized became known through court records. Read more: Jenni Rivera's plane plunged from 28,000 feet, Mexican official says . Insurance firms QBE and Commerce & Industry Insurance Co. filed suits this year seeking to rescind contracts with Starwood Management, alleging falsehoods. The lawsuits against Starwood focus on the man who signed the insurance paperwork on its behalf, Ed Nunez. Nunez is also known as Christian Esquino, the insurance companies allege, a businessman with a criminal record that includes falsifying airplane records. The DEA confirmed Friday the link between Starwood and Esquino. In another court action, Starwood distances itself from Esquino and denies he is the owner. Starwood had one plane, a Hawker 700, confiscated by U.S. marshals acting on behalf of the DEA in September once it landed in McAllen, Texas, after arriving from Mexico, according to one of the insurance company lawsuits. Read more: Rivera crash puts spotlight on charter jet safety . In February, marshals seized a Starwood Gulfstream G-1159A in Tucson, Arizona, that lawsuit said. Starwood or its representatives have not responded to repeated requests for comments about the plane that crashed with Rivera or the DEA investigations. Rivera was a Mexican-American star with a rising cross-border appeal. She sang traditional Mexican ballads and was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in 2002 in the category of best banda album. Born in Long Beach, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Rivera, 43, released her debut album in 1999. In October, People en Espanol named Rivera to its list of the 25 most powerful women. The singer was also known for her tumultuous personal life. She was a single mom at age 15, was married three times and the mother of five, her website said. Rivera's ""I Love Jenni"" reality show began airing on Telemundo's mun2 network last year.","The company that owns the plane that crashed, killing Jenni Rivera, faces DEA probe .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The Cherokee Nation had difficulty electing its principal chief, so much so that members called in the Carter Center to observe the most recent vote and judge whether it was free and fair. We normally observe elections only in politically troubled countries abroad but believe that the contentiousness and fundamental voting rights issues at stake -- and not just for the Cherokees -- justified this exceptional mission. Simmering beneath the election process all along has been the crucial issue of voting rights for the former slaves known in the tribe as Freedmen, who are Cherokee citizens of African origin and who have had to fight in the courts to be able to vote. Cherokees, formerly of Georgia and now mostly in Oklahoma, number about 300,000, 56,000 of whom are registered voters. About 15,200 turned out for an election in June. After four attempts to certify the winner in the contest between incumbent Principal Chief Chad Smith and challenger Bill John Baker, the Cherokee Supreme Court set a rerun vote vote for September 24, which the Carter Center observed. In March 2007, a referendum â€” in which only 8,700 ballots were cast -- denied tribal citizenship to anyone who did not have at least one ancestor on the 1867 U.S. government's Dawes List of ethnic Cherokees. Most of the disenfranchised were the nearly 3,000 Cherokee Freedmen. U.S. authorities had deemed their ancestors not ethnic Cherokees but among the 5,000 survivors of the 17,000 expelled from Georgia and sent on the ""Trail of Tears"" to Oklahoma. Dawes had listed them separately as full members of the Cherokee nation. The Freedmen defied the exclusion, claimed their full rights and voted in June. But in August, before the rerun, the Cherokee Supreme Court issued a second ruling, affirming that the March referendum was constitutional. Smith had championed the 2007 referendum and, not surprisingly, praised the affirmation of Supreme Court, whose members he had appointed. Because of that, many believed the court ruling was rooted more in political opportunism -- to assure more votes for Smith over Baker -- than legal principles. The Freedmen fought back. Their legal counsel appealed to Washington District Judge Henry Kennedy to stay the Cherokee Supreme Court ruling September 20, and this, along with a decision by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to freeze $31 million in much-needed housing funds, succeeded in restoring the Freedmen's voting rights in the September 24 runoff. When the Cherokee Nation appealed to The Carter Center to observe this election, we saw a likelihood of another very close election between two increasingly bitter factions competing for control of a Cherokee administration with rapidly growing assets: up 243% since 2002, mostly because of casino gambling. Last year, the administration had revenues of about $420 million. But what made this election far more significant than a contest for political power and wealth was the voting rights of the Freedmen. Democracy's defining principle is inherent equality. The terrible history of forced oppression and forced relocation has produced a deeply flawed Cherokee democracy, one further threatened by the attempt to restrict citizenship to ethnic Cherokees, a flagrant affront to the principle of inherent equality. We observed the voting September 24 and the additional five days allowed at the election commission's headquarters in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, with the final voting October 8. The elections commission declared Bill John Baker the winner in an election The Carter Center deemed to be transparent and an accurate reflection of the will of the Cherokee people, including the Freedmen. The Cherokee election is significant because the vote was credible, and more important, for the rejection of ethnic nationalism as a route to democratic development. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Stremlau.","John Stremlau: Cherokee Nation called in Carter Center to observe its election for chief .

"(EW.com) -- The American Film Institute has thrown an awards lifeline to ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The group doesn't choose a best picture, it only ranks the 10 best movies of the year and lists them alphabetically, and this year's list could easily mirror the eventual best-picture field for the Academy Awards. The six locks for a nomination â€” ""Argo,"" ""Les Miserables,"" ""Life of Pi,"" ""Lincoln,"" ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" â€” are all on AFI's list. But the Oscars could select anywhere from five to 10 nominees, and with so many worthy contenders this year the list is likely to go long. So could AFI's choices be a good gauge for what might fill those other four slots? If you're Christopher Nolan, you've got to hope so. When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expanded its best picture field three years ago, it was in part due to the feeling that ""The Dark Knight"" was best-picture worthy, but fell just short. Including more movies, including pop favorites like that one, was seen as a way to excite more viewers about the telecast. L.A. and Boston critics hand out awards . But so far, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" hasn't generated the same awards heat. It's in the conversation, for sure, but this is also a stellar year for films and competition is fierce. Among the other movies jockeying for a slot on the best picture list are ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" and ""Django Unchained"" â€” which are also on AFI's list. The choice by the AFI jury, made up of scholars, and film and TV professions, to include ""The Dark Knight Rises"" gives that movie a much-needed jolt of adrenaline in the awards race. Oscar voters are certainly aware of the film, and Nolan and company have been out campaigning for it a lot lately, but the AFI mention should remind those Academy members to give it some consideration for best of the year.

"(CNN) -- If you plan on watching the Super Bowl Sunday, there is one aspect of the game that can be predicted with absolute certainty: . You'll be bombarded with instant replays so continuously that you'll stop noticing they're there. I'm not referring to the occasional replays that determine whether an official on the field has made the right call. Those usually come at dramatic junctures. The instant replays that will wash over you are the routine ones we've all become accustomed to in every televised sport: the rebroadcast, usually in slow motion, of the play that has just occurred. The block that cleared the way for a 30-yard gain, the catch made in traffic just before the defenders level a receiver ... we take it on faith that as soon as a play has ended, we'll likely see it from a different angle again (and again ... and again). A case can be made that instant replays, while an enjoyable tool for watching sporting events, have worked their way into the wider nonsporting world in ways that are far from beneficial. In the context of the streets and homes of the United States, they are not an unmixed blessing. There was a time when instant replay had never been seen by American sports fans. If you watched a game on television, you had to pay pretty close attention. If you missed the touchdown run, the buzzer-beating basket, you weren't going to see it again before the game concluded. This made for a lot of dead air between plays. Then, on Dec. 7, 1963, during the Army-Navy football game, a CBS sports director named Tony Verna, using newly available videotape technology, showed an Army touchdown for a second time right after the runner crossed the goal line. Broadcast lore has it that play-by-play announcer Lindsey Nelson, not wanting viewers to be confused, yelled into his microphone: ""This is not live! Ladies and gentlemen, Army did not score again!"" What happened in the ensuing years, you know about. Instant replay became an integral part of sports broadcasts. If a game were to be telecast today without instant replays, it would appear incomplete and unsatisfying. Viewers would become frustrated. As instant replay became so ubiquitous on sports telecasts, a subtle shift occurred in everyday life. We had become used to seeing everything that transpired on athletic fields shown over and over; if we didn't see the big play the first time, it didn't matter, because we knew we'd be seeing it again right away. And before long, we began to demand the same thing from life itself. Technology obliged. Instant replay capability became available to all of us. The ramifications of this, it can be argued, have turned out to be complicated and less than ideal. Moments have ceased to be momentary. Life has turned into dress rehearsal. First came home-video cameras; people at family gatherings began to pop the tapes into VHS playback machines as the parties were still in progress, reliving celebratory toasts while the guests still had the drinks in their hands, scrutinizing themselves on screens before memories had even begun to form. Camera phones took this into new territory; every person with a phone became as powerful as Tony Verna in that CBS control room, able without delay to immediately transmit moving pictures to networks of acquaintances, or to public video-posting sites, for viewing by anyone in the world. On one level it's a marvelous development, endlessly fascinating. Yet there is this nagging feeling that real life has been converted into a series of moments that are no longer expected to be here and gone, but instead are regarded as first run-throughs: performances that will be witnessed repeatedly, on demand. When you habitually view the world through the lens of a digital camera, knowing that it will take only seconds for you to transform something that has not yet happened into something that, in theory, will live forever, you inadvertently are accomplishing something else: You are altering, devaluing, the meaning of ""now."" We cease paying quite so much attention to what's taking place around us, to savoring it, because we have become conditioned to believe that there is nothing that won't come around again in rerun -- probably within minutes. Knowing that the odds are slim that if we miss something we'll really miss it, we don't focus as sharply. The replay, paradoxically, seems more authentic than the original act. There's no going back; Tony Verna may or may not have been aware of what he started during that Army-Navy game in 1963, but what commenced that day was the beginning of the end of the concept of here-and-gone. Security cameras are mounted in so many places today that, on city streets and in stores and office buildings, you're on stage more constantly than Milton Berle or Lucille Ball ever were in the early days of television. Your every movement is being recorded just as precisely and diligently as those of the wide receiver who stretches to put the football over the goal line in the Super Bowl. For all that has been gained with this, something essential has started to drift away: . The idea that a moment is a moment, transitory and somehow more precious because it's never coming around again. These days, you can't be sure that it will ever leave. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","On Dec. 7, 1963, a television sports director introduced the instant replay .

"Washington (CNN) -- Small portable sleep tents for infants and small children may pose a safety hazard, prompting the Consumer Product Safety Commission and KidCo Inc. to issue a voluntary recall of more than 220,000 PeaPod and PeaPod Plus Travel Beds. The safety commission said babies can potentially roll off the edge of the inflatable air mattress and become trapped between the mattress and the fabric sides of the tent and suffocate. The recall was prompted in part after a report that a 5-month-old boy in New York was found dead last year with his face pressed against the side wall of the tent. The cause of death was not determined, according to the safety commission. There are nine other reports in the United States and Canada of children who became trapped or were found crying underneath the mattress. The travel tents were made in China and sold at independent juvenile specialty stores nationwide and online at Amazon.com from January 2005 until now for between $70 and $100. The safety commission said the tents have a zippered side and an inflatable air mattress that fits into a zippered pocket underneath the floor of the tent. The tents fold into a round shape and come with a fabric bag for storage and transport. Consumers are being warned to stop using the tents, which come in a variety of colors and models, and contact the Libertyville, Illinois-based company to get a free repair kit.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Frank DiPascali, formerly the finance chief at Bernard Madoff's investment advisory business, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday to 10 charges including securities fraud and international money laundering. Frank DiPascali, center in this courtroom sketch, said he knew for about 20 years he was engaged in wrongdoing. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 125 years. With his guilty plea, DiPascali waived his right to a trial. As Tuesday's hearing commenced, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Sullivan explained that for him to accept DiPascali's guilty plea, DiPascali would have to sufficiently convince him that he was, in fact, guilty. That set the stage for a dramatic statement from DiPascali about his history at Madoff's firm, his personal relationship with Madoff, and the mechanics of a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme for which Madoff was convicted in June. While DiPascali's guilty plea and the judge's acceptance of it were expected, both the defense and the prosecution were surprised by the judge's decision to reject DiPascali's bail agreement -- and to have him escorted from the courtroom in handcuffs. The defense and even the prosecution pleaded with the judge not to order DiPascali into custody. Prosecutors told the judge they believed remanding DiPascali would impede the ""efficiency"" of their Madoff investigation. Marc Mukasey, the lead defense attorney, stood multiple times to dispute the decision, variously suggesting to the judge that DiPascali instead be put under house detention, that he wear an electronic monitoring device, and that the decision on his bail agreement be postponed for 48 to 72 hours. He added that DiPascali's family was ""completely unprepared"" for this outcome. While Sullivan patiently heard out Mukasey's many counterproposals, he refused to back down from his decision, asserting that DiPascali was too serious a flight risk given the ""astronomical"" maximum sentence he may receive. The judge also said that he could not ""overlook the conduct [DiPascali] admitted to"" despite DiPascali's avowed determination to do the right thing henceforth. Though DiPascali remained outwardly calm for much of Tuesday's proceedings, the judge's decision not to grant him bail appeared to stun him. He seemed in a daze as it became clear he would leave the courtroom in handcuffs, cupping his head in his hands and rubbing his temples. Earlier in his testimony, DiPascali recounted how he joined Madoff's company as a newly minted high-school grad in 1975. He held numerous jobs during his 33-year tenure -- options trader and research analyst among them -- but above all he was a ""guy who did whatever he was told to do around the office."" Working side by side with Madoff for decades, DiPascali developed a tight bond with his employer. ""Bernie was a mentor to me and more,"" he said, adding that he was ""loyal to a terrible, terrible fault."" His sense of loyalty led him to falsify documents for his boss for years on end, he said. Using a financial program, he looked up historical prices of stocks and then drafted customer statements showing bogus stock transactions. He calculated theoretical commissions that the business should have received from the trades that it did not actually make, and then wired money from account to account to make those commissions appear, he said. And as a principal point of contact for investors in Madoff's investment advisory business, DiPascali said, he also regularly fielded calls from investors curious about how their money was being managed, knowing that the trades he told them about were entirely fictitious. He said he had been aware that what he was doing was wrong since the ""late '80s, early '90s."" ""I don't know how I went from an 18-year-old kid who happened to have a job [to] standing in front of you today,"" he said. DiPascali repeatedly stated that he perpetrated the massive fraud in collusion ""with others,"" though he specified neither who those other were nor how many they numbered. DiPascali said he rationalized to himself that Madoff's victims would have a soft landing if the Ponzi scheme ever came crumbling down. He said he thought Madoff had assets he could liquefy in a worst-case scenario. ""I know my apology means nothing,"" DiPascali said. His voice quavered as he expressed remorse for his part in swindling charities that had invested with Madoff. Miriam Siegman, a Madoff victim who said she lost 40 years' worth of personal savings in the scheme and was now on the brink of homelessness, asked the judge to reject DiPascali's guilty plea. She insisted that the ""full truth"" would come out only if DiPascali stood trial. Both legal teams said they expected sentencing to happen in May. Each side will have the opportunity to submit documents and testimonies in support of or against DiPascali before Sullivan hands down the sentence. DiPascali is the second person involved in the Madoff scheme to land behind bars as a result of the fraud. In June, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 counts and was sentenced to 150 years in prison for masterminding the scheme. Prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud committed by a single person, totaling billions in losses to investors.","NEW: Judge denies bail for Frank DiPascali, despite deal he had with prosecutors .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agreed Tuesday to team up and tackle a checklist of economic, nuclear, security and environmental challenges. Obama welcomed the Indian leader to the White House on Tuesday in what is the first state visit of his presidency. The two men had what they called a productive sit-down meeting before briefing reporters. ""I believe that the relationship between the United States and India will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century"" and will reflect the ""strategic dialogue"" between the countries, Obama said, calling India ""the world's largest multiethnic democracy"" with a fast-growing economy. ""We're the world's two largest democracies. We have a range of shared values and ideals. We're both entrepreneurial societies. We're both multiethnic societies. We are societies that believe in human rights and core freedoms that are enshrined in our founding documents,"" said Obama, who also stressed the dynamic role of the growing Indian-American community. Singh's visit comes amid his country's continued tense relationship with nuclear rival Pakistan, regional concerns over the Afghan war and the burgeoning trade relationship between the U.S. and India. It also follows a year after the deadly terror attack on the Indian city of Mumbai. Obama said he and Singh ""agreed to strengthen the economic recovery and expand trade and investment"" to create jobs from both nations. ""Indian investment in America is creating and sustaining jobs across the United States, and the United States is India's largest trading and investment partner,"" Obama said. Obama said he reaffirmed his administration's commitment to implement a civil nuclear agreement with India, which Singh signed with former President George W. Bush. Both countries are attempting to put the finishing touches on the deal, which would provide for the development of Indian nuclear power for peaceful uses. Obama also supported Singh's backing for nuclear nonproliferation efforts. ""I look forward to ... India's participation as a full partner in our shared vision of a world without nuclear weapons,"" he said. Ahead of next month's Copenhagen climate change framework meeting, Obama said he and Singh settled on a ""comprehensive"" agreement that would ""cover all the issues under negotiation"" and would build on what the president called the ""progress"" of his recent trip to China. Obama said he and the Indian prime minister have agreed to pursue new efforts, such as a clean energy initiative, more affordable energy, a green partnership to reduce poverty and an effort to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels. ""We resolved to take significant national mitigation actions that will strengthen the world's ability to combat climate change. We agreed to stand by these commitments with full transparency, through appropriate processes, as to their implementation,"" he said. As for security, he and Singh decided to work closer on information-sharing to prevent the kind of militant attack that happened in Mumbai last year, and they discussed Obama's Afghan policy review, which is expected to lead to an announcement on troop levels next week. Obama said the pair agreed to widen education exchanges in science and technology and ties between universities and colleges. He said both countries want researchers to work together to reduce hunger and fight disease. Singh also touched on the same topics and invited Obama and his family to visit India, an invitation the U.S. leader accepted. Noting the global economic crisis illustrates ""the fact that our prosperity is interlinked,"" Singh reiterated Obama's remarks on tightening trade and investment ties. ""We admire the leadership that President Obama has provided to stimulate and guide the [Group of 20] process that is now fully in place,"" he said. He also endorsed collaboration in education, health and agriculture. ""We will deepen our ongoing cooperation in frontier areas of science and technology, nuclear power and space,"" Singh said, also noting the two agreed on the early and ""full implementation of our civil nuclear cooperation agreement."" As for climate change, he said he and Obama ""have agreed on the need for a substantive and comprehensive outcome which would cover mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology."" Singh also brought up another issue: that the U.S.-India ""strategic partnership should facilitate transfer of high technologies to India."" ""The lifting of U.S. export controls on high-technology exports to India will open vast opportunities for joint research and development efforts,"" he said. ""It will enable U.S. industry to benefit from the rapid economic and technological transformation that is now under way in our country."" On Afghanistan, Singh pointed out the importance of helping the war-wracked country emerge ""as a modern state."" ""The forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated. President Obama and I have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism."" On Tuesday evening, Singh and his wife, Gursharan Kaur, will attend a state dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, with Oscar-winning singer-actress Jennifer Hudson scheduled to entertain the black-tie crowd. Singh's visit -- his second to Washington after a meeting with Bush -- will last five days. He arrived in the United States on Sunday. He attended a luncheon Monday hosted by the U.S. India Business Council and U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and he addressed the Council on Foreign Relations. On Wednesday, Singh will meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates and later will attend a reception for the Indian community hosted by Meera Shankar, the Indian ambassador to the U.S. Singh on Thursday will fly to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The 77-year-old Singh is a Cambridge- and Oxford-educated economist who was governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1982-1985 and the nation's finance minister from 1991-1996. A member of the Congress Party, he is serving a second five-year term as prime minister.
