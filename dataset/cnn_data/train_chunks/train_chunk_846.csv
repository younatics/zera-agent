"A housewife bitten by a false widow spider says she is now too scared to sleep in her own bedroom after she ended up in intensive care. Alison Blackburn, 49, has been sleeping on her sofa as she is too terrified to return to the room where she was bitten by Britain’s most venous spider. Surgeons had to drain the poison from her left foot after the attack, as her ankle ballooned and the pain spread to her pelvic area. Terror: Alison Blackburn has been sleeping on her sofa as she is too terrified to return to the room where she was bitten by a false widow spider . Pain: Surgeons had to drain the poison from her left foot after the attack, as her ankle ballooned and the pain spread to her pelvic area . She had been asleep in her bedroom in Stood, Kent, in the early hours of January 10 when she was suddenly woken by a sharp pain in her stomach. By 6am her partner Gary Pelatt, 50, noticed her foot was red, although it was not painful but within a few hours her foot and ankle had swollen so much she could not get her shoe on. She then visited her family doctor. 'By this time I was feeling very unwell,' said Ms Blackburn. 'I kept going hot and then cold. I was shivering and I was in a lot of pain.' Recovery: Although Ms Blackburn is now back at home and recovering, she is sleeping on a sofa downstairs - too scared to return to the bedroom where the spider bit her . She was given a prescription, but the swelling became worse. By the evening she had a raging fever and began to hallucinate so Mr Pelatt called an ambulance and she was then taken to hospital. Ms Blackburn was rushed to Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent where . she was immediately admitted to intensive care and fed antibiotics . through a drip. She spent five days in intensive care and had an operation to drain the poison from her foot to reduce the swelling. She said:'I was hallucinating things. I thought there was . water running down all of the walls. Swollen: Medical staff gave her antibiotics through a drip and allowed her home, but a rash and swelling developed and she had to be rushed back to the hospital by ambulance . 'I was burning up and shaking and my heart murmur, which usually can't be heard, was noticed straight away by the paramedics. 'I . felt so sick. I had pins and needles in my leg, it was throbbing. I was . slurring my words. I had to have an operation to get rid of all the . poison in my foot. 'It's been traumatic. People need to know how dangerous these spiders are - they can be lethal.' After her operation doctors told the mother-of-one was that a false widow spider was likely to have bitten her. Although she is now back at home and recovering, she is sleeping on a sofa downstairs - too scared to return to the . bedroom where the spider bit her. Ms Blackburn has fumigated her house and washed all her . clothing and bedding in an attempt to get rid of the spider. But 10 days after the bite she says she is still too terrified to go upstairs in her home. 'I'm still in shock and that spider is still around somewhere,' she said. 'Since coming out of hospital I'm terrified to even be in my own home. 'I can't go upstairs, I sleep on the sofa and I'm having to talk to someone about it because I'm petrified all the time. 'I can't leave the house in the day because of my leg, but I can't face being in the house either.' The country was hit by a spate of false widow attacks at autumn and an expert has warned that there could be more bites reported in the next few weeks. Bitten: The country was hit by a spate of false widow attacks last autumn, and an expert has warned that there could be more bites reported in the next few weeks . Dr John Tweddle, from the life . sciences department at the Natural History Museum in London, said: . 'There are two main species of false widow spider and they are around . all year. 'The young reach maturity in September and October, which was why a number of attacks were reported then. 'But they have gone onto become adults and are still a threat.' He said that Ms Blackburn was right to be concerned that she might be bitten again by the same spider. Dr Tweddle said : 'Theoretically you can be bitten by the same spider twice. 'They can bite more than once. That is how they kill their prey, unlike bees. It is part of their feeding and defence system.' False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen . with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can . reach about 15mm in size. Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England. HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE . Do not disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened. To avoid being bitten while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs. Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight. If you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing items. If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.","Doctors think Alison Blackburn was bitten by UK's most venomous spider .

Three camels who escaped from a circus in Melbourne have been captured by amused police, who took the opportunity to snap a selfie with the escape artists. The animals hoofed it under the cloak of darkness early Thursday, before they were spotted at a McDonald's drive-through in Melbourne's south-east around 3am. A patron at the fast food restaurant who had stopped for breakfast with friends, told the Herald Sun he was surprised by the discovery. 'You never usually see camels there - it was a funny discovery'. An hour later, Narre Warren police responded to reports of an unusual traffic hazard on the Princes Highway, where they found the trio munching on trees on the side of the road. The officers got snap happy with the runaways as they waited for circus staff to return the animals to the big top. The camels had escaped from the Circus Royale just 300m from where they were found. Police said the camels had caused little trouble during their brief break-out. We’ve had cows and sheep and everything like that, but we’ve never had camels,' Constable Steven Pope told 3AW.

"By . Helen Pow . Suicide: Staten Island teenager Felicia Garcia, pictured, threw herself under a train as her horrified classmates watched on . A bullied Staten Island teenager threw herself under a train yesterday as her horrified classmates watched on. Felicia Garcia, 15, sobbing, put down her school bag and purposefully fell backwards to her death at around 3.15pm at the Huguenot Staten Island Railway station platform, which was packed with fellow Tottenville High School students. The teen, who friends claimed had long been tormented by school bullies, in particular football players, tweeted on Monday: 'I cant. im done. I give up.' The same day she posted photographs of herself on Instagram where she appears beaten and bruised, with her lips seemingly cut or sewn together. She added the hashtag 'beatup.' A friend, Alissa Compitello, tweeted yesterday that the relentless bullying Felicia was dealt at school had driven the student to take her own life. 'SHE WAS BULLIED... SHE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT IF SHE WASN'T BULLIED,' the teen wrote. Earlier, Compitello tweeted: 'All this girl wanted was to be left alone... and nobody could do that for her. #prayforfelicia.' Another pal, Domenica Modica, said her father carried Felicia to the ambulance stretcher and tried to revive her before she was rushed to Staten Island University Hospital. She was pronounced dead just before 5pm. Worrying: The teen, pictured on Monday, had signalled that she was depressed on Twitter and Instagram . Friends claimed football players at the . Staten Island school were behind the destructive bullying, claiming they targeted her . because 'she looked different and had piercings'. According to the Staten Island Advance, she had been in peer mediation and was behind closed doors with counselors all day yesterday after the latest dispute with a group of male Tottenville students. Felicia had hinted of her depression on social media, with posts becoming increasingly intense in recent days. On . her Instagram account, she had a picture of herself grinning with the . word 'Depressed' covering her eyes. The caption read: 'Just because . someone is smiling . doesn't make them happy.' On October 17, Felicia tweeted: 'I . hate when peopl (sic) are in my buisness (sic), you dont even know whats . going on, mind ya neck #Shot -_-' Tragic: Felicia, 15, pictured left and right, leaped to her death at around 3.15pm on Wednesday at the Huguenot Staten Island Railway station platform . Bullied: Friends said Felicia, pictured, was relentlessly picked on at school and this drove her to take her own life . She also wrote recently: 'Take me as I am or leave me as I was.' Felicia moved from foster home to foster home after her parents died, leaving her and younger brother orphans. She also spent time living at friends' houses and at her ex-boyfriend's place. '(She) had a terrible life on top of . all the heartache — bullies at school taunted her and spread rumors,' Gabriella Leone, whose younger sister . witnessed the incident, told The New York Post. But Compitello, who, like hundreds of . Tottenville students, wore black for mourning on Thursday and purple . to symbolise the colour of the school and anti-bullying, said she never . expected Felicia to do something so drastic. 'She was never upset, that's the thing. None of us saw this coming,' she told the SI Advance. 'She was saying ""I have mediation . with so many people,"" and I said, 'Are you okay?' She said, ""I am fine. Don't worry about me."" She was smiling. That's how she was.' Harrowing: On Monday, Felicia tweeted 'I cant, im done, I give up' Depressed: On her Instagram account, she had a picture of her eyes crossed over by the word 'Depressed' with the caption, 'just because someone is smiling doesn't make them happy' Her friend, Dawn DiBenedetto, 17, added that Felicia never did drugs, and even shook her head 'no' when the topic arose. 'I'm still in shock; we're all in shock; because she's not the person you'd see this coming from. She was a good kid.' A Facebook tribute page . 'RIPFeliciaGarciaStopBullying' has been set up for the girl and by Thursday afternoon had more than 7,500 likes.

Station: Felicia, sobbing, jumped in front of the train at the Huguenot Staten Island Railway station platform, pictured . Footballers: Friends said football players were behind the incessant bullying . The NYC Department of Education said in a statement that Chancellor Dennis Walcott has reached out to the student's guardian and sent a crisis team to the school. An emotional principal John Tuminaro called his students to break the news of Felicia's horrific death, which many were already circulating on their cell phones. Felicia's friends are holding a candlelight vigil today at the station where she was killed, and are making bracelets to raise money for a memorial in the bullied teen's honour and to give to Felicia's younger brother. Nearly two years ago exactly, 18-year-old Kyle Jensen jumped to his death at the same train station. He had also attended Tottenville, although only briefly.","Felicia Garcia, 15, leaped to her death around 3.15pm yesterday at the Huguenot Staten Island Railway station in Staten Island, New York .

"By . Leon Watson . and Kieran Corcoran . and NADEEM BADSHAH . When four Asian friends 'go for an English' in hit comedy show Goodness Gracious Me, they ordered their food 'extra, extra bland'. The hilarious spoof sketch turned the tables on Britons who love to 'go for a curry' and ask for it to be 'extra hot'. Now Michelin-starred chef Dominic Chapman . is hoping to tempt Indian foodies with a range of traditional British dishes, . from roast chicken and bread and butter pudding to rhubarb tart. And he promises they will be far from bland. Spoof: Hit BBC comedy show Goodness Gracious Me say a group of Asian friends order their food 'extra, extra bland'. Now a British chef is taking British food to India - but it won't be bland . Michelin-starred chef Dominic Chapman is hoping tempt Indian foodies with a range of traditional British dishes, from roast chicken, bread and butter pudding and rhubarb tart . Mr Chapman, 40, is part of a team of UK chefs heading to India next month . to showcase the best of British cuisine at a 10-day festival of food called the Taste of Britain Curry Festival in the southern city of Hyderabad. While the rest of the cooks are offering mild British . curries to the audience, Mr Chapman will be serving up . exclusively British favourites. Mr Chapman, who until last month ran the one-Michelin star Royal Oak in Berkshire, has created a menu filled with British classics like Lancashire hotpot along with desserts . including banana Eton mess for Indian diners at the Park Hyatt Hotel. Traditional menu: Mr Chapman will be presenting Lancashire hotpot (left) and roast chicken (right) at the Taste of Britain Curry Festival . Contrast: While most of the British contingent will still be cooking curries (right), Mr Chapman's menu includes deserts like Eton mess (left) The Taste of Britain curry festival has been backed by Prime Minister David Cameron. He said: 'I'm . delighted to see that more than 200 years after the first curry house . opened in Britain our unique brand of Asian cuisine is now being sought . in the countries where it originally came from. 'In . recent years curry has become part of the British identity - a firm . favourite that is enjoyed by more than two million people every week. But it's so much more than just good food. 'It's . about talented restaurateurs and chefs; it's about hard-working . families; it's about enterprising small businesses that provide tens of . thousands of jobs and it's about bringing in billions of pounds into our . economy.' Classic: Mr Chapman will also try his luck with a tradition shepherd's pie . On his traditional British project, Mr Chapman, who is not a curry chef by training, told MailOnline that there was great potential for India to get stuck in to classic pub grub. He said: 'In India the British classics would go down very, very well - and this is the angle we're looking at. 'At the moment there other cuisines - like Italian restaurants and pizza, alongside the traditional Indian food with the Tandoor ovens and kebabs. 'In Dubai you've got lots of different style of restaurant - why can't you do that in India? The country's growing - there's absolutely no reason why a pub serving fish and chips, shepherd's pie or a Sunday roast with a pint of beer couldn't all work. There's a taste for it that hasn't been tapped yet, and we want to spread the word about our British cuisine.' Hyderabad is a city famous for its . biryani rice-based dishes and a style of cooking from the Mughal empire . which ruled India in the 16th and 17th centuries. Syed Ahmed, director of the Taste of Britain Curry Festival which is taking place early June, said: 'We . know Indians have a sweet tooth, we will take over some puddings like . bread and butter pudding, rhubarb tart, and lemon tart. 'Dominic is running with a traditional English menu like Sunday roast with chicken, casserole dishes.' Curry isn't the only Indian food that has made its way onto British tables. Kedgeree is a traditional British breakfast dish made from curried rice, smoked fish, boiled eggs, parsley and lemon juice. It may be considered a traditional British breakfast dish, but its roots are well bedded in Indian cooking having started its life as khichari, a humble dish of rice and lentils. Thanks to the British Raj and the colonisation of the sub-continent the dish was taken, adapted and turned into something more familiar to those serving in India, and it returned to these shores with them. Similarly, mulligatawny soup  is also an . Anglo-Indian invention. The name is from the Tamil language of south east India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia, meaning 'pepper water'. Created by servants for the Raj who . demanded a soup course from a cuisine that had never produced one. Piccalilli, meanwhile, is slightly different. It is an English interpretation of Indian pickles, a . relish of chopped pickled vegetables and spices; regional recipes vary . considerably. The word is believed to date from the middle of the 18th century when it appeared in a book for housekeepers. The origins of Britain's favourite curry, the Chicken Tikka Masala, are hotly debated. Chefs in Glasgow have claimed it was invented there in the . early 1970s. But Delhi's . leading food historians have dismissed as 'preposterous', arguing the dish was a recipe devised in the Mughal period. Another British interpretation of Indian food is the famous balti, invented in Birmingham in the 1970s when a chef moved from making meals for family and friends in the immigrant community to opening a restaurant. Mr Ahmed, 52, from London, said British curries are popular because they are different to Indian cuisine. He said: 'Some people will say it's like selling coal to Newcastle or ice to the Eskimos, but I don't see it like this. 'They see our ingredients are better and of premium quality.  And . the dishes are milder and healthier, I don't want to criticise but . sometimes in India it becomes too spicy and overpowering. 'With the British palate, some people eat hot curries but generally it's milder and it has less ghee and butter. 'When we first went to India in 2006 we thought it was a challenge as curry originates in India but they are food-loving people and like to experiment.' As well as Mr Chapman and Mr Ahmed six other chefs from Britain will be travelling to the southern city of Hyderabad. Among the other chefs are Partha Mittra, from Cheshire, Allam Shah Ullah, from Sheffield, Abul Monsur, from Kent, Abdus Shahid, from Bury St Edmunds, Altaf Hussain, from Hertfordshire, and Anwar Hossein, from Sudbury in Suffolk. One British restaurant boss who has been offered the chance to open a curry house in India is Enam Ali, chair of the Guild of Bangladeshi Restaurateurs. He was offered a proposal to open a branch of his Le Raj restaurant in Epsom, Surrey, in Kolkata in northern India. Mr Ali believes British curries will be a long-term success in India. 'The name British curry is trendy and the flavours are different than in India as British curries are not extremely hot. The cooking process is different as in India they cook with a big pot like a Mughal dinner. 'In London, they have followed a bit of French and English style of cooking one dish individually. Bill Gates said to me during the 2012 Olympics our lamb curry was better than in India.' But curry expert Pat Chapman, author of the Cobra Good Curry Guide, is more sceptical. He said: 'The reaction of all of my Indian friends to the British Curry is one of disdain. 'Maybe it's an over-reaction; one or two formulaic Bangladeshi curry houses produce excellent food. But I have my doubts that British cuisine will take off in India.'","Chef Dominic Chapman .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The body of Garrett Elsey, 22, from Alberta, Canada, was found at a waste treatment facility in Bristol . A Canadian student was crushed to death in the back of a bin lorry before being found at a waste facility, it has been revealed. Garrett Elsey, from Alberta, was discovered at a recycling plant in Bristol a day after arriving in the UK to start a masters degree in international security. Police are trying to work out how he ended up in a communal waste bin that was then picked up and taken to New Earth Solutions last Thursday Morning. He is believed to have been out on a night drinking with a friend from Canada he used to play rugby with. The friends went their separate ways after the drinking session - but Mr Elsey somehow ended up in a communal bin kept behind closed doors next to the Jacobs building in Jacob's Wells Road. Police sources have now confirmed that the popular 22-year-old may still have been alive when he was picked up on the lorry's collection round. Avon and Somerset police have said further investigations are needed before the cause of death can be officially confirmed, but it is understood his injuries were caused by crushing. Force spokeswoman Claire Stanley said: 'We have provisional findings, however further investigations need to take place in conjunction with the coroner. 'This may take time, which means we cannot confirm cause of death at this stage.' An inquest is likely to be opened later this week and adjourned for several months for information and evidence to be gathered. Mr Elsey’s family still have many burning questions they want answered. It is believed the student arrived in . the UK on Wednesday night, but the airline lost his luggage. His uncle . Brent said he sent a text message to his parents to say he had checked . into his new digs and all was well. His body was found in a bin in Clifton, Bristol, a day after going out with a friend . The bright 22-year-old had recently completed a degree in history and political science at Ottawa’s Carleton University and had posted on his Twitter web page of his excitement at moving to study at Bristol University. His parents were given the shocking news of his death last Thursday, by officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Bristol police had identified him from his passport and the fingerprints he gave when he entered the UK. Paying . tribute to Mr Elsey, his uncle said: 'He was always happy. He was a . very hard worker. He always tried to do the best that he could. He was . not afraid of any kind of challenge and was very successful at most of . the things he put his hand to.' The 22-year-old's body was discovered at New Earth Solutions, Avonmouth . A bin lorry from New Earth Solutions, similar to the one in which Garrett Elsey was crushed to death. Residents at the Clifton apartment block were horrified by what appears to have happened. Communal bins at Belgrave Road and Park Place, Clifton, and Brandon Villas, Hotwells, were also among nine areas cordoned off by police, who then narrowed down their investigations to the communal bins store at Jacobs Building, next to West End car park. A woman who lives there said: 'It was a complete shock - the circumstances are a bit concerning really.' Another resident added: 'It’s grim.' Nobody from May Gurney has been available for comment.","Garrett Elsey was found dead at a Bristol waste facility last week .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Anonymity: Maura McGowan, chairwoman of the Bar Council, believes people accused of sex crimes, including rape, should have their identities protected . The identities of men accused of rape and other sex crimes should be kept secret unless they are found guilty in court, a leading lawyer said yesterday. Maura McGowan, a deputy High Court judge and chief of the professional body for barristers, said the law should protect the identity of those charged with sex offences because the crimes ‘carry such a stigma’. ‘Until they have been proven to have done something as awful as this – I think there is a strong argument in cases of this sort, because they carry such stigma with them, to maintain the defendant’s anonymity, until he is convicted,’ she said. ‘But once the defendant is convicted then of course everything should be open to scrutiny and to the public.’ Miss McGowan, who is chairman of the Bar Council, acknowledged that there were arguments in favour of allowing suspects to be named. ‘There is obviously a public interest in open justice,’ she said. ‘People would say that they are entitled to know not simply who has been convicted but who has been accused.’ She added that if Jimmy Savile had been accused of sex crimes when he was alive he should have been named. ‘In a case like that, people would say, if one complainant comes forward against a person it might give other people who don’t know her, but who went through the same experience, the courage to come forward as well.’ The idea of anonymity for rape defendants was a surprise inclusion in the list of promises made by David Cameron and Nick Clegg when the Coalition was formed in 2010. Ms McGowan says the law should be changed because rape allegations 'carry such a stigma' (file picture) Backing: Terry Harrison, who was falsely accused of rape five years ago, has backed Ms Mcgowan's stance . But the plan was dropped by the end . of that year in the face of criticism and fears that protection for some . defendants would mean secrecy could be extended in future to others. John Cooper, a human rights barrister, said: ‘Anonymity for sex crime . victims is unworkable. ‘Why should somebody who is accused of a sex crime receive anonymity? ‘Why don’t we broaden that out to . include people who are accused of beating children or murdering . children? There’s no distinguishing case for sex crimes to be singled . out, it has to be anonymity for all or anonymity for none.’ Alleged victims of certain sexual offences, including rape, have been entitled to lifelong anonymity after making their complaint, since 1976. Anonymity can be lifted if the complainant chooses to reveal their identity of if the court orders it to encourage witnesses to come forward. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976, which brought in anonymity for complainants, also provided for anonymity for defendants. This was done to provide equality between complainants and defendants, and to protect potentially innocent defendants from stigma. This provision was repealed in 1988, meaning those accused of sexual offences no longer have any particular entitlement to anonymity. Source: parliament.uk . Victims and alleged victims of rape . have been granted anonymity since 1976 to spare women from humiliation . and encourage more victims to report attacks. The law originally gave the same protection to those charged with rape. But anonymity for defendants was . withdrawn in 1988 after judges protested that it prevented police from . appealing for witnesses. Judges also said that the acquittal of a man charged with rape was enough to clear his name and reputation. But Terry Harrison, who was falsely . accused of rape in 2007, told the BBC: ‘If the person has done a crime . as heinous as that, then they should be named and shamed, I agree, but . not until they’ve actually been done for it. ‘Innocent until proven guilty is a . load of rubbish. I was guilty until I was proven innocent, and even when . I was proven innocent I’m still getting judged. ‘I ended up going to jail for something I didn’t do. ‘I was in the paedophile wing, the . rapists’ wing, the grass wing. I was there for three months before the . DNA results finally came back negative.’ The woman who falsely accused Mr . Harrison, 42- year-old Shirley Prince, was jailed for three months in . 2008 for perverting the course of justice. In September, MailOnline reported how Janet Higginbottom (right), 36, was jailed for 15 months after she tried to frame her ex-lover for rape after he refused to rekindle their affair. Higginbottom got drunk and dialled 999 at 2am falsely claiming she had been stalked and then raped in the street after being followed home. Manchester Crown Court heard how Higginbottom of Broadbottom, Hyde, then identified her ex as the culprit, wrongly claiming he had fled in a car after the incident even though he was at home all the time. Higginbottom’s unnamed former boyfriend was later arrested in a 4am raid in front of his current girlfriend and held for 11 hours. He was eventually freed without charge after Higginbottom broke down and confessed she had fabricated her story after detectives uncovered inconsistencies in her evidence. Jailing her for 15 months the judge, recorder Simon Killeen told her: 'This offence was malicious.' Earlier the court heard how Higginbottom, who was described as 'lonely and isolated', had had a fling with the victim in 2007. They had split, but on 2011 Higginbottom had sent him a series of text messages in a bid to rekindle the relationship. When he did not respond to her advances, Higginbottom began sending him abusive text messages, the court heard. Shortly afterwards she called 999 and claimed in a rambling 20-minute phone call that he had raped her in the Levenshulme area of Manchester. Police went to the scene after the false report was made at 2.30am on November 26. They found Higginbottom staggering in the street and took her to a station so she could receive specialist help and support. When she was examined by a doctor, it was claimed she had injuries which supported her claim. Higginbottom was interviewed by officers and told them how she had seen her 'attacker' in Manchester and he had followed her and raped her on the street. She said he then drove off in a car and provided the registration number for it. But Greater Manchester Police said the investigation highlighted a number of serious inconsistencies and when asked about these Higginbottom later admitted she had lied about the rape and it hadn’t happened.","Maura McGowan believes law should change to give anonymity to accused .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A mysterious disease is causing starfish to tear themselves to pieces. The arms of infected starfish begin to twist and then ‘crawl’ away from the creature’s body, until they tear off and the animal’s insides spill out. Divers and scientists first noticed the horrific disease off the coast of Washington state, but sightings of dead starfish have been reported as far north as Alaska and in southern California. Scroll down for video . A mysterious disease is causing starfish to tear themselves to pieces. The arms of infected starfish begin to twist and then 'crawl' away from the creature's body, until they tear off (pictured) The disease prevents the creatures from growing new arms like healthy starfish and they die within approximately 24 hours, according to a report by PBS News. Starfish have been dying by the millions in recent months along the U.S. west coast, worrying biologists who say the sea creatures are key to the marine ecosystem. Scientists first started noticing the mass deaths in one species – the sunflower starfish - in June 2013, but the disease, which has been dubbed sea star wasting syndrome - has now spread to 12 species. Different types of starfish are affected, from wild ones along the coast to those in captivity, according to Jonathan Sleeman, director of the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Centre. Scientists first started noticing the mass deaths in one species - the sunflower starfish - in June 2013, but the disease, which has been dubbed sea star wasting syndrome - has now spread to 12 species. A healthy sunflower starfish is pictured . 'The two species affected most are Pisaster ochraceus (purple sea star or ochre starfish) and Pycnopodia helianthoides (sunflower sea star),' he wrote in a statement in December. The sunflower starfish is considered among the largest of all the species and can span more than a metre in diameter. The most commonly observed symptoms of the suspected disease are white lesions on the arms of the starfish. The lesions spread rapidly, resulting in the loss of the arm. The infection consumes the creature's entire body and tears itself to pieces. Entire populations have been wiped out in Puget Sound off the coast of Washington state, in the Salish Sea off Canada's British Columbia as well as along the coast of California. The mortality rate is estimated at 95 per cent. Divers and scientists first noticed the horrific disease off the coast of Washington state in the Pugnet Sound, but sightings of dead starfish have been reported as far north as Alaska and in southern California . Ben Miner, a biology professor at Western Washington University, collected healthy starfish and those showing symptoms of the disease to study in his laboratory At first, the starfish twist their arms into knots and then legions form on their skin, before the arm tears away from the body (pictured) One diver said the scene under the waves was reminiscent of something from a horror film as there are ‘bodies everywhere’. Scientists who have spent decades studying the local ecosystem have yet to identify the cause. 'What we currently think is likely happening is that there is a pathogen, like a parasite or a virus or a bacteria, that is infecting the sea stars and that compromises in some way their immune system,' Pete Raimondi, chair of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology, at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told AFP. The creatures are thought to become more susceptible to bacteria which is ‘causing a secondary infection that causes most of the damages that you see.' Ben Miner, a biology professor at Western Washington University collected healthy starfish and those showing symptoms of the disease to study in his laboratory. He told PBS News that he came across arms and piles of deteriorating sea stars off the coast of North Seattle. At first, the starfish twist their arms into knots and then lesions form on their skin. Their arms then crawl away from their own body until they tear off and the animal’s insides spill out, he explained. ‘They start ripping themselves apart,’ he said. The animals destroy themselves within 24 hours of the symptoms appearing. Here is all that was left of one animal that tore itself apart . The 2013 phenomenon has not been observed solely along the West Coast as a smaller outbreak also killed East Coast sea stars last year, leading a few scientists to speculate that ocean acidification or even climate change could be to blame, while most think an exotic pathogen is attacking the animals. Previous cases were believed to be associated with warmer waters - starfish have sensitive skin and prefer cooler water - but most scientists do not believe this to be the case this time around. Biologists are worried about the decline of the sea creatures, which are key to the marine ecosystem. A stock image of the sunflower starfish is pictured . When the die-offs happened previously, the geographic span of the infections was much smaller and far fewer sea stars were affected. In 1983, an epidemic nearly wiped out the Pisaster ochraceus from tidal pools along the southern coast of California. Another, smaller die-off in 1997 may have been caused by warmer waters in an El Nino year, scientists said. 'Sea stars are important because 'they play a key role in this ecosystem on the West Coast,' Dr Raimondi said. Starfish eat mussels, barnacles, snails, molluscs and other smaller sea life, so their health is considered a measure of marine life on the whole in a given area. Dr Sleeman said that when starfish decline in number, 'the mussel population has the potential to dramatically increase, which could significantly alter the rocky intertidal zone.' While starfish make up an important component of the base of the ocean food chain and are considered a top predator, they are in turn eaten by other starfish, shorebirds, gulls, and sometimes sea otters. In an effort to find out what is causing the mass deaths, scientists are collecting reports from the public, taking specimens to the lab for analysis and doing genetic sequencing to find out whether a toxin or an infection may be to blame. Citizen scientists are being encouraged to report any sightings of dead starfish and their exact location on social media sites, by using #SickStarfish.","The arms of infected starfish begin to .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This incredible photograph has sparked debate and confusion across the internet. The image, which has sweeped across social media sites, appears to show a python that has just finished a human-sized meal. While suggestions about where the picture may have been taken range between Asia, Africa and America, the general consensus is that this snake's food was human. This incredible photograph, which appears to show a snake shortly after a human-sized meal, has sparked debate and confusion across the internet . One website claims it was taken in India, where the mighty snake swallowed a sleeping drunkard. Another version goes that the snake swallowed a woman in Durban North, South Africa, this summer, and that the picture was taken by a reporter. The picture has also been claimed to have been taken in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Guyana, South America. There have also been stories that the snake was found in game reserve before eating its rescuer. Many others, including the website Hoax Slayer, have claimed the photograph is fake. If real, this would not be the first reported incident involving a python eating a human whole . One of the deadliest creatures in the world, this would not represent the first time a python has eaten a human. In 2002, a 20ft python reportedly swallowed a ten-year-old boy whole in Durban, South Africa, in the first recorded man-eating incident for its species. Meanwhile, last month a ten-foot albino Burmese python swallowed two cats in Florida, United States. Elsewhere, in 2011 a 16-foot python was found in the Everglades National Park, United States, after swallowing a whole adult deer. Python snakes are found in countries across Africa, Asia and Australia. They are also now found in North America after making their way into the Everglades National Park, Florida. There are currently 26 species of python recognised across the world. Reported attacks on humans are rare, and the snake is generaly expected to remain calm unless startled or provoked. Their victims are killed by constriction and then swallowed whole. Depending on the size of the prey, the digestion process can take weeks.","Incredible photograph, showing giant snake with human-sized bulge, sparks debate and confusion .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A New York woman has told how she got a piece of platinum jewelry inserted in her eye to set herself apart from the crowd. Lucy Luckayanko visited Dr Emil Chynn at Park Avenue Laser Vision to get a 'cute' heart-shaped sequin, measuring 3.5mm, placed on the white of her of right eye ball. She told Fox5 before the $3,000, one minute-long procedure: 'It's going to be a conversation maker. I will be able to tell people. It will be unique. It will be sort of my unique factor.' A permanent twinkle! Lucy Luckayanko got a piece of platinum jewelry inserted in her eye . According to Harvard and NYU-trained Dr Chynn the eye jewelry procedure has been done hundreds of times in Europe and in Los Angeles, but never before in New York. Ms Luckayanko was one of his first clients. To start the process he injected anesthetic into her eye to numb the area. Then he made a small incision to make room for the piece of jewelry. 'I'm . going to take scissors and make a little incision and try to divide a . pocket in between the sclera - the white part of your eye - and . conjunctiva clear part of your eye,' he explained. Using forceps he positioned the tiny flat stud into position on Ms Luckayanko's eye membrane. She wanted it set pointing diagonally. Minutes later she was handed a mirror to admire her new accessory and given the go-ahead to go home. 'It will be sort of my unique factor': The blonde appeared happy with her new eye jewel . Though it may sound scary, Dr Chynn insists the procedure, which was invented by a Dutch eye surgeon and introduced in 2004, is actually pretty safe. 'It's . a very thin piece of platinum that's designed for insertion on the top . of the eye, it's not in the eye so there's no risk of blindness or . anything at all,' he says. 'She . could have a little bit of local bleeding. That could go away in a . couple days or couple weeks. She could have an infection but we'll . prevent that with antibiotics.' But the jewelry has not been FDA approved and the American Academy of Ophthalmology is warning consumers about the dangers. Steady-handed: First Dr Emil Chynn at Park Avenue Laser Vision injected anesthetic into her eye to numb the area, then he made a small incision to make room for the piece of jewelry . Nearly over: Because the piece of jewelry is so tiny - 0.13 of an inch - it can't be inserted with an instrument - instead, it is placed in a drop of water on the eye membrane and floated into position . In a statement to Fox 5, the medical body said there is not 'sufficient evidence to support the safety or therapeutic value of this procedure.' It urges consumers to 'avoid placing in the eye any foreign body or material that is not approved by the FDA.' Wayne Bizer, D.O., a comprehensive ophthalmologist from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida previously warned: 'My concern would be that it might cause foreign body granuloma or scar tissue. 'The implant could also allow bacteria to . get beneath the conjunctiva causing a serious vision-threatening . infection or possibly erode the sclera, the white part of the eye.' Advocate: Dr Chynn insists the procedure, which was invented by a Dutch eye surgeon and introduced in 2004, is safe - but other professionals are warning against it . A few days after her procedure, Ms Luckayanko said she had no issues or pain and loved her new designer accessory. '50 percent of my friends are like: ""What is it? Why do you need it oh my god are you crazy?""' she exclaimed. 'But 50per cent of my friends are like: ""Oh my god, it's super cool.""' And if she gets bored of her heart-shaped implant it can be swapped it for something different. 'You can switch from a star for Christmas, for example,' Dr Chynn states on his website, adding that each swap incurs a $1,000 fee.","The eye jewel procedure has not yet been approved by the FDA .

"By . Beth Stebner . A leukemia-stricken 6-year-old boy whose family was displaced after Superstorm Sandy struck was back in his Long Island home Saturday after it was rebuilt by hundreds of volunteers. The house in Amityville has a new, extra bedroom so Steven Heckman doesn't have to share space with two sisters while he undergoes chemotherapy for leukemia. The walls are painted a bright, cheery yellow and there is a mural of Indiana Jones - Steven's all-time favorite character - painted on one wall. His tearful mother, Danielle Heckman, said she was so excited she was hyperventilating as the family moved in on Saturday morning. Scroll down for video . Hope: Steven Heckman, 6, who was battling leukemia, now has a new room in the home rebuilt by volunteers after Sandy destroyed his family's first house . Before: The Heckman family's modest Amityville home was unlivable after it was flooded by the waters from Superstorm Sandy . After: The house has been completely remolded, and an extra bedroom added . 'It was just really an incredible feeling — to walk in the door this morning and see that not only has the house been rebuilt, but it's also been furnished, literally from rugs to dressers, TVs and curtains,' Danielle Heckman told the Associated Press. The October 29 superstorm flooded the family's home and destroyed almost all they owned. To make matters worse, they did not have the money to purchase flood insurance because of Steven’s escalating medical costs. For months, they were forced to couch-surf, including a stint with the parents and three children sleeping on a queen-sized air mattress. 'The kids were very stressed out; they lost everything they had,' their mother said. The bigger worry was to keep her son away from people with colds or other ailments. An infection could have landed him in the hospital. In addition, mold from the sodden home could also be risky for Steven. A family's joy: The Heckman family had been at Disney World as part of Steven's wish from the Make A Wish Foundation; they first saw the new house upon their return on Saturday . Home sweet home: The Heckman's were thrilled to see a brand new kitchen installed, with all-new appliances . The family’s finances also played a factor. Mrs Heckman had to quit her job to look after Steven after he was diagnosed with leukemia over the summer; Mr Heckman is unemployed, according to the New York Post. The National Association of the Remodeling Industry, a not-for-profit trade group, heard about the family's plight and offered to rebuild the house with a team of volunteers. Retailers donated new interior furnishings, appliances, and dishware. The family now has a beautiful new kitchen, dining area, and more importantly, a roof over their heads. Wall of fame: The volunteers painted an image of Indiana Jones on Steven's new bedroom wall . Make a wish: Steven, right, pictured in a family photo with an actor playing his hero, Indiana Jones . In addition, a new bedroom was built for the two Heckman girls, Alexa, aged nine, and three-year-old Juliana, leaving Steven his own room. 'It was just really an incredible feeling to walk in the door this morning and see that not only has the house . been rebuilt, but it's also been furnished. -Danielle Heckman . In total, the association paid for $150,000 worth of damage. ‘I thought it was going to take us six months, maybe even a year, and to have this and to have all these people here just helping is incredible,’ she told CBS New York. The family had been in Disney World, courtesy of the Make a Wish Foundation, and returned to the fully-furnished new home, according to the Post. The foundation had agreed to fly them ahead of Sandy. However, little Steven isn’t in the clear yet – the boy has two more years of chemotherapy to go. New York News | NYC Breaking News .","Steven Heckman, 6, diagnosed with leukemia last summer .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Gwyneth Paltrow's separation announcement may have surprised her fans Tuesday, but her decision to call the divorce a 'conscious uncoupling' won't surprise anyone who's ever read her GOOP lifestyle site. That's precisely where Paltrow told the world she's parting ways with Coldplay crooner Chris Martin, followed by a lengthy explanation of the New Age process from her own lifestyle guru Dr. Habib Sadeghi and his wife. Sure, it's a divorce, they explain: but it's a divorce all about the 'wholeness in separation,' 'coming together' and 'two people playing teacher.' GOOPy divorce: Gwyneth Paltrow's announcement she'll be separating from husband of 10 years Chris Martin was a surprise to fans, but her decision to label the divorce a 'conscious uncoupling'--a decision endorsed by her physician friend and lifestyle guru Dr. Habib Sadeghi--will shock no one . Conscious uncoupling - a private act: 'We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and coparent, we will be able to continue in the same manner,' Paltrow wrote on her GOOP lifestyle site . 'We have always conducted our relationship privately,' Paltrow writes in a public announcement of the end of her marriage that immediately shut down her GOOP site. 'We hope that as we consciously uncouple and coparent, we will be able to continue in the same manner.' She lets Drs. Sadeghi and wife Dr. Sherry Sami take it from there. 'A conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing,' they write. The couple say that every pet peeve and bit of resentment is 'just the echo of an older emotional injury.' 'From this perspective,' they say, 'there are no bad guys, just two people, each playing teacher and student respectively.' To the fans: The announcement showed up on Paltrow's GOOP site Tuesday evening and immediately garnered so much traffic, the site shut down . Dr. Habib Sadeghi D.O. Paltrow's message about 'conscious uncoupling' was followed up on her website with a lengthy explanation of the GOOPy divorce technique by a couple of doctors named Habib Sadeghi and Sherry Sami. The couple live in Los Angeles along with their son and daughter. Sadeghi is a doctor of osteopathy who founded an LA clinic Be Hive of Healing, 'an integrative health center based in Los Angeles.' 'Through a unique and individualized approach to healthcare that includes evidence-based, Western medical interventions and intuitive Eastern healing modalities,' reads the bio on his clinic's website, 'Dr. Sadeghi has been able to achieve astounding results in patient cases that were otherwise deemed hopeless by traditional medicine.' Dr. Shahrzad (Sherry) Sami . Sadeghi's expertise evidently also extends into the realm of marriage counseling. According to his site, the clinic also provides services called Integrative Bioregulatory Medicine™ (iBm), Integrative Psycho-Synthesis (iPs), weight release, and Anthroposophical Medicine. His most recent book is called Within: A Spiritual Awakening to Love & Weight Loss and contains a forward by Paltrow. Sadeghi's wife is a children's dentist and orthodontist. She believes that a healthy mouth equals a healthy body and that problems of the mouth such as constricted airways 'can affect a variety of symptoms such as ADHD, seizure, bed-wetting, grinding and mouth breathing, which can potentially alter the development of the face and jaws.' So why can't they use their evolved presence of mind to simply move past resentments and stay together? According to the teachings of conscious uncoupling, humans simply aren't meant to stay married for so long. They point toward the exponential increase in lifespan that humans have experienced in the last century or so: . 'We’re living three lifetimes compared to early humans, perhaps we need to redefine the construct. Social research suggests that because we’re living so long, most people will have two or three significant long-term relationships in their lifetime. 'Our biology and psychology aren’t set up to be with one person for four, five, or six decades.' For super couple Paltrow and Martin, just one decade was apparently enough. The post rounds itself out with a final bit of counter-intuition about how fantastic divorce can really be. 'You’ll see that although it looks like everything is coming apart; it’s actually all coming back together.' Personal journey: Here, Paltrow appears at a Stand Up to Cancer event, where Dr. Sadeghi spoke on a screen about how his own struggle with cancer helped to shape his optimistic worldview .","Paltrow announced her separation from Coldplay frontman Chris Martin on her GOOP lifestyle website Tuesday evening .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . China will tomorrow become the first country in almost 40 years to soft-land a probe on the moon, in a huge step forward for its ambitious space programme. The nation will become the third in history to launch a lunar probe when the device, named 'Jade Rabbit' after a Chinese folklore character, launches at 5.30pm on Sunday evening, which is 1.30am local time. The mission forms part of a plan in which China hopes to build a permanent lunar base in order to launch future missions to Mars within the next 15 years. History: China will become just the third country in history to soft land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon when 'Jade Rabbit' launches next month.The gold-coloured model has six wheels and wing-like solar panels . Chinese scientists test the moon rover ahead of its launch. The six-wheeled Yutu vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years . The probe, which can climb inclines of up to 30 degrees and travel up to 200 metres per hour, is targeted to land within a huge volcanic crater known as Sinus Iridum, which means the Bay of Rainbows, on about December 14. 'Apart from launching astronauts into space, this is probably the most complex space mission attempted by China,' Australian space analyst Morris Jones told AFP. Yutu is designed to roam the lunar surface for at least 90 Earth days – three Lunar days – covering an area of about five square kilometres. It will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking high-resolution images of the rock, a flat area formed from the molten basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago. The journey of the Chang’e-3 probe and its final landing will be closely monitored by the European Space Agency (ESA), which is cooperating closely with China. ESA’s own launch station in Kourou, French Guiana, will immediately start receiving signals from the mission after take-off and it will upload commands to the probe on behalf of the Chinese control centre. 'Whether for human or robotic missions, international cooperation like this is necessary for the future exploration of planets, moons and asteroids, benefitting everyone,' said Thomas Reiter, director of ESA’s human spaceflight operations. Form: The first time China launched an unmanned spacecraft was in 1999, pictured. It is the only the third country to have done so, after Russia and the US . Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin Aldrin, right, walking on the moon, left, in 1969 . In recent years, China has made considerable progress in its space programme. In June, three Chinese astronauts spent 15 days in orbit and docked their craft with an experimental space laboratory. In 2007, the country despatched an unmanned spacecraft called Chang'e to orbit the Moon. The craft stayed in space for 16 months before being intentionally crashed on to the Moon's surface. The name Jade Rabbit was chosen after an online poll in which millions took part. Ouyang Ziyuan, head of the moon rover project, told Xinhua earlier this week that the ancient beliefs had their origins in the marks left by impacts on the lunar landscape. 'There are several black spots on the moon's surface. Our ancient people imagined they were a moon palace, osmanthus trees, and a jade rabbit,' he said. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, becoming the third country after Russia and the United States to achieve manned space travel independently. The military-backed space programme is a source of national pride. China is one of only three countries to have managed to independently send humans into space, the others being Russia and the US.","Country will tomorrow launch the first unmanned lunar probe since 1976 .

The orders will bar people from preaching messages of terror and hate, associating with . named individuals thought vulnerable to radicalisation, and from . entering specific venues, such as mosques or community halls - in a similar manner to the orders used to ban yobs from certain areas. The measures are part of an anti-extremism task force set up by . David Cameron after the death of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich. Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22,  have been convicted of the brutal murder of the young soldier. The pair were told they face life behind bars and will be sentenced in the new year. The Sunday Times reports that . Haitham al-Haddad, an Islamic scholar, is one preacher under scrutiny according to Whitehall officials. The Palestinian, who is now based in London, heaped praise on Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, after his death. In May 2011, he wrote: 'He . died as a Muslim and it is an established part of our Islamic creed . that every Muslim, unlike the disbelievers, will eventually enter . paradise.' Whitehall officials told the paper they knew of 25 preachers that operate as 'an informal network' which collects and coordinates around study centres, institutions and universities. They added that Anjem Choudary, a notorious hate preacher, is not one of the 25. The 45-year-old former leader of Islam4UK, a banned Islamist group, refused to condemn the actions of Adebolajo and Adebowale following their conviction, instead blaming the barbaric murder on British foreign policy.

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . Thousands of summer-born children will be able to start school a year later to stop them being disadvantaged by the age gap with their winter-born classmates. There is growing evidence that children born late in the academic year who start school at four are already at a disadvantage just 12 months later. Ministers have now sent guidance to schools and councils that could end the anguish of parents whose children are forced to start formal education at barely four. Under the new plan, children born in summer will be allowed to start at five (picture posed by models) They acted after becoming concerned about the number of disputes between education authorities and parents over the issue. The guidelines make it clear that parents have the right to request their summer-born children start reception classes at five instead. Schools and councils must consider the requests in light of ‘research into the outcomes of summer-born and premature children’. The advice applies to those born between April 1 and August 31. The Department for Education guidance says: ‘In recent months, an increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents, local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer-born child to start school.’ The advice, drawn up with help from parents, adds: ‘There are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class.’ Department for Education figures show 62 per cent of those born between May and August fail to meet minimum expected levels in areas such as reading, writing, speaking, maths and listening. Research has shown that summer-born children can be disadvantaged by going to school earlier than their winter classmates . By contrast, just 40 per cent of children born between September and December fall behind. The report said: ‘Month of birth has the largest impact on the literacy and mathematics areas of learning.’ Separate research has shown that, on average, summer-borns do worse at GCSE and A-level and are less likely to go to university. They are also more likely to be bullied and be unhappy at school. The Institute of Fiscal Studies says the disparity between September and August-born children is so great that summer-borns should be given weighted test results to compensate. Campaigners welcomed the guidance yesterday but called on ministers to go further and introduce an absolute right for summer-borns to start reception classes at five. Pauline Hull, 40, of Farnham, Surrey, wants her May-born son Jack to start school at five, but the county council has refused. She said some councils try to make summer-borns who wanted to start school later join year one instead of reception, forcing them to lose a year of education. Mrs Hull, 40, who helps run the group Flexible School Admissions For Summer Born Children, added: ‘Councils are worried about the floodgates opening.’ One private school is planning to start lessons at 1.30pm .","Ministers have sent schools guidance to allow summer-born children to start a year later .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . When and where did Neanderthals and modern humans first meet and interbreed? That's a question scientists will be hoping to answer with a treasure trove of important human fossils rediscovered by a team from the National History Museum in London. DNA analysis of the bones may shed light on the exodus of modern humans from Africa, and could confirm the Middle East as the meeting point for Neanderthals and humans. A significant haul of human fossils dating back 50,000 years have been rediscovered that could provide evidence as to how modern humanity began. The bones (pictured) were originally dug up in the 1920s and 1930s but had been lost until they were rediscovered by a team of National History Museum scientists . The collection consists of boxes of bones discovered among the personal belongings of Scottish anthropologist Sir Arthur Keith. Sir Keith was the Master at Buckston Brown Farm, a research station of the Royal College of Surgeons next to Charles Darwin's home, Down House, in Kent. After Sir Keith's death in 1955 a number of fossils were transferred from the collections at the Royal College of Surgeons to the Natural History Museum, but this particular collection did not arrive until 2001. It was not until the current study was carried out that the importance of his collection became clear. The study, published in Quaternary International, describes the work undertaken to identify and document the human skeletal material in the Keith Collection. It identified the human fossils as having come from a number of excavations directed by Dorothy Garrod in the 1920s and 1930s, in what is now Israel. Garrod was a female pioneer, the first woman to hold an Oxbridge Chair, and led a number of excavations at key archaeological sites in the Middle East such as Shukbah, El Wad, Tabun, Skhul and Kebara Caves. She relied on Sir Keith and Theodore McCown to carry out the morphological analysis of the skeletal material she discovered. Shukbah and El Wad were the first sites excavated and yielded primarily Late Upper Palaeolithic Natufian material, which was briefly described by Garrod and Keith. The study identified the human fossils as having come from a number of excavations directed by Dorothy Garrod in the 1920s and 1930s in what is now Israel (map shown).  Garrod led a number of excavations at key archaeological sites in the Middle East such as Shukbah, El Wad, Tabun, Skhul and Kebara Caves . Sir Arthur Keith (pictured left) was a Scottish anatomist and anthropologist who had in his possession a significant haul of human fossils. On first study, they had seemed uninteresting, but upon closer inspection they were revealed to be about 50,000-years-old. On the right is a fragment of a juvenile Neanderthal temporal bone . The older skeletal material belonging to Neanderthals and early modern humans was described by McCown and Keith in 1939 in the volume 'The Stone Age of Mount Carmel'. Detailed descriptions of most of the fossil material were included in the book, and were the only testament to their existence. 'We believe the collection became lost because the bombings of the Royal College of Surgeons in London made it necessary to transfer the material back to safety at Buckston Browne Farm, as well as McCown's move to Berkeley University, USA, in 1939,' said Dr Isabelle De Groote from the National History Museum. 'Some of the fossils date back to a key time period where Neanderthals and modern humans may have co-existed in the Middle East and Europe. 'Very few early modern human fossils exist that date to the late Middle Palaeolithic and the material is therefore very significant. 'It has the potential to answer important questions about the dispersal of anatomically modern humans out of Africa.' It was not until the current study was carried out that the importance of the collection, which was received by the National History Museum in 2001, became clear. Here heavy damage on bone, probably due to post-excavation mechanical cleaning using a metal instrument, is seen marked by white arrows . Professor Chris Stringer, co-author and Research Leader in Human Origins at the Natural History Museum, added: 'It's sometimes possible to make important finds through careful detective work on existing collections, rather than from new excavations, and this study is a great example of that. 'The material in question had been stored, unrecognised, for about 50 years until it arrived at the Museum in 2001. 'We now know that it not only contained the lost collection of modern human fossils from Shukbah Cave - the type site of the Natufian industry [10,000 to 15,000 years ago] in Israel - but also some more fragmentary, but equally important, fossils that may cover the period of overlap between the last Neanderthals and the first modern humans in Israel, some 50,000 years ago.' Europeans may be closer to their Neanderthal cousins than previously thought, recent research suggests. Breeding with Neanderthals has long been known to have left its traces in the DNA of modern Europeans. Earlier this year, scientists . in Edinburgh confirmed the genetic similarity between the . two must have arisen after interbreeding in Europe and Asia, before our . ancestors spread across the globe. Previous . research speculated that modern Europeans and Asians are related to . Neanderthals because they originated from a similar sub-population in . Africa. Both groups evolved from a common ancestor in Africa before spreading to other parts of the world. The . two groups emerged at different times with Neanderthals leaving the . African continent more than 200,000 years before humans did. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh and Wageningen University . found the species mated in Europe and Asia thousands of years ago. The . research involved dividing up the genetic code of each sub-species to . calculate the statistical likelihood of distant or recent interbreeding. They . traced the biological ties that exist between humans and the ancient . species which are believed to have died out around 30,000 years ago. The research found that the two per cent of neanderthal DNA which exists in people today came from the mating outside of Africa.","Fossils first found in the 1920s and 30s could reveal human history secrets .

"By . Mark Prigg . YouTube is set to launch a launch a new subscription music service - but is locked in a major row with independent artists over the plans. The company acknowledged the plans after being dragged into a public dispute over royalties that will result in the blockade of some independent artists' music videos. The Google owned video site said in a statement that it is 'adding subscription-based features for music on YouTube' and that 'hundreds of major label and independent artists' have signed on. Singer Adele, who is signed with Beggars Group's XL Recordings in the U.K., but Sony Music's Columbia label in the U.S. could see her music banned from YouTube in some territories over the deal. The paid service, to be launched within a few months, will likely allow playback of videos without ads and allow for offline playback on mobile devices. That's according to two people familiar with the matter. The people weren't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The people also confirmed that a small number of independent artists who had not agreed to new deal terms will have their videos blocked in some countries starting in a few days, even on the free version of YouTube. YouTube will block the music videos so users of the test version won't be confused about which content they can access for free and with features require payment, the people said. Allowing free streams of music by certain artists while not offering them on the paid service would erode the value of the paid plan, one person said. The move also adds pressure on those labels to sign, because not being on YouTube altogether will result in less advertising revenue and exposure. YouTube has reached deals with all three major music labels — Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group — and many independent labels as a whole representing about 95 percent of all labels, the people said. Determining which artists are blocked —and where— could be confusing because some indie artists have their music distributed in certain countries by the major labels. Singer Adele, for instance, is signed with Beggars Group's XL Recordings in the U.K., but Sony Music's Columbia label distributes her music in the U.S. YouTube has reached deals with all three major music labels ¿ Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group ¿ and many independent labels as a whole representing about 95 percent of all labels, it has been claimed. Independent labels are being offered the same per-stream royalty payment as the major labels, but are not offered the same guarantees or advances for the first year. Rich Bengloff, president of the American Association of Independent Music, an industry group representing independent labels, said he disagrees with the characterization that only a few labels haven't signed. He argued that independent artists are being treated unfairly simply because they lack market power. 'I'm not very happy, obviously,' he said. 'We're asking to be treated equitably and fairly.' One person familiar with the terms said that independent labels are being offered the same per-stream royalty payment as the major labels, but are not offered the same guarantees or advances for the first year. Alison Wenham, CEO of the Worldwide Independent Network, another trade group representing indie labels, said in a statement that YouTube's decision to blockade some labels was a 'grave error of commercial judgment.' She said services like Spotify and Deezer have done a better job representing independent music on their platforms. BPI Chief Executive, Geoff Taylor said: 'We think it is wrong for YouTube/Google to threaten to ostracise certain independents - denying fans the opportunity to hear their music, and labels and artists the chance to earn a living from it - because they are unwilling to surrender to a take it or leave it ultimatum. 'As the dominant online video platform, YouTube/Google should negotiate fully and fairly with independents and not misuse its power.'","Google accused of 'misusing its power' in negotiations .

"By . Sam Webb . Graham Daniels, the head teacher at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bryn Tawe in Swansea is no longer at the helm while an alleged 'sex tape' recorded in the school is investigated . A headteacher has been relieved of his duties after a video emerged on YouTube that allegedly captures the sound of people engaged in sexual activity at a secondary school in Wales. Governors at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bryn Tawe in Swansea have announced that the deputy headteacher has been placed in charge temporarily after the video emerged, replacing headteacher Graham Daniels, 50. The 34-second clip shows a red-carpeted administrative area with several closed wooden doors. It appears to be recorded outside an office at the school and noises of a seemingly sexual nature can be heard from the other side of the door. It is not known when the clip was filmed and whether it is genuine but it was shared on social media sites including YouTube where it was viewed hundreds of times before being removed. A council spokesman refused to comment on whether Mr Daniels was suspended or voluntarily stepped down. He declined to comment on the 'sex tape' recorded by pupils at his school. The headteacher was not at his detached bungalow in Ammanford, West Wales, today. His wife Heledd, 50, answered the door of their £350,000 home, with a private drive and sweeping views of a picturesque wooded valley. The mother-of-three said her husband was out and said she did not want to speak about the case. But Mr Daniels later answered his mobile phone and said: 'I do not wish to comment.' Governors at the school, which teaches pupils between the ages of 11 and 18 have launched an investigation. They are studying the video, now taken off Youtube, to discover who was in the office at the time. A special assembly has been held at Bryn Tawe School in Swansea to tell pupils to ignore the video and focus on their exams. A council spokesman refused to comment on whether Mr Daniels was suspended or voluntarily stepped down from his role at the school, pictured . They have been told there is an external investigation underway and the matter will be dealt with 'in the fairest way possible'. Pupils have been sharing the 30-second video on social networking websites including Facebook and Twitter. But . they have now been banned from talking about it on Twitter and Facebook . after being accused of 'damaging the school's reputation'. Dozens of . postings on social media sites refer to the video, with one poster . writing on Twitter: 'I literally can’t believe this! Sounds like a soap . opera!' Parents have also been left outraged after their children showed them the clip. One angry father said: 'I am seriously considering moving my children from the school. The audio of the alleged sex act was taped by a pupil and is now a Facebook sensation. 'It has been shared with a number of pupils and parents have made a complaint after seeing it. 'Pupils have been asked to delete the video but this needs to be publicised to ensure the matter is not covered up.' School chair of governors Heini Gruffudd said: 'The school has received a complaint which did not name anyone involved. 'Following this the governing body is holding an investigation in co-operation with the local authority. 'Mr Simon Davies, currently deputy headteacher at the school, will be managing the school for the time being. 'The school is running normally and we won’t be commenting further at this time.' A Swansea Council spokesman last week said it would be 'inappropriate to comment' on the claims. The school’s latest Estyn report, following an inspection in March last year, saw Bryn Tawe handed a rare ‘double-excellent’. The Welsh-medium secondary school, which has around 750 pupils on roll, was praised by inspectors who described the quality and consistency of teaching at the institution as 'exceptional features'. The school, which opened in 2003, was last September ranked the top school in Wales . Pupils’ behaviour was also applauded while inspectors said the prospects for continued improvement were excellent. The report added: 'The vision and strategic direction provided by the headteacher is excellent, with a clear and sustained focus on maintaining and achieving high standards. 'The headteacher is supported by an enthusiastic senior management team. 'The effect of the senior management team’s work permeates every aspect of school life. 'They are extremely good line managers who insist upon high and consistent expectations.' The school, which opened in 2003, was last September ranked the top school in Wales as part of league table rankings compiled by WalesOnline.","Deputy head has temporarily taken over running of the Swansea school .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong El Niños are expected to double, according to new research. Climate scientists have warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts, wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years. The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent and the event in 1997 cost between $35billion to $45billion in damage. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. Here, the village of Puerto Maldonado, Peru, is seen flooded in January 2003 as a result of El Niño rains, which drove 16,000 people from their homes . Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Ninos, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns. The new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others. Extreme El Niño events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years. The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent. An international team of scientists from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (CoECSS), the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and CSIRO, has spotted a link between global warming and extreme El Niño events. ‘We currently experience an unusually strong El Niño event every 20 years. Our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years,’ said Agus Santoso of CoECSS, who co-authored the study. ‘El Nino events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming,’ he added. Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Ninos, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Scientists in Germany recently said they can forecast disruptive El Niño events a year in advance. They hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires, pictured in the Philippines. Meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 El Niño will be firmed up 'in the next month or two' This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns, which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others. Mike McPhaden of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the question of how global warming will change the frequency of extreme El Niño events has challenged scientists for more than 20 years. ‘This research is the first comprehensive examination of the issue to produce robust and convincing results,’ he said. The impacts of extreme El Niño events extend to every continent across the globe killed an around 23,000 people in the 1997 event. Wenju Cai, lead author of the study from CSIRO, said: ‘During an extreme El Niño event countries in the western Pacific, such as Australia and Indonesia, experienced devastating droughts and wild fires, while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of Ecuador and northern Peru.’ The scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme El Niño events. This satellite image shows the El Nino weather phenomena in 1997, represented by the the white area at the equator, which shows how the warm waters stretch from Peru to Alaska . In Australia, the drought and dry conditions caused by the 1982-1983 extreme El Niño led to the Ash Wednesday Bushfire in southeast Australia, which resulted in 75 deaths. The scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme El Niño events. They found a ‘substantial’ increase in events from the present-day through the next 100 years as the eastern Pacific Ocean warms in response to global warming. Professor Matthew England, a co-author from CoECSS, said: ‘This latest research based on rainfall patterns, suggests that extreme El Niño events are likely to double in frequency as the world warms leading to direct impacts on extreme weather events worldwide.’ ‘For Australia, this could mean summer heat waves, like that recently experienced in the south-east of the country, could get an additional boost if they coincide with extreme El Niños,’ he added. The impact of this year's El Niño events is expected to be felt by every continent. During the 1997 to 1998 events, damages were said to have been in the region of between $35billion to $45billion.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . New sex abuse claims against Jimmy Savile are being made weekly, it emerged today as the number of hospitals under investigation over the scandal more than doubled to 32. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said an extra 19 hospitals had been caught up in the scandal, in addition to 13 already subject to an urgent inquiry. It suggests the disgraced former BBC . presenter’s abuse of children on NHS premises may have been more regular . and more serious than those offences committed at the Corporation. Inquiry: The scope of NHS investigations into abuse by former BBC presenter Jimmy Savile has been widened again . Investigations were first launched into . Savile's activities at Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General Infirmary when details of his years of abuse emerged last year. It was then widened to include 10 hopsitals across the country. But in a written statement today, Mr Hunt said that Scotland Yard inquiries had unearthed more claims of abuse at another 19 hospitals. They include Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds, London and Whitby. Detectives investigating the cases of . abuse gleaned further information that patients at the 19 hospitals . could have been targeted by Savile and so further inquiries were . ordered. The 19 additional hospitals under investigation are:Barnet General HospitalBooth Hall Children's HospitalDe La Pole HospitalDryburn Hospital Hammersmith HospitalLeavesden Secure Mental HospitalMarsden HospitalMaudsley HospitalNorth Manchester General HospitalOdstock HospitalPinderfields HospitalPrestwich Psychiatric HospitalQueen Victoria Hospital, East GrinsteadRoyal Free Hospital, LondonRoyal Victoria Infirmary, NewcastleSeacroft Hospital, LeedsSt Mary's Hospital, CarshaltonWhitby Memorial HospitalWythenshawe Hospital . Mr Hunt said former barrister Kate Lampard, who was asked to oversee the Department of Health's investigations into Savile, will make sure the inquiries are properly carried out. Mr Hunt said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service has completed its document review and transferred various material concerning Jimmy Savile and the NHS to the Department of Health. ""The information has been passed on to the relevant hospital trust for further investigation as appropriate. Names of the hospitals are taken from the information received. 'These include hospitals that may have closed in which case the information has been passed on to the legacy organisation. 'Kate Lampard, who was asked to provide independent assurance of the NHS investigations on behalf of the Department of Health, will provide general assurance of the quality of all reports in her final assurance report. 'We expect the final reports of all the investigations to be completed by June 2014, with publication sooner if that is possible.' Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is . believed to have abused hundreds of children. He had a bedroom at Stoke . Mandeville Hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and . widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary. The . wave of allegations made against him sparked the launch of the . Operation Yewtree police investigation, which is also looking into . claims about others linked to him as well as separate allegations about a . number of high-profile figures. Lawyers say they are receiving fresh claims against Savile every week. Alan Collins, who is acting for about 80 alleged victims of the disgraced presenter, told the Standard: 'People are still coming forward. We are getting half a dozen new queries a week in connection with Savile and other people.' He has been interviewing the latest alleged victim who is a woman who now lives in Los Angeles. The Royal Free Hospital in London and North Manchester General Hospital are among the hospitals now under investigation . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said reports into the scale of Savile's campaign of abuse in hospitals will be published by June next year . Lawyers representing some of his victims have claimed Savile's offences on NHS property were just as bad as those committed on the BBC premises and in some cases much worse. Liz . Dux, head of abuse at Slater and Gordon Lawyers, who represents 72 . potential Savile victims, said in October: 'While the victims are encouraged by . news that the NHS inquiries will be comprehensive investigations of . other institutions that may have been involved, the news that the . time-frame for concluding the investigation has been extended until next . June will be met with dismay. 'My . clients all need closure and whilst we welcome a detailed understanding . of how Savile was able to operate unchecked for so many years, at the . same time we need to recognise that until these reports are concluded . their suffering continues.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'It is essential that all the information is considered and investigations are thorough in order to learn the lessons about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending.'

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . Under the new syllabus, students would be expected to study how controversial comedian Russell Brand, pictured, used language in different contexts . Teenagers could study the language of Russell Brand and Dizzee Rascal under controversial plans for a new English A-level. The proposals, by the OCR board, provoked a storm at the Department for Education, while one campaign group calls them ‘dumbed down’. Under the new syllabus, students would be expected to study how Brand, a former heroin addict, used language in different contexts, such as when he gave evidence to MPs on drugs policy. Senior sources said examiners must be ‘having a laugh’ if they believed the A-level would be allowed into schools. Exams watchdog Ofqual will make a final decision on whether the syllabus should be accredited for use in sixth-forms across the country. OCR said the new qualification - a combined A-level in English language and literature - aimed to expose teenagers to a broad range of styles and genres. Examiners insisted that classics of English literature such as Shakespeare, William Blake, George Orwell and Charlotte Bronte would also feature strongly. But elements of the course were condemned as ‘dumbing down’ yesterday. Candidates will be expected to study how comedian Brand - a former heroin addict - used language as he gave evidence to MPs about drugs policy. During his appearance before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, he said drug addiction should not be seen as a crime but a disease and called for Britain to ‘look into’ decriminalisation. He also joked with MPs, who asked him if he had been arrested ‘roughly’ 12 times for possession of drugs. Brand replied: ‘Yes, it was rough’. The syllabus also features an interview with Dizzee Rascal on BBC2’s Newsnight, when Jeremy Paxman referred to the rapper as ‘Mr Rascal’. OCR said candidates would be asked to comment on ‘mode, purpose and audience’. Further . texts to be studied include the Twitter feed of author and blogger . Caitlin Moran, the musings of the Secret Footballer and speeches by . artist Grayson Perry. Teenagers will also tackle the memoir which inspired the Oscar-winning film Twelve Years a Slave. Students could also study the language used by Rapper Dizzee Rascal, pictured, under the controversial proposals . Further texts to be studied under the plans include speeches by artist Grayson Perry, pictured . OCR hopes the qualification will be introduced in schools in September next year. It was developed after Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered a radical overhaul of all GCSEs and A-levels to restore public faith in exam standards and put an end to grade inflation. But the proposed new course - one of many due to presented for accreditation over the coming months - is unlikely to be considered rigorous enough to be accepted. A senior DfE source said: ‘This is exactly the kind of dumbing down we are trying to get rid of.‘They must be having a laugh if they think A-levels in Dizzee Rascal and Russell Brand are going to be let through.’ Extracts from interviews with Brand and the rapper feature in an anthology which pupils will be required to study in detail and answer questions on to achieve 16 per cent of their A-level marks. There will be opportunities in class to assess Brand’s language in different contexts. Further musings by Brand could feature as part of ‘unseen’ texts that pupils will be questioned on as part of a written paper. OCR insisted the anthology had been deliberately conceived as a historical sweep from the 17th century to the present day. The qualification was developed after Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered a radical overhaul of all GCSEs and A-levels to restore public faith in exam standards and put an end to grade inflation . Hester Glass, OCR subject specialist for English, said: ‘By creating a new model with a linguistic approach to literary texts, we aim to set a new gold standard to transform the A-level into a more valuable, distinctive qualification. ‘It will provide a firm grounding for university and improve employability in any field that requires an ability to use language in a practical, agile and articulate way - from science, business or politics to the arts.’ The course has been developed in conjunction with the English and Media Centre, which provides training for English teachers. Barbara Bleiman, co-director of the English and Media Centre, which provides training for English teachers, said the course would ‘excite and inspire teachers with the power of the English language’. ‘The new A-level will introduce new approaches and scope for more creative writing, while offering teachers and students the flexibility to explore an extremely broad variety of styles, methodologies and genres,’ she said. The bar needs to be raised above Russell Brand’s head . But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the course smacked of an attempt to appeal to youngsters with ‘fashionable’ and ‘trendy’ themes. ‘It looks as if boards are continuing with their policy of making subjects relevant and accessible but our experience of what this means in practice is dumbing down,’ he said. ‘The bar needs to be raised above Russell Brand’s head. ‘There are plenty of contemporary texts that could be seriously studied. ‘When pupils in China, Singapore and other high-performing countries sit down to study English they won’t be turning to Russell Brand, rappers and Tweets.’ A DfE spokesman said: ‘All new A levels must be accredited by the independent exams regulator Ofqual against new, more rigorous criteria. This exam has not been accredited and we await Ofqual’s decision with interest.’","Teenagers could be asked to study language of Russell Brand and Dizzee Rascal .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Prison Officers' Association head Steve Gillan has said that an increasing number of prisoners are becoming 'convenience Muslims' leading to heightened tensions with guards and fuelling extremism . Rising numbers of prisoners are becoming 'convenience Muslims' leading to heightened tensions with guards and fuelling extremism, the head of the Prison Officers' Association has warned. Union general secretary Steve Gillan said that many prisoners were turning to Islam to win benefits, and to gain the status associated with being part of a gang. He said prison staff were coming under threat from groups of Muslims on a daily basis, and warned that young prisoners were at risk of being radicalised while behind bars. In 1991 there were 1,957 Muslims serving prison sentences in England and Wales, but numbers had risen to 11,683 by 2013. Mr Gillan said that many converts, who are known as 'convenience Muslims', changed faiths because it meant they were entitled to more time outside of their cells and offered better food. Muslim prisoners are also excluded from work and education on Fridays so they can attend prayers. Mr Gillan said that others wanted the status and security of being part of a particular group while in prison, and that it was relatively common for prisoners to leave Islam upon their release. 'Some people also believe that it is better to have a cult status and belong to a particular gang . 'What we've got to guard against is the real threat of the extremists and the radicalisation of young, disaffected prisoners,' Mr Gillan told The Times. 'They are the extremists of tomorrow.' Mr Gillan's comments came as two Muslim prisoners who were already serving life sentences for murder were found guilty of making threats to kill an officer during a siege at HMP Full Sutton, near York, in the days after the death of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Feroz Khan and Fuad Awale, both 26, were convicted of threatening Richard Thompson, with Khan also found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the guard. Feroz Khan (left) and Fuad Awale (right), both 26, were convicted of threatening Richard Thompson, with Khan also found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the guard . Both men, along with another prisoner, David Watson, 27, had been accused of holding Mr Thompson hostage on May 26 last year, and demanding the release of radical . preacher Abu Qatada and Roshonara Choudhry, a student who attempted to stab MP Stephen Timms . to death in 2010. They were also accused of demanding to be flown to Afghanistan, the jury heard. However, they were cleared of the false imprisonment, and Khan was found not guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against another officer, Rachel Oxtoby. The trial at the Old Bailey had heard that relations between prison staff and some of the Muslim inmates 'became strained' in the days after Fusilier Rigby was murdered. The court was told that Khan had planned the attack after telling another guard that it was a . Muslim's duty to 'fight until Sharia law is established in every . country'. Jury members also heard that Khan and Awale targeted Mr Thompson, believing him to be ex-British military, and that Khan had beaten the guard, fracturing his eye socket before threatening to kill him. As Mr Thompson was pinned to his chair Awale pointed a sharp implement by his throat and said: 'Stop struggling, I've killed two people - I'll kill you'. The trial at the Old Bailey had heard that relations between prison staff at HMP Full Sutton (pictured) and some of the Muslim inmates 'became strained' in the days after Fusilier Rigby was murdered . Khan had told jurors he planned to take a prison guard hostage in order to stage a high profile terrorist incident 'perfectly timed' with the murder of Drummer Rigby. The convict claimed that he acted in the days after the soldier's death so he could gain maximum media exposure.He said he was in 'constant fear' of his life following a rise in tension on Echo Wing and that he felt threatened by prison staff and non-Muslim inmates in the wake of the Woolwich murder. Khan, Awale and Watson were all serving life sentences for murder at the time of the incident, and all three had become devout Muslims following their convictions. Khan told jurors he planned to take a prison guard hostage to stage a high profile terrorist incident 'perfectly timed' with the murder of Drummer Rigby (pictured) On February 26, 2007, Khan shot his . friend Skander Rehman in the back of the head at point blank range after . luring him to a park in Bradford - wrongly believing he was having an . affair with his wife. Somali-born Awale was convicted in Janurary last year of the double murder of two teenagers, Mohammed Abdi Farah, 19, and Amin Ahmed Ismail, 18, who were shot in a Milton Keynes drug war on May 26, 2011. Watson, a white Muslim convert, stabbed to death a security guard at a HMV store in Norwich's Chapelfield shopping centre after being caught with a stolen CD on December 18, 2006. The drug dealer murdered Paul Cavanagh after fearing police would find £10,000 of crack cocaine he had in a carrier bag. Khan and Awale were told they would be sentenced next week. The Muslim prison population has increased since 2009 by nearly 1,500 – 550 of those in the last 12 months alone. The court was told that one in three prisoners at Full Sutton are Muslim. At Long Lartin in Worcestershire the proportion is 20 per cent and in Whitemoor, a top-security prison in Cambridgeshire, more than four in ten prisoners are Muslim. In Belmarsh prison in London, which houses Lee Rigby murderers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, one in three inmates is a Muslim. Mr Gillan said: 'Incidents like that at Full Sutton are becoming more and more of a daily threat. Prison officers regularly raise issues about Muslim radicalism and the concerns they have about doing their jobs generally against [a backdrop of] gang culture.'","Prison Officers' Association head says inmates are turning to Islam to win benefits and gain status .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Jailed: Darrel Bingham, 51, claimed his sadistic actions were inspired by Fifty Shades of Grey . A former soldier who blackmailed his young lover into depraved sex acts was inspired by Fifty Shades of Grey, he claims. Darrell Bingham, 51, said the months of sadistic role play was the idea of his 21-year-old girlfriend, who saw herself as naive Anastasia Steele who is forcefully controlled by her older boyfriend as Christian Grey. The best-selling 'mummy porn' novels, set to hit cinema screens next year, follow the affair of a couple who enjoy consensual, dominating sex. For six months, Bingham, acting under two fake Facebook accounts, blackmailed his real-life girlfriend into performing sex acts over a web cam - posing as an American footballer called Grant and a man called Chad, Hull Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Joanne Kidd told the court: 'He played with her like a cat would a mouse.' Bingham, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, threatened to post her naked pictures to her work colleagues if she disobeyed his other demands. His demands escalated, culminating . in a request to get the victim's 15-year-old sister involved. Distraught, she broke down in tears at work. Colleagues called the . police, who traced the online exchanges back to Bingham. Bingham, who was originally found guilty after a first trial last year, told the appeal hearing it was simply role play to 'spice up' their relationship and that his then 21-year-old girlfriend knew Chad was him all along. But the jury found Bingham guilty of all . seven charges of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without . consent. He was jailed for seven years. Defending, Edward Bindloss . said: 'If Christian, the character in the novel, was being done for . assault, it wouldn't matter if it was a tap or much worse, getting viler . and viler, if she was in on it.' Traumatised: The woman, 21, broke down at work when 'Chad' told her to perform with her 15-year-old sister . However, Ms Kidd said Bingham made up the fact it was role play after a successful appeal against his original conviction on a technicality and it was never mentioned in his original trial or in police interview. Referring to Yahoo chat conversations between 'Chad' and the victim, Ms Kidd said: 'Do you consider they smack of some elaborate sexual role play to spice up the sex life? Or do you read the responses as those from a terrified young woman, being frightened to death?' She told the jury he was clutching at straws and alarm bells should be ringing. The court heard jealous Bingham created Grant to befriend the woman on Facebook in early 2010. Posing as Grant, he pestered her for a topless photograph, which she sent. He then threatened her and made further demands. Eventually, the woman confided in her boyfriend Bingham, a former soldier, not realising he was behind the threats. Telling her to carry on, he said he would go to meet 'Grant' in Pontefract to 'sort him out'. Taylor was jailed for two years at Hull Crown Court (pictured) after pleading guilty to burglary . Bingham then showed his girlfriend a Google image of a man tied up with a gun to his head, claiming he had murdered 'Grant' and she believed him. Three weeks after 'Grant' was murdered, 'Chad' began messaging her and continued the blackmail, claiming 'Grant' had sent him the images of her. Mr Bindloss said the woman had 'manipulated ""Grant""' into meeting her so subsequent acts were consensual and claimed they created 'Chad' together following the 'excitement' of the previous alias. But Ms Kidd said: 'He wanted to appear to be her knight in shining armour. His motivation was to plant himself so firmly in her life that she would love him and trust him. He manipulated her so she relied on him and only him.' When she was told it was Bingham all along, the woman 'collapsed in hysterics'. Ms Kidd said: 'It may be suggested, how could anyone believe Grant and Chad were real? But put that on its head. 'How can anyone believe a boyfriend could be so cruel and desperately manipulative to expose you to this sexual deprivation and humiliation?'","Darrell Bingham, 51, was jailed for seven years for non-consensual sex .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Two fathers who had their young sons kidnapped and taken to Europe by their mother, who they had both been married to, are now telling the incredible story about how they got their boys back. Larry Hummel and Bob Pfeifer launched a transatlantic hunt for their children after mother Maria Pfeifer spirited them away to Europe in 2012. Sasha Hummel, 4, and Robert 'Jerry' Pfeifer, 10, were returned to the US in December after the men were tipped off that they were living in France, where they had been disguised as girls. But the boys' mother claims they should still be living with her. Relief: Two fathers, Larry Hummel and Bob Pfeifer, fought to find their sons Sasha, 4, (right) and Jerry, 10, (left)   for 18 months after their mother kidnapped them and hid them in Europe in 2012 . Disguise? The fathers were shocked after video taken during the period with their mother (in orange shorts, center) showed the youngest child wearing pigtails (left) Happier times: Larry Hummel was married to Maria Pfeifer and had a son called Sasha . Previous love: Maria was also married to Bob Pfeifer and they also had a son - Robert 'Jerry' Pfeifer . Happy father: Larry Hummel finally got his son Sasha back in the US in December 2013 . Reunited: Robert Pfeifer and his son Robert 'Jerry' Pfeifer, 10, walk at LAX after arriving from France, Saturday, December 28, 2013 . Now the fathers have explained how they hunted for their children until last December when the FBI told him they had found Sasha and his older brother living in France under false names. And as the men explained to ABC News the video that shocked them showed footage of the boys with their mother at a campsite in Slovakia. Both boys had long blond hair and the youngest boy even had pigtails, so the men think that their mother was trying to disguise their sons as girls. Mother Maria Pfeifer had taken the children from Los Angeles to a court-approved vacation in eastern Europe but never returned. After having no success in tracking down their children for the first year the fathers turned to a huge social media campaign all over Europe. 'We would take a photo and the message in the native language and literally post it on every Facebook page in the target area, whether it was a bar, a hair dresser, an entertainer,' Pfeifer said. 'Thousands of hours went into this,' he added. Hopes: Maria told ABC's 20/20 that she wants her boys back . Never give up: The fathers organized a huge social media campaign to try and find their children, and Pfeifer even went to the US Embassy in Paris without an appointment to enlist the help of the FBI . Return: Maria said she is willing to face criminal charges in the US to have a chance at getting custody of her children . Pfeifer pressed two felony counts of Child Detention with Right to Custody against his former wife. After a tip-off from one of Maria's friends that she might be with the boys in Paris, Pfeifer flew to the French capital. The . desperate father then walked into the the US Embassy - without an . appointment - and showed his investigations to FBI special agent Eugene . Casey. Agent Casey immediately started on the case and, at the end of 2013, it all paid off. In December, Hummel told the Los Angeles Daily News: 'I’ve lived this moment in my head for 18 months and to actually have it come true and be able to pick him up, bring him home, put him in my bed... it’s unbelievable.' Yet Maria Pfeifer says that she wants her sons back and is planning to return to Los Angeles in the near future. On ABC's 20/20 on Friday night the tearful mother she said that is willing to face criminal charges back in the US if it means a chance of getting some custody of the children. But last year Hummel explained to the New York Daily News that having young Sasha back in his life is ‘magical.’ ‘It's . beyond great. I was worried because we hadn't seen each other for so . long, but all my fears about him not recognizing me are over. 'It's the best, like he never left,’ the overjoyed father told the paper. At last! Bob Pfeifer was overjoyed to get his son back in December 2013, after 18 months away . Back home: Mr Hummel is pictured taking his child Saturday through Los Angeles International Airport in December . Happy child: Sasha pictured back in the US . ‘She was basically on the run, paying for everything in wads of cash and forcing the boys to live like refugees in Slovakia, Germany, Switzerland and France,’ said Mr Hummel. The feds tracked her down after an anonymous tip shifted their focus to France, and then to a town on the border with Switzerland. The boys’ fugitive mother had grown out their hair and changed their names. Mr Hummel believed she was also turning tricks as a prostitute to make ends meet, something she had a history of in the past, he said. Court records cited by the Daily News revealed Ms Pfiefer was acquitted in 2010 of escorting without a license and a second count of prostitution was dropped. Wanted: Authorities released this wanted poster asking for help locating the children and their fugitive mother . Together again: Mr Hummel and his son look as happy as ever . Both Mr Hummel and Robert Pfeifer, the father of the older boy, worked to bring the children home – and they finally had success. ‘I was really nervous about how much Sasha would remember because he was only three when he was taken, and I knew he'd be seeing me for the first time totally out of context in France,’ Mr Hummel recalled to the paper. ‘Within 10 minutes, we were playing together like old chums,’ he added. Both men were married to the supposed prostitute for less than year, he explained. The two fathers plan to keep the children close and allow them to see each other often. Their mother is out on bail in France and faces extradition to the US to face charges of abduction. Despite her facing jail time, Mr Hummel expressed hopes to the paper that she would ‘face the music’ so she could eventually ‘get back in Sasha's life.’","Larry Hummel's four-year-old son and Bob Pfeifer's ten-year-old were taken to eastern Europe in 2012 by his mother .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A heroic father saved his two-year-old son this weekend from two dogs that were chewing on his face after straying into the yard behind the family home. Colton Brown’s rescue from the vicious beasts by dad James Hardegree likely saved the his life while mother watched in horror, screaming as a Rottweiler and a Labrador repeatedly chomped on his head. Pictures posted by mother Lindsay Brown to Facebook how the horrifying extent of the injuries suffered by the tot, including a 4 and a half inch gash across the side of his face, puncture wounds and an ear mangled so bad doctors had to perform plastic surgery to fix it. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGE BELOW . Heroic father: James Hardegree (left) rescued son Colton Brown from two vicious dogs in their backyard . ‘He had 4 1/2 inch gash in his face all the way to the bone. On this side, his ear, two deep puncture wounds,’ the mother told WSB. Father James Hardegree told the station he locked Colton Brown in the house when he saw the two canines fighting over a dead animal they saw in the woods. But the young boy knew how to open the door and was soon tangled at the waist in a seven-foot-long chain being dragged by the Rottweiler. ‘He came running back out, he got tangled up in the chain of the [Rottweiler], it all just happened so fast,’ he told WAGA. ‘He was just up under them, and they were fighting, and whether or not they meant to get him – they did.’ Savage beasts: Two dogs similar to the Rottweiler on the left and the Labrador on the right went after the tot . The dogs were mauling the young boy as Hardegree ran to his aid. Lucky: Colton Brown's life was likely saved by his father's heroic actions . He ran outside and chased the dogs away, but it was too late to spare his son from serious injury, but his heroic actions may have saved the boy’s life. The surgeon had to reattach Colton Brown’s left cheek and ear, the procedure took two hours, the family said. ‘Breaks my heart that instead of my baby having [an] awesome day, he is stuck in a hospital and is hurt badly, no child should go [through] this,’ the distraught mother wrote to Facebook. Hardegree chased the dogs away, and animal control officers have not seen them since. Officials are still hunting for both the dogs and their owner. Doctors told Colton Brown’s parents that not finding the dogs within another day or two will force them to require the toddler to get a rabies shot. It is not possible to determine if the dogs were infected with the deadly disease without first locating them. The young boy has been released from the hospital, but Lindsay Brown told WAGA she is upset over the ordeal. ‘You shouldn't have a home and worry that something is going to happen to your child in your own backyard.’","Colton Brown's head was in the clenched jaws of two dogs when his father ran out to save his life .

"By . Rob Preece . Shops are boarded up, the buildings look tatty and roads are littered with discarded mattresses, cupboards and wardrobes. Welcome to the side of Stratford, east London, that Olympic organisers would rather you didn't see. London was awarded the 2012 Games after the team behind the bid convinced officials that it would leave a lasting legacy for the regeneration of one of the capital's poorest areas. But these grim pictures, taken only a stone's throw from the Olympic Park, reveal that more work is needed to turn around Stratford's fortunes. Discarded: Mattresses and furniture line a pavement in Stratford, where some residents are struggling to see how their area has benefited from the Olympics . Tatty: A newsagent's shop in Stratford has its window boarded up . Damaging: This street has a view of the Olympic stadium, but a crashed car has been abandoned on the pavement . Almost £9.3billion has been spent on the Games - with three-quarters of it earmarked for regeneration projects - but some residents say it is hard to see where the money has gone. The area has a new £1.45billion shopping mall, Westfield, which has created 10,000 jobs and brought new waves of shoppers. The athletes' village is believed to have cost about £1.1billion to build, although it was sold to Qatari developers last year for only £557million. But critics fear other parts of Stratford have been forgotten. Julian Cheyne, of the Counter Olympics Network, a pressure group set up to hold London 2012 officials to account, said: 'You look at the old Stratford Centre and it is dwarfed by the new glistening Westfield. 'Westfield is a stark contrast to the town centre that's for sure. They have placed some turquoise sculptures in Stratford, but that's about it.' The Olympic 'Orbit' statue overlooks a building in need of refurbishment . Closed: A statue on the Olympic Park stands behind businesses with their shutters down . The dour exterior of the old shopping centre is a world away form the bright Westfield complex. And the town's high street is peppered with shut-down shops and closing down sales. Mr Cheyne said: 'You could argue that there is no need to spruce it up because I doubt many visitors to the Olympics will ever bother to venture outside the Park. 'They will just get the tube or train straight to Stratford and turn left into the Olympic complex. A bed shop is closed with shutters drawn down in Stratford town centre . 'It's questionable what tarting up . the area would actually do for the fortunes of the businesses. They will . just be inconvenienced by the Games.' The Government promise to use the Olympics to inspire young people has come under attack after it emerged that just one in eight 16-to-24 year-olds have tickets for the Games. Most people in that age group will not be attending any Olympic Games events, the research found. Figures show stark regional differences in the uptake of tickets, with only 3 per cent of youngsters from the north-east of England going to events. This compares with 21 per cent of young people from the London region, according to the study by specialist market research consultancy YouthSight. Youthsight's managing director, Ben Marks, said: 'If the Olympic Games were intended to inspire young people, maybe there could have been a way to prioritise and perhaps discount their ticket applications. 'Ticket discounts only applied to those aged 16 and under.' Shopkeeper Uday Patel, who runs a newsagent business in the Stratford Centre opposite Westfield, said: 'Money needs to be invested in the Stratford Centre, not just the Olympic Park. 'It doesn't impact locals if not. How are we meant to compete? 'The least the council could do is lower our rates so we can be more competitive because business has been affected badly.' Residents said the changes they had seen so far were cosmetic. Joe Alexander said: 'I'm glad Westfield is there, it's a great local facility for the people of Stratford but you can't help feel it was created more for people from outside to come in, shop and leave without really entering the real Stratford. 'It has been given its own district - E20 - and that helps create this idea that it is a separate from the town. 'I don't think the regeneration and tidying up that's happened before the Olympics has really had much impact on the wider Stratford area.' Another resident, Doreen Ward, added: 'All the money seems to be going into the Olympic Park and the new shopping centre. 'From . our perspective it's as though they are making sure the visitors get a . good impression of Stratford, but all the existing facilities across the . road in the town centre are still run down but out of sight. 'They . did put some nice flower beds in the town centre the other day, so that . is a start - but it still needs a good lick of paint and a lot of love . and attention.' The £1.45bn Westfield shopping mall has brought a huge boost, but critics fear other parts of Stratford have been forgotten . Appeal: Traders have called for more money to be invested in the Stratford Centre, which has been overshadowed by the new Westfield development . However, nearby Leyton High Road has already undergone a remarkable transformation as it reaps rewards from the Olympic project. Within a few months, a line of tatty shopfronts has been converted into a parade more typical of Chelsea or Notting Hill than the East End of London. 3 The number of times London has held the Olympic Games (1908, 1948 and 2012) 30 New bridges built inside the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London . 200 Number of buildings that had to be demolished to accommodate the site . 587 Acreage of Olympic Park . 3,000 Square footage of world's biggest McDonald's - just 200 yards from stadium . 200,000 Total workforce needed . 700,000 Total capacity for all venues . 4billion People expected to watch the Opening Ceremony . 9.3billion cost in pounds sterling of staging the Games . Shop names in charmless neon or plastic have been replaced with hand-painted signs adorned with elegant calligraphy or old-fashioned metal lettering. Even the local KFC has had its ugly plastic fascia replaced with a sophisticated dark red paint job, a smaller, subtler logo, and a smart new awning. Most of the businesses were fitted with internal shutters – sitting just within the windows rather than outside them – so the shopfronts can stay lit up at night. It is being funded by a £475,000 grant from the Government’s Working Neighbourhoods Fund as well as money from Waltham Forest Council. A spokesman for Newham Council, which . is responsible for Stratford, said: 'Nowhere else in London is changing . at the scale and pace of Stratford. 'Over the next 15 years it will become a new metropolitan centre supporting many thousands of jobs. 'Alongside . the development of the Olympic Park and Europe's largest urban shopping . centre at Westfield Stratford City, bold regeneration plans are set to . create a competitive alternative to other London business districts such . as Canary Wharf and Kings Cross. 'Stratford . is already a major transport node with fast rail, tube and DLR . connections to the City, West End and Canary Wharf and new transport . projects will provide further improved access to central London, the . rest of the UK and Europe. 'As . the greatest show on earth comes to London in 2012, the legacy of this . year's Olympic and Paralympic Games is set to position Stratford as a . world-leading residential, business, leisure and tourism destination. New: The athletes' village in the Olympic Park gives a very different impression of Stratford to the photographs of tatty buildings . Impressive: The Olympic village is believed to have cost £1.1bn to develop . Makeover: The shops and restaurants on Leyton High Road have had their brickwork painted in preparation for the Olympics . A lick of paint: Improvement work was carried out on Leyton High Road in time for the Olympics . 'Already firmly established as a destination in its own right - 13.6 million people visited Westfield Stratford City during its first 14 weeks after opening in September 2011 - the immediate future will see the area continue to flourish with developments such as the Lend Lease and London and Continental Railways (LCR) £1.3 billion commercial district The International Quarter (TIQ), as well as the transformation of the Queen Elizabeth Park after the 2012 Games. 'The council operates a free disposal service for bulky waste. There is no excuse for residents dumping matresses and we will not tolerate this.' Ilan Goldman, of Catalyst Capital, asset managers on behalf of Stratford Centre owners CEPF Chariot Sarl, said: 'The Stratford Centre is thriving, far from being overshadowed by our neighbour, we have seen our footfall increase significantly since Westfield opened in 2011 and expect 24 million people to visit us this year. 'Ahead of the Olympic Games, we have invested hundreds of thousands of pounds in a new entrance and frontage, improved the shopping areas and signage and are working with retailers to jointly make improvements to individual shops and storefronts. 'We are also working to bring forward exciting development plans for the Stratford Centre and Morgan House, which will enhance both buildings and further contribute to Stratford’s resurgence.'","Almost £9.3bn has been spent on the Games, with 75 per cent earmarked for regeneration projects .

"By . Steve Robson . Blunders: Professor Philip Lamey is accused of misdiagnosing 33 patients at Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast . A professor of dentistry misdiagnosed patients who had cancer - prescribing one with sugar-free chewing gum when she had a tumour in her jaw and another with iron supplements for skin cancer - a tribunal has heard. Philip Lamey allegedly misdiagnosed seven people with mouth cancer - four of whom later died - at the School of Dentistry in Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast. In total 135 patients were recalled after doubts were raised about their biopsy results, a hearing of the General Dental Council (GDC) in London was told today. Professor Lamey, who is being represented by lawyers at the hearing, faces 46 charges after concerns were raised about his diagnosis of 33 patients. David Bradly, counsel for the GDC, said on one occasion the dentist's blunders caused a patient to be rushed to hospital after a wrong diagnosis. The patient was told she had temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) - chronic jaw pain - when she in fact had a tumour in her jawbone. Mr Bradly said: 'Professor Lamey gave a . diagnosis of TMD and prescribed sugar-free chewing gum for treatment . and said he would see her in three months. 'She actually had a tumour in the . mandible and was admitted to hospital. She had a squamous cell carcinoma - a type of skin cancer - and had . radiotherapy following an operation.' On another occasion he diagnosed an . elderly patient as having a traumatic ulceration of the . tongue. He repeatedly prescribed iron . supplements to the 78-year-old, but eventually again made a late diagnosis of . squamous cell carcinoma. Mr Brady added: 'Professor Lamey failed to review the diagnosis of trauma.' He also wrote in his notes that the patient declined a biopsy, when no biopsy was even offered to the pensioner. In total 135 patients at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast had to be recalled after doubts were raised about their diagnosis by Professor Philip Lamey .

"By . Chris Parsons . Olympic bosses have promised to investigate major sponsors after banks of empty seats were spotted at several sold-out Games venues today. Several high-profile venues, including the Aquatics Centre in the Olympic Park and the gymnastics arena in North Greenwich, had rows of empty seats during morning sessions on the first day of the Games. Locog said they would be investigating why the seats were unfilled, while Lord Coe has reportedly promised to name and shame sponsors who did not find takers for the venues. Unfilled: Although cheaper seats higher up in the Aquatics Centre were filled to capacity by the general public, those lower down had rows of empty seats for this morning's swimming heats . Locog said the seats were meant to be filled by officials and media at the Aquatics Centre . Fans who paid huge sums to secure sought-after Olympics tickets were left fuming as seats - thought to have been bought in bulk by Games sponsors - were left unfilled. At the Aquatics Centre, where every session is a sell-out, there were rows of empty seats in the lower tier, where more expensive tickets are situated. London 2012 communications director Jackie Brock-Doyle said: 'The public have turned up, it looks like they were accredited seating [for officials or media]. 'We are looking into who should have been sitting there and why they were not.' Conservative MP Louise Mensch posted a picture of a near empty Aquatic Centre on her Twitter page today, provoking an angry response from some of her followers.

Barren: Empty seats are seen during the Artistic Gymnastics team qualification at the North Greenwich Arena . The ticketing situation will have caused . a further headache for Lord Coe, who admitted before the Opening . Ceremony prices were under review amid fears some venues could remain . partly empty. The London 2012 chairman said that although two million more Olympic tickets have been sold in recent months, the prices of more expensive seats could be cut. Lord Coe said: 'We'll look at all those sorts of things but we've got any number of options. 'I just don’t think, from what’s happening at the moment, we’re going to have a great deal left. 'It was always my ambition to put people that look like they wanted to be in the stadium, to make them affordably priced... and really to meet our revenue targets (£600million) and I think we’ve done that in a really, really difficult climate.' Great Britain's women's football clash with New Zealand was played out before empty stands at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff . Olympic organisers have struggled to sell tickets to women's football with games including North Korea's match against Colombia in Hampden Park, Glasgow played in front of thousands of empty seats . Meanwhile, there were reports of queues of up to 50 minutes for free water inside the rowing venue at Eton Dorney. Spectator Anna Woodhams said: 'There was an excellent atmosphere. The people doing the catering weren't coping very well, but it's day one and it was ok. I'm sure they'll learn from it.' LOCOG promised to reduce the queues. A spokeswoman said: 'There are five free water points within the venue and also 19 concessions selling water. 'Yes, there were queues and we're working hard to keep them to a minimum.' By Saturday night it emerged that more tickets had gone on sale via the official Games website, suggesting they may be being witheld from sponsors and given to fans. But the website was unable to cope with the new flood of demand and by 10.50pm had crashed under the volume of demand.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A cheerful 18-year-old waitress at a Nebraska Cracker Barrel has even more to smile about after a couple of customers left her a $6,000 tip. During their meal the two men questioned Abigail Sailors, who has spent nearly her entire life in foster care, as to why she was so happy. What the 18-year-old told them moved the anonymous tippers so much that one immediately got out his check book. Lots to smile about: Waitress Abigail Sailors can return to college thanks to the generosity of two Cracker Barrel customers . The $6,000 tip means Abigail, who was working to raise funds for college, can return to her studies in North Dakota . 'I couldn't believe it. I tried to thank them, and they said, ""Thank God"",' she said. When the customers first came into the Cracker Barrel they had asked to be seated with the grumpiest waitress but, after being told all the staff were happy, they were put with the most cheerful - Abigail. As they questioned the 18-year-old, she revealed a tragic life where she lived with an abusive stepfather after her mother was seriously injured in a car accident. Abigail was seven months old when her parents crashed on a country road, leaving her mother brain damaged, Gawker reported. After her father was declared unfit to care for Abigail and her four brothers and sisters, the children were moved to a foster home. Windfall: Two customers at this Nebraska Cracker Barrel left a large tip for waitress Abigail . Positive outlook: Despite a difficult past Abigail is optimistic about her future and grateful to her current foster parents for finally offering her stability . 'All the horror stories you hear about . foster care, we lived through it,' Abigail's sister, Sydnie, told the Lincoln Journal Star. Their foster father was eventually jailed for abuse, and the siblings were sent to live in separate homes. Abigail, Sydnie and one of their brothers were moved back with their biological father, but he too was arrested for abuse. The siblings didn't experience any love or stability until John and Susi Sailors took them in nine years ago. 'I don't know how I would have turned out if I didn't have them. They shaped the person I am today,' Abigail, who has adopted the couple's family name, said. As well as telling her customers about her difficult upbringing, Abigail told them of her plans for the future, and how she had just completed her first semester at Trinity Bible College in North Dakota. Despite not having the funds immediately available to be able to return for the next semester, she told the men she couldn't wait to continue her studies in youth ministry and psychology. It was at that point that one of the customers, who had attended the same college, wrote out a check to pay $5,000 in tuition fees and $1,000 in school supplies. Back to school: The tip means Abigail can return to Trinity Bible College in North Dakota . The men also left a $100 tip which Abigail shared with another waitress. 'I said, ""Are you serious"", and my eyes just filled with tears. It's always been my dream college to go there and play basketball, and go to a Christian school where I can seek God,' she told Fox News. Her foster father was also full of praise for Abigail, saying: 'She’s always been a good worker and paid her own bills and saved her money. He added: 'She’s a great girl. It’s amazing where she is from, what she’s been through.'","Abigail Sailors and her siblings were placed with abusive foster family after mother suffered brain damage .

"By . Sam Webb . The son of an Indian politician killed in an air crash in 1973 is one of the 227 passengers feared dead after the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines flight. The family of Canadian-Indian Muktesh Mukherjee, 42, fear he has shared the same fate as his grandfather Mohan Kumaramangalam, Indira Gandhi’s steel and mines minister who died on Indian Airlines flight 440 which crashed close to New Delhi four decades ago, killing 48 of the 65 passengers on board. Mr Mukherjee, the vice-president of operations in China for the Pennsylvania-based XCoal Energy and Resources, was one of five Indians on the flight. Muktesh Mukherjee, 42, and his wife Xiaomao Bai, 37, were on the missing Malaysia Airlines . His 37 year old Chinese wife Xiaomao Bai was also on the flight. 'We’re living in fear of a second disaster in the air in our family,' a member of his family told India's The Telegraph. Mr Mukherjee's mother Uma, the daughter of Mohan Kumaramangalam’s left her home in Dubai for Beijing yesterday after hearing about the Malaysia Airlines flight. 'We are trying to gather information and get the family together. It’s a very sad time for us,” said Mr Mukherjee's cousin Mangaljit Mukherjee, a Supreme Court lawyer. Mr Mukherjee, the vice-president of operations in China for the Pennsylvania-based XCoal Energy and Resources, was one of five Indians on the flight . Indian Foreign Office spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said: 'Our high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur has personally spoken to the families of all the five Indian nationals on the flight.' Canadian embassy officials confirmed that Ottawa was in touch with the families. Authorities have still found no trace of the missing plane despite searches by ships from six navies and dozens of military aircraft. The massive search is mainly in a 50-nautical mile radius from where the last contact with the plane was made, midway between Malaysia's east coast and the southern tip of Vietnam. Chinese students stand by candles while praying for the passengers aboard the missing Boeing 777 at a school in Zhuji city. The disappearance may be down to a terrorist act .

Malaysia's civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman described the disappearance of the plane as an 'unprecedented aviation mystery'. He said a hijacking could not be ruled out as investigators explore all theories for the loss of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. 'Unfortunately we have not found anything that appears to be objects from the aircraft, let alone the aircraft,' he told a news conference. 'As far as we are concerned, we have to find the aircraft, we have to find a piece of the aircraft if possible.'

"By . Ashley Collman . The morning queue for cronuts may be a lot shorter after a mouse was recorded scampering around Dominique Ansel Bakery on Thursday. The downtown Manhattan bakery became famous last year when owner and pastry chef Dominique Ansel invented the cronut - a croissant/doughnut hybrid that has inspired epic hour-long waits in the morning. But on Thursday a YouTube user took video of a mouse scampering around what appears to be the bakery's floor, which could cause the health department to close the facility. Scroll down for video . Everyone loves Cronuts - even mice! Video taken by a customer shows a mouse scampering around the floor at Dominique Ansel Bakery - home to the ever-popular Cronut . Shocking truth: The YouTube user made sure to tilt his camera up to prove he was inside the legendary bakery - as evidenced the signage above . Bold mouse: The YouTube use who took the video says he saw the mouse scamper around for a good 20 seconds before taking out his camera phone . Claim to fame: Dominique Ansel Bakery is world famous for inventing the Cronut - a croissant/donut hybrid that still inspires hour-long waits even a year after it hit the shelves . YouTube user Cody Pickrodt shot the video at Dominique Ansel, and spoke with Gothamist about the troubling sighting. 'I . pointed it out to a couple waiting in line behind me. They didn't . believe it until I showed them the video. Then they had to leave,' Pickrodt said. 'I didn't mention it to employees. It appeared they were all aware of it. 'This . was the tail end of the little guy's adventure. He ran all over the . place in plain view for a good 20 seconds before I got my phone out. Maybe Dominique needs a cat? Like bakeries did in the old days,' he suggested. An . employee who answered the phone at Dominique Ansel Thursday evening . referred all comments to their PR representative, who later emailed a statement saying the famed bakery has done a deep clean. 'Following up on hearing the news, our staff spent 7 hours in a deep clean session,' the rep told MailOnline. 'We did not find anything at all and suspect it may been one solitary mouse that came in from the outside as we have a garden in the back and open the doors during the warmer days. 'Cleanliness is of utmost importance to us and in the 3 years that we've been opened, we've received nothing short of an A for our health inspections.'

"By . Louise Eccles . and Daily Mail Reporter . Dream holiday: Keen sailors Roger and Margaret Pratt . A diving instructor who saw yacht attack couple Roger and Margaret Pratt days before they were attacked by armed robbers said the couple had been ‘like newlyweds’ and ‘so in love’. It comes as a photo emerged of the couple about to set off on their fateful round-the-world trip, from which one of them would not return. Three men were still being questioned . last night over the death of Mr Pratt, 62, as he defended his wife on board their . yacht in a Caribbean harbour. Roger . Pratt, 62, was left floating face down in the water after a gang of . armed robbers attacked him and his wife Margaret, 60 who had been . brutally attacked but survived. A scuba diving instructor, who took . the couple out on a trip just two days before their death, said he was . struck by how in love the couple were. Nathaniol Chester accompanied them last Tuesday and Wednesday on two two-hour dives off the coast of Soufriere. He said: ‘They were both smiling at each other all day. ‘They . looked so much like newlyweds, or a couple who had just met and yet . they were like twins. They finished each other’s sentences. ‘Roger . was very caring towards his wife. He told me straight away that she was . nervous about diving and said ""I want to get her confidence up"". ‘He told me to ‘take good care of her’. I told him not to worry and I would look after her. ‘He went diving by himself while me and Margaret dived in the shallow waters. ‘When . she was more confident, I brought Roger back and they held hands and . went diving together. It was wonderful, actually, looking at them. ‘I went home the night I first met them and told my wife about them and how they were getting old together and still so in love. ‘They . were having a ball and were hoping to dive all over the Caribbean and . were about to go to Trinidad to get their visa for the northern . islands.’ Fateful: Mr and Mrs Pratt's family released this photo of them chatting to a friend ahead of their trip . Carefree: But Mr Pratt, 62, would not return from the trip, which had begun for the couple last summer . Crime scene: The Pratts' beloved £200,000 yacht, Magnetic Attraction . A photograph taken from a blog post by Roger Pratt who was murdered while on his dream Caribbean yachting holiday . Mr Chester said . he was ‘pained’ when he heard on the radio the three days later that Mr . Pratt had been found dead face down in the water next to his boat. As soon as I heard them say the boat’s name, it fell into place and I said ‘No, no, no, how can this be? ‘I am so shocked and angry this has happened.’ Roger Pratt, 62, was left floating face down in the water after a gang of armed robbers attacked him . The . retired financial consultants were halfway through a dream six-month . sailing trip when they moored moored in . Fort Vieux, an industrial town in St Lucia. Relatives . said Mrs Pratt, of Warwickshire, had been ‘badly beaten up’ but was . being ‘very strong’ in order to help the police with their . investigation. A . post-mortem of Mr Pratt’s body began yesterday at the mortuary at . Victoria Hospital, on the outskirts of St Lucia’s capital, Castries. The three men were said to be from a poor shanty town area of St Lucia. A . police spokesman said: ‘When we have the results of the post-mortem we . will know better if we can make any arrests or charge anyone for his . death. ‘Mrs Pratt is now in the care of the Foreign Office. She has been through a lot and is very fragile at the moment.’ On Sunday afternoon, Mrs Pratt was taken back to the boat on which her husband was murdered to collect her belongings. Days . before the killing, Mrs Pratt had written a blog about how blissfully . happy she was as they celebrated her 60th birthday on the island, . writing ‘60 not out! Altogether a delightful and memorable day. Happiness is…’. Yesterday, . she was staying in a hotel, while forensic tests are carried out on the . couple’s beloved yacht, Magnetic Attraction, at a police marine unit. In a travel blog, Mrs Pratt spoke of her frustration that they had been kept in the industrial port of Vieux Fort – which she called a ‘one-horse town’ – after being denied clearance to leave by customs officials. Mr Chester said: ‘Vieux Fort is an empty place with no tourists and does not have good security. They would have been more of a target there then further north in St Lucia.’ Yesterday, Mrs Pratt’s sister Jenny Riley said she was a ‘very strong person’ who was coping well with her ordeal. The house in Moreton Paddox near Stratford-on-Avon where Roger and Margaret Pratt lived . She said: ‘She has been back on the boat but she is staying in a hotel and is eing well looked after.‘Margaret is a very strong person. ‘She was badly beaten up, but she is not in a critical condition. She is out of hospital and is well.’There are more than 50 murders a year in St Lucia and thousands of violent crimes, despite a population of jst 174,000. A British expat living near the capital city of Castries, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Tourism is the main industry here so the violence is hushed up but there is a massive crime wave happening here which goes unreported. ‘The population is impoverished, a quarter are unemployed and there are lots of drugs gangs.‘In Castries, it is extremely dangerous to go out at night and it’s not a good idea to go anywhere off the beaten track in St Lucia.’ The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice warn tourists about the violent side of the holiday island on its website. It states: ‘Incidents of violent crime, including murder tend to occur within the local community but can sometimes affect tourists. ‘The St Lucian authorities work with the tourism industry to maintain a safe environment for visitors. ‘Nevertheless, muggings and thefts from hotels, yachts or holiday homes do occur, and are occasionally accompanied by violence, and there have been a number of serious assaults involving tourists and residents in recent years.’","Roger Pratt, 62, was left floating face down in the water by armed robbers .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Snakes are sneaky creatures that can be found almost anywhere. From the freezing Arctic to the planet’s arid deserts, these animals are talented travellers. Now space scientists are planning to use this talent to explore a much tougher location- the hostile surface of Mars. A team from the SINTEF research . institute in Trondheim, Norway, is studying how snake robots could be . used to gather samples from hard-to-reach places on the red planet. Scroll down for video... A team from the SINTEF research institute in Trondheim, Norway, is studying how snake robots could be used to gather samples from hard-to-reach places on the red planet . The work is part of a feasibility study by the European Space Agency (ESA) which aims to provide greater mobility during space research than traditional rovers can provide. One idea is to use a conventional rover, such as Curiosity, to carry the robot snake over large distances and then deploy it to places the rover can’t access. So far, NASA has landed four rovers on Mars. These are solar-powered robots with six wheels and robotic arms that can take soil samples and operate cameras. Sojourner landed in 1997, Spirit and Opportunity in 2003, while the more advanced Curiosity was landed last summer. One idea put forward by the SINTEF researchers (pictured) is to use a conventional rover, such as Curiosity, to carry the robot snake over large distances and then deploy it to places the rover can¿t access . ‘Manoeuvrability is a challenge. The Spirit rover was lost after it became stuck in the sand on Mars,’ said Pål Liljebäck and Aksel Transeth at SINTEF ICT. ‘The vehicles just cannot get to many of the places from which samples have to be taken.’ At the moment, soil samples from Mars are analysed on board the rover itself, and the results are sent back to Earth. But this takes time. Even moving at light speed, results from Mars take about 20 minutes to reach the surface of Earth. ESA also wants to explore options that could allow samples to be returned to Earth for more detailed analysis, which an extra terrestrial snake robot may help achieve. The group have already developed Wheeko, an experimental snake robot, to study snake robot motion across flat surfaces. The robot consists of 10 identical joint modules, each having two motorised degrees of freedom. The modules are covered by passive wheels to give the robot ground friction, which enables it to slither forward over flat surfaces. ‘We are looking at several alternatives to enable a rover and a robot to work together,’ said Mr Transeth. ‘Since the rover has a powerful energy source, it can provide the snake robot with power through a cable extending between the rover and the robot. ‘If the robot had to use its own batteries, it would run out of power and we would lose it.’ ‘One option is to make the robot into one of the vehicle's arms, with the ability to disconnect and reconnect itself, so that it can be lowered to the ground, where it can crawl about independently.' The researchers envisage a cable . connecting the robot to the vehicle to supply power and communication . signals and also help winch it back in. The researchers envisage a cable connecting the robot to the vehicle to supply power and communication signals and also help winch back the snake into the rover . ‘The connection between the robot and the rover also means that the snake robot will be able to assist the vehicle if the latter gets stuck’, said Mr Liljebäck. ‘In such a situation, the robot could lower itself to the ground and coil itself around a rock enabling the rover to pull itself loose by means of the cable winch, which the rover would normally use to pull the snake robot towards the rover.’ Another option would be for the robot to be located underneath or on top of the rover. This would require a hoisting mechanism to pick up the robot, lift it up and connect it to the rover. The researchers, who are working with CIRiS (Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Space) and NSC (the Norwegian Space Centre), plan to publish a detailed report on the extra-terrestrial snake robot in December.","The work is part of a study by ESA to overcome rovers' current limitations .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he has given the country's security forces the permission to use 'all measures' to find three teenagers who authorities say were kidnapped in a Jewish settlement on the West Bank. The three teens have not been seen or heard from since Thursday evening or Friday morning, and an Islamic extremist group called Dawlat al-Islam has reportedly taken credit for the abductions. '(They were) kidnapped by a terror organization, there is no doubt about that,' Netanyahu said in a nationally televised address Saturday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Demands: Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu says it is the responsibility of the Palestinian government to find three Israeli teens kidnapped by terror group . Netanyahu went on to say that 'it is the responsibility' of the Palestinian Authority to help find the young men. The prime minister says that he has asked Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 'to do everything to help bring them back in peace.' The organization, linked to ISIS, distributed pamphlets about the kidnappings in Hebron, Haaretz reported. Israel security services are investigating the claims. ISIS are the group of bloody-thirsty jihadists behind this week's Iraq insurgency. Israeli soldiers searched the West Bank on Friday for the missing teenagers, who are also feared kidnapped by Palestinian militants. Men pose with automatic rifles and a stationary machine gun, with the ISIS flag propped up behind them. An extremist group linked to the jihadists has claimed responsibility for the alleged kidnappings of three teens in Israel . Israeli soldiers deploy near the West Bank city of Hebron on Friday. Israeli soldiers searched the West Bank on Friday for three missing teenagers from nearby settlements, one of them a U.S. citizen, amid fears Palestinian militants abducted them, authorities said . Authorities . offered little detail, with local media only reporting the hitchhiking . teenagers left their Yeshiva, or religious seminary, on Thursday night . and had not been seen since. Soldiers near Hebron combed the rocky hills . of the West Bank searching for them on Friday. The disappearances come after the formation of a Palestinian unity government following . the collapse of U.S.-brokered peace talks. Two Israeli defense officials said authorities believed the teens likely were kidnapped by Palestinian militants, without elaborating. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to brief journalists. 'The main mission is to ensure their return,' said Brig. Gen. Motti Almoz, a military spokesman. Tsuri Tsuf, a spokesman for a settlement where one of the teens is from, told Israel's Channel 10 television that his community was 'greatly worried' and gathered to pray for the safety of the youths. Authorities found a burned-out car during their search that investigators were examining. Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency initially imposed a gag order on Friday morning blocking local media from reporting on the incident. Later, an official familiar with the investigation said that one of the teens was an American and that Israeli authorities notified U.S. Ambassador Dan Shapiro. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to publicly brief journalists. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the U.S. Department of State. The three teens are from settlements in the West Bank, territory Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and that Palestinians are demanding as part of their future state along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. A burnt car which is reportedly connected to the disappearance of three teenagers is taken away near the West Bank city of Hebron on Friday . If Palestinians abducted the teens, it would be the first serious incident to challenge relations with Israel since the formation of a Palestinian unity government earlier this month, led by President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party and backed by the Islamic militant group Hamas. The West and Israel consider Hamas a terror group because of its deadly attacks targeting civilians. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Abbas to talk about the missing teenagers and likely will call Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu as well, a senior State Department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. Netanyahu told the teens' families that Israel is 'making every effort' to find them, his office said in a statement. He earlier said the Palestinian Authority is responsible for the teens' safety. Adnan Demeiri, spokesman of the Palestinian security services, dismissed Netanyahu's claims, saying the teens' disappearance happened in an area under Israeli security protection. Hamas frequently calls for the abduction of Israelis and militants have kidnapped Israelis in the past. The Israeli military has said it has foiled multiple Palestinian kidnapping attempts in recent years and warns soldiers and civilians not to accept rides from strangers. Despite the warnings, hitchhiking remains common in Israel.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Whatever will they say on Strictly Come Dancing? Ballroom dancing fans are in a whirl over a proposal which could prevent same sex dance partners from competing against mixed sex couples. The British Dance Council (BDC) is considering a rule change which would define a dance partnership as being 'one man and one lady...unless otherwise stated'. Scroll down for video . Ruled out?: Gili Shem Tov and Dorit Milman dance together on the Israeli version of Strictly Come Dancing . Critics have claimed the proposal could see same-sex dancer partners banned from ballroom competitions because organisers or competitors are not 'comfortable' with their participation. But BDC president Bryan Allen insisted the proposal followed complaints that mixed sex dance partners were 'unfairly disadvantaged' in competitions against all-male couples. Mr Allen said: 'There had been complaints from a number of people who felt they were unfairly disadvantaged by the participation of all male dance couples who are physically stronger. 'We're looking to regulate the situation as there is nothing in the rules at the moment. 'There is no proposal to stop same sex couples dancing. We don't discriminate on colour, race, sexuality or anything else. 'My gut feeling is it would probably help to strengthen same sex competitions. I wish we had more of them.' The proposal, which will be considered at the BDC's change of rules meeting on July 21, reads: 'This council recognises a partnership to be one man and one lady in all adult amateur and professional competitions and championships unless otherwise stated.' Ballroom dancing organisers are worried that all male couples could have an advantage over mixed sex couples (pictured, Suzanna Reid and Kevin Clifton compete in last year's competition) Heather Devine, who competes with her female dance partner Chrisi Lyons, said: 'I am really distressed that the BDC is even considering banning us. 'We've put in a huge amount of effort. To exclude us will mean that we can't dance in mainstream competitions any more. This seems so unfair.' Ms Devine, who is European same-sex senior women's ballroom champion with her partner Ms Lyons, has written to Mr Allen to voice her concerns. She added: 'Contrary to claims by some supporters of the new rule, male same-sex dance duos do not have an advantage. 'Ballroom dancing is not like tennis or football. Power and strength are not the key to winning. 'Poise, musicality, expression. timing, floorcraft and presentation are the main judging criteria. This means that two men do not have an advantage over a mixed-sex couple.' Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: 'We are concerned this proposed ban may be motivated by some judges, competitors and spectators not being comfortable with the participation of same-sex dance partners.' It is understood the BDC rules committee will meet on July 20 to decide whether or not to put forward the proposals to the governing body's board of directors. If the proposal goes ahead, the board of directors meet on July 21 to decide whether or not to adopt the rule change.","British Dance Council considering changing definition of partnership .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This is the moment an unarmed Connecticut woman rammed a White House barricade before being shot dead by police last fall. The startling images were released today by the U.S. Attorney's Office as the officers who fatally shot Miriam Carey after a high-speed car chase from the White House to the Capitol learned they will not face criminal charges.

Her child was in the back seat of the car but was unharmed. The U.S. Attorney's Office released a timeline Thursday providing the most detailed account to date of Carey's interaction with law enforcement. Authorities said the incident began when the former dental hygienist drove into a well-marked White House checkpoint, ignored orders to stop and then struck a bike rack and an officer in her path.

That officer and another officer from the Secret Service fired nine rounds each and Carey's car crashed into a kiosk and came to a rest. She was unconscious at the time and did not get out of the car, according to the account from prosecutors. Carey suffered five gunshot wounds to her neck and torso, one of which was fatal, and was pronounced dead at a hospital, the authorities said. Carey had been diagnosed with postpartum depression and psychosis. In the months before the Washington incident, she told police officers at her Connecticut apartment that President Barack Obama had communicated with her and had set up cameras to record her life for national news outlets, police said. It is not clear why she came to Washington that day. She was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time, police have said.

'Accident, mistake, fear, negligence and bad judgment do not establish such a criminal violation,' the office of U.S. Attorney Ron Machen said in a statement.

"By . Associated Press . A San Diego college student who was locked and handcuffed in a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration cell for five days without food or water says he exchanged words with a man through his cell door just before a light was turned off. Daniel Chong told reporters Thursday that he doesn't remember what was said. But Chong does say he spent at least two days in darkness, at times banging on the cell door. Nobody responded. Scroll down for video . Nightmare: Daniel Chong recounts how he was held in a DEA cell for days in the dark after he was forgotten there . A report released Tuesday faults several DEA officials who should have discovered Chong earlier. Chong pictured on Thursday at a press conferece . The U.S. Justice Department inspector general says four DEA employees saw or heard Chong during his April 2012 incarceration in a summery of the investigation released Tuesday. The Justice Department's inspector general faulted several DEA employees for their handling of the  incident that left Chong in grave physical health, cost the agency a $4.1 million settlement and led to nationwide changes in the agency's detention policies. The employees told investigators they found nothing unusual in their encounters with Chong and assumed whoever put him in the cell would return for him shortly. Chong, then 23, ingested methamphetamine, drank his own urine to survive and cut himself with broken glasses while he was held. The three-page summary of the investigation does not say when the four employees encountered Chong or what they heard or saw, and the DEA wouldn't elaborate. The agency declined to say if any employees faced consequences, calling it an 'ongoing internal disciplinary matter.' Chong was handcuffed behind his back without access to a toilet. He has said he slid a shoelace under the door and screamed for attention before he was found covered in his feces. He said he used a shard from his broken glasses to try to carve a 'Sorry Mom' farewell message on his arm but only managed to finish an 'S.' Payout: The college student who was taken to county jail and subsequently forgotten for five days, settled with the Department of Justice Tuesday for $4.1 million last July . Chong, a student at University of California, San Diego, was detained in a drug sweep and told after brief questioning that he would be released. Last year, he reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the federal government over what his attorneys called a near-death experience. The Justice Department's inspector general found the DEA's San Diego office didn't have a system to track detainee movements, that holding cells were not equipped with cameras and that an employee assigned to monitor cells had many other responsibilities. Employees were not required to sign in or out of the detention area, and there were no reliable electronic entry records because the door lock wasn't working. Left alone: Mr Chong was arrested in April 2012 as part of a drug bust, but was told he was going to be released . There was no DEA policy or training regarding operations of holding cells at the time and no requirement that holding cells be checked at the end of each day. The inspector general faulted three case agents  one a DEA employee and two assigned to an agency task force - and one supervisor who were responsible for Chong's safety. It said the supervisor exercised poor judgment and violated DEA policy by assigning two of the agents to process evidence from the cell after Chong was found. Investigators also faulted DEA management for launching an investigation into Chong's detention before alerting the inspector general, a violation of DEA and Justice Department policies that they said could have hampered any criminal prosecution. The DEA is part of the Justice Department. The DEA said Chong's case prompted new nationwide policies for handling detainees that largely mirror the inspector general's recommendations . The DEA said Chong's case prompted new nationwide policies for handling detainees that largely mirror the inspector general's recommendations. 'The DEA is confident that these measures will help to prevent similar incidents in the future,' the agency said in a statement. Julia Yoo, an attorney for Chong, said she was 'gratified that the investigation seems to be thorough' but called on the inspector general to release the full report. She said Chong was still in school in San Diego and 'doing well.' Chong and his attorneys are calling for the release of the full report.","Daniel Chong says he was left in the cell for five days without food or water in the dark .

"By . Paul Donnelley . The collection of a lifetime of cars and vehicle memorabilia has sold at auction for £3million. Michael Banfield, a founder member of the Historic Commercial Vehicle Society, spent more than 50 years collecting buses, emergency vehicles and cars. His interest was sparked in 1959 when he bought his first classic car, a 1927 Bentley. Michael Banfield with the Merryweather fire engine. The company Merryweather was founded in the 19th Century and is still family owned. The founder was Moses Merryweather (1791-1872) of Clapham, who was joined by his son Richard Moses (1839-1877). Appliances were available in small sizes suitable for a country house, pumping about 100 gallons per minute, through to large dockyard models, that could eject 2,000 gallons per minute. The same 1913 Merryweather fire engine as it appears today. The company that made it still exists and is based in Tuesnoad Grange, a Grade II. listed, 15th Century Elizabethean Yeoman's House at Tuesnoad, Kent. Michael Banfield sitting in the Merryweather appliance receiving a trophy . Over the next 50 years, the collection encompassed dozens of cars and more than 1,200 items of automobilia. Mr Banfield, from Staplehurst, Kent, died last year and his family sold his collection in a special auction with Bonhams. It included a 1914 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost which sold for £418,140 and a trio of buses sold for in excess of £500,000. This included a 1922 AEC S-Type open-top double-deck bus which sold for a world record £281,500 - three times more than expected. A collection of fire engines further heated up the bidding, with a 1913 Merryweather Fire Engine selling for £74,300, and a 1910 Delahaye Fire Engine chassis selling at £13,225, more than doubling its top estimate. The final total was more than £3m and 99.7 per cent of the lots were sold. Malcolm Barber, Bonhams co-chairman and auctioneer at the sale, said: ‘For more than 50 years Michael Banfield dedicated himself to the restoration and preservation of these fantastic vehicles. ‘I’m delighted we were able to celebrate Michael and his collection with the weekend’s event, honouring his life’s passion with his friends, family, and automotive enthusiasts. ‘Bidders came from all over the world including several from the southern hemisphere, with clients from both Australia and New Zealand not only bidding in the room, but also watching via Bonhams online bidding platform. ‘Customers registered from Japan, the Mid-West of America, Miami, across Europe and even Hong Kong - this was a highly sought after collection with many of Bonhams international clients taking an intense interest.’ After founding the Historic Commercial Vehicle Society, Michael Banfield became chairman in 1965, a role he remained in until 1993 when the society became a charity. He then stayed on as CEO until his retirement in 2011. His efforts were rewarded when, in 2007, he was made an Honorary Life President of the VCC and was given a Lifetime achievement award by the Transport Trust. All aboard, plenty of room on top: This is a 1922 AEC S-Type open top double decker bus. This bus was built between 1920 and 1927. This particular vehicle went into service on October 2, 1922 with the Metropolitan Stage Carriage plate No 2635. Among the routes that it plied from Nunhead Lane was No 12, which ran from The Plough at Dulwich to the Princess Victoria at Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's Bush, a journey of 13.3-miles for which the full fare was 8d (3.5p). Its driver would have been paid £4 a week, his conductor £3 15s (£3.75) The AECS Type bus in the late 1960s. When it was auctioned at Bonhams it went for £281,500 .

In 1914 the British Government hired Gaston, Williams & Wigmore to supply American chassis to be fitted with bodies in England. A leading supplier was Peerless of Cleveland, Ohio, a firm that began when Queen Victoria was on the throne and started off making mangles before turning to bicycle manufacture. From 1915 until 1918 the Government bought 12,000 Peerless truck chassis, which were imported via Liverpool. This lorry sold for £42,550.

Like its contemporary Peerless, Pierce-Arrow of Buffalo, New York, who made this lorry, began by manufacturing domestic items. In the case of Pierce-Arrow they made fridges and birdcage. They started making lorries in June 1911 and this R8, which is dated 1917 by the Veteran Car Club, was bought by Michael Banfield in June 1973. This 1929 Chevrolet LQ International 14-seater coach was manufactured at the General Motors factory at Hendon. The bus was the forerunner of the Bedford commercial vehicle range and was powered by a six-cylinder 2.9-litre petrol engine with overhead valves. It has a four-speed gearbox and sold for £40,250 . 1922 Tilling Stevens double deciker bus. The company behind the bus was founded in 1847 by Thomas Tilling and started a horse-drawn omnibus service three years later. By 1897 the company had 4,000 horses. Tilling¿s is thought to have been the first company to run a regular service over a regular route. They bought the first electric buses in 1904 and by 1921 they had a fleet of 150 running in London. Thios bus began its working life in Catford, south London, in June 1922 and Mr Banfield bought this from a scrapyard on February 17 1970. It sold for £216,540. 1906 Minerva Roi Des Belges.  The Minerva was created by Sylvain de Jong who in 1889 began a Belgian company importing English bicycles. He began manufacturing cars in 1902 and the following year founded the Société Anonyme Minerva Motors. This car sold for £177,340 .

He began racing cars and in 1897 finished in seventh place in the 106-mile Paris Dieppe Race in a car with an average speed of 19.6 mph . 1916 Crossley RF Van: On the outbreak of war in August 1914 Crossley of Manchester changed its production line to almost entirely to producing vehicles for military service. By the Armistice, there were more than 6,000 being used and for 25 years Crossley was the preferred supplier to the RAF. This one sold for £52,900 . 1935 Austin Taxi. One of the last vehicular additions to Mr Banfield's collection, he bought this in 2011 from Dr Peter McWilliam of Yorkshire, who had owned it for 20 years. The model was introduced in 1930 and this particular car went into service in March 1935. It was a reliable cab and the last left service in the 1960s, although this one stopped its working life in the previous decade. It sold for £67,580 . Michael Banfield raises a glass to the Fiat country bus. The vehicle was introduced in 1910 with a 2.6-litre engine and a four-speed gearbox. The Italian army used this as its main way of moving troops around during the Italo-Libyan war of 1911-1912. Mr Banfield's vehicle was registered in Hampshire but its body was later replaced by a bus chassis and the Fiat worked in the Reading area as a station bus . Michael Banfield with his Wolseley lorry at Iden Grange. In 1912, buyers who purchased a certain type of lorry were paid an annual subsidy of £110 to keep them in good order, the rationale being that they would be taken into Army service should war arise. This particular lorry was powered by an 8522cc bi-block four-cylinder engine. Michael Banfield bought it in the 1980s and maintained the lorry so that it is still in good working order.

"By . Peter Rugg . At 98-year-old, Mary Phillips spends most of her time in the San Francisco apartment she's lived in for 50 years. But now with the city's real estate market booming along with its tech industry, the building's owners see dollar signs and are trying to evict her. 'I've been very happy here,' she told KRON 4. 'I've always paid my rent, I've never been late.' Phillips is in danger of being booted because the building's owners, Urban Green Investments, are attempting to temporarily shut down the rental property so they can then sell it at a profit. Mary Phillips, 98, is in danger of being kicked in the street by the building owners hoping to flip the property without any current tenants . In recent years the Bay Area real estate market has exploded leading to property owners nearly doubling evictions as they seek to sell and cash in . Such deals are increasingly common in San Francisco under the Ellis Act. The company did not respond to interview requests, though this is the second time this year it's drawn controversy for abusing the controversial law, as reported by NBC Bay Area. Phillips' neighbor, Sarah Brant, told reporters that the company tried to buy tenants out but with one big catch. 'The letter was very clear that they . would offer a buyout to each unit so long as we got everyone, which of . course is our wonderful Miss Phillips, out of the building within three . months,' she said. 'And that is just not possible.' Building sold under the Ellis Act could be reopened with rents as much as four times higher as previous tenants were paying. Though Mary is rarely able to go out in her older years, she says the apartment's view lets her have some contact with the outside world . In 2012 through September there were 104 units evicted in the city under the Ellis Act. This year for the same period the number has nearly doubled to reach 200. Phillips has called San Francisco home in 1937 - the same year the Golden Gate Bridge opened to traffic - but if she's forced out of her apartment she'll be forced to leave the city because rents have gotten so high. 'Feel . free to let Urban Green CEO David McCloskey, who's evicting her, know . what you think, ask him how he sleeps at night and if he'd put his . grandmother on the streets,' read a post on the Vanishingsf Facebook, followed by the company contact information for David@urbangreeninv.com and the office phone number 415-651-4441. Mary's situation, along with that of hundreds of other Bay Area residents, has led to public demonstrations . Protesters also showed up to support Phillips outside Urban Green Investments' offices Wednesday, though the company has yet to respond. And Philips says they'll have to drag her out. 'They’re . going to have to take me out of here feet first,' she said. 'Just . because of your age, don’t let people push you around.'","Mary Phillips is being forced out of her apartment along with the rest of her fellow tenants by building owner Urban Green Investments .

But the building was fully involved by the time firefighters arrived. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said she is 'deeply concerned' by reports from witnesses that no fire alarms sounded. The building did not have a sprinkler system but was not required to because of its, Pitta said. It did have an alarm system, and whether that was working will be part of the investigation. 'It's a tragic day for the city of Lowell,' Mayor Rodney Elliott said. 'The entire city mourns the loss.' The property's owner, Sanjay M.

Keith Ross, 24, from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, houses 28 snakes, 14 lizards, three tarantulas, three beetles, five turtles and a tiger salamander in his living room. Despite admitting there 'is no space for much else' in his home - the forklift driver also has two porcupines living in his back garden.

Mr Ross with three of ten lizards that call his living room home. The Forklift driver from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, started his collection four years ago - but bought his first pet snake when he was 17 .

Luckily, Mr Ross's girlfriend, Darra, is fine with his collection - although she says she 'likes dogs better'. Mr Ross says he would one day like to turn his hobby in to a profession - and work as a breeder full-time. On his unusual collection, he said: 'I like different things. People buy normal things and I buy one step above them. 'I always buy something a wee bit bigger. Other people buy dogs and cats, I buy snakes and lizards.' Mr Ross says he has always liked lizards and snakes - and first bought a rat snake when he was 17. But his collection did not begin to grow until four years ago when he moved into his own flat. At 15 ft long - his biggest snake is a sunfired reticulated python. Mr Ross, who sometimes takes spiders and snakes along to parties to try and cure people's fears of the creatures, also has two porcupines living in his back garden (pictured) Mr Ross with a turtle. The man's girlfriend thankfully doesn't mind his collection - but admits she prefers dogs . The forklift driver with one of his three tarantulas. Mr Ross says he would one day like to work with animals full-time and become an exotic pet breeder . The biggest lizard Mr Ross owns is a white-throated monitor at 4 ft - which has its own harness so the animal lover can take him for walks. Mr Ross hopes to one day be able to work full time with his animals. He has already begun breeding and has so far sold one baby porcupine to a buyer in Portsmouth. He added: 'I’m the only porcupine breeder in Scotland that has them. I’ve had one baby so far and that went to Portsmouth to an educational place. 'They’re really easy to look after. You treat them like a dog - you can train them.' Mr Ross also takes his snakes and tarantulas to parties with the aim of helping people lose their fear of the creatures. Mr Ross poses with a black-throated monitor lizard - which is one of the largest in his 40-strong collection . Mr Ross with more of his snake collection. The man says whenever his mother comes over, she always checks his living room first to see whether he has got another pet . Of his enormous collection, which includes a 15ft Python, Mr Ross says: 'My friends are used to it by now' He said: 'I had a carpet fitter in and he saw all my collection and came back a month later and asked if I could take a couple of snakes to his daughter’s birthday party and I got the idea from there. 'All the kids and adults enjoy it. Every single person who is scared of spiders has held one. 'There are more snakes and lizards than cats and dogs in the UK now. 'There is no reason for fear and that’s what I’m trying to get across, to be honest it’s adults who are worst and hang back, but the kids are right in there.” Mr Ross has found his friends and family have accepted his living room menagerie.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Most new mothers can sympathise with gaining a little weight after childbirth. Claire Simcox, 48, from Hertford, however, put on four stone during each of her two pregnancies. At her heaviest, when she was 27st and a size 32, doctors told Claire that she wouldn’t live to her fifties. Slimmer: Claire Simox, 48 from Hertofrd, pictured here, dropped 15 stone and went from a size 32 to size 12 . A different woman: At her heaviest, left, Claire weighted 27st, but now weights a healthy 12st, right and exercises every day . But the style-conscious mother still cared desperately about her appearance, spending thousands of pounds on designer sunglasses, shoes and handbags. She says: 'I was the most stylish fat person you could ever meet. I was a complete designer-holic. 'I had all the latest designer accessories but a lot of the best clothes were out of bounds to me because I was too big to fit into any of the sizes. ‘I was a stay-at-home mum, stuck in front of daytime TV and eating crisps every day. I'd eat biscuits chips and burgers and most nights I'd order a takeaway. 'I was compensating for my weight by spending more and more on designer gear when I should have been losing weight and getting healthy.' Claire finally went to see her doctor, who ordered her to lost weight immediately. Don't look! Claire, pictured here before she lost 15st, says she compensated for her weight by splurging on designer accessories such as handbags and sunglasses because the clothes would not fit her . Feeling good: Before she dropped an astonishing 15st, doctors told Claire she might not live into her 50s. 'I completely changed my lifestyle,' she says . ‘He told me I really needed to lose weight, that if I carried on as I was I wouldn’t make it to my fifties and was at risk of heart problems and diabetes,’ says Claire. ‘I cried and told him I didn’t want to die, so vowed to turn my life around.’ Claire began on a low-carb diet, swapping bread potatoes and pasta for chicken, eggs and lean meat. Within a week, she had lost a stone. And, after joining the No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk, the weight continued to fall off. 'I'd never done any regular exercise before,' Claire explained. 'I'd never been to the gym, so it was quite a shock to my system working out at the camp each day. 'I was inspired by the other women around me - they all became great mates as we all lost weight together. 'I completely changed my whole lifestyle virtually overnight. No more daytime TV and more confidence daily.' Claire, pictured after weight loss above, says: 'Now I love being noticed and rarely go out without killer heels and skintight clothes' Claire also started visiting No 1 BootCamp's Ibiza retreat. Over the next few years she lost a staggering 15st - going down from 27st to her current weight of 12st. As part of her dramatic makeover, Claire also dyed her hair from blonde to black. ‘I would bump into old friends in the street and they wouldn't have a clue who they were talking to because my appearance had changed so much,’ she says. ‘I was thrilled that I had changed so much. It really hammered home just how out of shape I had become. 'Now I love being noticed and rarely go out without killer heels and skintight clothes. 'I know how hard it is to transform your life but I want people to realise that it's never too late. 'I'm fit, single and the happiest I've ever been.' Claire is training to be a life coach and a motivation speaker at No 1 Boot Camp so she can help other women to lose weight as she did.","Claire Simcox 48, from Hertford, put on eight stone during two pregnancies .

"By . Andrew Levy . They already had a strained relationship with their  ‘vulnerable’ daughter. And the elderly couple’s troubles mounted after she apparently arrived in a taxi and told them she was moving in. Peter and Betty Smith later walked a short distance from their home and stepped in front of a speeding freight train. Witnesses said the driver sounded the horn for up to a minute as he approached them at an unmanned level crossing. Level crossing: The scene where a couple died after being hit by a train in Cherry Willingham, Lincolnshire . Probe: Officers and rail workers at the scene of the incident where British Transport Police are investigating . Yesterday, neighbours in the picturesque Lincolnshire village of Cherry Willingham said the couple’s apparent suicide pact followed problems with their 50-year-old daughter Jane. Geoff Walpole, 70, who lives two doors away, said: ‘I heard that their daughter arrived with her partner recently by taxi and told them she was going to live there.’ He added that there was a ‘big row’ on the day retired postman Mr Smith, 80, died along with his 78-year-old wife. Residents near their daughter’s home in Lincoln, where she lived with boyfriend Tim Evans, described heated exchanges whenever her father visited her. One, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He used to do the garden for her, and look after the house, clean the windows, do the shopping and then she turned on him about that. He always had to sit outside in  the car.’ Another neighbour, Christine Wearing, 72, said: ‘Peter was such a placid man – he was a real gentleman. He was just such a patient man and did everything for his daughter.’ Mr and Mrs Smith are understood to have told their daughter, who used to work as a children’s nurse, that they were going to the shops on the morning they died. A local shop owner said: ‘I spoke to the daughter this morning. She had moved back in recently but I don’t know why. The couple left their bungalow after reportedly telling their daughter they were getting Mr Smith's glasses fixed . Remembered: This morning a floral tribute was placed close to where the tragedy occurred in Lincolnshire . ‘Peter had problems with his glasses. They were hurting his head. So they told their daughter they were catching the bus into town to get them fixed. ‘That’s when they did it. I’ve known them for 50 years.  It’s so sad.’ Mr Smith and his wife, a former hairdresser, walked on to the railway line shortly before midday  on Wednesday. The crossing has a 12ft wide metal gate. Drivers have to ring the main signal box for clearance to open the gates and cross, but pedestrians are able to walk across using a stile. Residents said that the crossing was used regularly and had a good safety record. The freight train, which was travelling from Lincoln city centre to Immingham Dock in Humberside, came to a halt at another level crossing 500 yards away, a short distance from a secondary school where pupils were taking part in their sports day. A card on flowers left at the scene this morning stated: 'A love to last eternity. Together forever. RIP xx' Services between Lincoln and Grimsby were halted for three hours before resuming in  the afternoon. Paramedics from the East Midlands Ambulance Service arrived at the scene but the couple were pronounced dead. The Smith family said in a statement yesterday: ‘We are deeply saddened by our loss.’ British Transport Police said officers were ‘working to establish the full circumstances of the incident, which is currently being treated as non-suspicious’. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has been informed and the Central Lincolnshire Coroner is expected to open inquests in the next few days.","Peter, 80, and Betty Smith, 79, stepped in front of speeding train together .

"By . Harriet Hernando . They're meant to be our brightest and best, but these incredible exam blunders don't earn the country's university swats any marks. They were however rewarded with a place in the Times Higher Education Supplement’s annual hall of shame. The worst offender will be announced next week, but here are a few of the contest's top entries. Some students took the questions literally . If a University of Ulster student is to be believed, 'In the future all cars will be fitted with a Catholic converter.' And it's hard to know whether this student, also from Ulster, was joking or not when they wrote: 'The hole in the ozone layer was caused by a***holes.' One student from Kings College London wrote 'Most books were written on Valium', but they meant vellum . Similarly, an Aston University student got the wrong spelling here, but may have had a point when they answered: 'The coalition government apparently has a toff stance on tax avoidance. Meanwhile a Canterbury Christ Church University student didn't underestimate the 2010 World Cup soothsayer when they wrote: 'Octopuses are intelligent because they have been found to be able to predict the winners of football matches in the World Cup.' The predictions came from Paul the Octopus. Another had good news for vertically challenged people when they wrote: 'Globalisation has led to a growing interconnectedness between small scale people and larger scale cities.' A history student from University of Exeter explained there was more going on in coffee shops in 18th century London that meets the eye, writing: 'Within these coffeehouses, men from all different parts of the world could interfere with each other.' Meanwhile this student couldn't tell their suppository from their repository, writing: '(Google is) one of the two main suppositories of data in the world.' And food was definitely on the mind for this Canterbury Christ Church University student when they declared 'In 1945 Stalin began to build a buffet zone in Eastern Europe.' Here a history student deftly summed up 2,000 years of history by writing: 'Jesus was probably the main factor the American Civil War was fought the way it was. Not only was Jesus super cool he was really smart. He was born in 1923.' Another tried to bring American rapper Tupac into it, stating: 'Christopher Columbus was a famous explorer who went to the 'New World' on the order of the President. He and his trusty crew mates - Maria, Santa Maria and Tupac.' This history student was clearly clueless, but decided to have a stab at the question anyway, stating: 'Spain was a very Catholic country since Christianity had been taken there in the third century BC'. Another claimed people wanted to live near power lines - to get electricity faster. And a City University student said the failure of Northern Rock bank was due to 'laxative enforcement policies', though they may have been referring to all that money that went down the toilet. The winning entry will be announced in next week’s Times Higher Education Supplement. 'In the future all cars will be fitted with a Catholic converter,' said a University of Ulster student. 'The hole in the ozone layer was caused by a***holes', wrote another University of Ulster student who meant 'aerosols'. 'Hitler's role in the Second World War is often overlooked' -  said a University of Herts student. 'The coalition government has a toff stance on tax avoidance', said an Aston University student. 'Octopuses are intelligent because they have been found to be able to predict the winners of football matches during the World Cup', wrote a Canterbury Christ Church University student in reference to Paul the Octopus from the 2010 tournament. 'Globalisation has led to a growing interconnectedness between small scale people and larger scale cities', from a University of Southampton student. 'Within these coffee houses, men from all different parts of the world could interfere with each other' - a University of Exeter student's verdict on 18th century London. '(Google is) one of the two main suppositories of data in the world.' The University of Sheffield candidate got suppository muddled up with repository. 'In 1945 Stalin began to build a buffet zone in Eastern Europe',  said a history student at Canterbury Christ Church University. 'Spain was a very Catholic country since Christianity had been taken there in the third century BC,' reckoned a history student at the University of Liverpool. 'Most books were written on valium', but the King's College student meant vellum. A City University London student said the failure of Northern Rock bank was due to 'laxative enforcement policies'. When asked for the four P's of marketing, a student at Plumpton College said 'Product, Price, Place and Distribution'. Writing about 'laboratory theatre' a student said an actor was 'straining in their role in the lavatory theatre'. A food science student at King's College London suggested instigating a 'genital mixing action'. Trying to explain the phrase 'some people don't look up until they are flat on their backs' a school pupil wrote: 'Some people can't look up because something has happened to their necks. For example, if a person gets kicked in the neck by a kung fu midget.' When asked 'how many siblings do you have?', one pupil said, 'two - they have hair'. Another wrote 'Jesus was probably the main factor the American Civil War was fought the way it was. Not only was Jesus super cool he was really smart. He was born in 1923.' 'Christopher Columbus was a famous explorer who went to the new world on the order of the president. He and his trusty crew mates - Maria, Santa Maria, and Tupac,' declared one pupil, accidentally referring to the American rapper. When asked what is meant by the term hermaphrodite,  one pupil answered 'Lady Gaga.' When questioned why people would want to live near power lines, a pupil stated 'because you get your electricity faster'.","Times Higher Education Supplement cherry-picks top mistakes .

"A seagull has become the surprise star of a horse race - after it was caught in a photo-finish pipping a top jockey to the post for second place.

"By . James Chapman . and Laura Clark . A wave of strike action billed as the biggest co-ordinated walkout in 90 years by public sector unions was yesterday branded a damp squib. Official estimates put overall turnout at less than half a million, well below the number claimed by unions. In the Civil Service, the Cabinet Office said just 18 per cent of staff had taken part – the smallest number ever to join a national strike. The Local Government Association estimated 95 per cent of local council staff to be in work, and fire services in England were operational thanks to contingency planning. There were also no unplanned closures in the courts, and all 717 Jobcentres in the country opened as usual. Scroll down for video . Unrest: Strikers gathered at Trafalgar Square and have walked onto Westminster as they protest against the current Government's policies on pensions and pay . On the march: Public sector workers waving banners and chanting walk through Newcastle today . Front line: Firefighters in London are among the one million people who have stopped work today . Ghoulish: Teachers dressed and moved like the living dead as they claim Michael Gove's education reforms are turning them and their students into zombies . Thousands of teachers have taken industrial action today, leaving many schools in England and Wales shut . Some unions last balloted on strikes years ago, but despite the threat of a legal clampdown if the Tories win the next election, union leaders threatened a fresh wave of strikes in the autumn and next year without any new ballot of members. But the one-day action over pay and pensions was sufficient to close 21 per cent of schools, leaving thousands of parents having to take time off work or arrange emergency childcare. In some areas, almost all schools were affected, while in others – mainly shire counties – the walkout forced barely any closures. Yesterday Downing Street said David Cameron did not believe ‘illegitimate’ walkouts causing disruption across vital public services can ever be justified, signalling that the Tories are examining tough new anti-strike laws. His official spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister’s view is that he doesn’t think it’s right that public services should be disrupted. He doesn’t believe people should face disruption, be it commuters or parents with children.’ Senior Conservatives are understood to be considering restricting the right to strike across professions where interruptions to services can endanger life, health or the ‘normal living conditions’ of the public. Soldiers and policemen, for similar reasons, are already barred from walking out. Such a move – on top of proposals for higher voting thresholds before strike action can be law and an end to ‘never-ending’ mandates for action that union leaders roll on indefinitely – would be highly controversial. Yesterday some London boroughs saw the majority of schools close or partially close, including Barking and Dagenham, with 90 per cent affected, and Tower Hamlets with 87 per cent. In Manchester, 126 out of 177 schools were fully or partly closed, while in Knowsley, Merseyside, 57 out of 60 schools were affected. Museums shut their doors in Edinburgh, Nottingham and Leicester, some libraries were closed, and bin collections were halted in Derby. The Treasury estimated that the disruption cost the economy as much as £250million. Alongside the NUT, members of the Fire Brigades Union, the GMB, the Public and Commercial Services Union, Unison and Unite all took action. Public sector workers in Trafalgar Square, London, as they take part in the one-day walkout as part of bitter disputes over pay, pensions, jobs and spending cuts . Mix: Teachers, firefighters, passport office workers, job centre advisers, courts staff and council workers joined the London march . In the Commons, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, who is in charge of the Government’s response to the strikes, questioned their legitimacy – saying they had been organised with the backing of tiny proportions of overall union memberships. He also pointed out that some of the ballots used to justify action were months or years out of date – with the National Union of Teachers relying on a vote in 2012. Mr Maude said the more often unions went on strike, the ‘stronger the case’ for a change in the law being included in the Conservatives’ general election manifesto next year. Labour, which has received £23.6million in donations from unions involved in yesterday’s strikes, refused to condemn them. Leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Nobody wants to see these strikes because of the disruption that is being caused for parents and others. Strikes are always a sign of failure on all sides but the key now is to prevent further strikes and further disruption happening. The answer is to get round the table and prevent further strikes happening.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Today’s well- supported action shows just how angry public servants are at plans to lock them out of sharing in the recovery until at least 2018. ‘Nearly half a million local government workers are paid less than the living wage – it is time that they shared in the growth that ministers trumpet. But rather than get round the table, ministers are threatening a change in the law that would make legal strikes close to impossible.’ Conservative MP Dominic Raab said the ‘real aim’ of the strikes was ‘to challenge the will of an elected government to deliver its policies – from deficit reduction to schools reform’. He added: ‘There should be a ban on strikes without the backing of a majority of union members. It’s hardly right-wing: the public back this proposal by three to one.’ Counter-claims: The Government said it believed that 500,000 workers walked out today but unions said it was more than a million .

Close bond: Zona Storie from Shawnee, Oklahoma, has opened up about the heartbreak of telling her nine-year-old child, Trevor, he had a rare form of prostate cancer . Doctors at OU Medical Center in Oklahoma discovered Trevor had Stage 3 rhabdomyosarcoma in mid-December after he was admitted with sickness, abdominal pain and difficulty using the bathroom. His parents were advised by a hospital social worker about how best to relay the news. 'Once they told us, we were struggling about how we were going to tell him,' Mrs Storie said. After she and her husband, Shane, told Trevor about his illness doctors reassured the third grader that it was curable and what the next steps would be.

Back at home, she also had to reassure her two teenage children, daughter Baylee,17, and son Zane, 14, that their brother would be OK. 'All they knew was that cancer is bad,' she said. Doctors immediately performed surgery to remove the tumor in Trevor's prostate and insert a urinary catheter. He is currently undergoing 42 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, which has already caused his hair to fall out.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The boss of the events company that organised a bar crawl during which a teenager was filmed performing a sex act on 24 men has said he will not apologise to the woman's family. Paul Smith, from London, head of Carnage Events Magalluf, defended his pub crawls saying that he had no 'moral responsibility' for the British woman's actions - and said she should be spoken to by her parents. Smith held a press conference at one of his bars in Magaluf today - blaming the Northern Irish teenager's actions on her 'upbringing'. Scroll down for video . Paul Smith (right), who runs Carnage Magalluf, defended his pub crawls saying that he had no 'moral responsibility' for the actions of a British woman (left) who performed a sex act on 24 men at one of the events . Crack down: New rules affect bar crawls in Magaluf after controversy surrounding sex act video (file photo) He said of the video, which was posted on YouTube and went viral last week: 'I was disgusted by it. Disgusted by the young lady who was doing it. 'I can't say that my reps encouraged that as that's not what happened. 'She should be spoken to by her parents. It's something to do with her upbringing. Asked whether he felt any responsibility, Smith told 5 News: 'I've no moral responsibility for this – I wasn’t even fully aware of it at the time. 'The . girl involved even bought a ticket for the following night’s Carnage . tour. Carnage didn’t encourage her, so why should I apologise? 'We’re giving memories of Magaluf, that’s all.' Sitting with his lawyer, Mateo Canes, Smith continued: 'It was wrong for it . to have happened – I made a mistake, but I’m only human and I work hard . for what I’ve got. 'So we’ll be taking action so nothing like . this happens again. There’ll be more security… that sort of thing. I . don’t want to lose my licence, so there will definitely be changes. 'And there needs to be more control of Magaluf.' Smith's comments comes as a new law was passed cracking down on bar crawls in the Spanish party town. Party capital: The 18-year-old blonde, from Northern Ireland, was captured on video working her way through holidaymakers at a nightclub in the island's notorious party capital of Magaluf (pictured) New legislation unveiled today limits to 50 the number of holidaymakers permitted on bar crawls in the popular resort of Magaluf. The mayor of Calvia, the region which includes Magaluf and five other resorts popular with Britons, said today he had passed a law 'giving us tighter control over the operation of pub crawl organisers'. Carnage Magalluf was set up two years ago. The entertainment and events company runs boat parties, ‘celebrity’ pool parties (featuring reality TV stars from shows such as The Only Way Is Essex) and bar crawls. The infamous 'Carnage' bar crawls are run three times a week along Punta Ballena - the main strip through Magaluf. On average, there are 200 British youngsters on these bar crawls, including many who have just finished their A-levels. They pay around £25 a head to join the bar crawl — meaning Carnage takes about £5,000 a night, and £15,000 a week. Those taking part are provided with 'Carnage' branded t-shirts which are emblazoned with slogans such as ‘Snog A Passer-by’ and ‘Have A Lapdance’. Carnage Magalluf, which was set up by two brothers from London, is not linked to Carnage UK - the company behind notorious student party nights in Britain. Manuel Onieva also said a police . investigation had started into last week's incident, adding that he . wished to 'express my total rejection and anger at the activities which . were carried out in a video which is currently on the social media . circuit'. He added: 'Companies operating pub crawls in Calvia now have to apply for a licence through the town hall. 'They have to prove their responsibility and show that they have the appropriate civil insurances in place. 'Each pub crawl guide will have to wear a specific jacket so local police can monitor those operating in the region and identify those that have been approved. 'Pub crawl groups can now not exceed more than 50 people and if any operators exceed this legal capacity, they will be fined.' The pub crawl was organised Carnage . Magalluf which describes itself on its website as the 'leader in . Magalluf party entertainment [sic]'. The company advertises a three-event package for £79.99 including 'barcrawl, boat party and jungle sessions'. The . bar crawl is a four-nights-a-week event which includes 'four hours of . unlimited drinking, four hours of unlimited free shots and a free . Carnage vest/T-shirt'. It has been reported that the Magaluf pub crawls have around 200 British youngsters on them, including many who have just finished their A-levels. The Calvia region, which also includes the resort of Palma Nova, is visited by between 1.6 million and 2 million visitors a year, of whom around one million are Britons. British visits to the region are worth an estimated £640m a year to the local economy. British youngsters take part in the 'Carnage Bar Crawl' in the Spanish resort of Magaluf .

Danny Daly (above) is believed to have set up Carnage Events Magalluf with his brother John . Danny Daly and his brother John are believed to be the men behind the controversial Carnage Magalluf company. The brothers, who are both married with young children, are thought to have set up the operation two years ago after moving to Majorca from the East End of London. Despite living in Santa Ponsa, Majorca (about a ten-minute drive from Magaluf) for around 20 years, they decided to set up the events and entertainment company in 2012. As well as Carnage Magalluf, they also have at least two bars in the resort: EastEnders and Magaluf Rocks. Needless to say, both are on the Carnage bar crawl itinerary. They also own a lap-dancing club called Pure, where Danny Daly was spotted emerging recently, plus two of Magaluf’s biggest hotels, the TRH Torrenova and Palmanova, which means the Dalys have more than 3,000 guests a week. By any reckoning, the brothers are among the most powerful figures in Magaluf. The pair are said to make around £15,000 a week from the Carnage bar crawl alone and reportedly spend their winters at holiday homes in the Bahamas. Despite Carnage Magalluf describing itself on its website as the ‘leader in Magaluf party entertainment’, in contrast, the Dalys are men who prefer to stay behind the scenes. They never give interviews and the one and only picture of Danny Daly on Facebook — where he is wearing a branded Carnage t-shirt — has now been taken down. Danny and John Daly’s right-hand man is believed to be Alan Collinson, 28. He is reportedly paid well enough to afford to rent a luxury villa, with a swimming pool, on the outskirts of Magaluf. A tattooed kickboxer from Hartlepool, Collinson was investigated by Spanish police for allegedly attacking four members of a stag do — leaving two with broken jaws — on a Carnage crawl in May.","Carnage Magalluf boss speaks as Majorca passes new legislation .

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers have uncovered a bizarre new type of 'upside down' sea creature they claim could give an insight into life on one of Jupiter's icy moons. The National Science Foundation team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, used a camera-equipped robot to survey the area under Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf. They found a new species of small sea anemones that were burrowed into the ice, their tentacles protruding into frigid water like flowers from a ceiling. Scroll down for video . The new species of sea anemone, Edwardsiella andrillae, living anchored in the ice at the underside of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Researchers say researchers say it could hint at what life on Jupiter's moon is like. Though other sea anemones have been found in Antarctica, the newly discovered species is the first reported to live in ice. The anemones themselves measured less than an inch long in their contracted state--though they get three to four times longer in their relaxed state. Each features 20 to 24 tentacles, an inner ring of eight longer tentacles and an outer ring of 12 to 16 tentacles. They also live upside down, hanging from the ice, compared to other sea anemones that live on or in the seafloor. In addition to the anemones, the scientists saw fish who routinely swam upside down, the ice shelf serving as the floor of their submarine world, as well as polychaete worms, amphipods and a bizarre little creature they dubbed 'the eggroll', a four-inch-long, one-inch-diameter, neutrally-buoyant cylinder, that seemed to swim using appendages at both ends of its body, which was observed bumping along the field of sea anemones under the ice and hanging on to them at times. 'The pictures blew my mind, it was really an amazing find,' said Marymegan Daly, a specialist in sea anemones at Ohio State University, who studied the specimens retrieved by scientists and engineers with the NSF-funded Antarctic Geological Drilling (ANDRILL) Program's Coulman High project. The team made the astonishing discovery of thousands upon thousands of the small anemones. NASA is helping to finance the development of the new underwater robot because the Antarctic discoveries have implications for the possibility of life that may exist on Europa, the ice-covered moon of Jupiter. The new species, discovered in late December 2010, was publicly identified for the first time in an article published last month in PLOS ONE, an open-access, peer-reviewed journal published by the Public Library of Science. Though other sea anemones have been found in Antarctica, the newly discovered species is the first reported to live in ice. They also live upside down, hanging from the ice, compared to other sea anemones that live on or in the seafloor. The white anemones have been named Edwardsiella andrillae, in honor of the ANDRILL Program. The remotely operated vehicle, known as SCINI (Submersible Capable of under Ice Navigation and Imaging), that made the discovery of the new sea anemone species. Scott Borg, who heads the Antarctic Sciences Section in NSF's Division of Polar Programs, noted that the discovery indicates how much remains both unknown and unexplored by scientists, even after more than 50 years of active U.S. research on the Southernmost continent . 'It is an absolutely astonishing discovery--and just how the sea anemones create and maintain burrows in the bottom of the ice shelf, while that surface is actively melting, remains an intriguing mystery,"" he said. 'This goes to show how much more we have to learn about the Antarctic and how life there has adapted.' NSF is responsible for managing all scientific research and logistics of the U. S. Antarctic Program on the Antarctic continent and in the Southern ocean. The discovery was 'total serendipity,' said Frank Rack, executive director of the ANDRILL Science Management Office at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 'When we looked up at the bottom of the ice shelf, there they were.' Scientists had lowered the robot--a 4.5-foot cylinder equipped with two cameras, a side-mounted lateral camera and a forward-looking camera with a fish-eye lens--into a hole bored through the 270-meter-thick shelf of ice that extends over 600 miles northward from the grounding zone of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet into the Ross Sea. 'People were literally jumping up and down with excitement,' Rack said. 'They had found a whole new ecosystem that no one had ever seen before. 'What started out as an engineering test of the remotely operated vehicle during its first deployment through a thick ice shelf turned into a significant and exciting biological discovery,' he said. This is an artist's concept of a plume of water vapor thought to be ejected off the frigid, icy surface of the Jovian moon Europa, located about 500 million miles (800 million kilometers) from the sun. Plumes of water vapour 100 miles high may have been spotted bursting out of the icy surface of Jupiter's moon Europa, raising hopes it may harbour life. Scientists believe they detected two vapour jets shooting into space for seven hours at a time. Europa's vapour fountains are thought to reach heights of 124 miles - around 20 times higher than the peak of Mount Everest. If confirmed, the observations prove that water from the moon's ice-covered ocean can easily reach the surface, which has important implications for future space missions. Many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. Scientists used images from the Hubble Space Telescope to identify unusual 'spikes' of hydrogen and oxygen in two distinct regions of the moon's southern hemisphere.They were observed for just seven hours at a time when Europa was at the furthest point of its orbit away from Jupiter, vanishing as the moon got closer. In addition to the anemones, the scientists saw fish who routinely swam upside down, the ice shelf serving as the floor of their submarine world, as well as polychaete worms, amphipods and a bizarre little creature they dubbed 'the eggroll', a four-inch-long, one-inch-diameter, neutrally-buoyant cylinder, that seemed to swim using appendages at both ends of its body, which was observed bumping along the field of sea anemones under the ice and hanging on to them at times. The anemones themselves measured less than an inch long in their contracted state--though they get three to four times longer in their relaxed state, Daly said. Each features 20 to 24 tentacles, an inner ring of eight longer tentacles and an outer ring of 12 to 16 tentacles. After using hot water to stun the creatures, the team used an improvised suction device to retrieve the animals from their burrows. They were then transported to McMurdo Station for preservation and further study. Because the team wasn't hunting for biological discoveries, they were not equipped with the proper supplies to preserve the specimens for DNA/RNA analyses, Rack said. Jupiter's icy moon Europa is slightly smaller than the Earth's Moon. Europa orbits Jupiter every 3.5 days and is phase locked -- just like Earth's Moon -- so that the same side of Europa faces Jupiter at all times. However, because Europa orbits in an oval, when it is close to Jupiter the tide is much higher. It is thought to have an iron core, a rocky mantle and a surface ocean of salty water, like Earth. Unlike on Earth, however, this ocean is deep enough to cover the whole surface of Europa, and being far from the sun, the ocean surface is globally frozen over. Many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. The specimens were placed in ethanol at the drilling site and some were later preserved in formalin at McMurdo Station. Many mysteries remain about the creatures, the scientists report. Though some sea anemones burrow into sand by using their tentacles or by expanding and deflating the base of their body, those strategies don't seem feasible for hard ice. It is also unclear how they survive without freezing and how they reproduce. There is no evidence of what they eat, although they likely feed on plankton in the water flowing beneath the ice shelf, Daly said. Rack said a proposal is being prepared for further study of this unusual environment, using a robot capable of exploring deeper in the ocean and further from the access hole through the ice. NASA is helping to finance the development of the new underwater robot because the Antarctic discoveries have implications for the possibility of life that may exist on Europa, the ice-covered moon of Jupiter. He said researchers hope to return to Antarctica as early as 2015 to continue studying the sea anemones and other organisms beneath the ice shelf.","Camera-equipped robot under Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf made the discovery .

Besic, who represented the chance to represent Germany at youth level in order to play for Bosnia-Herzegovina U21s in 2010, can also play at centre-back. The 21-year-old played in all three of Bosnia-Herzegovina's World Cup games, as Safet Susic's side bowed out after the group stages. Born in Berlin, Besic began his career with Hamburg, though disciplinary problems limited his opportunities at the Bundesliga club. In 2012 he moved to Ferencvaros and in his first season at the club helped them finish fifth in the Hungarian top division. Rare chance: Besic struggled to nail down a first-team spot at Hamburg because of disciplinary issues .","Toffees join the race for Bosnian-Herzegovina's World Cup star .

"By . Andy Hampson . Manchester United's famous 'Class of 92' hope their stewardship of Salford City will yield 'fairytale' results, according to Phil Neville. Neville is one of five of the much-loved home-grown core of United's all-conquering mid-to-late-1990s side to have invested in the non-League outfit. His . brother Gary, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs are also . involved as the quintet look not only to put something back into the . game, but engineer a rise through the divisions. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Phil Neville and Nicky Butt speak about Salford City . Ambition: Former Man United stars Phil Neville and Nicky Butt plan to guide Salford City to the Football League . Assistance: Manchester United coaches Neville and Butt help train members of Salford City's first team . Salford . City currently play in the Evo Stik League First Division North - . English football's eighth tier - but they have big ambitions. 'The short-term aim is to keep the club going on the level it is going,' said Neville. 'It is very sustainable. The committee do a great job and they will carry on doing that. We are not going to interfere in any way with how the club is run. 'But there is a fairytale story to this. Can we get into the Football League? Can we take Salford City as high as we possibly can? It is going to be a fantastic journey.' The former United players decided to get involved after coming together - with another of their famous contemporaries, David Beckham - to work on the 'Class of 92' documentary, which charted their collective success at Old Trafford. They wanted to invest in community football in Salford and the idea of taking over the city's club took hold. Class of 92: Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs visited the AJ Bell Stadium to watch Salford City's training session . Team spirit: Salford City's first team are made up of players from the local community . Neville stresses the group's aim is still very much community-based, about growing organically and not about pumping in vast sums to fuel an unsustainable promotion charge. He said: 'We are in this for the long haul, not the short term. 'We are not just going to do things to try to get us promoted in the quickest way possible. 'We see Salford as a class football club that does things in the right way. We want to continue with that theme. 'But there is a real hotbed of football within the Manchester and North West area. We have spoken to people in the area and I think they have been really excited, even people who don't support Salford City, for the impact we can have. 'We are really excited to take Salford City as high as we can and have a lot of fun and make a lot of local people happy. 'We want to give jobs to local people and build up an academy. These are plans we have.' The group are not putting any timescale on their project or setting any limit to their ambition. Nevertheless, reaching the Football League, and rising within it, is an undeniable objective. Bleeding red: Class of 92 duo Butt and Neville are both involved in Manchester United's coaching set up . Butt said: 'We feel football has gone so far away from the everyday man in the street that we felt it would be nice for us five, who have played at the highest level, won things and played for what we consider the biggest club in the world, to go and help a club like Salford, and the people of Salford, and try to get into the Football League. 'It is something we couldn't turn down and something we will thrive on. We really want to give our all for 10, 20, 30 years. 'Salford is close to all our hearts. It is where we grew up with football. It is something we are very passionate about. 'The club has massive potential. We know it is going to take a good few years to get where we want to be but you have got to have dreams. 'We dreamed of playing for Man United and that came true. We have now got dreams with Salford, to get as high as we can and into the Football League. Then who knows? 'People might laugh at us and smirk and say it won't happen but we believe fully, if we put all our effort into it and give it publicity, get sponsorship, we can get them to where we feel all the people of Salford will be happy.' Part of that publicity push includes a star-studded friendly between the 'Class of 92 and Friends' and the current Salford City side, which will be played at the AJ Bell Stadium on August 7. Tickets are on sale and organisers are hoping for an attendance close to the ground's 12,000 capacity. 'We are all taking it seriously,' Butt promised. 'It won't be a testimonial. We all want to stay fit and will have a lot of good players playing with us.'

"By . Ian Ladyman In Sao Paulo . After the semi-final we perhaps feared we may get after the astonishing events of Tuesday in Belo Horizante, there will now be one overwhelmingly satisfied team left in Brazil. That team is called Germany. Not only will Joachim Low and his players have an extra day to prepare for Sunday's final against Argentina, they will head to Rio knowing that they will have more than that advantage in their legs. While the Germans played for just 45 minutes competitively in beating Brazil - as odd as that sounds - Sunday's opponents have been through the wringer here, physically and emotionally. What Germany will also perhaps be aware of is they are beginning to look by far the superior team. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Messi star alongside a crocodile and a snake in Adidas advert . Big show: Lionel Messi will play in the World Cup final much to the chagrin of the Brazilian crowd . Frosty reception: Messi was booed when he stepped up to take a free-kick but it wouldn't bother him . Magic moment: The Argentina players react as they win the penalty shoot-out at Arena de Sao Paulo . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi highlights . Here in Sao Paulo on Wednesday night, we got the semi-final from hell. With Holland sticking to their modus operandi and showing a typical unwillingness to engage consistently with Argentina, this was a game that - to invoke an old cliche - needed an early goal to liven it up. In fact, the longer it went on it just needed a goal. Any old goal. It was, in truth, awful and Germany will have watched in their hotel realising they have little to fear ahead of their date at the Maracana. The final will not be one-sided. They never are. This World Cup has had its one freakish can-you-believe-it moment and Brazil were the victims. Germany, though, have shown themselves to be the outstanding team in this tournament. More pertinently, they are one remaining team that can claim to have improved as they have gone along. Germany have a midfield that has functioned brilliantly from the opening game and have talented players on the bench who are in form. They have the competition's best goalkeeper, a defensive unit that is imperfect but stable and have a capacity to score goals from all positions. Not phased: Louis van Gaal's Holland endured a tough opening period but held it together . Holland started with a bewildering 5-1 defeat of Spain in Salvador and kept on surprising people. Late goals have become their speciality and here last night they almost did it again. They had been second best for large parts of the 90 minutes of normal play but would have won it at the death had Javier Mascherano somehow not stretched out a leg to deny Arjen Robben when he seemed set to score from an angle. Immediately afterwards, Mascherano succumbed to cramp. It was that type of tackle. Holland, though, have stopped getting better and so, we must say, have finalists Argentina. Having been guided through this World Cup - on and off the field - by Lionel Messi, the South Americans arrived here without their other in-form player, Angel di Maria. They missed the Real Madrid forward and on Sunday they will miss him again. Certainly on this occasion, Messi could not do it on his own. An early free-kick briefly threatened to bother Dutch goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen. In the second period of extra time, meanwhile, a run down the right fashioned a chance at the far post for Maxi Rodriguez but it wasn't taken. Tied up: Holland's great attacking threat Arjen Robben was restricted to just six touches in the first half . Danger man: Argentina forward Ezequiel Lavezzi emerged as the most imposing threat on the pitch early on . But Messi was actually jeered by the crowd here with 20 minutes of normal time left when his over hit free-kick ballooned out of play. That summed up his evening. In fact, it summed up everybody’s evening. Argentina's best player was actually the PSG forward Ezequiel Lavezzi. It was the former Naples wide player who troubled Holland the most. In central defender Ron Vlaar, however, Holland had the game’s stand out performer and it was his effort, allied to the Dutch team's usual discipline and organisation, that got them through to the shoot-out. During the extra time period, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand tweeted that Vlaar had contributed the best defensive performance of the tournament. That the Aston Villa defender was asked to take Holland’s first kick in the shoot-out, though, was peculiar. Was that Louis van Gaal’s first big mistake of the tournament? Right stuff: Dirk Kuyt (left) was immense at wing-back and Argentina played away from him . Close quarters: Nigel de Jong (centre left) was never far from Lionel Messi, though Lavezzi put him in two minds . It seemed so, given that specialist Klaas Jan Huntelaar – who had scored an injury-time penalty winner against Mexico -  didn’t take one. Whatever the case, there was little surprise that Vlaar missed his kick. Certainly Vlaar had a good game over 120 minutes. It says something, though, that on a night that pitted two teams of repute, we talked about defenders as the penalty competition neared. Sadly, that was how it was. Given the success that Van Gaal has had this tournament by sticking rather than twisting, it was never likely that Holland would take the game to their opponents. Had Argentina scored then we may have seen a more open game. As it turned out Holland strangled it. Perhaps we have the right final. We do probably have the best two teams. It’s just that one is looking a little better than the other.

"By . Luke Norman . Brazil football great Zico says coach Luiz Felipe Scolari must be replaced if his country is to move past its disappointing World Cup performance. 'We should thank him (Scolari) and thank (assistant coach Carlos Alberto) Parriera too. But we need to choose new people with new thoughts about how to play the Brazilian way,' the three-time World Cup veteran said Thursday, just two days after Brazil's humiliating 7-1 semifinal loss to Germany. Zico said Sao Paulo coach Muricy Ramalho would be an ideal candidate to lead Brazil. Legend: Retired Brazilian footballer Zico says Luiz Felipe Scolari must be replaced if the team is to move on . 'He is one the greatest champions of the Brazilian league, which is one of the hardest in the world to win,' Zico said. Ramalho was reportedly offered the national job in 2010, but amid some confusion with his then club Fluminense, he turned the position down. He is known as a progressive coach, defined by tactical flexibility. 'We had no alternatives,' Zico said of Brazil's tactical approach to this World Cup. 'They stayed focused entirely on the success of the 2013 Confederations Cup. They kept the same formation and the same team. Everyone had a year to work out exactly how to play against Brazil.' Often referred to as the ""white Pele"", Zico represented Brazil at the 1978, 1982 and 1986 World Cups. He scored 52 goals in his 10-year international career. While his 1982 World Cup squad is considered by many Brazilians to be the nation's finest ever, Zico acknowledged that Scolari was not blessed with the same caliber of talent. Much to ponder: Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari (left) speaks with CBF president Jose Maria Marin on Thursday . 'If you look at the starting players in the last year, none of them were key players at their clubs,' he said. 'Look at Neymar, the best player in Brazil, but how many times was he on the bench for Barcelona last season? Fred, Marcelo, Hulk all played inconsistently. Even David Luiz and Oscar, you can't say they were first choices at Chelsea.' Zico said Brazil's problems run deeper than just a current dearth of talent, blaming poor administration, a lack of structure and a vacuum of leadership for the loss of the traditional 'Brazilian style'. Former Barcelona and current Bayern Munich coach Pep 'Guardiola has always said his style, his approach was inspired by the Brazilian national team, but now we don't have that style,' he said. Candidate: Zico suggests Sao Paulo head coach Muricy Ramalho as a potential replacement for Scolari . '(Johan) Cruyff has said we are not playing true Brazilian football. (Jose) Mourinho has said it doesn't seem like we know how to use our talent to play true football. I don't know why we don't listen to these great minds of football.' Keeping the country's brightest talent playing in the Brazilian league is a critical first step to recovery of Brazilian football, Zico said. 'The CBF (Brazilian football federation) needs to invite the heads of all the clubs in Brazil to a private meeting and ask them what they need to make sure the big names, the best players, play every Sunday in Brazil instead of in Europe.'

"By . James Restall . Watch out West Ham, there is a new footballing power on the march in east London. That is the message Barry Hearn believes his sale of Leyton Orient to Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti has sent to the Barclays Premier League side. Becchetti, the head of renewable energy and waste management firm the Becchetti Energy Group, acquired the club earlier this week and Hearn, who has been made Orient’s honorary president, believes that the takeover will allow Orient to compete with their Premier League neighbours. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hearn say Becchetti will change the club forever . Passing the baton: Hearn (right) has stepped aside after selling his shares to Becchetti (left) Italian job: Becchetti proudly holds aloft and Orient scarf at Brisbane Road on Thursday . 'If I was West Ham I would be petrified of this fella,' Hearn said. 'This guy can do anything he wants to do if he has the belief and passion. As a fan I don’t think I have been more excited in 20 years about what could happen to this football club. It is what dreams are made of.' Becchetti was at Wembley in May when Orient were pipped to promotion to the Championship by Rotherham on penalties in the League One play-off final, and the new owner has backed manager Russell Slade to go one better this season. 'I am already envisioning a Championship club,' Becchetti said. Even this year something can happen. We have to forget that penalty and we have to start from zero again. So near yet so far: Orient missed out on promotion to the Championship on penalties to Rotherham . 'Russell was told to give us a list of players and tell us in which position you need reinforcement. For every role you need give me a list of five players and give us the priorities. One minute later he was given permission to start negotiating with the first players on the list. I think he is still hard at work now. 'I am a little bit meticulous – the list will have to be signed by him. He didn’t hesitate – at the end of the season we will go over that list again and assess whether those were the right priorities.' Becchetti, who has never previously owned a football club, chose to buy Orient over Reading and Birmingham because for its lack of debt and London location. 'We decided to invest in football in England as this is the top notch industry in the world,' he said. 'It was difficult to find a team whose accounts are in order – we did not want to settle other peoples’ debts. Ambitious: Becchetti is targeting promotion in his first season at the club . 'Leyton Orient has a long and great history and roots are important to us. London is one of the most important centres of the world and the team deserves a higher position. These factors brought our focus to Leyton Orient. Last week Orient settled their dispute with the Premier League about West Ham’s move to the Olympic Stadium, with Becchetti confirming that the club would remain at their Brisbane Road home in Leyton for the foreseeable future. 'Generally I never look at what others do. I am focused on our project and I think that if our project is strong and everything is properly planned everything will happen naturally,' Becchetti said. Room to manouevre: Manager Russell Slade has already given Becchetti a list of transfer targets . 'If we have the right passion no one else will compromise our success. If we have the right dose of passion maybe other people will be worried about us. Let’s focus on the present. We have a stadium now, we have to think about the people who will come to our stadium and transmit their passion to our players' While Hearn sold his 90 per cent stake in the club to Becchetti earlier this week the boxing promoter still owns the stadium, which the Italian has the option of purchasing in two years’ time. Becchetti also confirmed that a deal is '99 per cent' complete to appoint former Inter Milan and Italy defender Mauro Milanese as Orient’s sporting director. 'He has a great desire to work in London and will support us and support Russell,' the chairman said.","Francesco Becchetti unveiled as new Leyton Orient owner .

That proved to be his one and only goal under the stewardship of Holloway, who was replaced by Pulis in November with Palace struggling in the relegation zone. Chamakh's performances improved once Pulis had taken over in south London and the former Bordeaux striker became a favourite with the Selhurst Park crowd.

"By . Mike Dawes . Colin Montgomerie twice sank three consecutive birdies en route to a six-under 65 on Thursday that put him a stroke clear atop the leaderboard after the opening round of the US Senior Open. The Scotsman started his round on the back nine at Oak Tree National and birdied 14, 15 and 16 in hot and humid conditions and then did it again at six, seven and eight. 'That was the key to the round, the three birdies in a row on the front nine, my back nine,' Montgomerie said. 'To birdie six, seven, eight was good. That got me to the position I am now.' Man of the moment: Colin Montgomerie speaks to the media following his opening-round 65 . Marco Dawson was second after a 66, and Mark Brooks was third after shooting 68. Bernhard Langer was one of five tied for fourth with a 69. Dawson, in his first Senior Open, started on the back nine and shot 2 under, then was steady on the front nine before scoring birdies on seven, eight and nine. The 50-year-old was pleased with the performance, especially considering the course's challenging reputation. 'It just seemed to happen; birdie, birdie, birdie the last three holes, so I ended up 5 under,' he said. 'I could have shot 2 under and still would have been a good round.' Brooks was 4-under after just four holes following consecutive birdies from 11-14 but dropped one stroke for the remainder of a largely steady round. 'I've been playing here since high school,' he said. 'I'm comfortable here. My mother and father both are Oklahomans, so I got a lot of Oklahoma blood in me.' Langer, who entered the Senior Open having already won three events this year, was in a five-way tie for fourth along with Vijay Singh, Kirk Triplett, Scott Dunlap and Gene Sauers. Across the water: Montgomerie (right) and Tom Lehman walk off the fourth green at Oak Tree National . 'They say you don't win a tournament on the first day,' Langer said. 'You can certainly lose it with a bad round, so I'm somewhere in the top 10 or top 20 after today, which is a good spot to be. Still have three rounds to go.' Kenny Perry, last year's Senior Open winner, shot a 75. Play was delayed for 77 minutes at the start due to the threat of lightning, and that meant three players did not complete their round before play was suspended due to darkness. With temperatures in the mid-30s and high humidity, Darrell Kestner withdrew after 14 holes and required treatment for heat-related issue. On the green: Montgomerie putts on the 13th hole on his way to a six-under-par opening round of 65 . Heavy rains Wednesday softened the course, but the heat Thursday made it hard later in the day. Changing winds added another degree of difficulty to an already long, tough course. 'It is kind of difficult to judge the wind out here,' Montgomerie said. 'You're always going to get breeze out here in Oklahoma. That's part of the test out here.' Weather is expected to remain a factor through the rest of the tournament, with temperatures expected to soar. Montgomerie said it will amount to a physical examination. In the mix: German Bernhard Langer waves to the crowd on the 9th green on his way to a first-round 69 . 'It's going to be grueling over the next three days,' he said. 'Concentration levels will be difficult to maintain for everybody out there, not just myself. 'I look forward to the challenge of trying to compete against the rest of the field, the golf course, which is superb, and also the weather conditions, which are very foreign to myself and most competitors.'

"By . John Hall . North Korea has used a huge parade marking the 64th anniversary of the start of the Korean War to call for a 'final victory' against U.S. 'imperialists'. Thousands gathered to watch and take part in the pro-government rally in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square, as party officials called upon civilians and military to assemble into a single force to take on the U.S. in what was described as a 'final confrontation'. The parade came just hours after North Korean officials called the release of a new Hollywood movie starring Seth Rogan an 'act of war' because it features a comedy storyline about a plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong-un. Scroll down for video . Display of force: Thousands gathered to take part in the pro-government rally in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square yesterday. Party officials called upon civilians and military to assemble into a single force to destroy the U.S. in what was described as a 'final confrontation' Troops: North Korean soldiers take part in the parade, pledging their support for leader Kim Jong-un. It came just hours after officials called the release of a new Hollywood movie starring Seth Rogan and James Franco an 'act of war' because it features a comedy storyline about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un . The state run Korean Central News Agency later reported an official statement describing the Korean War as 'aggression ignited by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet forces.' 'U.S. imperialists instigated traitor Syngman Rhee to launch a surprise . invasion against the DPRK and killed Koreans by the most cruel means and . methods and reduced this land to debris,' the National Peace Committee of Korea's statement added. 'Human history records the cruelest and the most shuddering crimes committed by the Hitler fascist junta during the Second World War but the atrocities perpetrated by the Yankee imperialists during the Korean war put the Hitler fascists into the shade in brutality, cruelty and barbarity,' it went on to say. Officials also called for Koreans on both sides of the border to unite into a single army to destroy the U.S. 'All Koreans in the north and the south should courageously turn out in a . sacred battle to deal sledge hammer blows at those enemies keen to . bring the dark clouds of a nuclear war to the land,' they said. 'The U.S. and the puppet forces should not run amuck, clearly mindful of . the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the second Korean war,' the statement went on to say. Camouflage: Following the Korean War anniversary parade - which included military displays (pictured) - the state run Korean Central News Agency reported an official statement describing the conflict as 'aggression ignited by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet forces' Call to arms: Officials told Koreans on both sides of the border to unite into a single army to destroy the U.S. 'All Koreans in the north and the south should courageously turn out in a sacred battle to deal sledge hammer blows,' they said . Nationalist: The huge parade came on the 64th anniversary of the start of the Korean War. It included displays of patriotism - including pro-government singing (pictured) The statement condemning the U.S. and South Korea was released just hours after a North Korean official condemned a new Hollywood film about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un as 'an act of war'. The U.S. faces 'stern' and 'merciless' retaliation if it fails to block the release of the film, an unidentified spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry said. He didn't mention the movie by name but was clearly referring to 'The Interview', which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco and will open in U.S. cinemas in October. The film tells the farcical story of a talk-show host and his producer who land an exclusive interview with Kim Jong-un, and are then asked by the CIA to assassinate him. Kim Jong-un is played in the film by Randall Park - an U.S.-born actor whose parents moved to the country from South Korea.

"By . Ian Parkes . McLaren are to operate in 2015 with the biggest budget in the team's history. McLaren Group CEO Ron Dennis confirmed at the start of this season his organisation were digging deeper into their pockets than ever before in order to compete this year, with the figure rumoured to be around £200million. The Woking-based marque, however, are still considerably off the pace of not just the dominant team this season in Mercedes, but also the likes of Red Bull and Williams . Money talks: Ron Dennis (right, with chancellor George Osborne) watches qualifying for the British Grand Prix . Confident: Eric Boullier insists McLaren are in a good position as they plan for the future . With Honda due to come on board as power-unit supplier from next year, it is apparent no expense is being spared in order to return to the front. 'We are not in a position where we are struggling to get money, we are perfectly fine, and with Honda coming on board, even more so,' said racing director Eric Boullier. 'For this year we've had our biggest ever budget and next year that is going to increase, so there are no worries.' Such remarks, however, would appear to fly in the face of the FIA's determination to cut costs, although only minor savings have been announced for next year by the World Motor Sport Council. 'Cost cutting and budgets are different,' insisted Boullier. 'If we want a £500million budget but spend only £100million then that is our problem, so they are different topics.' Boullier also insists McLaren's financial well-being means they will continue to be patient with regard to a title sponsor. Joy: Button celebrates after taking third position in the qualifying for the British Formula One Grand Prix . Tribute: Butto wore a special pink helmet in memory of his father at the British Grand Prix . Following Vodafone's withdrawal at the end of last season McLaren were due to announce a successor in December, but nothing materialised. Earlier this year Dennis then remarked a new sponsor would be signed up after the first two or three races, but again all remained quiet. Asked about the current situation, Boullier replied: 'We will announce it when we sign one. Obviously we haven't announced anything because we haven't finalised anything. 'There is no one-off reason. There are a few delays because there is nothing to sign or ready to be signed. Performance doesn't help, and the world economic situation is not the best, but McLaren has 32 partners and sponsors, so we are fine.'","McLaren still off the pace as they lag behind Mercedes, Red Bull and Williams .

"Japan’s Ayako Uehara mastered the windy conditions at Royal Birkdale to lead after the opening round of the Ricoh Women’s British Open on Thursday. Uehara recovered from a bogey on her first hole to fire five birdies in an opening four-under-par 68, finishing one shot ahead of American Mo Martin. Test: England's Charley Hull plays second shot out of the rough on the first hole . Martin birdied three of the last five holes to return a 69, with compatriots Mina Harigae and Morgan Pressel and Australian Sarah Kemp another shot back on two under.

But I played yesterday, a practice round, and it was pretty windy. 'It’s quite tight and it’s so intimidating off the tee.

"By . Associated Press . Renata de Mouro Moitinho sambas so fast her feet blur, but her partner moves with the bumbling tentativeness of a toddler taking his first steps. And in a way the strapping man in a tight spandex soccer jersey really is taking his first steps — his first samba steps, that is: Moitinho's dance partner for the evening is an Italian, visiting Brazil for the World Cup, and she is giving him his very first lesson in the nation's frenetically paced national dance. The two met at the Fan Fest in Rio de Janeiro, where 22-year-old Moitinho and a group of friends have been going throughout the monthlong tournament in order to, as she puts it, 'hunt foreigners' like the Italian, who declined to give his name. Moitinho's not alone. Dancing in the street: A woman from Brazil and a man from Argentina dance samba at the World Cup Fan Fest 2014, on Copacabana beach, in Rio de Janeiro . The past three weeks' flood of foreign soccer fans — the vast majority of them men — has been a boon for the single women of Brazil, where a demographic imbalance means they outnumber men by more than four million nationally. The imbalance, the result of higher mortality rates among young men, is particularly acute in Rio de Janeiro, where there are just over nine men for every 10 women, according to the 2010 census. That's about the same as New York City, another metropolis known for its lack of eligible single men. 'There are so many men everywhere these days, it's amazing,' Moitinho said, gesturing out over the sea of masculine faces at the Fan Fest. 'The World Cup is God's gift to women.' Brazil's World Cup bonanza hasn't come without a downside, with scattered reports of Brazilian women being sexually harassed by out-of-control fans. But in most cases, Brazilian women say foreign fans have behaved well, and have displayed a more enlightened, less macho attitude than that of Brazilian guys. Moitinho, who along with three friends braved the bus for more than two hours to get to the Fan Fest from their home in a distant Rio suburb, said foreigners just have a je ne sais quoi that their Brazilian counterparts lack. Brazil has a demographic imbalance between men and women, the result of higher mortality rates among young men, which is particularly acute in Rio de Janeiro . A Brazilian woman and a Colombian man dance during the World Cup Fan Fest. Brazilian women say foreign male fans have behaved well, and have displayed a more enlightened, less macho attitude than that of Brazilian guys . All smiles then: A fan of Brazil arrives at Mineirao stadium, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, before the start of semi-final against Germany . 'They're handsome, sweet, humble and generous,' Moitinho said as her friends grabbed hold of the Italian's hips to lead him in samba's hallmark sway. 'They respect women and don't come on strong like Brazilian men, who just grab on to you and try to kiss you right away. They're much more gentlemanly.' Catia Santiago, a 35-year-old single mother, agreed. 'I've never had the money to travel, so I thought all men were like Brazilians — very fast, very aggressive,' Santiago said as she soaked in the rays on Copacabana beach. However, Brazil's World Cup bonanza hasn't come without a downside, with scattered reports of Brazilian women being sexually harassed by out-of-control fans . 'Now I see that 'gringos,'' as foreigners of all nationalities are known in Brazilian Portuguese, 'aren't like that at all,' she said, adding that the language barrier hadn't proven a barrier at all. 'I'm hooked.' Not everyone is as enthusiastic. Brazilian newspapers have run stories with local women complaining about foreigners' wandering hands and sense of entitlement. Single women in Brazil outnumber men by more than four million nationally . A dejected looking Brazil fan. But at least her country is full of foreign men . A Brazil fan is embraced by a woman in a bar on Copacabana Beach following the 2014 FIFA World Cup semi-final match between Brazil and Germany . A report in the newspaper Estado de Minas cited several women as saying they had been groped by England fans at a street party in Belo Horizonte following the June 24 England vs. Costa Rica match there. Misperceptions about Brazilian women and misunderstandings over dating rituals here may have played a role in such incidents. Brazil, at once the birthplace of a bevy of supermodels like Gisele Bundchen and also the country with more Roman Catholics than any other, has long struggled to reconcile its reputation as a nation of beautiful, sexually liberated women in skimpy clothing with the conservative social mores that still hold sway throughout much of the country. Matthew Coelho, a 33-year-old from San Francisco who has spent several weeks in Brazil for the World Cup, said he was perplexed by gender relations in Brazil. 'On one hand, it's really easy to meet people here and they're really friendly and the girls here are excited to meet guys from the U.S.,' he said. 'But you sometimes have to think about people's motivations. 'I went out with this girl in Brasilia and like halfway through the date I began to realize that she just wanted me to pay for her Friday night out. In San Francisco, I'm used to splitting the bill, so it was a little weird.' He added that misperceptions cut both ways. 'It depends on the kind of people, but you get the impression that some women here think that if you're a foreigner that you're rich, which is not my case at all. I'm just a backpacker,' Coelho said, gesturing at his shorts and flip flops.","Brazil has a demographic imbalance between men and women .

Although it was wonderful to see my best friend get married, I was upset that I didn't look nicer in the pictures. 'I was disappointed that I had let myself get to that point.' Mrs Ellis saw her weight pile on in her late teens and her waistline became only more difficult to manage after she fell pregnant with Phoebe. She said: 'When I was pregnant I made the usual excuse that I was ""eating for two"". At the time I was working for a building company, covering arrangements for the whole of the south east of England, so I travelled around quite a lot, which meant I grabbed food where I could, often quite unhealthy treats.

New diet: Today, she typically eats Weetabix with fruit for breakfast, followed by a homemade Chicken tikka salad for lunch with yogurt and fruit for pudding. For her evening meal she might eat a regular-sized portion of chicken and mushroom noodles . She said: 'The first few days were difficult but today I don't consider it a diet.

Today, she typically eats Weetabix with fruit for breakfast, followed by a homemade Chicken tikka salad for lunch with yogurt and fruit for pudding. For her evening meal she might eat a regular-sized portion of chicken and mushroom noodles. She rarely snacks, but when she does she eats soft fruits like nectarines and mangos. Having achieved so much, Mrs Ellis is determined to reach her target weight of 11st. Old her: Mrs Ellis is motivated to stick to her programme by staying in touch with a fellow slimmer, with whom she swaps inspirational tips and recipe ideas and she doesn't want to slip back to her old ways . She said: 'I love Zumba and I recently started pole classes, which are great fun. When I was larger I never would have thought in a million years that I would do something like pole exercises.' Mrs Ellis is motivated to stick to her programme by staying in touch with another close friend and fellow slimmer, Michelle Leivers, 32, with whom she swaps inspirational tips and recipe ideas. She said: 'Michelle's slightly ahead of me at the moment but I know I'll get there. I'm very determined. Losing weight has made an amazing difference to my life. I'm much calmer now, even though I'm busy raising a three-year-old child. I'm much more comfortable in my own skin. 'I never shy away from the camera now. In my old life there were several occasions where we would go on trips and there were no pictures of me because I couldn't bare to have my photograph taken. Now, I always make sure I'm in the pictures alongside my friends and family.' Breakfast: toast with butter and marmite . Lunch: Two cheese and pickle sandwiches .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Diabetes is becoming a national health emergency, a charity has warned. Figures show that hundreds of people are diagnosed with the condition every day in Britain. Diabetes UK said that more than 280,000 people a year are diagnosed with diabetes – the equivalent of the population of Newcastle upon Tyne. Rise: A patient testing for blood sugar. More than a third of Britons have borderline diabetes, says a charity . Each day 738 people are told that they have type 2 diabetes – which is linked to being overweight – and 30 are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which is not linked to weight. About 3.8million people in the UK now have the condition and about 35 per cent of the population have borderline diabetes. Diabetes UK has called for more focus on preventing type 2 diabetes, saying that if the rate of people developing the condition continues the consequences could be ‘disastrous’. The charity’s chief executive,  Barbara Young, said: ‘It is deeply worrying that more than 700 people a day are being diagnosed with diabetes and this clearly shows the frightening scale of what is fast becoming a national health emergency. ‘If we continue to see people being diagnosed at this rate then the consequences will be disastrous. ‘As the number of people with diabetes grows, we are likely to see even more people endure devastating health complications such as amputation and kidney failure and more people die tragically young. Crisis: The majority of new cases diagnosed are Type 2, which is linked to weight (file photo) ‘It would also lead to an increase in NHS costs that would be simply unsustainable. As a country, we are still not giving diabetes healthcare the priority it needs and we also need to get much better at preventing type 2 diabetes before it is too late.’ Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said: ‘Public Health England welcomes Diabetes UK placing a refreshed emphasis on prevention. We take the growing number of people at risk of diabetes very seriously. ‘We can all reduce our risk by maintaining a healthy weight, using tips from our “eatwell plate” to get balanced, healthy portion sizes, and getting active every day. ‘We know that making those small changes, no matter how old we  are, will have a real impact on  our health.’ The latest figures have been derived from the National Diabetes Audit from analysis conducted by Diabetes UK and supermarket chain Tesco.","Around 3.8million Britons now have the condition, many of them Type 2 .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A mixture of thunderstorms, fires, chemicals and solar flares are thought to have been the catalyst for record levels of radiation detected over Bolivia in 2003. Researchers from Germany believe this combination of events created the ‘perfect storm’ of damage to the ozone layer, and caused levels to soar to 43.3 at the region’s Licancabur volcano. The report continued that data collected across the Andes show UV anomalies such as this could increase - and if they do it could lead to more radiation entering our atmosphere. In December 2003, a record UV index of 43.3 was detected at Bolivia's Licancabur volcano. Researchers believe thunderstorms, fires in the Amazon, chemicals from Antarctica and a solar flare combined to deplete the ozone layer and let harmful rays through. This spike is pictured in white around the Andes . On 29 December 2003, a radiation detector, known as a dosimeter, fitted to the top of the volcano recorded UV-B radiation level of 43.3. Although this spike was initially put down to detection error, two dosimeters placed more than 6 miles (10 km) apart saw the same peaks at the same time. On 4 November 2003, the largest solar flare ever recorded exploded from the Sun's surface, sending an intense burst of radiation streaming towards the Earth. Before the storm peaked, X-rays overloaded the detectors on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), forcing scientists to estimate the flare's size. The biggest previous solar flare on record was rated as an X20, on 2 April 2001 and 16 August 1989. By comparison, the strongest solar flare of 2014, which released radiation into space at 4.4 million mph in February, was an X4.9. The high for the volcano, and the Andes region in general across Peru, Bolivia and Chile is 25. By comparison, the average UV levels in New York reach only nine during the summer, with a high of 13 being spotted in Kenya and Australia. A high of 12 is seen as dangerous to people’s skin and eyes, according to the World Health Organisation. The Andes receives higher levels because of its elevation, naturally lower ozone levels and tropical sun. But this latest research claims these levels soared due to a rare combination of factors that destroyed the Earth’s protective layer, which typically blocks the sun’s radiation. This included seasonal thunderstorms over the Andes, fires in the Amazon, ozone-depleting chemicals from Antarctica and a large solar flare that was emitted the month before the spike. The Andes and the Licancabur volcano (pictured) receives higher levels because of its elevation, naturally lower ozone levels and tropical sun. But, the latest research claims these levels soared due to a rare combination of factors that destroyed the Earth's protective layer, which typically blocks the sun's radiation . This chart reveals the different radiation levels spotted on Bolivia's Licancabur volcano in January 2004 - two weeks after the spike. Before the solar flare in November, levels were around 20. The high is 25. By January 17 it reached 30 and researchers state this is evidence that the solar flare made an impact on radiation . ‘The solar flare is the big question mark here,’ researcher Nathalie Cabrol, a planetary scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, told Live Science. These images plot total ozone layer levels on 10, 15 and 17 January. Purple areas show where the column amount decreased . ‘The major spikes in UV pretty much match exactly with this major solar activity.’ The discovery was made as the researchers were trying to identify environments in the Andes that were similar to those found on Mars. Other contributing factors may also include elevated levels of water transported from the troposphere into the stratosphere at very low temperatures. ‘Although the evidence is circumstantial, an X45 class solar flare also took place on November 4, 2003, becoming the largest event ever recorded with instruments,’ explained the researchers. ‘Solar particle events have been shown to affect atmospheric chemistry and foster ozone depletion. 'Our instruments were deployed two weeks after the X45 flares and showed the most extreme UV variability between the time of their deployment and the end of March 2004. ‘The coincidental timing of the historical solar activity with seasonal UV maximum, and weather pattern that brings atmospheric instability over the Andes may have been additional factors that could have contributed to the generation of these unprecedented record values.’ The results were published in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Science. Recent models suggest that tropical stratospheric ozone will slightly decrease in the coming decades, potentially resulting in more UV anomalies. If they become more common, the researchers explained that events of this magnitude may have societal and ecological implications. The spike was so extreme, it was initially put down to detection error. But two dosimeters placed more than 6 miles (10 km) apart saw the same peaks at the same time. This image shows the location of the dosimeter on the volcano, and one on the nearby Laguna Blanca .","In December 2003, a world-record UV index of 43.3 was detected in Bolivia .

A Nasa notebook was stolen last year that contained the instructions for controlling the International Space Station, the Agency’s inspector general has revealed. Paul K Martin told the U.S Congress yesterday in a testimony highlighting Nasa’s security challenges, that the notebook was one of 48 mobile computing devices belonging to the Agency that was lost or stolen between April 2009 and April 2011. In a written report he said: ‘The March 2011 theft of an unencrypted Nasa notebook computer resulted in the loss of the algorithms used to command and control the International Space Station. The International Space Station seen from Space Shuttle Endeavour: Nasa has revealed that a laptop containing codes to control it was stolen . ‘Other lost or stolen notebooks . contained Social Security numbers and sensitive data on Nasa’s .

The audit, of a quarter of the loaned samples, found 19 per cent of researchers could not account for samples, or held items that Nasa records showed were on loan to someone else. One researcher still had nine lunar samples he borrowed 35 years ago and had never worked on them. Another still had 36 moon samples he has finished studying 16 years earlier. The audit also unearthed records that listed hundreds of samples that no longer existed. In 2010's Delaware case, Nasa loaned the Mount Cuba observatory a disk of moon rocks and moon dust in 1978 with the loan expiring in 2008. According to the report, Nasa contacted the observatory in 2010 to learn that its manager had died and the observatory couldn't find the sample. However according to the astronomers the samples had been returned to Nasa.

"By . Simon Jones . Gareth Barry insists he has not given up hope of an England recall despite not playing for his country for more than two years. The midfielder has just signed a new three-year contract at Everton despite being 33 and believes age should be no barrier for club or country. Barry has earned 53 caps since making his international debut in 2000 and was a scapegoat for England’s miserable showing at the World Cup in South Africa. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gareth Barry discuss his permanent move to Everton . Right move: Gareth Barry revealed he is delighted to be spending the next few years at Everton . But after watching England crash out of the World Cup in Brazil, he said: 'You watch England’s games and still want to be playing, singing the national anthem. 'It’s a massive buzz. As a kid, you always dream of playing for England. Thats’s why I am still here; I’ve not been capped for a couple of years, but I’ve not retired. 'You sort of hope for that chance to come again. Any player who feels they still have a chance of playing for England and thinks maybe they should have been picked will watch the games and feel exactly the same.' Staying put: Barry holds aloft Everton's new shirt with Martinez atthe club's Finch Farm training ground . Everton have ended up paying £2million to Manchester City for Barry as part of their initial loan agreement but on last season's showing it is money well spent. And he is looking to build on a promising start. Barry said: 'In terms of a whole campaign, last season has to be one of my best. The performances the team put out, the club record points total in the Premier League, the big wins - there were so many positives. 'But that is last season. Now we try to improve on that, and if we do improve then we are going to be going to some very good places. International ambitions: Barry says he still want s to play for England despite not making the World Cup squad . 'We will have to treat this season with respect. It is going to be very different with the Europa League and there are a lot more games. But I'm sure the manager will have his plans for that challenge already and I'm looking forward to it. 'The whole squad is always so keen to learn and never satisfied. From the manager, right through the coaching staff, to the players, everybody wants to improve.' Manager Roberto Martinez believes Barry will continue to influence the younger players in his squad, such as Ross Barkley and John Stones, giving them invaluable guidance. Barry added: 'It's good to be in the dressing room alongside so much young talent. While they are young, they are ready now and that is fantastic. There is a lot of experience here already and if I can add something to that, it is great.'","Gareth Barry has won 53 caps for England since making his debut in 2000 .

"By . Margot Peppers . A mother-of-two from Bethesda, Maryland, has told how her five-year-old daughter was treated like she had a disease for wanting to eat healthy snacks at her summer camp. Caron Gremont wrote on the Huffington Post that at an orientation meeting, parents were shown the menu of snacks their children would be given at the camp, which consisted of a daily rotation of Oreos, Cheese-Its, Chips Ahoy, pretzels, cookies and cheese curls. When she asked that her daughter be given more healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables, the counselors told her she could send the 'special' food to the nurse's office, where her child could collect it daily. A mother's concern: When Caron Gremont (second right) requested nutritional camp snacks for her daughter instead of cookies and chips, counselors treated her five-year-old's healthy eating habits like a disease . Unhealthy: The normal snack menu provided for campers consists of a daily rotation of cookies, chips, crackers and pretzels, and a serving of fruit only once a week . Ms Gremont, founder of child nutrition website First Bites, noted that singling out a child for eating healthily is a backwards step in a country where one-in-three children is overweight or obese. Since the camp children would be doing daily sports and activities, she asserted they would need 'a snack that provides them with energy and carries them from lunch to dinner'. She was shocked not only that the daily offering of snacks consisted of mainly crackers, cookies and chips, but that it featured a serving of fruit just once a week. After complaining to the head counselor, she was eventually sent to the camp nurse, who told her she could send in 'special' snacks for her daughter, which would be stored in the nurse's office. Every afternoon, the counselors said, her daughter could go to the nurse to collect her food. But Ms Gremont was disconcerted when she realized that her five-year-old's healthy eating habits were being treated like a disease. 'The camp was very happy to accommodate our ""special"" needs,' she wrote. 'What message does it send to tell my daughter she needs to get her ""healthy food"" from the camp nurse?' '[They] reassured me that with all the allergies today, our daughter wouldn't be the only one eating a ""special"" diet.' Surprisingly, when she asked whether other parents had made similar requests, Ms Gremont discovered that the camp only received 'one or two' complaints about the snacks per year. She notes that there is an irony in the fact that the American Medical Association officially classified obesity as a disease last week, yet her daughter was being singled out for healthy eating as if it were an irregular diet. 'My daughter doesn't think her diet is ""special,""' she wrote. 'To her, it's normal. She eats a wide variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day.' Instead of treating healthy children differently, Ms Gremont states that camps as well as schools and teachers have a duty to protect children, which includes keeping them safe at the snack table. Besides, she wrote: 'What message does it send to tell my daughter that to eat ""healthy food,"" she needs to get her snack at the camp nurse every afternoon?'","Caron Gremont complained about the unhealthy snacks at her daughter's summer camp - a daily rotation of Oreos, Cheese-Its, cookies and chips .

"By . Sam Webb . When Ukraine's fugitive president fled for an unknown destination, he left behind his sprawling luxury estate in Mezhyhirya, an hours drive from Kiev. The people of the country, who earn on average earn between £2,400 and £4,200 a year, flocked to see Viktor Yanukovich's hastily vacated property. What they found stunned them. The property in Mezhyhirya, is packed with riches well beyond the reach of a man with an official salary of less than £15,000. Sculptures worth millions, statues, a white Steinway piano, gold-plated taps, towel rails and other fixtures, chandeliers everywhere, valuable paintings and elegant glass and tableware. He even had personalised bottles of fine brandy featuring a photo of his smiling face. Scroll down for video .

The property also boasts a golf course, helicopter pad, cinema room and a garage filled with classic sports cars worth millions, while in the exotic gardens Australian and African ostriches stretched their legs. Graeco-Roman statues - a Goddess covering her modesty with her hair, lovers intertwined - decorated the lawns. Ornate ponds - half frozen on Saturday - nonetheless bubbled with water being pumped through them. Love-seats and colonnaded meeting places dot the estate. There is a Russian bath-house and on a hilltop, looking down on the Dnipro river through trees, is a plaza for a barbecue. A replica of a ship also sits on a lake. Most of the visitors shook their heads in wonderment at the ambitions of a president who had always proclaimed that he was on the side of the poor people of Ukraine. Yesterday the lavish estate of the Ukraine's ex-prosecutor-general Viktor Pshonka was exposed as another example of the extravagant homes the country's former leaders and top officials enjoyed living in. With Pshonka reportedly having fled the country, the photos show the exterior and interior of the home, in the village of Gorenichy outside the capital Kiev. A Reuters photographer said that with Pshonka gone, journalists and people entered the house to inspect it. The scale of the opulence of homes used by public officials is seen by opposition activists as proof of large-scale corruption among the country's elite, one of the key causes of public anger which led to the protests in Kiev and other cities. Ostentatious: A dining room, complete with chandeliers, a dining table with space for 16 and what appears to be a marble floor . People look at sculptures of a parrot, an angel and an ornate egg through windows of the Mezhyhirya residence .

A pair of candelabras, a gilded closk and a model of a ship in a glass cage . Tickling ivories: A Maidan (Independence Square) self-defence activist plays a piano as they guard the Mezhyhirya . Documents recovered from Yanukovych's presidential home that reportedly show evidence of widespread corruption have started to appear online. Journalists and volunteers have been analysing the papers after divers retrieved them from the lake at the sprawling estate in Mezhyirya.They say the documents show how millions was lavished on construction, furnitures and animals. Lesya Ivanova, one of the journalists, told Euro News: 'Some documents were collected from the surface of the water, others were retrieved by the divers.... we had to unfold and dry them immediately to preserve the information.'

The papers are being uploaded to the purpose-built website Yanukovychleaks.org. Journalist Oleksandr Akymenko said: 'These documents are very valuable. They could help prove corruption schemes used by Viktor Yanukovych personally, his team and his inner circle.' Russia today claimed that the CIA could be behind the disappearance of Yanukovych. The official newspaper of Vladimir Putin's government alleged that American intelligence may have secretly flown the disgraced tyrant - now accused of mass murder - to a new life after giving him personal guarantees if he left the political stage. The extraordinary claim in Rossiyskaya Gazeta will inevitably be seen as a smokescreen for similar suspicions that Russia is now shielding former ally Yanukovych, possibly at the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet in Crimea.

"By . Chris Hastings . Doctor Who supremo Steven Moffat has revealed there is no reason why a woman can’t play the world’s most famous Time Lord. Moffat, 52, who is the show’s lead writer and head producer, said he had already put plot lines and references in previous shows to make it possible. He said: ‘There is absolutely no reason why a woman can’t play  Doctor Who and I am the person who has made that possible.’ Scroll down for video . Possibility: Lead writer and producer Steven Moffat, right, has floated the possibility of a female Doctor in the wake of the 50th anniversary show, right. It features Matt Smith and David Tennant as well as John Hurt (not pictured) playing three different versions of the Time Lord . But Moffat insisted it was important to get the right person for the role and that it would be wrong to cast ‘a woman’ just as it would be to cast ‘a man’. He said: ‘You cast an individual who you think is perfect for the part now and you don’t make rules for yourself before you start. ‘It is a question of who is the person who sets your brain on fire as the Doctor. Right now, without question – and everybody seems to have had the same reaction – that person is Peter Capaldi.’ Moffat’s comments coincided with last night’s 50th anniversary special, The Day Of The Doctor, which starred Matt Smith, David Tennant and John Hurt playing three different versions of the Doctor. His support for a female Doctor does, however, put him at odds with Peter Davison, the fifth doctor, who earlier this month said it would be wrong to cast a woman in the role. Capaldi, who is best known for the comedy The Thick Of It, has yet to make his first appearance but speculation continues that his eventual replacement will be a woman. Female favourites:  Clockwise from top left, Tilda Swinton, Billie Piper, Helen Mirren and Olivia Colman . Last night bookmakers William Hill were offering odds of 8/1 that the role would go to a woman the next time it became vacant. Several actresses have been linked to the part – including Billie Piper, who played the Doctor’s companion Rose Tyler, Broadchurch star Olivia Colman, Dame Helen Mirren and Oscar-winning Tilda Swinton. Moffat, who spent a year planning the anniversary special which was broadcast in 94 countries, said the casting of Capaldi had been one of the show’s biggest-ever gambles. Heritage: Ex-Doctor Tom Baker, left, waits with four other previous Time Lords at the 50th anniversary convention in London on Friday . He said: ‘He is an older man for a start and unlike some of the other actors who have taken on the role, he is already famous.’ Moffat added that last night’s special had sent the show in a new direction. He said: ‘Every so often Doctor Who becomes a brand new show and it did that again last night. ‘People who saw last night’s  episode will now realise that the Doctor is on a very different journey – a different journey than the one he had. His mission statement has changed.’ Yesterday Tom Baker was one of the former Doctors who took part in a 50th anniversary convention at London’s ExCel Centre. The new Doctor Who made a surprise appearance in the sci-fi favourite’s  50th anniversary television special  last night. Peter Capaldi’s appearance lasted just a split second and a global audience of more than 100 million had to make do with a shot of just his eyes. Capaldi, 55, joined his predecessors in the anniversary episode The Day Of The Doctor to see off a threat from the Doctor’s old enemy the Daleks. First look at the new Doctor Who: Peter Capaldi appeared briefly last night's 50th anniversary special . But the BBC1 show also saw the return of some familiar faces. Tom Baker, the longest serving Doctor, appeared at the end of the episode, and former companion Billie Piper was also part of the action. But the episode was dominated by a storyline featuring departing Doctor Who Matt Smith and two earlier incarnations, David Tennant and John Hurt. Writer Steven Moffat packed the episode with one-liners, and some of the best jokes centred on the different personalities of the squabbling Time Lords. The show ended with a spectacular line-up of all the previous Doctors. You know you’re getting old when the Doctor Whos are getting younger. You know you’re ancient when you remember your crush on the first Doctor Who, William Hartnell .  .  . And you know you’re closer to death (and possibly senile) when you watch the show and haven’t the slightest idea what is going on. The 50-year anniversary special began  in spectacular fashion – the special effects and sound were as good as  those on  any major Hollywood movie. Billie Piper (left) and John Hurt (right) appeared in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary special last night . The plot, however, left more to be desired. After receiving orders from one of those Redgrave women (the one who talks like .  .  . well, Elizabeth I, except,  in this case, she was just the messenger from Her Majesty), the current Doctor Who (Matt Smith) delivered some good gags, confused as to why the wrong queen was on the throne. Ms Redgrave threw up at some point and became a Zygon. Don’t ask me why. Then we had John Hurt (the War Doctor) finding Billie Piper dressed in a sheet/shroud and possibly coming on to him. I was already hiding behind the sofa, but for different reasons from those that prompted me to do so 50 years ago! The plot grew ever more complicated when Smith met the previous doctor, David Tennant, who had been wooing Elizabeth I on a horse – although from my PBS (Position Behind Sofa), it might have been Billy Connolly and Queen Victoria in Mrs Brown. ‘You’re my future selves?’ asked Hurt, when he met the pair in a forest, shortly after Matt and David had taken it in turns to wear a fez (although, again, from PBS, it might have been Tommy Cooper). Dearie me. You wait for ever for a doctor to come along and then three come along together. As the threesome stood poised at the red button, ready to destroy the world, they opted to follow the path of courage – cue close-up of everyone’s Cyberman-style glowing teeth. Very scary. The episode was full of great lines, some of them hilarious, but ultimately the episode was  a triumph of style over less impressive substance. And, thankfully, there were Daleks. Nothing, however, will come close to the terror of those first tin men with laryngitis in black and white. Except, perhaps, Jemma Redgrave’s vomit.","Steven Moffat says there is 'no reason' a female Time Lord couldn't happen .

Ed Miliband has told friends he will fight to stay on as Labour leader even if he leads the party to election defeat next year. The beleaguered Labour leader believes he can ‘do a Kinnock’ and go on for years, regardless of the General Election result, a Shadow Cabinet source told the Daily Mail. He has told friends the personal sacrifices he has made – including tearing apart his family by standing against his brother David in the 2010 Labour leadership battle – mean he has earned the right to a second chance. Mr Miliband also believes he is building a long-term vision for Britain that deserves more time to succeed, and is making it known he will not go quietly. ‘There’s lots of talk about who should replace Ed if we lose next year, but it all misses one big point: he has no intention of going,’ the source said. ‘Ed believes he’s given up too much – including his relationship with his own brother – just to quit after one election defeat. He’s letting it be known he wants to continue. It isn’t realistic, but that’s what he thinks.’ Mr Miliband’s stubbornness will alarm the growing band of Labour figures who fear that voters have already decided he does not have what it takes to be prime minister. One senior Labour MP said it was ‘laughable’ to suggest Mr Miliband could remain as leader after taking the party to defeat. They added: ‘Elections are increasingly presidential, and if we do lose then it will be in large part down to the fact that  people don’t see Ed as prime minister. There is no way he could stay on.’ In recent times, major party leaders have almost invariably quit after failing to win an election. The only exception is Neil Kinnock, who led Labour to successive defeats in 1987 and 1992. Lord Kinnock, who has acted as a mentor to Mr Miliband, publicly criticised the Labour leader’s detractors at the weekend. He claimed that shadowy ‘vested interests’ – including the banks, energy firms and the media – had joined forces to undermine Mr Miliband because they fear he will take them on if he makes it into No 10. Veteran Labour Left-winger Michael Meacher made a similar defence of Mr Miliband yesterday, saying he was the victim of a ‘powerful establishment’. Mr Meacher described the briefing against Mr Miliband by Labour MPs as ‘despicable’, and suggested it was being orchestrated by supporters of his brother David. Mr Meacher also said it was  ‘rubbish’ to suggest that Mr Miliband struggles to connect with ordinary people – but a series of polls suggest the public do not see him as a future PM. A YouGov survey at the weekend found more than half of voters see Mr Miliband as ‘weak’, with 60 per cent saying he is not up to the job of being prime minister. Just one in ten voters believes he would make a good prime minister. Labour . cosied up to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg yesterday by confirming it would . bring in a ‘mansion tax’ to clobber families living in valuable homes. Shadow . Chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would adopt the flagship Lib Dem policy . almost wholesale to tackle ‘unfairness’ in the tax system, if it wins . the General Election next year. Both . parties are now committed to imposing swingeing new council tax bands . on all homes worth more than £2 million, regardless of the income of the . occupants. The plans will affect tens of thousands of homes, mostly in London and the South East. Mr . Balls said homes worth more than £5million, £10million and £20million . would face even higher bands, with charges running into tens of . thousands of pounds a year. Labour’s . move opens the way for co-operation with the Lib Dems and could form . the centrepiece of a Coalition deal after the next election. The . Tories condemned the proposals, with London Mayor Boris Johnson warning . a mansion tax would be ‘brutally unfair’ on people whose family homes . have risen in value.","Miliband believes he can go on for years as leader, regardless of success .

"By . Helen Pow . Caught: Mohammed Ahmed, 21, pictured, was arrested for soliciting a prostitute last week while he was honeymooning with his new wife in Florida . The honeymoon is over for Mohammed Ahmed. The 21-year-old Illinois man was arrested for soliciting a prostitute last week while he was honeymooning with his new wife in Florida. Ahmed was among 92 people nabbed in a prostitution sweep conducted by Polk County Sheriff's Office. The alleged john answered an online ad, on website Backpage.com, which, to his horror, turned out to be planted by an undercover deputy as part of the four-day operation. Ahmed left his newlywed in their room at the Omni Hotel in Champions Gate when he went off on his sojourn to pay for sex. When he never returned, the worried bride called the sheriff's office to report him missing. She was quickly told he was in fine health - but wouldn't be resuming the vacation because he was in a jail cell having been booked on charges of soliciting prostitution. The catch of a husband was also charged with possession of marijuana. During the four-day sting, police caught 12 pimps, 39 alleged prostitutes and 39 suspected johns. One . of the worst of the batch was 45-year-old youth minister Samuel Yoon . from California who came to the undercover location believing he was . going to have sex with a 14-year-old girl. Jail: The suspects were booked into Polk County Jail, pictured . 'Prostitution is illegal, and those who commit or who derive proceeds from this crime in Polk County can expect to go to jail,' Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement. 'The nexus between prostitution and other crime, such as illegal drugs, violence against women, and human trafficking is a real problem.' He said whether it is on the street or online, prostitution is illegal and his office would continue to investigate and arrest those involved.","Mohammed Ahmed, 21, was arrested for soliciting a prostitute last week while he was honeymooning with his new wife in Florida .

"By . Darren Boyle . Michael Wade Propst took the school bus on a 14-mile joyride across Bay County, Florida when he was arrested by the local sheriff's department . Police in Florida have arrested a 12-year-old boy who stole a school bus and took it for a 14 mile joy ride to a supermarket. Michael Wade Propst found the keys inside the yellow bus and took it from outside a house in Parker, Florida. The driver did not notice the bus had been taken and it was not reported stolen. The youngster was able to control the bus along the main road until he got to the Walmart superstore in Bay County, Florida. His trip came to an end when an employee at the store noticed that the driver was having difficulty parking the vehicle. Wal-Mart employee Roy Hoover told News Herald: 'He was having a hard time parking it, like he'd never drove one before.' Propst . was arrested by Bay County Sheriff's department and was charged with . grand theft of an item worth more than $100,000 and felony criminal . mischief. The bus . has an eight-foot long white scrape along the side of the vehicle, but . Propst has told deputies that he cannot remember hitting anything during . his joy ride. When questioned by deputies, Propst said he was 'getting gas'. Bay District School's head of security Mike Jones said Propst looked assured driving the bus despite his young age. He said: 'You have to take a weeklong course to operate a bus like that. Yet at 12 he was able to drive one, and he didn’t just take it around the block.' Major Tommy Ford of Bay County Sheriff's Office said he was investigating the cause of the damage on the side of the bus. He said: 'We don’t know if that occurred before he got the bus, but there’s a potential he ran into something white.' The school bus, pictured, was stolen outside the bus driver's house in Parker, Florida . Walmart apologised for the photo and said the item was sold by one of the company's online marketplace sellers and not directly by Walmart . Propst took the bus from outside the driver's home and drove 14 miles across Florida to a Wal-Mart where he claimed he was just 'filling it with gas'","Bus driver had left the keys in the bus on the night it was stolen .

"By . Brendan Carlin . Ed Miliband yesterday became the second political party leader to enter the row over Charles Saatchi assaulting Nigella Lawson. The Labour leader insisted that he would have intervened had he had seen the millionaire art dealer grabbing his wife by the throat in exclusive London restaurant Scott’s. His comments came after Nick Clegg was heavily criticised last week for suggesting that the couple’s row could have been ‘just a fleeting thing’. The Labour leader's comments came after Nick Clegg was heavily criticised last week for suggesting that the couple’s row could have been ‘just a fleeting thing’ During a radio interview, the Deputy Prime Minister also failed to condemn Saatchi and refused to say whether he would have stepped in if  he had witnessed the incident. But Mr Miliband said yesterday: ‘I thought they were horrifying pictures. ‘Honestly, if you are passing by something like that happening, our duty is to intervene. 'If I had been in that situation, passing  by in those circumstances, the right thing to do is to go up to somebody involved in that and say, “What’s going on?” ’ Neil Kinnock also waded into the row by revealing that he would have 'felt compelled' to intervene the row between Nigella and her husband . Yesterday, Neil Kinnock also waded into the row by revealing that he would have ‘felt compelled’ to intervene. The former Labour leader said: ‘It’s the kind of thing where I would have no hesitation to step in – even if the woman wasn’t Nigella. ‘There is no circumstance in which a man should physically assault a woman. ‘I knew Nigella when she was with her first husband – way back. She’s a lovely woman: joyful, highly intelligent and independently minded. ‘She was superhuman with her first husband.’",The Labour leader insisted that he would have intervened had he had seen the millionaire art dealer grabbing his wife by  the throat .
"By . Victoria Woollaston . In its heyday, Bitcoin’s value soared passed $1,100 but just five months later, the currency’s price has plummeted. Earlier this week, Chinese banks sent notices to local Bitcoin exchanges stating their accounts would be frozen on April 15 as part of a wider national crackdown. Chinese trading makes up a large volume of Bitcoin transactions, and the news saw its value drop to $350 - a loss of around $100 in a single day. Earlier this week, Chinese banks sent notices to local Bitcoin exchanges stating their accounts would be frozen om April 15 as part of a wider national crackdown. The news saw the value of the currency drop to $350 (£209) - a loss of around $100 (£60), according to Bitcoin Average's price index, pictured . Bitcoin is a piece of data confined to an internet network by an algorithm. Once released it can be traded and used like money online and can be purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a form of currency. As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins. It has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future of money. It is not centrally controlled and its unique and complex set-up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according to the developers. There are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold. The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. This equates to a drop of almost 20 per cent in over 24 hours. Exchange BTCTrade.com made its announcement on Thursday, followed shortly by BTC100.org and Huobi. ‘Interestingly, it appears Chinese banks started with smaller exchanges before working up to those with larger trading volumes,’ said Jon Southurst at CoinDesk. The drop follows a similar decline in Bitcoin value in February when the Mt. Gox exchange went offline after rumours $375 million-worth had been stolen. The rumoured theft and subsequent shutdown caused problems for the online currency's public and financial image, and prices plummeted by 22 per cent. It fell from $550 down to $418. This is in sharp contrast to November, when Bitcoin passed the $1,000 (£613) mark for the first time since it was introduced in 2009. The price for a single Bitcoin almost quadrupled from its previous record high of $267 (£165) less than three weeks before. This equates to a drop of almost 20 per cent in over 24 hours. The drop follows a similar decline in Bitcoin value, stock image pictured, in February when the Mt. Gox exchange went offline. Rumours about hacks and theft caused problems for the online currency's public image, and prices plummeted by 22% . Chinese trading accounts for a large volume of Bitcoin transactions, which fell to 31,849 this morning, down from 121,824 at the start of March. As this graph from Coinbase demonstrates. Chinese banks are clamping down on the currency after speculation about hacks and thefts . Analysts at the time claimed the demand for Bitcoin followed increased awareness about the benefits of the currency, and a drive to move it into the mainstream. Chinese banks are clamping down on the currency, however, after speculation over hacks and thefts. For example, in June 2011, hackers fraudulently dropped the worth of Bitcoins by 1 per cent after using a Bitcoin traders account to transfer Bitcoins and then sell them on, fluctuating the price. In April last year, CoinLab sued Mt. Gox for $75 million (£44 million) for breach of contract. The partnership between the companies, agreeing that CoinLab would managed the North American Mt. Gox services went south after CoinLab accused Mt. Gox of not transferring them the existing U.S. and Canadian customers. Then in February 2014, Mt. Gox suspended all withdrawals indefinitely, even after some traders had been waiting months for their withdrawals, causing investors to worry about the state of the currency.","Chinese banks sent notices to local Bitcoin exchanges earlier this week .

"By . Jason Groves, Political Correspondent . Ed Miliband was accused of resorting to a ‘crass’ class war  by members of his own party last night over a political broadcast depicting Tory ministers as out-of-touch toffs who bully Nick Clegg. The four-minute film, broadcast as part of Labour’s campaign for this month’s European parliament elections, makes no mention of either Europe or the party. Instead, Labour has produced a parody of a 1950s B-movie, featuring actors playing Coalition ministers with caricature posh voices receiving afternoon tea from servants around the Cabinet table. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband has been accused of resorting to 'crass' class warfare in Labour's new advert for the European elections which features a shrinking Nick Clegg character (pictured) The US-style attack advert is based on the 1950s film The Incredible Shrinking Man and seeks to portray Tories (character on right) as out-of-touch toff who bully Nick Clegg (left) The film, titled The Un-credible . Shrinking Man, shows an actor playing Mr Clegg shrinking in size as he . ditches policies such as opposition to university tuition fees. By the end of the film – a parody of the US 1957 movie The Incredible Shrinking Man – he is a tiny doll-like figure. The ad is thought to be the first product of Labour's new collaboration with American election guru David Axelrod . One Tory ‘minister’ suggests he should be hunted, before an actor playing David Cameron sets the Downing Street cat on him. The US-style attack ad is thought to be the first product of Labour’s relationship with American elections guru David Axelrod. A Labour source said: ‘It was aimed at younger people who don’t usually engage with politics and we think it has been effective.’ Party election campaign co-ordinator Douglas Alexander said the film was ‘a bit of fun’ but made a ‘serious point’. But critics in the party say its relentlessly negative message suggested a lack of ambition. Some MPs said it recalled the 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election when an attempt to paint Tory candidate Edward Timpson as a toff backfired and led to a humiliating defeat. One former minister described the film as ‘crass’. He added: ‘We tried waging class war in Crewe. It failed then and it will fail now. 'The trouble is the kids in the leader’s team are probably too young to remember that.’ Another Labour MP said the broadcast was ‘depressing’, adding: ‘Where was the positive vision to attract swing voters?’ Mark Ferguson, editor of the influential grassroots website LabourList, said the film lacked a ‘positive agenda’. Left-wing Guardian columnist Owen Jones said it was ‘a classic example of politics with the hope stripped away’. The advert takes place around the Cabinet table as 'posh' Tories lead by an actor playing David Cameron force Nick Clegg to backtrack on policies such as tuition fees . As Clegg abandons each of the policies he shrinks into his suit. However Labour critics say the ad doesn't mention Europe or their party . Mr Clegg tried to laugh off the film’s efforts to ridicule him. He said: ‘They spent money on this? Particularly from Ed Miliband who is the sort of missing man in British politics. ‘He hasn’t breathed a word about the issue we’re supposed to be debating, which is whether we’re in or out of Europe.’","New US-style attack advert produced by Labour party for Euro elections .

"By . Jason Groves . and Becky Barrow . Ed Miliband insists that his new plan will not lead to the reintroduction of full-blown rent controls . Ed Miliband’s flagship plan to impose 1970s-style rent controls was unravelling last night hours after it was launched. The Labour leader attempted to open a new front in his war on the ‘cost of living crisis’ by pledging to cap rent rises in the private sector. He said landlords would be forced to offer three-year tenancy agreements,  with only modest rent increases permitted each year. Labour said the move would help the nine million who rent in the UK and suggested it was backed by the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Sources said the RICS would help Labour establish a ‘benchmark’ for capping annual rent rises. But, in an embarrassing setback, the RICS immediately distanced itself from the idea, saying: ‘Arbitrary caps are not a solution.’ It added: ‘RICS is not developing proposals on rent benchmarks for the private sector, and we do not recommend that a government introduce a ceiling on rent increases.’ In a further blow it emerged that hundreds of thousands of properties owned by buy-to-let investors could be excluded from the plans. David Hollingworth, from independent mortgage broker London & Country, said the vast majority of buy-to-let mortgages specify maximum tenancy agreements of one year. Labour sources confirmed that these landlords would be permitted to offer short tenancies  ‘where they are contractually obliged to do so’. Mr Miliband said he wants to stop estate agents from charging tenants  up front fees of up to £500 before moving into a property . Mr Miliband insisted that his plans do not amount to the reintroduction of full-blown rent controls, which have been widely discredited. He said at the launch of Labour’s local and European election campaign in Essex that the needs of the growing numbers in rented accommodation had been ‘ignored for too long’. Mr Miliband has suffered a significant setback in his plan to control rents . Labour also plans to ban letting agents from charging tenants upfront signing on fees of  up to £500. The rental . clampdown was the centre-piece in a new ten-point ‘cost of living . contract’ with voters. But industry groups and housing experts warned . that rent controls inevitably led to a reduction in the supply of good . quality rented accommodation in the long term. Chris . Town, of the Residential Landlords Association, pointed out that . official figures show private sector rents rose by an average of just 1 . per cent last year. He . added: ‘All the evidence clearly shows that rent controls of the kind . being proposed would critically undermine investment in new homes to . rent.’ Sam . Bowman, of the free market Adam Smith Institute, described Mr . Miliband’s move as ‘one of the worst policy decisions in the history of . modern British politics’. He . added: ‘Labour has unwittingly announced a policy that would devastate . Britain’s cities by creating massive slums and exacerbate the housing . crisis.’ Ed Miliband, right, organised a campaign against increasing rents during his first year at Oxford back in 1989 .

"By . Emma Innes . A teenager who was terrified of becoming ‘a hunchback’ because of her misshapen spine has achieved her dream of becoming a model. Leanne Roberts, 18, suffers from severe scoliosis which makes her spine curved. The schoolgirl would spend hours in front of a mirror attempting to improve her posture. Scroll down for video . Leanne Roberts, 18, has scoliosis which causes her spine to bend in an S-shape. It caused her severe pain when she moved and she feared she would end up in a wheelchair . When she was diagnosed with the condition at 16, doctors told her she would need a 12-hour operation and she feared it would end her dreams of becoming a successful model. Scoliosis causes the spine to . excessively curve sideways. The condition affects around four per cent . of the population and if left untreated it can lead to fatal heart and . lung problems. Current . treatment techniques centre on having major operations, which are risky . procedures involving metal rods being inserted either side of the spine. Doctors told Leanne that she would need a risky 12-hour operation to correct the curvature in her spine (pictured) but she refused to have the surgery as she thought it would end her chances of being a model . Instead, she turned to a non-surgical treatment to improve her condition, and has stunned medics with her remarkable progress. Leanne of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, . said: ‘It was awful how much time I would spend crying and I was . terrified of what would happen to me when I was first diagnosed. ‘I was paranoid I would end up looking awful and would end up in a wheelchair.’ Leanne, who often modelled in fashion catalogues, has a double S-shaped curved spine. Leanne has now found relief from the pain in her back by doing exercises to strengthen the muscles around her spine . She first noticed aching pains when she was 14, but put them down to growing pains. It . was only when she started to suffer agonising sharp pains during photo . shoots that she mentioned it to her mother and went to see her GP. She was told by a consultant she would need surgery but instead discovered a clinic called Scoliosis SOS on the internet. The idea is that various exercises can strengthen the muscles surrounding the spine, stabilising the condition. Leanne said: ‘I was ecstatic and I . couldn’t wait to start the treatment. I think everyone should consider . exercise before putting themselves through a risky operation. ‘I could feel the difference in my back after the first few days, and I could see the difference. ‘As long as I keep up with the exercises I shouldn’t suffer from pain and my scoliosis should stabilise. I feel like I am back in control again.’ 'I lost interest in everything and I had no quality of life at all. I had gone from being really confident in my body to wanting to hide away at every opportunity. As long as I keep up with the exercises I shouldn’t suffer from pain and my scoliosis should stabilise. I feel like I am back in control again' - Leanne Roberts . The condition is likely to get worse, but Leanne has thrown herself back into modelling regardless. She said: ‘I am so happy now - it's remarkable how far I have come. I was in constant pain on a daily basis and my whole world had fallen apart. ‘I lost interest in everything and I had no quality of life at all. I had gone from being really confident in my body to wanting to hide away at every opportunity. ‘I feel I can now finally look forward.’ A spokesman for Scoliosis SOS said: ‘Leanne decided our treatment could not do any harm and if it worked it could change her life. ‘Within weeks of being on the course, Leanne’s condition dramatically improved. She was no longer lying awake at night with pain and her confidence soared. ‘Since completing her treatment, Leanne has returned home and has been able to shop and feel confident in her clothes again for the first time in months. ‘She has regained all of her passion for life and has bounced back to her normal, fit and sociable self. She has also re-started her modelling career and is very excited about what the future holds.’ Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape. Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not handing properly and back pain. Pain usually only affects adults with the condition. In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children could of every 1,000. It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis. It is more common in women than in men. Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows. However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing. Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine. In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . When the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis released of a list of priests credibly accused of sexually abusing minors, victims' groups complained it was incomplete. Harry Walsh wasn't on the list of 30 priests made public two weeks ago. But church documents obtained by Minnesota Public Radio show he had been accused in the 1990s of molesting a 15-year-old girl in Detroit in the mid-1960s and a 12-year-old altar boy in South St. Paul in the early 1980s. The archdiocese contributed to a financial settlement for the girl in 1996. Nonetheless, two archbishops allowed him to continue working in parishes until the fall of 2011, MPR reported. Accused: Harry Walsh, 79, is accused of molesting a 15-year-old girl in Detroit in the mid-1960s and a 12-year-old altar boy in South St. Paul, Minnesota, in the early 1980s . Archbishop John Nienstedt asked Pope Benedict last year to defrock Walsh after he learned of the abuse allegations from documents in church archives, as well as an old internal investigation that determined Walsh had an affair with a married parishioner at a church in Monticello. Walsh agreed to leave. Walsh now teaches sex education to troubled teenagers and vulnerable adults in Wright County. He signed a two-year, $1,508-a-month contract this year, according to public records. Claims: Walsh served at Holy Redeemer parish in Detroit from 1965 until 1967. In 1994, a woman reported that Walsh had sexually abused her there when she was a 15-year-old girl . He told the station he never sexually abused children.'I'd have been shocked if I was on the list because there's nothing credible about it,' Walsh told MPR. 'If I were hiding that, you wouldn't be in my house right now; I would have been very careful.' In 1997, Walsh contributed to a book called 'How I Got into Sex', which drew on the experiences of 'sex therapists, educators, prostitutes, sex toy designers, sex surrogates, transsexuals, criminologists and clergy.' In it he described a life of sexual repression, mostly at the boys boarding school he attended. 'Removed from all contact with  ""members of the opposite sex,"" it soon became clear that the one remaining fortress of sexual expression that needed to be conquered and leveled was 'the solitary vice of self-abuse.' He told how, soon after he became a priest, he showed his mother a picture when he was three years old. She was shocked, he wrote. He went on: 'In the name of all the saints in Ireland, what was wrong with the photograph? Mother pointed at my crotch … Following the direction of my mother's extended forefinger, I noticed that the cotton suit was snug enough in the crotch area to reveal a tiny bulge where my three-year-old penis was located. That was Mother's problem.' He wrote that she cut the photo in two and burned the bottom half. 'I stared in disbelief as the disintegrating picture of my young self, consumed, like Joan of Arc, in the flames of orthodoxy,' he wrote. 'I knew, at that point, that my sexual script had been written for me years before. My parents' horoscope read: This one shall be crotchless. This one shall be a priest.' Walsh said he might have kissed the girl affectionately, but it wouldn't have been sexual. He denied the allegation about the boy, who reported it as an adult to the archdiocese in 1996, and said he had never heard of the accusation. Archdiocese spokesman Jim Accurso failed to explain why Walsh wasn't on the public list of accused priests, nor . would he say why Walsh was allowed to serve as a music minister at St. Henry's Catholic Church in Monticello until he retired from that post . two years ago, MPR reported. 'These . disclosures are intended to be ongoing,' the archdiocese said in a . statement. 'We are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of clergy . files and the list will be updated as additional announcements are . made.' Accurso did not immediately return a phone call from the Associated Press seeking comment on Thursday. It . could not be immediately determined if either instance of alleged abuse . was ever reported to police. South St. Paul and Detroit police . officials said records were not immediately available, if they exist. MPR's report said there were no records of archdiocese officials . notifying police about the allegations. Jennifer . Haselberger, a former top adviser to Nienstedt, said the church had a . moral responsibility to disclose Walsh's alleged abuse, particularly . because he now teaches children about sex. No . one told Wright County officials about the allegations, said Carol . Schefers, the county's public health director, who signed Walsh's . contract. She also said she didn't know what she would do with the . information. On Tuesday, . Nienstedt said he has stepped aside from active ministry while police . investigate an allegation that he touched a boy on the buttocks in 2009. The archbishop called the claim 'absolutely and entirely false.'","Harry Walsh, 79, accused of molesting girl in Detroit in 60s and boy in 80s .

The Ukip candidate is a serving MEP . and is also standing for the European Parliament again next week. But . his outspoken views on homosexuality have sparked controversy. He has . previously said homosexuality is ‘not a lifestyle worthy of valid equal . respect’, but now claims that his views have changed. Mr Farage told the BBC’s Sunday . Politics show yesterday that Mr Helmer ‘grew up with a strong Christian . Bible background – he grew up in an age when homosexuality was actually . imprisonable’. He said Mr Helmer was a good candidate who had made his . most outspoken comments on homosexuality while he was a Conservative . MEP. He added: ‘When Roger grew up and, . indeed, when he was an adult, homosexuality was illegal in this country, . and he held that view for some period of time. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage poses for a photograph as he unveils a new UKIP campaign poster for European Elections on May 11 . The Ukip leader was challenged over remarks by prominent MEP Roger Helmer who once said he some people find gay people ¿distasteful if not viscerally repugnant¿ . Mr Farage, who was egged on a visit to Nottingham, complained about having to have security to deal with protests . ‘And actually, if we asked the 70s and over in this country how they felt about it, most of them still feel uncomfortable. ‘He has said the world has moved on, . he now accepts there’s been a big social change in Britain. There are a . lot of people in this country who are disconcerted by the change in the . traditional meaning of marriage, and  I think in a tolerant society we . understand that some people have different views.’ Ukip has faced a deluge of bad publicity about comments made by some of its candidates and leading supporters. Demetri Marchessini, Ukip’s sixth . biggest donor, claimed last month that gay people are incapable of love . and said it was impossible for a man to rape his wife. Harry Perry, a . Ukip council candidate in Stockport, was suspended from the party . earlier this month for branding David Cameron a ‘gay-loving nutcase’. The party has also been forced to discipline a number of candidates for racist remarks. Nigel Farage claims he has been forced to hire bodyguards due to the threat of violence from anti-fascist organisations. The Ukip leader said yesterday that members of the groups Unite Against Fascism and Hope Not Hate have been violently protesting at his public meetings. He said: ‘I’m perfectly happy for them to come to my meetings  and have an argument with me, but it’s not so much fun when they are banging me over the head with banners.’ Both groups denied Mr Farage’s accusations.","Ukip leader says Roger Helmer has a 'strong Christian Bible background'

"By . Helen Lawson . A former Emmerdale actor is being investigated over claims he raped a 13-year-old boy at his home in the early 1970s. The star is said to have lured the boy to his house by promising he would meet famous actors and agents at a party that night. The alleged victim has given statements to detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal, reports the Sunday Mirror. An ex-Emmerdale star is being investigated over claims he raped a 13-year-old boy at his home in the early 1970s . Detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal have taken statements from a man who claims he was sexually assaulted at the actor's home . He is said to have told police that he was on his way to watch an amateur dramatics production in the village where he grew up when the actor pulled up in his car and asked the boy if he knew who he was. The man claims he was handed a £5 note and invited to the party by the actor before getting in to the car with him and driving to a house, according to the newspaper. The alleged victim told officers that he was pinned down by three men there before the actor raped him. He claims he blacked out following the assault and was thrown out of the house naked, before his clothes were thrown after him and he walked home in shock. The man told police that it is the first time he has spoken about the incident and has found relationships difficult since the encounter. The man made the allegations to Operation Yewtree officers investigating Jimmy Savile . A West Yorkshire Police spokesman told the Sunday Mirror: 'We have received an allegation of child sexual ­offences from the 1970s. 'Enquiries are on­going.' The claims against the former Emmerdale actor are the latest allegations against high-profile figures from the entertainment world since Savile's offences were revealed. On Friday, soap star Bill Roache was charged with sexually assaulting four girls, one as young as 11, in the late 1960s. A month before, the Coronation Street actor, who plays Ken Barlow, was charged with twice raping a schoolgirl in 1967. Fellow Coronation Street star Michael . Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air . after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including . rape, indecent assault and sexual activity. He denies the charges, which are not linked to Roache. This week, former Radio 1 DJ Chris . Denning was arrested and bailed by Savile detectives on suspicion of . 'historic allegations' of sexual offences. It is understood he is not accused of any offences with Savile, a former colleague. Last . month, the Mail revealed that comedian Jim Davidson is being . investigated by Operation Yewtree officers over claims he indecently . assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s during a concert . tour. The attack is alleged . to have happened while the former Generation Game host was entertaining . British troops stationed there after the Falklands conflict. Coronation Street actors Michael Le Vell, left, and Bill Roache, right, have been charged with child sex offences .

"By . Jason Groves . Tony Blair will launch a staunch defence of the European Union today, amid growing speculation he is planning a fresh bid to become president of Europe. The former Prime Minister will use a speech to the CBI in London to underline his pro-EU credentials, and make the case for Britain’s deeper involvement in Europe. The intervention comes just days after he held private talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about how to tackle the growing tide of Euroscepticism across Europe. 'Antidote to Farage': Former Prime Minister Tony Blair will use a speech to the Confederation of British Industry in London to underline his pro-EU credentials, and make the case for Britain¿s deeper involvement in Europe . Mr Blair is said to have offered to tour Europe and the world persuading people that ‘being in the EU is good for you’, despite the dismal economic performance of the Eurozone. His offer was seen as a fresh drive to win a top job in Europe. In 2009, Mr Blair lost out to the little known former Belgian prime minister Herman van Rompuy in the race to become the first President of the European Council – the group of EU leaders that has the final say on key decisions. His bid was reportedly blocked by Mrs Merkel, who believed his Iraq War legacy was too toxic, and feared that he would use the role as a platform to outshine the EU leaders he was supposed to represent.

Mr Blair’s office issued a denial at the weekend, saying: ‘Tony Blair is not seeking any role, has not discussed any role and doesn’t want any role.’ But despite the denial, some Brussels observers believe he is looking to make a return to European politics – possibly in a specially-created role.

"By . Mark Prigg . The future of year-round farming could lie not in farms, but in huge warehouses lit with an eerie pink light, researchers have claimed. Researchers have found that tomatoes grown around LED lights in the winter can significantly reduce greenhouse energy costs without sacrificing yield - and say the technique could change the way farming works. One US firm is already experimenting with a giant warehouse in Texas, which hides a vast hi-tech pink growing area where 2.2 million plants will only see sunlight at the end of their life. A giant 'pinkhouse' at Caliber Biotherapeutics in Bryan, Texas, which grows 2.2 million plants under the glow of blue and red LEDs - and could become the future of urban farming . The giant warehouse which houses the 'undercover farm' The 'pink' lights  give plants only the wavelengths of light they need the most - blue and red. Plant's photosynthesis machinery is tuned to absorb red and blue light most efficiently, so the researchers have developed systems to only supply this wavelength, lowering the cost of lighting systems needed. The systems allow plants to grow perfectly normally without the need for real sunlight. Caliber Biotherapeutics, a Texas firm, is already growing a tobacco-like plant to make new drugs and vaccines using the system. The 150,000-square-foot . 'plant factory' is completely closed off from the outside world, and . is home to 2.2 million plants, stacked 50 feet high under the glow of . blue and red LEDS. 'A photon is a terrible thing to waste,' Holtz told NPR. 'So we developed these lights to correctly match the photosynthesis needs of our plants. 'We get almost 20 percent faster growth rate and save a lot energy.' Researchers at Purdue University say the technique could be used for producing crops all year-round. Cary Mitchell, a professor of horticulture, said the average tomato is shipped about 1,500 miles from warmer climates where they are grown to cooler climates that cannot produce the fruit cost-effectively in the winter. He believes that LED lights could mean growing all year round - and help local farmers compete. 'The United States still imports one-third of its tomatoes from Mexico and Canada, as well as other countries,' Mitchell said. 'It makes it really hard for the . greenhouse industry to grow tomatoes well in the offseason. Cary Mitchell, from left, and Celina Gomez harvest tomatoes grown around red and blue LED lights, which use far less energy than traditional high-pressure sodium lamps in greenhouses . 'We're trying . to change that and make it affordable,' Mitchell said. 'This technology could allow U.S. growers to create local jobs that shrink carbon footprints and produce . better-tasting tomatoes.' Mitchell and doctoral student . Celina Gómez experimented with light-emitting diodes, which are cooler . and require far less energy than traditional high-pressure sodium lamps . used in greenhouses. They got the same yield - size and . number of fruit - with high-pressure sodium lamps and LED towers, but . the LEDs used about 25 percent of the energy of traditional lamps.The . scientists think that the method could have other advantages because . the cooler LEDs can be placed much closer and along the sides of plants, . lighting not only the top, but also the underside. Future studies include comparing LED-lit tomatoes with traditionally grown tomatoes for flavor. Crops could soon be grown in greenhouses the size of skyscrapers in city centres across the country, it has been claimed. Birds Eye and other food producers are investigating building ‘plantscrapers’, which could accommodate hundreds of storeys worth of crops, in a bid to make farming more economical, sustainable and meet increasing demand. The ‘vertical farms’ would use an innovative feeding system which nourishes plants with enriched water, therefore cancelling out the need for soil – and the need for food to be grown  and harvested in the countryside. How the 'plantscraper' works . Because the climate inside them can be controlled, it is claimed the farms will  dramatically increase crop yields because growing can occur all year round, while the plants would be under cover, so pesticides would not need to be used. Some supermarket foods such as tomatoes and strawberries are already grown on farms using a primitive form of the so-called hydroponic system. Now there are sophisticated plantscrapers planned or under construction in Sweden, Japan, China, Singapore and Chicago in the U.S. In Linkoping, Sweden, a 54-metre-high structure (just over half the height of Elizabeth Tower – home of Big Ben – in London) is being built by Swedish firm Plantagon. By 2014, the structure will produce a range of leafy green vegetables, including salad leaves, spinach and mustard greens.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . For years it had remained shut off from the rest of world and shrouded in mystery. But this unique collection of images taken 100 years ago are some of the first ever insights in to rural Japan before it was opened up to the rest of the globe. The collection of pictures - the first ever used to promote tourism in the country - show geishas relaxing in pleasure gardens while workers pick tea leaves from the fields. Memoirs of a Geisha: Geishas enjoy a summer's day in a landscaped garden in this 100-year-old photo by Tamamura Kozaburo . Unique insight: The rare collection of images show Japan just before its industrial revolution . The world's secret garden: The collection of 100-year-old photos were . taken to try to attract tourists to the country at the beginning of the . 20th century after the lifting of the bamboo curtain . Mysterious: Japan remained cut off from much of the world until the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854 . Iconic landmarks such as the Kintai-kyo bridge, built in 1673, and the Great Buddha of Kamakura, first constructed in 1252, appear much the same at the beginning of the 20th Century as they do today. But while the monuments themselves may look unchanged, the surroundings are now packed with tourists and often surrounded by skyscrapers to house the ever-growing population which has more than doubled from 49,852,000 in 1910 to 128,056,026 in 2010. The photos were taken by Tamamura Kozaburo to try to attract tourists to Japan after the country opened up to the rest of the world following the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. The convention opened the Japanese ports . of Shimoda and Hakodate to U.S. trade for the first time in 200 years and ensured the safety of . shipwrecked American sailors. But before the convention, Japan had cut . itself off from the rest of the world for more than two centuries and was . lagging behind in new technologies. Landmarks: The Imperial Palace, the main residence of the Emperor of Japan, was completely isolated 100 years ago . The past and the present: The Imperial Palace is now surrounded by modern skyscrapers in Tokyo . A bygone era: A lone fisherman is captured coming in to shore . Water under the bridge: The Kintai-kyo bridge, built in 1673, still stands today . Spot the difference: Today the Kintai-kyo bridge is lit up at night and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Japan . It was only when Commodore Matthew Perry of the United States Navy steamed into the bay in Yokohama with four warships - the Mississippi, Plymouth, Saratoga, and Susquehanna - in 1853 that the channels of communication were forced open. This eventually lead to the Convention agreement the following year. Japan soon undertook drastic political, economic, and cultural transformations to emerge as a unified and centralised state to try to put itself on an even keel with the West. It's industrial revolution began around 1870 as national leaders hoped to catch up with the West by building railway lines, better roads, and invested heavily in modern industry such as textiles, including cotton and silk. By 1910, Japan had come out triumphant in a war with Russia and become the first Eastern modern imperial power. It was around this time that this collection of photos were taken to show off Japan to the outside world, which had previously been rigidly introverted and anti any foreign or outside influence. Photographer Kozaburo was the first to produce tourist shots for Japan with an album of 51 collotype  black and white photographic prints, which were painstakingly inked in by a team of 100 colourists, and gave Europe one of its first glimpses of life inside the previously secretive state. Out at sea: A few fishing smacks are seen off the Japanese coast which later became an international port . Rural village: The black and white images taken by Kozaburo were painstakingly inked in by a team of 100 colourists . Country retreat: The Japanese are still renowned for their beautiful gardens 100 years on . These photos show Japan at a prosperous time, when it was starting to build itself into a dominating world power during a period of rapid economic growth and on the cusp of significant technological advancement. But as Japan began to catch up with the rest of the world powers, it began to exert its brutal power by declaring war on surrounding countries such as China. This provoked condemnation from the West and tensions with America began to further escalate over its control of Japan's oil resources, eventually leading to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour and entry in to World War II. But these . hand-coloured prints show untouched Japan before its disastrous losses in World War II forced the country to surrender. They  are mounted in . an oblong folio within its original box and are expected to fetch £800 . at auction through Woolley and Wallis auctioneers of Salisbury, . Wiltshire. Clare Durham, Asian art expert at Woolley and Wallis, said: 'Japan had been closed off until the 1860s so it was still relatively new to Europeans. 'The photos were taken at a time when everything Japanese was of great interest to people in Europe and at a time when photography was in its infancy. 'They offer a fascinating look at the geisha culture at this time. It is a really interesting historical snapshot of Japan and its cities 100 years ago. 'It has come to us from a person in the south west who has had the album for a while now. Classic Japanese temple: A Buddhist shrine set alone in the mountains .

"By . James Chapman . and Daniel Martin . and Jack Doyle . Time to get tough: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha Cameron . Senior Tories say David Cameron should commit to backing an exit from the EU if he fails to negotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship with Brussels. Voters may not be convinced by his pledge of an in/out referendum by 2017 unless he toughens his stance, they say. After Nigel Farage's advances in local and European elections, MPs also say victory in next week's by-election in Newark is vital to burst the Ukip bubble. Mr Cameron said the message from voters had been 'absolutely received and understood'. He said: 'People are deeply  disillusioned with the European Union, they don't feel that the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain. 'What we need to do is demonstrate we are the ones with the plan to sort out this relationship and give people the choice – in or out.' The Tories' Euro election results were not as bad as feared, however. Many were taken aback to find their party came close to beating Labour into second place in polls voters often use to punish governing parties. In some regions, such as the South West, the Conservative vote was almost the same as in 2009, at the height of Gordon Brown's unpopularity. However, the figures suggest the party will struggle to gain a majority at a general election even if it is the largest single group – raising the prospect of another coalition. A source close to the 1922 Committee of Backbench Tories said: 'There's no need for seismic change. But the problem is these results confirm where we thought we were: cruising for a messy result next year. 'Obviously holding Newark is important, but the big message from the results is about the lack of trust in politics... Do people really believe there is actually going to be a referendum?' Tory MP Mark Field said an outright win was a 'tall order', and Cameron's pledge to hold an in/out referendum on Europe had not 'shot the [Ukip] fox'. 'Ukip present themselves as a party that wants to break down compromises they see in... the Westminster village,' he said. 'The truth is there's more to choose between the Conservatives and Labour than there has been in the last 25 years.' Scroll down for videos . More of the same? Figures suggest the Tories will struggle to gain a majority at a general election even if it is the largest single group ¿ raising the prospect of another coalition . Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said: 'Tory MPs may have agreed not to panic in the light of Ukip's big win, but that doesn't mean David Cameron isn't going to come under a huge amount of pressure from them.' They will demand he brings forward the referendum and sets out his plans for renegotiating relations with the EU, he said. Senior Tories, such as business minister Michael Fallon, urged Mr Cameron to say he would back leaving the EU if he could not arrange a favourable deal. Worryingly for Conservatives, the European results put Ukip ahead in some parts of Newark, site of next Thursday's by-election triggered by the resignation of disgraced MP Patrick Mercer. Mr Cameron has already made two campaign visits to the area. One Tory MP said a failure to listen to voters could cost them the seat. Seismic: Ukip's Jonathan Arnott celebrating after being elected as a MEP on Sunday . He added: 'Everyone says they've heard the voters' anger... but then the usual  cliche-laden, soft-Left social democratic politics carries on as before. I'm not sure that's going to win it for us in Newark.'  Tory Peter Bone said he was 'confident' of victory, but called for a deal with Ukip. He said: 'Personally, I'd take Cameron and Farage and lock them in a room, and not let them out until they've reached an agreement.' The Prime Minister rejected calls to back an EU exit, saying other member countries are also keen on reform. 'I am confident of a good renegotiation,' he said. He said he will not countenance 'pacts or deals' with Ukip. 'Conservative candidates will stand as Conservatives, fight as Conservatives and I hope win as Conservatives,' he added. Francois Hollande, the French president, and a champion of the EU, said that the EU must reform and scale back. He said the EU had become too 'remote and incomprehensible'. 'Europe has to be simple, clear, to be effective where it is needed and to withdraw from where it is not necessary,' he said. By Simon Heffer . UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage poses for photographers at a pub ahead of a press conference in central London yesterday . Even after the Conservative Party’s most humiliating performance in a national election since 1906, David Cameron was still in denial yesterday about why he and the Tories are so unpopular. Although he said he accepts that ‘people are deeply disillusioned with the EU’, none of the other messages that great swathes of Middle Britain sent to the Government — and indeed Labour — by voting so heavily for Ukip have been understood. Certainly people are cheesed off with the anti-democratic, elitist and corrupt Leviathan that the EU has become. But they are also angry and frustrated that Mr Cameron has, for many years, mostly responded to such demands with talk rather than action. While he has outlined plans to restrict immigration and to limit access by new immigrants to welfare benefits and public services, the problem becomes worse daily. While the Prime Minister and his colleagues have indulged in rhetoric, tens of thousands of people from Eastern Europe have poured into Britain — leaving our own citizens with the feeling that the Government couldn’t care less about their prosperity, their aspirations and their investment in the country. This is compounded by the fact that Mr Cameron seems unable to understand — or refuses to admit — that Ukip also champions policies that voters once found in the older, establishment parties but which the Oxbridge-educated, metropolitan elite who now run them find unpalatable. Between them, Ukip and the Tories got nearly 52 per cent of the vote in the European elections, confirming that there is a right-of-centre majority in this country. Mr Cameron’s dilemma is how to unite these conservative forces and prevent Ed Miliband becoming prime minister next year by default. While this seems to be a challenge that is being ducked by leading Tories such as William Hague, who parroted the line that the Tory party doesn’t do pacts, in fact it has had to in the past and can do again. A number of MPs and MEPs — led by Daniel Hannan and including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Douglas Carswell and Peter Bone — have said publicly that the Tories and Ukip must come to an accommodation. Principles are one thing: but the point of being in politics is to have power, and power is haemorrhaging away from the Tories otherwise. Compromise: A number of MPs and MEPs ¿ led by Daniel Hannan and including Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured), Douglas Carswell and Peter Bone ¿ have said publicly that the Tories and Ukip must come to an accommodation. Although no member of the Cabinet is prepared to countenance such a possibility yet, some junior ministers (as well as numerous backbench Tory MPs worried about losing their seats next year) would find it easy to strike some deal with Ukip. Despite Mr Cameron’s antipathy, it would be straightforward for Tory parliamentary candidates to be allowed to begin discussions with Ukip at a local level. It is highly unlikely that a sitting MP is going to give up his seat for a Ukip candidate. However, in constituencies such as Thanet South, in Kent, where Nigel Farage has been tipped to stand and the incumbent Tory MP is standing down, there is nothing to be gained by putting up a novice Tory candidate against him when he could quite likely win the seat without having his vote split by the Tory. There will be other seats where Tories might choose not to field a candidate and where Ukip is strong. In return, Ukip could decide not to fight seats where a Tory incumbent stands the best chance of defeating Labour. Similar deals were made when Winston Churchill’s Tories formed an alliance with the National Liberals in 1951. In any case, many Ukip activists used to be Tory activists. Negotiations ought not to prove difficult. For his part, Nigel Farage has always been open-minded about a deal, though reluctant to do one with Mr Cameron because of the toxic image the PM has among most Ukip supporters. I suspect he might feel able to change his party’s mind on that if there were advantages for Ukip, such as posts for his team in a Tory/Ukip government. Ukip would hope to see some movement within the Tory party on policies other than Europe, notably on public spending and education. But there are many Tory MPs, too, who wish their leadership would ditch its opposition to grammar schools and its £10 billion-a-year overseas aid programme. Ukip has a clear idea of where it can win seats. It will shortly embark on a fundraising drive to help its general election campaign and it hopes this week’s success will bring money flooding in, as well as attracting new activists. If the Tories have any sense, they will start talking about such an arrangement now. For if, next week, Ukip wins the Newark by-election and the Tories descend into panic, David Cameron might find himself with no other option.","Voters may not be swayed by in/out referendum promise, say senior Tories .
Conservatives need a victory in Newark by-election to halt Ukip advance .

A third of cereal is eaten for meals other than breakfast, only five per cent of Americans have three square meals a day and Dunkin’ Donuts is shifting masses of chicken salad sandwiches before 9am. The U.S. food industry is adapting to huge changes in the eating habits of Americans, with two in five snacking more than once every day and several thousand McDonald’s opening for 24 hours a day. One in five of all cookies and apple pies sold by the fast food chain are at breakfast and other food outlets are launching innovative ideas such as French toast ice cream and the Maple Bacon sundae. Changing trends: Kellogg’s is targeting Special K Chocolatey Delight cereals as a snack for after dinner and Dunkin’ Donuts is shifting masses of chicken salad sandwiches before 9am . ‘I don't think my kids have eaten a real meal since last Thanksgiving,’ Stan Frankenthaler, of Dunkin' Brands - which owns fast food chain Dunkin' and ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins - told USA Today. The University of California, Berkeley, is finding less than three in 10 students are on its 'all-you-can-eat' meal plan, which is around half the proportion just a decade ago, reported the newspaper. ‘Eating weird is the new normal,’ Shawn LaPean, of the college’s Cal Dining service, said. ‘If students eat any square meals per day it might be one. The rest is filled with snacks and food on the go.’ 'Eating weird is the new normal. If students eat any square meals per day, it might be one. The rest is filled with snacks and food on the go' Shawn LaPean . The three biggest trends USA Today found is that Americans are eating what they want when they want, skip meals without a second thought and want food tailor-made to their exact preferences. McDonald’s, a chain synonymous with American over-indulgence but also product innovation, is launching a popcorn-size chicken snack called McBites next year after a trial in Washington D.C. Its restaurants are finding one in five customers buy their cookies and apple pies for breakfast and more than 20 per cent of their oatmeal portions are sold at meal times other than breakfast.

Meanwhile Kellogg’s is targeting Special K Chocolatey Delight and Rice Krispies cereals as snacks for after dinner, and Stonyfield is finding 20 per cent of buyers eat yoghurt in place of an evening meal. Trends expert Nancy Kruse told USA Today deserts are often eaten before breakfast, lunch and dinner are being merged into ‘linner’ and breakfast and dinner are coming together for ‘brinner’. USA Today picked the case study of . California student Ashwin Aravind, 20, who eats a muffin and Tater Tots . for breakfast at 10am, a rice bowl at 2pm and McDonald’s cookies with . fries at 3pm. He will not eat dinner until 11pm when he has pizza and a bowl of rice later. ‘Most of my friends skip breakfast altogether,’ he told USA Today. The investigation into odd eating habits will prompt accusations this is encouraging the U.S. obesity problem. A study in August found 15 per cent of households say they cannot afford nutritious food. One in four people in 36 states are seriously overweight. In stark contrast, no state had an obesity rate above 25 per cent in 2000.

"By . Laura Clark . Teacher yesterday backed a major escalation of strike action which could close thousands of schools during the summer term. Chanting ‘Gove must go’, activists from the National Union of Teachers – the most militant classroom union – voted overwhelmingly for a national strike unless ministers agree to a series of demands on pensions and automatic pay rises. Delegates at the NUT’s annual conference in Brighton passed an emergency motion which demanded strike action in the week beginning June 23 unless ‘significant’ progress is made in resolving the long-running dispute with the Government. Exams: The National Union of Teachers has vowed to step up their campaign of industrial action, starting with a week in June when at least 12 GCSE or A-level exams are scheduled (Stock photo) The summer strikes will overlap with  the end of the exam season, although the union insisted its intention is not to disrupt tests. Staff would be able to cross picket lines in the event of a clash with an exam, the NUT said. Last month a national strike forced the closure of 3,000 schools and pushed thousands more on to reduced timetables. Conference delegates also raised the prospect of a series of walkouts during the autumn term and in 2015 as they step up their campaign against government reforms. Proposing the motion, the NUT’s treasurer, Ian Murch, branded Education Secretary Michael Gove a ‘demented Dalek on speed’. The campaign is mainly aimed at derailing the introduction of performance-related pay and changes to pension rules, and tackling ‘excessive’ workloads. 'Must go': Delegates chanted 'Gove must go' at the end of the annual NUT conference, held today in Brighton, in reference to Education Secretary Michael Gove . The new system of performance-related pay, due to be introduced in September, would bring automatic pay rises to an end, with schools given the flexibility to offer higher salaries to their best teachers. Under the old system teachers were previously virtually guaranteed £2,000 annual rises. But under the new system salary rises will be linked to annual appraisals instead of length  of service. Teachers will be expected to show they have achieved good results with their pupils and kept order in the classroom. But the NUT claims the new system is ‘unfair’ and will lead to pay cuts for many because of budget constraints. Changes to pensions would make them less generous and mean teachers retiring later. The strike resolution was backed by a large majority of delegates at the conference yesterday but was not passed unanimously. Afterwards, delegates stood up cheering and chanting: ‘Gove must go.’ The motion leaves ‘flexibility’ for any summer walkout to be longer than a day, although a one-day strike was thought to be the most likely scenario. About one in eight schools in England was forced to close fully when the NUT staged a one-day walkout last month, according to government estimates, although it is thought that many more were partially shut. The NASUWT, the other big teaching union, also left open the possibility of a strike at its conference in Birmingham but did not set a date. If it joined with the NUT, thousands more schools would be affected. At least a dozen GCSE and  A-level papers are scheduled for the first two days of the week proposed in the NUT’s resolution, with one advanced maths extension paper scheduled for the Wednesday of that week. NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: ‘Strike action will not disrupt exams. If necessary, exemptions can be given to staff who are needed to supervise an exam, but the NUT is looking to take action at the end of the main exam season.’ But Miss Blower admitted that a June strike would could cause disruption. ‘Of course parents will say this is inconvenient, it is inconvenient,’ she said. ‘It’s actually in the nature of industrial action that you do it because you want to cause inconvenience because you’re trying to bring your grievances to people’s attention.’ In a controversial speech, Mr Murch described Mr Gove as ‘a parody of an Education Secretary’. He continued: ‘Michael Gove, the man with a mad idea for every occasion. ‘Michael Gove, the demented Dalek on speed who wants to exterminate anything good in education that’s come along since the 1950s. Michael Gove, the man who says he wants to set schools free and then sends in the Spanish inquisition.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Ministers have met frequently with the NUT and other unions and will continue to do so. ‘Further strike action will only disrupt parents’ lives, hold back children’s education and damage the reputation of the profession. ‘We know that the vast majority of our teachers and school leaders are hard-working and dedicated professionals. ‘That is why we are giving teachers more freedoms than ever and cutting unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy.'","National Union of Teachers vows to step up industrial action if 'significant' progress is not made in long-running dispute .

Louis van Gaal wants Manchester United executive chairman Ed Woodward to sign German stars Mats Hummels, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller while he oversees Holland’s World Cup campaign. The incoming United manager is now focused on Holland — but is expecting United to act decisively over the next few weeks, with the club also closing in on Southampton left-back Luke Shaw. All three moves are fraught with problems, with Borussia Dortmund unwilling to sell Hummels, while Muller, who also interests Barcelona, and Schweinstiger will be difficult to prise from Bayern Munich due to their long contracts. The total spend on the Germans is likely to top £100million. Forward planning: Louis van Gaal wants Manchester United to work on transfer deals while he leads Holland at the World Cup in Brazil . Targets: Bayern Munich's Bastian Schweinsteiger (left) and Thomas Muller (right) are wanted by Van Gaal . On the move? Borussia Dortmund will be reluctant to let star defender Mats Hummels leave . Muller, 24, has felt marginalised by new manager Pep Guardiola and is seeking reassurances from Bayern that he remains a key player, while Schweinsteiger, 29, is open to the idea of joining United. Both played under Van Gaal at Bayern in the team that won the double and reached the Champions League final in 2010. Van Gaal converted Schweinsteiger from an attacking wide player into a holding midfielder, then he plucked Muller from Bayern’s youth squad and made him a mainstay of his team. Both players have enormous respect for the Dutch coach and would be happy to move to United if they feel their careers are stalling under Guardiola. Muller’s Bayern experience could be replicated at United by Tom Lawrence, James Wilson and Michael Keane with Van Gaal giving his assistant Ryan Giggs responsibility for creating a production line of youngsters into the first team. Key role: Van Gaal wants assistant manager Ryan Giggs to oversee young players graduating into the first team . Focused: Van Gaal in concentrating on achieving World Cup success with Holland in Brazil . Ever since his Ajax days, Van Gaal has promoted young players and gave Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Victor Valdes their Barcelona debuts. With Giggs having such detailed knowledge of United and the club’s younger players, Van Gaal wants him to make sure the first-team squad is populated with a high proportion of  home-grown stars. Giggs gave Lawrence and Wilson Premier League debuts as stand-in manager at the end of last season and put Keane on the bench against Hull.","Van Gaal wants Ed Woodward to work on deals while he leads Holland at the World Cup .

"By . Laura Clark . Teachers at a Bradford comprehensive were suspended after clashing with governors who wanted to model the school on the academy at the centre of the ‘Trojan Horse’ allegations. Staff at Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College are said to have objected to paying Tahir Alam to provide training to governors. Mr Alam is chairman of governors at Park View Academy – one of five Birmingham schools placed in  special measures by Ofsted this week for failing to protect pupils from extremism. Clash with governors: Laisterdyke Business College in Bradford . He has been accused of being the ‘ringleader’ of an alleged plot to oust head teachers and force through a strict Islamic agenda. After visiting a series of schools in Birmingham, Ofsted is now widening its probe to other areas including Bradford, Luton and east London. At Laisterdyke, where pupils are mainly Muslim, it is claimed governors have attempted to oust principal Jennifer McIntosh. ‘Over recent months there have been ongoing battles between the governors and Jennifer McIntosh which I have witnessed first-hand,’ an anonymous source at the school is reported saying. ‘The tactics used at the school are reminiscent of those employed in Operation Trojan Horse, with governors constantly questioning decisions, school results and vociferous complaints from the community.’ Pupils: Students at Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College, Bradford. It is claimed governors have attempted to oust principle Jennifer McIntosh at the institution . Faisal Khan, a former governor at Laisterdyke, told the Independent newspaper that some members of staff at Laisterdyke were suspended during his time there for ‘ignoring instructions from governors’. Mr Khan also said Mr Alam was paid to carry out governance training at the school and denied that there had been any dispute between the school leadership and governors over payment for the work. Mr Khan insisted: ‘We [the governing body] were all removed for trying to hold the school to account.’  Mr Khan has been filmed describing how he and fellow governors worked ‘for a number of years’ to ‘change the head teacher’ at Bradford schools. He has described claims against him as a ‘witch-hunt’. He and the rest of the governors were removed in April following a critical Ofsted report and concerns raised by the council. They were accused of undermining the head and interfering in the day-to-day running of the school. Park View Academy in Birmingham is one of the five schools put in special measures following an Ofsted report . Ofsted has also visited a second school in the city, Feversham  College, a state Muslim faith school for girls. At a third, Carlton Bolling College, leaked minutes of governors meetings suggest attempts to segregate boys and girls and narrow the curriculum. Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, has asked Ofsted’s regional directors across the country to ‘respond swiftly to further concerns that are brought to their attention’. ‘What inspectors found in a number of schools in Birmingham is deeply disturbing,’ he said. ‘We should all be concerned if a school is failing to encourage children to develop tolerant attitudes towards other faiths and cultures or allowing governors to exert inappropriate influence on the curriculum or other aspects of school life.’","Staff at Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College suspended .

"By . James Slack . Acting dynasty: Star of Dambusters and 1984 Sir Michael Redgrave, and daughter Vanessa . MI5 kept a file on Sir Michael Redgrave – the star of Dambusters and 1984 – for 20 years on suspicion he was a Communist. The internationally-acclaimed British actor also came to the attention of Special Branch 21 times between 1940 and 1949 and sparked great excitement among security officials when meeting notorious traitor Guy Burgess in Moscow. Burgess, secret files reveal today, got drunk and was sick in Sir Michael’s dressing room during a production of a Shakespeare play. Sir Michael – the father of actors Vanessa, Corin and Lynn – first came to the Security Service’s attention in 1940 when he signed the manifesto of the Communist-inspired People’s Vigilance Committee. Sir Michael and his wife, Rachel Kempson, were both involved in the Unity Theatre Communist Group and by 1944 he was a leading member of the Actors Group of the Communist Party. The declassified documents reveal how a Mr Jardine Brown, from the BBC, wrote to MI5 asking for advice on whether it was safe to use Sir Michael for broadcasting. MI5 said that while the actor had ‘made a fool of himself’, it had no objection to his continued employment. Classic movie: Sir Michael (right) made Dambusters, where he played Barnes Wallis, the inventor of the bouncing bomb. He is pictured in this scene from the 1955 film with Richard Todd . Sir Michael went on to make Dambusters, where he played Barnes Wallis, the inventor of the bouncing bomb. The most illuminating section of his file – which runs to more than 100 pages – details a trip to Moscow in 1958/59 for a production of Hamlet. There he met Burgess, one of the Cambridge Five spy ring who had fled Britain seven years earlier with Soviet double agent Donald Maclean after passing Western intelligence to the Russians. It did not get off to a good start, with the louche, flamboyantly homosexual Burgess turning up drunk at the theatre. Watched: Sir Michael Redgrave sparked great excitement among security officials when meeting notorious traitor Guy Burgess in Moscow (pictured) British ambassador Sir Patrick Reilly . reported to MI5: ‘After one of the performances Burgess made his way to . Redgrave’s dressing room and there was sick.’ Nevertheless, . Sir Michael agreed to visit Burgess for lunch in his flat – which had . been provided by the KGB following his defection – much to Sir Patrick’s . chagrin. Burgess, writing to his mother in London – in a letter . intercepted by MI5 – said the pair had had ‘fine gossips’. And he gushed about Sir Michael’s acting, writing: ‘I have never seen such a reception as Michael’s Hamlet got on its last night. It’s certainly the best  Hamlet I’ve ever seen.’ MI5, keen to find out more about Burgess’s life in Moscow, used an old friend of Sir Michael to find out what was discussed by the pair. Probed: The National Archives files reveal that other actors, musicians and literary figures were investigated by MI5 as possible Communists in the post-war years - including J B Priestley (left) and Benjamin Britten (right) Much of what Burgess was said to have told the actor they already knew, but MI5’s source was intrigued by one remark by Burgess that ‘I did all that was required of me by bringing Maclean safe to Russia’. Sir Michael later confirmed Burgess had not wanted to defect – believing his own role was simply to get Maclean safely out of the country – and that he had been duped by his KGB handlers. The National Archives files reveal that other actors, musicians and literary figures were investigated by MI5 as possible Communists in the post-war years. They included J B Priestley, Benjamin Britten and his lover Peter Pears. All were considered to have Left-wing sympathies but were not rated threats to national security.","Actor came to attention of Special Branch 21 times from 1940 to 1949 .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A woman police sergeant was found hanged today by stunned colleagues who had been searching for her since she vanished four days ago. Sgt Louise Gibson, 43, had been at the centre of a huge manhunt by police, who discovered her body around 4pm. The married mother-of-three originally from Macclesfield, who served with Thames Valley Police Force for more than 10 years, has not been seen since 5.30pm on Thursday, when she left her parents’ house in Buckinghamshire. Tragic: The body of WPS Louise Gibson, 43, was found dead today, four days after going missing from her parents' home in Buckinghamshire . ACC Chris Shead said: “It is with great sadness that we can confirm a body, believed to be our missing colleague Louise Gibson, was found in Little Kingshill, Buckinghamshire, this afternoon. 'Louise’s family, friends and colleagues have been informed and are being supported. I would ask that their privacy is respected. 'This is a very sad time for her family and everyone at Thames Valley Police. We have a fine tradition of pulling together in times of adversity and I am confident we will continue to pull together and support each other. WPS Gibson had served for more than 10 years at this Thames Valley police station (right) 'I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the public and the search teams for their tireless efforts in the search for Louise.' She was found in a wooded area of the leafy village of Great Kingshill today after a nationwide missing person’s appeal failed to reveal any trace of her whereabouts. The blonde mother’s worried relatives had spread news of her disappearance online in a bid to bring her back home. However, her policeman husband and children received the news today that police involved in the search had found her dead body.

The policewoman’s eldest daughter, Beth Pettit, 25, gave an interview just hours before her mother was found. She said: ‘Mum is a wonderful person and we are desperate to get her back home. ‘We have no idea what happened and that makes it really difficult to deal with. There were no mental health issues and this is completely out of character. ‘Mum always put everyone first. She was really well respected in her job and a great leader. She planned to take her inspector’s exam soon.’ Sgt Gibson, who was married once before, had two children, Beth and Robert, with her first husband Tony Cook. After they divorced, she married policeman John Gibson. Both were based at High Wycombe Police Station.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . President Barack Obama called for Israelis and Palestinians alike to restrain themselves . President Barack Obama called for Israelis and Palestinians alike to restrain themselves and put an end to acts of retribution, in some of his first public comments on the matter since the murder of three Israeli teenagers touched off a new round of violence and deepening mistrust. In an op-ed in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Obama called it a ""dangerous moment"" for the region where a vaunted U.S. peace effort recently collapsed. Writing in emotional terms, he said he couldn't imagine the pain suffered by the parents of the three Israeli teens, but was also heartbroken by the senseless murder of a Palestinian teenager who many suspect was killed as payback. ""All parties must protect the innocent and act with reasonableness and restraint, not vengeance and retribution,"" Obama said. Obama's comments, published in Hebrew, Arabic and English, reflected growing U.S. concern about tit-for-tat violence spiraling out of control as the fragile situation in Israel appears to deteriorate. After dozens of rockets rained on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, Israel's military on Tuesday launched an offensive operation including airstrikes that Palestinians said injured at least nine.

Hours after the Israeli teens were buried, 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir was abducted from outside his home and killed . After . the bodies of the three Israelis were discovered, Obama issued a brief . written statement, but hasn't spoken about the situation publicly. Haaretz said the op-ed published late Monday was intended for the . newspaper's upcoming peace summit. The White House said the op-ed was written before June 30 — the day the three Israeli teens were found dead — but later updated to reflect more recent events. Obama didn't mention Tariq Abu Khdeir, . the cousin of the murdered Palestinian, who was arrested after clashing . with Israeli forces. The State Department has said it's ""deeply troubled"" by reports that Abu Khdeir, a Palestinian-American, was badly beaten. Obama also offered strong praise for .

"By . Darren Boyle . British airman dropped copies of the plan for a post-war welfare state on Nazi German to demoralise the population in an audacious propaganda exercise. Copies of the 1942 Beveridge Report were translated into German and flown by RAF bombers to Berlin and jettisoned over the city. A new book by authors John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldrige uncovers the secret war-time story of how the RAF dropped leaflets instead of bombs. Sir William Beveridge, pictured here holding a copy of his 1942 report along with his wife Jessy Janet . Copies of the Beveridge Report were translated into 22 languages - including German - and dropped on Occupied Europe by the RAF . Propaganda was an important tool during the war with 6,000,000 leaflets dropped on Germany during the first week of the conflict blaming Hitler on the outbreak of hostilities . During the first week of the conflict, RAF crews dropped an estimated six million leaflets over Germany blaming Adolf Hitler for the hostilities. Now, according to The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State, copies of Beveridge's 1942 report were found in Hitler's Berlin bunker after the fall of Nazi Germany. William Beveridge presented his radical reform to Westminster in November 1942 to outline his vision for a post-war Britain. He identified the five key 'giant evils' that plagued society as 'disease, want, ignorance, squalor and idleness'. The main aim of the report was the 'abolition of want' and called for the introduction of a social insurance scheme. He said the end of the war could allow a radical restructure of society. Beveridge's report was used by the 1945 Labour Government as the template for the NHS which introduced comprehensive healthcare 'from the cradle to the grave'. Universal benefits were also introduced as a result of the Beveridge Report . According to the book's authors, the Beveridge Report had been translated into 22 different languages. They claim that the document sold 100,000 copies within a month of its publication - with 50,000 copies purchased in the United States. In total, the report has sold an estimated 600,000 copies. According to the book's authors the first major revolution came in the 16th and 17th centuries with the development of  powerful nation states in Europe. The second revolution was during the 18th and 19th century with the Victorians reducing corruption and cronyism. Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that the creation of the welfare state after the Second World War announced the creation of a third revolution. It is believed that the Beveridge Report was studied by German economists who accepted that its proposals were very comprehensive. According to the book, Nazi officials decided that they would not give any publicity to the Beveridge Report, even though one suggested 'our enemies are taking over national socialist ideas'. The Nazis accepted the Beveridge Report was 'superior to the current German social insurance in almost all points'. Now, the authors claim the world is facing a fourth revolution, which is being led countries like China and Singapore who are 'making the greatest strides in genuine innovation'. Leaflets and reports were not the only things propaganda devices dropped by allied aircrew during the conflict. In the Far East, forged banknotes were dropped in Malaysia to undermine Japanese rule. Adrian Wooldridge, left, and John Micklethwaite, right, argue that the world is facing a new revolutionary period led by China . Copies of the Beveridge Report were found in Hitler's bunker in Berlin where German economists evaluated the scheme accepting it was far superior than their system .","RAF crews dropped copies of the Beveridge Report on occupied Europe .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Soggy bottoms and burnt crusts could be a thing of the past for troubled cooks who are making pizzas from scratch at home. A mathematician claims to have come up with the first-ever formula for the 'perfectly proportioned' pizza, taking into account factors like the ratio of topping to base. Dr Eugenia Cheng said pizza lovers get more topping per bite in a smaller pizza, but a more even spread of bites in a larger pizza. Science of the slice: Mathematician Dr Eugenia Cheng says soggy bottoms and burnt crusts could be a thing of the past, after coming up with the first-ever formula for the 'perfectly proportioned' pizza (posed by model) The mathematician from the University of Sheffield, calculated a ratio to ensure maximum flavour of topping to base. It shows that even if a person keeps the same amount of dough and topping, the ratio of topping to base in an average bite changes with the size of the pizza and smaller pizzas typically have more topping per bite than larger ones. Dr Cheng said it is not only about how thick the base is, but about the balance of flavours between the topping and the dough that determines how much topping an individual can enjoy per bite. She used d as the constant volume of dough and t for the constant volume of topping to come up with a mathematical formula for the ratio of topping to base in a median bite. The formula: Dr Cheng explains 'd' is the constant volume of dough, and 't' is the constant volume of topping. The rest provides the correct ratio of base to topping for the optimum mouthful . Dr Cheng calculated that in relative terms, the average bite taken from an 11 inch pizza has 10 per cent more topping than the average bite from a 14 inch pizza. The formula also reveals that while . smaller pizzas have more topping per bite, for home cooks seeking lots of extras on their creations, there is a . larger risk of their pizza having a soggy bottom. She created another formula, alpha, divided by the radius of a pizza, squared to work crust sizes for pizzas of different diameters. She explains the size of the pizza's crust is proportional to the thickness of the pizza - the larger the pizza, the thinner the base, so the smaller the crust. She determined the value of alpha was 15 experimentally, by making several pizzas of different sizes. The mathematician came up with these formulas as she was asked by chain restaurant PizzaExpress to work out why its 14 inch Romana pizzas, which have a thinner and crispier base than the Classic 11 inch pizzas, are proving so popular. Size matters: Dr Cheng says a larger pizza must have a thinner base to compensate for more spread-out toppings, while a smaller pizza needs a thicker base . Dr. Cheng has found that the secret lies in proportions of the 14 inch pizza as it cooks just as evenly as the smaller version but the topping is spread over a larger area and goes close to the edge of the pizza. However, technically, pizza lovers in search of the most topping per bite should opt for the 11 inch classic version, based on the research. She said: 'I'm always looking for more ways to bring food and maths together, as they're two of my favourite things, but most people prefer food. 'I like showing that maths is everywhere in the world around us, and that we can use maths to give a logical explanation for something we've discovered by gut feeling, like that smaller pizzas are at more risk of having a soggy bottom!' Rebecca Farrer, Brand Director at PizzaExpress said that regular diners at the chain might not know that 'it’s our dough, how our pizzaiolos stretch it and how they arrange the toppings that really makes the difference, ensuring their favourite pizza is cooked perfectly every time.' The formula comes as PizzaExpress tweaks its dough for the first time since 1965, adding 15g to its pizza recipes. 'It may not seem like much at all but it means that the thickness of every Romana pizza, which is rolled with a rolling pin to ensure an even amount of dough across the whole of the base and no air pockets, is even more consistent than before,' Ms Farrer said. 'For people who are as obsessive about pizza as we are, 15g makes all the difference,' she added.","Dr Eugenia Cheng said pizza lovers get more topping per bite in a smaller pizza but a more even spread of bites in a larger pizza .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A would-be grocery store robber in Arizona has learned the hard way not to mess with an Army Special Forces veteran. The violent encounter was captured on surveillance video at Maen Mdanat's convenience store in Tucson in late April. A camera trained on the entrance to Axis Food Mart captured the business owner toppling his much younger opponent to the ground with a couple of swift kicks and punches after the suspect attacked him inside the store. Scroll down for video . Late night visit: The man seen on the left walked inside Maen Mdanat's grocery store in Tuscon, Arizona, and asked for cash, but instead he was shown the door by the owner . Sneak attack: Instead of walking away peacefully, the would-be robber sucker-punched the business owner on his way out . As the would-be robber continued to show resistance while lying prostrate on his back, Mdanat delivered a few more blows just to get his point across. After the dust settled, Mdanat allowed his defeated foe to walk away. What the unwelcome guest could not have known when he entered Mdanat’s store at around 1.30am on April 26 with the intent to make a quick buck is that the middle-aged business owner had been trained in a U.S. Army Special Forces unit. ‘He was comfortable walking in, showing his muscle, like, “I can do whatever I want,’ Mdanat later told KVOA-TV. ‘That’s basically the message he gave me when he walked in but I changed his idea when he walked out.’ Cat-like reflexes: The middle-aged bodega owner armed with Special Forces training took on his opponent without a moment's hesitation .

"By . Andy Dolan . Two sisters who criticised a group of online ‘paedophile hunters’ for confronting a suspect who later committed suicide were themselves viciously targeted by the group, it emerged last night. Claire and Emma Harris accused Letzgo Hunting of ‘acting like thugs’ after they were bombarded with abusive messages by the vigilante group, which also published one of the sisters’ social networking addresses online. At least two other people have also received threats or abusive messages from the group, which yesterday denied responsibility for causing the death of engineer Gary Cleary. Concerned: Claire Harris, left, and her sister Emma, right, have accused Letzgo Hunting of 'acting like thugs' One, who posted criticism on Letzgo Hunting’s Facebook page, said he received a reply from a follower warning: ‘I will cut your throat if I see you in the street’. Mr Cleary, 29, was confronted by Letzgo Hunting members in Braunstone Park, Leicester, in early May, but fled as they approached him. The group says it lured him there by posing as a 14-year-old girl in an online chat. The footage was posted online and he was arrested days later, questioned and released on bail. Mr Cleary, who lived with his girlfriend in Newbold Verdon, Leicestershire, was found dead in his garage four days later. How the Daily Mail reported the death of suspect Gary Cleary, who had been confronted by the vigilante group . Letzgo Hunting claim to be a band of concerned parents in Hinckley, Leicestershire, who pose as girls aged 12 to 15 on internet dating and social networking sites to set up meetings with paedophiles looking for sex. Footage of the confrontations is put on their website, as well as their Facebook and YouTube pages, with the suspect’s faces visible. If an arrest is made, the footage is doctored to disguise a suspect’s identity, but remains online. Yesterday the group told the BBC it would not change its methods following the death of Mr Cleary. But its founder, who uses the name ‘Jamie’, later posted a message saying he was leaving the group after his name was partially revealed online. He denied being responsible for any abuse from the Letzgo Hunting Facebook page and added: ‘If someone’s been upset by it, I wasn’t aware of it.’ Trap: A suspect runs from a member of Letzgo Hunting who lure suspected sex offenders into meetings by posing as young girls online . Claire, 31, said that after she saw the group’s footage of its encounter with Mr Cleary in May, she messaged its Facebook page to condemn the tactic. But within hours she said it sent her a message branding her a paedophile. She was then blocked from posting further comments on its page. When her 34-year-old sister messaged the site to complain, the group posted her Facebook address and Twitter name on its webpage, with a message claiming she was supporting paedophiles. It urged the group’s 11,000 Facebook followers to ‘show her some love cuz I’ve had enough’. The siblings each reported the abuse and harassment to their local police forces. Last night Claire said some of those who had viewed the video had posted threats to kill Mr Cleary or said they knew where he lived. Emma, a single mother-of-one from North Yorkshire, said she feared for the safety of her child after Letzgo Hunting tweeted the name of her street in a message suggesting they should ‘go hunting’ in the neighbourhood. Another tweet warned her: ‘U will feel the love that paedophiles get, because, by condoning their actions and condemning ours, you are equal!’. She said: ‘I actually warned Letzgo Hunting that I was worried their videos could lead to somebody getting hurt or taking their own life. ‘I can’t believe the way they went for me. It only takes one idiot to decide to look me up – all for trying to have a civilised debate with these people on Facebook.’ The website logo of 'Letzgo Hunting', a Leicestershire group of 'paedophile hunters' who confronted a 29-year-old who killed himself after he was arrested . Claire, a mother-of-three from Leicestershire, said she came across the group’s activities when a friend posted a comment on their video of the confrontation with Mr Cleary. She added: ‘I was immediately concerned that this way of working posed a risk to the public, not only to the men being targeted but also anybody mistaken for being the subject of one of their videos.’ Referring to Jamie, she said: ‘I also find it alarming that he works incognito to protect his own family, but thinks nothing of posting my sister’s details onto a public forum.’ An inquest at Loughborough last week concluded Mr Cleary had ‘died by his own hand’. Coroner Trevor Kirkman made no reference to his encounter with Letzgo Hunting or his arrest.","Claire and Emma Harris have been bombarded with abusive messages .

"By . Louise Boyle . and James  Nye . and Lydia Warren . Ever since he was evicted from his makeshift home inside the Manhattan Bridge, homeless man Joe Zhou has found refuge in a 24-hour McDonald's - but he is not lovin' it. A dozen officers wearing helmets and brandishing hammers raided Zhou's humble abode Thursday morning and tore apart his coffin-sized hovel, which he had built from flimsy wood. Officers removed his belongings, including pots, bedsheets, clothing and even electrical items, before dumping them in an overflowing truck. Scroll down for video . Displaced: Homeless man Joe Zhou who lived under the Manhattan Bridge was removed and his home between the beams of the bridge was tore apart by the NYPD . Under the Golden Arches: Zhou has been spending his nights in a 24-hour McDonald's eatery . Zhou, 57, was taken to the Bellevue . Men's Shelter in Midtown Manhattan, but he did not stay there long, . instead decamping to a 24-hour McDonald's. Speaking to a New York Post reporter through a Chinese translator, Zhou explained that he is wary of people who might recognize him, and he does not like to stay in shelters. The Chinese immigrant lamented the loss of his shack, which he had constructed thanks to a set of skills he pick up while working on building projects in New York and Boston. His tiny nook under the bridge featured a functioning stove, a reading lamp and a pantry stocked with Bud beer cans and Sriracha. To make ends meet, the 57-year-old has been selling casino vouchers on the black market - a popular trade among the city's homeless and unemployed. Lingering questions: Zhou had a family and a job in China, but for some unknown reason, he picked up and left 17 years ago, settling in New York . Troubled past: Zhou has run afoul of the law and wound up on the streets because he was unable to afford a rent . According to the Post, the now-notorious vagrant had a wife and children in China, but for reasons unknown he picked up and left 17 years ago, moving to the U.S. Upon his arrival in New York City, Zhou found odd jobs to support himself, including frying egg rolls at a Chinese restaurant, but he never stayed anywhere for more than a couple of weeks. Things took a turn for the worse when Zhou ran into some trouble with the law and wound up on the streets. Unable to afford rent, Zhou erected shanties on the grass near the Manhattan Bridge, but police knocked them down. That is when the 57-year-old decided to seek refuge inside the frame of the span. Ripped down: Law enforcement officers are pictured ripping down a homeless man's shack on the Manhattan Bridge on Thursday morning after his dwelling was revealed last month . Removed: The team pulled down the man's belongings from the shack where he has been living for a year . Evicted: The man living inside the bridge is pictured after police arrived on the scene on Thursday . For . a year, the man had managed to quietly come and go from his home on the . cyclists' side of the New York City landmark, which connects Manhattan . and Brooklyn. But his hideaway was discovered last month after a . cyclist called 911 saying he thought the man was trying to commit suicide - . when he was actually climbing into the safe confines of his tiny home. The NYPD said that the home had to be demolished because it was dangerous for Zhou and for those who use the cycle path of the bridge. MailOnline spoke to him at the home earlier this week and, speaking in heavily-accented English, he said that he arrived in New York City from China 13 years ago. Belongings: They pulled down his belongings and piled them high in trucks to be discarded . Carted away: His items, including bedding and wood, filled a truck near to the Manhattan Bridge . Stash: The team of police officers pulled down his belongings on Thursday, including electrical items . When asked where he had lived in China . before arriving in the United States, the 57-year-old said that he had . worked in Shanghai, but had left to try and find a better life in the . United States. Claiming to have suffered a financial loss through gambling, Zhou said that for the past year he had called the Manhattan Bridge his home - constructing the base between the girders using wood discarded from nearby Chinatown. Indeed, dotted around the shack built into the bridge was evidence of his shanty construction - wooden boards and used water bottles litter the area. Zhou said that there were others who . lived in or near to the bridge - including one woman who had moved her . worldly possessions off the cycling ramp to the entrance of of the famous structure finished in 1912. Looking inside: An image shows the inside of the man's home in the frame of the bridge . Discovery: Department of Transportation workers help pull down the insides of the man's home . Thrown away: They broke up the wood and pulled down bed sheets and pieces of carpet, pictured . Supplies: Zhou had a pantry in his shack stocked with beer, Sriracha and salt . Crowd: Members of the NYPD looked on as officers pulled down items on Thursday morning . Surprisingly . well dressed for a man who lives in a bridge, Mr Zhou said that the brutal . winter that New York and the nation just experienced was difficult to . endure. He also said that he was working on a second . shack just 15-feet up the ramp from his current abode. Each of the cramped homes were around ten feet-by-one-and-a-half feet and seemed to be protected with bike locks. The . tiny, narrow dwellings were just big enough for one person to lie down. The living spaces also provided little silence as loud subway trains . rumbled by on four different tracks, 24 hours a day. Emerging: The man who lived in the shack said his name was Joey. He is pictured by his home this week . Looking inside: Water bottles and wooden planks litter the area where 'Joey' built his home on the bridge . Daylight: Earlier this week, Zhou explained that he has been coming and going from the home for a year. But a passerby saw him climbing into the home and thought he was committing suicide, so called the cops . Heading home: 'Joey' headed back to his shack to replace his umbrella after it stopped raining . The spot was also poorly lit and well-trafficked with bikers who speed past, not expecting to see a pedestrian on this side of the bridge. Zhou likely picked the spot because . it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof. There is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway. Last . Sunday, a cyclist saw the vagrant climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him . for a jumper, calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending . suicide. Before: His home, only accessible by the cyclists' lane, was snapped in daylight before it was pulled down . Secret: His home, seen above the cyclists' lane, was accessed by climbing over the steel railings .","Joe Zhou, 57, was taken to a homeless shelter Thursday after police officers ripped down the shack he had built into the bridge's girders .

"By . Emma Innes . We're always being told that white bread is unhealthy and we should stick to wholemeal. But new research suggests it could actually be a healthy option. A study found it significantly boosts the number of ‘good’ microbes in the stomach, warding off disease and leading to better health. Eating white bread could increase the levels of 'good' bacteria in the gut, research suggests . The finding could mean the much-maligned white loaf regains some of its popularity after being banished to the back of the supermarket shelf. In a surprising twist in the white bread story, scientists found it encourages the growth ‘good’ gut bacteria. The Spanish study looked at the bacteria in people’s guts and what role they play in people’s health. This is important because it is known that when certain populations of bacteria drop, we become more prone to disease. One of the most effective ways to maintain a good balance of the microbes is to eat well. The team, from the University of Oviedo, investigated the role of polyphenols, common in such items as spices, teas, fruits and vegetables and how they worked to help balance the microbes in people’s guts. If 'good' bacteria levels fall, people are at increased risk of disease . They asked 38 healthy adults questions about their diets and worked out which bacteria were present in their stool samples. Their analysis revealed that pectin, a compound in citrus fruits, lowers the levels of some helpful bacteria, contrary to previous research. But, their most unusual finding was that white bread boosted Lactobacillus, a group of beneficial bacteria. To date, wholegrain foods have been linked to increased ‘good’ bacteria levels, because of their high fibre content. However, the latest study found consumption of often undervalued refined grains – such as in white bread and white rice – could also boost the level of health-giving microbes. Study co-author Dr Sonia González said: ‘Although the limited sample size and high variability of individuals do not allow firm conclusions to be established, our study highlights the importance of considering diet as a whole, rather than isolated components. ‘The identification of an association between the intake of regular foods, such as oranges or white bread, and certain microbial groups emphasises the requirement of future research focused on diet rather than on isolated compounds.’ However it has not been all good news for white bread lovers. recently. Just two weeks ago, a study revealed eating three slices of white bread a day increases the odds of becoming overweight by almost half. The European Congress on Obesity, in Sofia, Bulgaria, was told wholegrain bread does not lead to weight gain while white bread does. The researchers, from the University of Navarra, in Spain, revealed that people who eat 120g or more of white bread a day are 40 per cent more likely to pile on the pounds than those who eat 60g or less a week.","When certain populations of gut bacteria drop, diseases can develop .

"By . Sam Webb . A woman teacher was struck off for life today for sex sessions with a 16-year-old boy pupil - and her headteacher was also suspended for covering up the affair. Teacher Emma Ager, 34, picked the teenager up after classes at the 950-pupil Rhymney Comprehensive School in Tredegar, South Wales, to drive him away to have regular sex in her car. Headteacher Meredydd James, 62, then covered up the rumoured relationship after she agreed to resign - and gave her a glowing reference. A disciplinary hearing was told the English teacher told the boy: 'I bet you won’t be able to keep up with me during sex.' Emma Ager, 34, a teacher who worked at Rhymney Comprehensive School, in Tredegar, South Wales, has been struck off for life after having sex sessions with a 16-year-old boy pupil in her car . The boy - referred to as Pupil A in the hearing - was studying his GSCEs when Miss Ager began driving him off for secret sex in a factory car park. The former pupil, who is now 22, told the hearing: 'She said as long as I kept quiet everything would be OK. 'We would meet up daily or every other day. 'We would meet up an hour or two after school and drive and have sex in her car. We would drive to a secluded spot near a factory. 'We only ever had sex in her car. 'She said if people did find out I would be a legend. It continued for two months. 'One of my friends rang her up to ask for a threesome but she said she wouldn’t do it. 'It was common knowledge among pupils in the school but I don’t know if the teachers knew. I left a short time after it ended.' The South Wales school attended by the pupil. Now 22, he said the teacher kept a picture of his penis on her mobile phone . The hearing was told Miss Ager had taught for two years when she began having sex with the pupil. The boy claimed he was told Miss Ager had a picture of his penis on her mobile phone. The hearing was told she bombarded him with phone calls and sexual text messages during the two-month relationship in 2008. Pupil A said: 'On a school trip to London sombody saw she had a photo of my penis on her mobile phone but she said it was somebody else’s. 'She brought me back a teddy and some sweets.' Pupil A ended the two-month sexual relationship in March 2008 to be get back with his ex-girlfriend. The General Teaching Council for Wales professional conduct hearing in Cardiff heard Pupil A’s mother found out her son was getting inappropriate phone calls and texts from Miss Ager. She told the school about the inappropriate calls - but she did not know it was a sexual relationship. The pupil told the hearing Miss Ager bombarded him with phone calls and sexual text messages during the two-month relationship in March 2008 . GTCW presenting solicitor Martin Jones said Miss Ager was pulled into a meeting with her headteacher about inappropriate contact with Pupil A. Mr Jones said: 'As a result of that she offered her resignation and it was accepted. 'She left the school a short while later.' Headteacher Meredydd James failed to follow child protection policy by reporting the sex allegations and inappropriate calls to social services. Instead he accepted Miss Ager’s immediate resignation - and gave the English teacher a glowing reference. He told a nearby school: 'Miss Ager expected high standards of behaviour and had a good working relationship with pupils. 'She would be a great asset to the school.' But Mr James had harboured serious concerns about her conduct even before the sex allegations. He told Miss Ager in a meeting: 'If I dig too deep I’m worried what I will find.' Their affair was revealed in 2012 when school staff went on a safeguarding course - and told council officials about his handling of the rumoured affair. Mr Jones said Mr James had heard enough serious allegations to trigger a referral to social services. Mr Jones said: 'He chose not to make one. 'He had information which at the very least pointed to suspicion of Miss Ager engaging in a sexual relationship with pupils. 'He allowed the teacher to leave the school without proper investigation and then opted to provide a positive reference to another school. 'He placed other pupils at other schools in potential risk of harm - pupils who may have been more vulnerable.' The GTCW panel ruled Miss Ager was proved to have committed unacceptable professional conduct by having an 'inappropriate and/or sexual relationship with a 16-year-old pupil'. She did not attend the disciplinary hearing and failed to answer the charges. Mr James, now retired, was proved to have failed to follow proper child protection procedures and take appropriate action. Miss Ager was prohibited from the teaching register indefinitely in any state school in Britain. Panel chairman Steve Powell said: 'This is necessary to protect pupils and maintain public confidence in the teaching profession. 'Miss Ager has shown no insight into her failings.' Mr James was suspended from the register for three months and ordered to undergo a safeguarding course before re-entering the profession. Mr Powell said: 'These incidents cannot be described as an isolated lapse. But they did occur during 18 months of a 40-year career. His conduct could have seriously affected pupils.'","Emma Ager, 34, had a relationship with pupil in 2008 .

"By . Jason Groves . In an outspoken attack, Ed Vaizey says his own government's 'presumption in favour of development' is artificially raising estimates of housing demand . The countryside could be swamped with thousands of unwanted homes under new planning laws, a minister warned yesterday. In an outspoken attack, Ed Vaizey says his own government's 'presumption in favour of development' is artificially raising estimates of housing demand. In a letter to planning minister Nick Boles, the culture minister lays bare Tory fears that the coalition's decision to tear up planning laws risks alienating traditional supporters and costing votes. Mr Vaizey, who is one of David Cameron's closest allies, says the projected levels of housing need in parts of the countryside – including his own Oxfordshire constituency – are up to three times the true figure. He warns this has 'significant consequences for many local communities which are now faced with levels of growth that will fundamentally change the nature of settlements'. He calls for an 'urgent review of the planning methodology that leads to such massive numbers of homes being planned, so that more realistic outcomes result'. He says councils are being forced to earmark more and more land for housing or risk falling foul of the development presumption that leaves them little power to block projects they think excessive. In his reply, Mr Boles defended the push for new housing, saying: 'One of the key constraints that is affecting growth in some of our most prosperous and dynamic regions are high house prices and affordability. I am sure you will agree this is something we are all working hard to change.' And he suggested that Mr Vaizey had got some of his facts wrong. He said the new assessment of housing need 'did not automatically invalidate' local housing plans and confirmed building on the green belt should be allowed only in exceptional circumstances. Mr Boles said Oxfordshire should consider creating a new garden city if local communities were unhappy with the idea of expanding existing developments. Mr Vaizey had warned that the lax rules around infrastructure meant that developers often delivered vital services such as roads and schools years after the houses are built. Mr Vaizey, who is one of David Cameron's closest allies, says the projected levels of housing need in parts of the countryside ¿ including his own Oxfordshire constituency ¿ are up to three times the true figure . The result, he says, is that 'new and existing residents suffer a severe decline in services for a number of years'. Mr Vaizey's comments are focused on the situation in Oxfordshire, where there is controversy over official projections that the county needs 100,000 new homes. He says demographic trends in his own district of the county, the Vale of the White Horse, suggest an extra 468 homes a year are needed. But the 'national methodology' has produced a figure up to three times higher. Four local councils in Oxfordshire have raised concerns about the plans. These include West Oxfordshire, which is run by Mr Cameron's election agent Barry Norton. Mr Norton said official housing projections were wrong and were likely to be challenged by the council. The Prime Minister this week defended the planning changes, and said the result was that 'planning applications are going up, house building is going up – a 23 per cent increase in houses built'. He said the planning system was locally driven, and denied claims that Tory councils were blocking housing developments. He added: 'We've been building in West Oxfordshire more houses than was actually set out under our plan. I don't accept that all these councils are nimbys.'","Ed Vaizey claims countryside could be swamped with unwanted homes .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Findings bring the collections of stone tools, animal bone and Neanderthal remains under renewed study . Our modern language can be traced back to Neanderthals living half a million years ago, scientists have claimed. Research increasingly seems to indicate . that our close cousins, the Neanderthals, were much more similar to us . than imagined even a decade ago. Dutch researchers argue that the last common ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals around half a million years ago, shared speech and language with modern humans. They believe that the origins of out modern language are ten times older than previously thought. The scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the Netherlands are interested in the implications for understanding present day linguistic diversity. Popular opinion is that they spoke in primitive grunts, but Neanderthal man successfully inhabited vast swathes of western Eurasia for several hundreds of thousands of years, during harsh ages and milder interglacial periods. Historians know that our closest cousins share a common ancestor with us around half  million years ago, probably the species Homo heidelbergensis. But what is relatively unknown is what their cognitive capabilities were like. Experts also question why modern humans succeeded in replacing them after thousands of years of cohabitation. Recently, due to new . palaeoanthropological and archaeological discoveries and the . reassessment of older data, but especially to the availability of . ancient DNA, we have started to realise that their fate was much more . intertwined with ours. An artist's impression of a den. Scientists argue modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals. Their interpretation of scare evidence contradicts a popular scenario believed by most language scientists, who think our modern language began with a sudden emergence of modernity . Psycholinguistics researchers Dan Dediuand Stephen C. Levinson, said that far from being slow brutes, their . cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours. The duo, who have looked at past findings in detail, argue that essentially modern language and speech . are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most . recent ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans . (another form of humanity known mostly from their genome). Their interpretation of scare evidence contradicts a popular scenario believed by most language scientists, who think our modern language began with a sudden emergence of modernity presumably due to one or a few genetic mutations that gave rise to language. In contrast, the two researchers think it was a slower process of gradual accumulation of biological and cultural progress. It seems hard to believe that Neanderthals shared language as well as some dinner favourites with modern humans. The researchers thinks that Neanderthals adopted language slowly . Their paper is published in Frontiers in Language Sciences and pushed back the origins of modern language by ten times what was previously thought. Scientists had thought that our modern language began around 50,000 years ago. But the pair believe that it could have started somewhere between the origins of our genus, Homo, some 1.8 million years ago, and the emergence of Homo heidelbergensis. The scientists said that given that archaeological and genetic data shows modern humans spreading from Africa mixed with Neanderthals and Denisovans, then just as we carry around some of their genes, our languages may preserve traces of theirs. They think that their idea can be tested by comparing the structural properties of African and non-African languages and by computer simulations of language spread. However, it might be harder to prove that Neanderthals contributed to specific words in our modern vocabularies.","Origins of modern language are ten times older than thought and could date back half a million years, according to Dutch researchers .

The Archbishop, who has acted as a hostage negotiator in Nigeria on behalf of the Church in the past, said the girls were at ‘colossal’ risk. ‘They are in the hands of a very disparate group which is extremely irrational and difficult to deal with – and utterly merciless,’ he told BBC Radio Four’s The World This Weekend programme. The Archbishop said he had negotiated in the past with a predecessor group of Boko Haram and suggested it might be ‘possible’ to strike a deal – although he warned it was ‘questionable’ who was in charge of the group. Michelle Obama shared this photo of herself along with the caption 'Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families' He added: ‘You have a very, very difficult inner core (of Boko Haram) and I think negotiations there are extremely complicated, though it needs to be tried. 'And then it goes out and out in different layers of commitment and understanding and involvement. There needs to be active negotiation and contact with all those different layers.’ Mr Cameron said he had spoken to Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan to offer assistance and confirmed counter-terrorism and intelligence experts are on the ground with the Americans. ‘We stand ready to do anything more that the Nigerians would want,’ he said. But he also pointed out the practical difficulties of any rescue operation. ‘It’s immensely complicated because they are probably in this deep area of jungle that is three times the size of Wales,’ he said. Amy Poehler (right) and Malala Yousafzai (left) tweeted their support for the Bring Back Our Girls campaign . The Twitter campaign yesterday drew support from the Pope, who wrote on the site: ‘Let us all join in prayer for the immediate release of the schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria. #BringBackOurGirls.’ Christiane Amanpour, a reporter with CNN, asked the PM to join the campaign as she sat with him on the sofa. She praised the campaign which she said was ‘really getting to the people in Nigeria’ but said she worried its bubble might burst with nothing concrete having been done. Hilary Clinton was among those who tweeted in support of the campaign, which encourages military intervention to recover the girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram rebels on April 14 . Armed men from Boko Haram kidnapped the girls from a school in Chibok in the lawless Borno region in the north of the country on April 14. Around 53 escaped but some 276 remain captive. There are fears they have been split up into different groups, taken across the border into neighbouring countries and may be sold on as sex slaves. Yesterday, amid further kidnappings and a bomb attack on a bridge, one teenage girl who escaped from the group said the kidnapping was ‘too terrifying for words.’ Science student Sarah Lawan, 19, described how the girls were taken from their school before dawn and forced into a truck. Alex Chung (left) and Leona Lewis (right) have also joined the campaign by handwriting the messages . Kevin Frazier and Thea Andrews, co-hosts of The Insider, shared this photo via Twitter .

Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram said last week he would sell the remaining captives as slaves for as little as £7. Boko Haram has killed more than 1,500 people this year as it steps up its campaign of violence. The name of the groups means ‘Western education is forbidden’. Mrs Obama said she and the President were ‘outraged and heartbroken’ over the abduction. Demonstration: .

Yesterday Boko Haram was blamed for a bridge blowing up and for further kidnappings. Last week the Mail revealed British Special Forces were on standby to help rescue the girls. That was despite resistance among senior military personnel to putting boots on the ground.","The PM followed Michelle Obama and celebrities including Cara Delevingne .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Tim Shipman . Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured in his Witney constituency, insisted the Philpott case raised questions about the welfare state . David Cameron today weighed into the bitter row over linking the Mick Philpott arson case to the need to overhaul Britain's troubled benefits system. The Prime Minister backed Chancellor George Osborne for suggesting the tragic case raised questions about the way some people come to rely on state handouts. Mr Cameron insisted Philpott, jailed this week for starting a fire which killed six of his children, was to blame for his crimes but argued that welfare must not be seen as a 'lifestyle choice'. The political row over the Philpott case erupted after the Daily Mail pointed out that the dad-of-17 was a product of the benefits system. Yesterday Mr Osborne said there needed to be a debate 'for . government and for society about the welfare state'. It provoked a storm of outrage from the Left, accusing the Chancellor of 'demeaning' his office. But today he received the defiant backing of Mr Cameron, who said Mr Osborne was 'absolutely right'. The Prime Minister added: 'He [Mr Osborne] said the Mr Philpott was the one to blame for his crimes, that he should be held responsible; but what the Chancellor went on to say was that we should ask some wider questions about our welfare system, how much it costs and the signals that it sends. 'And we do want to make clear that welfare is there to help people who work hard, it shouldn’t be there as a sort of lifestyle choice, and I think that’s entirely legitimate.' Scroll down for video . 'Why are we funding lifestyles like that?' Chancellor George Osborne has linked the case of jobless father-of-17 Mick Philpott (right), who was jailed for life for killing six of his children in a house fire, to the need for reform of the benefits system . Scrounger: Mick Philpott (pictured with his wife Mairead, centre, his mother Peggy, right, and sons Jesse, right in green, and John, far right) claimed thousands of pounds in benefit and refused to get a job . Mr Osborne attracted howls of outrage . last night simply for pointing out that the appalling case strengthened . the need for welfare reform. In . an extraordinary reaction from Labour, the Chancellor was described as a . ‘disgrace’ for making his comments on the day that father-of-17 . Philpott, his wife Mairead and accomplice Paul Mosley were jailed for . burning the couple’s six children to death. Did the benefits system contribute to the Philpott fire killings? The jury at Nottingham Crown Court . had heard that one of the motivations for Philpott’s sickening crimes . was his desire to get his hands on the benefits money which vanished . when his live-in lover left with their five children. The . subsequent row over whether the welfare system lies at the heart of the . appalling case has dominated radio phone-ins and internet message . boards all week. Mr Osborne made his comments during a visit to the Philpotts’ home city of Derby, where he was asked if the couple were a product of the benefits system. He replied: ‘Philpott is responsible for these absolutely horrendous crimes, that have shocked the nation. 'The courts are responsible for sentencing. Shameless: Former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe, who filmed a documentary about Philpott's lifestyle, said she was appalled by a state system which allowed a man to live in this way . Hated by the nation: Mick Philpott's infamous appearance on the Jeremy Kyle Show in 2009 when he was roundly criticised for demanding a bigger council house for his expanding brood . Front-page news: Yesterday's Daily Mail on Philpott's conviction . ‘But I think there is a question for . government and for society about the welfare state, and the taxpayers . who pay for the welfare state, subsidising lifestyles like that. 'And I think that debate needs to be had.’ The . Chancellor has led the Government’s defence of changes in the welfare . system and this week accused opponents of talking ‘ill-informed . rubbish’. In the face of growing pressure from churches, charities and opposition parties, Mr Osborne said suggestions that the changes marked the end of the welfare state were ‘shrill, headline-seeking nonsense’. Within hours of his remarks about Philpott, he faced a backlash from Left-wingers who accused him of ‘cynically’ exploiting the tragedy to push the Government’s case for cuts to handouts. Senior Tories said the reaction of the Opposition is proof that it still fails to grasp the depth of public fury at the way some have abused the benefits system. The prosecution presented evidence that Philpott hatched the plot to burn down his house when his mistress Lisa Willis decided to flee their home, taking with her £1,000 a month in benefit payments. On the attack: Labour's Dame Anne Begg and Shadow work and pensions minister Stephen Timms have accused Osborne of acting 'cynically' That move was described as the ‘catalyst for everything that was to follow’. Despite . this, Mr Osborne’s intervention sparked an extraordinary reaction. Shadow health spokesman Jamie Reed tweeted: ‘Just seen Osborne’s . comments. What a sickening figure he is. Utterly beneath contempt. Not . fit to hold public office.’ Shadow . Chancellor Ed Balls said Mr Osborne was ‘cynical’ and ‘desperate’ but . offered no ideas about how Labour would combat the soaring welfare bill. He . said: ‘A Chancellor has to think very carefully before they comment on . the issues of the day. How they do so says a lot about the character of . their Chancellorship. ‘That is why I believe George Osborne’s calculated decision to use the shocking and vile crimes of Mick Philpott to advance a political argument is the cynical act of a desperate Chancellor. ‘We should have a proper debate about welfare reform. But for the Chancellor to link this wider debate to this shocking crime is nasty and divisive and demeans his office.’ The reaction from the opposition front bench was condemned by Labour activist and blogger Dan Hodges, who said Mr Balls had ‘plunged’ into a trap set by the Tories. ‘Labour’s strategy on Philpott and welfare is suicidal,’ he said. ‘The Tories want lots of stories tomorrow that have the phrases “Mick Philpott”, “Welfare”, and “Labour defends welfare”. They’re going to get them. ‘You don’t need to be a master strategist to make a monkey of the Labour Party on the issue of welfare. Labour should back a welfare freeze, in the same way it backs a freeze in public sector wages.’ Mr Hodges added that on Philpott Labour should say: ‘We’re not  commenting. This is a terrible tragedy, our thoughts are with the victims.’","Prime Minister says Philpott was to blame for his crimes but welfare cannot be a 'lifestyle choice'

"By . David Wilkes . For more than 80 years, the Aga cooker has been the heart of thousands of quintessentially British homes. Permanently on and warming the kitchen, it has brought comfort and joy to those who swear by its traditional simplicity and old-style charm. But now the Aga has been thrust into the digital age with the launch of a model which can be turned on and off with a text message. Scroll down for video . The new cooker contains a SIM card and can be activated via text message - with users receiving a confirmation saying 'Roasting Oven Activated' On sale from this Friday, the AGA . iTotal Control will set you back £10,090. It has three ovens – for . roasting, baking and simmering – all of which can be operated remotely. It is a development of the £9,895 AGA . Total Control cooker, which was the first electric Aga that could be . switched on and off as the user required. Traditional Agas – which are . on all the time, guzzle up to 40 litres of oil a week and pump carbon . dioxide into the air – have been criticised for being environmentally . unfriendly. Modern Agas are programmable and reach cooking temperature only when you need them. The new model receives commands via a . standard mobile phone SIM card inserted into a small box, similar to a . broadband router, which is connected to the cooker by a cable. Cyber-stove: PC users can also log in to a dedicated website to turn on any of the three ovens from afar - the oven connects to your home wi-fi network, so you don't need to run wiring through the kitchen . Once the cooker is installed, you . save its unique phone number into your mobile and when you wish to . operate it remotely you text one of the following commands: roasting . oven on; baking oven on; simmering oven on; all ovens on; all zones off. Once the text has been sent you receive a reply saying, for example, ‘roasting oven on activated’. The Aga can also be operated via an . app which can be downloaded to smartphones from Apple’s app store or the . Android Marketplace. Owners can also register on a dedicated website which allows them to control the oven from a laptop. The makers yesterday hailed it as their response to ‘things getting decidedly more techie in the kitchen’ these days. ‘You can ensure the cooker is warm . and supper will be cooked at exactly the time you need it – wherever you . are in the world,’ said a spokesman. But not all Aga lovers are simmering with excitement at the new model. Best-selling author Jilly Cooper, 75, . speaking from her home in Gloucestershire, said: ‘I don’t believe it – . it’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard. I love my Aga to bits, but I . can’t even text on the phone. ‘Oh bless it, will I have to learn to text now? Maybe something like this will drag me into the 21st century at last.’ Miss Cooper, who is writing her latest . novel about flat-racing, added: ‘Agas are heaven. The wonderful thing . about mine is that it’s always on and I can leave it on overnight and . slow-cook stews for my dogs for the morning.’ The new model has a built-in SIM card but can also be controlled via apps on iPads and smartphones .

"By . Jason Groves, Political Correspondent . A grieving mother yesterday condemned Nick Clegg for opposing tough new measures to tackle knife crime. Caroline Shearer said the Liberal Democrats appeared to have no understanding of the dangers posed to young people by knives as the furious public backlash against their opposition to mandatory jail terms grew. And she questioned whether Mr Clegg would take the same view if his own children were threatened. Caroline Shearer, whose son Jay (right) was stabbed to death aged 17 at a house party, has blasted Nick Clegg after the Deputy PM said he would block any crackdown on knife crime . Miss Shearer, whose son Jay Whiston was stabbed to death aged 17 at a house party in Essex in 2012, said people want ‘protection, not politics’. Referring to Tory plans to introduce automatic six-month jail sentences for anyone caught with a knife a second time, she said: ‘My son drowned in his own blood – in his lungs – and they want to give these people a second chance? ‘Once is enough to kill, you do not need to give them a second chance. ‘Everybody out there has children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces – it’s about protecting them. If someone went up to Nick Clegg’s child and waved a knife at them would Nick Clegg really be happy?’ Miss Shearer, who has set up a group to campaign against knife crime, said MPs were too cocooned from reality by their security to understand the real damage caused by the weapons. The Deputy Prime Minister has confirmed that he would veto the introduction of what he called ‘headline-grabbing solutions’ in the wake of the murder of Leeds teacher Ann Maguire last week. He claimed he was ‘not soft on knife crime at all’ but said he would block mandatory jail terms for repeat offenders. Mr Clegg’s comments prompted a furious backlash. One caller to his regular phone-in show on LBC Radio demanded to know how many times people needed to be caught carrying a blade before they were punished. Referring to the Lib Dem leader, he added: ‘How are elderly people meant to sleep in their beds when you’ve got lunatics in suits like him who are looking after this country?’ A caller to Clegg's regular LBC radio show . The Coalition row erupted last week after the Mail revealed that Mr Clegg was blocking plans to crack down on knife crime. He confirmed yesterday that he would not allow the plans to go ahead, claiming the measure could ‘turn the young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow’. But he was facing the prospect of a humiliating  Commons defeat over the issue after Ed Miliband said he would side with the Conservatives if they brought forward the proposals. ‘I don’t agree with Nick Clegg,’ said the Labour leader. ‘I think we do need tougher penalties for knife crime. We are definitely sympathetic to the issue of mandatory sentences after conviction for a second offence. London Mayor Boris Johnson has said measures to tackle knife crime need 'unequivocal' party support . 'The public want to know that we are going to send a strong message to people who carry knives repeatedly that it is not acceptable.’ Mr Clegg has dismissed police concerns over the issue but Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said mandatory jail sentences would have a clear deterrent effect. ‘There are too many people carrying knives so I support the idea of a minimum sentence,’ he said. ‘It sends a very clear message to people who carry knives. It’s the casual carrying of knives that eventually may lead to a murder.’ Tory MP Nick de Bois, who tabled the amendment that would introduce the necessary legislation, said Mr Clegg had ‘misjudged the public mood on this issue’. Mayor of London Boris Johnson echoed those comments, saying the measure needed ‘unequivocal’ cross-party support. ‘This amendment is a clear signal to those who act with such impunity that carrying a knife will not be tolerated,’ he said. Tory sources said Mr Cameron was sympathetic to the amendment, which has been signed by 40 Tory backbenchers. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘How we do more in this area around knife crime and how we make our streets safer is something he is giving very active consideration to.’ Earlier this week Britain’s top judge also backed heavier  sentences for knife criminals, saying they would act as a deterrent. Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas called for an urgent review of  sentencing for youths carrying knives, saying it was a ‘major problem’ among 12 to 14-year-olds. Nick Clegg will lose the next election if he acts as a ‘destructive brake’ on the Coalition, a senior Liberal Democrat warned yesterday. Jeremy Browne, who served as a Foreign Office and Home Office Minister, said the Lib Dems would pay a high electoral price if they continued to ‘adopt the mindset of an opposition party in government’.","Nick Clegg has vowed to block 'headline grabbing' crackdown on knife crime .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A female 18-year-old was arrested on two felony charges for her same-sex relationship with a 15-year-old classmate and expelled from high school, and now her family wants the charges dropped as she faces life as a convicted sex offender. Kaitlyn Hunt of Palm Bay, Florida is charged with two counts of lewd and lascivious battery on a child ages 12 to 16 for having an ‘intimate’ relationship with the unnamed girl. Hunt and the girl began dating at the start of the school year while Hunt . They played on the basketball team together and Hunt’s mother, Kelley Hunt-Smith says that both she and the girl’s parents knew about the relationship. Justice? 18-year-old Kaitlyn Hunt of Palm Bay, Florida was expelled from high school and faces two felony charges for having a consensual relationship with a 15-year-old classmate . But then Hunt turned 18 and, according to Hunt-Smith, the girl’s family decided to press charges against Hunt for her ‘intimate’ relationship with their 15-year-old daughter. In Florida, the age of consent is 18. First, says Hunt’s father Steven, Kaitlyn was dropped from the basketball team because of her relationship. Then, on February 16, Hunt was arrested at her family’s home for ‘lewd and lascivious battery.’ The girl’s parents also petitioned to have Hunt expelled from school. At first they were unsuccessful, but eventually Hunt sent to a separate school. ‘After two separate judges ruled that Kaitlyn could finish her senior year with her peers, her girlfriend's parents appealed to the Indian River County School Board, who expelled Kaitlyn sent her to the alternative school,’ writes Hunt-Smith in a Facebook post. Morals: Hunt's family, including mom Kelley Hunt Smith, right, say Kaitlyn's girlfriend's family is 'out to ruin' Hunt because they disagree with her sexual preference . Grudge: Hunt attended Sebastian River High with the girl, but Hunt's family says the girls family successfully petitioned for her expulsion . Hunt remains allowed to officially graduate with her Sebastian River High School classmates, however. Hunt has been offered a plea deal from the Florida state’s attorney’s office. If she takes it, she'll receive two years of house arrest and a year probation. Without the deal, Florida law says Hunt could receive 15 years in jail and must register as a sex offender. All, says Hunt’s mother, because of her daughter’s ‘mutual consenting relationship.’ ‘They are out to destroy my daughter,’ Hunt Smith told the Examiner. ‘They feel like she “made” their daughter gay. They see being gay as wrong and they blame my daughter. Of course, I see it 100% differently. I don’t see or label these girls as gay. They are teenagers in high school experimenting with their sexuality – with mutual consent. And even if their daughter is gay, who cares? She is still their daughter.’ Deal? A plea deal is on the table for Hunt, offering her two years house arrest and a year probation. Without it, she could face 15 years in jail and life as a registered sex offender . Hunt’s family is now desperate to get the charges against her, which they say will limit her future employment options, dropped. ‘Kaitlyn's girlfriend denies that Kaitlyn ever pressured her and is adamant that their relationship is entirely consensual,’ writes Hunt-Smith. Hunt has received an outpouring of support in recent days. Her story has been told on news sites across the Web and, in addition to the Facebook page dedicated to her plight, Hunt’s family has posted a petition to Change.org urging the Assistant State Attorney Brian Workman to ‘Stop the prosecution of an 18 year old girl in a same-sex relationship.’ ‘Kaitlyn was a highly respected student,’ reads the petition, ‘with good grades and participation in cheer leading, basketball and chorus. She was even voted “most school spirit.” Now she’s been expelled from school and is facing serious felonies - all because she is in love.’ Fair? Hunt has seen an outpouring of support in recent days. A Facebook page is dedicated to her plight, along with a Change.org petition and she's even got 'Free Kate' bracelets .","Kaitlyn Hunt could be forced to register as a sex offender and face up to 15 years in jail in Florida, where the age of consent is 18 .

"By . Jason Groves . Jean-Claude Juncker - frontrunner for the European Commission - said he won't get on his knees to Britain to secure the post, reports suggest . The frontrunner for the presidency of the European Commission says he will not ‘get on his knees’ to Britain to secure the post, it was reported last night. In a bitter attack on the UK, Jean-Claude Juncker also condemned what he described as a British campaign against  his presidency. The former Luxembourg prime minister’s bid for the top Brussels job has been strongly criticised by David Cameron, who warned that the UK could quit the EU if Mr Juncker was to succeed because he is an arch federalist. Mr Cameron has privately branded Mr Juncker a ‘face from the 1980s’ who ‘cannot solve the problems of the next five years’. According to The Guardian, Mr Juncker told a closed meeting of the European People’s Party in the parliament in Brussels yesterday: ‘It is wrong if we give in to the British. 'I will not be forced to get on my knees before the British. What bothers me is the gathering British press campaign.’ Mr Cameron, emerging from a bruising round of talks aimed at preventing Mr Juncker from seizing power, warned last night that Britain will ‘drift towards the exit’ of Europe unless Brussels agrees major reforms. He said Europe could not stick ‘its head in the sand’ and ignore the growing tide of Euroscepticism. His intervention came as Barack Obama issued his strongest plea yet for Britain to remain in Europe – and for Brussels to make the compromises needed to keep the EU together. Speaking at a joint press conference following the G7 Summit in Brussels, the US President said it was ‘hard to imagine’ the EU prospering if Britain left. But he also made it plain the value placed by the US on its old ally retaining a seat at Europe’s top table. Mr Cameron warned last night that Britain will ¿drift towards the exit¿ of Europe unless Brussels agrees reform . He said: ‘With respect to the EU, we . share a strategic vision with Great Britain on a whole range of . international issues, so it’s always encouraging for us to know that . Great Britain has a seat at the table in the larger European project.’ But . he added: ‘It’s hard for me to imagine it would be advantageous for GB . to be excluded from political decisions that have an enormous impact on . its economic and political life.’ Mr Cameron has spent the past fortnight fighting a rearguard action to prevent Mr Juncker’s coronation as president of the European Commission. The Prime Minister clashed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the issue during heated talks in Brussels in the early hours of yesterday morning. Aides described the face-to-face meeting at the British ambassador’s residence as ‘candid’ – diplomatic-speak for a bust-up – but insisted the overall tone had been ‘friendly  and constructive’. Mr Cameron said Europe’s leaders had to listen to voters who backed Eurosceptic parties in record numbers last month. Negitive interest rates were yesterday imposed in Europe in a desperate bid to breathe life into the economy. The European Central Bank cut one of its main interest rates from zero to minus 0.1 per cent. The negative interest rate on bank deposits means commercial lenders will be charged to leave funds with the central bank for the first time. Banks usually receive interest from the ECB on cash they deposit. ECB President Mario Draghi hopes it will persuade banks to lend their money to credit-starved businesses and households instead. It is the first time a major central bank has imposed negative interest rates. The ECB also cut its benchmark interest rate – affecting mortgages and business loans – from 0.25 per cent to a record low of 0.15 per cent. By contrast, the Bank of England yesterday left interest rates at 0.5 per cent, and is expected to start raising them in the next 12 months. The dramatic move in the eurozone was part of a wider ECB attempt to stop low inflation turning into a  dangerous period of deflation. Such an event – seen in Japan over the past two decades – can lead to a downward spiral of lower profits, falling wages and more unemployment. Chris Williamson, chief economist at research group Markit, said: ‘While the Bank of England pulled no  surprises, the European Central Bank went further than expected, taking out a shotgun to hopefully kill off the threat of deflation.’ Negative interest rates have been used in Denmark and Sweden recently. Economist Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, called it ‘a bold and unusual move’, but added that there was ‘considerable uncertainty’ as to how effective negative rates would be. The eurozone economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of 2014 compared to 0.8 per cent in the UK. Growth was driven by Germany, where output was up 0.8 per cent, but was held back by France. Mr Williamson said France, dubbed ‘the sick man of Europe’, is ‘a major drag on the region’s revival’. Eurozone inflation fell to 0.5 per cent, while unemployment remains high at 11.7 per cent. Mr Draghi warned: ‘We are now in a completely different world.’ He outlined a £325billion scheme to boost lending to small businesses and said the ECB could embark on a programme of quantitative easing, or money printing. Carsten Brzeski, an economist at Dutch banking group ING, said: ‘Will it help to kick-start the economy? Probably not. The ECB has no  guarantee that the economy and lending to the private sector can really be kick-started.’ Nancy Curtin, of asset managers Close Brothers, said Draghi ‘didn’t disappoint, throwing in everything but the kitchen sink of QE’.","Jean-Claude Juncker said he will not 'get on his knees' to Britain .

Sgt John Moaney had served alongside the future president in Europe and became one of his closest allies, following him in his later years to his farm in in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Sgt Moaney had the watch for almost 10 years as he worked on the farm for Eisenhower's widow Mamie, until it came into the hands of one of the world's most famous White House collectors. Raleigh DeGeer Amyx rose through the ranks of the FBI, befriending dozens of Presidential staff along the way, and amassed a vast collection of memorabilia. Auctioneer Bobby Livingston told MailOnline: 'Experts think it is the most important Rolex watch ever made' Memorabilia: The watch is part of a vast collection amassed by the late FBI employee Raleigh DeGeer Amyx. Also being sold in the auction this September is Eisenhower's brown leather 1940s flying jacket (pictured) Honour: Eisenhower (left) was given the firm's 150,000th watch after the 100,000th was presented to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (pictured with him right). It commemorated his heroics on D-Day in 1944 . Gift: The President (right) left the watch in his will to former Army colleague Sgt John Moaney, who followed him all the way to the White House and remained with him on his rural farm until his death in 1969 . He bought the watch from Sgt Moaney's widow Delores three decades ago, and it became one of his proudest assets. Now 76, Amyx's Florida home is too small to contain his collection and much of it will now be auctioned off - with the gold wristwatch being the most legendary lot. Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction, told MailOnline: 'We estimate it to sell for one million dollars. 'Experts think it is the most important Rolex watch ever made. 'Rolex in the 1950s was not the brand it is today and from what I understand, the fact that it's hitting the market has made the Rolex community very excited. 'Amex's children aren't interested in the items and he thought it was time to sell them. Many of them are museum pieces which are deserving of proper conservation.' Collector: Raleigh DeGeer Amyx, now 76, wearing the million-dollar watch. Several of his pieces are being sold . Certified: One of the messages written for Amyx by Moaney's widow, who was Eisenhower's personal cook . The auction on September 17 in Boston, Massachusetts, will include several items owned by the president famous for leading the Americans in the D-Day landings. Veterans have marked a solemn 70th anniversary of the bloody assault on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944, which was hailed as the turning point in the Allied fight. As Supreme Allied Commander in . Europe, Eisenhower planned and ordered the landings which were known to . his U.S. troops as Operation Overlord. The first day of the invasion left more than 4,400 Allied soldiers dead, according to research by the U.S. National D-Day Memorial Foundation, much higher than the traditionally-quoted figure of 2,500. But despite the heavy casualties, the operation was seen ultimately as a success, allowing the Allies to deliver the first of a series of fatal blows to Nazi troops on continental soil. The iconic Rolex was an Oyster Perpetual Datejust . chronometer on a Jubilee bracelet, and was presented to Eisenhower for his wartime achievements two years before he was elected president. Commemoration: Memorials are being held to mark 70 years since the D-Day landings, which killed thousands . Deaths: U.S. troops on the Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944. Despite devastating losses, the vast mission allowed the Allies to gain a crucial foothold in occupied Europe during the Second World War . He requested the engraving on the case . back and clasp, which were inscribed with his initials DDE along with . the five-star general symbol. It also bears the date that Eisenhower became the first Supreme Allied Commander under NATO, 12-19-1950. Rolex had made it a tradition to give every 50,000th watch to a prominent figure in the Armed Forces. Swiss General . Henri Guisan was handed the 50,000th chronometer, while Britain's . Winston Churchill was given the 100,000th. After . Eisenhower received the 150,000th they asked him for suggestions . as to who should receive the 200,000th. Both parties agreed General . Matthew Ridgway, who revived the UN's Korean War effort, should receive . it. Other possessions of . the former President to be sold include his Second World War brown . leather flight jacket, which features four-star epaulettes on the . shoulders. A pair of . binoculars given to the President in 1953 will go under the hammer, . along with a painting he made after the war ended of Telegraph Cottage, the small British . home in Kingston, Surrey, where he planned his most audacious . raids. The painting is expected to fetch between $100,000 and $200,000 while the jacket is estimated at $40,000 to $60,000. To be sold: Eisenhower's brown leather flying jacket was worn by him in the early 1940s as he led U.S. troops . Historic: Also going under the hammer will be this painting which Eisenhower made after the war of Telegraph Cottage, the small British retreat in Kingston, Surrey, where he planned his most audacious raids on Europe . Memorabilia: This set of binoculars was presented to the President in 1953 and engraved with his name . Close-up: The binoculars feature the President's name and his title, and were used during his two terms . Other presidents also feature in the auction. Going under them hammer will be the top hat which President Roosevelt wore during his first presidential inauguration on March 4, 1933. A distinctive blue-back wool, satin and velvet cape worn by FDR - along with his walnut cane - will also go under the hammer. The comparatively simple Rolex is almost as expensive as the most expensive commercially available watch in the world, the $1.1million Super Ice Cube by Swiss firm Chopard - which includes more than 2,000 cut diamonds. However, it does not come close to the most expensive watch ever auctioned. That title has been held for more than a decade by the Henry Graves Supercomplication, created for the New York banker of the same name in 1933. Legend has it the banker had a competition with a friend over who could possess the most complicated watch. Other lots: Amyx also owned an unusual black cape worn by President Franklin D Roosevelt . Walking stick: FDR's cane featured in the collection by Amyx, 76, who built it up over several decades . So he commissioned the one-of-a-kind gold timepiece by Patek Philippe, which remained the most complicated watch in the world for more than 50 years. It sold to an anonymous bidder for $11million in 1999, and its whereabouts remained a mystery until it surfaced suddenly in 2012. A member of the Qatari royal family reportedly pledged the watch and other valuables totalling $83million to Sotheby's auction house, to cover outstanding debts.","Wristwatch was Swiss firm's 150,000th after 100,000th given to Churchill .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A grand jury indicted a Florida man for first degree murder on Thursday in the shooting death of an unarmed, black high school student last month after an argument over loud rap music. Software developer Michael Dunn, 46, shot high school junior Jordan Davis, 17, through the window of a sport utility vehicle at a Jacksonville convenience store gas station on November 23, before driving away, authorities said. Dunn, who is white, faces charges of attempted first degree murder for firing at the car which contained three other passengers, all friends of Davis. Tragic confrontation: Michael Dunn, left, has been charged with first degree murder in the November 23 shooting death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis, right, during an argument over loud rap music . Dunn says he opened fire because he saw the barrel of a gun pointed out the back window at him, though police found no weapon . Last ride: Davis was sitting in the back of a red Dodge Durango at the time of the shooting . Dunn was arrested the day after the shooting for second degree murder and pleaded not guilty. He was being held in Duval County without bond awaiting arraignment. The state attorney's office later decided to upgrade the charge to first degree murder, which in Florida requires a grand jury decision. Dunn's arraignment on the new charges is scheduled for December 17.  The Florida Times-Union reported that the State Attorney's Office won't be seeking the death penalty against Dunn. Davis's father, Ron Davis, has pledged to turn his son's shooting death into a crusade against guns and Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law which allows people to defend themselves if they ‘reasonably believe’ someone will hurt them. Widespread opposition to the law has emerged after the shooting of Trayvon Martin, also an unarmed, black 17-year-old, in February by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in central Florida. Zimmerman, whom police initially declined to arrest, will stand trial next June for murder. Tragic: Davis, pictured left and right, was riding in the back seat of an SUV with his three friends after a Black Friday shopping trip when the confrontation happened. The teen's companions were unarmed . Grieving: Davis' parents, Lucia Kay McBath, left, and Ron Davis, right, called on Florida lawmakers to strengthen what they believe to be weak gun laws and repeal the controversial 'Stand Your Ground' legislation . Dunn's lawyer says he fired out of fear for his life when someone in the SUV brandished a shotgun and threatened him. Dunn and his fianceé, Rhonda Rouer, were in Jacksonville on the night of the shooting to attend a wedding when they stopped at a Gate gas station in Baymeadows to pick up  a bottle of wine before returning to their hotel, authorities say. They parked their Jetta next to the red Dodge Durango SUV containing Davis and his three friends - Tevin Thompson, Leland Brunson and Tommie Stornes - who were listening to rap music on their way home after shopping at Black Friday sales at a mall. Dunn asked the teens to turn down the volume of the music, but, his attorney said, the teens turned up the volume, threatened Dunn and brandished a shotgun. Dunn grabbed a pistol from the glove compartment of his car and opened fire, before driving away, authorities say. Police said no weapon was found on the teens. Dunn was taken into custody at his oceanfront townhouse about 170 miles south of Jacksonville the day after the shooting. Dunn's lawyers are considering building their defense on the controversial ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws because they said the teens pointed a gun at Dunn although it was later revealed that there was no weapon in the vehicle. In an interview with WJXT, Dunn’s former attorney, Robin Lemonidis, recounted the 46-year-old man’s account of the incident. Defense: Dunn's attorneys claim that their client felt threatened because he allegedly spotted the four black teens inside the SUV training a shotgun at him . Life lost: Police say Davis was unarmed, and no weapon was found in the SUV where he was riding . According to the lawyer, Dunn heard the teens in the SUV say: ‘Kill that mother******,’ ‘That mother****** is dead.’ Lemonidis said in the next moment, Dunn saw a shotgun coming up over the rim of the heavily tinted SUV containing four black men whose ages he did not know at the time. ‘But he knows a shotgun when he sees one because he got his first gun as a gift from his grandparents when he was in third grade,’ the lawyer said. Davis’ case has been covered extensively by the national media, with MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell dedicating several segments on his Last Word show to the teen’s shooting. ‘Another angry white man in Florida has stood his ground in the face of an imagined threat, and another black 17-year-old high school junior who did nothing wrong is dead,’ O'Donnell said on air in November. The host went on to riduicule Dunn as the ‘self-appointed volume cop of Jacksonvile, Florda,’ who had decided that he had the authority to tell the teenagers to turn down the music. ‘The kids did what most kids would do and what I certainly would have done under the circumstances: nothing,’ O’Donnell said. Speaking on MSNBC’s The Last Word, Jordan Davis’ father urged state lawmakers to toughen gun laws and get the now infamous ‘Stand Your Ground’ legislation repealed. ‘What that is just a shield for people to go ahead and use their firearms without any type of other thought about human life,’ Ron Davis said. Notorious case: George Zimmerman, left, is expected to go on trial next trial for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, right, an armed 17-year-old whom Zimmerman gunned down in February . The teen’s mother, Lucia Kay McBath, argued that it is not up to individuals to decide whether or not a person has the right to use firearms during a confrontation. ‘We’re not saying you don’t have a right to bear arms, because we can’t choose for you what you choose to do. But there needs to be accountability, there needs to be responsibility,’ she said. In states with ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws, 34 per cent of white shooters did not face charges or have not been convicted after shooting a black person, according to an Urban Institute analysis cited by the Huffington Post. Just 3 per cent of black shooters got the same treatment after shooting a white person and making a ‘Stand Your Ground’ claim, according to the same report. And in Florida, which became the first state in the nation to pass laws allowing people to defend themselves rather than back away from a confrontation, justifiable homicides grew by nearly 195 per cent since the law took effect in 2005, FBI data shows.","Jordan Davis, 17, was returning home from a Black Friday shopping trip with his three friends at the time of the shooting .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A Royal Navy patrol ship tracked down and intercepted two Russian landing craft in the English Channel yesterday. HMS Severn, a 1,700-tonne River-class patrol ship armed with three machine guns, headed off the two military vessels sailing east through the Channel. The ship 'closed and tracked' the Russian craft as they, which are thought to have been moving from the Mediterranean back to their home bases. Scroll down for video . Interceptor: The HMS Severn, pictured in Portsmouth Harbour, was sent out to track the Russian craft . A Royal Navy spokesman said that the encounter was part of 'a well-established and standard response'. Navy vessels have met Russian ships in the Channel several times this year already. British forces have also come into contact with the Russians around Nato-controlled waters this month. The HMS Montrose, which was dispatched to the Baltic as 'reassurance', was dispatched amid reports of an unidentified warship. Despite . choppy seas and 30 knot winds, the crew identified the unknown ship as . the 104-metre-long Steregushchiy-class frigate RFS Soobrazitelny . skirting Danish waters as it sailed west in the Baltic Sea. Dispatched: HMS Montrose, a Type 23 frigate, was taking part in a multinational exercise off the Danish coast when she was sent to investigate an unidentified surface ship picked up on radar . Identified: The 104metre-long Steregushchiy-class frigate RFS Soobrazitelny, a Russian warship, appeared to be carrying out routine manoeuvres in international waters . As . HMS Montrose closed with the Russian vessel, a Russian Ilyushin IL-20 . ‘Coot’ maritime patrol aircraft was detected and appeared overhead, . circling the two ships. It was one of the Royal Navy’s most significant encounters with Russian warships in the region since the Ukraine crisis began. Navy chiefs said the show of strength demonstrated Nato’s resolve to protect its 28 members against any threat from the Kremlin. Both the Russian vessel and aircraft appeared to be carrying out routine manoeuvres in international waters. Both incidents continue a series of encounters between British and Russian forces. In May the largest warship in Russia, the Admiral Kuznetsov, was escorted through the Channel by the high-tech HMS Dragon. Bear in our backyard: The HMS Dragon, foreground, escorted the huge Admiral Kuznetsov battle cruiser through the English Channel earlier this year . At the time the Dragon's captain said: 'A Russian task group of this size has not passed by our shores in some time. Cutting edge, extremely capable and very versatile, a Type 45 Destroyer, such as HMS Dragon, is the ideal ship for the job.' When the escort mission - which also involved French and Norwegian ships - took place, Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond pointed out that Russia has been investing heavily in its military in recent years. The observation comes as Western countries slash defence spending. Mr Hammond told journalists: 'Russia is a very significant military power and that is something which all too often seems to get forgotten.' British and Russian military forces have also met in the skies recently. Earlier this month two RAF fighters shadowed seven menacing Russian warplanes that flew too close to Baltic airspace. Tensions: British fighter jets were scrambled to meet Russian forces earlier this month.

"By . Sam Webb . Threats: North Korea has pledged to hold more rocket and nuclear tests after UN-imposed sanctions. Picture shows a North Korean rocket launch from December . North Korea today said it would carry out further rocket launches and a nuclear test that would target the United States, dramatically stepping up its threats against a country it called its 'sworn enemy'. In a statement carried by state media, the top military authority in Pyongyang threatened to wage a 'full-fledged confrontation' against the US for what it calls continued hostility. It comes a day after the UN Security Council agreed to a U.S.-backed resolution to censure and sanction North Korea for a rocket launch in December that breached UN rules. 'We are not disguising the fact that the various satellites and long-range rockets that we will fire and the high-level nuclear test we will carry out are targeted at the United States,' North Korea's National Defence Commission said, according to state news agency KCNA. The statement gave no time-frame for the test and did not explain what 'high-level' test might mean. North Korea is believed by South Korea and other observers to be 'technically ready' for a third nuclear test, and the decision to go ahead rests with leader Kim Jong-un, who pressed ahead with the December rocket launch in defiance of the UN sanctions. If it were to go ahead, this would be . the first nuclear test under Kim Jong-un, who took over the leadership . after the death of his father Kim Jong-il in December 2011. North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009. Washington urged North Korea not to proceed with a third test just as the North's statement was published on Thursday. 'Whether North Korea tests or not is . up to North Korea,' Glyn Davies, the top U.S. envoy for North Korean . diplomacy, said in the South Korean capital of Seoul. 'We . hope they don't do it. We call on them not to do it,' Davies said after . a meeting with South Korean officials. 'This is not a moment to . increase tensions on the Korean peninsula.' U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Policy Glyn Davies after meeting with South Korea's chief nuclear envoy Lim Sung-nam in Seoul today . China, the one major diplomatic ally of the isolated and impoverished North, agreed to the U.S.-backed resolution and it also supported resolutions in 2006 and 2009 after Pyongyang's two earlier nuclear tests. Thursday's statement by North Korea represents a huge challenge to Beijing as it undergoes a leadership transition with Xi Jinping due to take office in March. China's Foreign Ministry called for calm and restraint and a return to six-party talks, but effectively singled out North Korea, urging the 'relevant party' not to take any steps that would raise tensions. 'We hope the relevant party can remain calm and act and speak in a cautious and prudent way and not take any steps which may further worsen the situation,' ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters at a regular press briefing. North Korea has rejected proposals to restart the talks aimed at reining in its nuclear capacity. The United States, China, Russia, Japan and the two Koreas are the six parties involved. 'After all these years and numerous rounds of six-party talks we can see that China's influence over North Korea is actually very limited,' said Cai Jian, an expert on Korea at Fudan University in Shanghai. 'All China can do is try to persuade them not to carry out their threats.' Analysts said the North could test as early as February as South Korea prepares to install a new, untested president or that it could choose to stage a nuclear explosion to coincide with former ruler Kim Jong-il's February 16 birthday. North Korea has been steadily enhancing its missile technology for years . 'North Korea will have felt betrayed . by China for agreeing to the latest U.N. resolution and they might be . targeting (China) as well (with this statement),' said Lee Seung-yeol, . senior research fellow at Ewha Institute of Unification Studies in . Seoul. The North was banned from developing missile and nuclear technology under sanctions dating from its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Any nuclear tests would be the first under North Korean leader Kim Jong-un . A South Korean military official said the concern now is that Pyongyang could undertake a third nuclear test using highly enriched uranium for the first time, opening a second path to a bomb. North Korea's 2006 nuclear test using plutonium produced a puny yield equivalent to one kiloton of TNT - compared with 13-18 kilotons for the Hiroshima bomb - and U.S. intelligence estimates put the 2009 test's yield at roughly two kilotons. North Korea is estimated to have . enough fissile material for about a dozen plutonium warheads, although . estimates vary, and intelligence reports suggest that it has been . enriching uranium to supplement that stock and give it a second path to . the bomb. According to . estimates from the Institute for Science and International Security from . late 2012, North Korea could have enough weapons grade uranium for . 21-32 nuclear weapons by 2016 if it used one centrifuge at its Yongbyon . nuclear plant to enrich uranium to weapons grade. North . Korea gave no time-frame for the coming test and often employs harsh . rhetoric in response to U.N. and U.S. actions that it sees as hostile. Its . long-range rockets are not seen as capable of reaching the United . States mainland and it is not believed to have the technology to mount a . nuclear warhead on a long-range missile. The . bellicose statement on Thursday appeared to dent any remaining hopes . that Kim Jong-un, believed to be 30 years old, would pursue a different . path from his father Kim Jong-il, who oversaw the country's military and . nuclear programmes. 'The . UNSC (Security Council) resolution masterminded by the U.S. has brought . its hostile policy towards the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea . (North Korea) to its most dangerous stage,' the commission was quoted as . saying.'","Military says test and rocket launches aimed at the US, its 'sworn enemy'

"By . Sean Poulter . Ostrich meat kebabs are being added to the barbecue range at hundreds of high street stores. Tesco is putting the free range ostrich meat on sale in 400 locations amid evidence the nation is developing a taste for exotic and unusual meat. Just last Christmas, Lidl was offering reindeer steaks and claimed it was unable to keep up with demand, while the discount chain Budgens has previously put squirrel on its shelves. New bird: For those looking for something unusual for this summer's barbecues, ostrich meat is set to become widely available in UK supermarkets . It is possible to buy Llama mince, imported from Chile, on Amazon plus many other exotic choices, ranging from Zebra steaks, to crocodile, kangaroo, camel and elk, from specialist suppliers. Tesco is pushing the 300g packs of Mossel Bay ostrich kebabs for £5 on special in-store promotional displays. Details were revealed in The Grocer magazine, which said the fast rising discounters are also following the latest food trend. Aldi will offer ostrich kebabs in September and Lidl plans to have ostrich meat on its shelves this Christmas. The kebabs at Tesco are supplied by wholesaler DB Foods, which said a trial of Mossel Bay ostrich steaks at Britain’s biggest supermarket in March had gone ‘very well’. There are some ostrich farmers in the UK, however the meat being sold by Tesco comes from South Africa as the result of an exclusive deal with a farmer co-operative called Mosstrich. Fresh meat: Tesco is putting the free range ostrich meat on sale in 400 locations amid evidence the nation is developing a taste for exotic and unusual meat . Tesco buyer Megan Kent said that speciality meats were increasingly popular with customers adding: ‘These ostrich kebabs are perfect for a summer barbecue.’ DB Foods is already supplying more than 2,000 High Street butchers and Whole Foods Market with the kebabs and chief executive Ben Bayer said that ostrich was set to become increasingly visible to consumers. He said: ‘It is our ambition to see ostrich become a mainstream meat. It’s nutritional, has a great taste and is a healthy red meat.’ Ostrich is a particularly healthy red meat, coming in at just three per cent fat, compared to around 10.5per cent for beef, 15.2per cent pork. It even has less fat than chicken, which is typically 7.4per cent. Historically, there have been animal welfare concerns about the farming of ostriches, particularly when it was carried out in the UK, amid concerns the climate was too cold and wet. Similarly, there were concerns that the birds should not be reared in intensive crowded conditions where they were kept under cover in barns and so were unable to run around and enjoy a natural existence. Mr Bayer, who said his company is in talks to supply other retailers, dismissed animal welfare concerns raised when the meat was sold in the UK in the 1990s. ‘We have worked closely with Mosstrich on animal welfare,’ he said. Claire Nuttall, partner at branding agency Thrive Unlimited said that to grow interest in a speciality meat, suppliers needed to generate awareness of dishes where the meat made a tangible difference. ‘Or they need to demonstrate another benefit, such as price, health or ethics, to make the meats feel like more than a one-off curiosity,’ she said.","Ostrich meat for the barbecues this summer available in the UK .

"By . Rebecca English . and Martin Robinson . Prince Philip has met his great-grandson for the first time at Balmoral after he was flown on a private jet with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have chartered a private jet to take Prince George to meet his great-grandfather for the first time. The future king's first flight was in a £14million Cessna 750 to Scotland yesterday afternoon, so he could go to see Prince Philip at Balmoral. Renting the jet would normally cost up to £12,000 a day, but it is owned by the billionaire Duke of Westminster, Prince William's godfather, who is understood to have loaned it to them. Royal sources told MailOnline the trip 'would not cost the taxpayer'. After landing at Aberdeen, eight-week-old George was taken to Balmoral, the Queen’s private Highland estate, to meet the 92-year-old royal. The Cambridges may stay in Scotland until the end of the week, and William, who is on his first holiday since leaving the armed forces last week, is likely to unwind by going deer stalking. Charles and Camilla are at their nearby home, Birkhall. Philip was the only senior royal not to have met the third in line to the throne. At the time of George’s birth he was recuperating at Sandringham after an abdominal operation. Arrival: Prince William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, land at Aberdeen Airport yesterday . Now George is at Balmoral, there is a rare opportunity for a unique family photo to be taken. For the first time in more than a century, three generations of heirs to the throne are alive: Prince Charles, 64, Prince William, 31, and newborn George. The last time such a picture was taken was in 1894 when Queen  Victoria was photographed with her son Edward VII, grandson George V and great grandson Edward VIII. It is believed the Royal family will take a commemorative portrait to mark three generations of direct heirs to the throne being alive at the same time . Busy week: After stepping out last Thursday with William, the Duchess skipped a weekend wedding in Norfolk, no doubt so she could get everything in order for the trip to Scotland with her child . A royal insider said: ‘Everyone has . been waiting for this photo to be taken, and of course the Duke of . Edinburgh has been looking forward to seeing his great-grandson. 'It’s wonderful that the family have finally got together.’ William and Kate flew to Scotland after the prince attended the wedding of friend James Meade to Lady Laura Marsham in Norfolk on Saturday. Kate had surprisingly stayed in London where she was spotted shopping for baby clothes in Sloane Square.","Prince George flown to Scotland with Duke and Duchess of Cambridge .

"For ice fisherman looking to quench their thirst and warm their bodies in frozen conditions, a drone delivering beer seemed like the perfect idea. But now the FAA has ruled Lakemaid Beer, based at Steven's Point, Wisconsin, can no longer operate their test aircraft to deliver beverages to fishermen, after raising safety concerns. Lakemaid, which calls itself 'the fisherman's lager', had hoped to use the pilotless aircraft to potentially deliver drinks to thousands of anglers trying their luck in icy conditions.

A video showing the brewers testing out the idea on Lake Waconia went viral after it was posted last week and has now gathered 85,000 views. But the government ruled that the company's next test, which was set for Minnesota's Lake Mille Lacs and the Twin Pines resort cannot proceed. 'We were a little surprised at the FAA . interest in this since we thought we were operating under the 400-foot . limit,' said Lakemaid managing partner Jack Supple via email to npr.org via email. He added that the beer-makers 'figured a . vast frozen lake was a lot safer place than [what] Amazon was showing on . 60 Minutes.' In December, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos revealed his company's plans to use drones for same-day delivery. Served cold: Lakemaid wanted to develop a way of delivering the beer based on a person's GPS coordinates . But the FAA rules do not allow drones to be used for commercial delivery, although it has scheduled a review. Following the publication of Lakeland's viral video, the FAA contacted the firm to say it broke numerous regulations, ranging from the operator's rating to the use of airspace. Although disappointed, Supple understands the FAA's concern. 'Drones whizzing around piloted by any knucklehead is probably not the . Jetsons future we all imagined.' In a statement to Breitbart.com, he added: 'They think it’s a great idea, though they’re telling me to stop.' There are also other issues with the idea that need to be worked out, including checking buyers' ids to ensure that they are not underage and developing drones that can carry a 12 pack further than half a mile.

Trudy Nelder, who claimed to be a single mother when she was really living with her husband, says she is too ill to complete the 200 hours of unpaid work she was handed as a punishment. The 42-year-old was given the option of a curfew instead, but when she argued that this would also interfere with caring for her children, it was  limited to weeknights. Nelder, from Cheltenham, falsely claimed £40,294.79 from the state between January 2009 and August 2011, when she failed to tell the Department for Work and Pensions she was living with her husband. She claimed that she was a single mother with no income – but her husband had a job with Cheltenham Borough Council. In February last year, a judge gave her a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. He did not send her to jail in recognition of the fact that she had to take care of her six children, but warned that any further problems would result in automatic prison time. He also ordered her to do 200 hours of unpaid work. But Nelder has now had her sentence changed, claiming that an operation she had in October left her too ill to do the work. Instead, she was given a curfew, but even that has now been scaled down because she claimed it would not fit conveniently with caring for her children, who are aged between 11 and 21. Recorder Michael Gibney said that her illness was a ‘realistic reason’ to reconsider the sentence. He agreed that the 7.30pm to 7am curfew, which will run for three months, should only apply from Monday to  Friday because of the ‘exceptional circumstances’. Nelder said  that a curfew would not be convenient because she needed to care for her children, aged 11-21 . Nader claimed that she was a single mother and that she did not work. Despite the fact that she lived with her husband who works at Cheltenham Borough Council (pictured) Recorder Michael Gibney, at Gloucester Crown Court, said it was a 'realistic reason' to reconsider the sentence and said he would impose a curfew on the mother of six instead . However, he warned her to be careful: ‘You need to be aware this court has taken a lenient approach.’ When . Nelder was originally sentenced last year, Recorder Michael Selfe told . her: ‘You have admitted to stealing £40,000 of public money. ‘You knew perfectly well what you were doing and you carried on until you were caught.’ He . added: ‘I have considered a custodial sentence may have an impact on . the care of children, but there is a limit to how far you can rely on . problems with child care. I have, however, come to the conclusion I can . suspend this sentence and you should understand that if you commit any . further offence of any sort you will go to prison immediately.’ The court heard that Nelder had told police her husband was a violent man and she wanted a divorce. Joe Maloney, defending, said Nelder’s husband was controlling and she was looking after the children on her own. He said: ‘She has no previous convictions and is in a financial mess. She is already being threatened by bailiffs. ‘She is in debt and she has just buried her head in the sand on this.’","Trudy Nelder, from Cheltenham, claimed £40,294 between 2009 and 2011 .

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . Labour will struggle to win a majority in the general election because UKIP’s  success has ended the  traditional two-party system, one of its senior MPs warned yesterday. Former Cabinet minister Peter Hain also admitted that many voters ‘don’t see’ Ed Miliband as a prime minister. His comments came as shadow ministers warned traditional working-class Labour voters were abandoning the party for UKIP, which resonated with them more. Peter Hain, the former Cabinet minister, has announced that he is standing down at the next General Election but also although Ed Miliband will be PM, UKIP will prevent a Labour majority . Mr Hain, who is standing down at next year’s election, said that it was likely that Mr Miliband would be in No 10 after the election, but did not know if the party could win a majority. The Neath MP said  voters would realise Mr Miliband was the right person to lead the country once he was in Downing Street – ‘even if they don’t see that at the moment’. He added: ‘Whether we’ll have a majority, which I will fight for along with every other Labour Party member, I don’t know because it’s very, very hard to win a majority now in British politics because we’re not in a two-party system, which we had for generations. We’re in a multi-party system. ‘Ed . Miliband is well placed to lead the government in the future and I think . people, when they see him as prime minister, will actually realise that . they’ve elected the right person, even if maybe they don’t see that at . the moment.’ after . Labour’s recent run of poor election results, work and pensions . spokesman Rachel Reeves warned that senior Labour figures that . blue-collar supporters felt UKIP understood their fears better. She said campaigning had shown her that support for the party was falling in safe seats. Yesterday's men: Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown with Mr Hain in the days when they were in office . Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (left) believes that Labour should not seek to mimic UKIP to steal their votes while Rachel Reeves (right), work and pensions spokesman, says that the working class  think Labour no longer represents theme . ‘Traditional voters, who perhaps at times we took for granted but had nowhere else to go, are now being offered an alternative by UKIP,' she added. ‘Our voters – if I can still call them that – see UKIP offering a vision and a hope that things can be better. They hear something that resonates with them and with their fears for the future and that’s something very real that we have to contend with. ‘The Labour Party came into existence to give a voice for ordinary working people. ‘I saw middle-class, public-sector, well-educated young graduates voting Labour – but the people who the Labour Party was set up to help abandoning us. ‘Our very raison d’etre will be threatened if the working people who the Labour Party have got to be a voice for start to drift  away because they don’t see us as the answer.’ But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper warned that the party should not seek to mimic UKIP to steal their votes. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘We can’t imitate UKIP, we have got to take them on.’","Mr Hain says we are now in a multi-party system .

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . Warning: General Sir Peter Wall has warned against any further defence cuts after the next election . Britain should not make any further cuts to its Army after the next election, its chief argues today. In an attempt to draw a line under cost-savings, General Sir Peter Wall says most of the change is ‘now behind us’. The Chief of the General Staff says that after such ‘significant changes’ he is confident the Army’s new slimmed down structure ‘will endure’. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Sir Peter lobbies against even deeper cuts in next year’s defence spending review. Defence chiefs fear that spending may fall below the two per cent of GDP that Britain has pledged to its Nato allies. Sir Peter stresses that Britain still needs ‘well-trained, well-equipped units with committed soldiers ready to deploy at short notice, who can adapt quickly and intelligently to unforeseen situations’. A strong Army is needed to give the government ‘genuine choices in a crisis’, he adds. The 2010 defence review will lead to the loss of 20,000 regular soldiers by the end of the decade as eight per cent of the Ministry of Defence budget is cut. The Navy will lose 6,000 sailors and the RAF 8,000 airmen. Sir Peter’s intervention comes as a former head of the Royal Navy yesterday said the Government’s cuts to its fleet have gone too far and are a ‘national disgrace’. Lord West of Spithead, a former first sea lord, said yesterday the coalition had not just cut to the bone but ‘into the bone’, as he insisted the UK had been left with too few ships to escort naval convoys. The Labour peer also warned the possibility of Scottish independence poses the greatest security and defence threat to the UK. Asked about the scale of today’s navy, Lord West told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I believe we’ve cut into the bone... it’s not to the bone, but into the bone and I think we’ve gone too far.' The 2010 defence review will lead to the loss of 20,000 regular soldiers by the end of the decade. File photo . He added: ‘A great maritime nation like us, where we still run global shipping from London and we’re totally reliant on that, those sinews that keep the global village together, to have 19 escorts I think is a national disgrace actually. ‘And I think we really do need to think very, very hard about that because we have a very dangerous and chaotic world. ‘If you look at the LNG (liquefied natural gas) carriers, every 20 hours from Qatar to Milford Haven there is an LNG carrier - 13% of our gas supplies in this country. ‘If you stop that we suddenly have not got any power and that’s just that. There’s the same for food and all these other things.’ Turning to the possibility of Scottish independence, Lord West said: ‘The greatest grand strategic threat to the security and defence of our islands is the possibility of Scotland separating. ‘This is a really, really serious issue. There is no doubt whatsoever that if Scotland separated it would diminish our ability to defend these islands.’ He added he did not blame anyone for this situation potentially emerging.","General Sir Peter Wall warns against any further cuts after vote next year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A law passed by King Henry VIII 500 years ago could force villagers to foot repair bills for their parish church, despite rarely stepping inside the ancient building. Three homeowners from sleepy Humbleton, near Hull, East Yorks, have been caught out by the archaic legislation, which states that they are legally obliged to fund repairs costs at St Peter's Church. The original 'chancel repair liabilities' rule dates back to the 1530s and was altered by Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. The local Parochial Church Council of St Peter's Church, in Humbleton, East Yorkshire, has issued letters to residents informing them they are liable to pay for the church's upkeep, withing days of the law expiring without such a warning . When people bought land taken from monasteries, they became 'lay rectors' and had a duty to help repair their local church. The government looked to abolish the law 10 years ago and gave churches a decade, until October 13 this year, to register properties for chancel repair liability with the land register otherwise they would not be able to make a future claim. With just three weeks before that 10-year deadline passes, and the local parochial church council has issued letters to people whose properties have historical liability to upkeep the church. Homeowner Mick Wood, whose farmhouse is less than 600 yards away from the church, said: 'It's utterly terrifying to know that if anything goes wrong with the church, we would be asked to cough up. Churches were unlikely to be able to make claims against residents using the law from Henry VIIIs realm (pictured), unless they registered all liable properties by October 13 . 'It's an open cheque book and could bankrupt us if anything serious goes wrong. 'We feel victimised and angry. It is such an old law and one that should be quashed. 'We want to pass the house on to our children for another 100 years. Our children are the future of this village, but the church certainly won't be getting our support.' Chancel repair liability relates to the historic responsibility for the upkeep of a church being divided between the rector and parishioners.Parishioners' responsibilities were eventually transferred by legislation to the church. Rectors have historically remained responsible for the upkeep and when their lands were sold, responsibilities were transferred to the new landowners. These lands need not necessarily be adjacent to church property. Under the Chancel Repairs Act 1932 a Parochial Church Council (PCC) has the power to serve a demand for the cost or contributions for repairing the church chancel. In the event that the owner fails to pay then the PCC can enforce the demand through the courts. Around one third of parish churches may be entitled to recover cost of repairs from neighbours who own all or part of church's historical land. Finding out if a property sits on former church land and therefore carries this responsibility can be timely due to National Archive data checks. Legislation in place since 2003 has given PCC's until October 13, 2013 to register chancel repair liability against affected properties, which should then be informed. According to Acces Legal, its lawyers understand that any PCC's which fail to register properties and inform owners by October 13, 2013, will not be able to make claims against them. However, according to a the Legal Advisory Commission of the General Synog, churches may be able to make claims even if they have not registered liable properties. It states: 'But even if the liability is not registered within the ten-year period (Oct 2003-Oct 2013), it will still be enforceable after the expiration of that period against the owner of the land until he or she disposes of it.' Cindy Parsonage, 49, found out she was subject to the historic chancel repair liabilities rule by letter from the Parochial Church Council of St Peter's - and is now desperately looking for a way out of it. Cindy, whose home is closest to the church, said: 'I am terrified as it just doesn't seem fair - I don't even go to the church. Churches need work all the time. How am I going to afford that?' Cindy bought her house in Fitling Road seven years ago and was unaware of the law - neighbour Mick inherited the hall, which has been in his wife's family for more than 80 years. Due to the size and amount of land on Mick's property, he is liable to pay up to 50 per cent of costs. The law only came to light in 2003 when married couple Andrew and Gail . Wallbank were told they had to pay £100,000 to fund repairs of their . ecclesiastical parish's medieval church at Aston Cantlow. When they tried to challenge the . demands, the Law Lords found in favour of the Parochial Church Council, . leaving the couple with a £350,000 bill including legal costs. They also had to pay a further £36,000 to ensure they were not liable in future. The Government then passed legislation to amend the law, giving churches a 10-year window to register properties, otherwise losing rights to make claims. The roof was replaced at St Peter's Church ten years ago but no claim to the lay rectors was made because the church was unaware of the law. A church council spokesman said: 'We knew it was potentially going to upset some people. We didn't want to alienate those who support us but, at the same time, we had to follow instructions from the diocese in our duty to the church.' There are currently 15,000 parish churches across England and Wales, with 5,200 of them potentially having nearby residents responsible for funding repairs of the chancel of the church. Currently, the government advises new land purchasers to carry out checks as to whether they would be held responsible for repair costs. From next month, chancel repair liability will only bind buyers of registered land if it is referred to on the land register.","Some residents in Humbleton, East Yorkshire, have just been informed by their local church authority they are liable for the chancel upkeep costs .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Having beer on tap was once a distant dream for many. But the rise of the Kegerator – a combination between a keg and a refrigerator – has meant that freshly poured, draught beer is being enjoying in homes across the country. The concept was born out of the DIY skill sharing community when those desperate for beer on tap found ingenious ways to get it by re-engineering their fridges. Scroll down for video . Wisconsin-based Nostalgia Electronics is offering its ‘Kegorator Beer Keg Fridge’ for around $600 (£360).  The pressurised system claims to keep beer carbonated for weeks and even has a portable unit features rolling casters to move it to any party location . And it quickly caught on commercially. For instance, Wisconsin-based Nostalgia Electronics is now offering its ‘Kegorator Beer Keg Fridge’ for around $600 (£360). The pressurised system claims to keep beer carbonated for weeks and even has a portable unit with rolling casters to move it to any party location. ‘Simply place a keg of your favourite brew in the refrigerated chamber and plug in the unit. To dispense the beverage, just pull the tap’s lever,’ the company wrote. Kegs for the fridge cost an average of £70 ($117) for 12 litres - or 21 pints. This works out at £5.80 ($9.75) a pint, which means users will pay slightly more than in a pub or bar. To get beer out of the keg, gas pressure is applied to the top surface of the liquid, which presses the beer from the bottom of the keg up through that metal tube and out of the valve. For those who want something more, California-based Dream Arcades has gone one better by creating the $5,000 (£2,970) Kegerator Pro 60. The device comes with built-in fridge, a keg with three taps, and more than 140 classic video games. The arcade also has a massive 60-inch HDTV screen . The in-built refrigerator keeps beer fresh by storing and serving it between -1 and 7°C (30-45°F). For those who want something more, California-based Dream Arcades last year created the $5,000 (£2,970) Kegerator Pro 60. The device comes with built-in fridge, a keg with three taps, and more than 140 classic arcade games. The arcade also has a 60-inch HDTV screen. ‘Players never have to stop the action to refill their drink’ the company said in a statement. The arcade also has two built-in cup holders ‘so players can keep their drinks topped off while keeping one hand on the joystick.' As . temperatures rise, it is the perfect way to keep your beers cool - and . not have to make the long trek to the fridge when you need a refill. A Danish firm has unveiled an underground beer fridge that can be sunk into the garden. It takes advantage of cooler underground conditions to keep beer chilled. Called the eCool, it sinks 24 beers underground. When beers are removed, the next is automatically pushed to the top using a pulley system. The entire system, which is just over a metre in height, is sunk underground. 'It’s advised to use a garden drill, but can be installed with a shovel as well, if you’re a real man,' the firm says. It says the system is ideal for eco-friendly beer drinkers as it uses no electricity. 'Do something great for yourself and the environment. 'It’s easy to install in the garden or terrace, and uses no electricity. 'With the eCool you can always drink a cold beer with good conscience. The earth cooler is 113 cm in height, 22-30 cm in diameter and weighs 12 kg. It holds 24 cans and can stay installed the whole year.","Nostalgia Electronics has created the home Kegorator Beer Keg Fridge .

"By . James Chapman . Ed Miliband will today concede that Labour will not be able to reverse any of the Coalition’s spending cuts unless they are fully funded by budget reductions elsewhere. After three years of opposing almost every one of the Government’s attempts to bring down public spending, the Labour leader will risk disappointing core supporters by declaring that if  he wins the next election he will not borrow more to undo any of them. However, Labour is still committed to borrowing billions more in order to fund spending on infrastructure projects, such as roads and power stations, and a temporary VAT cut. Leader of the Labour Party Ed Miliband has confirmed that he would not reverse the current Government's austerity measures . Mr Miliband’s intervention comes ahead of Chancellor George Osborne’s latest spending review, due on Wednesday, in which he will announce budgets for Government departments for 2015/16. Yesterday Mr Osborne said that in 2015/16 the Treasury expects to take in £660 billion in taxes but on current plans expects to spend £745 billion. He added: ‘The difference, nearly £90 billion, is made up  of borrowing. ‘My job is to bring down that deficit so this country starts living within its means.’ Mr Osborne said the welfare bill for 2015 would be slashed by a further £3 billion, and insists another £11.5 billion of savings must be identified. Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne said that in 2015/16 the Treasury expects to take in £660¿billion in taxes but on current plans expects to spend £745¿billion . Higher education, local government . and defence are among the areas facing further cuts as it becomes clear . that austerity measures will have to go on longer than planned even if, . as the Chancellor hopes, the economy is now recovering. Labour leader Mr Miliband, addressing . his party’s National Policy Forum today, will seek to toughen its image . on the economy after a series of polls showing it is still trailing the . Conservatives on the issue. Miliband added that everybody in the Labour Party, including Ed Balls, should be clear about where the money is coming from . ‘We won’t get to choose the circumstances of the next Labour government,’ he will say. ‘If we win the election, we will come to power in tougher economic circumstances than we have seen in generations, and that will have to shape the way that we govern. ‘Our starting point for 2015/16 will be that we cannot reverse any cut in day-to-day, current spending unless it is fully funded from cuts elsewhere or extra revenue – not from more borrowing. ‘So when George Osborne stands up next week and announces his cuts in day-to-day spending, we won’t be  able to promise to reverse them because we can only do so when we can be absolutely crystal clear about where the money is coming from. ‘It’s a hard reality. But I am clear . about it, [Shadow Chancellor] Ed Balls is clear about it, and everyone . in the Labour Party should be clear about  it too. ‘People will only put their hope in us if we show how we will make a difference. ‘But people will only put their trust in us if we show we are credible. Only if we have the discipline to face the challenge of our times can we change the direction of our country.’ Mr Miliband will also claim the nascent economic recovery is being enjoyed only by people at the top. He will say: ‘It certainly feels like a recovery for those at the top, but it still feels like a recession for everybody else: wages down, prices up, living standards falling for longer than they ever have in our history.’","Has opposed almost all of the Government's attempts to reduce spending .

"By . Mark Prigg . The Federal Communications Commission has launched a major probe into why US consumers often suffer with slow internet connection while watching online video. The inquiry announced by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will dissect the routes that video and other data travel to reach Internet service providers such as Comcast and Verizon. Netflix and other critics have accused the two Internet service providers of deliberately slowing incoming traffic from websites unwilling to pay for a less congested entry point. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler today pledged to unravel the mystery behind the Internet traffic jams bogging down the delivery of Netflix videos and other online content. Comcast and Verizon contend Netflix should bear some of the cost for handling the heavy traffic caused by its 36 million U.S subscribers watching video over high-speed Internet connections. At peak viewing hours, Netflix accounts for about one-third of the Internet traffic in the U.S., according to the research firm Sandvine. The picture quality of Netflix video, though, has been increasingly erratic during the past year at several major Internet service providers, including Comcast and Verizon, which have a combined 30 million subscribers in the U.S. While Netflix has been streaming more smoothly at Comcast since those two companies forged their partnership in February, some problems have still been occurring on Verizon's network. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has continued sniping at both Comcast Corp. and Verizon Communications, arguing they should be able to afford to deliver whatever online content that their subscribers want, given that their customers pay $50 to $80 per month for their Internet service. Netflix charges $8 to $12 per month for its Internet video service. With the FCC inquiry, Wheeler hopes to get a better understanding of how Netflix and other websites are reaching the Internet service providers through interconnection, or 'peering,' arrangements. 'The bottom line is that consumers need to understand what is occurring when the Internet service they've paid for does not adequately deliver the content they desire, especially content they've also paid for,' Wheeler said in a statement. Netflix's most recent ISP speed chart revealing the fastest and slowest providers. It has accused providers such as Comcast and Verizon of throttling its service. In the process, the FCC also could shed more light on whether Netflix is saving money in its peering deals with Comcast and Verizon. Although the terms of the partnerships haven't been disclosed, both Comcast and Verizon have suggested Netflix is paying them less for a direct connection to their network than what it previously cost Netflix to deliver video through other intermediaries. In a rare show of unanimity, Netflix and Comcast both said they welcomed the FCC's inquiry in the interests of greater transparency. Verizon reaffirmed its support for the status quo and pointed out that 'Internet traffic exchange has always been handled through commercial agreements.' The tensions over peering arrangements is part of a much larger debate over Internet neutrality, the concept that all online traffic should be treated equally so service providers can't set up a system that gives special preference to their own content or websites willing to pay for privileged access. The FCC's previous guidelines for so-called net neutrality were scrapped by a federal appeals court in January, requiring Wheeler to draw up new rules. Wheeler's initial blueprint for net neutrality raised fears that he was going to empower Internet service providers to charge for toll roads, a fear that Wheeler has sought to quell in his public statements. Kevin spacey in house of Cards: the huge popularity of Netflix shows has caused problems for some providers who claims there is too much traffic. Now regulators plan to find out exactly where the bottleneck is. Peering deals haven't been considered to be part of net neutrality, but Hastings is pushing for interconnection to become part of the equation. Hastings' critics believe he is seizing an opportune time to publicly skewer Internet service providers in an attempt to eliminate all peering fees and boost Netflix's earnings. He has been escalating his attacks while Comcast has been trying to win government approval of its politically sensitive $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable, another major Internet service provider. Hastings is urging regulators to reject that deal on the grounds that it might make it even easier for Comcast to impose Internet tolls on content providers. Former FCC Commissioner Michael Powell, now president of National Cable & Telecommunications Association, blasted Netflix and other unnamed Internet companies for trying to 'move the goal posts' to suit their own interests. 'They want to protect their profits by ensuring that the disproportionate impact caused by delivering traffic to their customers is spread across all broadband subscribers and not just those who actually use the service,' Powell wrote in a blog post earlier this week.","Aims to solve mystery behind the Internet traffic jams .

"By . Rosemarie Lentini . A two-year outbreak of salmonella poisoning which has infected more than 130 people, half of them children, is believed to be caused by pet bearded dragons. At least 132 people in 31 states have fallen ill since February 21, 2012, including 55 who were hospitalized. Most of the victims were children aged under five whose parents likely bought the Australian native lizards from pet stores, according to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. Authorities have traced the infection back to a range of breeders who may have kept the reptiles in unhygienic conditions before selling them to pet shops. Outbreak: A recent spate of salmonella infections in the US have been linked to bearded dragons, lizards native to Australia (pictured) The . culprit is salmonella Cotham, a rare strain of bacteria that can cause gastroenteritis and, more seriously, sepsis and meningitis. In some cases, the disease can resist antibiotics. Jim Nesci, a reptile education expert . based in Chicago, Illinois, told CBS News the bacteria is caused by the . environment which pet owners create and is not inherent to the animal. He said breeders and pet owners should clean the reptile's cage and change the water regularly to avoid disease. 'The biggest problem is the way . people keep stuff. If they keep it filthy and they handle the . animal, it's a problem,' Nesci, who has owned reptiles since 1952, said. 'It's called hygiene you can't let your . animal live in c**p.' NBC News reported a cluster of cases tied to pet reptiles was first reported in Wisconsin in January. Since . 2012, 12 people in that state were sickened by the rare strain and 10 . of them reported contact with bearded dragons, an analysis showed. According to the CDCP report, a laboratory investigation isolated the outbreak strain from samples from a pet bearded dragon and its habitat collected from an ill person’s home in Oregon. Infection: Salmonella Cotham is a rare strain of bacteria that can cause serious illness in the very young, the very old and people with poor immune systems. Public health agencies have traced back the outbreak to a range of pet stores in the US . This is not the first time the rare bacterial disease has been linked to bearded dragons. NBC News reported that in 2011, CDC officials warned about an outbreak when a home cook who kept pet lizards made turkey gravy that sickened 19 people at a Thanksgiving dinner. Last year, there was a spate of outbreaks that linked transmission of salmonella to pet turtles. Bearded dragon owners have been advised to keep their pets away from food, drinks and bathrooms, and to disinfect any surfaces the lizards touch.","Outbreak hit 31 states between February 21, 2012 and April 21 this year .

Instead he is pinning his hopes on ‘shoring up’ Labour’s traditional working-class vote and declaring his own class war by smearing the ‘toxic Tories’ as rich and out of touch. The damaging disclosures are contained in a leaked copy of Labour’s General Election strategy sent to all Labour shadow cabinet ministers. Headed Political Strategy To 2015, it sets out how Mr Miliband plans to win power. But it also confirms claims by Labour MPs that the party faces an uphill struggle because voters find Mr Miliband and his views a big turn-off. One shadow minister said: ‘This document admits the awful truth that nearly four years after Ed became leader, people don’t trust him on the three things that worry them most: immigration, the economy and welfare. We aren’t even bothering to  try to appeal to the majority of people. It is a counsel of despair.’ Mr Miliband’s secret plan is revealed under the heading The Political Context Underpinning Our Strategy. It says the top three issues that would-be Labour voters care about are ‘economy, immigration and the NHS’ – and Labour’s ‘weaknesses are immigration, social security and [public] spending’. Labour's battle plan that they hope will win them the 2015 General Election . The document also makes a  mockery of Mr Miliband’s public denials that he has given up trying to win over Middle England voters who helped Tony Blair’s landslide win in 1997 and hopes to scrape  into power by appealing only to the Labour faithful, about 35 per cent  of the public. Confirming Mr Miliband’s secret so-called ‘35 per cent strategy’, it states: ‘Our solid lead in the national vote share, 35 per cent, is reflected in a solid lead in battleground seats, 37 per cent. This would give us a majority of 44 at the elections. To shore up our position, we want to gain an additional 3-5 per cent of the vote.’Tony Blair won the 1997 Election with 43 per cent of the vote. Ed Miliband faced fresh pressure last night after one of his closest allies warned that he was failing to win over voters. Labour MP John Denham – an ex-Cabinet minister who helped Mr Miliband win the party leadership before serving as his Parliamentary aide – warned voters ‘do not believe that they are in any story that Labour is telling about the future of this country’. Devastatingly Mr Denham added: ‘If they are not part of our story, I don’t know what the Labour Party is for.’ His outspoken remarks form part of a growing chorus of dissent over the direction of Mr Miliband’s leadership. Mr Denham backed Rachel Reeves (right) – Labour’s work and pensions spokesman who warned earlier this month that the party was being deserted by its traditional supporters in favour of UKIP because Labour was taking them ‘for granted’. He told a political seminar: ‘If you went to many of the people that Rachel brilliantly described, they don’t believe that they are in any story that Labour is telling about the future of this country. They can list lots of other people that they think are in Labour’s story, but not them.’ Mr Denham went on: ‘It’s not a matter of having a policy for this or for that, but actually including them legitimately in the story and saying you are part of the people that we’re here for. If they’re not part of our story I don’t know what the Labour Party is for.’ Yesterday, former Labour Cabinet Minister David Blunkett, who is standing down in 2015, warned the party would be out of power until 2030 if Mr Miliband loses the Election because the Conservatives would bring in changes to exclude Labour. A Blairite Labour MP said: ‘The language in this document is shocking. To talk of shoring up our vote underlines the extent of our crumbling support. 'Miliband says he is a One Nation leader while admitting he is only seeking the support of a third of the nation. 'Nor should he be talking about toxifying the Tories. We don’t need to resort to smears, we need constructive popular policies if we want to win and win well. It’s hopeless, we can’t go on like this.’ The Labour document, written before the recent European and local elections, also states: ‘Our target voters care about: 1) immigration; 2) NHS and 3) growth. When growth is bundled with other economic issues, the priorities in order of importance to these voters are: Economy; Immigration; NHS. ‘The Tories will try to frame  the Election in terms of our  weaknesses: immigration, borrowing and benefits.’ The document says Labour’s tactics must be to ‘neutralise our weaknesses on immigration, social security and spending’. Mr Miliband pledged last week to boost benefits for older jobless while scrapping them for young adults in middle-class families. The Tories claimed it would push up welfare bills. The document also says Labour must ‘toxify more of the same under the Tories’, focusing on the ‘living standards crisis, youth unemployment, NHS in crisis and “the top running away with it” ’, a reference to Labour claims that the Prime Minister and Chancellor help only the rich. The Conservatives said the Labour document was ‘an admission that they have lost the argument and are resorting to lies’. A Labour source said: ‘Ed is an effective campaigner and we have popular policies, including a freeze on energy bills, a guaranteed appointment with your GP and moves to get 200,000 homes built every year. We are in a position to win next May.’","Mr Miliband believes he has no hope of winning over new voters .

"By . Hugo Gye . Gender stereotypes are not yet a thing of the past as a new survey reveals that many people still have strong opinions on which jobs are suitable for men and women. Two-fifths of Britons believe there are some jobs which women should never do, including soldier, mechanic and surgeon. A similar proportion think that men are unable to do some jobs properly, such as beautician, florist and nurse. At work: But many Britons still believe that women should not carry out jobs such as being a builder . The survey of 2,000 British adults carried out by mobile payment service WorldPay Zinc revealed that two-thirds of people think men make better plumbers, mechanics and electricians than women. Just three per cent think that women are better pilots and surgeons than men, even though there is no evidence for this. And women are just as likely to stereotype their own sex as men are - only two per cent think they are better at technical jobs than men, with 21 per cent saying men are better. Conversely, men are assumed to be worse at traditionally 'feminine' jobs such as primary school teaching. Some 64 per cent of Britons say women are better florists, 76 per cent say women are better nannies, and only three per cent believe that men make better nurses. Survey: This graph shows that people still ascribe traditional gender stereotypes to certain careers . Charlotte Keene, 25, from Egham, Surrey, who has been a gas engineer for six years and has now started her own company, Gas Girl, said: 'There has been a lot of gender discrimination in my career so far. 'Training was tough and people assume I won't be as good as a male engineer. I've been so stressed about this at times that I nearly threw the towel in. 'But instead of giving into the stereotypes, I saw a gap in the market - lots of women feel safer letting me into their home than they would a man. The study was carried out on November 4 by research agency Vision Critical which conducted an online survey of 2,026 British adults from consumer panel Springboard UK. It found that many people said they would not trust a professional because of their gender, with 19 per cent insisting they would not trust a male nanny, 18 per cent would not trust a male beautician and 16 per cent would not trust a man working as a midwife. Distrustful: Many people said they would not accept the likes of male midwives and female mechanics . Meanwhile, while five out of six Britons would be happy being treated by a male nurse, 11 per cent would feel uncomfortable and five per cent would demand to be seen by a female nurse instead. 17 per cent of people said they would be annoyed to see a female mechanic working on their car - and two per cent would leave the garage in this situation. Shockingly, three per cent of Britons said that if they found out that they were about to fly on a plane piloted by a woman, they would refuse to board, get off the plane or make an official complaint. Geraldine Wilson, managing director of WorldPay Zinc, said: 'We're disappointed to see that their lives may still be blighted by these outdated stereotypes. 'Our service is designed to help businesses of every sector, whether they are run by men or women. 'And while our study suggests there is still a way to go before we are able to achieve equality in the workplace, attitudes are changing for the better.'","Two-fifths believe there are some jobs which women should never do .

"By . Bianca London . It may be home to the world's greatest tennis stars but Wimbledon has become more of a red carpet this week. The annual tennis tournament, which kicked off on Monday in South West London, has drawn in the A-listers day after day.

She wore strappy black wedges and carried a £200 Matryoshka clutch, opting to cover up in a £300 tailored white blazer. Staying true to one of her favourite brands, the author and party planner wore full CH Carolina Herrera with her dress, clutch and blazer all being by the Venezuelan-American fashion who has dressed the likes of Michelle Obama. Sibling day out: Kate clearly decided to stay at home with baby George while her siblings Pippa and James opted for an afternoon of tennis . She and James took their seats in the Royal box just behind Downton Abbey actress Michelle Dockery. Other . notable guests included Prince Frederik and Princess Mary of Denmark, .

Rowe, Eddie Seaward, a former groundsman who retired in 2012, Canadian . journalist Clive Thomson and Mr Lloyd and Mrs Soraya Embley.

Middleton - or that bridesmaid's dress which brought her so much . attention at the Royal Wedding in 2011. Miss . Middleton was interviewed by Today's Matt Lauer who had flown to London . to speak with her for a two-part segment to be aired on Monday and . Tuesday.

In . 2012, it was reported that NBC would offer Pippa, a freelance writer . and party planner, $600,000 to be a royal correspondent but this was . denied by the network.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A day after being berated in court by her husband, Shelly Sterling returned to the witness stand Thursday in a trial to determine whether she has the right to sell Donald Sterling's Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion. Mrs Sterling said her husband encouraged her to sell the team for the best price after the NBA banned him from the league for life for making racist remarks. She moved quickly to get bids and kept her husband informed daily, she said in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Claims: Shelly Sterling, pictured with her husband Donald at a Clippers game, told a court he encouraged her to sell the team . Testify: Donald Sterling's wife Shelly Sterling arrives at a Los Angeles court on Tuesday to discuss the sale of the Clippers . When she reported that former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer had offered $2 billion, Donald Sterling became excited and said she had done a good job, but within days his mood changed, she said. He became enraged in a conversation, cursed her, said he would never sell the team and would sue the league, she testified. Mrs Sterling also defended the deal she unilaterally made with Ballmer - which would be a record price for an NBA team - and said she believed the sale would prevent disaster for the Clippers. Mrs Sterling said she feared players and sponsors would start a boycott if her husband held on to the team. Donald Sterling contends that his wife had no right under a family trust that owns the Clippers to singlehandedly make the deal. Denied: Sterling, pictured in 2010, told the court his wife had no right to sell the team . Unexpected: Sterling, who had Alzheimer's diagnosed, told his wife 'Stay away from me you pig' during the hearing . In earlier testimony, two doctors hired by Mrs Sterling to examine him declared that the 80-year-old had Alzheimer's disease and was mentally incapable to act as administrator of the trust. In his own testimony this week, Donald Sterling shouted from the witness stand that he would never sell the team. On Tuesday, he alternately declared his love for his wife of 58 years, and then demeaned her as a woman intimidated by the 'bad NBA' and incapable of handling such a large financial transaction. Before taking the witness stand, he kissed her. But on Wednesday, he yelled 'get away from me, you pig!' when she tried to approach him after her first day of testimony. The judge told Sterling his comments were 'somewhat distrurbing' and said: 'Please don't make any comments about your wife.' Outside of court, Ballmer's lawyer Adam Streisand told USA Today: 'It was a shameful display by a seriously demented tyrant, ... his outburst, yelling at his wife ... was just hideous.' Couple: Shelly has been married to Donald Sterling for 58 years . Deal: Former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer has made a record bid to buy the Clippers . Bobby Samini, who is representing Sterling, told the paper that 'emotions were really high'. 'I . know that Donald felt very upset by watching her testimony. I think he . felt betrayed by it. Obviously not a happy time for him,' Samini said. NBA owners are scheduled to vote on . the Ballmer deal next Tuesday. It's also the day that Ballmer's offer is . set to expire - and there is no deal without the judge's approval of . the sale. If the sale isn't completed by September 15, the league said it could seize the team and put it up for auction.","Shelly Sterling told court Donald had encouraged her to sell team .

"By . Bianca London . Forget the Maldives or even Ireland a la Kim Karadashian and Kanye West, two festival fanatics are celebrating life as newlyweds at Glastonbury. Jack and Bianca Vaughan tied the knot in the local town of Glastonbury before arriving with the rest of the revellers at the iconic music festival in Somerset. The couple from Reading gazed longingly into each others eyes and walked hand in hand through the sun-drenched fields last night. Scroll down for video . Just married: After marrying in the town of Glastonbury, Jack and Bianca Vaughan from Reading arrive at the same time as thousands of others ahead of the Glastonbury Festival . Bianca was still wearing what looked like her lace wedding dress, which she teamed with white Hunter wellington boots. Jack, however, had changed (we hope) into a grey T-shirt and shorts, which he wore with a pair of trainers. The loved-up pair joined the rest of the crowds as the music festival gathered pace last night. Come rain or shine, every year the most fashionable - and questionable - of festival goers descend upon Glastonbury for a weekend of well-dressed debauchery. Lovers: Jack and Bianca, who was still wearing her dress, made their way through the crowds at the iconic music festival last night . Casual groom: Jack, however, had changed (we hope) into a grey T-shirt and shorts, which he wore with a pair of trainers . Mind your dress! Luckily Bianca packed her Wellies, which are sure to come in handy if this weekend's weather forecast is anything to go by . How romantic: The loved-up duo walked off into the sunset on the first night of the hotly anticipated music festival . Not only is Glastonbury the world's most . iconic music festival, it is also a catwalk for celebrities and the . bands' glamorous groupies to showcase their style credentials for all . the world to see. Glastonbury may have a . reputation for mud and rain, but as one of the . summer's first festivals, it's also a key indicator of what looks will . pass muster at the rest of the summer's musical events and gatherings and which are better left in the soggy fields of Somerset. Some . looks never go out of fashion - like the perennially popular Hunter . wellingtons, quilted Barbour jackets and floral crowns - and this year . also saw an explosion of neon and 90s grunge as ravers made some serious . sartorial effort. FEMAIL has rounded up the good, the bad and the downright bonkers styles on day one of Glastonbury. You're welcome. Here comes the bride! No one batted an eyelid as the newlyweds made their way through the crowds . All hail festival fashion! Who needs denim shorts and some wellies when you can dress up as an astronaut and a pair of nuns like these revellers, who opted for fancy dress to enjoy the sunset at the stone circle on day one of Glastonbury Festival . Attention to detail: One diligent festival goer ensured that he had every inch of his body inked, wore some bling on his nipples and even treated his toe nails to a colourful pedicure ahead of the iconic music event . Aladdin, is that you? A man who has clearly taken some serious style inspiration from the Disney cartoon relaxes in The Green Futures Field at Glastonbury Festival . Waiting for your UFO? An astronaut sits pensively on the stone circle at the festival, which kicked off last night . Having a fancy old time: A group of lads showed off some leg as they dressed up in their Pacman outfits . Can you see where you're going? Two revellers embrace the fancy dress theme in a skeleton and union jack morph suit . But first, let me take a selfie: A group of well-dressed girls arrive in denim hot pants and converse, which have fast become festival fashion essentials . Taking the bull by the horns: Thousands of revellers flooded through the gates of the Glastonbury Festival as the biggest event in the music calendar got underway today . Anything goes in Somerset: It seems that bunbags are making a comeback from the 90s if these eclectically dressed revellers' outfits are anything to go by . Bottoms up!

"By . James Slack . Serial criminals with more than 100 convictions are routinely escaping with a slap on the wrist, it emerged yesterday. Extraordinary new figures reveal that in the past year alone, 1,079 of the country’s most prolific offenders were spared a jail term by courts. Soft justice is being handed out to criminals guilty of even some of the worst crimes. New figures reveal that in the past year alone, 1,079 of the country's most prolific offenders were spared jail . In one shocking case, a burglar being sentenced for his 65th offence was given another chance – despite having a history of crime stretching back 50 years. In total, 2,583 burglars with 15 or more previous convictions were let off with a fine or other community punishment last year. Similarly, 1,970 people found guilty more than 15 times of violence against the person also escaped prison. For all offences – including robbery and sex crimes – some 112,700 people with more than ten convictions avoided a jail sentence in 2013. Incredibly, this included 8,500 offenders who had already been punished on 50 previous occasions. The figures caused alarm in Whitehall and risk creating new tensions inside the legal system. A senior Government source said: ‘We have always been clear that prison is the right place for people who deserve to be there, and if that’s not where they are ending up, we have to make sure we know why not.’ Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the figures underline why we have set about toughening the justice system . The research provides fresh confirmation of how Britain’s justice system is failing to rehabilitate the criminals responsible for the majority of crime in England and Wales. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘These figures underline why we have set about toughening the justice system, including scrapping repeat cautions and make sure community sentences have a proper element of punishment. 'By the end of this Parliament we will have 3,000 more adult male prison places than we inherited in 2010, even though we have been dealing with severe financial pressures. 'It is also why we have made tackling reoffending a central part of our strategy for the criminal justice system.’ More than half a million crimes each year are committed by those who have broken the law before. 'But despite successive governments repeatedly tinkering with the justice system, reoffending rates have been largely static for a decade. Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre For Crime Prevention think-tank, said it was ‘extremely dangerous’ to give soft sentences to prolific criminals. ‘Judges could have prevented a huge number of crimes by giving these hardened criminals longer sentences,’ he said. ‘Even after they are released, criminals who go to prison for two years or more reoffend less than those who get community service or a shorter sentence. ‘If judges think there isn’t the capacity to lock up more serious, repeat offenders, the answer is to build more prison places, not more soft justice.’ Reoffending is said to cost the country up to £13billion a year. Ministry of Justice figures show that the highest reoffending rates are for prisoners serving less than 12 months. At present they receive little or no support on release and 60 per cent quickly break the law again. From next year, those offenders will be put under mandatory supervision in the community for 12 months after release. Prisons minister Jeremy Wright admitted that there was a ‘persistent hardcore of offenders being recycled’ round the justice system. He said the Government was seeking to tackle reoffending by ‘transforming’ rehabilitation.","Soft justice is being handed out to criminals guilty of worst crimes .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Four U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration employees saw or heard a handcuffed San Diego student locked in a cell for five days without food or water, but did nothing because they assumed someone else was responsible, investigators said on Tuesday. The Justice Department's inspector general faulted several DEA employees for their handling of the April 2012 incident that left Daniel Chong in grave physical health, cost the agency a $4.1 million settlement and led to nationwide changes in the agency's detention policies. The employees told investigators they found nothing unusual in their encounters with Chong and assumed whoever put him in the cell would return for him shortly. A government investigation has found that four U.S. DEA employees saw or heard handcuffed college student Daniel Chong while he was held in a San Diego cell for five days without food or water . Chong, then 23, ingested methamphetamine, drank his own urine to survive and cut himself with broken glasses while he was held. A three-page summary of the investigation does not say when the four employees encountered Chong or what they heard or saw, and the DEA wouldn't elaborate. The agency declined to say if any employees faced consequences, calling it an 'ongoing internal disciplinary matter.' Chong was handcuffed behind his back without access to a toilet. He has said he slid a shoelace under the door and screamed for attention before he was found covered in his feces. He said he used a shard from his broken glasses to try to carve a 'Sorry Mom' farewell message on his arm but only managed to finish an 'S.' Payout: The college student who was taken to county jail and subsequently forgotten for five days, settled with the Department of Justice Tuesday for $4.1 million last July . Chong, a student at University of California, San Diego, was detained in a drug sweep and told after brief questioning that he would be released. Last year, he reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the federal government over what his attorneys called a near-death experience. The Justice Department's inspector general found the DEA's San Diego office didn't have a system to track detainee movements, that holding cells were not equipped with cameras and that an employee assigned to monitor cells had many other responsibilities. Employees were not required to sign in or out of the detention area, and there were no reliable electronic entry records because the door lock wasn't working. Left alone: Mr Chong was arrested in April 2012 as part of a drug bust, but was told he was going to be released . There was no DEA policy or training regarding operations of holding cells at the time and no requirement that holding cells be checked at the end of each day. The inspector general faulted three case agents  one a DEA employee and two assigned to an agency task force - and one supervisor who were responsible for Chong's safety. It said the supervisor exercised poor judgment and violated DEA policy by assigning two of the agents to process evidence from the cell after Chong was found. Investigators also faulted DEA management for launching an investigation into Chong's detention before alerting the inspector general, a violation of DEA and Justice Department policies that they said could have hampered any criminal prosecution. The DEA is part of the Justice Department. The DEA said Chong's case prompted new nationwide policies for handling detainees that largely mirror the inspector general's recommendations . The DEA said Chong's case prompted new nationwide policies for handling detainees that largely mirror the inspector general's recommendations. 'The DEA is confident that these measures will help to prevent similar incidents in the future,' the agency said in a statement. Julia Yoo, an attorney for Chong, said she was 'gratified that the investigation seems to be thorough' but called on the inspector general to release the full report. She said Chong was still in school in San Diego and 'doing well.'","Government investigation has found that four U.S. DEA employees saw or heard handcuffed college student Daniel Chong in April 2012 .

"Jurors in the murder trial of Gerard Baden-Clay have been warned about seeking outside assistance during deliberations after one downloaded information on jury deliberations from the internet. Supreme Court Justice John Byrne recalled jurors from their deliberations on Thursday, two hours after they had retired to consider a verdict. The judge said a juror had apparently downloaded material on how a jury might approach deliberations. Brisbane man Gerard Baden-Clay wanted to 'wipe the slate clean' at the time his wife Allison Baden-Clay, pictured together, disappeared in April 2012 . 'What was done is wrong. I am however grateful that what has happened has been drawn to my attention,' he told the seven men and five women. Jurors retired to consider their verdict at 11.10am (AEST) on Thursday, on the 18th day of Baden-Clay's trial. The former real estate agent has pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife Allison in April 2012. Her body was found on a creek bank at Anstead in Brisbane's west on April 30, 2012, ten days after her husband reported her missing from their home in nearby Brookfield. Baden-Clay has pleaded not guilty to murder and the prosecutor at his trial told jurors they might think it 'highly unusual' that Baden-Clay cut himself shaving in a way that looked like fingernail scratches or that Allison's blood was found in the couple's car . During the trial, prosecutors said the father of three probably smothered his wife at their house and dumped her body where it was found under the Kholo Creek Bridge. Baden-Clay's defence team has argued she could have taken her own life or died accidentally after wandering off at night. The trial heard from 75 witnesses, including Baden-Clay's former mistress Toni McHugh and Queensland MP Bruce Flegg, who knew Baden-Clay and lived near him. Allison's parents Geoff and Priscilla Dickie also gave evidence, while recorded police interviews with the couple's three children were played in court. Details of Baden-Clay's multiple affairs, his financial woes and Allison's history of depression were laid bare during more than four weeks of proceedings. The judge is expected to finish his summary on Thursday morning before the jury retires to consider its verdict .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Once upon a time, a couple planted a rare shrub in their front garden. For eight years, nothing happened until – lo and behold – it suddenly sprouted into this 20ft monster dubbed the Giant Beanstalk. The agave Americana is already higher than its owners’ bedroom window and its amazing growth shows no sign of slowing. Sharon McMullan from Paignton, Devon, with a 30ft flower spike that has grown in her front garden . The agave Americana is already higher than its owners' bedroom window and its amazing growth shows no sign of slowing . Sharon McMullan, 54, and her 66-year-old husband Bill bought the plant at a garden centre. It remained dormant for years, producing nothing but spiky green leaves. But following a series of mild winters, it has unexpectedly burst into life – producing the towering stem in a matter of weeks. Mrs McMullan, a grandmother from Paignton in Devon, said: ‘The flower prong is nearly as tall as the house. You can see it getting taller on a daily basis. 'It’s outside the bedroom window now and it doesn’t seem to have stopped yet. For years the plant remained dormant, producing nothing but spiky green leaves . But following a series of mild winters, it has unexpectedly burst into life - producing the towering stem in a matter of weeks . ‘We’re a little bit worried it could fall down in a storm and land on a neighbour’s car. 'But my grandchildren love it – they call it the Giant Beanstalk.’ She added: ‘I haven’t done anything special, I wouldn’t say I’m much of a gardener.’ Agaves – which are native to Mexico and used to make tequila – flower only once before the  plant dies. During the flowering, a tall stem or ‘mast’ grows from the centre of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of short  tubular flowers. A spokesman for the Royal Horticultural Society said:  ‘Normally they would be happier in hotter climates such as Spain or Portugal but mild winters here are protecting them and allowing them to flourish.’","Sharon McMullan, 54, and husband Bill, 66, bought plant at garden centre .

"By . Becky Barrow . Young women aged between 18 and 24 are going broke twice as fast as young men, it was revealed yesterday. And experts say many women are building up debts they cannot repay to pursue a celebrity lifestyle. They are buying designer clothes and other expensive goods as they try to emulate the rich and famous. New figures from the Insolvency Service show how among the under 35s, women are more likely to go bust than men . Reality TV star Kerry Katona last year filed for bankruptcy for a second time in five years while Martine McCutcheon was also declared bankrupt last year . The scale of the financial problems facing women emerged yesterday in official figures on personal insolvency. They . highlight an extraordinary social change in Britain from a time when an . insolvent woman in her 20s was a rarity to today’s debt explosion. Aggressive advertising campaigns by payday loan companies which encourage women to spend on luxuries also came in for criticism. The . Insolvency Service’s figures show that last year 7.8 women aged 18 to . 24 became insolvent for every 10,000 adults compared with a rate of 4.0 . for men. More women than men . were also going bust in the 25-34 age group, although the difference . was not so stark. The personal insolvency rate for women was 32.8 per . 10,000 adults last year, while for men it was 25.6. The . figures, for England and Wales, show that around 14,730 women aged 18 . and 34 were overwhelmed by their debts last year, compared with around . 10,950 men. The gender gap is most striking in the South West, where almost 14 in 10,000 women aged under-25 are insolvent, compared to 5.5 for men . High profile . young women who have been unable to pay their debts include former . EastEnders actress Martine McCutcheon, declared bankrupt last year, and . the singer Kerry Katona, who last year filed for bankruptcy for the . second time in five years. The . figures also show that when all age groups are taken into account women . are for the first time just as likely as men to become insolvent. For . every 10,000 adults 22.6 men became insolvent last year. For women, the . figure was virtually identical at 22.2. In 2009, the insolvency rate . for men was 35.5 per 10,000 adults, whereas for women it was 26.0. Yesterday . experts predicted women will ‘beat’ men of all ages within a few years, . a dubious landmark for those whose grandmothers were not even allowed . to take out a mortgage in their own right. Louise . Brittain, a council member for the insolvency professionals’ trade body . R3s, said the larger numbers of young women going insolvent compared . with men is in part likely to be a hangover from the pre-credit crunch . era when people were making their incomes stretch further by taking out . credit. ‘I think it is the . differences in spending patterns nowadays for that age group,’ she said. ‘Lifestyles have changed a great deal in the last 20 years.’ She . also suggested that celebrity culture may be having some influence on . spending habits, with people trying to imitate a lifestyle few can . actually afford. Seaside struggle: Coastal areas suffer from higher insolvency rates, the new research suggests . Experts say changing lifestyle patterns and a hangover from the financial crisis mean young women are more willing - and able - to take on debts . The 10 local authorities with the highest personal insolvency rates across England and Wales in 2013, with the rate per 10,000 adults: . 1. Torbay, 47.2 . 2. Denbighshire, 43.0 . 3. Blackpool, 40.8 . 4. Scarborough, 40.6 . 5. Mansfield, 40.4 . 6. Halton, 40.2 . 7. South Kesteven, 39.8 . 8. Hull, 39.6 . 9. Stoke-on-Trent, 39.5 . 10. Cannock Chase, 39.3 . David . Rodger, chief executive of the Debt Advice Foundation, said: ‘The credit . landscape is changing rapidly, with marketers becoming a lot more . targeted and using mobile, social media and online advertising to . promote borrowing and spending. Payday and other short-term lenders are . working hard to look more responsible.’ He . said the rise in female insolvency is ‘the inevitable outcome of the . expansion of credit marketing’, adding: ‘Taking out credit is now . perceived as a right, with the responsibilities pushed to one side.’ Personal . insolvencies are made up of bankruptcies, debt relief orders and . individual voluntary arrangements, where money is shared out between . creditors. Many go for IVAs, which were established in 1986 as an alternative for individuals wishing to avoid bankruptcy. They . are a formal repayment proposal presented to a debtor’s creditors via . an insolvency practitioner and are seen by many as an option that does . not attract the same stigma as a bankruptcy hearing. The . increase in female insolvency has also been fuelled by the introduction . of debt relief orders in 2009. They are only an option for people who . have debts of less than £15,000, who have almost no assets, who cannot . pay their debts and who have no prospect of their situation improving.","7.7 in 10,000 women under-25 declared insolvent, compared to 4 for men .

"By . Leon Watson . With his cute whiskers and glossy fur, he looks as gentle and benign as could be. When he’s not indoors being petted by his owners, you’d probably expect Shiny the tom to be playing in the garden, perhaps chasing the occasional bird. But things aren’t quite so perfect  in the Cornish village of Little Treviscoe, where he lives. Mean face: Shiny the four-year-old male cat who has terrorised the neighbourhood of Little Treviscoe, St Austell . Neighbours say Shiny is terrorising . the area and have branded him ‘devil cat’. Police have been called five . times over his violent behaviour, which has left locals and their pets . in need of medical treatment. They want the four-year-old cat to be put down. His owners, however, insist he is innocent and the injured must have done something to provoke him. Police . are powerless to act because laws designed to combat dangerous dogs . don’t apply to cats. Paula Burton was taken to A&E in July after . Shiny ran into her home and sank his claws into her arms and legs. The . 42-year-old had bruising and cuts that required antibiotics. She . said: ‘He was hanging off my arm by his claws. He eventually let go and . ran away but I had to go to hospital as my arm had become quite . swollen. I love cats and I’d never normally complain – but this animal . is out of control.’ Neighbour . Carol Ballsdon said Shiny clawed her 90-year-old mother. She said: ‘She . had a large skin tear down the arm, which we had to dress every day for . three weeks, and two big puncture wounds on the back of her leg. It is . just four sets of claws and a set of teeth coming at you.’ Another local said she used to use water to shoo Shiny away but has also had to throw hot tea over him. Vicious: The injuries sustained by Paula Burton who was attacked by Shiny . Ouch: The injuries sustained by Helen Wade's cat (left) and those sustained by Julia Terry's cat (right) Julia . Terry, 43, said: ‘It launched off the fence and attached itself to my . arm. I had to throw hot tea over it.’ Shiny has also laid into cats and . dogs, costing owners vets’ bills. Helen Wade’s elderly cat was attacked a couple of weeks ago by Shiny and was left with gaping cuts. The . 34-year-old carer said: ‘We’re living in misery – he’s like a devil . cat. We’ve had a fence and a gate put in our front garden to try and . stop him coming in, but he persists. ‘The . laws need to be changed so the same rules apply for cats as they do . dogs. If a cat attacks a person, they should be put down.’ Terrifying: Shiny has been branded Britain's most ferocious feline after  putting residents and pets in hospital . Watch out! Two-year-old Poppy (left) with Shiny, who has terrorised the neighbourhood of Little Treviscoe, and (right) Shiny, looking malevolent . Shiny’s . owners Mandie and Adrian Knowles, who live in the village with their . three children, have had him since he was a kitten. They say they had . Shiny neutered after Miss  Burton was attacked. Mrs . Knowles, 32, a learning support student, said: ‘I know people had . problems with Shiny before but since he’s been neutered we’ve seen no . signs of violent behaviour. ‘He’s . an outdoor cat but will come inside and have his food around our . two-year-old Poppy – we’ve never had any issues with our children. These . people must have done something for him to act that way. He wouldn’t . attack them out of the blue. ‘We’ve . had the police knocking on our door about five times, and have had the . RSPCA here – it’s getting ridiculous. The RSPCA found no problem with . Shiny.’ Her 34-year-old . husband, a dispatch supervisor, said: ‘It’s getting unfair on Shiny.

"By . Gerri Peev . Safe seat: Euan Blair (pictured on his wedding day) is said to be targeting one of Labour's safest seats, Bootle, in the next general election . Euan Blair is targeting one of Labour’s safest seats for the next general election, it was reported last night. The ambitious 29-year-old, son of Tony Blair, is believed to have his eye on Bootle, Merseyside, just a stone’s throw from his mother Cherie’s childhood home. She was raised in Waterloo, north of the tough Bootle patch which Labour holds with a majority of more than 21,000. Bootle’s 81-year-old Labour MP, Joe Benton, has vowed to stand again for the seat in 2015. But he is fighting de-selection and has already lost at least one ward. Labour HQ is considering throwing the seat open to a formal selection contest at the end of next month. The former prime minister’s son could find himself grappling for the seat with the incumbent MP – who has held the position for 24 years – as well as local council leader Peter Dowd and other activists. Labour would have to sidestep its default all-women shortlist system to allow Mr Blair and other men to run. He had been interested in the Coventry seat of former paymaster general and Gordon Brown ally, Geoffrey Robinson. But the young would-be MP was seen off by Mr Robinson, who was re-selected by colleagues. Mr Blair lives with wife Suzanne, whom he married last year, in a £3million home in central London, which he jointly bought with his mother. He is believed to have quit his lucrative job at investment bank Morgan Stanley to focus on building his political career. But he caused controversy by working for the Republicans in Washington. A Labour source said the idea of the ‘heir to Blair’ taking the Bootle seat would be a ‘disaster’. The source told the Liverpool Echo newspaper: ‘There’s no way Labour is going to lose Bootle, but the idea of parachuting someone like Euan Blair in would be a disaster, a joke.’ But the 29-year-old’s trump card could be his mother’s close ties to the area. She was even rumoured to be seeking the seat herself 12 years ago and served as Chancellor Emeritus of Liverpool John Moores University. Mrs Blair has often spoken of her pride . in coming from Merseyside and said she was inspired to become a QC by . local heroine Rose Heilbron, one of the first women to be appointed a . Queen’s Counsel in the UK. Childhood home: The Bootle constituency is just south of Waterloo, where Euan's mother Cherie was raised . Current Bootle MP Mr Benton, who is currently in Strasbourg, could not be reached for comment. But a spokesman said: ‘He is seeking re-selection for the 2015 general election and Bootle Constituency Labour Party has started the usual process that every sitting MP seeking re-selection will face. ‘The process began just last week and the outcome won’t be known until each ward and affiliated organisation has met, which will take several weeks.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘The Labour Party standard re-selection procedure for sitting MPs has begun in Bootle. A result is expected on May 30.’ Mr Blair is one of three ‘Red Princes’ – heirs of Labour politicians – to seek seats in recent months. Stephen Kinnock, son of former party leader Neil Kinnock, is the candidate for the safe seat of Aberavon in South Wales. Will Straw, whose father is former foreign secretary Jack Straw, is running in Rossendale and Darwen, while former deputy prime minister John Prescott’s son David is eyeing up a London seat.","Tony and Cherie Blair's eldest child is following in his father's footsteps .

"By . Gerri Peev . Criticised: Lord Mandelson has been accused of acting like a 'Kremlin lackey' by agreeing to attend an economic conference in Russia . Lord Mandelson has been accused of acting like a ‘Kremlin lackey’ by agreeing to attend an economic conference in Russia. The former Labour minister is on the list of those expected to be at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in two weeks. David Cameron, the White House and the Labour Party have all called for a boycott of the business event amid concerns about Russia’s aggressive stance on Ukraine. It has been dubbed Vladimir Putin’s ‘vanity summit’. Andrew Foxall, a director of the Russia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said Lord Mandelson risked being seen as a ‘Kremlin lackey’ who was  ‘jeopardising’ Britain’s attempts to isolate Russia’s economy. The former business secretary, who also served as an EU trade commissioner, is down to attend in his capacity as chairman of Global Counsel LLP, an advisory firm. The former Cabinet heavyweight praised President Putin at last year’s summit for his ‘intelligent and strong’ economic leadership. Also among those listed as attendees this year are Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, and executives from Johnson & Johnson, and Pepsi. They will rub shoulders with bosses from Russian firms such as Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil. Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire who entertained Lord Mandelson on his superyacht in Corfu when the politician was an EU commissioner, is also on the guest list. The pair’s relationship came under scrutiny after aluminium tariffs were waived by Brussels for Mr Deripaska’s Rusal firm. Concern: David Cameron (pictured), the White House and the Labour Party have all called for a boycott of the business event amid concerns about Russia's aggressive stance on Ukraine . Both men denied any wrongdoing in the deal. Mr Deripaska recently footed part of the bill for the Sochi Winter Olympics, amid international condemnation of the Kremlin’s crackdown on gay rights. Lord Mandelson did not respond yesterday to requests for a comment. Yesterday in Ukraine, pro- Russian separatists in east Ukraine ignored Mr Putin’s public calls to postpone a referendum on independence, which many fear could spark a full-blown civil war. Separatist leaders in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk want to split from the Ukraine. Russian President: The economic conference has been dubbed Vladimir Putin's (pictured) 'vanity summit' Denis Pushilin, leader in Donetsk, said: ‘Civil war has already begun. The referendum can put a stop to it and start a political process.’ Mr Putin has called for the vote to be delayed to allow further talks with Kiev. He has also ordered  Russian troops to pull back from the border with Ukraine. Some analysts believe the president knew that separatists would defy his call to postpone the votes. By making his demands public, Russia could distance itself from criticism that it is stoking unrest. Moscow has vowed to protect  the rights of Ukraine’s large Russian-speaking population. It describes the government in Kiev as undemocratic.","Lord Mandelson criticised for agreeing to attend Russian conference .

In his press conference yesterday, President Barack Obama said that there was 'overwhelming evidence' Syrian President Bashar al-Assad carried out a chemical weapons attack against rebels in the suburbs of Damascus on August 21. What he didn't mention was that his administration knew about the alleged nerve-gas attack three days before it happened. At a U.S. intelligence briefing Friday afternoon, senior administration officials disclosed that there were indications three days prior that an attack was coming.

What he didn't mention is how intelligence officials knew about the attack before it happened . 'In the three days prior to the attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were association with preparations for a chemical weapons attack,' the U.S. intelligence report released by the Obama administration said. At the briefing, officials would not answer of whether or not they warned rebel forced before the attack. But at least two opposition members told Foreign Policy magazine that they had no idea the attack was coming. Dishad Othman is a Syrian activist and secure-communications expert living in the U.S. He says his opposition contacts in Syria had no warning before the chemical weapons attack. 'If you knew, why did you take no action?' Othman asked. Razan Zaitouneh, another opposition member who lives in one of the towns affected, said she too knew nothing about the oncoming attack. 'It's unbelievable that they did nothing to warn people to stop the regime before the crime,' she said. Questions: Members of the Syrian opposition questioned why the U.S. didn't warn them an attack was coming if they knew about it three days before it happened . The U.S. intelligence report concluding that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons against it's own people on August 21 was based on 'a substantial body of information' including satellite imagery, intercepted communications and social media reports around the time of the attack . 'Our high confidence assessment is the strongest position that the U.S. Intelligence Community can take short of confirmation,' the report said. 'We will continue to seek additional information to close gaps in our understanding of what took place.' One of those gaps seems to be whether the order was executed at a high level within the Syrian military, or if it was carried out by a rogue military officer. One of the reports confirming the attack happened came from a phone call intercepted by the U.S. between a panicked Syrian Minister of Defense and the leader of a chemical weapons unit. The minster was demanding answers for the strike which could be evidence that it wasn't directly orderd by President Assad. Nevertheless, in his speech yesterday, President Obama said he is holding President Assad responsible. The U.S. has determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack on a suburb of Damascus on August 21. The chemicals weapons used a nerve-gas agent which caused it's victims to asphyxiate. Intel says that 426 children were among the attack's victims. Innocents: According to U.S. estimates, of the 1,429 killed in the attack, 426 were children . An assessment conducted by British intelligence estimates a much lower death toll of 350 people. But President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are confident that the attack happened and that any military action in the country won't be like the 2003 invasion of Iraq for so-called 'weapons of mass destruction.' 'We will not repeat that moment,' Secretary Kerry said. Which is why President Obama announced yesterday that the U.S. 'should take military action' even before U.N. inspectors have finished their investigation. Weapons inspectors left Syria yesterday and now need at least 10 to 14 days to analyze samples they took from the attack site to verify if nerve gas was used. 'Redundant': The UN high representative for disarmament affairs negotiated with President Assad to let weapons inspectors into the country last week. They now need 10 to 14 days to analyze the samples they collected . The White House has called this investigation 'redundant' so President Obama has set up the military strike, pending approval from Congress. It's still uncertain whether or not Congress will support the strikes and there is a chance that they will vote against the strikes as the UK's Parliament did last week. Whether or not Congress approves the strikes, they will no longer come as a surprise to President Assad who has been given time to build up his defenses. 'This is one worry that we have. Sice the international community has begun talking about a response to the chemical massacre, what we have noticed is that the Assad regime has started moving different military units into different areas,' Khaled Saleh, media director of the Syrian National Coalition told Foreign Policy magazine. 'So they're using that time to hide their more well-armed units. And you know, when they move them to schools, the U.S. and the international community can't do a whole lot about that.' Pending approval: President Obama said he would wait to get authorization from Congress before carrying out any strike. He was pictured speaking on the phone to Speaker of the House John Boehner yesterday .","A U.S. intelligence report released Friday by the Obama Administration indicates that they knew about a chemical attack by the Syrian military three days before it happened .

"By . Bianca London . The brains behind the no-makeup selfie phenomenon which is sweeping social media and has raised £8 million - and counting - for a cancer charity has been revealed to be a teenage mother. Fiona Cunningham, 18, encouraged people to donate cash along with their selfies after actress Kim Novak kicked off the craze when she appeared bare-faced at the Oscars. The young mother-of-one set up a Facebook page from her bedroom in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, and encouraged people to post no-makeup selfies while donating cash to Cancer Research UK. Where it all began: Fiona Cunningham, 18, is the creator of the Facebook #nomakeupselfie page with nearly 250,000 followers . Incredibly, just days after creating the page on March 18 she received a staggering 260,000 'likes' from supporters across the globe. Fiona, who is studying for a degree in criminal psychology with the Open University, was flooded with selfies from around the world and she recruited 12 friends to sort through each picture and upload it to Facebook. Just four days after launching her Facebook group, Cancer Research UK proudly announced they had received £2million in donations as a direct result of the no-makeup selfie campaign. Fiona, who lives with her fiance Carl Cook, 26, and their one-year-old son Jenson, decided to raise awareness for the disease after losing close family members to cancer. #selfie: Fiona is the brainchild behind the no-makeup selfie phenomenon which has raised millions of pounds for a cancer charity and shows no sign of abating . Charitable: Fiona encouraged people to donate cash along with their selfies after actress Kim Novak kicked off the craze when she appeared bare-faced at the Oscars . She said: 'I read an article about Kim Novak’s decision not to wear makeup at the Oscars. 'The no-makeup selfie craze really captured my imagination and I was amazed at the response from people around the world and just thought how great it would be if it could be done for charity. 'After seeing nothing similar on Facebook or Twitter, I thought there was something in it that it could raise awareness of cancer. 'Initially I was just going to try and raise awareness for breast cancer, but it just became all cancer and that is even better. Starting a trend: Just days after creating the No Makeup Selfie for Cancer Awareness page on March 18, she received a staggering 260,000 likes from supporters across the globe . Overwhelming response: Fiona was flooded with selfies from around the world and she recruited 12 friends to sort through each picture . 'A few of my family members have had breast cancer and unfortunately one of them didn’t make it. 'Carl’s grandma also passed away from it so therefore it is quite close to home for us. I set up the Facebook group and encouraged to send in their selfies with a hasthtag linking it to Cancer Research UK. 'I thought a few people would join in and donate money, mainly my friends, but I was shocked when the page went global. 'I had to get some of my friends in to help me administrate the page straight away, it was just unbelievable. 'I was working around the clock just trying to keep up with the pictures coming in from everywhere. I’m overwhelmed and still think I must be dreaming. I’m just very proud and it’s thanks to everyone that it’s been so successful. Celebrity support: (L-R) Katherine Jenkins, Katy Perry, Jodie Marsh, Lady Gaga, Kate Lawler and Katie Piper have all jumped on board . 'So many women wear makeup and none of us really need it. The women who have done it are all so brave in a world that expects us all to wear makeup constantly.' Carl, a team manager at Vodafone, added: 'It’s absolutely crazy how it’s taken off. Fiona has put a lot of work to make it a success and I’m so proud of her. 'The money that has been raised is incredible and it’s had a fantastic response. We want to thank everyone who has got involved.' A spokesman for Cancer Research UK said: 'It’s brilliant it’s raising so much money. It’s totally unexpected because it wasn’t something we planned. 'The fact that people have chosen to donate to us has been quite overwhelming. Just putting out a Facebook post that says text us, the fact that people actually did take that action, has been so overwhelming. 'It’s great to see people getting involved.' And it's not just women getting involved - men are painting on the slap in support of Prostate Cancer UK. A spokesperson for the charity said: 'This is what our campaign Men United is all about - men using their camaraderie and creativity to do something individually and together about a killer disease. 'In this case, they’re using  humour to raise awareness and funds, but also to get the vital conversations going about prostate cancer. 'Phil Richman was inspired to start this slap-up idea because someone close to him put off going to the doctor until it was too late. It is fantastic that social networking is being used so positively and we are still seeing money roll in. 'Men United took its inspiration from the fantastic success of the breast cancer awareness campaign and it’s no surprise that women have inspired men again here. Making up is hard to do for a bloke - but it’s in a great cause.' Getting in on the action: Celebrities such as Coleen Rooney and Rylan Clark - who posted a photo of himself in support of Prostate Cancer UK - have joined in . Two sisters have become the oldest Brits to Tweet a no makeup selfie for charity - with a combined age of 174. Great-granmothers May Race, 93, and Brenda Page, 81, took a joint picture of their bare faces and each donated £5 to Cancer Research UK. Brenda, a retired receptionist, said they had done it because they had lost loved ones including their sister Ann to cancer. She said: 'We'd never heard of a selfie before but it was all a lot of fun. I have certainly never taken one before. We're not well up with those things, you see. 'I had to concentrate while I was pressing the button, so my sister has a bigger smile than me. It was a bit iffy but huge fun. 'I never wore makeup even when I was younger so that part didn't bother me. But May was always one for wearing it. 'It's a cause that's close to our hearts so we thought we'd have a laugh and go for it.' May and Brenda, from Heacham, Norfolk, are from a family of nine siblings and between them have 11 children, 23 grandchildren, 29 great-grandchildren, and four great-great-grandchildren. Jane Redman of Cancer Research UK said: 'We can't say for certain, but we're pretty sure May and Brenda are the oldest people to post a selfie as part of the #nomakeupselfie trend. 'Thanks to people choosing to donate to us we've been overwhelmed with donations and support in the past 48 hours. We've raised over £8m so far, and the £nomakeupselfie is still going strong. 'The trend isn't something Cancer Research UK started so it's been fantastic to see so many people getting involved and wanting to use their selfie to raise money for our life-saving research.'

"By . Amanda Williams . Belgian federal prosecutors are preparing to bring charges against the Church of Scientology as a 'criminal organisation',  it has today been reported. It is believed the charges of fraud, illegal medicine, . breaches of privacy and extortion have been drawn up against the Church . and two senior executives. De Tijd, Belgium's financial newspaper, has reported 'The subpoenas have only just been sent to the scientologists.' Belgian federal prosecutors are preparing to bring charges against the Church of Scientology as a 'criminal organisation' It is believed the charges relate to employment contracts issued to recruit volunteers and members in breach of Belgium's strict employment laws, the Telegraph reports. Prosecutors are investigating claims of extortion, illegal use of 'pseudo-medicine' and the keeping of records that go against privacy laws. According to De Standaard, raids on . Scientology offices in Belgium allegedly revealed evidence that the . group had spied on and extorted money from converts. A spokesman for the Church's Brussels headquarters said: 'Unfortunately we have not received anything from the prosecutor's office yet. The media have been informed, we have not.' It is not the first time the church has run into controversy for its techniques and beliefs, which include  the rejection of many medical practices and so called psychological 'auditing' of recruits. In February, an appeals court upheld fraud charges and a £490,000 fine against the Church of Scientology in France for convincing recruits to pay large sums for fake personality tests and cures. Scientology, which has many famous members including Hollywood actors John Travolta and Tom Cruise, is considered a 'cult' in many European countries . It is believed the church has been under investigation in Belgium for 15 years without any charges.

While it is regarded as a . religion in the United States, Italy and Spain, it is not recognised as a . church in other European countries such as France, Germany, Belgium and . Britain. It has also come under fire recently following the divorce of Mr Cruise and wife Katie Holmes, when it was reported the actress was concerned about their daughter Suri's future involvement with the religion.

"By . Gerri Peev . Voters could have to go back to the ballot box for a second general election next year if Scots choose independence. That’s because Scottish MPs could be removed from Westminster within months of a Yes vote in the referendum. This could potentially trigger another election as the abolition of the 59 Scottish seats could change the balance of power. Senior Tories warn David Cameron could go down in history as the Prime Minister who lost the union . If Labour wins a slim majority, . experts have said it would leave Westminster with a ‘zombie government’, . forced to limp on as a minority administration. This . is because Ed Miliband’s party is particularly reliant on Scottish . seats to bolster its power. It won 41 seats north of the border in 2010, . whereas the Conservatives have just one Scottish seat. While . elections are meant to be held only once every five years, a snap . election can still be triggered if there is a vote of no confidence in a . government. There are even calls from Tories to oust Scottish MPs before the 2015 election. This would deprive Scots of a vote in the general election, as well as removing all  Scottish seats. However, David Cameron knows this would project a negative message ahead of the September 18 referendum. Some Tories even say Mr Cameron will have to resign if Scotland votes for independence. One . senior Conservative said Mr Cameron would ‘go down in history as the . Prime Minister who lost the union’ and would have no choice but to quit . Downing Street. Protest: A pro-independence rally in Edinburgh. The no to independence campaign's lead is thinning . Other Tory . MPs called for a law change to block Scottish voters from taking part in . the 2015 general election if they back independence later this year. Votes in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on September 18. Recent polls have suggested that support for going it alone is rising, with the no campaign’s lead narrowing. In a major political headache, if Scotland votes for independence it will not break away officially until 2016. It . means that in theory voters north of the border will still be able to . take part in the 2015 general election to choose MPs for Westminster. Senior Tories now want to ban all 59 constituencies north of the border from taking part in the general election. The . move would make a dramatic difference to the outcome of the election . next year, wiping out a significant section of Labour's powerbase and a . sizeable number of Liberal Democrats. In May 2010 Labour won 41 seats, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP six while the Conservatives secured just one MP. First Minister Alex Salmond has been buoyed by polls showing a narrowing between the Yes and No campaigns . So far, there has been no decision on what would happen to Scotland's Westminster seats between parliamentary elections and March 2016, when it would become an independent nation, in the event of a yes vote this autumn. It is widely assumed that elections would continue as usual but Scottish MPs would then vacate their seats when links are severed. Tories believe it would unacceptable, however, for them to hold their seats while London and Edinburgh were negotiating the break-up of the UK . Scottish-born John Stevenson, who represents Carlisle, told The Times: ‘Why should the peoples of Northern Ireland, Wales and England have laws passed in this House by MPs who for all intents and purposes are about to be part of a foreign country?’ Downing Street insists Mr Cameron is focussed on winning the referendum to keep Scotland in the UK, so the issue will not arise. But privately many Tories believe his position will be untenable if voters back independence. A No 10 source said: ‘The Prime Minister is focused on making the case for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.’ A record 4.1million Scots are now registered to vote as more people sign up to take part in the independence referendum. The . figure is almost 60,000 more than in December 2012 and has been fuelled . by 16 and 17-yearolds who are not eligible to take part in General or . Scottish elections but can do so in the referendum. Around 92,000 out of a possible 120,000 young Scots have signed up. The . figures have been compiled by the Electoral Commission's 15 Scottish . electoral registration officers (EROs), following an annual canvas of . voters between October 2013 and March 2014. The . deadline to register to vote in the independence referendum is . September 2, 2014. Andy O'Neill, head of the Scotland office at the . Electoral Commission, said: 'The snapshot provided by the publication of . the electoral registers gives an indication of the hard work already . put in by electoral registration officers, but that hard work doesn't . stop now. 'The EROs will . continue to encourage as many people who are eligible to register to . take action and get themselves registered before the September 2 . deadline, in order to take part in the referendum. 'The . commission will support EROs activities by launching a public awareness . campaign in the summer, reminding people that the only way to vote at . the referendum is to be on the register.'","Narrowing of opinion polls heaps pressure on David Cameron .

"By . Gerri Peev . Maria Miller faces being censured for over-claiming for her mortgage expenses on a house she sold for £1 million profit. The Conservative culture secretary is understood to have failed to reduce her claims when mortgage interest rates fell on the loan on her home. It was sold on Valentine's Day this year for £1.47 million - a profit of £1,236,000 on its original price of £234,000. She bought her house in Wimbledon, south-west London, in 1995 with her husband, but the mortgage was for more than twice the house purchase price and was increased in 2007 - when she was an MP -  to £575,000. Over-claiming: Culture secretary Maria Miller bought her house in Wimbledon, London, for £234,000 in 1995, but the mortgage was more than twice the house purchase price and was increased in 2007 to £575,000 . Taxpayers were billed for the interest on the mortgage between 2005 - when she became MP - and 2009, because Mrs Miller had designated it as her second home. She lived there with her husband and parents but designated a rented property in Basingstoke, her constituency, as her main home. At the time MPs were able to claim mortgage interest on their official second home, before the rules were changed in the wake of the expenses scandal. In all she claimed £90,000 over four years for the property. But – as interest rates fell in the wake of the 2008/2009 financial meltdown – she should have reduced her claims for reimbursement and failed to do. Mrs Miller faces repaying up to £5,000 and being made to apologise after delaying providing financial information to a Parliamentary inquiry into her expenses, which concludes this week, the Daily Telegraph reports. More... Blow for Tories as only one in 10 Ukip voters would switch to stop Ed Miliband . Prices soar 20% in property hotspots prompting fears of bubble as average home in London sells for more than £400,000 . The issue may lead to calls for Mrs Miller to quit the cabinet. But an aide for Mrs Miller insisted last night: ‘This is absolutely not a resignation issue.’ Censure: Taxpayers were billed for the interest on the mortgage. In all she claimed £90,000 over four years for the property which was near her parents' home . She and her husband are understood to have made a healthy profit on the Wimbledon house, which sold for £1.47million on Valentine’s Day of this year – an increase of £1,236,000. The inquiry into Mrs Miller’s expenses started around 18 months ago. Questions were first raised over whether the Wimbledon property was genuinely a second home as her parents, children and husband lived there, not at the Basingstoke property. It was against rules for an MP's parents or other members of their extended family to benefit from expenses payments. However the investigation has centred on the amounts she claimed and what her mortgage payments actually were. The Parliamentary Commissioner is understood to have concluded that the arrangement did not lead to Mrs Miller benefiting financially. Mrs Miller could also be asked by MPs on the standards committee to apologise to Parliament for not co-operating in a ‘timely manner’ with the commissioner. A final report is expected before the Easter recess. A source close to Mrs Miller said: ‘Maria has co-operated fully with the inquiry, asked for by the Labour Party, which has now been going on for a year and a half amidst constant unfounded speculation. We hope it will conclude soon. ‘It is not surprising that London houses go up in value well over a decade after they are first bought . It is also not unusual for people to move house.’ There was no prohibition on MPs making capital gains from second homes, but some promised to hand any profits to the taxpayer when they sold their houses. Among those who have done so are Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, when he sold his constituency home in Sheffield.","Maria Miller bought a house in Wimbledon, London, for £234,000 in 1995 .

The Catalans struggled under Gerardo Martino in failing to progress beyond the Champions League quarter-finals and surrendering the La Liga title to Atletico Madrid. The central defender has penned a new five-year deal, which could see him finish his career at the Nou Camp, on the back of Luis Enrique succeeding Martino last week. All smiles: Gerard Pique has signed a new contract at Barcelona until the end of the 2018/19 season . Here for the long-term: The central defender could end his career at the Nou Camp . And - even after a tricky 12 months - Pique is left in no doubt that the new boss can yield success. 'FC Barcelona have to be at the top, winning titles and feeling important among the elite of European and world football,' the 27-year-old said. 'We have a team, and a coach. We have all the ingredients to get back where we belong.' Barcelona are clearly pleased to tie Pique down to his best years - president Josep Maria Bartomeu claimed he is 'the best centre-back in the world' - while the player himself sees no problem in retiring at the club. Pique will be 32 if he sees out his contract - something the former Manchester United man is relishing. 'Knowing that I could live out my career here is a big boost for me,' he added. 'I hope we can enjoy as many successes as we have had already.' The Barca squad never took to Martino's ideas and there appears to be renewed vigour around the place after Enrique was installed. 'I am very excited. In his press conference he showed that he’s very clear about his ideas. He knows this place well and I think he’ll do a lot of good for us.

"By . Gerri Peev, Political Correspondent . and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . For a man who ‘loves a game of bingo’, George Osborne appeared to need help yesterday in telling his two little ducks from his two fat ladies. ‘How do you know the numbers?’ he asked Shirley Nixon during a visit to Cardiff to publicise the cut in bingo tax unveiled in the Budget. Having been shown how to mark his card, Mr Osborne, who had been among politicians rushing to profess their love of the game after the Government was accused of patronising the working classes, nearly scooped the £300 prize pool. Chancellor George Osborne shared a laugh with fellow bingo player Shirley Nixon . The Chancellor visited Castle Bingo in Cardiff to promote his halving of bingo tax to 10 per cent in last week's Budget . After having fun playing one game, Mr Osborne stayed for a second and came withing three numbers of winning the £300 jackpot . ‘I never expected to give the Chancellor a lesson in bingo,’ said Mrs . Nixon. ‘He asked what to do and I told him – and he was brilliant at it. But then you would expect him to be good with figures, wouldn’t you?’ Her . husband, Colin, said: ‘He didn’t ask us many questions because he was . concentrating. On the last game, he was only three numbers off from . winning.’ Despite his apparent ignorance of the game, the Chancellor came close to bagging £300 for . himself  when he went eyes . down at a bingo hall in Cardiff. The Chancellor has spent the week meeting . and greeting across the country, tying his hand at driving a train, . pulling a pint, tightening bolts in a factory and eyeing up the new £1 . coin. But it was his attempt to play bingo which was the most striking. Last week Mr Osborne boasted: ‘I drink beer and I love a game of bingo.’ In last week’s Budget Mr Osborne sought to woo blue collar voters by halving duty on bingo to 10 per cent and taking a penny off a pint of beer. He then signed off a Conservative party advert to promote the policy which stated: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy.’ But the use of the word ‘they’ was widely criticised, with the Lib Dems call it ‘silly’ and Labour saying it was ‘condescending’. Mr Osborne was mocked online yesterday after being pictured supping a pint of Sunbeam ale Wolverhampton before it had settled . The visit of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was not going to distract people from checking their numbers . Players were apparently delighted to have the Chancellor join them for a game of bingo on a Tuesday afternoon . George Osborne has been accused before of changing his speech to sound less posh. But today there was a debate about whether he was talking mockney or Westcountry. The Chancellor paid a visit to the Royal Mint in Llantrisant after he announced last week that the £1 coin is to be replaced. The new 12-sided coin modelled on the old thrupenny bit is to be put into circulation by 2017. While watching coins coming off the production line, Mr Osborne was seen telling workers: ‘It’s gonna be great, innit?’ It was suggested he was trying to sound like a London teenager by using 'innit' but others insisted it was more Westcountry. Yesterday Mr Osborne was pictured . awkwardly supping a pint of beer and today’s photo opportunity involved a . game or two of bingo. The . millionaire Chancellor took part in a £1 main game session alongside . bingo regulars, who helped the multi-millionaire keep tabs on his . numbers. Having planned to stay for one game he was having so much fun he ended up staying for a second, when he came within three numbers of winning the £300 jackpot. Bingo regular Margaret Evans, 73, of Cardiff, who was in the bingo hall with Mr Osborne, said: ‘He looked like he enjoyed himself. ‘I was quite surprised when I came down here today and heard that the Chancellor of the Exchequer - who's mega rich - would be coming to play a game of bingo. She joked: ‘I just hope the economy isn't that bad that George Osborne needs to find a few quid from playing bingo!’ Yesterday Mr Osborne was pictured sipping . the top out of a pint of Sunbeam ale during a visit to Marston's . Brewery in Wolverhampton. Sunbeam . is described as a ‘gloriously zesty blonde beer with a 4.2% ABV brewed . to be easy drinking and refreshing with a clean long finish’. Writing . on Twitter, Mr Osborne said: ‘Great to visit Marston's brewery in . Wolverhampton with @pauluppalmp. They're creating 3,000 new jobs. From . today - another penny off a pint.’ Today his tour took in the Royal Mint and Tata Steel's Port Talbot works. Mr Osborne said the Government's annual spending plan would boost big industry via a £7 billion promise to reduce energy costs. ‘Welsh manufacturing is some of the best in the world,’ the Chancellor said.‘There is no reason why Wales and Britain cannot lead the world in advanced manufacturing.’Karl Kohler, the boss of Tata Steel's European operations, welcomed the Government's plans. ‘The measures announced in the Budget to introduce relief against the rapidly rising costs of energy taxes, which pose a very real risk to Britain's foundation industries, are extremely welcome.’ Money, money, money: The Chancellor toured the Royal Mint after announcing the £1 coin is to be replaced . He discussed how the new 12-sided coin will be struck with staff at the site in Llantrisant, Wales . Hands on: Later Mr Osborne was shown how to drive a train during a visit to Tata Steel . Mr Osborne shakes the hand of train driver Nigel Hunt during his visit in Port Talbot, Wales . The Budget announced support for energy intensive manufacturing, including plants like Tata's Port Talbot factory which is the largest steel plant in the UK, producing five million tonnes of steel annually and employing over 4,000 people . The Port Talbot steelworks employs more than 3,000 staff, with a 1,000-strong contractor workforce.Its fortunes dipped during the recession, but bosses are targeting the production of 4.3 million tonnes of steel by the end of the year. In a bid to shake-off the Tory reputation for being out-of-touch, Mr Osborne has made a concerted effort to tour the country - often donning hi-vis to prove he is getting on with a tough job. Yesterday Mr Osborne tried his hand at some engineering work during a visit to Cube Precision Engineering in Rowley Regis, West Midlands. He also took tea with the Very Rev'd Dr John Davies, Dean of Derby, after a visit to Derby Cathedral. Today he was shown how to drive a train during a visit to Tata Steel to see how it has been affected by the budget.","George Osborne given a bingo lesson from Shirley Nixon, 81 .

"By . Gerri Peev . Damage to the British economy from trade sanctions against Russia would be a 'price worth paying', William Hague said yesterday. Travel bans and asset freezes against Moscow's 'bullying' behaviour towards Ukraine were planned, the Foreign Secretary said. America has admitted that the sanctions will have more impact on the EU than on the US – Europe buys much of its gas from Russia – and many fear London, where Russian oligarchs have invested billions, will suffer. Foreign Secretary William Hague has said travel bans and asset freezes against Moscow's 'bullying' behaviour towards Ukraine were planned . Mr Hague said that despite this 'more far-reaching measures' were being prepared that would have a fundamental impact. He told Sky's Murnaghan programme: 'It would be a price worth paying if this situation continues to deteriorate... history teaches us that we have to stand up to such bullying behaviour from one state on to another.' Any fresh sanctions made against Russia will be targeted to hurt those closest to Vladimir Putin and to have a significant impact on the Russian economy. Those expected to be penalised include the companies controlled by the Russian President's inner circle and the Russian defence industry. David Cameron has suggested that Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich could be hit by sanctions because of his association with Mr Putin. President Barack Obama said that Mr Putin (pictured) would be deterred from further aggressive acts in Ukraine if he saw the world was unified in punishing Moscow . Alex Salmond says he admires Vladimir Putin – despite the Russian President’s crackdown on Ukrainian sovereignty. Scotland’s First Minister said Mr Putin had restored a ‘substantial part of Russian pride’. His remarks to a magazine were made on March 14, just two weeks before Russian soldiers annexed Crimea. Praising ‘certain aspects’ of Mr Putin, Mr Salmond added: ‘You can see why he carries support in Russia.’ Patricia Ferguson, Scottish Labour’s external affairs spokesman, said the comments were ‘insensitive and ill-judged’. Last night neither Downing Street nor the Foreign Office would be drawn on who could be on the latest sanctions list, ahead of talks today. In Washington, Republicans have called for the West to send 'shockwaves' by hitting Gazprom and Russian banks with sanctions. Financial markets have plummeted by more than a fifth in Russia since the start of the year, with the value of the rouble at an all-time low. President Barack Obama said that Mr Putin would be deterred from further aggressive acts in Ukraine if he saw the world was unified in punishing Moscow. He accused Mr Putin of failing to lift a finger to persuade pro-Russian militants to comply with the  Geneva deal intended to defuse  the situation. One of a team of European monitors seized by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine was freed last night. The man – believed to be Swedish – was released on medical grounds. He was one of eight monitors detained in Sloviansk on Friday accused of being Nato spies. Three bloodied and blindfolded Ukrainian men accused by separatists of being spies were allowed to be filmed. They were caught while on a mission to detain a Russian suspected of killing a Ukrainian MP. Pro-Russian armed groups seized the main TV and radio station in Donetsk yesterday.","Foreign Secretary says damage to UK economy is worth it .

"By . Gerri Peev . and Harriet Arkell . Scots should raise their own taxes to pay for 40 per cent of all their spending, Gordon Brown said yesterday. As he made a personal plea for the Union between Scotland and the rest of the UK to remain, the former Prime Minister backed calls for more powers to be devolved north of the border. Mr Brown, who has maintained a low profile since the 2010 election, said that Westminster should arrange a power-sharing arrangement with Edinburgh. 'We must work together': Former prime minister Gordon Brown today set out his view of a more devolved Scotland in the case of a No vote in September's referendum . More tax control: Mr Brown said more powers should be devolved to the Scottish parliament, pictured . The Scottish Parliament should get new . tax-raising powers to create a ‘partnership of equals’ between Scotland . and the United Kingdom, and Holyrood should raise 40 per cent of the . cash it spends on devolved policies, Mr Brown said. He . also set out a six-point plan to devolve more powers to Edinburgh, . including a guarantee that the Scottish Parliament was here to stay and . did not exist at the ‘whim’ of Westminster. Other . proposals include giving Holyrood more powers over employment, health, . transport and economic regeneration; new power-sharing partnerships to . tackle poverty, unemployment, housing need and the environment and a . ‘radical’ transfer of powers from Westminster and Edinburgh to local . communities. The Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath MP said Scots had to work with the rest of the UK for the common good .

Scotland is due . to get new powers over income tax from April 2016, when the UK Treasury . will deduct 10p from standard and upper rates of income tax in Scotland . and give MSPs the power to decide how to raise cash. Mr . Brown went further than this, though, saying: ‘The first 5p of income . tax should be decided by the UK government, the next 15p by the Scottish . government. ‘I believe that . is a fair way of raising 40 per cent of the revenue of the Scottish . Parliament in Scotland.’ Mr Brown was outlining his vision for life in Scotland in the case of people voting against independence . This would make Scottish politicians . ‘accountable to the people of Scotland for the way that money is spent’. Mr . Brown also suggested the Scottish Parliament should have powers to . change the top rate of income tax, saying: ‘If the fairness of the . Scottish Parliament was being undermined by unfairness elsewhere then . there should be power to do something about it.’ But . Blair Jenkins, from the pro-separation group Yes Scotland, said: ‘A Yes . vote is the only way to ensure Scotland is in charge of its own broad . tax base, and that decisions on welfare and pensions reflect Scotland’s . wishes.’ Mr Brown has submitted his proposals to .

"By . Associated Press . Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison for bribery, money laundering and other corruption that spanned his two terms as mayor — including the chaotic years after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. U.S. District Judge Helen Berrigan handed down the sentence Wednesday morning. Nagin was convicted February 12 of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars from businessmen who wanted work from the city or Nagin's support for various projects. Scroll down for video . Corrupt: Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin is surrounded by the the media as he arrives for his sentencing hearing Wednesday, where he was later handed a 10 year prison term for money laundering, accepting bribes, and other corrupt misdeeds . The bribes came in the form of money, free vacations and truckloads of free granite for his family business. The 58-year-old Democrat had defiantly denied any wrongdoing after his 2013 indictment and during his February trial. Nagin was a political newcomer when he won election as New Orleans' mayor, succeeding Marc Morial in 2002. He cast himself as a reformer and announced crackdowns on corruption in the city's automobile-inspection and taxi-permit programs. But federal prosecutors say his own corrupt acts began during his first term, continued through the Katrina catastrophe and flourished in his second term. Until his indictment in 2013, he was perhaps best known for a widely heard radio interview in which he angrily, and sometimes profanely, asked for stepped-up federal response in the days after levee breaches flooded most of the city during Katrina. He also drew notoriety for impolitic remarks, such as the racially charged ‘New Orleans will be chocolate again’ and his comment that a growing violent crime problem ‘keeps the New Orleans brand out there.’ Then: Elected in 2002 with strong support from the business community and white voters, Nagin won re-election in 2006 with a campaign that sometimes played on fears among black voters that they were being left out of the city's spotty recovery . A New Orleans neighborhood destroyed by hurricane Katrina is shown in this 11 September 2005 photo. Many of Nagin's misdeeds occurred as the stricken city struggled to re-emerge from the rubble of Katrina . Elected in 2002 with strong support from the business community and white voters, Nagin won re-election in 2006 with a campaign that sometimes played on fears among black voters that they were being left out of the city's spotty recovery. He was limited by law to two consecutive terms but a third term would have been unlikely, giving plunging approval ratings and the stricken city's continued recovery struggles. He was succeeded in 2010 by Mitch Landrieu. Most government pre-sentence reports and recommendations were not made public but a filing by Jenkins ahead of the sentencing hearing indicated prosecutors were pushing for a sentence of 20 years or more under federal sentencing guidelines. Defense attorney Robert Jenkins said that would amount to a virtual life sentence for the former mayor. Jenkins said Nagin's family needs him, there is no danger of Nagin committing more crimes and that the crimes for which Nagin was convicted constituted an aberration from an otherwise model life. Prosecutors said the schemes that led to Nagin's conviction included two family members: His two grown sons were never charged with a crime but they were part of the family business that received free granite from a contractor. They also said that what Jenkins calls an ‘aberration’ was behavior that spanned six years and involved multiple contractors.","Ray Nagin, 58, received the sentence for bribery, money laundering and other corruption on Wednesday .

"A government agency in Chile has published a report on two photographs showing an object which it claims 'can be qualified as a UFO.' The Committee for the Studies of Anomalous Aerial Phenomena (CEFAA), part of Chile's Ministerial Department of Civil Aeronautics, studied photographs of the object after it was spotted by four engineers above a remote copper mine. According to the report, the engineers described the object as 'a flattened disc of brilliant colour with a diameter of 5 to 10 metres [16 to 32 feet]. It performed ascending, descending and horizontal movements in short lengths, about 600 meters above the ground.' Scroll down for video . The Commitee for the Studies of Anomalous Aerial Phenomena (CEFAA) studied the photographs of an object spotted by four engineers above a remote copper mine . Following investigations, the CEFAA ruled out the possibility of any meteorological phenomena, including lenticular clouds, along with experimental aircraft, planes, and weather balloons . One of the workers reportedly took the pictures on a Kenox Samsung S860 camera after they spotted the object at the Collahuasi copper mine while they were working there in April 2013. While the engineers did not want to talk about the sighting, the photographer did tell a colleague at the mine, who sent copies of the images to the CEFAA earlier this year. The engineer who sent the pictures on to the government agency also passed on information provided to him by the witnesses, the Huffington Post has reported. Following investigations, the CEFAA ruled out the possibility of any meteorological phenomena, including lenticular clouds, along with experimental aircraft, planes, and weather balloons, according to the Inquisitr. The agency also ruled out the possibility of drones in the area. CEFAA international affairs director Jose Lay told Leslie Kean, for the Huffington Post: 'Fishing companies use drones and they make a lot of noise. This was definitely not a drone.' According to the report, the engineers described the object as 'a flattened disc of brilliant colour with a diameter of 5 to 10 metres [16 to 32 feet]' The study concludes: 'It is an object or phenomenon of great interest, and it can be qualified as a UFO.' Caution has been urged however . regarding the conclusions, primarily as the four engineers who witnessed . the incident refused to co-operate with the agency conducting the . investigation. The report . was released in the same week as the CIA revealed they were responsible . for a number of 'UFO' sightings in Norway in the 1950s. Throughout . the decade, numerous lights in the sky were reported by members of the . public and pilots alike, with some suggesting they were of . extraterrestrial origin. The study concludes: 'It is an object or phenomenon of great interest, and it can be qualified as a UFO' But the CIA last week revealed it was the agency flying their secretive U-2 aircraft high in the atmosphere. In a tweet the CIA said: ‘Remember reports of unusual activity in the skies in the ‘50s? That was us.’ Meanwhile, a series of images from Nasa's Curiosity rover, which shows a white dot appearing to descend to the surface of Mars, was also explained this week. While one Youtuber claimed the images was evidence of a UFO landing on the red planet, Nasa said the anomaly can be easily explained as a so-called 'hot pixel' in one of the cameras.","Government agency in Chile says object is 'of great interest, and it can be qualified as a UFO'

"By . James Chapman . and Gerri Peev . Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, said voters were increasingly uneasy about the number of extremists in Ukip . Iain Duncan Smith has claimed voters are increasingly ‘uneasy’ at ‘extreme elements’ of Ukip as a row raged about the wisdom of a new campaign attacking the upstart party as racist. The Work and Pensions Secretary, the standard bearer of the Tory Right in the Cabinet, suggested a slew of stories about extreme views of Ukip members and candidates would undermine the party’s credibility. Mr Duncan Smith’s intervention came days after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also suggested Ukip has extremist elements. A cross-party campaign branding the party racist will launch later this week - despite warnings from some senior Labour MPs that it could prove counterproductive. Barbara Roche, Labour’s former immigration minister, who is behind the campaign, said: ‘Ukip’s campaign needs to be exposed for what it is, a racist campaign. The party is practising what is in effect a form of ‘Euracism’. 'They are deploying the same language and tactics used by openly racist parties like the BNP, but instead of targeting migrants from Africa and Asia they are targeting migrants from within the EU.’ Nadhim Zahawi, a Number 10 policy adviser, co-sponsors the Migration Matters Trust, chaired by Miss Roche, which is to coordinate the poster and social media campaign. But Jacqui Smith, the former Labour Home Secretary, who warned there were no votes to be won by suggesting Ukip voters are ‘closet racists’. Pointing to Gordon Brown’s attack on the Rochdale pensioner Gillian Duffy as ‘bigoted’ during the 2010 election campaign, she said: ‘Did we not learn from ‘bigotgate’ in 2010 that there are many potential and actual Labour voters who feel all the frustrations and insecurities expressed by the Ukip poster campaign? Telling them they are wrong - and worse, closet racists - is unlikely to win their support.’ Margaret Hodge, the senior Labour MP credited with killing off the BNP in her east London constituency, said she agreed with Miss Smith. ‘If you are going to rebuild trust in the traditional political parties, you have to really listen and understand the concerns of the public. If people feel they can’t get a house or can’t get their kid into a school, you have to understand that. ‘Scapegoating immigrants is not the answer but you have got to listen to people’s frustrations to be able to engage with them. Labelling them as racists is wrong and counterproductive,’ she said. William Henwood, pictured, who was standing for Ukip in Enfield, London, quit his party membership after he called on comedian Lenny Henry to emigrate to 'a black country' Mr Farage claimed there was an establishment plot by the main parties against Ukip, urging voters to ‘give the creeps a lesson’ at the ballot box. His claims that the three main parties were ‘ganging up’ on Ukip, saying: ‘I think the British public will take this extremely badly. I believe they want and appreciate the new choices being offered to them by Ukip on issues like immigration control, and will certainly not appreciate being branded racist for doing so . ‘I am really sorry that millions of people who have decided to vote Ukip next month now find themselves accused by the political establishment of supporting racism.’ ‘The electorate is not in the mood to be intimidated by the political establishment and Messrs Cameron, Miliband and Clegg have just made another disastrous mistake. I call on all fair-minded British people to swing behind Ukip and teach these creeps a lesson they won’t forget in a hurry.’ The major parties are rattled by Ukip's strong performance in opinion polls . Mr Duncan Smith said the revelations about Ukip and its members ‘would take some time to seep through’ but said polling showed voters - particularly those who have previously voted Conservative - were alarmed by Ukip’s association with the views of the far-Right BNP. Addressing young Conservative activists in remarks leaked to the website breitbart.com, Mr Duncan Smith said there was a ‘whiff of extremism coming through’, adding: ‘I know from polling that voters who have voted Conservative feel very uneasy with the association of UKIP close to what I call some quite extreme elements. ‘This kind of stuff worries them but it takes some time to seep through. We know genuinely the last thing conservatives want to be associated with is anything that touches on the BNP. ‘They genuinely don’t like the BNP and the suggestions that UKIP may be in any way close to that is a problem, so just telling them about the Government that is rational, reasonable and getting the job done is quite important.’ But Mr Duncan Smith warned that in terms of the European Parliament elections next month, which people would use as a ‘protest vote’, Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage could only profit from controversy. ‘No matter what publicity he gets, the better it is for him. The more he’s in the public eye the more he gains because he’s not us. He’s not Conservative, he’s not Labour, he’s not Lib Dem,’ he said.","IDS claims conservative voters 'uncomfortable' with extreme Ukip views .

"By . Gerri Peev . and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Day after day this week Nigel Farage’s Ukip has endured accusations of fakery and racism... and yesterday even more gaffes continued to surface. It emerged that a ‘British builder’ featuring in a poster complaining about cheap foreign labour was in fact an Irish actor. And there was further embarrassment after a senior Ukip party manager posted an advertisement in his local newspaper suggesting Muslims take multiple wives so they could get extra benefits. Scroll down for video . Ukip faced embarrassment after it emerged the builder in its latest anti-immigration advert was an actor, Dave O'Rourke, who is from Ireland . Never rains then it pours: Ukip leader Nigel Farage admitted something had gone wrong with the party's vetting system . Still smiling: Nigel Farage is faring well in the polls ahead of the European elections next month . A week that started with Ukip looking . forward to unveiling its £1.5million European election poster campaign . was ending last night with the party firmly on the back foot. It . has spent days defending itself against a barrage of complaints that . its posters were ‘racist’ and that a ‘voter’ featured in the ads was in . fact a Farage aide, Lizzy Vaid. Then . yesterday it emerged that one of the poster stars, who appeared to be a . British builder ‘hit hard by unlimited cheap labour’, was actually an . Irish actor, Dave O’Rourke. In . his profile on the acting website StarNow, Mr O’Rourke said he could . speak in several accents including Irish, South African, English, . Scottish and German. The launch of the anti-immigration poster campaign on Tuesday was supposed to mark the start of a new, more professional era for Ukip. The award-winning Edinburgh-based advertising agency Family - which has worked for the BBC, Debenhams and the Conservatives - helped produce the campaign funded by ex-Tory donor Paul Sykes. But critics branded the slogans 'racist', even before revelations about the people in the poster and TV adverts plunged the party into turmoil. Builder in TV advert posts racist tweetsZimbabwean . decorator Andre Lampitt posed in a builder's hard hat to complain that . ‘lads from Eastern Europe’ were undercutting him. But on Twitter he . posted a series of offensive comments,  claiming Ed Miliband is ‘not . British’, condemned Islam as ‘evil’, branding the Prophet Mohammed a . paedophile and saying he wanted Africans to ‘kill themselves off’. UKIP RESPONSE: Nigel Farage: 'Repellent was the word we used, and I will . stick with that. We have put in place a vetting procedure and something . has gone wrong.' Lizzy Vaid appears in a full-page . photograph as a voter from Devon, but is actually Ukip’s events manager . and an assistant to the party leader. UKIP RESPONSE: Nigel .

Eye-catching poster shows a builder . begging on the street with the message: 'EU policy at work. British . workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour.' But he is Dave O'Rourke, an actor from Ireland who moved to Britain 10 years ago. UKIP RESPONSE: Director of communications Patrick O'Flynn: 'The vast . majority of people used in political poster campaigns are actors. It is . totally standard practice.' He . said: ‘I’m originally from Dublin, Living in the UK 10 years. I’m . currently acting full time and looking to build my portfolio.’ His CV includes a part as 'a troubled . youth with psychotic tendencies' in Saltwater, a 2001 Irish drama with . In Bruges and Harry Potter star Brendan Gleeson. He has since taken part in two drama courses in Edinburgh and played an HMRC officer in the 2008 drama Adulthood. People from Ireland are able to move freely to the UK under the immigration rules which Mr Farage is campaigning against. To add to the embarrassment, only this week Mr Farage boasted: 'Most parties use actors. We use Ukippers.' It followed the revelation that 'Lizzy . Vaid from Devon' who featured in the party's manifesto is actually . Ukip's events manager based in London. Another . row blew up yesterday after David Challice, a leading party activist in . the South West, placed an advert in his local newspaper for his . discount store business which offered a ‘money spinner’ ‘for ‘any . cash-strapped Moslem [sic] reading this’. It . went on to suggest that men could take a ‘harem’ of wives to get an . extra £33.65 a week in  benefits from the Department for Work and . Pensions for each of them. He also made sexist comments suggesting women should not go out to work, that they were  natural home makers. Mr . Challice said he had discussed this issue with his wife Hilary and that . ‘since the snow came back all she’s done is look through the window. If . it gets any worse I’ll have to let her back in again’. Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday admitted 'something went wrong' with the party's vetting system. As . Ukip struggled to get its election campaign back on track, Conservative . MP Bob Neill said of the poster using an Irish actor to depict a . British builder: ‘Here is another example of Ukip being cynical and not . being straight with the British voters.’ Ukip . director of communications Patrick O’Flynn said: ‘The vast majority of . people used in political poster campaigns are actors. It is nonsense for . the Conservative Party to try and depict this as anything out of the . ordinary.’ The party . defended Mr Challice’s comments in his advert, saying there were ‘quite . legitimate concerns about the interaction of the benefits system with . men who have multiple wives’. A . spokesman added: ‘Mr Challice’s remarks about women in the workplace . and his wife were intended as a joke and indeed were understood as such. He does not seriously believe women should not work. Given that his . wife works in the same office as he does, it would be curious if he . did.’ Mr Challice also made derogatory remarks about Greeks and Turks in a book he published. On another front, Mr Farage last night faced accusations that he was changing his tune on having his expenses audited. The Ukip leader had earlier suggested that he would be happy to have a probe into his allowances as an MEP. But . in an interview with the Guardian last night, he denied he had ever . suggested it. ‘I said if every other British MEP wants to, then I would. I am not going to be one out of 73 that is held up as an example of all . that is wrong with the European Union.’ Zimbabwean decorator Andre Lampitt appeared in the Ukip party political broadcast to complain about the impact of immigration in Britain .

"By . Gerri Peev, Political Correspondent . Action: Former Chancellor Alistair Darling claims the English should have a vote on whether a separate Scotland could keep the pound . The English should have a vote on whether a separate Scotland could keep the pound, former Chancellor Alistair Darling has said. Mr Darling - who leads the pro-union Better Together campaign - suggested that residents in the rest of the United Kingdom could seal the fate of whether an independent Scotland is part of a currency union. Scottish separatists were given a boost last weekend when an unnamed minister said that ‘of course’ Scotland could keep sterling as part of negotiations. But that claim - made by an anonymous minister to the Guardian - was slapped down by George Osborne, the Chancellor, and his Treasury deputy Danny Alexander. Until then, the threat of an independent Scotland losing the pound had been a key argument for the Better Together campaign, which has warned Scots of the economic consequences of quitting the UK. Only Scots will have a say on whether they get to stay as part of the UK in the September 18 referendum. But Mr Darling added to the confusion by holding out the possibility of a UK-wide referendum, likening Scots keeping the pound to the controversy about Britain entering the euro. ‘I think people in the rest of the UK do need to have a say as to whether or not they go into a single currency. This is important,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He added that the major political parties would almost certainly oppose a currency union ‘because it would mean pooled, shared sovereignty in the same ways it would do if you joined the euro’. Mr Darling leads the Better Together campaign, which has faced criticism for failing to show the same 'hunger' as the separatists' Yes campaign. Above, Mary Macleod, Mr Darling, Danny Alexander and Lord Strathclyde . The Better Together campaign - and Mr Darling himself - have faced criticism for failing to show the same ‘hunger’ as the separatists’ Yes campaign. But despite being the man in charge of rescuing the banks during the financial crisis in 2008, Mr Darling insisted that the campaign to save the UK was ‘the most important thing I’ve ever done in my political life’. But Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy First Minister of Scotland, accused the Better Together campaign of ‘bluffing’ over Scotland being denied the pound. Last weekend, an unnamed minister claimed ‘of course’ Scotland could keep sterling as part of negotiations. But the claim was slapped down by Chancellor George Osborne (left) and his deputy Danny Alexander (right) She said there was no need for a referendum in the UK ‘for the simple reason that the currency arrangements of the rest of the UK wouldn’t be changing’. ‘They use sterling right now and would continue to use sterling in partnership with Scotland,’ she said. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister however insisted that it was ‘flatly wrong’ to claim that Scotland could keep the sterling. Standing firm: Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said Scotland could not 'have their cake and eat it' if voters decided to opt out of the UK in the referendum . The Deputy Prime Minister said Scotland could not ‘have their cake and eat it’ if voters decided to opt out of the UK in the September referendum. A Downing Street spokesman sought to limit the impact of the remarks at the weekend, stating: ‘There will not be a currency union in the event of independence.’ The Yes campaign suffered a setback yesterday however when an influential think tank warned that a separate Scotland would not have access to major spy agencies and intelligence. The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said an independent Scotland would face huge hurdles in establishing its own spy agency. It would not have the automatic access to the ‘five eyes’ currently enjoyed as part of the UK which links intelligence agencies in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Scotland could become vulnerable during the time it would take up to set up a separate a spy agency. But it could also leave the UK more exposed if terrorists targeted a ‘weaker’ Scotland to inflict atrocities from a more relaxed environment. ‘A weak Scottish security and intelligence capability could make Scotland an attractive environment for hostile intelligence organisations, and provide a route into the UK,’ the think tank warned. The report warned tensions between the governments of a separate Scotland and the rest of the UK could escalate as a result.","Alastair Darling claims the English should have a vote on currency union .

"By . Gerri Peev . Ed Miliband was told by one of his MPs to ‘get out more’ as his electoral strategy was condemned as suicidal. The Labour leader was hit with bruising criticism by his party’s rising star Simon Danczuk just days before local and European elections. Polls show Labour’s lead over the  Conservatives has fallen to four points, down from six. On European voting intentions, Labour is on 24 per cent, languishing behind Ukip (35 per cent) but ahead of the Conservatives (20 per cent). Bruising criticism: Ed Miliband and Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk at a dinner in 2012 . Mr Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, said the election had to be about  winning over Tory and Ukip voters. ‘I think Ed needs to be less cautious. He should have probably debated with Farage along with Nick Clegg. That would probably have been a smart move in terms of putting Cameron on the back foot. I also think he needs to get out more,’ he said. He told BBC Radio 5Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: ‘What we also need to do is occupy the centre ground and that is where we will get the breakthrough. 'So we need to be stronger on immigration; welfare. We need to be seen in a more positive way in relation to business.’ Mr Danczuk has criticised the strategy of Douglas Alexander, Mr Miliband’s campaign co-ordinator, to rely on securing 35 per cent of the popular vote. Mr Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, made his cutting remarks on BBC Radio 5Live days before local and European elections . This would be enough to win the  general election according to some strategists because constituency boundaries favour Labour. But Mr Danczuk has said Labour should not rely on the Coalition’s ‘unpopularity’ to win the 2015 contest. ‘Now we need to up our game,’ Mr Danczuk wrote in an article for the Mail on Sunday. He added that ‘continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer’, and warned that the party will not win by relying on a ‘core vote and a few disgruntled Liberals’ – which he described as ‘a suicidal strategy’. Mr Miliband is being threatened with further open dissent if his party does not gain seats in Thursday’s poll. A Labour candidate for one of the party’s target seats condemned his leadership as ‘dodgy and incoherent’. Tristan Osborne, candidate for Chatham and Aylesford, was recorded making critical remarks about Mr Miliband’s strategy. ‘The machine is not functioning in any capacity,’ Mr Osborne said at a £100-a-ticket Labour fundraising event held on Tuesday. ‘We need to be appealing to the aspirational Southern voter.’ Mr Miliband dismissed as  ‘nonsense’ suggestions that he had hired David Axelrod, Barack Obama’s election guru, to give him a makeover. Quizzed by Sky’s Dermot Murnaghan, he said: ‘This makeover stuff is nonsense...I can absolutely promise that I have never talked to David Axelrod about the colour of my tie.’ Mr Miliband also defended a Labour party TV ad which attacked David Cameron and Nick Clegg as out-of-touch posh boys. He insisted he was not waging class war based on which school the Prime Minister went to. ‘It is about what he believes and what he does,’ he said. The wheels came off Ed Miliband’s efforts to pick up votes in Newcastle – when the Labour leader picked up a parking ticket instead. Mr Miliband’s driver was given a fine while waiting for his boss in a loading bay during an election campaign visit last week. A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘The car should not have been parked in this bay. The fine has already been paid.’ Bookies will be hit with a new tax to fund future sports stars and anti-corruption  programmes if Labour wins the election. Ed Miliband promised to hit the gambling industry as it ‘puts nothing back’ into sports such as football, tennis and cricket, which earned it vast profits. But bookies hit back, saying they were already pouring millions into sport through TV rights and sponsorship.","Simon Danczuk hit Labour leader with bruising criticism on Radio 5Live .

They warn that ‘every one vote for the bill will mean a loss of hundreds of votes at the next General Election’ Campaigners will be demonstrating in Old Palace Yard from noon until 2pm before going in to Parliament to meet with MPs. Campaigners raised fresh fears last night over the impact on families living near HS2. They pointed to a clause in the small print of the bill, which gives a ‘right of entry’ to anyone nominated by the HS2 Ltd company to enter any property within 500 metres of the line. Former Tory whip Michael Fabricant, left, and newly appointed minister Andrea Leadsom, right, are prominent Tory opponents of the HS2 project . Richard Houghton of HS2 opposition group, HS2 Action Alliance said: ’A refusal to provide entry would be a criminal offence. This new power not only applies to the route of Phase 1 of HS2, but to any property near any other potential future high-speed line.’ He added: ‘This has massive implications. If you try to protect your property and stop the Government riding a coach and horses - or train - through your home or normal democratic planning application process requirements, then you could be jailed.’ Another clause (Clause 47) allows ministers to compulsorily purchase any land - anywhere - if they think it HS2 creates ‘an opportunity for regeneration or development’. Despite preparing for a bloody nose from backbenchers, Downing Street expects some ministers whose constituencies are crossed by the line to be conveniently away for the vote. Among those is David Lidington, the minister for Europe, who is delivering a lecture in Estonia. Newly appointed Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom has also been a vocal opponent of HS2 before her promotion to government, calling the case for it ‘questionable’ and ‘rapidly deteriorating’. Michael Fabricant, a former Tory whip and leading rebel, said backbenchers would have come out in much greater force had Labour not said it would push the bill through. Between 80 to 100 of his fellow MPs have ‘really serious doubts’ about the £50 billion London to the Midlands and the North line, he said. ‘Only 30 or 40 will rebel but I can tell you 80 to 100 people have really serious doubts,’ he said.But the Lichfield Tory said several MPs were reluctant to ‘use up our stocks’ with the party’s whips when the project is expected to clear its second reading thanks to support from Labour. ‘If Labour was against it then the rebellion would be a lot bigger than 40...it’d be double the amount of rebellion that we’ve got now,’ he told Sky’s Murnaghan. ‘People are saying, ‘Well, if it’s going to go through anyway why use up our stocks with the whips?’ Former Tory Welsh secretary Cheryl Gillan who has tabled amendments to block the Bill and will vote against it added: ’The business case doesn’t stack up.’ Former Tory Welsh secretary Cheryl Gillan who has tabled amendments to block the Bill and will vote against it . But she conceded: ’There is no doubt that with all three parties whipped to support HS2, there is no chance to stop it. But I have to register opposition on behalf of the many people who do not want this project.’ Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has the HS2 line running through his North West Leicestershire constituency said the issue is ‘toxic for the Conservative Party’ and predicted Labour would ‘ditch’ its support three months before the General Election. But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said ahead of tonight’s vote that the country had ‘waited long enough’ for a high speed line. It was time to stop ducking the decision, he added. The former chief whip compared rebels to those opposing the West Coast Mainline nearly 200 years ago. Parliament rejected the initial bill in 1832 because some people objected to the railway north of London. Ed Miliband's Labour Party have pledged to back the legislation . A year later, it was finally passed. Mr McLoughlin attacked the strategy of ‘incremental change’ by simply ‘patching up’ transport needs. ‘Cities and towns in the Midlands and the North deserve better. Scotland deserves better Britain deserves better. That is why I support High Speed Two. A new north-south railway line.’ He said his support came with ‘much humility’ and ‘not a little caution’ but also confidence Labour Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh defended her party’s support saying: ‘Labour is supporting HS2 to cut congestion on the railways, better connect our great cities and help deliver a One Nation economic recovery’. The TaxPayers’ Alliance urged MPs to oppose the Bill and expressed ‘severe concerns about the cost and value of the HS2 project’ which it said will cost every family in the country more than £1,500. TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ‘We call on the Government – and Opposition parties – to vote against this Bill. ‘It’s unbelievable that this wasteful vanity project has been allowed to proceed so far despite its flimsy business case. ‘The project should be abandoned now before any more taxpayers’ cash is squandered on what risks being the most expensive white elephant of all time.’ The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) urged MPs to ‘abstain’ from the Second reading vote saying ‘we are not convinced the case has been made for High Speed 2 (HS2) in its current form.’ A report by the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs said claimed Government benefits to the North were ‘a myth’. But business backed the scheme. Dr Adam Marshall, executive director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said: ‘HS2 must proceed. Parliament must progress the scheme quickly, to ensure the benefits are felt before overcrowding, delays and cancellations become the norm rather than the exception.’ Preparatory work on HS2 is set to start in 2016 ahead of building work in 2017. The first phase from London Euston to Birmingham will be completed by 2026, with an ‘accelerated’ section to Crewe finished the following year and the full route to Manchester and Leeds the North by 2030.","The MPs will rebel at the second reading of the HS2 Hybrid Bill .

"By . Gerri Peev . Immigrants should be allowed to move their extended families to the UK more easily, the Liberal Democrats will say. They are to propose that rules should be changed so that it is less difficult for the spouses and elderly grandparents of migrants to move to Britain. The plan to water down immigration rules will be unveiled at the Lib Dems’ current spring conference in York. Border control at Heathrow: A new proposal by the Liberal Democrats would make it easier for migrants to bring their spouses and grandparents to live with them in the United Kingdom . Activists have criticised the Government’s recent decision to raise the earning threshold from £18,600 to £22,400 before a migrant can bring their husband or wife to the UK, saying nearly half the population would not meet this criteria. Other proposals include allowing ageing relatives to join their migrant children in the UK for up to two years through a new grandparent ‘super visa’. The party says the policy could benefit wealthier immigrants, who would pay a health levy before their parents could join them to cover the increased health and social costs to Britain. The Lib Dems’ policy paper on migration says: ‘Our current system does not allow foreign grandparents to visit their families for an extended period. Countries such as Canada have introduced an extended tourist visa for these circumstances. ‘Allowing elderly relatives who can be adequately supported to visit enables them to spend time with their families, and makes Britain a more attractive place to settle for those highly skilled and wealthy migrants who benefit our economy.’ 'Migrants have enriched Britain': Lib Dems, led by MP Sir Andrew Stunell, will also discuss removing foreign students from immigration targets . Asylum seekers who have been in Britain for more than six months would be given the right to work, it adds. Foreign students who graduate in science, maths, engineering or technology would also be allowed to stay and work for three years after completing their course. The suggestion will spark fears that more migrants would compete with British graduates already struggling to find jobs in a tight market. The Lib Dems’ plans fly in the face of public concern over escalating levels of immigration, which jumped by 60,000 to 220,000 last year. Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘This once again shows the Lib Dems are out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people across the country. Since 2010 the Conservatives have taken tough measures to reverse Labour’s decade of uncontrolled mass immigration and take back control of our borders. ‘Now the Lib Dems want to re-open the door to uncontrolled immigration.’ Lib Dems, led by MP Sir Andrew Stunell, will also discuss removing foreign students from overall immigration targets. However, the party also wants all migrants to learn English, and for exit controls to be introduced at borders to monitor the numbers leaving the UK. In its policy motion, Sir Andrew writes: ‘For generations, migrants have enriched Britain’s culture, language and society and brought innovation, economic growth and increased prosperity for the whole country.’ Issan Ghazni, chairman of the Ethnic Minority Liberal Democrats, recently urged his party to woo the voters of EU migrants ahead of the European elections. EU citizens can vote in the UK in the European and local elections. ■ Lib Dems will fight for the income tax threshold to be raised by a further £250 to £12,500, Danny Alexander will announce tomorrow. Government-approved porn filters would stop adults accessing ‘educational’ and legitimate websites, the Lib Dems have claimed. The party condemned the online safety blocks, campaigned for by the Daily Mail and endorsed by the Prime Minister, which strive to protect youngsters from hardcore material. Major internet service providers have agreed that families should have to ‘opt-in’ to being able to access hardcore websites at home. But Lib Dem activists will be urged to back a motion critical of the filters at their conference tomorrow. A policy motion on a Digital Bill of Rights, moved by party president Tim Farron, said filters will give parents ‘a false sense of security’. Mr Farron first floated the idea of overturning the porn filters in January. Child safety experts and MPs called the move ‘irresponsible’, but Mr Farron insisted filters were ‘misconceived, ineffective and illiberal’. He warned that ‘essential sites’ on gay rights would be blocked, adding: ‘If the Prime Minister wanted to protect children from inappropriate material, he’d ensure they had access to good sexual health and relationship education.’","New policy proposal set to be unveiled at Lib Dem spring conference .

"By . Gerri Peev . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is thought to be preparing to make a donation to the Labour party . Tony Blair is preparing to make a large donation to the Labour Party as it struggles to build up its election fighting fund. The former Prime Minister, whose personal fortune is estimated in tens of millions of pounds, is in talks with Ed Miliband's officials  about making a major contribution to party coffers. The Daily Mail understands from friends of Mr Blair that he is in discussions about the ‘various ways he can best continue to support the Labour Party’. Providing cash would be one of the most welcome. However Labour activist Jon Lansman said the party should not accept money from Mr Blair – who has accepted contracts from questionable regimes around the world – saying it was ‘not the cleanest’ in politics. He added that Mr Blair’s client list included ‘the well-known democracies of Kuwait, Kazakhstan and Qatar’. Friends of Mr Blair have tried to play . down expectations of a possible donation, pointing out the huge costs . associated with running his business empire and various charities. A . spokesman for Mr Miliband refused to confirm whether talks had taken . place, saying: ‘Donations will be disclosed in the usual way.’ But he . added: ‘Of course all support is welcome’. Labour is set to lose millions after leader Ed Miliband was forced to weaken the link between trade unions and funding. Affiliated union members will no longer automatically pay into Labour party coffers. Instead, they will have to ‘opt in’. The move will cost Labour £7 million if just ten per cent of levy payers opt in to paying, or £4 million if half do. Mr Blair has previously made donations to Labour but his cash gifts have been small – just £6,000 in 2012 and 2009. He also gave a ‘non-cash’ donation of £76,000 in 2010 related to staff support. Lord Levy, Mr Blair’s former chief fundraiser, said Labour had no choice but to seek private donors. He said that the reforms to union funding meant that ‘I don’t think they’ve got any option. Is it something Ed Miliband is in love with? No, I don’t think it is. Will he have to do it? Yes, I think he will’. The former PM has already had secret talks with the party about making a ‘large donation’ according to The New Statesman magazine. But the ongoing hacking trial involving former News of the World Editor Rebekah Brooks could make the donation controversial. It emerged that Mr Blair had texted Mrs Brooks offering his support following the outcry over the hacking of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s phone. Mr Blair sent a message saying: ‘Is there anything I can do to help you. Thinking of you.’ Others in the party also have concerns that the Chilcott inquiry into the Iraq war has not yet given its verdict. The Labour party needs to find more cash after Ed Miliband secured agreement on reforming links to the unions last weekend . It could give a damning indictment of Mr Blair’s involvement in the 2003 invasion. Relations between Mr Miliband and Mr Blair have thawed in recent days, after the former PM praised the union reforms. Mr Blair said: ‘Ed has shown real courage and leadership on this issue. It is a long overdue reform that… was something I should have done myself. It puts individual people in touch with the party and is a great way of showing how Labour can reconnect with the people of Britain.’ A spokesman for Mr Miliband refused to confirm whether talks had taken place, saying: ‘Donations will be disclosed in the usual way.’ He added however that: ‘Of course all support is welcome’. Mr Blair’s office did not respond to the Mail’s queries. It also emerged yesterday that Mr Blair . has received £500,000 from taxpayers since stepping down as Prime . Minister  in 2007 – £230,000 in public duty cost allowance from 2011 . until 2013, and £270,000 previously. Gordon Brown, Sir John Major and . Baroness Thatcher also received the allowance which reimburses . ex-premiers for costs incurred fulfilling public duties associated with . their former office.","Former Prime Minister preparing to make sizable gift to Labour .

"By . Gerri Peev . and Tim Shipman . Nick Clegg faces the embarrassment of being hauled in front of a Commons committee to explain why taxpayers are paying his election strategist’s six-figure salary. South African Ryan Coetzee’s £110,000 pay cheque is the highest of any of the Deputy Prime Minister’s special advisers. His official title is head of strategy and he spends much of his time advising Mr Clegg on how to boost the Lib Dems’ dismal poll ratings and refining their media messaging. 'Serious questions to answer': Nick Clegg faces the embarrassment of being hauled in front of a Commons committee to explain why taxpayers are paying his election strategist Ryan Coetzee's (right) six-figure salary . But he is also a key player in the party’s General Election strategy and the Lib Dems may be asked to explain his salary to the Commons public administration select committee. Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the committee, said: ‘There is absolutely no doubt that a party pollster or election strategist should be paid for by the party, as is the case with (Tory election guru) Lynton Crosby. 'If someone has been appointed as a Spad (special adviser) at taxpayers’ expense but is doing this work even on the side, during the working day, then my committee will have questions to ask about who approved this appointment and how it could possibly continue.’ Speaking out: Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the Commons committee, said there is 'absolutely no doubt' that election strategists should be paid for by their parties . David Cameron’s chief election co-ordinator Mr Crosby is paid out of Tory Party funds, while the Labour Party has to ask the unions to pay its hired guns. Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: ‘There are now very serious questions for Nick Clegg to answer over whether Mr Coetzee has been working on Lib Dem election strategy while being paid to perform official government duties. ‘If the Lib Dems are using the public payroll to support their party political activity, this would be a breach of the rules and an abuse of public trust. ‘The public will expect urgent reassurances that the important role played by special advisers isn’t being exploited by Lib Dems desperate to improve their woeful ratings.’ Some Lib Dem MPs believe Mr Coetzee will soon have to be paid directly by the party, rather than from the public purse, before next year’s election. Asked if that should happen now, Mr Clegg said yesterday he could not see a problem with the arrangement. ‘We’ve done it by the book and it’s not unusual for politicians in government to get support on what are the main concerns of the British public and how can we address them in government. That’s exactly what we’re doing.’ A spokesman for Mr Clegg later insisted that Mr Coetzee fully complied with the code of conduct for special advisers. Online presence: Mr Coetzee seems to spend much of his time on Twitter discussing South African politics, cricket and rugby. He has also shown an irreverence online, declaring: 'I am a big fan of the odd drunk tweet' Jibe: In a jibe at British Olympian Mo Farah, the father-of-one tweeted after the London marathon: 'Wouldn't mind watching an interview with the actual winner of the race. Have only seen one with the guy who came 8th' ‘A key part of his role as director of . strategy is to ensure that all government messaging strictly reflects . the Lib Dems and Lib Dem priorities. ‘He is a special adviser so he is paid out of public funds. The salaries are all transparent and published on the internet.’ The spokesman did not say what sort of visa Mr Coetzee had come into the country on but insisted ‘he clearly has the right to work here – he is employed by the UK government’. Mr Coetzee is seen as being much more involved in election strategy than his predecessor, Richard Reeves, and has presented his polling analysis to MPs and activists on Lib Dem ‘away days’. Contrast: David Cameron's chief election co-ordinator Lynton Crosby (pictured) is paid out of Tory Party funds . Despite being popular with other Lib Dem advisers and ministers, he has reaped criticism from some in the party. Lord Greaves, a Lib Dem peer, has said . the party’s elections strategy should ‘set out a programme for . government based on what Liberal Democrats stand for – policies rooted . in principles and Liberal ideology’. He added that many in the party will be pitted against ‘those who will follow the party’s newly risen saviour, “he who must be obeyed” Ryan Coetzee.’ He said Mr Coetzee’s ideas were devised ‘from his hundreds of spreadsheet pages purporting to tell us what our target 20 per cent of the electorate think about everything from the immigration of Bulgarians to funding for tiddlywinks tournaments in Tooting’. A former MP for the left-of-centre Democratic Alliance in South Africa, father-of-one Mr Coetzee seems to spend much of his time on Twitter discussing South African politics, cricket and rugby. He has also shown an irreverence on Twitter, declaring: ‘I’ve watched about 2 minutes of the Pistorius trial. Unfortunately I keep getting asked about it as if I’m an expert witness of some sort.’ In another tweet, he said: ‘I am a big fan of the odd drunk tweet. For better or for worse. Life’s a bit short to be interminally [sic] sober.’ In a jibe at British Olympian Mo Farah, he tweeted after the London marathon: ‘Wouldn’t mind watching an interview with the actual winner of the race.

"By . Gerri Peev . Plans: Nick Clegg plans to create communities with at least 15,000 homes across the South of England . Families living in new garden cities would be encouraged to grow their own food in allotments under plans drawn up by Nick Clegg. The Deputy Prime Minister wants to create planned communities with at least 15,000 homes each across the South of England centred around large garden plots. His vision of the modern ‘Good Life’ was unveiled yesterday after years of wrangling with the Tories. A document for ‘locally-led garden cities’ said they should provide ‘opportunities for residents to grow their own food, including generous allotments’. Aides later said this would encourage ‘sustainability’ and that surveys showed people valued allotments and growing their own vegetables. Ministers will start working on plans for three garden cities by the end of August. Mr Clegg vowed to cut help remove planning red tape and secure a share of the £2.4 billion funding for private developers. But officials have stressed that the garden cities must be backed by local residents to get the go ahead. Garden cities would not be ‘imposed’ on areas and they would ensure ‘public services, green spaces and amenities are hard-wired into designs from the beginning.’ Mr Clegg has argued that his garden cities would be better than ‘highly contentious’ developments on the outskirts of towns and cities. There was an ‘ark of prosperity’ stretching from Oxford to Cambridge where many people wanted to live but were unable to find or afford houses. He named Bicester in Oxfordshire as one such place and officials have also pointed to Cranbrook in East Devon, Wokingham in Surrey and Didcot in Oxfordshire. ‘People are starting to understand, particularly in that ark of prosperity that goes from Oxford right through to Cambridge, where more and more people want to live but simply can’t live at the moment or are totally priced out of the housing market altogether, one way of making sure that more families can live there, more people work there, more kids can go to school... is to plan it properly through garden cities.’ He argued we need developments like Welwyn Garden City when residents will grow their own foods . He rejected an accusation from National Trust director Dame Helen Ghosh that councils are being ‘hustled’ into allowing development on greenfield land by central Government. Mr Clegg said: ‘The point for those who care about the countryside is to ask oneself ‘is the best way to protect our countryside a rash of often rather unplanned, highly contentious encroachments on to our countryside as existing developments are extended?’ ‘That’s what’s been going on for years. It creates huge local controversy and aggravation, it leads as well to housing developments which are not supported adequately by the right transport infrastructure, school infrastructure or local amenities and shops. ‘My point has always been, let’s return to the genius of the people who have the vision of saying ‘we need a Milton Keynes, we need a Welwyn Garden City, we need Hatfield’.’ Green belt development was at its lowest in 20 years, he said. Hilary Benn, Labour’s shadow communities secretary, said: ‘After four wasted years of empty and over-hyped announcements on garden cities it is only now that ministers have got around to inviting bids for development. 'We need a new Milton Keynes' he told people gathered at a launch of his new community . 'This Tory-led Government has presided over the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s and the publication of this long-delayed document is far too little, too late. ‘Ministers’ failure to take the real action needed to tackle the housing crisis will mean that home ownership remains out of reach of many low and middle-income earners, rents will continue to rise and waiting lists will grow ever longer.’ John Rowley, planning officer for the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, said: 'CPRE’s Planning Officer said garden cities should only be built on previously developed sites with good rail access. 'We must seek to minimise the unnecessary loss of greenfield land that is so important for quality of life, food production and flood management.’ Tory peer and Next tycoon Lord Wolfson, who is offering a £250,000 prize for ideas on how to build a new garden city, welcomed the plans. He said garden cities would ‘take pressure off London’s Green Belt and valuable countryside like the Chilterns, as well as preventing unplanned incremental edge-of-village development across the South East’.","Deputy Prime Minister unveiled plan for new homes across South England .

"By . Gerri Peev . Sajid Javid (pictured with wife Laura) said immigrants should respect British culture which means learning the language . Migrants to Britain should be able to speak English and ‘respect its laws and culture’, the UK’s most senior Asian politician has said. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid insisted it was not good enough for migrants to live in the UK for up to 50 years without being able to speak English. The British-born Tory, whose parents came from Pakistan, also said there was no place for Sharia law in the UK legal system. Mr Javid, a rising star at Westminster who has also taken on the role of Equalities Minister, suggested voters had legitimate concerns over immigration. He said: ‘People want Britain to have more control over its borders and I think they are right. ‘People also say, when immigrants do come to Britain, that they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should also respect our way of life and I agree with all of that. ‘It means things like trying to learn English. I know people myself, I have met people who have been in Britain for over 50 years and they still can’t speak English. ‘I think it’s perfectly reasonable for British people to say, “Look, if you’re going to settle in Britain and make it your home you should learn the language of the country and you should respect its laws and its culture”,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph. The Coalition has introduced English language tests for non-EU citizens who want to settle in the UK. But a Daily Mail investigation revealed how the system was being undermined by fraudsters selling fake English language certificates for £500. Mr Javid said Ukip leader Nigel Farage was right to respond to public concerns over immigration. ‘Many people throughout Britain are concerned about excessive immigration,’ he said. ‘Politicians do need to respond to those concerns.’ The Bromsgrove MP added that people should have a right to practise Sharia law amid reports that special community courts had been set up in London, Birmingham, Bradford and Manchester. Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said British Muslims should oppose the belief that converting from Islam is punishable by death . ‘Where people want to have their own private arrangements between them, that is a matter for them... but there is no place for Sharia law in British law,’ said Rochdale-born Mr Javid, 44, a former banker. He said he would pass Lord Tebbit’s controversial ‘cricket test’ – suggested as a way of gauging ‘loyalty’ for those with immigrant backgrounds – as he had always backed  England in the sport. The father of four made history last month by becoming the first Asian man in the Cabinet. He has previously said: ‘My own family’s heritage is Muslim. Myself and my four brothers were brought up to believe in God, but I do not practise any religion. My wife is a practising Christian and the only religion practised in my house is Christianity.’ Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said British Muslims should oppose the belief that converting from Islam is punishable by death. He spoke out after an Islamic court in Sudan sentenced Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, a pregnant woman, to be executed for being a Christian. Lord Carey won support from Inayat Bunglawala, chairman of Muslims4UK, who said: ‘It is so tragic that in the 21st century someone can still be sentenced to death for wanting to change their religion.’","Sajid Javid sympathised with voters who have concerns over immigration .

"By . Gerri Peev . The Deputy Prime Minister insisted he planned to lead the party until 2020 - but his team gave three possible dates he could step down . Nick Clegg sparked frenzied speculation about the Lib Dem leadership last night after failing to give a clear answer on when he might stand down. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted he planned to lead the party until 2020 – but only after his team had put forward three different possibilities as to when he will quit. The farcical mixed message came amid growing speculation that Danny Alexander and Vince Cable are manoeuvring to replace him. Mr Clegg’s aides first indicated that he would fight the next election and remain leader ‘beyond’ 2015 – giving no further guarantees. But sources close to Mr Clegg then suggested he would quit as leader if the Lib Dems were not part of a coalition government in 2015. When asked whether Mr Clegg would stay on as leader until 2020, a spokesman for the Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘If the Liberal Democrats are back in government again then Nick Clegg intends to serve a full term.’ Mr Clegg’s office then tried to backtrack, with his spokesman saying: ‘Our entire focus is on delivering Liberal Democrat priorities in government and then getting the Liberal Democrats back into government in 2015.’ But the spokesman also noted that Mr Clegg was ‘only 47’ – a clear nod to him being able to embark on a second career, perhaps as an EU commissioner. His intention to quit the leadership if it did not come with the trappings of power that come with the Deputy Prime Ministership threatened to overshadow his keynote speech to the party’s spring conference. Three hours later, after frantic talks behind the scenes, Mr Clegg’s office adopted yet another position. They tried to quell the leadership speculation, insisting: ‘Nick Clegg intends to be the leader of the Liberal Democrats today, tomorrow and into the 2015 election and through the whole of the next parliament. The farcical mixed message came amid growing speculation that Danny Alexander (left) and Vince Cable are manoeuvring to replace Clegg . 'He intends to be leader of the Liberal Democrats whether or not we are in government.’ But the backtracking came after Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, emerged as one of the front-runners to replace him. He will have to fight off competition from Left-wing party president Tim Farron, who is popular with activists, and Business Secretary Vince Cable, who is the most recognisable Lib Dem apart from Mr Clegg. Leading Liberal Democrats believe Mr Alexander’s high profile in recent weeks is part of a concerted effort by Team Clegg to position his protégé as a possible replacement. Mr Alexander – who has recently had a makeover, ditching his glasses and hiring a media adviser – has been reappointed to lead negotiations in the event of another hung parliament. Asked on Sky’s Murnaghan programme if he wanted the top job, Mr Alexander refused to rule himself out, saying: ‘There’s no vacancy, I hope there isn’t a vacancy for many years to come. Nick Clegg is doing a fantastic job, I’ve got a big job to do.’ Mr Cable is understood to view Mr Alexander’s ambitions with incredulity and still fancies his chances of the top job. ‘Vince has been dormant, but he can erupt again,’ one Lib Dem observer noted.","Deputy PM says he plans to lead Liberal Democrats until 2020 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . The badly decomposed body of an elderly woman has been discovered in her flat where she lay undiscovered for six years. Anne Leitrim, who was in her 70s, had not been seen since 2008 and neighbours had assumed she moved out of the area because her home appeared empty. Incredibly, two windows to the ground floor flat had remained opened in all that time. Shocking: The body of a pensioner lay undiscovered in a Bournemouth house for six years, as neighbours assumed she'd moved out of the area . Access: Incredibly, Mrs Leitrim's body lay undiscovered despite windows to the property being open . Mrs Leitrim's modest home is in a block of eight flats and even backs on to a communal garden that is regularly used. Residents at the flats in Bournemouth, Dorset, joked it looked so abandoned there could be a body in it, unaware Mrs Leitrim was dead inside. Her remains were finally found when bailiffs visited the property in the 1980s-built block to collect unpaid debts. After getting no answer at the door they got into the property through one of the open windows and made the grim discovery. Shocked neighbours have spoken of feeling guilty that it had taken such a long period of time for anyone to realise Mrs Leitrim was dead. They described her as being friendly and softly spoken with a Scottish accent. John Stanley, 55, who has lived in the building in the Throop area of Bournemouth for the eight years, said: ‘Everyone is so shocked. Tragic: Anne Leitrim, who was in her 70s, had not been seen since 2008 . ‘We didn't think anyone was living in the flat. Her car went and we just thought she had moved out. ‘There are cobwebs in the windows and we used to joke there could be a body inside but we had no idea. ‘When the bailiffs and locksmiths came to the flat they entered the property through two windows that had been left ajar. ‘The windows were slightly open and they used a coat hanger to get inside. ‘The locksmith went in and said 'I think there's a body'. It was so decomposed he couldn't tell.’ Shock: Neighbours including Ruth Evans (left) and Debbie Small (right) have spoke of their horror at the discovery . Ruth Evans, 59, who has lived in the building for six years, added: ‘It makes me feel guilty. You think of all the times we were out in the garden and she was just lying there. ‘When her car disappeared we all thought she had moved away. When I heard there was a body inside I couldn't believe it.’ Debbie Small, who has lived in the same street for two years, said: ‘It is really sad. It is a really friendly street and we all know each other. I can't believe it.’ Neighbour Mr Stanley said: 'Bailiffs arrived on Tuesday because she had been defaulting on her mortgage payments since May last year. 'It turned out she had been making automatic payments from her bank account for four years after she died. 'To think she has been lying there all this time is heartbreaking. 'She was lying on the floor next to the bed with her hand over her chest. They think she probably had a heart attack.' Mr Stanley revealed the residents of the other flats in the block held garden parties right outside Mrs Lietrim's flat without realising she lay dead. He added: 'It is absolutely tragic and has left us all in shock. She used to keep herself to herself and no-one really knew her very well. 'She drove a red car and then one day it just wasn't here any more. We all assumed she had moved out and didn't think any more about it. 'I'd never seen any family or friends visiting her, and the only person who ever approached her door was the postman. Last year TV presenter Esther Rantzen set up the charity The Silver Line - a free phoneline for old people who are lonely. A spokesman for the charity said it was a 'sad and shocking' case. Charity Contact the Elderly, which says it offers a vital lifeline of friendship to those aged 75 and over, who live alone, said it has declared a state-of-emergency in the UK as the number of socially isolated older people reaches breaking point. A new study conducted by Qa Research reveals that almost one in five (19 per cent) of the older people Contact the Elderly supports joined the charity because they rarely saw another person. Contact the Elderly Founder and Chairman, Trevor Lyttleton MBE, said: 'Loneliness amongst older people has reached a state of emergency and must not be ignored. For almost 50 years we have been focussing on providing a cost-effective solution, yet the demand for our service has never been so high. 'We know our formula of tea and conversation works, but we simply cannot reach out to the people that desperately need our help without increased volunteers and funding.' A spokesman for Bournemouth coroner's office said formal identification of the body had not taken place. They said a post mortem examination will be attempted but it is highly unlikely to identify a cause of death. It is thought they have been in contact with Mrs Leitrim's next of kin. A spokesman from Dorset Police said the death is not being treated as suspicious.","Anne Leitrim, who was in her 70s, hadn't been seen since 2008 .

"By . Andy Dolan . An engineer hanged himself  days after a controversial group of ‘paedophile hunters’ accused him of grooming a child over the internet. Gary Cleary was arrested by police after being confronted in public by the vigilante group called Letzgo Hunting whose members lure suspected sex offenders into meetings by posing as young girls online. The 29-year-old, who lived with his girlfriend, was released on bail while officers looked into the allegation, but was found dead in the garage at his home four days later. A coroner last week recorded a verdict of suicide. Scroll down for video . Trap: A suspect runs from a member of Letzgo Hunting who lure suspected sex offenders into meetings by posing as young girls online . Mr Cleary lived with Melissa Andrews . and their dog at Newbold Verdon, Leicestershire. A relative of college . worker Miss Andrews said: ‘It’s a tragedy and has left everyone . extremely upset. The family have been told by the police that their . investigation is still ongoing.’ The relative, who asked not to be . named, went on to criticise the actions of Letzgo Hunting. He said: ‘I . think it is a sad reflection on modern life that vigilantes are . operating under cover of the internet. It puts the country back 300 . years.’ Miss Andrews, 30, was unavailable for comment. Letzgo Hunting, which was set up by a . group of concerned parents earlier this year, has achieved a high . profile after posting videos of members confronting suspected . paedophiles on the internet. It has created dozens of profiles on dating and social networking websites pretending to be girls aged 12 to 15. Chase: The footage of the suspect running away was posted by the vigilante group on YouTube . The group then exchanges messages with . those it considers to be ‘interested’ men, sometimes for weeks, before . luring them into meetings in parks or other public areas and filming the . confrontations. The footage is uploaded on to Letzgo . Hunting’s website and Facebook page, as well as YouTube, initially with . the alleged suspects’ faces visible. If an arrest is made, the images are . taken down and doctored, so the men can no longer be identified, before . being uploaded once more. Last night Letzgo Hunting’s founder . told the Daily Mail he has no regrets about the group’s actions, and . said they will continue to work to expose ‘people who pose a risk to . children’. The man, who used to call himself . Scummbuster but now likes to be known as Jamie, said: ‘We are convinced . this man was a danger to children, that is why we arranged to meet him. ‘Plenty of people we come into contact . with only want to talk dirty with our online ‘‘decoys’’ but he wanted . to take things further. We feel sorry for his family for the loss of . their son but our work will continue.’ Group: The website of 'Letzgo Hunting', a group of 'paedophile hunters' who confronted a 29-year-old who killed himself after he was arrested . Mr Cleary was confronted in Braunstone Park, Leicester, four months ago. As he walked across the grass to meet . an 18-year-old ‘decoy’ who Letzgo Hunting say he believed to be a . 14-year-old, he was confronted by two men from the group. They say they asked him why he was . meeting an under-aged girl with a sexual motive but he fled, swearing at . the men, before they could even tell him who they were. He was arrested . a few days later, on May 9, after detectives were handed footage of the . meeting. He was released on bail, before being found dead on May 13. A spokesman for Leicestershire Police . would not confirm Mr Cleary’s name but said the man who went on to kill . himself was arrested following information which was supplied by a . ‘third party’. He added: ‘He was questioned and released on police bail. He was not charged with any criminal offence. ‘On May 13 we were called to his . address and discovered his body.’ Earlier this year the force warned . that such vigilante activity could ‘seriously affect the chances of . success in court, preventing victims from getting justice’. During Mr Cleary’s inquest in . Loughborough last Thursday, coroner Trevor Kirkman did not refer to any . encounter with Letzgo Hunting or his arrest. Direct action: Letzgo Hunting's website says that the police are failing communities so they take gathering evidence into their own hands to get arrests . But he told his parents David, 65, and . Susan, 62, who declined to comment after the hearing: ‘This is not a . court in which one apportions blame as such and nobody is on trial, . still less your son. ‘Whatever may have occurred, or whatever may be thought to have occurred, is not a matter I need to go into. ‘What I have to deal with is how he . came by his death and the means by which he came by his death. I am . satisfied I should record that he came by his death at his own hands. ‘Whatever may have happened, the people who are left to pick up the pieces are those that love him.’ ‘Jamie’ from Letzgo Hunting, who . claims to work in the security industry, has previously explained that . he decided to create the group with close friends in the Hinckley area . of Leicestershire after someone he knew was convicted of offences . against a child and possession of indecent images of children. He said the group posts profiles of . teenage minors on dating and social networking websites such as Badoo – . where he said Mr Cleary was found – and Bebo. He said the first thing . Letzgo Hunting ‘decoys’ did when they got into a conversation with a man . online was to say: ‘I am only 14.’ Mr Cleary’s parents declined to . comment at their home near Leicester. A neighbour said: ‘They’re . devastated.’ Work: The group's confrontations have led to 12 arrests, but nobody has been charged, Leicestershire Police say .

"By . John Drayton . Garth Crooks has taken aim at 'indiscreet' Harry Redknapp's claims that certain England players during his time at Tottenham tried to find ways of skipping international duty. Writing on his Kick It Out blog, former Spurs favourite Crooks said players who can't handle the pressure of playing for England deserved Redknapp's 'protection and discretion'. Instead Redknapp treated these 'deep psychological fears' like 'cocktail-party gossip.' Hitting out: Garth Crooks has written that Harry Redknapp was 'indiscreet' in his remarks about England players who shirked international duty when at Tottenham . Claims: Harry Redknapp said in an interview there were certain England players at Tottenham who tried to shirk international duty . The Queens Park Rangers manager criticised the commitment of young English players to the national team in an interview with BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme last week. He highlighted experiences of managing England players while in charge of Tottenham, claiming there were 'two or three' who did not want to go away with the national team. Redknapp recalled: 'They would come to me 10 days before the game and say, 'Gaffer, get me out of that game, I don't want to play in that game'. That was how it was. I'd say, 'you're playing for your country, you should want to play'. '(They would say) 'Nah, my girlfriend is having a baby in four weeks, I don't want to play' and that is the truth, so it makes you wonder.' Shirked responsibility: Redknapp said that when Tottenham manager, two or three England players would look for excuses to get out of international games . When challenged, Redknapp, who was strongly linked with the England job following the departure of Fabio Capello, refused to identify the players in question. And now Crooks has condemned Redknapp's remarks, saying the players in question did not deserve such 'vilification.' He wrote: 'The revelations made by Harry Redknapp last week, apart from being outrageously indiscreet, touched on this very point. 'Coping with pressure has always been a fundamental part of playing at the highest level. Pressure point: Crooks argues that England players wanting to pull out of fixtures is a sign they have a psychological problem . 'However, if certain England players go to their club manager asking them to be pulled out of an international fixture because they can’t cope with the pressure, then they deserve his protection and  discretion, not vilification. 'By a player announcing he’s not big enough for the occasion in the same way a player might refuse to take a penalty in a shoot-out, it should not to be used in order to sell a few more newspapers or as a baseball bat to take revenge on a player who may have let you down in some capacity in the past. 'These revelations are deep psychological fears and for a manager to treat them like cocktail-party gossip is appalling.'","Redknapp claimed in BBC interview certain England players tried to skip international duty when he managed Tottenham .

"By . James  Nye . The man suspected to be the Swiss cheese pervert was arrested at his home in Philadelphia on Thursday at gunpoint. Christopher Pagano was taken into custody by Norristown police after an investigation by authorities led them to believe he was the man harassing local women. The 41-year-old has allegedly been driving around town and approaching women asking them if they would like to pleasure his genitals with a slice of Swiss cheese. 'He was a weirdo,' neighbor Rae Dean told NBC10's Deanna Durante. 'He used to come outside in his underwear with no shirt.' Hands up: Christopher Pagano was arrested at his home on Noble Street in Norristown on Thursday . The 41-year-old has allegedly been driving around town and approaching women asking them if they would like to pleasure his genitals with a slice of Swiss cheese. Double arrest: This is Chris Pagano - who was arrested in 2006 (left) and 2009 (right) for allegedly propositioning women on the street to pleasure him with blocks of Swiss cheese. Pagano has been linked to Philadelphia's Swiss Cheese Pervert . Sources at the Philadelphia Police . Department’s Special Victims Unit have indicated that Chris Pagano is . the 'subject' of their investigation and added that is was 'possible' an . arrest would be made after several women came forward to give . statements believed to be about the Norristown resident. This . comes as unearthed court documents and a mugshot from 2009 reveal that . Pagano, 41, was arrested after he allegedly 'removed a large block of . cheese from his pocket' and asked a woman on the street if it would be . alright to give her '$20 to rub the Swiss cheese on his penis.' However, . Pagano has denied that he is the man who has been driving around the . Mayfair area of Philadelphia in recent weeks propositioning women to . pleasure him with slices of cheese. At the time of his 2009 arrest, Pagano pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct but a solicitation charge against him was dismissed. A reporter from The Philadelphia Magazine traveled to Pagano's home on Wednesday morning to ask him if he was indeed the now infamous Swiss cheese pervert who has been terrorizing the Mayfair suburb of the city in recent weeks. Pictured by at least two victims, the fetishist has been described as an overweight man in his 40s who drives around in his car approaching women with his genitals exposed. According to his victims, he then dangles a large slice of Swiss cheese over his penis and offers to pay the women to perform sexual acts on him using the snack. Pagano, who is believed to be married, flatly denied being the Swiss cheese pervert, saying, 'I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sometimes people confuse me with somebody else.' However, the picture used by Pagano on his Facebook - which has now been set to private - and the pictured attached to an OkCupid profile message sent to a woman asking her to indulge his cheese craving are the same. More-so, mugshots have emerged of Pagano from arrests in 2006 and 2009 after separate incidents both involving cheese according to law enforcement sources who spoke to Philadelphia Magazine. Cheesy: The Mayfair Town Watch warned women of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert,' pictured, on its Facebook page earlier this year . An affidavit of probable cause given to the Norristown Police Department outlines a report of attempted sexual assault. A woman - who is not being identified - said that she was approached by a man approximately just after midnight and asked if she would have sex with him. 'The male removed a large block of cheese from his pocket and told [Ms. Doe] that he would pay her $20 to rub the swiss cheese on his penis. '[Ms. Doe] became alarmed and fled on foot toward her residence. The male offered [Ms. Doe] more money as she fled the area.' In the affidavit the woman 'identified Christopher Pagano as the person that asked her to place cheese on his penis.' Going back three years to 2006, Pagano was again arrested and charged with solicitation and disorderly conduct according to the Philadelphia Magazine. The Norristown Police Department was unable to confirm that cheese was involved in this incident, however detective James Angelucci, who worked the 2006 and 2009 case said that he thought it was. 'I was working the 2006 detail as well,' said Angelucci. 'And I believe cheese was on the menu, but I’m not completely sure. If my memory serves me, it was Swiss.' The Mayfair Town Watch warned local ladies of the lurking man on its Facebook page Saturday, and Philadelphia Police Department has confirmed the Special Victims Unit is investigating the curious case after several women filed reports describing a man with a 'major sexual cheese fetish.' 'I understand that people may think this is funny, but this is no laughing matter,' Milt Martelack, the town watch's senior adviser, told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'We've had a couple individuals reach out to us. We're taking this matter very seriously, and we're working vigorously with police to get this guy off the streets.' The 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' is heavyset and white and drives a silver or black sedan. Victim: A woman tweeted this picture of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' with the comment 'I met this dude a few weeks ago' #creep . The bizarre case shocked many residents but Gabby Chest, from nearby Bridesburg, recognized the fetish straight away and made her own report to police. In July 2012, when she was just 19, she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and within days had an inbox from a 'really strange guy' with a very specific request. 'He said he was looking for someone to perform masturbation on him with cheese,' Ms Chest told the Daily News. 'He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was to find someone to help him with them.' She added: 'There's no doubt it was him; it looked exactly like the picture on his profile. I was scared and shocked. I never thought the guys you see on those sites would be so close to me.' In the message, the man called 'Chris' explained he developed the fetish after struggling to find women and start relationships as a young man because he was overweight and always judged on his looks. 'So I developed this fetish to help me deal with my sexual urges,' he wrote. 'I found that women tend to like dairy products, and settled on cheese to represent the girl. thus I started having sex with cheese.' Another woman, commenting on a Phillymag.com story, shared an OKCupid message her sister received from 'Chris' some four years ago, which was even more shocking. 'I love the way Swiss cheese feels against my penis. Either as slices of Swiss cheese being wrapped around my penis or a chunk of Swiss cheese being rubbed against my penis,' he wrote. Swiss is best: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best,' 'Chris' wrote in an OKCupid message to a 19-year-old girl (stock photo) 'I love even more when a woman uses the Swiss cheese to pleasure me. Or simply wraps Swiss cheese slices around my penis and allows me to hang out with her as I wear the cheese.' He explained that he prefers having sex with cheese over traditional sex and jokes 'I am lucky I never became a rapist,' suggesting this was an alternative to his fromage infatuation. Chis went on: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best. First and foremost, if ever a picture of cheese is used, most of the time they use a representation of Swiss cheese. But also because of it's eye patterns, texture, and the way it feels against my penis.' While he didn't offer Ms Chest cash in exchange for the sexual favor, so as not to suggest she was a prostitute, he did offer this young woman $50 if she'd pleasure him using his preferred method. He described in the expansive letter, however, that when he was younger he had far more stamina for cheese sex. 'I was able to wrap and wear a good 1 ½ pounds of Swiss cheese against my penis, and wear the Swiss cheese for hours at a time, before I would climax from just having the Swiss cheese on my penis,' Chris wrote. But in a strange twist, he insists he doesn't like Swiss cheese, only mozzarella, and would never consumer the cheese he has used on himself. 'One last note, I do not like cheese, except for mozzarella, and that is the one cheese I have never used on myself,' he explained. 'So no I do not eat the cheese after I am done using it for pleasure, it is discarded. I am always asked that question.'","Police in Philadelphia arrested 41-year-old Chris Pagano today .

"By . Katy Winter . Former X Factor judge Tulisa appeared in court today for a hearing related to allegations that she arranged a drug deal. The former N-Dubz star, 25, is said to have been caught referring to cocaine as 'white sweets' during a newspaper sting. However causing as much of a stir as her ongoing legal woes was concern over the singer's face which appeared noticeably puffy and swollen as she walked into court. Scroll down for video . Tulisa arrived a Southwark Crown Court this morning for a hearing related to allegations that she arranged a drug deal . The difference between Tulisa's face between 2009 (left) and 2014 (right) is striking . Though she has previously denied having had a nose job and lip fillers, Tulisa's face is markedly different to the fresh-faced girl who burst onto the pop music scene in 2007. In addition to a change in shape of her nose and fuller lips, Tulisa's face appeared slightly 'pulled back' and swollen . The singer was keen to hide her plumped-up pout as she left a beauty salon in Central London in October last year. In August last year, she also put her slimmer looking nose down to the fact she had lost weight. Tulisa's face looked markedly swollen and puffy as she strolled into court this morning . She told the Mirror at the time: 'It's not a deliberate thing, and I really don't give a toss about being skinny. That's just not me. But when I lose weight it goes from my face, and everyone says my nose looks thinner. 'I swear on my life I've not had it done. I've literally just lost weight, and it goes from my nose!' Annemarie Gillett, Non Surgical Director from Transform Cosmetic Surgery commented: ‘Looking at the photos provided, Tulisa definitely looks like she has had some kind of temporary dermal filler to her lips and is a very popular treatment with women of Tulisa’s age. Tulisa’s lips looked thinner in earlier pictures. 'The elongated and shiny forehead is a classic tell-tale sign of having injectable wrinkle treatment. 'Her cheeks also look fuller than in earlier photographs. 'Her skin looks quite taut and shiny which would suggest Tulisa has had regular facial peels/skin rejuvenation treatments. 'It appears Tulisa has indulged in non-surgical treatments of late. However Tulisa is very young and less is more and I would encourage using less product and leaving more time in between treatments.' Cosmetic and plastic surgeon, Paul Banwell FRCS (Plast) from the Banwell Clinic says: 'I think Tulisa looks great but I can see the tell-tale signs of Botox, fillers in her lips and possibly in her cheeks too. 'She looks like she’s lost a bit of weight in her face as well which has made her lips look more sensuous and striking.' The former X Factor judge is accused of arranging a transaction between Sun on Sunday's undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood and her friend, Mike GLC, real name  Michael Coombs, 35. Tulisa is facing charges after a sting operation by the Sun on Sunday and she denies all charges . The alleged deal is said to have been arranged at London's Dorchester Hotel on May 10 last year. The singer arrived at Southwark Crown Court with her legs on display, wearing a smart navy dress with a white Peter Pan collar, and white cuffs on three-quarter length sleeves that bared her tattoo which reads ""The Female Boss"" tattoo. She had her straight dark hair pulled back into half pony-tail and teamed the outfit with nude patent heels. The outfit was reminiscent of the dress worn by Rebakah Brooks on June 18 to her own court case at the Old Bailey, where she was ultimately found not guilty. Tulisa's navy shift dress with white collar was similar to the out fir worn by Rebekah Brooks (pictured right with husband Charlie) last week . Tulisa, real name Tula Contostavlos, sat in the back row of the barristers' seats, listening intently to arguments her counsel advanced. Contostavlos, from Friern Barnet, North London, was allegedly snared by an investigation which saw the tabloid report that half an ounce of cocaine changed hands as a result of the deal with Mr Mahmood, sometimes known as the 'fake sheikh'. She denies one count of helping an undercover reporter obtain 0.5oz (13.9g) of cocaine for £860, while Coombs of Enfield, North London, denies one count of supplying a Class A drug. A provisional trial date has been set for July 14. In 2009 (left) and 2008 (right) Tulisa not only had blonde hair but also a soft and natural looking face . At the peak of N-Dubz fame (left, 2010, right 2011) Tulisa's face began to alter along with her hair colour . As well as deepening her tan and fostering a bad . girl image during her stint as an X Factor judge, Tulisa's face . continued to transform (left, 2012, right, 2013) At an appearance at court in January this year Tulisa's lips looked noticeably fuller . In March there were yet further differences to the singer's face, though she has always denied having surgery . Tulisa's face looked oddly swollen and full at court yesterday .

"By . Sarah Dean . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been mocked online after he posted a cringeworthy snap of him and 'true friend' Japanese leader Shinzo Abe posing in front of a giant tyre in Western Australia's Pilbara region. The embarrassing tourist-like snap shows Mr Abbott and Mr Abe standing with one leg up, a hand on their left knees, goggles on their eyes and a big grin on their faces, as they show off their shiny RM Williams boots. The photo comes after Mr Abbott was accused of being hungover on live TV after he spent the night drinking wine with Mr Abe at a formal dinner at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday night. Cringe: Posted a snap of him and 'true friend' Japanese leader Shinzo Abe posing in front of a giant tyre in Western Australia's Pilbara region . The pair were celebrating after signing agreements to boost trade and defence ties between Australia and Japan. Continuing their blossoming bromance on Wednesday, they stopped by Rio Tinto's 'Mine of the future' project - a joint Japanese-Australian venture - at West Angelas. They gleefully stood in front of the Komatsu 930E hauling truck tyre and Mr Abbott then posted the cheesy photo on Twitter. He wrote: 'PM Abe wearing his gift from Australia - RM Williams boots. Both proud to be wearing them today #RMs.' 'True friends': Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe on a tour of the Rio Tinto West Angelas iron ore mine in the Pilbara, West Australia . Stop the boots: Parodies of Mr Abbott striking the same pose on an asylum seeker boat sprang up online . Twitter users responded in disbelief. 'I have no idea what putting a leg up on that yellow bar achieves, it serves no useful purpose,' Marc Fearby wrote. Emma Belfield, responded: 'Good grief, Tone.' Rupert H joked Mr Abe said: 'Why is this strange awkward man making me do this.' And Peter Taggart tweeted US president Barack Obama, joking: 'This could be you at the G20 if you play your cards right.' Parodies of Mr Abbott striking the same pose in other situations also sprang up online. Poking fun at his highly criticised 'moral blackmail' comment about an asylum seekers' suicide attempt, one photo showed Mr Abbott attempting to sink a boat full of asylum seekers with his foot with the caption 'stop the boots!'. Sinking ship: Another parody showed the PM literally standing on top of a sinking boat with the caption 'awkward' Another showed the PM literally standing on top of a sinking boat with the caption 'awkward'. On Wednesday it was reported that a dozen mothers have tried to kill themselves on Christmas Island after deciding their children would have more chance of making it to Australia without them. Mr Abbott responded to the report on Channel Nine News saying: 'No Australian government should be subjected to the spectacle of people saying 'unless you accept us, I am going to commit self harm',' 'I don't believe any thinking Australian would want us to capitulate to moral blackmail. 'This is not going to be a government which has our policy driven by people who are attempting to hold us over a moral barrel – we won't be driven by that.' Boozing: Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe and Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott were pictured making a toast during an official dinner at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday . Mr Abbott also refused to say where a group of 153 asylum seekers were being held by Australian authorities, or whether they will be returned to Sri Lanka. Mr Abe's trip Down Under is the first bilateral visit by a Japanese leader to Australia in 12 years. And Japan and Australia are officially even better friends thanks to the vist, after the PMs swapped compliments at an official dinner in Perth on Wednesday. Mr Abbott said the partnership with Japan had deepened in extraordinary ways in the past few days. He said Mr Abe was his friend. 'But more importantly I can say with certainty and confidence that Japan is Australia's true friend and that Australia is Japan's true friend. We should never set limits on what we can achieve,' he said at the dinner. Done deal: Tony Abbott and Mr Abe signed agreements to boost trade and defence ties between Australia and Japan . Mr Abbott said he and Mr Abe had seen what had been achieved in their visit to the Pilbara. 'I look forward to Australia and Japan marching together into the future,' he said. Mr Abe said he was much impressed with the vast size of Australia and the five hours it took to fly from Canberra to Western Australia. 'I was able to discuss a lot of topics with Mr Abbott and so five hours I think even made both countries' relationship much closer,' he said. Mr Abe said Australia had Japan had lifted the relationship with the signing of agreements on economic partnership and defence co-operation. He said 57 years ago his grandfather visited Australia and signed the agreement of commerce. 'Since then both countries became true friends,' he said. 'I came away with the impression this time that the Australia people are very much convinced that Japan is a true friend.'","Tony Abbott and Shinzo Abe visited the Japanese-Australian mining venture in Pilbara, WA, on Wednesday .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The instant messaging war is well and truly upon us. Following major announcements from Facebook, Vine, Bebo and others, Snapchat has revealed its own ‘chat’ feature. Users within the popular image-sharing app can now message friends and make live video calls. Scroll down for video . Snapchat has unveiled its new messaging service that allows you to talk to other users. You can also now share live video with them (pictured) to make quick and instant calls . The update for the app is being released today on iOS and Android. The new feature, dubbed Chat, continues Snapchat’s theme of being quick, easy and simple. With just a swipe you’ll be able to privately message your friends. To use Chat, you simply load up the app as usual. When in your Snapchat inbox, you then swipe right on a friend’s name to send then a written message. The messages work like a regular Snap, and will be deleted after both of you have seen it and quit your respective chat screens. There is a button that lets you save important information, though, or of course you can always take a screenshot. If you and your friend happen to be chatting at the same time the app will alert you by saying they are ‘Here’ on the screen. Then, pressing and holding the screen will let you chat face to face instantly. Holding the top of the screen will show your friend the view out of the camera on the back of your phone. Touching the bottom of the screen will switch to the front camera, so you can show them a quick video selfie if you want. The latest update follows the previous change, which added Stories to Snapchat. This enabled users to have an image on their profile available for viewing for 24 hours. The chat feature, though, seems to be a clear rebuttal to moves from Snapchat’s rivals. Facebook, Vine, Bebo and possible even Twitter have all made moves in the instant messaging field in the past few months. Snapchat's move seems to be an attempt to ensure they hang onto their chunk of the lucrative photo and text communication market. At the end of 2013 it was estimated that Snapchat had over 26 million users in the US alone, with many others around the world. And in a survey of American college students in February, 77% said they used Snapchat on a daily basis. But the company still apparently holds only 5% of the 'selfie' market, with this move perhaps an attempt to keep them in the game. To use Snapchat's new Chat feature (pictured) you simply need to swipe right on one of your friend's names in the app's inbox. Messages are deleted when you both quit the chat window . You can activate the front (left) and rear (right) cameras on your device by dragging your finger to the bottom and top of your phone respectively . Back . in February Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for . $19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion to . buy Snapchat. At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . The greatest World Cups in memory have often been defined by one-man teams, players of such influence and inspiration they have dragged their nation through the tournament. Diego Maradona and the Argentina of 1986 is, of course, the most celebrated and emphatic of examples. But there have been countless others; Eusebio firing Portugal to the semi-finals of 1966, Johan Cruyff leading the Dutch to the final eight years later, Roberto Baggio doing likewise with Italy in 1994 and Zinedine Zidane twice the star of France’s passage to the final in 1998 – when they won on home soil – and in 2006 when they were beaten by Italy, the latter perhaps more impressive. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Middlesbrough legend Juninho give his thoughts on Neymar . Samba magic: Neymar has scored four goals at this World Cup to fire Brazil into the last 16 . Influence: Messi scored four of Argentina's six goals to help his side reach the knockout stages . Top of the world: Diego Maradona led Argentina to World Cup glory in Mexico in 1986 . Maradona, though, remains the most iconic player in World Cup history, the spellbinding nature of his one-man show ensuring such. In Brazil, however, there are a pair of contenders for his crown. For, like Maradona, compatriot Lionel Messi and host nation golden boy Neymar are shouldering the hopes of an entire population. And it appears they are more than capable of carrying such weighty expectation. It is shaping up to be the ultimate head-to-head. Already the Barcelona comrades reside at the summit of the scoring chart with four goals apiece; by this juncture in Mexico 28 years ago Maradona had just one. Their latest helpings were a pair of doubles; Messi's in the 3-2 win over Nigeria, Neymar in the 4-1 destruction of Cameroon. To illustrate their influence, minus Messi’s goals Argentina would be back in Buenos Aries today having exited with just two points, while Brazil – without the contribution of Neymar – would have only just scraped through to the latter stages in second place.

As it is, though, they both advance as group winners and so protect the possibility of a meeting in the Maracana on July 13. It – Brazil versus Argentina, Neymar versus Messi – is the final with which this most mesmerising of tournaments deserves to climax. We have all enjoyed the team ethic of the Chileans, the organisation and killer instinct of the Dutch, the flair of the French and the devastating dynamism of the Colombians. But there is something even more magical about one man overcoming the flaws and frailties of his team-mates to determine destiny. Such impact gives birth to legend. Such impact at a World Cup cements it for eternity. And, like Diego, their genius is effortless, aesthetically at least. For if the likes of Luiz Gustavo and Javier Mascherano are the water-carriers, then Messi and Neymar turn it to wine. Both players have laid quite fabulous foundations from which to build as we enter the knockout rounds, the environment in which tournaments and players are, ultimately, defined. Failure to negotiate the next hurdle – Switzerland for Argentina and Chile for Brazil – would render their early impact sadly academic, for no-one remembers a group-stage hero; Gabriel Batistuta scored four times for Argentina in the first round of France 98 but did not even make FIFA’s all-star squad. The stage, then, is set. Can either of the talismanic No.10s prove they are No.1? Maradona-like legend awaits if so.","The Barcelona team-mates lead the goalscoring charts with four strikes each .

"By . Richard Spillett . An electronic cigarette that exploded while charging in a car has prompted fresh safety fears over the product. Carer Kim Taylor, 54, left the device on charge for just ten minutes before she noticed flames and thick black smoke billowing from the vehicle. No one was inside at the time, but the back seat was completely melted and the mother-of-two was horrified at the thought she and her family could have been injured. Scroll down for video . Safety fear: Kim Taylor and her son Jake, 11, had to extinguish a fire in her car after an e-cigarette exploded . ‘I’ve gone to sleep with it plugged in . before,’ she said. ‘I hate to think what would have happened if it had . exploded next to me.’ The . battery-powered product is billed as a healthy alternative to real . cigarettes as users inhale nicotine with no tar, tobacco or carbon . monoxide. But there have . been several cases of the device exploding while on charge and it is . thought to have claimed its first victim in November last year. Fire . chiefs said the blaze that killed 68-year-old Evelyn Raywood was . started by an e-cigarette battery pack left charging at her care home in . Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Dangerous: Miss Taylor said the explosion and resulting fire filled the car with foul-smelling smoke . Miss . Taylor, from Leicester, had put her e-cigarette on charge in an . auxiliary socket in the back of her Ford Mondeo during a short drive. 'I’ve gone to sleep with it plugged in before. I hate to think what would have happened if it had exploded next to me' Kim Taylor . When she arrived home she left it there for a further ten minutes – and . it was only when she returned to the vehicle by chance that she realised . it was on fire. With her . son Jake, 11, she threw water on the blaze but the e-cigarette had . already ‘exploded into bits and melted into the carpet’. The e-cigarette and charger were made by Prestige Vaping but the car adapter plug was bought elsewhere. Concerns: Miss Taylor, a 54-year-old carer now fears for her family's safety when around the devices . Yasin . Patel, director of Prestige Vaping, said it had sold thousands of the . same starter pack Miss Taylor bought – and this was the first time a . problem had occurred. 'If the appropriate charger was used we would take further action' Yasin Patel, Prestige Vaping . He . said the firm sold car adapters that must be used with the device, as . stated in the user manual, adding: ‘If the appropriate charger was used . we would take further action.’ Miss Taylor, who also has a daughter aged 26, claims neither the e-cigarette nor charger came with a manual. Philip . Le Shirley, from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, . said: 'It is important not to leave e-cigarettes to charge unattended.' The latest incident comes just a week after fire crews investigating a fire in East London said they believe the blaze was started by an e-cigarette on charge. More than 20 firefighters tackled the fire in a ground floor flat in Barking and rescued a woman, who was taken to hospital with smoke inhalation and shock. Fire chiefs investigating the incident said they believe an e-cigarette could have overheated while it was plugged into a mains socket. London fire chiefs believe this e-cigarette charger may have been behind a blaze in Barking . Earlier this month, a pensioner was engulfed in flames on a ward at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester in another incident. It is believed 65-year-old Jean Booth used an e-cigarette while she was on oxygen in her hospital bed and was left badly burned. Just two weeks earlier, an e-cigarette exploded in a barmaid's face while it was being charged near the bar of a pub in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Barmaid Laura Baty was burned when her e-cigarette exploded while it was charging . Laura Baty, 18, managed to quickly turn away from the flames  - but was left with a burnt dress and a injured arm. Following the spate of incidents, fire investigator Charlie Pugsley said: 'People assume e-cigarettes are much safer than ordinary cigarettes, and in most cases they are. 'The danger is that people sometimes use incorrect chargers which runs the risk of over-charging, which can potentially have explosive results.'","Kim Taylor, 54, left the device plugged in on back seat of Ford Mondeo .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Meghan Keneally . Two videos taken by passengers aboard Southwest Airlines Flight 345 reveal panic in the cabin after the nose landing gear unexpectedly collapsed as the plane touched down at New York's LaGuardia Airport on Monday. Bryan Foster happened to be filming out the window of the Boeing 737-700 as it came in for a landing and the shock of the plane's nose hitting the runway knocked the camera out of his hand. When he regained his composure and pointed the lens out o the window again, he captured sparks flying from the wing-mounted engine as it dragged along the pavement. New Yorker Aidan Mack captured a similarly terrifying scene from her seat aboard the plane, filled with 144 passengers and six crews members. Her video shows some passengers beginning to panic after they were shaken by the hard jolt with no warning. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sparks can be seeing flying from the Boeing 737's jet engine as it drags along the tarmac of Runway Four at LaGuardia airport after crash-landing Monday . Panic: Some passengers suddenly stood up after the plane came to a halt and demanded to get off the plane. Most, though, remained calm . WABC-TV reports that Ms Mack's story is even more incredible because she is deaf. She struggled to understand what was happening and fought panic - because she was unable to hear any of the announcements in the cabin. 'For me, it was just frantically trying to figure out the situation by watching the body language and the expressions of my fellow passengers, but I was really quite unique in that situation and all alone,' she told the TV station through sign language. Ms Mack's video footage shows some panicked passengers stand and scream after the crash-landing. Most, though, remained calm. Mr Foster, a Louisana-native, told Pix11 that he had no warning of what was about to happen when the landing gear gave way. 'We’re just approaching, we’re just coming in for a landing. I’m just filming with my GoPro (camera), out the window. And then we hit. That was the impact. It knocked the camera out of my hand,' he said. 'So I had to gather myself. So now I’m looking around. I’m looking around the cabin now and wondering what’s going on. I put the camera back out the window, and as you can see the engine is sparking as we skidded across the tarmac.' Southwest Airlines passenger Bryan Foster never realized he would be filming an air disaster when he held up his GoPro camera out the window as Flight 345 landed . Rattled: The jarring crash of the jetliner's nose on the tarmac left passengers shaken - along with the cameras inside the cabin . Within seconds of the plane coming to a halt, one panicked passenger can be heard trying to get off the plane. 'Open the doors! Can we open the doors?' he shouts. Another passenger tells the man to calm down. Finally, a flight attendant addresses the passengers who have stood up on the public address system, saying 'Ladies and gentlemen, we are not there yet. You need to take your seats.' Ten people were injured on the flight - which originated from Nashville, Tennessee. Six were taken to the hospital, though their injuries were described as minor. Passengers stayed in the cabin for nearly an hour before they were evacuated on the plane's inflatable ramps. Another video, obtained by NBC New York, shows the plane crash-landing at New York's La Guardia Airport at around 5.45pm on Monday as it arrived from Nashville, Tennessee with 144 passengers and six crew members on board. Frightening: A Southwest flight crash-landed at New York's La Guardia airport Monday evening after the landing gear unexpectedly fell off the plane . Caught on tape: A grainy video of the plane skidding down the runway for 15 seconds was released Tuesday morning just as the airport fully reopened . 'There was a loud crash and the plane skidded for 10 or 15 seconds,' flyer Mary Anne Sperry said. 'The doors weren’t being opened and smoke was filling up the cabin,' she told The New York Post. Airline officials are still trying to determine what caused that landing gear to malfunction as they said there was no advance warning of a problem. 'The aircraft skidded down the runway on its nose and then veered off and came to rest in the grass area,' said Thomas Bosco, acting director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The airport was closed for more than an hour, delaying thousands of travelers. On board: Around 150 people were aboard the Boeing 737 when it skidded off the runway and came to a stop on its front landing gear, pictured . One passenger posted this picture on Instagram of passengers escaping the plane through the inflatable sliding ramps while emergency crews look on . Passengers ran to safety after evacuating the crippled jetliner on Monday evening . One runway reopened and was operating by 8pm, and the entire airport was fully reopened Tuesday morning. Stranded travelers at the busy New York airport posted photos of fire engines hosing down the nose of the plane. Officials say the landing gear came down, but then collapsed as the plane touched down. Mr Bosco said there was no indication there was a problem with the landing gear before the pilot touched down in spite of reports that the flight was initially delayed in Nashville because of a problem relating to the tires. 'From what we know, the aircraft landed on runway 4 and the landing gear collapsed, specifically the nose landing gear,' he said. Witnesses reported seeing sparks flying as the nose of the plane skidded to a stop on the runway. 'I heard some people gasp and scream. I looked over and saw sparks flying at the front of the plane,' Bobby Abtahi, a lawyer who was waiting for a different flight and watching out of the terminal, said of his view of the crash. Three injuries were reported aboard the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700 jetliner, which was bound from Nashville, Tennessee . No injuries: Southwest Airlines Flight 345 crash-landed at New York City's LaGuardia Airport on Monday evening. It was forced to slide on the tarmac after its front landing gear failed to deploy . The plane was carrying 143 passengers and five crew members. Three minor injuries have been reported . Passengers . were forced to stay in their seats and wait aboard the plane for more . than 45 minutes before they could be evacuated. Everyone . was evacuated safely within an hour of the landing - sliding down the . inflatable chutes that extended from the doorways. It . is unclear what caused the malfunction. The rear landing gear on the plane extended normally. Witnesses told CNN that an emergency crew did not appear to be standing by on LaGuardia's Runway Four when the plane crash-landed. The . apparent mechanical failure comes just more than two weeks after Asiana . Airlines Flight 214 crash landed at San Francisco International . Airport, killing three Chinese students and injuring dozens. Bobby Abtahi, a businessman from Dallas, Texas, tweeted photographs of the cripples plane from the American Airlines Admirals Club. 'Wow. Wheels just came off southwest flight at LGA,' he wrote. Dancer Simirin Player, who was aboard the plane, posted a photo of herself safely outside the jet on Instagram. 'Just crash landed in Laguardia airport in NYC!! Thanks be to God that nobody was hurt! Scariest thing ever!!!' she said.

"By . Jack Doyle . Sir Malcolm Rifkind, head of Britain's spy watchdog, has condemned claims by Edward Snowden's reporters . Claims by supporters of rogue agent Edward Snowden that Britain’s spy agencies were as sinister as their counterparts in Russia and China were condemned last night as ‘insidious’ and unforgivable. The comments by the head of Britain’s spy watchdog, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, will be seen as a direct attack on The Guardian newspaper. It published vast amounts of previously secret information stolen by Snowden, pictured, from his former employers at the CIA which revealed in detail the extent of secret surveillance in the UK. In a speech at Oxford University’s Wadham College, Sir Malcolm, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), said: ‘It is ironic that Mr Snowden, in the name of privacy and the rule of law, chose China and Russia from which to launch his attack on the United States. ‘Intelligence agencies exist in every state, both democratic and authoritarian, throughout the world. While they share certain things in common, we must never lose sight of the differences. ‘Intelligence agencies within authoritarian systems may wish to protect the public from terrorism and some types of serious crime. But their primary objective is the preservation of the regime they serve. ‘Unfortunately, the insidious use of language such as ‘mass surveillance’ and ‘Orwellian’ by many of Mr Snowden’s supporters to describe the actions of Western agencies blurs, unforgivably, the distinction between a system that uses the state to protect the people, and one that uses the state to protect itself against the people.’ Unlike spy agencies in authoritarian countries, Britain’s spies do not want to be ‘all seeing’ or ‘all hearing’, he said. Instead, they operate with ‘noble motivations’ and under ‘lawful authority’. His comments came ahead of the publication today of a report by the Home Affairs Select Committee calling for the ISC to be stripped of its monopoly of scrutiny of the three intelligence and security agencies. In what will be seen as a power grab, it called for wider scrutiny by Parliament and for direct elections to the committee by MPs in the House of Commons. The committee declared that the current governance arrangements were designed for the Cold War era of John Le Carre and had failed to keep up with the modern era. The report said current scrutiny was ‘ineffective’. Snowden, a former contractor with the US National Security Agency (NSA) and CIA stole tens of thousands of confidential and top secret files and leaked them to The Guardian and the Washington Post . With reference to Le Carre’s fictional Cold War spy George Smiley, Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: ‘The current system of oversight is designed to scrutinise the work of George Smiley not the 21st century reality of the security and intelligence services. ‘The agencies are at the cutting edge of sophistication and are owed an equally refined system of democratic scrutiny. ‘It is an embarrassing indictment of our system that some in the media felt compelled to publish leaked information to ensure that matters were heard in Parliament. ‘The Intelligence and Security Committee should be given a democratic mandate in the same way as other Select Committees. We will then be able to robustly defend our methods of scrutiny and better serve those who protect us, and the public.’ While accepting that scrutiny could be improved, Sir Malcolm defended his work and pointed to holes the arguments made by critics of the services. Editor of the Guardian , Alan Rusbridger. The comments by the head of Britain's spy watchdog, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, will be seen as a direct attack on The Guardian newspaper . He said: ‘Our agencies are not, and do not wish to be, ‘all-seeing’, nor ‘all-hearing’. Their capabilities have been designed to pursue their lawful, narrowly-defined objectives. ‘True public servants operate with noble motivations, lawful authority, and subject to rigorous oversight. These are the values that distinguish public servants from a public threat. That is how those who work for our intelligence agencies see themselves.’ Comparisons with the US were false, he added, because of different approaches to surveillance in the two countries. Britain has no database of its citizens’ telephone communications, he said, so cannot abolish it, as President Obama is proposing. He pointed out that when a terrorist atrocity occurs, the public asks why so little was known about who did it. By contrast in the wake of the Snowden revelations a ‘smaller but vocal minority’ has been asking why so much surveillance is needed. And he said the internet age and the use of new technology by terrorists meant more surveillance was needed and greater intrusion tolerated than when the enemy was foreign governments. He said: ‘Most people recognise that if actual or potential terrorists are to be apprehended, there is likely to be a considerably greater degree of intrusion into the privacy of the public by the security services than was required when our enemies were restricted to foreign governments. It was wrong to claim that intelligence agencies had some ‘sinister intent’. Earlier this year Mi5 director general Andrew Parker warned in a speech that revealing details about the work of GCHQ was a ‘gift to terrorists’, while Sir John Sawers, head of MI6, said terrorists were ‘rubbing their hands with glee’. Snowden, a former contractor with the US National Security Agency (NSA) and CIA stole tens of thousands of confidential and top secret files and leaked them to The Guardian and the Washington Post. He eventually sought refuge in Russia where he was granted asylum.","Comments made by head of Britain’s spy watchdog, Sir Malcolm Rifkind .

"By . Jack Doyle . Millions of people’s personal details may have been illegally sold to junk mail firms after a series of shocking leaks of the ‘private’ electoral register. The leak of data, which was blamed on a ‘software error’, could lead to families being deluged with a flood of unwanted cold calls, emails and letters badgering them to sign up for deals and agreements. Around 90 councils in England and Wales were affected by the problem - around one in four of the total. Millions of people's personal details may have been illegally sold to junk mail firms after a series of shocking leaks of the 'private' electoral register . Those affected are members of the public who have explicitly told their councils not to pass on their personal data, including their name and address, when signing the electoral roll. But their wishes were not passed on when the full register was transferred to credit reference agencies, who can sell it on to direct marketing firms. The national data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner, has launched an investigation and last night issued a plea to councils affected to come forward. Last night campaigners branded the scandal a ‘serious breach’ of individuals’ privacy. Emma Carr, acting director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘If people want to vote, we have little choice but to hand over detailed information about ourselves. ‘So for millions of voters’ details to have been wrongly been passed onto third parties, when they had explicitly stated that they did not want this to occur, represents a serious breach of councils’ responsibility to protect their information. ‘Councils have so far done little to reassure voters that this serious breach of their trust is being taken seriously.’ Town halls sell on the register for as little as £5 a time to private companies, to customers including pizza delivery shops, estate agents and direct marketing firms - adding to the avalanche of junk mail. Research published earlier this year showed more than 300 councils sold the register to 2,700 individuals and companies over the past five years. The councils involved made more than £250,000. Campaigners have called for the edited register to be abolished to stop the tide of junk mail. The latest scandal around the register emerged in recent days when three councils in Wales and Wokingham council in Berkshire admitted the ‘leak’ has affected a total of around 18,000 residents. The leak of data, which was blamed on a 'software error', could lead to families being deluged with a flood of unwanted cold calls, emails and letters badgering them to sign up for deals and agreements . It is unclear how the long the problem has existed but Wokingham council said yesterday it had been using the software for ten years. The councils affected in Wales are Rhondda Cynon Taf, Torfaen and Caerphilly. The Mail understands the company behind the software is Idox Plc, a software company based in Reading. Yesterday the company failed to respond to repeated requests for comment. Councils collect two versions of the electoral register. The full version is used for voting records and criminal investigations but its distribution is very limited. The edited register, which includes anyone who does not opt out, is available for sale to direct marketing firms. Wokingham council said the software which manages its list of voters had failed to work properly. It meant a large number of residents who had chosen to opt out of the edited register were not properly identified by the software when the list was passed on. The edited register can be sold on to marketing firms but the full version of the register should only be used for elections, preventing and detecting crime and checking applications for credit. Andrew Moulton, Wokingham council’s head of governance and improvement services, apologised to those affected. He added: ‘As soon as we were made aware of the matter we took swift action to remove names and addresses from the public domain. ‘For a short time their names and addresses were incorrectly included on the edited register which means they may have received material from direct marketing companies during this time. ‘We have since provided the correct information to the various agencies that sell on this type of information and we believe personal details have now been removed.’ ‘I’d like to reassure our residents that every step necessary will be taken to ensure this doesn’t happen again.’ A spokesman for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: ‘The full version of the electoral register should only be used for elections, preventing and detecting crime and checking applications for credit. Any suggestion that it has been made available for other purposes raises clear data protection concerns. ‘We are aware that a number of councils have reported that a software error has resulted in the full electoral register being made available more widely than it should have been. We are currently making enquiries into these potential data breaches.’","Around 90 councils in England and Wales were affected by the problem .

Mr Wallace has already been suspended indefinitely from his swimming team at the University of Florida where he is trained by US Olympic team coach Gregg Troy – but the consequences of his arrest could be much more far reaching. Mr Wallace, 21, said: ‘On the early morning of May 4, I made a poor decision in judgment. I understand that my accomplishments in swimming have the potential to be overshadowed by my behaviour outside of the pool.’ He added: ‘My actions have embarrassed my family, school, team, coaches, team-mates and myself. I am truly sorry to everyone affected by my mistake. I will use this negative experience to help me grow as a person and as a swimmer.’ According to the Gainesville Police Department report into the incident, Mr Wallace was spotted urinating on a police car in a street in the town. The report says that when a uniformed officer approached Mr Wallace he started running. The arresting officer continued: ‘I told the DEF [defendant] to stop, but the DEF refused to stop. The DEF was taken to the ground and continued to thrash his body on the ground refusing to be handcuffed. ‘The DEF was eventually placed in handcuffs.’ Punishment: Wallace has already been banned indefinitely from the University of Florida swim team . The officer added that, after he was read his rights, Mr Wallace stated that he ran because he was scared and that he had made a mistake. Mr Wallace, who is studying anthropology at the University of Florida, is due to represent his country in the 400m freestyle, the 200m and 400m individual medleys and the 4x200m freestyle at the Games later this year. He told the Mail on Friday that he had had contact with Team Scotland following the incident but he did not know yet whether it would affect his selection for Glasgow 2014. He said: ‘I’m sure over the next few days I’ll find out. Hopefully it won’t affect my swimming career on a long-term basis. I’m just trying to get through this day by day.’ After learning of his student’s arrest, coach Mr Troy, a renowned disciplinarian in the swimming community, said; ‘We are disappointed in some of the choices Dan Wallace made. ‘Because of his actions he will be suspended from team activities indefinitely. Any decisions regarding a change to his status will be addressed internally.’ Remorse: Wallace has expressed his regret over the incident while hoping he can pay back his parents' sacrifice . A spokesman from Team Scotland said no decision would be taken until all the information had been received and considered. Mr Wallace, who is in his second year training at the university, has previously paid tribute to the efforts his parents have made to allow him to pursue his sporting dreams in the US where he can be coached by the best in the business. He said: ‘My parents have sacrificed a lot. They work really hard to keep me in Florida and I work really hard to make them proud so it works out well.’ He added: ‘When I’m feeling tired, I just think how much they’ve put in and it’ s only fair I do the same.’","Swimmer Dan Wallace faces exclusion from the Commonwealth Games .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The mother of a murdered teenager has spoken of her agony after sick internet trolls posted abuse on a website dedicated to her daughter's memory. Charlotte Downes, 14, vanished in 2003 after being groomed by a child sex gang in Blackpool, and her body has never been found. Police believe that she was murdered, and it has been claimed her body was chopped up for kebab meat. Agony: Karen Downes, 48, (right) says sick internet trolls posted abuse on a website dedicated to the memory of her murdered daughter Charlene, 14 (left) The teenager's mother Karen, 48, has revealed how a page on an internet site dedicated to Charlene has been bombarded with sickening messages. They include claims that Mrs Downes and her husband Rob, 52, were partly responsible for their daughter’s death. 'There are a lot of evil people, saddos and weirdos on Facebook making up all kinds of filth,' said Mrs Downes. 'It is all hearsay and lies. I’ve had people threatening to come round to my house and beat me up. 'I informed the police. 'It is bad enough Charlene is not around without people making up this disgusting stuff. 'They won’t come and say it to your face, so they say it over the internet and I just want it to stop. Charlene will never be forgotten, but we need closure.' Mrs Downes said messages were left on the social networking site accusing her and her husband of allowing Charlene to be abused, claims they have always denied. It is the first time she has spoken out since cold-case detectives from Lancashire police re-opened the case in November, 10 years after Charlene disappeared. 'Hearsay and lies': The posts include claims that Mrs Downes and husband Rob, 52, (left) were partly responsible for their daughter¿s death . At the time she vanished, the teenager was believed to have been one of a group of girls being groomed for sex with cash, gifts and booze.Detectives said Charlene may have been abused by up to 100 men. In 2007, two Blackpool takeaway shop owners were charged with Charlene’s murder. Prosecutors claimed, based on secret recordings, that her body was chopped into bits and used for kebabs. However, the first jury failed to reach a verdict. A retrial was scrapped and the men cleared because witnesses and the police’s recorded evidence were 'unreliable'. 'It is bad enough Charlene is not around without people making up this disgusting stuff' Karen Downes . The defendants, business partners Iyad Albattikhi and Mohammed Reveshi, later received six-figure compensation payouts for false imprisonment. Mrs Downes had hoped to launch a civil prosecution against them, but said she could not afford to hire lawyers to help her. 'The cost of a solicitor will be about £6,000 to start with,' she said. 'I haven’t got that kind of money. I’m upset and devastated, but what can I say. I’ve just got to live with it.' She also hit out at the police, saying the family has had little support, a claim they have denied. 'Since the case collapsed in 2008, all the police have done is fobbed me off and gone through the same things over and over again,' said Mrs Downes. 'They said the case had been re-opened in November but then they said it has never been closed. 'It can’t be both. 'I’m so mad. I do not have any faith in the police at all. 'I just hope and pray the police help us but they just don’t seem to want to know.' A spokesman for Lancashire Police said cold-case detectives met the Downes family on February 18 and said a family liaison officer had been in contact as recently as last week. She said: 'We are not discussing any new lines of inquiry at this stage.'","Charlotte Downes, 14, vanished in 2003 and her body has never been found .

"By . Jack Doyle . and Laura Clark . Children aged ten should be given more school lessons about illegal drugs and dangerous new ‘legal highs’, a government adviser said yesterday. Professor Simon Gibbons, a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, said a broader drugs education was needed in  primary and middle schools. He said the committee should be ‘pushing for’ more information for ten, 11 and 12-year-olds. The PM's drug adviser, Professor Simon Gibbons of University College London, says that children should be educated about the dangers of 'legal highs' as early as primary school . The father-of two said his elder daughter, aged ten, was already ‘starting to be aware of some of these materials’. His comments will raise concerns among parents who do not want their children exposed to such advice or who would prefer to handle the issue at home. Mr Gibbons, a professor of Medicinal Phytochemistry at  University College London, is chairman of the council’s sub-committee on legal highs. He told a public meeting of the council yesterday: ‘As chairman, I would certainly like to see more done on the education done in primary settings. ‘We had a discussion last week and we want the Department for Education to be involved in this. ‘I always use this as a little girl test. I have two young daughters who are eight and ten and the elder one is certainly at that age when she is starting to be aware of some of these materials. Education minister Liz Truss said the DfE was taking ¿to ensure children are taught about the harmful effects of drugs¿ . 'At the primary/middle school phase there’s not enough information on drug education – that’s something we should be pushing for.’ Schools are required by law to cover the harmful effects of drugs on behaviour and health as part of the national science curriculum. A new national curriculum being introduced in September states that pupils in year six at primary school – those aged ten and 11 – must be taught to ‘recognise the impact of diet, exercise and drugs and lifestyle on the way their bodies function’. It states ‘pupils should learn how to keep their bodies healthy and how their bodies might be damaged – including how some drugs and other substances can be harmful to the human body’. They should also explore ‘the relationship between diet, exercise, drugs, lifestyle and health’. Although Personal, Social and Health Education lessons remain non-compulsory, the Department for Education recommends schools use them to expand the knowledge pupils get in science classes. Guidance endorsed by ministers says primary pupils should be taught ‘which, why and how commonly available substances and drugs (including alcohol and tobacco) could damage their immediate and future health and safety, that some are legal, some are restricted and some are illegal to own, use and supply to others’. Further guidance commissioned by ministers contains a series of standards for delivering drugs education in schools, including that ‘the situations, language and images are appropriate for pupils’ maturity, understanding and knowledge’. Education minister Liz Truss answered a Parliamentary written question last month on drugs education in schools. Asked by Tory MP Andrew Rosindell what steps the DfE was taking ‘to ensure children are taught about the harmful effects of drugs’, she said: ‘Pupils will learn about the effects of drugs on behaviour and health as part of the new science national curriculum from September 2014. Teachers can also cover the issue through PSHE lessons.’","Advisory Council on drugs misuse, say broader drugs education is needed .

"By . Jack Doyle . Senior Labour ministers are agitating against Ed Miliband in a game of ‘leadership Top Trumps’, the party’s policy chief has admitted. Jon Cruddas named Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, Mr Balls’s wife and Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, and health spokesman Andy Burnham as among those positioning themselves to replace him. His comments are the most explicit admission to date by a senior party figure that senior Shadow Cabinet figures may attempt to remove Mr Miliband in a bid to improve the party’s prospects. Bid for power? Jon Cruddas named Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, Mr Balls's wife and Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (pictured together) as among those positioning themselves to replace Mr Miliband . But Mr Cruddas, who is leading the party’s policy review, hit out at those who suggest that somebody else would perform better as leader than Mr Miliband. In an interview with the New Statesman magazine, he said: ‘This is a journey of self-discovery; it’s not a question of leadership. This won’t be resolved by throwing someone else in front of the train. ‘You ain’t going to do it by having a game of Top Trumps across the leadership. 'It’s not about Andy [Burnham], or Ed [Balls], or Yvette [Cooper]. If people think the solution to this is X rather than Y, they are deluding themselves.’ In the card game Top Trumps each card contains a list of numerical data, and the aim of the game is to compare these values to try to trump and win an opponent’s card. Mr Cruddas’s comments come amid catastrophic personal poll ratings and a series of humiliating PR blunders for Mr Miliband. Next in line? Health spokesman Andy Burnham, pictured right with Mr Miliband. Mr Cruddas's comments come amid catastrophic personal poll ratings and a series of humiliating PR blunders for Mr Miliband . Last weekend, Labour wheeled out former leader Neil Kinnock – who lost two general elections, in 1987 and 1992 – to defend him. At the same time, the most recent in a series of disastrous polls exposed the public’s lack of belief in Mr Miliband’s leadership. A YouGov poll found that 51 per cent think he is a weak leader, 56 per cent think he is out of touch with ordinary people and 60 per cent think he is not up to the job of leading the country. Criticism: Jon Cruddas, who is leading the party's policy review, hit out at those who suggest that somebody else would perform better as leader . In recent weeks, Mr Miliband was criticised after posing with a copy of The Sun, only to apologise for doing so when he was criticised by families of Hillsborough victims. Some on Merseyside still boycott the newspaper over its coverage of the tragedy. That followed a lacklustre performance in the European and local elections and a disastrous series of photos showing him struggling as he ate a bacon sandwich. Yesterday a Labour spokesman played down Mr Cruddas’s comments. ‘Jon was making the point that we are a united team, fighting hard to win the general election,’ the spokesman said. But Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Jon Cruddas has hit the nail on the head. ‘While weak Ed Miliband is getting knifed in the back by his colleagues and struggling to hold his divided party together, the Conservatives are putting in place our long term economic plan to secure Britain’s future.’ A Tory source added: ‘It says it all that Labour’s policy chief is describing their campaign as a slow-motion train crash.’ At the weekend Lord Kinnock criticised media attacks on Mr Miliband, but he added: ‘It won’t stop him; his genuine strengths of thought, action and toughness will get through and help to win victory.’ And Mr Burnham told BBC Radio 4 that pressure was only increasing on Mr Miliband ‘because he has put us in a position where we can win in ten months’ time’.","Jon Cruddas said Labour ministers may attempt to remove Mr Miliband .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . If England spent much of their pre-match World Cup obsessing about the centre forward they may or may not face in Sao Paulo on Thursday, all of a sudden there is another goalscorer looming on the horizon with something to prove. Luis Suarez and Uruguay were always expected to provide Roy Hodgson’s team with something of a test this summer. Providing Suarez proves his fitness, England will deal with that particular obstacle on Thursday. Around the corner, however, await Costa Rica and their young striker Joel Campbell. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Arsenal youngster Joel Campbell score a screamer . Rising star: Joel Campbell has caught the eye for Costa Rica . Sharp-shooter: Campbell was on target in the 3-1 win against Uruguay . Opening his account: Campbell helped Costa Rica cause a World Cup shock . A goal from the 20-year-old Arsenal forward helped Costa Rica shock Uruguay with a 3-1 win in Fortaleza on Saturday and those closest to him have predicted more of the same when the central American nation meet England in Belo Horizonte next week. Campbell’s father Humberto told Sportsmail: 'I expect and want to make it known that I have told him this has to be the game for him. 'When he played against Manchester United [for Olympiakos in the Champions League last season] I told him that it had to be the game to shine, to show the world what he can do. 'He has the football to show in England and this is the time for him to prove it to everybody. I have told him this and that is what he is going to do. What he did against Uruguay, it was incredible. 'I knew he was going to score or do something exceptional, like he did for the third goal. I expected that. I knew it would happen.' Campbell has been an Arsenal player for three years but has spent all of that time out on loan, first at Real Betis in Spain and then in Greece with Olympiakos. Having scored the second goal in Olympiakos’s defeat of United in Athens last season, the 20-year-old made a small dent on the public consciousness back in England. Making a name for himself: Campbell scored against Manchester United in the Champions League for Olympiacos last season . Learning curve: Campbell has progressed during his loan spell in Greece . His performance in Brazil at the weekend, though, left an even greater mark and it appears that the young footballer will not lack confidence against Italy in Recife on Friday or indeed against the country where he hopes to make his living next season. 'When he was young I used to work away a lot on cruise ships,' revealed Campbell senior. 'When I came back I brought videos of Pele and Maradona with me to show him. We sat on the bed and I showed him the videos of their best moments. 'When I showed him one piece of skill from Maradona, he said: ""Pop, where did he get that from? I invented that"". 'I told him that was impossible but he took me out on the porch and he showed me the trick. I knew then that I had a little Maradona on my hands. High praise: Campbell's dad has compared him to a young Diego Maradona . 'When he was smaller, I was always taking him up and down to football school. When he was five I took him to one school and the guy said he couldn’t take him as he was too young. So I told him he was seven and they put him in the team. He was actually only five and one of the smallest in the team but he was the best. All the time he was like that. Playing with older guys. 'I always thought when he was growing up that he would be a great player. I just tried to support him and give him all he needs. He is looking forward to going to the Premier League.' Campbell’s loan with Olympiakos is now up and he is due to report back to Arsenal for pre-season. His club . manager Arsene Wenger is in Brazil working for French TV and will be . aware of the impact his player could be about to have on the World Cup. Taking note: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is keeping a close eye on Campbell . 'Hopefully he can see what Joel can do,' said Campbell Snr. 'If they bring him back home to Arsenal I will be very happy. 'If they don’t then wherever they send him he just has to go and keep his feet on the ground. 'He has always been good enough. He just needs them to give him the chance. I always had it in mind that Arsene knows what is best for young ones. He always makes good players. 'Unfortunately he didn’t want to play Joel when he was 18 but maybe he will when he is 21.' Campbell Snr is travelling around Brazil with his wife Roxanne and believes the party that has already started in Costa Rica is about to get bigger. Certainly the Group D underdogs have a real chance of making progress now that they have three points from their first game. 'Everybody back at home is very excited,' he added. 'I said beforehand that we would beat Uruguay, draw with Italy and beat England. That is still what I feel. That is what I said. 'The win on Saturday didn’t surprise me. I told my son that. I am not sure he believed me. Danger: England need to be wary of Campbell . 'If we come out with the personality I know the team has then I know they can damage England. Sometimes if you think too much it can cause trouble. 'I know England are not better than us and if they are confident to just go and show what they can do they will beat England. 'My country is a small country – just a few million – and people pretty much ignore us. But if my son was Brazilian, for example, he would be famous around the world.'","Young striker scored in opening group game against Uruguay .

"By . Jill Reilly . Driving experts are warning women to abandon their fashionable Ugg boots and Hunter wellies when behind the wheel. Road safety organisation GEM Motoring Assist said many drivers - particularly women - were worried about keeping their feet warm during the current cold spell. However, GEM is urging drivers to keep a sensible pair of shoes for driving in the car. Driving advice: Driving experts are warning women to abandon their trendy Ugg boots, left, and Hunter wellies, right, when behind the wheel . The group said swapping Ugg-style sheepskin boots and wellingtons for appropriate shoes while driving could make a real difference when it comes to road safety. David Williams, head of GEM Motoring Assist, said: 'We know that fashion dictates which winter boots are popular this season, however, many of them don't offer enough grip and could cause your foot to slip off or in between the peddles when driving. 'This could cause a serious accident if control of your car is lost. All the difference: The type of footwear used while driving could make a real difference when it comes to road safety in bad weather (file photo) 'Always keep a sturdy pair of shoes in your vehicle for driving, ideally ones that can be fastened securely or laced up, and with a good grip on the sole. Correct footwear makes driving a lot less hazardous.' Wellington boots can also make it more difficult to control your feet and movement on the pedals, says GEM. Dangerous driving: Assistant headteacher Vera Baxter caused a head-on car crash after her Ugg boot became trapped under her brake pedal . The heavy duty rubber and thick shape of wellingtons allow less room for manoeuvre, making them one of the least practical options for driving this winter. Mr Williams said: 'Not only should drivers be comfortable when driving, they should also make sure their movement is not restricted or impaired. 'If your boots or shoes don't let you move freely, switch to a pair that allows you complete control over your driving, and your vehicle, at all times.' Last October a teacher wearing Ugg boots caused a head-on collision when one of her shoes became trapped under a brake pedal. Assistant headteacher Vera Baxter, 49, was unable to slow her VW Golf down because her footwear had become snagged on the pedal and she took evasive action to avoid hitting cars in front. However, she veered into the path of a Mercedes being driven by Jason Hoang, 33, in Manchester city centre. She had also caused a police patrol car to swerve out of her way just moments before hitting the car of Mr Hoang from Middlewich, Cheshire. Baxter was arrested and charged with dangerous driving after being treated for cracked ribs and internal bruising. Mr Hoang suffered from whiplash. After the crash, Baxter tore her boot away from the pedal and crawled free from the wreckage. She was banned from driving for four months and fined £350. She said: 'My Ugg boot got trapped at the traffic lights. 'I suppose it was a freak accident - as I put my boot across the prong of the pedal it caught in the seams.","Road safety organisation GEM Motoring Assist issued the footwear advice .
