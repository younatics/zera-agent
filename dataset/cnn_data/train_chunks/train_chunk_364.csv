"New York (CNN) -- A grand jury is expected to announce this week whether a New York City police officer will face criminal charges in the alleged chokehold death of a New York man, according to people familiar with the investigation. Eric Garner, a father of six, died after NYPD officers confronted him on Staten Island for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. A video of the July 17 encounter shows NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo grabbing the 350-pound man in a chokehold and pulling him onto a sidewalk. During his apprehension, Garner, 43, is heard repeatedly telling the officers that he could not breathe. The New York City Police Department prohibits the chokehold tactic. The New York City Medical Examiner's office later ruled Garner's death a homicide. The cause of death was ""compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police."" After the incident, Pantaleo was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun while the investigation was under way. More protests? The case, which sparked anti-police demonstrations across the city, was brought to a grand jury in September, according to Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan. On Monday, Staten Island officials met with New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton to discuss the impending decision and the borough's preparedness for reaction to it. An attorney for Pantaleo told CNN his client testified for approximately two hours on November 21 in front of the grand jury. ""He was gratified to tell his story, he was relieved,"" Stuart London told CNN Saturday. London believes his client was the last to testify in front of the grand jury, which may signal that the panel may be nearing a decision. ""He was anxious and anxiety-filled prior to that,"" London said. ""He is cautiously optimistic, and knows that his fate is in their hands now."" The medical examiner also listed acute and chronic bronchial asthma, obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors in Garner's death. After chokehold death, NYPD to train officers on proper use of force . Decision comes after Ferguson protests . If the decision is announced soon, it would come just a little over a week after a grand jury in St. Louis County decided not to indict Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting death of unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown. Bratton announced in September that all NYPD officers will undergo a three-day retraining period on the proper use of force when engaging a suspect. ""It was evident to me and Mayor (Bill) de Blasio... that there was a need for a fundamental shift in the culture of the department, from an overarching focus on police activity... to an emphasis on collaborative problem-solving with the community,"" Bratton said before the City Council's Committee for Public Safety. Previous legal issues . Two lawsuits have previously been filed against Pantaleo. The plaintiffs in both suits allege false arrest, unlawful imprisonment, civil rights violations and other charges. One suit from 2013 was dismissed in January 2014, while the second, from February 2014, remains open. Garner had a lengthy criminal history, including more than 30 arrests, and had been arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes in May, police said. CNN's Leigh Remizowski contributed to this report.","Eric Garner died in a confrontation with New York police July 17 .

"(CNN) -- New Zealand may have retained rugby's Sevens World Series in fine style, but Fiji's Samisoni Viriviri claimed the honor of being named the competition's leading player following the finale in England. The flying winger was in imperious form throughout the season, as his searing pace and clinical finishing combined to produce 52 tries -- 19 more than his closest rival Tim Mikkelson. New Zealander Mikkelson, who was player of the year in 2013, had been one of four players in contention this time, along with South Africa captain Kyle Brown and England skipper Tom Mitchell. ""I am very proud to win this award and be the first Fijian to be named Sevens Player of the Year,"" Viriviri told the HSBC Sevens World Series' official website after Sunday's awards ceremony. ""He has been the most lethal finisher this season and his all round game has been outstanding,"" added Fiji coach Ben Ryan. ""He's scored some incredible tries and defended superbly well - I think I can remember one time in this whole season when somebody went round him."" Despite Viriviri's individual brilliance, Fiji could only finish the season in third place, trailing second-placed South Africa and champions New Zealand. Securing the title for the fourth year in succession, the All Blacks wrapped up their 12th win in 15 series during the group stages of the season-ending event in London. They were defeated by host nation England in their final Pool A game at Twickenham but earlier victories over Argentina and Wales took the Kiwis to the knockout stages while simultaneously confirming them as champions. Gordon Tietjens' side thrashed South Africa in the quarterfinal, won a tight semifinal 12-10 against the Fijians before rallying from 21-0 down against Australia in the final to win 52-33. The dramatic turnaround ended Australia coach Michael O'Connor's dream of finishing with a title in his last match in charge of a Series event. ""I am going to miss the series. I'll be back though but I probably won't have the seat I have at the moment,"" O'Connor said afterwards. ""But I will miss the players, the teams we play against, the people, the staff at the International Rugby Board -- it is an amazing tournament and really a world class event."" Unlike his rivals for Player of the Year, Viriviri was also named in the Sevens Dream Team, which featured New Zealand duo D.J. Forbes and Scott Curry, Canada's John Moonlight and Phil Mack, as well as Cameron Clark of Australia and South African Justin Geduld. ""We have worked so hard as a team to get things right and it has paid off this year,"" Mack said on the World Series website. ""To be recognized for it is great. It is a special feeling, and as a team we have made huge strides and we will share this with them. ""'Mooner' brings everything, his leadership is awesome, and the team follow behind him. I am super happy."" Next season's series starts in October, with Australia hosting the opening round, prior to its climax in London in May 2015. With rugby sevens making its Olympic debut in two years' time, extra incentive will be added by the knowledge that the top four-ranked nations will qualify directly for the 2016 Games in Rio.","Fiji's Samisoni Viriviri named Player of the 2013-2014 Series .

"(CNN) -- If timing is key for musical maestros, Vanessa Mae found out the hard way on the Sochi slopes that the same is true of Winter Olympians. The multi-million selling violinist made her Olympic bow in the giant slalom Tuesday, finishing some 50.10 seconds behind winner Tina Maze of Slovenia -- although Mae can take heart from crossing the finishing line, unlike 22 other competitors. The Singapore-born Briton also made history, becoming Thailand's first ever female skier and only third representative at the Winter Olympics, representing her father's homeland under his surname Vanakorn. Her 67th-place finish -- last of all those who actually completed the event -- was not enough to dampen the spirits, though, of somebody more practiced in racing through scales than down the side of a Russian mountain. ""I expected to be last but at the end of the day the Olympics is a great opportunity,"" she told reporters. The 35-year-old, on a slushy course, came hesitantly out of the starting gate, eventually finishing 27 seconds back after her first run and at the rear of the 74 who made it to the bottom out of the 89-strong starting field. Her second run saw her clock a total time for the event of three minutes and 26.97 seconds -- 11.35 seconds behind her closest rival Xia Lina of China. ""I nearly crashed three times, but I made it down and that was the main thing,"" said Mae. ""Just the experience of being here is amazing. I was worried I was going to get lost [on the course], but I just about managed it."" Mae, ranked 2,253 in the world, left it late to book her place at the 2014 Winter Olympics -- only claiming the relevant qualifying marks in Slovenia in January. The violinist, however, is delighted to have proven to the world that she now has an extra string to her bow, especially considering that this time last year Sochi had not even been on her radar. ""I'm a last-minute kind of girl, I mean training for the Olympics with six months to go was a last-minute thing,"" added Mae. ""My main purpose of being here was to really have a good time and to improve my skiing in a very short amount of time."" Describing music as her ""lifelong passion,"" but skiing as her ""lifelong hobby,"" Mae made her solo debut with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London at the age of 10, three years later becoming the youngest soloist ever to record the Beethoven and Tchaikovsky violin concertos. She is now a household name in Britain and much of the rest of the world, with global sales in excess of 10 million. Her self-described ""techno-acoustic fusion"" is big in Slovenia for one, with Tuesday's giant slalom gold medallist Maze -- a part-time singer -- admitting to being a fan. ""We spoke after the first race,"" Maze said. ""I didn't know that it was her sitting next to me."" ""I respect a lot of what she does with music and she has a great personality,"" she said, before adding: ""I wouldn't trade my gold medal for 10 million records sold.""","Violinist Vanessa Mae finishes 67th in giant slalom .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Kamiar Alaei and his brother, Dr. Arash Alaei, have been called pioneers for their community-based approach to HIV and AIDS in Iran. Since opening a hometown clinic in 1999, the men have been raising awareness about HIV, dispelling myths about the virus and treating people who are shunned because of it. They have also reached out to their neighbors in Afghanistan and Tajikistan and worked with medical universities in Europe and the United States. But in 2008, the Alaeis were arrested by the Iranian government. According to Kamiar, they were charged with ""communication with an enemy government"" and for trying to ""overthrow the government."" Kamiar says the charges had no merit, but he and his brother were found guilty and thrown into Iran's notorious Evin prison. Kamiar served most of a three-year sentence and was released in October 2010. His brother is still behind bars. CNN's Asieh Namdar recently caught up with Kamiar to talk about his work, his prison sentence and his relentless campaign for his brother's freedom. Asieh Namdar: What it is like to be an HIV doctor in Iran today? Dr. Kamiar Alaei: I can't answer for every doctor. But for my brother and I, it was about helping people and making a contribution to the public. We wanted to do it regardless of the country's political situation or whether or not our efforts were recognized. In Iran, there's also a stigma (against people with HIV and the condition it causes, AIDS). We wanted to make sure patients are not isolated and are not discriminated (against). Namdar: How do you reduce the social and cultural taboos associated with it? Alaei: It is not easy. The ""a-ha"" moment for me came in 1997 when I met a 19-year-old patient from Azerbaijan seeking treatment in Iran. He was isolated in a small unit, and when I asked the nurses why he was isolated, they said, ""He has AIDS, he's scary."" For me, that was the turning point. I started to talk to my brother about how we can change perceptions. We set up our first clinic in my hometown of Kermanshah, where people knew and trusted us, and we had a lot of contacts. Our goal was to create a clinic where everyone can come. ... We didn't want our patients to get labeled by others for coming to ""an AIDS clinic,"" so we provided our services in a known reproductive and family planning center. Only we knew the reasons people came in. Namdar: How much freedom and support did you have from the government to be able to do what you wanted to do? Alaei: We had the support of the president of a medical university because in Iran, the system of public health care is part of the medical university system. We also had the support of his deputy, who was the commissioner of health for the province. That was a great start. We engaged not just the patients, but their families. We talked to them about how HIV can be transmitted, what was true and what was a myth. We involved the local policymakers, clergies and religious leaders. Once we gained people's trust, our cases increased from one to two a week to 60 to 80 per day in six months. Namdar: What about financial help? Alaei: In the beginning, we struggled. We ran the clinic mostly on contributions from the local community, the university and volunteers. But later on, we got funding from The Global Fund. They support the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Namdar: You've been called pioneers, and your work has been called revolutionary -- a model for the rest of the Middle East. Can you explain your approach? Alaei: Our approach was community-based. We wanted to inform, involve and engage different parts of community. We wanted to provide everything in just a one-stop shop of sorts: prevention, treatment and social support, all in one place. In the U.S. and Western countries, patients usually seek medical treatment in one place and counseling in another place. But in Iran, we only had one chance to make a difference. Because these patients come for the first time, it may be the only time they come. So you have a one-time opportunity to keep them motivated so they can continue their treatments. Namdar: How did the 2005 election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad change things for you? Alaei: When we began our work in AIDS in 1997, there was a positive atmosphere to implement our ideas. When the new administration came, there was less focus on HIV/AIDS and the high-risk groups. It didn't seem to be a priority. Namdar: Let's talk about your trip to Iran that landed you and your brother in jail. Why would they arrest two doctors who were doing so much good? Alaei: I still haven't figured that one out. We were doing a lot of work outside Iran. We started helping our neighbors, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. We also started to collaborate with universities in Europe and the United States. We got involved with Johns Hopkins, Yale, Harvard. I have to be clear. All our work was focused on health and science. It was never about politics. When we were arrested, I was shocked and I thought they must have the wrong people. Namdar: What were the charges? Alaei: For the first seven months, there were no formal charges. Later we were charged with ""communication with an enemy government"" and for trying to ""overthrow the government."" None of it was true. We had done nothing wrong. Namdar: How do you feel about the fact your brother is still in jail and you're out? Alaei: It's the worst feeling. I wish sometimes I was in prison and he was out. But if we were both in prison, we couldn't help each other. Now that I'm out, I can campaign to raise awareness about his case. We've been lucky and privileged to have so much support from the international community. We were recently honored by the Global Health Council with the prestigious (Jonathan Mann) Award for Global Health and Human Rights. I also got the opportunity to talk about my brother and his contributions at an international AIDS conference in Italy last month. Namdar: Do you think talking about your brother's case could hurt his case instead of helping it? Alaei: This is a very difficult question, and something I struggled with. It's one of the reasons I decided to say nothing for months after my release. My brother is halfway through serving his sentence, and we've heard nothing. So I feel I have a responsibility to raise awareness about his case. Namdar: What are your plans for the future? Do you want to go back to Iran? Alaei: My immediate concern is my brother. I wake up wondering what's he's doing and how he's holding up. My heart is with him. I try to focus on my work as a scientist and finishing my doctorate at the University at Albany. As far as going back to Iran, I have nightmares of being back in prison. It depends if I can be useful in helping HIV patients. Predicting government reactions in Iran is difficult. I would love to go, but at this time I would think that I cannot go. But it does not stop me working on this issue. Namdar: What is the biggest lesson you've learned from this process? Alaei: If you believe in what you are doing and love it, never give up, never get discouraged. Even in my darkest hours in solitary confinement, knowing we had helped so many patients gave me hope and the will to continue.","Two brothers have been globally recognized for changing how HIV, AIDS are treated in Iran .

"(CNN) -- One of rugby's global stars is returning to the public eye to help promote sevens ahead of the sport's Olympic debut at Rio 2016. New Zealand great Jonah Lomu, a veteran 63 caps for the All Blacks in the 15-a-side form of the game, will act as an ambassador for next month's HSBC Sevens Worldwide Series event in Wellington. The giant winger became a worldwide star after an electrifying series of performances on the wing for the All Blacks at the 1995 World Cup, but the second half of his career was blighted by serious kidney problems that required a transplant in 2004. ""He is a legend in the game of fifteens, and more importantly, he's a legend in the game of sevens,"" Sevens Wellington general manager Marty Donoghue said in a statement. ""He's also a legend in Wellington, so to be able to bring all of those things together and have him be a part of the tournament is incredibly special."" ""With the sport of sevens set to make an appearance at the 2016 Rio Olympics, we also look at this as an opportunity for Jonah to be an advocate for the next generation of sevens athletes."" Before becoming the youngest player to be selected for an All Blacks Test match in 1994, Lomu shot to prominence with his performances at that year's Hong Kong Sevens event. ""It is a privilege more than anything else to be part of this tournament,"" the 38-year-old said in a statement. ""I'm on board with anything that encourages homegrown rugby and showcases Wellington at its best. This is our nation's capital city, and in my eyes, this is the best tournament in the world."" Lomu eventually retired from professional rugby in 2007, having made a brief comeback following his transplant, and later made a handful of appearances for a French amateur team. He was scheduled to take part in a charity boxing event in 2011, but had to withdraw due to his continued kidney problems. Wellington is of special significance to Lomu after he spent three years playing for the regional Hurricanes team in the southern hemisphere's Super Rugby competition, while also representing the city in provincial competition. Despite his many triumphs, sevens success in Wellington evaded Lomu. ""As much as I was born an Aucklander, Wellington has always felt like home, so for me, this feels like I'm coming home,"" he explained. ""I've played all the tournaments, and the one tournament that slipped through my fingers, was this one. ""So every time the Kiwi boys win here in Wellington, I always feel proud. Even more than that, it's just amazing to watch how Kiwis get in behind the tournament itself."" Lomu is convinced that sevens can help attract new players to the sport of rugby. ""When you're looking towards the future and where things can really grow, sevens is your game,"" he added. ""With it now being an Olympic sport, there is no bigger stage, and being there will take it to another level.""","Jonah Lomu to serve as ambassador to Wellington Sevens event .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The next president will have to decide when and how to leave Iraq and what the United States will leave behind, Sen. John McCain said Friday. Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain trade jabs over each other's economic plans. Speaking at the first presidential debate, McCain said the war had been badly managed at the beginning but that the United States was now winning, thanks to a ""great general and a strategy that succeeded."" ""Sen. Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq,"" McCain said of his Democratic opponent. Sen. Barack Obama responded: ""That's not true, that's not true."" He blasted McCain as having been wrong about the war at the start, saying McCain had failed to anticipate the uprising against U.S. forces and violence between rival religious groups in the country. Before moving into foreign policy, the candidates focused on the economy. McCain said he would consider a spending freeze on everything but defense, veterans affairs and entitlement programs in order to cut back on government spending. Obama disagreed, saying, ""The problem is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. ""There are some programs that are very important that are currently underfunded,"" Obama said. He agreed that the government needs to cut spending in some areas, but he said other areas, such as early childhood education, need more funding. McCain repeated his call to veto every bill with earmarks. Obama said the country ""absolutely"" needs earmark reform but said, ""the fact is, eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we are going to get the middle class back on track."" McCain and Obama also tangled over who would cut taxes more.  Watch Obama talk about his economic plan » . McCain said he would lower business taxes in order to encourage job growth in the United States, while Obama said he would cut taxes for 95 percent of American families.   Watch McCain outline differences between him and Obama » . Obama also said that the United States was facing its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. McCain said he was encouraged that Republicans and Democrats were working together to solve the crisis. The first 30 minutes of the debate focused on the economy, even though the debate was supposed to be centered on foreign policy. The economy has dominated the campaign trail for the past two weeks. Obama refused to be pinned down on whether he would support a $700 billion plan proposed by President Bush's top economic advisers, saying the final details of the proposal were not yet known. McCain said he hoped to be able to vote for it. Just hours ago, the fate of the debate was in limbo because it was unclear whether McCain would show up. The Republican presidential candidate announced Wednesday that he was suspending his campaign to help forge legislation to save crippled U.S. financial markets. McCain said he would not attend the debate unless Congress reached an agreement on the bailout package. McCain said Friday that enough progress has been made for him to attend the debate, even though Congress has not made a deal. In the final hours before the debate, McCain and Obama separately checked out the stage at the debate site on the University of Mississippi campus. After their walk-throughs, the candidates went to separate locations for some last-minute debate prep. Outside the debate site, students and residents in Oxford said they were thrilled -- and relieved -- to find out that the debate was still on. The University of Mississippi said it invested $5.5 million in Friday night's event. McCain's campaign said the Arizona senator would return to Washington after the debate. Obama issued a statement saying he plans to return, also. Full coverage of the debates . There's a lot on the line for both sides. The election is just weeks away, and polls show Obama and McCain in a tight race. According to CNN's average of national polls, Obama holds a 5-point lead over McCain, 48 percent to 43 percent. The 9 percent of respondents who are undecided could swing the election either way. Both campaigns played the expectations game Friday afternoon. Going into debates, campaigns try to lower expectations for their candidates while raising expectations for their opponents. Read more about the expectations . Senior McCain adviser Mike Salter tried to play down the expectations surrounding his candidate, saying McCain wanted only to ""do well against a guy who is a pretty good debater, show presidential leadership and be able to speak directly to the American people about what he believes."" The Obama camp, on the other hand, tried to build up the debate as a must-win for the Arizona Republican, arguing that the debate's focus on national security and foreign affairs amounted to a ""home field advantage"" for McCain. ""If he slips up, makes a mistake or fails to deliver a game-changing performance, it will be a serious blow to his campaign. Given his unsteady performance this week, he desperately needs to win this debate in a big way in order to change the topic and get back to his home turf,"" Bill Burton, an Obama spokesman, said in a memo. Obama had contended all along that the debate should go on, saying the financial crisis made it even more important for the public to hear the candidate's views. The candidates' running mates are not be in Mississippi to watch the debates. Sen. Joe Biden, Obama's VP pick, is watching the debate from his hotel room in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Biden told firefighters and their families at a fish fry in Cudahy, Wisconsin, on Friday that the debate is a ""big deal"" because it will illustrate a fundamental national security difference between the candidates. ""The fundamental difference between John and Barack and me and John is this: If you're talking about security, it starts at home in addition to protecting our troops abroad and giving them everything they need."" McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is wastching the debate from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she is preparing for her debate with Biden on October 2 with a cadre of domestic and foreign policy advisers.","NEW: Barack Obama says John McCain wrong about Iraq .

"(CNN) -- A visibly angry Sen. Hillary Clinton lashed out Saturday at Sen. Barack Obama over campaign literature that she said he knows is ""blatantly false,"" while Obama called her outburst ""tactical."" Sen. Hillary Clinton waves campaign literature she says is false. Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland is behind her. Clinton jabbed the air with her hands as she told a crowd in Cincinnati, Ohio, that two Obama mailings spread lies about her positions on universal health care and the North American Free Trade Agreement. ""Shame on you, Barack Obama,"" she said. Polls show Clinton and Obama are in statistical dead heats in delegate-rich Ohio and Texas, which both hold votes March 4. With Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland nodding in agreement behind her, Clinton accused Obama of emulating the tactics of Karl Rove, President Bush's former political director who is reviled by Democrats. Obama ""is continuing to send false and discredited mailings with information that is not true to the voters of Ohio,"" Clinton said.  Watch Clinton demand a 'real campaign' » . One mailing says her health care proposal would force everyone to buy health insurance, regardless of ability to pay, a charge Clinton vehemently denied. ""Sen. Obama knows it is not true that my plan forces people to buy insurance even if they can't afford it,"" she said. The NAFTA mailer says Clinton was a ""champion"" for NAFTA while first lady, but now opposes it. NAFTA was negotiated by the first President Bush and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. ""I am fighting to change NAFTA,"" Hillary Clinton said Saturday. ""Enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics right out of Karl Rove's playbook. This is wrong, and every Democrat should be outraged,"" she said. Obama denied Clinton's assertions that the literature was false. ""There's nothing in that mailing that is inaccurate,"" he said, adding that he was puzzled by the sudden scrutiny since the mailers had been around for days, if not weeks. ""We have been subject to constant attack from the Clinton campaign, except for when we were down 20 points. And that was true in Iowa. It was true in South Carolina. It was true in Wisconsin, and it is true now,"" Obama said. He described Clinton's anger as ""tactical"" and defended his campaign. ""The notion that somehow we're engaging in nefarious tactics I think is pretty hard to swallow.""  Watch Obama respond » . Clinton challenged Obama to ""meet me in Ohio, and let's have a debate about your tactics and your behavior in this campaign."" The two are scheduled to meet for a debate next week in Cleveland, Ohio. Obama spokesman Bill Burton said his campaign looked forward ""to having a debate this Tuesday on the facts, and the facts are that Sen. Clinton was a supporter of NAFTA and the China permanent trade treaties until this campaign began. "" ""And she herself has said that under the Clinton health care plan, she would consider 'going after the wages' of Americans who don't purchase health insurance, whether they can afford it or not,"" he added. Saturday was not the first time the Clinton campaign has criticized mailings from the Obama campaign. In late January, leading up to Super Tuesday contests on February 5, the Clinton camp said Obama mailings distributed in Connecticut took Clinton's statement about her Iraq war vote out of context. The Obama flier said the New York senator had admitted voting in favor of the war even though she had not read an intelligence report that cast doubt on claims that Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction. The Clinton campaign called the mailer misleading, saying only ""a handful of senators"" had read the report itself -- and that most, like Clinton, had instead opted for a briefing by the report's authors. Obama has accused both Clinton and her husband of engaging in unfair attacks. Obama, who has rolled to 11 straight wins since Super Tuesday, leads Clinton by 140 pledged delegates, according to CNN estimates, going into the Texas and Ohio primaries. Vermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on that day. E-mail to a friend .","NEW: Obama says notion that he is engaging in nefarious tactics is ""hard to swallow""

"(CNN) -- By day, he dons a white lab coat. At the weekend, he terrorizes opposition teams in his bright red outfit. Even Humphrey Kayange struggles to define himself. On his Twitter biography, he asks: ""Rugby player/research officer or is it the other way around?"" In one walk of life, he is trying to help rid the world of disease as he works on new antibiotics at a British university. In another, he is one of the stars of the rugby sevens circuit, despite coming from a country best known for producing long-distance runners. For all his prowess both on and off the field, his nickname perhaps lacks imagination -- ""Tall"" -- although at 6 foot 6 inches it must be said he lives up to the billing. While he has bedeviled opposition defenses on the HSBC IRB Sevens circuit, it is his less heralded work behind closed doors at Bristol University that is of the greater consequence. Broadly, his studies come under the banner of chemistry and math, but more specifically it is a research project on antibiotics. ""It's a massive project at the university,"" Kayange explains. ""We're all trying to foresee antibiotics and developing resistance, so we're looking into developing new drugs. ""It's more to do with bacterial infections and it's a very slow and steady process."" The 31-year-old says the research is funded by British pharmaceutical multinational GlaxoSmithKline, which trials the compounds and active ingredients that the chemists provide. ""There's been some positive results but it's a long process,"" he says. ""The potential to do good things for human beings is amazing. It's an interesting project to be a part of."" It may not seem likely on the surface but his rugby and chemistry are intertwined, even though most sevens specialists don't have quite the same academic achievements on their CVs. It was while training at Bristol University with the Kenyan national team three years ago that he was spotted by rugby officials at the training facility. They were interested in his rugby skills as well as his chemistry qualities. So he applied for a place, was accepted and moved to the southwest city in February 2012. He struggled initially to adapt to rugby life in a wintery England, being used to warmer climes on the sevens circuit. ""One weekend I was playing in the sunshine of Las Vegas or in a New Zealand winter, and next it was a mud bath in Bristol. England in February was a shock but I got used to it and love it."" His time in the city is coming to a close, with his thesis on examining tablets that are fed to fight bacteria drawing to its conclusion. It is something he has juggled alongside his rugby commitments but later this year the sevens will once again become the major focus as he builds towards the 2014 Commonwealth Games and, bigger yet, sevens' debut at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Rugby was not an obvious sporting choice for Kayange, who grew up in Eldoret in the Rift Valley, a region renowned for producing Kenya's greatest long-distance runners. Many top athletes, such as double Olympic and world champion Mo Farah, go there to train each winter. ""Growing up there, all you saw were long-distance runners, a lot of them,"" he says. ""Because of our history, everyone expects sportsmen from Kenya to be runners."" The long runs were never Kayange's forte. A sprinter in his youth, unlike most of his peers, he wanted to run fast but only over short distances. The other sporting passion was football, played out in often dust-bowl conditions on the dry pitches of the East African nation. Rugby was a mere afterthought. ""I think I was 16 or 17 when I first played at high school,"" he recalls. ""I wasn't interested -- I'd never really seen anyone play -- it was just a sport I had to try. I braced myself for it at first but, once I got used to the physicality of it, everything else was fine. ""It was so confusing with the rules when I first started. I really remember in my first game just concentrating on throwing the ball backwards. But I think I had a good first game as I just wanted to run."" He has kept on running to good effect ever since, scoring more than 130 tries in the international format for his country and starring in a series of victories against some of the true powerhouses of the sport. In fact, his family has produced three rugby stars -- Kayange's brothers Collins Injera and Michael Agevi also play for Kenya. Injera is his country's top try scorer and is third on the IRB Sevens' all-time list with 183 ahead of the next leg in Scotland next month. The Kenyans arguably first made a global name for themselves with their on and off-field theatrics -- they often perform a dance after competitions -- which earned them the tag of ""everyone's second favorite team."" ""I think we're quite different as a team, we love our running rugby, it's quite instinctive and everyone tends to love it,"" Kayange says. ""We've also come a long way in the sport and have been getting some good results."" The next step is for greater consistency in their results against the top teams, plus to have Commonwealth and Olympic aspirations. A proposal has been lodged to host a leg of the HSBC Sevens World Series but it has not been helped by ongoing security fears in Nairobi following last year's terrorist attack on the capital's Westgate shopping mall, when 72 people were killed. At the time, Kayange was playing with his compatriots and visiting teams from abroad on the other side of the city in the Safari Sevens. ""It was almost the end of the day when we first heard news of what was happening,"" he recalls. ""By the time we got back to our hotel, we only then properly heard the news. We've just been running up and down a rugby field and something this terrible had been happening. ""Thankfully, I didn't have any close friends or family in there. I knew of one guy who was there hiding in the basement. He was stuck in there for 12 hours but got out okay. Can you imagine going through that?"" The impact on the country was immediate. Tourism is undoubtedly down and, in terms of rugby spectators, it dropped from 20,000 for the first day to a mere 2,000 -- throwing doubt over a potential place on the sevens calendar. ""I can understand that as teams going to another place need to feel safe, that is No.1,"" Kayange says. With rugby and chemistry, Kayange -- who was named an IRB Sevens anti-doping ambassador in 2010 -- has set his sights on making the world a safer place. His work in science will go on, whether that's in the UK or Kenya when his research project ends. As for his rugby playing, he has set his sights on the Rio Games after which, if fit and selected, he looks set to end his remarkable sevens journey.

"(CNN) -- It needed permission from the British monarch and has the potential to enrage traditionalists, but one of horse racing's most regal occasions has crossed the rubicon and will allow sponsorship branding for the first time in its 300-year history. Like Augusta for golf's U.S. Masters and Wimbledon in tennis, Royal Ascot has thrived with barely a nod in the direction of the commercial world -- until now. The most quintessentially English of all sporting events has signed a five-year partnership deal with a company controlled by the Qatari royal family. Do not expect to see massive advertising hoardings bearing the name of QIPCO, shorthand for Qatar Investment & Projects Development Holding Company. But on the first day of the event, which takes place in June, the name will appear in places such as the top of stalls and at the back of the parade ring. ""It will be limited branding in Royal Ascot colors,"" Charles Barnett, chief executive of the race course, told CNN. Barnett said Acot was actively seeking ""appropriate partners"" for the other four days of the meeting but was quick to stress there were some traditions that were not for sale. ""This most certainly does not extend to the names of races or the name of the event, which will be forever Royal Ascot,"" he said. As part of the deal, QIPCO has also agreed to sponsor the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes, a race for leading middle-distance specialists, usually classic winners, held at Ascot in late July. ""The time is right for us to maximize the commercial value of our properties,"" Ascot head of communications Nick Smith told CNN. Competitive era . Smith also revealed that a major driving factor was the need to attract the best thoroughbreds to Royal Ascot and its other premier meetings. ""It's a competitive market and we want to make sure our prize money is competitive,"" he added. But while there are clearly sound commercial reasons for the branding deal with QIPCO, would not such a major development need the permission of Queen Elizabeth, an avid racing enthusiast? ""Anything as important as this we would discuss with Buckingham Palace,"" said Barnett. ""Ascot was set up by an act of parliament (Enclosure Act of 1813) and we will be reinvesting everything we can into the business in the form of better facilities as well as better prize money."" QIPCO and Qatar's involvement in elite flat racing in Britain and Europe is a relatively new development, dating back to 2011. Their sponsorship of the British Champions Series, culminating in Champions Day at Ascot in October, broke new ground, with both the Champions Stakes and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes now carrying seven-figure prize money. Nick Attenborough, spokesman for Great British Racing which runs the series, welcomed the latest investments at Ascot. ""It's a real signal to the sport globally that they are here to stay,"" he told CNN. Previous Middle Eastern involvement in the flat racing scene was centered around the Godolphin operation of the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Now the new kids on the block are certainly making an impression, additionally sponsoring English classic races, the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket. Frankel connection . QIPCO also lent its name to the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, famously won twice by the unbeaten super horse Frankel. At Europe's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris, Qatari branding is emblazoned over the race course at Longchamps and last year's winner Treve is Qatari-owned. Qatar is also flexing its financial muscle in other sports, notably football, which will see the 2022 World Cup staged in the small Arab state of just over two million people. Qatari investors also own French champions Paris Saint-Germain. But aside from the controversy about playing conditions in the heat of the Gulf summer, there has also been criticism of its treatment of migrant workers employed to build the stadia and infrastructure for the competition. FIFA president Sepp Blatter said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and has met the Emir of Qatar to seek changes. Ascot chief Barnett would not comment on these specific issues, but added: ""We are dealing with an individual investment company -- a private company -- not the Qatari government."" Attenborough added: ""There are no labor issues in horse racing."" Unique event . The queen's views on these matters, as ever, will remain a closely guarded secret, but it is her patronage of Royal Ascot which ensures it remains a unique event in the sporting calendar. Last year, her filly Estimate won the Ascot Gold Cup, the first victory for a reigning monarch since the famous race began over 200 years ago. She was presented with the trophy by her son Prince Andrew in front of a hoarding on which there was a sign advertising the QIPCO Champions Series -- of which the Gold Cup was one of the key races. A sign, then, of the times to come, and this year the reminders of a more commercial age will be a little more obvious in the most traditional of settings.","Qatari company QIPCO to have sponsorship rights at Royal Ascot .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The founder of one of America's largest pizza chains has offered unexpected advice to his customers to limit themselves to only one or two slices. Pizza is not normally known for its health benefits; thick, cheesy toppings push up the calorie count. During an interview on BBC's Radio Four program in the United Kingdom, John Schnatter, said, ""you can't eat five or six slices."" He was responding to a question from presenter Adam Shaw about whether he was concerned about the impact of the British government's anti-obesity drive on pizza sales. ""No. Pizza's actually healthy for you if you don't eat too much of it,"" Schnatter replied, adding, ""You can't eat five or six slices but if you eat one or two slices it's very nutritious."" The pizza chain boss had just finished telling BBC listeners that the UK market was a ""huge priority for Papa John's International."" The company has 118 outlets in the United Kingdom, its second biggest market outside the U.S. after China. Sales in the UK jumped 60% on Monday alone after heavy snowfalls were estimated to have encouraged around one in five workers to stay at home. Schnatter is in the United Kingdom for the annual franchisee conference, a marketing tool to encourage more small business owners to buy into the Papa John's brand. While it's impossible to know whether his comments have dissuaded anyone from investing in the company, BBC presenter Shaw suggested shareholders might take issue with his suggestion. ""I'm not sure your investors would want to hear you tell people don't eat too much of our pizzas,"" he laughed before thanking Schnatter for his time. Schnatter opened his first shop in 1985, after selling his beloved Camaro to buy his first pizza oven. There are now more than 3000 restaurants worldwide.","Pizza chain founder advises customers not to eat more than one or two slices .

"(CNN) -- The temptation to eat a lot during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting, is great, but Saiful Khandker makes a conscious effort to not overdo it. It is traditional to eat dates on Eid al Fitr, the breaking of the month-long fast of Ramadan. ""You just kind of have to be mindful of, OK, if I weren't fasting and starving, what kind of meal would I have? And then kind of limit yourself based on that,"" said Khandker, technology systems director for a hedge fund in New York. Around the world, many observant Muslims like Khandker who've been fasting all day during Ramadan are thinking about the feast they'll have on Eid al Fitr, the holiday that ends the holy month, next weekend. Khandker describes this day as the Muslim equivalent of Christmas, complete with gift exchanges for children and a lot of food -- everyone can ""pig out for the whole day."" Food experts agree that the fast, during which observant Muslims refrain from eating during the day, can actually cause people to overeat. Some people actually take in more calories in one evening meal than they normally would over the course of a normal day during Ramadan, said Joe Regenstein, professor of food science at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. ""Ironically, there are table manner rules in Islam, and they actually normally encourage you to leave the table partly hungry, which is consistent with modern health guidelines,"" he said. This is one of many quirks about religious dietary practices. While no specific regimen of the major religions is better or worse than any other, it is important to keep certain health issues in mind when following those rituals, experts say. ""My general take is that you can have good diets and bad diets in any of the religious systems,"" Regenstein said. Here is a sampling of dietary practices carried out in major religions today, and what you should know about them: . Fasting . Religious eating habits are especially relevant this month with Muslims observing Ramadan and Jews about to undertake an approximately 24-hour fast on Yom Kippur, which begins at sundown on September 27. Overeating can harm the body and cause heartburn, cautioned Keri Gans, a registered dietitian in private practice in New York. If you are fasting, you should eat normal sized, well-balanced meals with plenty of liquids to avoid dehydration before a day without eating, she said. Some people should generally not undertake fasts for health reasons, including pregnant or breastfeeding women and small children, Gans said. If you have an underlying condition such as diabetes, you should talk to your physician about whether you should fast. As a part of a religion, fasting teaches discipline, Regenstein said. ""The discipline, at least in principle, should help a person eat better,"" he said. Meat laws . Kosher meat in Judaism is slaughtered in a specific way by a religious butcher known as a ""shochet."" The animal is drained of blood and broiled or heavily salted to help remove the blood. Both Judaism and Islam, whose dietary laws fall under ""halal,"" mandate that the animal be ritually slaughtered with specific prayers. The practice salting of meat helps fight bacteria, but probably not more than other modern antimicrobial techniques, Regenstein said. ""We're talking about 4,000 years of salting having benefit, and the rest of the science, in a sense, has caught up in the last 10 years,"" he said. If sodium is a concern because of high blood pressure, there are butcher shops that sell meat with different kinds of salt, or unsalted meat for broiling. The Jewish custom of separating milk and meat -- not eating the two at the same meal and, for the most strict adherents, having separate plates and utensils for each -- does not appear to have dietary advantages or disadvantages, experts say. In a practical sense, this tradition forces people to make their meals more diverse and plan them out more carefully, Regenstein said. Usually, people will not eat as much meat overall when they practice this kosher separation, he said. Hold the ham, shellfish . Judaism and Islam share a restriction against eating pork. Some say this helps stave off trichinosis, a parasitic disease that humans can get from eating undercooked or raw pork, Regenstein said. However, there is some question about whether pigs in the Middle East would have had trichinosis ages ago when these traditions were developed, he said. In addition, Jews traditionally do not eat shellfish, such as shrimp. Again, there is some association with certain diseases, as well as pollution, but it's not clear that this tradition leads to better health. Moreover, one of the staples of Jewish ritual meals such as Passover is gefilte fish, made from carp, which eats shrimp anyway, he said. Attitudes to alcohol . The Muslim prohibition of alcohol is not necessarily good or bad, Gans said. There is some research to suggest that alcohol in moderation improves good cholesterol, but it is not definitive, she said. Red wine is associated with positive effects such as cancer prevention, but grape juice may offer the same benefits, Regenstein said. Moreover, avoiding alcohol also skirts the negative social implications associated with the substance. In Judaism, however, wine is woven into ceremonies such as those for Passover and the Sabbath service. In fact, some synagogues give small portions of wine to children. Vegetarianism . People who practice religions such as Buddhism are vegetarians to varying degrees, with some members electing to cut out dairy and eggs in addition to animals and fish. Some Hindus are also vegetarian, and generally consider cows to be sacred. As long as vegetarians get an adequate supply of vitamins and protein, this can be a healthy lifestyle, Gans said. Some do need an extra boost iron or other nutrient, however, and should meet with a dietitian to figure out what's best for them individually, Gans said. A matter of taste? This is just a smattering of traditions practiced by various groups today, and subgroups of the religions mentioned here may have specific additional restrictions on certain animals. In the end, many religious dietary practices do not have any more impact on healthy eating than other habits that arise from personal preference, Gans said. Some people avoid shellfish because they simply do not like the taste, and do not get a determinant or benefit as a result. But, said Regenstein, kosher and halal are not fundamentally sets of health laws. Though he follows kosher rules himself, as a teenager in a Jewish community in Newark, New Jersey, he was suspicious of the common wisdom that the milk and meat separation was healthier ""because you don't mix the bacteria."" ""When I got more formally involved, it was actually sort of nice to realize that in fact these are not health laws. They are in the official category of 'God said, you do,' and I don't have to go back and try to chase this down.""","If you are going to fast, have normal sized, well-balanced meals .
The practice of salting kosher meat does kill bacteria, but so do other techniques .
Judaism and Islam share a restriction against eating pork .
Some say avoiding pork helps stave off trichinosis, a parasitic disease ."
"Do you want to keep your vision clear as the years go by? Put fish, olive oil, and nuts on the menu, but stay away from trans fats, according to new research from Australia. Age-related macular degeneration occurs when blood vessels or cells in the center of the retina break down. Studies from two different teams published Monday in the Archives of Ophthalmology provide more evidence that these foods -- which contain healthy fats -- can reduce the risk of developing a retina-destroying condition known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The studies aren't the first to suggest fish and omega-3 fatty acids may help protect vision; in fact, the first findings pointing in this direction are more than a decade old. But experts not involved in the research agree that the new studies are well done and rigorous. ""The studies are notable for that alone,"" says John Paul SanGiovanni, a staff scientist with the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who published 12 years of follow-up data on omega-3 fatty acids and AMD risk earlier this year with very similar results. ""It's sort of consoling to see that we have this convergence of findings coming from different continents,"" he says, noting that researchers from Iceland and the Netherlands have turned up pretty much the same thing. Health.com: Eat right advice: Fiber, starch, fats, serving sizes . AMD is the top cause of blindness among people 65 and older living in the developed world. It occurs when blood vessels or cells in the macula, the central portion of the retina responsible for central vision and seeing sharp detail, begin to break down. In early AMD, people have no vision loss or other symptoms, but do have yellow deposits in the retina called drusen. Some people with early AMD (but not all of them) will develop late AMD, in which a person has larger drusen and a blurred area at the center of their visual field. Right now, the only confirmed risk factors for the condition are age, genes, and smoking, so scientists are hoping to identify things that people can do to reduce their risk for the condition. And it's looking more and more like eating the right kinds of fats is one of them. In a group of 2,454 men and women followed for up to a decade, Dr. Jennifer S. L. Tan and colleagues from the University of Sydney found people who ate a serving of fish every week were 31 percent less likely to develop early AMD than those who did not. A couple of servings of nuts each week reduced risk by 35 percent. And Elaine W. T. Chong, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Melbourne and colleagues, in their study of more than 6,700 58- to 69-year-olds, found those who consumed the most omega-3 fatty acids were at 15 percent lower risk of early-stage AMD. People who ate the most olive oil (at least 100 milliliters, or about seven tablespoons, per week) were about half as likely to develop late AMD as those who consumed less than 1 mL per week. Health.com: Can olive oil fix your split ends? Dr. Chong and her team also found people who ate the most trans fat were 1.76 times more likely to develop late AMD during the study's follow-up period. Trans fat, a type of fat often found in commercial baked goods and fried foods, is known to boost LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol. Health.com: Everyday diet strategies to lower LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol . It makes sense that omega-3s would be helpful in saving your eyesight, says Elizabeth Johnson, Ph.D., a research scientist at the Carotenoids and Health Laboratory in the Jean Mayer USDA Health and Nutrition Research Center at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. Nervous tissue and the retinas contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, especially one known as DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, a particularly beneficial omega-3), she says. According to SanGiovanni, healthy fats likely guard against AMD by fighting inflammation. To date, all studies of dietary fat and AMD have been observational, meaning researchers have looked at what people eat and checked their vision over time. SanGiovanni is running a clinical trial -- AREDS 2, in which people have been assigned to take omega-3 fatty acids (and/or two pigments found in the retina called lutein and zeaxanthin) or a placebo -- the gold standard for determining cause and effect. He says he's hesitant to make nutritional recommendations until the results are published, which he expects will happen about four years from now. But Johnson points out that the nutritional recommendations revealed by the current study -- including eating a healthy balance of omega-6 fatty acids in relation to omega-3s -- can easily be accomplished by following the USDA ""My Pyramid"" diet guidelines.Health.com: Myths and facts about cholesterol . ""I recommend to my patients that they consume a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and fish, especially salmon, sardines and mackerel, as well as nuts and green, leafy vegetables,"" says Johanna Seddon, M.D., of the New England Eye Center and Tufts University School of Medicine. ""Those not able to consume these foods should consider taking supplements containing fish oil or lutein."" Seddon and her colleagues first reported findings linking omega-3 fatty acids and fish intake to lower AMD risk in 1994. Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"(CNN) -- The South Sudanese government and rebels signed a ceasefire deal last Thursday after more than a month of fighting that forced more than 600,000 people from their homes. But both sides have reported violations of the ceasefire, and it remains unclear if the truce will hold. The country erupted into violence on December 15 when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup. Violence quickly spread, with reports of mass killings emerging nationwide. The conflict has been a huge blow for South Sudan, a far cry from the country President Salva Kiir declared in early December to be ""open for business."" The world's youngest nation remains under construction and as it tries to maintain a fragile peace it will also need to reassure investors and get its economy back on track. These are a few of the pivotal economic issues likely to affect South Sudan's trade and investment in the future. Oil industry . South Sudan is the world's most oil-dependent nation, according to the World Bank, accounting for almost all of the country's exports and 80% of GDP. The Chinese government has invested heavily in the South Sudanese oil industry and in 2012, China pledged $8 billion in development loans for hydroelectricity and infrastructure projects following Kiir's visit to Beijing. Figures from the International Monetary Fund reflect South Sudan's rapid rise. Last year, the country, with an estimated population of 10.3 million, experienced astonishing growth of 24.7%. Before the conflict the economy was projected to grow 43% in 2014. However, much of South Sudan's new-found wealth is yet to filter down to its people and after 20 years of civil war much of the population remains impoverished and half living below the poverty line, surviving in a subsistence economy. Trade with neighbors Uganda and Kenya . South Sudan has four major trading partners in the East African community -- Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Following a 2005 peace deal in Sudan between the country's government and the separatist movement in the south, trade began to increase between Southern Sudan -- then a region -- and neighboring Uganda. Today, South Sudan is Uganda's biggest export market with cement, vehicles, iron and steel making up the bulk of trade while in 2010 and 2011, coffee generated revenues of $51.1 million, according to the African Development Bank. The country has also applied to join the East African Community, a regional economic body, which encourages free trade between its members. John Small, chief executive of the Eastern African Association, an organization that represents foreign investors in the region, said that other countries were beginning to look to South Sudan as a strong trading partner. He said: ""It's a growing market for Kenyan goods. Pretty much everything you get there is imported from or through Kenya"" including tobacco and tea. LAPSSET Corridor . The LAPSSET project, first conceived in 1975 could help solve South Sudan's oil transportation problems, which are steeped in its hostile relations with Sudan. LAPSSET -- or Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor -- is part of Kenya's Vision 2030 plan and will include a network of roads, railway lines, oil refineries and pipelines running between South Sudan and Kenya's Lamu Port, on the Indian Ocean. South Sudan took 75% of Sudanese oil when it gained independence in 2011, but much of the infrastructure needed to transport the oil for export remains under the control of the government in Khartoum. This has stifled production and sparked disputes over revenues. Small said regional cooperation, particularly with Sudan, is still the ""single biggest challenge"" South Sudan faces in exploiting its oil reserves. ""A pipeline takes a lot of time and money,"" he said, ""but with an agreement with Sudan, at least that gives you revenues, which you can then borrow against to build another pipeline."" The LAPSSET links would open up a vital artery for landlocked South Sudan to export its oil to the coast and offer a viable alternative to the current terminal at Port Sudan. Mustafa Biong, director general of information for the government of South Sudan, believes it will take ""up to five years"" before the country can export through Uganda and Kenya. Kiir's government is also planning to construct 4,000 kilometers of new roads throughout the country and 248 kilometers of rail lines to connect the most remote areas, including Juba, with Ugandan and Kenyan networks. Inflows of foreign investment . Foreign investors have flocked to the country in recent years, attracted by its vast untapped resources including oil and minerals. In South Sudan's investment report, the government states that it is aiming to diversify the nation's economy away from oil as much as possible by investing in financial services, agriculture and fisheries. Biong said any investors deterred by the violence will not stay away for long. ""Investors will come back,"" he said, ""they have made commitments here and they can see they can see the potential."" But South Sudan will have its work cut out regaining their trust and reassuring them that the country is a secure place to do business.

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student news starts right now! First Up: Dow 10,000 . AZUZ: We begin on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended yesterday above 10,000. So what? Well, for one, the Dow is made up of thirty of the biggest stocks, and a lot of people use it as a guide of how the overall market is doing. Secondly, this is the first time the Dow has gone over 10,000 in more than a year. That could mean that investors think the U.S. economy is recovering from last year's crisis. But some experts are warning things could still take a step backward. Health Care Hurdles . AZUZ: Health care reform. Yesterday, we outlined the next steps for Congress. But what about just ordinary folks? Some people are concerned that if health care reform gets passed, it might include some things they don't agree with. Tom Foreman breaks down some of the biggest questions in this debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: At this moment, as you watch at home, the president and other politicians here in D.C. are also watching you, because they really don't know what you want or what you will support. And their jobs down the road depend on figuring that out. It's also safe to say they're highly sensitive to the three questions you care about most. The first we've heard in virtually every one of those town hall meetings: What about my insurance, the care I have now? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm leaving. FOREMAN: Even though most Americans want reform, almost 80 percent told the CBS/New York Times pollster they are pleased with their own health care. And many fear reform could force them to change. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why would we have to change if we're completely satisfied with what we have? FOREMAN: The president says no, you won't be forced, but the opposition has whipped that worry into a frenzy. TELEVISION AD: For seniors, this will mean long waits for care, cuts to MRIs, CAT scans and other vital tests. Seniors may lose their own doctors. FOREMAN: Here's the second question. What about big government getting even bigger? Again, a very hot issue in all those town halls. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This government is out of control! We are in debt up to our eyeballs and you all are doing nothing but putting more debt on us and our children. And it's got to stop! FOREMAN: USA Today/Gallup found more than half the voters think big government is a bigger threat to the future than big labor unions or big business. The bailouts, the soaring deficit all driving that concern. And finally, what if this measure passes but fails to produce the results that people expect or want? Health insurance for everyone was the president's goal, but even if the plan approved by the Senate committee passes, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 25 million people will still be uninsured in 10 years. And the rest of us? Well, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found 70 percent of you think reform will make your care no better, might make it even worse. Fair or not, these are real challenges that you have raised for supporters of this measure. (END VIDEO CLIP) Is this Legit? RICK VINCENT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The United States is the largest country in the world. Nope! When it comes to total area, Russia is the largest country. The U.S. comes in third. Missile Diplomacy . AZUZ: Representatives from both the U.S. and Russia met in Moscow this week as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sat down with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. One of the biggest issues on the agenda: missile defense. The U.S. recently said it was dropping plans to build a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic; Russia had wanted the U.S. to drop those plans. During a radio interview, Secretary Clinton suggested that the U.S. and Russia could and should work together on missile defense. U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: It is imperative for countries like Russia, the United States and China to lead against the forces of disintegration and destruction, so that we can stand united against those who would undermine the opportunities that we are seeking to promote. Afghan Troop Levels . AZUZ: The number of troops in Afghanistan is increasing. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced Wednesday that 500 additional forces will be heading to the country. That will bring the total number of UK troops serving in Afghanistan to 9,500. Meanwhile, President Obama held the latest in a series of meetings with military, foreign policy and national security advisers yesterday. They're all reviewing the U.S. strategy in the Afghan conflict and how it should move forward. One big point under consideration is Gen. Stanley McChrystal's request for an additional 40,000 U.S. troops. Runaway Teen . AZUZ: And remember Rifqa Bary? She's the 17 year old who ran away from Ohio to Florida after she accused her father of threatening her when she converted from Islam to Christianity. Well, her father had denied that accusation, and a law enforcement report found no evidence of any criminal activity. The case ended up in court, where a judge ordered Bary, who you see here, and her parents to sit down and try to work out a solution. Now, the judge says it's in Rifqa's best interest for that process to take place in Ohio. So, once her immigration status is clarified, that's where she's heading. Bary's parents are happy about the ruling. They had asked for their daughter's custody to be transferred back to Ohio. Her attorney was against the move. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Costa's government class at Burlingame High School in Burlingame, California! What Cabinet position does Hilda Solis hold? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Secretary of Agriculture, B) Secretary of Energy, C) Secretary of Labor or D) Secretary of Transportation? You've got three seconds -- GO! Hilda Solis became labor secretary earlier this year. Before that, she served eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Hispanic Heritage Month . AZUZ: We're recognizing Sec. Solis as we wrap up our celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month. She is the first Latina labor secretary and says it's ""a dream"" to be serving in that role. Solis has more than two decades of public service. In that time, she's put together a few firsts. You can see some right here. Sec. Solis says one of her most important accomplishments was becoming the first person in her family to graduate from college. And that came after a counselor once told Solis' mother that her daughter wasn't college material. In a recent interview with CNN's Brianna Keilar, Sec. Solis said more families need to understand the significance of getting a higher education. HILDA SOLIS, SECRETARY OF LABOR: It is important for that to kind of be a lesson for other people, to know that it is possible to have changes like that coming, maybe even influences from outside sources like a high school counselor who happened to take an interest in what I was doing and thought I was capable of going to college. AZUZ: During the interview, Solis said she wants to use her work with the Labor Department to improve the quality of life for everyone. SOLIS: I want to inform people about opportunities that the Department of Labor can offer them. And I want to do that in a way that will impact the Hispanic community and other communities that are in great need right now. Fiesta Latina . AZUZ: Meanwhile, the White House hosted a fiesta this week. Fiesta Latina featured artists with roots in Latin America. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEO) U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we are honored to be joined by some of this country's most successful and innovative performers of Latin music. Although Latin music takes many forms, this spirit of diversity also unifies us. Latin music speaks to us in a language we can all understand, about hope and joy, sorrow and pain, friendship and love. It moves us, and it tends to make us move a little bit ourselves. (END VIDEO) Latino in America . AZUZ: How are Latinos remaking America, and how is America remaking them? That's the focus of the new CNN documentary ""Latino in America."" It airs next Wednesday and Thursday at 9 p.m. Eastern. And make sure to check out our related teacher materials. You'll find that at CNNStudentNews.com. Before We Go .

Hurricane Rick - Keep an eye on a major hurricane swirling in the eastern Pacific Ocean. World's Tallest Building - Marvel at the magnitude of what will be the tallest building in the world. Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi. Hope you had a great weekend. We're ready to get started with a new week of commercial-free CNN Student News. From the CNN Center, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Pakistan Offensive . AZUZ: A peace deal with the Taliban? Not an option. Those are the words of a Pakistani military official as the country launches this massive operation against the militant group. This is not the first time Pakistan has tried this kind of large assault, but that same official says this is the most important because it's aimed at what he says is the Taliban's main area of power in Pakistan. Reza Sayah has more on the assault and its impact. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REZA SAYAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT, ISLAMABAD: Showdown in Pakistan: 28,000 troops move into South Waziristan to take on the Taliban on their turf. Soldiers now locking horns with Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud and up to 15,000 of the region's most hardened Taliban and al Qaeda fighters. PERVEZ HOODBHOY, PAKISTAN DEFENSE ANALYST: At this point, I don't believe that the Pakistani state has a choice. SAYAH: Defense analyst Pervez Hoodbhoy and military officials call South Waziristan ""the headquarters of the Taliban and al Qaeda,"" a safe haven where they are free to train and plan deadly suicide and guerilla attacks. HOODBHOY: Waziristan is very important in the assertion of Pakistan's sovereignty. Furthermore, this is where the Taliban have their nerve centers. SAUYH: Hoodbhoy says the Taliban know the severe and unforgiving terrain here well and will use it to their advantage. The much anticipated ground offense follows a recent wave of militant attacks in Pakistan that killed more than 150 security personnel and civilians. In several brazen assaults, armed militants humiliated security forces by penetrating the most sensitive police and military compounds. HOODBHOY: What we have seen is that suicide bombings have spread into all our cities. We have seen the extremists become stronger and stronger day after day. And that nerve center lies in Waziristan. We have to go for it now. SAYAH: With troops moving in, tens of thousands of local residents are packing up and moving out. For weeks, they have seen Pakistani jet fighters bomb militant hideouts in preparation for the ground offensive. The U.N. says 80,000 people have already registered for relief aid. UNIDENTIFIED MALE [TRANSLATED]: There's war, and we have to take care of our children. That is why we left the area. SAYAH: Washington will watch the battle closely. The Obama administration says insurgent attacks in Afghanistan are often planned and launched from South Waziristan. They've long pressured Pakistan to get tough on militants here. Three times the Pakistani army has launched military offensives in South Waziristan. All three times, they failed. The Pakistani army now with a fourth opportunity, one it can ill afford to lose. (END VIDEO CLIP) Troops in Iraq . AZUZ: Okay, we're heading to Iraq now, which is where 3,500 U.S. troops won't be going. They were scheduled to deploy to the Middle Eastern nation in January and to replace a National Guard unit that's serving there right now. But the military says the troops aren't going to Iraq and the National Guard unit is still on schedule to return home. It's all part of the U.S. plan to gradually decrease the number of American forces in Iraq. U.S. combat troops are scheduled to be out of the country by next August. And all American forces are expected to leave Iraq by the end of 2011. That schedule is based on the ability of Iraq's security forces to take control of the country. But it could be affected by ongoing violence. The latest example: Four Iraqi soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb over the weekend. However, Chris Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, says the plan for American forces is still on track. CHRIS HILL, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ: As for our schedule of troop withdrawal, we've been pretty clear about when the troops would be withdrawn. We've been working very hard with Iraqi security forces. So, our plan is to draw down the troops as we've said we're gonna do. Hurricane Rick . AZUZ: And the National Weather Service says people in southwest Mexico and Baja, California -- which is actually part of Mexico -- should keep an eye on Hurricane Rick. Yesterday, this storm reached category five status with top winds around 180 miles per hour. That made Rick the second strongest hurricane in the eastern Pacific Ocean in more than 10 years. Sunday morning, the storm was about 500 miles south of Cabo san Lucas, Mexico. Forecasters expect it to move north and get closer to the Baja Peninsula later this week, although they do predict it's going to lose strength between now and then. Promo .

Is it in: A) Saudi Arabia, B) Yemen, C) Bahrain or D) United Arab Emirates? You've got three seconds -- GO! Dubai is one of the seven states that make up the United Arab Emirates. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! World's Tallest Building . AZUZ: The Sears Tower. Taipei 101. The Petronas Towers. All of these are some of the tallest buildings in the world. But there's a new one in Dubai has em 'all beat. Imagine running a half mile. Now imagine going that distance straight up. Stan Grant looks at the company and the country that are behind a towering accomplishment. (BEGIN VIDEO) NEIL ARMSTRONG, NASA ASTRONAUT: That's one small step for man... STAN GRANT, CNN CORRESPONDENT, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: The year, 1969. Now, 40 years later, here on Earth in a city in the Middle East, man is again reaching for the stars. KYE HO KIM, SR. VICE PRESIDENT, SAMSUNG CONSTRUCTION: This is kind of a project like the first exploration to the moon, ok? Nobody can challenge it. GRANT: The Burj Dubai translates in English as Dubai Tower, and it certainly towers over what is already a massive Dubai skyline. Kye Ho Kim is senior vice president with Samsung Construction, a division of the giant, Korean multi-national company that is rewriting construction records with this building. KIM: It's really very scary. GRANT: Why? You can see down? KIM: Yeah! Just the bottom, we can see right through the bottom. GRANT: Oh my goodness! The whole way to the ground? KIM: Oh, yeah! GRANT: What a list of firsts: When completed and opened, it will be the tallest building in the world at more than 800 meters; that's about half a mile high. It will be the building with the greatest number of floors, the world's highest and fastest elevator. When finished later this year, after five years of construction, the cost will top out at more than $4 billion. And on it goes. KIM: They have 1,200 units of residences and hotel rooms. Think about just one building, one single building. We have one town. GRANT: It's a source of pride for a company whose success is a symbol of Korea's development. A country once devastated by war and still divided between North and South, it has rebuilt itself, emerging as a modern capitalist democracy and launching global companies just like Samsung. KIM: I think Korean engineers are very diligent, I think the most diligent people in the world. GRANT: You're very proud! KIM: I'm very proud. GRANT: Proud of this building, proud of Korea? KIM: Yeah, yeah. GRANT: Well, Dubai is all about firsts; it's all about what is the biggest and what is the most impressive. I'm just leaving Dubai Mall now; that is the biggest shopping mall in the world. And if you walk down here and take a look behind me, here is the biggest building in the world, or it will be when it's open. Now, if you speak to the people who are constructing it, this is not just a building, it is a symbol: a symbol of Korea and what Korea's been able to achieve and indeed, a symbol for all humanity. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ:  That thing is huge. Now, before we go, one of life's hugest mysteries: Who let the dogs out? Apparently everyone, based on this pooch parade in Ohio. The canine costumes included cops, so naturally, you had some crooks, as well. Dressing a bulldog up as a bull seems like the natural choice. Although this jester doesn't seem too amused. Some pups wore top hats and tail while others played it cool. And this little guy is just bee-yond cute. Goodbye . AZUZ: Dressed up dogs, always a pup-ular choice for a Before We Go segment.

"(CNN) -- After gaining the royal seal of approval from the Duchess of Cambridge last month, Ben Ainslie's bid to bring the America's Cup to Britain for the first time in the competition's history has secured another important boost. The British government announced Tuesday that it would provide £7.5million ($12.8 million) of funding towards supporting the Ben Ainslie Racing team (BAR) and their new state-of-the-art base in the city of Portsmouth on the UK's south coast. The news was widely expected after reports hinted as much in the British press over the weekend and follows on from Portsmouth City Council's decision to give planning approval for the site of the new base. A British team has never won the 163-year-old competition despite hosting the first ever America's Cup on its shores in 1851. Ainslie, the most successful Olympic sailor of all time and winner of the America's Cup in 2013 with Oracle Team USA, now hopes to change all that with his own organization when the prestigious event is next held in 2017. Speaking alongside British prime minister David Cameron, Ainslie said he wanted to create a new sailing institution and legacy for the UK. ""We hope through our journey to bring the cup home to Britain we will inspire more young people to get involved in the sport, along with supporting the growth of the marine sector in the Solent area,"" he said. Cameron, meanwhile, focused on the potential economic benefits the project could bring to Portsmouth. ""(This project) will not only build on Portsmouth's global reputation as a center of marine and maritime excellence but will also deliver a real sporting and economic boost to the UK,"" he said. According to promotional material from BAR, the new headquarters will employ around 90 people directly. The base will become the focal point for the design, construction and development of the team's boats and will also provide sports science and fitness facilities. Making the venture financially sustainable and attractive to potential investors will be vital if BAR want to compete with Oracle, which is funded by U.S. billionaire Larry Ellison. Speaking to CNN last month, Ainslie said that BAR wouldn't be working with ""Ellison's budget, so we have to be very focused with the money we have."" However, he added: ""We've never won it. We have a huge maritime history. We have to bring this thing home."" Construction work on the new base will start immediately, with planned completion in May 2015, the team said.","Ben Ainslie Racing receives $12.8 million funding boost from British government .

Reporting from the CNN Center in Atlanta, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Health Care . AZUZ: 14 for, 9 against. That's how the votes stacked up yesterday when the Senate Finance Committee voted on a health care proposal, and that was enough for the proposal to pass. Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Democrat who helped write the bill -- called the Baucus Bill -- he called it a balanced plan. But the committee's top Republican says he's concerned about the direction that the bill might take health care in America. Now one thing we want to point out, this vote is just part of the process. Jessica Yellin looks at how we reached this point and where the debate is going from here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: There have been at least 60 hearings, more than $124 million of TV ads, one presidential address, and an unknowable number of status updates. Finally, it's game day. Off the blocks, Chairman Baucus was feeling strong. YELLIN: It's going to pass today? SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT), FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Yep, yep, yep. Big day. YELLIN: But all eyes were on Senator Olympia Snowe, the one Republican who might vote yes. Would she? SEN. OLYMPIA SNOWE, (R) MAINE: Let's say I'm sorting through all the issues. YELLIN: All this attention, all this interest. BAUCUS: The meeting will come to order. YELLIN: This must be the final decision on health care reform, right? Wrong. This is just the vote of one Senate committee. Next, their bill has to be stitched together with another bill passed by a different Senate committee, and that new health care bill will go to a full vote of the U.S. Senate. So, you think that's it, one more vote and health care reform is done? Oh no. Over here at the House of Representatives, they are working on their own health care bill that would be paid for differently and include some type of public option. If that passes, then you have two health care bills, one from the House and one from the Senate. Here's the home stretch. Those two bills have to be merged before the full Congress can make the big vote on health care reform. Simple, right? So, why is everyone taking this vote so seriously? It's serious because this committee has been the biggest roadblock to passing health care reform. And Republican Olympia Snowe announced she's voting yes. SNOWE: They want us to continue working. YELLIN: At least for now, the White House can claim a smidge of bipartisan support, and health care inches forward to the next step. (END VIDEO CLIP) I.D. Me . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm an Asian country that's a little smaller than the state of Texas. On an alphabetical list of the world's countries, I come first! Most of my terrain is made up of rugged mountains. And in 1996, the Taliban took control of my capital city of Kabul. I'm Afghanistan, where the Taliban was removed from power in 2001 by the U.S.-led military forces. Why 40,000? AZUZ: There are 68,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan right now helping to fight the Taliban. The group that used to control the country has regained strength in recent years. A top American commander said 40,000 additional forces are needed to win that fight. That's a recommendation that many lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, are urging President Obama to follow. How did the commander come up with that number though? 40,000, what's that all about? Chris Lawrence has the answer. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: One hundred thousand American and allied troops are already fighting in Afghanistan. To understand why it's believed General Stanley McChrystal wants 40,000 more, you need to look at a map the way military strategists see it. KIMBERLY KAGAN, ADVISER TO GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: What 40,000 does is fill in the gaps around Kandahar, around Khost, in Helmand Province. It does not, however, cover the entire country. LAWRENCE: Kimberly Kagan is an adviser to McChrystal. She says it's the minimum number to root out the Taliban and identify and protect potential Afghan partners. But the military's own counter-insurgency ratio dictates it would take well over half a million troops to secure Afghanistan's 33 million people. But General McChrystal is not applying this ratio to all of Afghanistan. He feels certain parts of the country are peaceful enough, like the north, or just not as important, like the west, that they don't need the same number of counter-insurgency fighters as these areas do. KAGAN: And that's what gets him from a figure of hundreds of thousands of troops down to a figure such as 40,000 or 60,000 troops. LAWRENCE: Kagan says McChrystal would use those troops to turn the tide, so the Taliban doesn't control every other town. She says 10,000 or even 20,000 troops just aren't enough. KAGAN: It's not as though we can simply plug half as many holes with half as many troops and somehow seize the initiative from the enemy. On the contrary, half as many troops will probably leave us pinned down as we are. LAWRENCE: The problem is roughly 25 million Afghans live in thousands of small, rural villages scattered all over an area the size of Texas. Up to 80 percent of the population could still be out of reach for coalition troops. So, when 30,000 American troops surged into Baghdad, that's where one out of every four Iraqis lived. Even if you take the top 30 most populated areas of Afghanistan, you'd still only account for 20 percent of the population. That's how rural and spread out it is. Chris Lawrence, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO) Severe Weather . AZUZ: Severe weather causing problems even when you think it wouldn't. Rain in an area that just struggled through fire. That might sound like a good thing, but experts are afraid it could make the situation even worse in parts of California. You remember the wildfires we told you about recently. Well, there is a storm that forecasters are calling the first major one of the season and it is pounding the state with strong winds and heavy rains. Officials are concerned that when those rains hit the land that's already been scorched by the wildfires, it could trigger dangerous floods and landslides. A few states to the north, you see where that road ends? That's not intentional. It's the result of a landslide in Washington state. One resident said the whole face of the mountain just came off. It wasn't caused by an earthquake. It wasn't severe weather. It's what scientists refer to as a ""natural land movement,"" one that caused an estimated $20 million in damages. CNN Heroes . AZUZ: Delivering meals to the hungry. Offering music education to keep kids off the streets. Providing prosthetic limbs to young people in need.

Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: What's in a name? We're to find out the answer for one couple in today's edition of CNN Student News. From the CNN Center in Atlanta, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Pakistan . AZUZ: Pakistan. The country is a partner with the U.S. in the War on Terror. It's also dealing with terrorist attacks inside its own borders. That point made clear in yet another violent assault yesterday. Government officials say an explosion in the country's Swat Valley, that's in the northern part of Pakistan, killed at least 40 people and wounded at least 45 more. The blast took place at a security checkpoint. Authorities say the target was a military vehicle. Taliban forces took control of the Swat Valley earlier this year, leading to a number of intense clashes with the Pakistani military. Monday's attack was the latest in a string of violence in the country, including a 22-hour standoff over the weekend when militants took hostages at an army base. Health Care Debate . AZUZ: Back here in the U.S., everyone watching the debate over health care reform has their attention focused on the Senate Finance Committee today. That is because the group is voting on a health care bill. This is the last committee vote before the issue moves to the full House and Senate. The bill that the Senate Finance Committee is considering is referred to as the Baucus Plan, named for Sen. Max Baucus, who heads up the committee. It's a 10-year plan that would cost the government $829 billion. But a new report says that American families would have to pay a hefty price as well. America's Health Insurance Plans says under the Baucus Bill, the amount that families pay for health care would go up 111 percent by 2019. The group says that under the current system, costs would go up 79 percent. A White House spokesman says the report is inaccurate and self-serving. He points out that it was created by the insurance industry, which he calls one of the biggest opponents of health insurance reform. Is this Legit? BRENDAN GAGE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? There is a Nobel Prize for economics. Legit! The award for economics was created in 1968, adding to the existing Nobel Prizes for physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace. Nobel Prize for Economics . AZUZ: In the 40 years since the Nobel Prize for Economics was established, the winners had all been men. That changed yesterday, when Elinor Ostrom was named one of the recipients of this year's award. The other winner is Oliver Williamson. They're both experts in how the economy and businesses are regulated. Ostrom told reporters that when she first decided to pursue a post graduate degree, she was told that no major university would even think of hiring a woman. She's proof times have changed. PROF. ELINOR OSTROM, NOBEL ECONOMICS PRIZE LAUREATE: I think we're entering a new, we've already entered, a new era, and we recognize that women have the capabilities of doing great scientific work. And yes, I appreciate that this is an honor to be the first woman, but I won't be the last. Recession Over? AZUZ: Sticking with financial news, more than 80 percent of the country's top economists believe the recession is over. That's based on a survey done by the National Association for Business Economics. However, most economists think it could take months before there's any kind of serious improvement in terms of the housing market or job losses. The unemployment rate is expected to hit 10 percent between now and the end of the year, and to stay at that level through the first three months of 2010. European Trip . AZUZ: And looking overseas, that is where you'll find Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She's on a six-day trip to parts of Europe and Russia, addressing issues like arms control, health care and some long-running conflicts. Jill Dougherty checks in from a stop in the UK, where Sec. Clinton was focused on the relationship between the U.S. and one of its closest allies. (BEGIN VIDEO) JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C. Were the handshakes with the foreign secretary a little firmer? The smiles broader? The hugs and kisses with the prime minister warmer than usual? It seemed that way, as Hillary Clinton put America and Great Britain's ""special relationship"" on display. U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: It is a special relationship. I have a special, personal relationship with the prime minister, and of course I think it can't be said often enough we have a special relationship between our countries. DOUGHERTY: Her mission: calm concerns in London that the Obama administration's relationship with the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown may be cooling. But on a range of international issues, there's no daylight between the two countries. CLINTON: Decisions about the future of Iran are up to the Iranian people. But we will continue to speak out on behalf of human rights, on behalf of democracy, on behalf of freedom of expression, . DAVID MILIBAND, UK FOREIGN MINISTER: Our insistence that it is not for us to choose the government of Iran is clear. But also, our insistence that it is right to stand up for human rights around the world, for universal values, is also very clear. DOUGHERTY: At Sec. Clinton's next stops here in Dublin and then in Belfast, she highlighted another aspect of the special relationship: the Northern Ireland peace process. CLINTON: Many people who are despairing over the prospects of peace look to Northern Ireland. They think to themselves that if it could be done there, then perhaps we too have a chance to try to cross that border between conflict and peace and chart a different future for ourselves and our children.

That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! South Africa 2010 . AZUZ: And next June, the soccer world will be focused on South Africa when that country hosts the World Cup. Imagine if the Super Bowl included teams from around the world and only happened once every four years. That gives you an idea of how huge the World Cup is. Robyn Curnow shows us how South Africa is preparing for the soccer spotlight. (BEGIN VIDEO) ROBYN CURNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Watered and protected from the hot South African sun, these are the first green shoots growing on the pitch where the opening game of the World Cup will kick off in June next year. Stadiums across the country will be ready by early next year, say FIFA officials, who with clipboards in hand, have just inspected of all the match venues. So, while all of these stadiums are on track to be completed ahead of time, despite workers downing tools and going on strike a few months ago, there still is a lot more work to be done to ensure FIFA is satisfied. JOSEPH BLATTER, FIFA PRESIDENT: For the time being, let us be with 7.5. CURNOW: That's the score FIFA President Joseph Blatter gave South Africa for the Confederations Cup played here in July, and which was seen as a test case for the South Africans. FIFA and South Africa are all too aware of where the problems were and where they remain. DANNY JORDAAN, LOCAL ORGANIZING COMMITTEE: The areas we have been focusing on are accommodation, transportation and security. Those were the three key areas. CURNOW: The organizing committee here concedes if there are big matches at small town stadiums, like this one in Rustenberg, there simply will not be enough places for fans to sleep. JORDAAN: Some of the host cities won't have sufficient beds, and therefore it means that we'll have to go outside those host cities. CURNOW: Also, transport remains a headache. The system is haphazard, irregular and often unsafe. A new bus transit system in Johannesburg has started running, but its routes are limited. Other towns have little or no organized transport systems. Getting from host city to host city, most fans will have to rely on South Africa's well-developed air network. The Johannesburg airport will be open 24 hours, and much has been spent on upgrading its facilities, including managing and protecting the estimated 40,000 pieces of luggage expected through here a day. SBU NDEBELE, TRANSPORT MINISTER: If we had World Cup in December, we would be already on top of the situation. We are ready. CURNOW: Police say they will also be ready to protect 500,000 fans traveling here next year. Robyn Curnow, CNN, Johannesburg, South Africa. (END VIDEO CLIP) Before We Go .

"(CNN) -- It produced one of the memorable sporting moments of 2013 and now the excitement is starting to brew all over again for America's Cup fans. The first buoy of the 35th edition of sailing's most prestigious race was rounded on Thursday as the challengers to reigning champions Oracle Team USA were announced. Five teams from Britain, Italy, Sweden, France and New Zealand will battle in out to determine who will race the U.S. team in 2017. Oracle, skippered by Jimmy Spithill, pulled off one of sport's great comebacks last September when they overhauled a 1-8 deficit against the Emirates Team from New Zealand to eventually win 9-8. Spithill is looking forward to see who his team will face. ""It's exciting to look at the roster of teams who are lining up against us,"" Spithill said on the competition's official website. ""We're facing five strong challengers who have a lot of resources, talent and experience. ""But our team is very competitive. We love challenges -- the bigger, the better. It's very easy to get motivated when you see what we're going to be facing."" Among the teams looking to deny the U.S. team a third consecutive victory will be a crew led by Britain's Ben Ainslie. Ainslie, a four-time Olympic champion who played a key role in the Oracle team's victory last time around, will lead a team from Royal Yacht Squadron -- the club who originally awarded the trophy in 1851. ""We are delighted that Royal Yacht Squadron Racing's challenge for the 35th America's Cup has been officially accepted,"" Ainslie said in a statement. ""The America's Cup originates from the Squadron and it is our goal to return the Cup to where it belongs."" Fellow Brit, Iain Percy will skipper Sweden's Artemis Racing team. Percy, a double Olympic champion, will be looking to honor the memory of his great friend and teammate Andrew ""Bart"" Simpson who was tragically killed when the Artemis boat capsized during training for last year's competition. New Zealand's Emirates Team will be hoping to bounce back from their catastrophic defeat in San Francisco Bay. ""We see some formidable opposition taking shape in the 35th America's Cup and we have no illusions about the job ahead,"" skipper Dean Barker said in a statement. ""We have been working quietly behind the scenes towards this day almost since the last day of the 34th America's Cup. Now the real work begins."" Italy's Luna Rosa Challenge and Team France complete the line up. The five challengers will race at venues around the world next year and in 2016. The outcome of these races will decide a ""top challenger"" that will go forward to race the U.S. team in 2017 at a venue in either Bermuda or San Diego.

Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Kicking off a new month of commercial-free news, I'm Carl Azuz and this is CNN Student News! Glad to have you with us. First Up: Indonesian Earthquake . AZUZ: We begin in Indonesia, where officials are working to determine the full impact of a major earthquake. The difficulty is that the tremor, which struck around 5 p.m. local time yesterday, caused widespread power and phone outages. Initial reports did indicate that the quake killed at least 75 people. Officials believe hundreds more may be injured and thousands may be trapped. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.6; that's what classifies it as a ""major"" quake. It struck about 33 miles from the capital city of west Sumatra. Scientists said they couldn't speculate on whether it was connected to another deadly quake that struck in the Pacific the day before. Samoa Earthquake . AZUZ: That deadly tremor took place in the Samoan Islands. Officials say it claimed more than a hundred lives and flattened entire villages. President Obama has declared the situation a major disaster to help speed up aid efforts. Some of the damage was caused by three tsunamis created by the quake. Chad Myers explains how that happens. CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: What happens is that the earth moves under the water, and when the earth moves, you start to push up or push down that part of the earth, eventually there's going to be a wave get caused by that movement of the earth. There's where it was. There's American Samoa right there. It's kind of an ugly mess. Here's how it happens: Literally, there are two plates -- well, a number of plates -- but there are two plates that really were affected here in parts of American Samoa yesterday. Gonna rewind you all the way back here, and I'm gonna play it for you, and here it goes. One plate, the subduction plate, one plate on top begins to get crunched, and then kind of separated, and then all of a sudden, it's that energy that is released all at one time. And it's like the inverse of throwing a stone in a pond, but you get the same waves coming out of the middle. Fast Facts . BRENDAN GAGE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, was created in 1957. Its mission is to push for safe and secure nuclear technologies. Part of the way it does that is by setting standards for nuclear safety and by inspecting nuclear facilities to make sure they're being used for peaceful purposes only. Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei leads the IAEA, and in 2005, the agency won the Nobel Peace Prize. Iran's Inspections . AZUZ: Doctor ElBaradei is weighing in on Iran's controversial nuclear program. He says the country doesn't appear to be making nuclear weapons, but it did break the law by not telling the IAEA about its newest nuclear facility before the thing was built. This all comes before today's scheduled meeting where several countries, including Iran, are discussing the program. Reza Sayah has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REZA SAYAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT, ISLAMABAD: Mohamed ElBaradei's comments about Iran's controversial nuclear program much more tempered and even-handed than what we've heard coming out of Washington and Tehran these days. The head of U.N.'s nuclear watchdog coming out and saying two significant things. First off, Mr. ElBaradei saying that indeed Iran did break the law when it did not disclose this uranium enrichment facility earlier. Mr. ElBaradei saying Iran should have disclosed it during the planning stages. But he also added that the IAEA has yet to find any evidence that indeed Iran is going after nuclear bombs. So, he basically gave both sides in this nuclear debate something to work with going into Thursday's talks in Geneva. Here's what Mr. ElBaradei had to say in an exclusive interview with our sister station, CNN-IBN. DIRECTOR GENERAL MOHAMED ELBARADEI, INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY: I don't think, based on what we see, that Iran has an ongoing nuclear weapons program. Whether they have done some weaponization studies as was claimed by the U.S. and others, this is one of those issues that is still outstanding. But I haven't seen any credible evidence to suggest that Iran is having an ongoing nuclear weapon program today. I hope that they are not having one. SAYAH: That was Mr. ElBaradei, saying he hopes Iran is not going after nuclear bombs. But it is the position of Washington and European leaders that they can no longer afford to hope. They need to be certain because they say Iran's leaders have lost credibility when it comes to the nuclear issue, and the only way they can be certain is if Iran curbs uranium enrichment and grants access to all its facilities throughout the country, whether they've been declared or not. Look for that to be a focal point in these landmark negotiations in Geneva on Thursday. Reza Sayah, CNN, Islamabad. (END VIDEO CLIP) Shoutout .

Education Secretary Arne Duncan is responsible for overseeing the government's education programs and policies. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Longer School Day . AZUZ: The Education Department oversees those policies, but most decisions are actually made by state and local officials. That's why Secretary Duncan is going around the country trying to convince those officials to get behind a plan that President Obama is pushing, which would change how long you guys spend in school. Alina Cho looks at the potential pros and cons. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE GALLAGHER, PARENT: So, we get an extra day! ALINA CHO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's 3:00 in the afternoon, and Steve Gallagher has just picked up his 10-year-old daughter Sammy from school, right in the middle of the work day. A longer school day for Sammy, what President Obama wants, means a more convenient day for dad. STEVE GALLAGHER: It kind of works into our personal schedule. For example, I can then have the ability to pick my daughter up after school, as opposed to cutting my work day short. CHO: The idea is gaining steam. Education Secretary Arne Duncan is touring the country with unconventional allies -- the Reverend Al Sharpton and Newt Gingrich -- encouraging local districts and states to embrace the idea of longer school days and a longer school year, saying the current system is outdated, a century old, when kids needed summers off to help on the farm. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. This is the right word. CHO: Duncan says students who thrive are in class longer. ARNE DUNCAN, EDUCATION SECRETARY: Guess what? They're in school nine hours a day, they're in school on the weekends, and they're in school over the summer, and, you know, this is not a new idea. CHO: American students have one of the shortest school years in the world: 180 days, versus 195 for most European nations and 200 for East Asian countries. And U.S. students spend fewer hours a day in the classroom; 35 hours a week. Swedish students are in class 60 hours a week. The nation's largest teacher's union says more seat time is good, but after school programs at school? Better. RANDI WEINGARTEN, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: We have them for mediation, we have them for enrichment, we have them for sports, we have them for art, we have them for music. Those are really good things. SAMMY GALLAGHER, STUDENT: Four times four is 16. CHO: Steve Gallagher is all for longer school days, but summers off? CHO: Some might argue longer school day, longer school year, could work to our advantage. STEVE GALLAGHER: I agree with that, but it's difficult to make that cultural shift within our country on just an edict from the president. CHO: So, what does 10-year-old Sammy think about the president's proposal? SAMMY GALLAGHER: Well, longer school days usually means more homework, and for a lot of people homework can be very overwhelming in a way. CHO: Something else that could be overwhelming: the cost. The National Taxpayers Union, a conservative group, says yeah, it all looks good on paper, but there are hidden costs involved, like potentially more money for teachers, higher electricity bills when you keep schools open longer. And who's going to foot the bill? Probably taxpayers. Alina Cho, CNN, New York. (END VIDEO CLIP) Promo . AZUZ: One day you definitely won't be in school: Thanksgiving!

Iraq Dust Storms - Explore the impact of desertification on Iraq's plants and people. Bolt Mania - Witness the whirlwind of success surrounding the world's fastest man. Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Your commercial-free source for classroom news is pondering probes, planets and pumas! I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now. First Up: Interrogation Report . AZUZ: First up, the U.S. government launches an investigation into methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency to question suspects. Attorney General Eric Holder, the country's top law enforcement officer, said he knew it would raise controversy when he announced the investigation yesterday, but he's seen enough information to move forward. That information comes from a report written by the CIA in 2004 about the techniques used by some of its agents. Former President George W. Bush authorized what were called ""enhanced interrogation"" methods after the September 11th attacks. Those methods were used on suspected terrorists. The CIA report refers to some of the techniques that were used as unauthorized. Attorney General Holder's investigation is looking into whether or not the interrogations were illegal. The CIA says it didn't endorse any behavior that went outside the bounds of official guidelines. Holder says this investigation will not focus on the people who carried out the questioning, who were following the guidance of the Bush administration. The second most powerful person in that administration, Vice President Dick Cheney, says that the interrogation methods and the program as a whole were needed to keep the country safe. FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY: The intelligence officers who questioned the terrorists can be proud of their work and proud of the results, because they prevented the violent death of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people. AZUZ: Attorney General Holder is also considering the country's safety, and says the investigation won't pose a threat to it. U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL, ERIC HOLDER: We will not be doing anything that would endanger the American people or in some way lessen our national security. New Interrogation . AZUZ: In the meantime, President Obama is making a change when it comes to who handles the questioning of suspected terrorists. That responsibility is shifting from the CIA to the FBI and a special unit of terrorist interrogators. The change is based on a recommendation of a task force that the president created after he took office. The new unit will make sure that future interrogations meet certain restrictions outlined in a U.S. Army manual. Is this Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? There are officially nine planets in our solar system. Not legit! According to the International Astronomical Union, there are eight planets, after Pluto was downgraded three years ago. Pondering Pluto . AZUZ: Two U.S. states -- Illinois and New Mexico -- have voted to re-instate Pluto's status as a planet. Three years ago, the International Astronomical Union voted that Pluto was a dwarf planet, and that knocked it off the list of official planets. So, what is a planet? One: it orbits the sun. Two: it must be nearly round. Three: there can't be other objects in its path. That last one was the sticking point; Pluto's orbit has ice and rocks in its path. Other scientists argue that any round object that orbits the sun should be a planet, and that would include Pluto. Iraq Dust Storms . AZUZ: Moving from planets to plant life, or the lack of it. It's a problem in parts of Iraq, and it's being caused by a process called desertification. That's when plants and soil dry up and the land turns into a desert. Arwa Damon examines the impact that this is having in the Middle Eastern nation, not just on the plants, but on the people. (BEGIN VIDEO) ARWA DAMON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is a typical dust storm: the unnatural and eerie orange glow, minimal visibility as suffocating tiny particles stirred up by desert winds descend on the people, causing obvious respiratory health concerns. Over the last few years, the frequency and intensity of these storms have increased, and experts say that's an indication of a much more ominous problem: the desertification of Iraq. FADHIL FARAJI, MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE: ""This is a real catastrophe,"" Fadhil Faraji of Iraq's agriculture ministry says, ""because this crisis threatens food security in this country."" DAMON: Iraq was among the region's most fertile areas thanks to the flowing rivers of the Euphrates and the Tigris. But take a look at the Tigris today: it's anything but flowing. In fact, no one who we have spoken to has ever seen its levels this low. Jawad Khadim and his father take us on a tour of their once fertile land, which has been in the family for generations. They show us their now dying crops. JAWAD KADHIM, FARMER: ""The risk with the increase of desertification,"" he explains, ""is that farmers will leave their farms and start looking for new jobs."" DAMON: Their farm, for example, only produces around 50 percent of what it used to, barely enough to feed and clothe this extended family of 45 that relies on these lands. KADHIM GAZI, FARMER: ""There has been no rain in the past three years,"" Khadim's father tells us, ""and we've had more sandstorms. We've never experienced weather this bad."" DAMON: Iraq's agriculture ministry estimates that 90 percent of the country's lands now produce unprofitable food. FARAJI: ""When there is a food shortage,"" Faraji warns, ""people will turn to other methods to get what they need, and that includes violence."" (END VIDEO) ID Me . JONES: See if you can I.D. Me!

Bolt bolted 100 meters in 9.58 seconds, 200 meters in 19.19 seconds - I don't think I drive that fast.

PLEITGEN: How about this for legendary: Berlin dedicated an original piece of the infamous Berlin Wall to Bolt to be displayed in his homeland, Jamaica. BOLT: It's definitely it's an honor. I got my face painted all over it. I'm going to put it in front of my house if I can get it there. I'm looking for that. It was an honor getting a piece of the wall. PLEITGEN: Many are trying to grab a piece of the pie. There's the Jamaican tourism board, and Puma's Jamaica collection is flying off the shelves. Usain Bolt's big success means big money for his sponsor Puma. You have the Usain Bolt hoodie shirt, a whole Jamaica collection, including t-shirts, and the Usain Bolt shoes, which are sold out in almost every store.

Tiananmen Square . AZUZ: Today marks the 20th anniversary of China's violent response to a group of dissidents protesting in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The demonstrators, many of whom were college students, were speaking out against political policies in the communist nation. Their protests drew the attention of the world. Kristie Lu Stout looks back at the events that led up to the historic moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR, HONG KONG: In the spring of 1989, the elements for a perfect storm were coming together in Beijing. By the late '80s, a new mood was being felt in the socialist world. Old ways were being challenged. In China too, students and intellectuals were finding new voices, openly discussing taboo topics like democracy and freedom. Even within the communist party there were those who saw reform as the only way forward. And then on April 15th, a momentous death. Hu Yaobang, once the head of the Chinese communist party, had spent the last two years of his life in obscurity. He had fallen foul of hardliners for his reformist views. What followed was a staggering outpouring of grief and anger. Thousands of students flocked into Tiananmen Square. While efforts were made to keep students out, they repeatedly broke through police lines. And amazingly, in a country with no free press and tight controls on foreign media, the world watched these events unfold. By coincidence, the world's media happened to be in Beijing for a historic summit between China and the Soviet Union. From expressions of grief, the students moved to demands, including a new appraisal of Hu Yaobang, a free press and the right to protest. And it was infectious. Workers, civil servants and others all joined the crowds in Tiananmen. Similar demonstrations broke out in cities throughout China. Domestic media began reporting on the events with unprecedented independence. Upping the ante, the students declared a hunger strike. In meetings with government officials, their demands grew more strident. But after weeks of soft persuasion by moderate officials, the party elders had had enough. The reformist General-Secretary Zhao Ziyang made an emotional last public appearance. In a surprise visit to the square, he told students, ""We have failed you."" And yes, that's Wen Jiaobao, China's current prime minister, standing right next to him. That night Zhao was removed from office, and Prime Minister Li Peng declared martial law. ""The Goddess of Democracy"" is soon unveiled and becomes a rallying point for the hundreds of thousands now gathered there. The occupation continued until the night of June 3. Tanks rumbled through the streets of Beijing. And in the early hours of June 4th, 1989, the People's Liberation opened fire. The Chinese Red Cross initially reported 2,600 people died over the two days, but later retracted that figure. The official figure stands at 241 dead and 7,000 wounded. Perhaps the most enduring image of Tiananmen is what happened on June the 5th. This lone protester stood defiantly in front of a line of tanks. The world watched and held its breath, until onlookers dragged him away. The ""tank man"" captivated the world and, to this day, his identity remains a mystery. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEO CLIP) Security Crackdown . AZUZ: A powerful image. The Tiananmen Square demonstration, and especially the image of that single protester and the tanks, became famous. But China often tries to downplay the event. This week, one official referred to it as simply ""a political incident that took place in the late 1980s."" And as John Vause shows us, the government doesn't seem too keen on coverage of the anniversary. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN VAUSE, CNN CORRESPONDENT, BEIJING: These plainclothes officials are using these umbrellas here to block our view whenever we try and do any videotaping anywhere near the square. They're also carrying these walkie talkies, right there. That gentleman has a walkie talkie. So does this other gentleman here. Authorities are also rounding up dissidents. Many, they say, according to some reports, in fact, have been sent out out of town. Others have been detained. University students, too, have also been warned to watch what they say, and there is also heavy security around many of the schools and some of the bigger campuses in Beijing. And right now, as you can see, these officials continually blocking our view to try and stop us from filing any kind of report from Tiananmen Square. (END VIDEO CLIP) Shoutout . RAMSAY: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Templeton's social science classes at Concord High School in Concord, Michigan. Which of these is NOT a type of grass? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Bermuda, B) Centipede, C) Millipede or D) Blue? You've got three seconds -- GO! Bermuda, blue and centipede, sure; but there's no such thing as millipede grass. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! No More Yard Work? AZUZ: No matter what kind of grass you've got this time of year, it all needs cutting. It's not a fun chore, as many of you know, and some folks might even hire you to take care of it for them. But if you're looking for an automated option, and you have just a few thousand bucks to spare, a new mini-mower may be right up your alley. Sean Callebs explains the unique yard service. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN CALLEBS, CNN CORRESPONDENT, NEW ORLEANS: This summer, the Lynch family wants to spend more time playing and less time working. MITZI LYNCH, HOMEOWNER: It's actually nice to not having to be outside for hours doing yard work for hours on a Saturday afternoon . CALLEBS: They're hoping this little robot can help. LYNCH: My son decided to call it ""mowie."" CALLEBS: Its real name is ""automower,"" a battery-operated and self-charging device that could give your lawn that freshly mowed look and you'll never even break a sweat. So, how does it work? Simply program the times you want it to start and stop, then a wire installed around your yard lets automower know where to cut and guides it back home when it needs recharging. GENT SIMMONS, PRODUCT MANAGER, HUSQVARNA: It can operate day, night, rain, wind, doesn't matter. Automower is designed to be out there whenever you need it out there, regardless of the weather conditions. CALLEBS: And this gadget is just as ""green"" as the grass it clips. The automower doesn't use gas or oil and gives off zero emissions. Plus... SIMMONS: You don't have to have chemicals or fertilizers to put down. The grass decomposing actually acts as a natural fertilizer. I think you are going to see more traditional mowers that will have alternative fuels, more traditional mowers that will have battery technology. This is the way that the industry is trending. CALLEBS: Sean Callebs, CNN. (END VIDEO CLIP) Stay in touch this summer . AZUZ: After tomorrow, our show is taking a two-month break. But we're not going away completely over the summer!

Plenty of ways for you to spend your summer with CNN Student News! Before We Go . AZUZ: And finally, it is normal to see animals hanging out in trees. Not quite as normal when it's a bear. And even less normal when that tree is in the middle of a neighborhood! But that is what happened in Wisconsin this week. The bear found himself a nice perch and just kind of hung around for a while. No wild ending here. Eventually, it just came down on its own. Which experts say is the right way to handle this situation. Goodbye . AZUZ: So remember, the next time you see a bear in a tree, just leaf him alone. Yeah, I know it. That was just horrible.

"(CNN) -- By 2050, minorities will be the majority in America, and the number of residents older than 65 will more than double, according to projections released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau looks at 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing, mortality rates and migration. Minorities, classified as those of any race other than non-Hispanic, single-race whites, currently constitute about a third of the U.S. population, according to Census figures. But by 2042, they are projected to become the majority, making up more than half the population. By 2050, 54 percent of the population will be minorities. Minority children are projected to reach that milestone even sooner. By 2023, the bureau said, more than half of all children will be minorities. ""Part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups, Hispanics in particular,"" said Dave Waddington, chief of the Census Bureau's population projection branch, which issued the report. ""Those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age. Non-Hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older."" The projections are based on Census 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing, mortality rates and net international migration, the bureau said. The group predicted to post the most dramatic gain is the Hispanic population. It is projected to nearly triple, from 46.7 million to 132.8 million, from 2008 through 2050, the bureau said. Its share of the total U.S. population is expected to double from 15 to 30 percent. ""Thus, one in three U.S. residents would be Hispanic,"" the Census Bureau said in a news release. The African-American population is projected to increase from 41.1 million to 65.7 million by 2050, going from 14 percent of the U.S. population to 15 percent. The Asian-American population is expected to increase from 15.5 million to 40.6 million, or from 5.1 percent to 9.2 percent of the population. Among the remaining races, the bureau said, American Indians and Alaska natives are projected to increase from 3.9 million to 8.6 million, going from 1.6 percent to 2 percent of the U.S. population. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are expected to more than double, increasing from 1.1 to 2.6 million. In addition, the number of U.S. residents identifying themselves as being of two or more races is projected to more than triple, increasing to 16.2 million from its current 5.2 million, the Census Bureau said. Meanwhile, the non-Hispanic white population is not expected to post dramatic gains in the same period. By 2050, whites are expected to number 203.3 million, slightly increased from the 2008 number of 199.8 million. Whites will comprise 46 percent of the U.S. population by 2050, down from the current level of 66 percent, the bureau said, as the group is projected to lose population in the 2030s and 2040s. By 2030, all baby boomers will be age 65 and older -- comprising nearly 20 percent of U.S. residents, or one in five Americans, the bureau said. By 2050, the 65-and-older age group will increase to 88.5 million, more than doubling its current number of 38.7 million. Meanwhile, the number of those age 85 and older is expected to more than triple, from 5.4 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050. Non-Hispanic whites make up most of the baby boomers, Waddington said. ""They're in a higher mortality rate ... nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster"" instead of reproducing at the rate projected for minorities. Obviously, the projections will have ""very strong policy implications,"" he said -- medical care for an increasingly elderly population, for instance, educational needs for increasing numbers of minority children and economic effects for the labor force. ""Who's going to do the jobs that are characteristically held right now by certain types of people?"" Waddington said. ""All those things are subject to change."" The United States is projected to reach the 400 million population milestone in 2039, according to bureau projections. By 2050, the population is expected to be 439 million. Of those, 235.7 million are expected to be minorities. As U.S. cities and towns have increasingly become more diverse, Census officials knew the day of a majority minority would come, Waddington said. And ""the aging one is sort of simple,"" he added. ""That's demography 101."" Other highlights from the report released Thursday: . • By 2050, 62 percent of the nation's children will be minorities, up from 44 percent today. Of those, 39 percent are projected to be Hispanic, up from 22 percent in 2008, and 38 percent are projected to be white, down from 56 percent in 2008 . • The percentage of the U.S. population between the ages of 18 and 64 -- the ""working age"" population -- is projected to decrease to 57 percent in 2050 from 63 percent in 2008. • The working-age population will become more than 50 percent minority in 2039, and by 2050 will constitute 55 percent of the population. • By 2050, the working-age population will be more than 30 percent Hispanic, up from 15 percent in 2008; 15 percent African-American, up from 13 percent in 2008; and 9.6 percent Asian, up from 5.3 percent in 2008. Waddington said the timelines are not written in stone. ""It's a projection. And things like the baby boom generation couldn't be predicted."" Major changes in policy affecting families and children, or a major policy affecting immigration, could have an impact on the expectations, he said. The nation's undocumented workers -- estimated at 12 million or more -- are included in the projections, Waddington said. Census data includes all U.S. residents, regardless of their legal status, he said. CNN's Ashley Broughton contributed to this report.","Census: By 2050, 54 percent will be other than non-Hispanic, single-race whites .

"(CNN) -- I was happy to return to Rio, this beautiful city which I have visited several times. Twenty years after the first Earth Summit, I came to Rio, like many people from all over the world, to put the world on a different pathway -- one leading to sustainable development. But, the leaders gathered here came without an intergenerational vision and they failed to rise to the challenge; they did not break their ties with the old ways of doing things -- ways that are proved to be unsustainable and inequitable. Read more: Five cities fighting for climate survival . If the government representatives had heard the heartfelt yearning for change, for a vision of the future that the broad base of men, women -- and even children -- shared during numerous side events, and in the Sustainable Development Dialogues organized by the Brazilian government, perhaps they would have given their negotiators a stronger mandate: A mandate to create the future we want and which the earth needs. Unfortunately these voices were not incorporated into the declaration text and many leave for home frustrated and angry. I urge those who are disappointed by the lack of urgency and commitment to channel their frustration positively to work on a parallel pathway to fill the gaps left by the Rio text and to deliver the futures we all need. More: Rio+20 summit must not ignore rapid population growth . I had the pleasure of participating in numerous events during the conference where we discussed the role of women's empowerment in sustainable development, the importance of making real progress on food and nutrition security and the need to improve access to sustainable energy for the poorest. Underlying all of these discussions was the importance of upholding human rights and not backsliding on any existing commitments, while striving for a more equitable world. The Rio declaration does set some important processes in train, like developing Sustainable Development Goals, which address all three dimensions of sustainable development: Environmental, social and economic. These should be action oriented, aspirational and measurable, so that they complement the Millennium Development Goals. Likewise, processes have been established to strengthen environmental governance at the international level and to make progress on financing for sustainable development. Read more: 7 billion reasons to empower women . The current declaration reaffirms the Rio Principles and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, it worries me that negotiations revealed a desire by some to step back from established commitments and principles. The restating of these commitments is therefore considered a success, only because these principles and values were under threat. More seriously, the backsliding on reproductive rights -- first established in 1994 at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development and reiterated at the Beijing Women's Conference -- is simply not acceptable, as highlighted by numerous women leaders in their statements to the Rio Summit. More: The elephant in the room at Rio summit . Arising from the failure of political leadership here in Rio, our hope is that people everywhere will accept that we all have to take responsibility and mobilize ourselves. Helped by social media and easier communication across the globe, we can make sure that the world we pass on to our children and grandchildren is safe, equitable, prosperous and sustainable. I was encouraged as I listened to many heads of state at the summit, who stressed their desire for a more concrete outcome. But this desire came too late: They should have engaged earlier in the process, they could have seized the moment and given stronger leadership. This possibility of a once in a generation moment passed us by and we will regret it. Happily the lack of political leadership was countered by the incredible vitality, determination and commitment of civil society -- from young people, women, trade unions, grassroots communities, faith-based organizations and the private sector. The legacy of Rio+20 will not just be the text of the Declaration hopefully it will be the mobilization of people to build the future they desire. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Robinson.","Mary Robinson: A once in a generation chance to commit to sustainable development passed world by in Rio .

Peace Prize Awarded - Study the praise and challenges that accompany President Obama's Nobel Prize. Space Station's Future? - Discuss how the international space station could become an abandoned laboratory . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's Columbus Day! Some interesting info on that, just part of what you will find on CNN Student News today. What you will not find are commercials. I'm Carl Azuz, let's get started. First Up: Pakistan Attack . AZUZ: First up, a rescue mission ends a 22-hour standoff between militants and government forces in Pakistan. All this started on Saturday with an attack on an army post in Rawalpindi, which claimed the lives of six guards and five gunmen. Militants then took control of the army headquarters. They held dozens of people hostage and threatened to blow up the building. That sparked the standoff that lasted nearly a full day. Pakistani officials say they were in communication with the militants throughout the ordeal. On Sunday morning, the situation came to a close when Pakistani forces carried out a rescue operation that freed a total of 39 hostages. The militant who led the assault on the army facility was also captured. And according to one Pakistani military official, the Taliban said it was responsible for the attack. I.D. Me . NINETTE SOSA, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm an award that was first established in 1901. I'm given at an annual ceremony in Oslo, Norway on December 10. Some of my winners include Martin Luther King, Jr., UNICEF and the International Atomic Energy Agency. I'm the Nobel Peace Prize, named for a Swedish chemist and engineer named Alfred Nobel. Peace Prize Awarded . AZUZ: And the winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize: President Barack Obama! The announcement came last Friday and it came as a surprise to some people, including the President himself, who said he considers the award a ""call to action."" The reaction, both from around the U.S. and around the world, has been mixed. Ed Henry has more on the award and the response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Good morning. HENRY: Yes, he can win the Peace Prize on the same day his war council met again to consider sending up to 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan, while a second war is winding down but still raging in Iraq. Fresh reminders this award is more about the promise of change than actual change. OBAMA: We have to confront the world as we know it today. I am the commander in chief of a country that's responsible for ending a war and working in another theater to confront a ruthless adversary that directly threatens the American people and our allies. HENRY: The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited the president's ability to create a new climate around the world. A deliberate approach from day one to break from the Bush years, especially with an historic speech to the Muslim world in Cairo. OBAMA: And I'm also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country. Salaam alaikum. HENRY: As well as major speeches in Prague and at the United Nations, laying out an aggressive plan to rid the world of nuclear weapons. OBAMA: All nations have the right to peaceful nuclear energy. That nations with nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move toward disarmament, and those without them have the responsibility to forsake them. HENRY: But so far, only great speeches, with little tangible results. ED ROLLINS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: I think, certainly, you have to give him an A for trying, but at the end of the day, what has he accomplished? HENRY: Not to mention the details of other accomplishments are still a little, well, fuzzy. OBAMA: I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed, and we are doing the hard work of forging a framework to combat extremism within the rule of law. HENRY: Top administration officials now admit they'll likely miss the January deadline of closing Guantanamo, a prime example of the difficulty of translating the president's vision into some actual victories. Ed Henry, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO CLIP) Two Issues . AZUZ: Okay, President Obama is getting some advice on one of the challenges mentioned in that report: the War in Afghanistan. A top U.S. commander has reportedly requested 40,000 additional troops for the conflict. Sen. John McCain says not following that recommendation would be ""an error of historic proportions."" Yesterday, CNN's John King asked Senator McCain about his biggest concerns when it comes to Afghanistan. JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR, STATE OF THE UNION WITH JOHN KING: Do you think the United States can win in Afghanistan with fewer than 40,000 more troops? SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) ARIZONA: I do not. And I think the great danger now is not an American pullout. I think the great danger now is a half measure. Sort of a, try to please all ends of the political spectrum. AZUZ: And the issue of gay rights gaining attention this weekend as the National Equality March took place in Washington, D.C. yesterday. Thousands of demonstrators took part, demanding full equality under the law. The day before, President Obama had addressed the nation's largest gay rights group. During his speech, he talked about protection against hate crimes, his support for the rights of gay couples, and his pledge to end the ban on gays in the U.S. military, what's known as the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy. Fast Facts . BRENDAN GAGE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for some Fast Facts! The first Columbus Day was celebrated in New York City in 1792 to mark the 300th anniversary of the explorer's first voyage to America. It's been observed every year since 1920, and features parades and ceremonies around the country. For decades, many states celebrated Columbus Day on October 12, because that's when Columbus landed in the Bahamas. But in 1971, Columbus Day became a federal U.S. holiday. And now, it's always celebrated on the second Monday of October, which makes today Columbus Day! Space Station's Future? AZUZ: From an Earth-bound explorer to exploration in the skies. The first part of the international space station was put in orbit back in 1998. Since then, modules and laboratories have been added, all with the goal of creating this massive research center to conduct science experiments. The only problem, as John Zarrella explains, is that it may never happen. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN MIAMI BUREAU CHIEF AND CORRESPONDENT: More than a decade of construction. The U.S. cost alone, including shuttle flights: $44 billion. That's right, billion with a B, and still counting. Now, after all that time and money, the international space station is ready to do world-class science. The problem is, it may be scuttled before it ever has the chance. ROBERT BRAUN, FORMER NASA CHIEF ENGINEER: The general idea that we would spend approximately 11 years building a space station, get it to its full operational capability and then kind of abandon it a few years later, to me personally, it doesn't make a lot of sense. ZARRELLA: That's exactly what might happen. Funding to keep the station in orbit will run out by 2015. The promise of cures for diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and ground-breaking research may never be realized. THOMAS PICKENS III, CHAIRMAN, ASTROGENETIX: We think that you can't do them on Earth. That the bias of gravity is so extreme that you really need to take it out of a gravitational influence and start doing these things in space. It's probably the only place to get these done. ZARRELLA: Tom Pickens' company is already reaping the benefits. A salmonella vaccine developed in space is moving through the Food and Drug Administration for approval. The last shuttle flight carried an experiment aimed at producing a vaccine for MRSA, a highly-resistant staph infection. The absence of gravity allows for the rapid growth of very virulent bacteria, perfect for building vaccines, says Pickens. PICKENS: That process on Earth is extremely long. It can take up to 10 years to do if they get it at all, and we've sent it up to space for really three trips and we found that we already had a vaccine for salmonella just after three trips. ZARRELLA: During its construction, the station has been used for some experiments, but not the kind that might produce miracle drugs and cures. Even if the station's life is extended, the science community acknowledges there are no guarantees the football field-sized flying laboratory will produce great breakthroughs. And getting funding for a ""maybe"" is tough. Still, the station's backers say funding to keep it flying is a no brainer. You don't spend a fortune on a house, they say, and then abandon it. So the question is, is the hope of great science, not the promise, enough for the Obama administration to keep the lights on? John Zarrella, CNN, Miami. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Well, it's a question you can answer too. Should the ISS be grounded? We'd love for you to weigh in with your thoughts on our blog. You can find that, you know where, on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com. Now before we go today, anyone hungry for a snack? Guess it's time for a trip to the vending machine and some delicious... apples? Apples! That's the whole point of these new products, which replace chocolate and chips with fruits and veggies. The goal is to help hungry folks make healty choices. And the company guarantees that the fresh foods won't go bad too quickly. Goodbye . AZUZ: You might think that fact would be ripe for a pun, it's just a good thing we could produce something that met our usual standards. But would you really want apples over chocolate? I mean it is healthier, but c'mon. Really? For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz. Make the healthy news choice.

"(CNN Student News) -- Students will make educated predictions about how many electoral votes each presidential candidate will capture in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Procedure . Have students review the origin, purpose and function of the Electoral College. Ask students: What is the ""winner take all"" system? Are there any states that do not follow this system? If so, how do they determine their electoral vote allocation? How many electoral votes are needed to win the presidency? Next, divide students into small groups and assign each group a current swing state in the 2008 presidential race. Consult the CNN Electoral Map Calculator for a list of swing states. Then, refer groups to online resources, including CNN's Election Center 2008 on the CNN Politics site, to identify the following for their assigned swing state: . After students complete their research, have each group analyze its data to determine which candidate it thinks will likely capture the swing state's electoral votes. Have each group present its prediction and the rationale behind it. Following the presentations, direct students to the CNN Electoral Map Calculator to log their predictions for all the U.S. states and calculate how many electoral votes they predict each presidential candidate will capture. Instruct students to create a chart and log their predictions for each U.S. state. After the election, compare students' predictions to the actual electoral vote outcome.

"(CNN) -- Oracle Team USA safely negotiated the choppy waters of sporting comebacks to pull off a memorable victory against New Zealand to defend the America's Cup. The crew, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, had looked sunk as they trailed 8-1 in the best-of-17-races elite sailing series. Down but not out, Team USA continued to develop their boat with the help of their land crew and made another key decision when Britain's Olympic champion sailor Ben Ainslie replaced John Kostecki as key tactician at 4-1 down.

"(CNN) -- The gap between Formula One's haves and have nots appears never to have been wider. While all-conquering Mercedes prepares for the title showdown in Abu Dhabi, a cash-strapped team at the back of the grid has been forced to ask for donations from F1 fans to fund its participation in the final race of the season. Caterham, like fellow minnow Marussia, has gone into administration and has missed the last two races in the United States and Brazil. Desperate to compete in the 2014 season finale, the team launched #RefuelCaterhamF1 with the express intention of raising £2.35 million ($3.76m) -- and set a self-imposed deadline of Friday, November 14 to achieve the target. Caterham is using a method called ""crowdfunding,"" where individuals or companies making a pledge are incentivized, depending on the amount promised. The Caterham team's administrators turned to one of the market leaders in this specialized area, Crowdcube, to run the appeal with fans directed to its website to see what is on offer. About $5 dollars will get a funder a badge or T shirt. More expensive items would include a front wing from a 2013 car, with the highest prices reserved for individuals or companies wishing to have their name or logo emblazoned on the team's cars. The approach has provoked a debate within F1 as to its merits -- with the sport's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone being typically blunt in his assessment. ""I think it's a disaster,"" he told reporters at last weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix. Luke Lang, the co-founder of Crowdcube, flatly rejected that criticism. ""I think that's a disappointing statement,"" he told CNN. ""Caterham has worked tremendously hard to compete in F1 and some of the goalposts have moved slightly over the last for or five years to make it even more difficult. ""I think comments like that are not particularly helpful."" What is not in doubt is the appeal for cash has proved successful with over £1 million ($1.6m) raised in the first two days of the appeal and the halfway target reached by Tuesday. Items such as the front wings or team overalls were proving particularly popular with donors. It was Finbarr O'Connell, the Caterham administrator and for now its team principal, who came up with the idea, and like Lang is unapologetic about the approach. ""There are 200 people in the (Caterham) factory who were not paid for October and they deserve as much support as they can get,"" he told CNN. ""He (Ecclestone) has now had races where two teams weren't there and three others were hinting at boycotts, so that's not good for him."" O'Connell believes that getting Caterham to the start line in Abu Dhabi -- where there will be ""huge interest"" in seeing which of the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg takes the F1 title -- will help him firm up the interest shown by potential buyers of the team. ""We are not talking about crowdfunding a team, we are talking about a single stepping stone to showcase it to investors in a race setting. ""This is a sharp injection in the arm to cure an immediate financial crisis but they will only survive if a new purchaser comes forward,"" he added. Lang said this ""one-off"" approach was new ground for his company as well. ""It's a deviation from our usual business model where investors get equity shares or an interest payment in return for their investment,"" he said. ""But it was an opportunity we could not set aside because Caterham is such an iconic British brand and we are doing what we can to help out."" Caterham is not even the first team with links to F1 to use crowdfunding to fund its activities. The iconic former Brabham team has raised over $400,000 by this method as it attempts to return to the grid after a 20-year absence. O'Connell is increasingly confident they will reach their ambitious target and line up on the grid on Sunday week. ""Interest all over the world is growing exponentially, a mixture of enthusiasts who want to buy expensive things and even non sports fans with sympathy for our cause,"" he said. ""People like Renault (Caterham's engine supplier) and Total Oil have also been incredibly supportive."" After the initial flurry of interest, donations slowed a little ahead of Friday's deadline, but according to Lang this is a familiar pattern. ""There tends to be a real burst of activity, then a slight plateau in the middle, followed by a resurgence of interest as the deadline nears. ""There are over a quarter of a million views on the page and I am really confident they are going to reach their target."" That will mean good news for Caterham's Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi, who has still to find a seat for the 2015 season. His Swedish teammate Marcus Ericsson has been signed by Sauber off the back of a big personal sponsorship package. Exactly how many cars will be on the grid in Abu Dhabi also remains an open question. O'Connell's firm Smith and Williamson is a key player in the UK restructuring business and he told CNN that his own sources within the industry were talking up a rescue bid for Marussia. Reeling from the horrific crash which has left its star driver Jules Bianchi in a critical but stable condition in a Japanese hospital, the Anglo-Russian team was dealt a further blow when its administrator announced last Friday that it had folded. ""The finality of that statement surprised me,"" said O'Connell. ""I still think there could be more positive news for Marussia ahead of the Abu Dhabi race,"" he added. The two points gained by Bianchi for a superb ninth placed finish in the Monaco Grand Prix left Marussia in ninth spot in the constructors' standings. It would leave them set for a $50 million payout under F1's complicated rewards structure, having pipped Caterham for the vital 10th spot in the championship in 2013. By contrast, Mercedes will be set for a near $100 million payout in prize money for claiming top spot after a dominant season. But their operating budget, like those of other top teams such as Red Bull and Ferrari, is in excess of $300 million, dwarfing that of teams such as Caterham and Marussia. They will surely never have to resort to what Ecclestone labeled the ""begging bowl"" employed by Caterham, but O'Connell has no regrets as he battles to save the team. He came up with the idea of using crowdfunding while cycling up the steep Highgate Hill in London on his way home, in some way symbolizing the uphill struggles of Caterham since it entered F1 in 2010. ""It's such an interesting proposition, the belief that a team could be reconstituted by fan power,"" he said.","Cash strapped Caterham appeals to F1 fans to fund its team .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Beyonce defends using audio from the space shuttle Challenger disaster in a new song, calling it a ""tribute"" to the seven astronauts who died. The widow of Challenger's commander calls it ""disappointing."" The love song ""XO"" -- which was released on ""The Visual Album"" -- starts with the voice of NASA public affairs officer Steve Nesbitt: ""Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation. Obviously, a major malfunction."" This is what spectators at Kennedy Space Center or those watching on CNN heard in the first seconds after seeing the booster rockets spiral out of control in the blue sky above the Atlantic Ocean, 73 seconds after Challenger lifted off on January 28, 1986. ""The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten,"" Beyonce said in a statement reported by ABC News on Monday. ""My heart goes out to the families of those lost in the Challenger disaster,"" Beyonce said in her statement. ""The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you."" The love song's lyrics include the verse: ""We don't have forever, Baby daylight's wasting. You better kiss me before our time is run out."" Dr. June Scobee Rodgers, whose husband was flight commander Dick Scobee, reacted with a statement to CNN TV affiliate Central Florida News 13 in Orlando. ""We were disappointed to learn that an audio clip from the day we lost our heroic Challenger crew was used in the song 'XO,'"" she said.  ""The moment included in this song is an emotionally difficult one for the Challenger families, colleagues and friends."" The space agency also reacted. ""The Challenger accident is an important part of our history; a tragic reminder that space exploration is risky and should never be trivialized,"" NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said. ""NASA works everyday to honor the legacy of our fallen astronauts as we carry out our mission to reach for new heights and explore the universe.""

"(CNN) -- As the Formula One caravan geared up for the penultimate race of the season at Sao Paulo in Brazil, the wheels have finally ground to halt for one of the sport's 11 teams. Unable to race in last weekend's U.S. Grand Prix in Austin after sliding into administration, Marussia has folded with the loss of approximately 200 jobs after administrators failed to find new investors. ""It goes without saying that it is deeply regrettable that a business with such a great following in British and world motorsport has had to cease trading and close its doors,"" said Geoff Rowley, joint administrator and partner at FRP Advisory, in a statement . ""While the team made significant progress during its relatively short period of operation, operating a F1 team requires significant ongoing investment. ""Sadly no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form."" Marussia employees have been paid up to the end of the October and FRP promised "" to assist staff who have lost their jobs and provide them with the necessary support to submit timely claims to the Redundancy Payments Service."" Earlier in the season Marussia driver Jules Bianchi suffered severe head injuries in a crash at the Japanese Grand Prix. He remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition.

"(CNN) -- Take a walk along almost any beach in any part of the world and one's experience is often spoiled by the sight of trash -- flotsam and jetsam -- washed ashore from the ocean. It's a massive global problem, made worse by the modern use of plastics that do not readily biodegrade. One area of the North Pacific has earned the unwanted tag of ""the Great Pacific Garbage patch"" and covers double the size of Texas -- with an estimated six kilos of plastic for every kilo of natural plankton. This swirls about 20 meters below the surface of the water and, with other slowly degrading garbage, poses an obvious threat to marine life and the ecological balance. Marine conservation groups have long campaigned for better environmental protection of our oceans, but have now found high-profile support from a pair of world-class long-distance racing sailors -- Rob Windsor of the United States and Britain's Hannah Jenner. Sharp focus . They have brought into sharp focus a practice that neither other competitors taking part in epic yachting classics nor the sponsors of these events would ever wish to dwell upon. Crews -- desperate to free up space in their cramped conditions and ever mindful of the need to save weight -- leave their own trail of trash dumped overboard as they sail as fast as possible across the oceans. Until now it's been standard practice for their fellow competitors, who must balance environmental concerns with obvious practical necessity, particularly when at sea for extended periods. But Windsor and Jenner, among the favorites to win the Transat Jacques Vabre -- a month-long, 5,600-nautical-mile race from France to Brazil -- are pledging to stop the dumping as part of a new eco-friendly approach to ocean racing. ""Cleaner. Faster. Better"" is the motto of Windsor and Jenner's 11th Hour Racing team and they want to be as good as their word. The pair have been rigorously training for several months in their 40-foot monohull for the annual event, considered one of the most prestigious on the yachting calendar, which the 44 entries started from Le Havre on Thursday after a delay for bad weather. Education lesson . They both admitted that in the past they had been guilty of tossing items like tin and soda cans into the sea, believing that salt water would quickly eat it away. But working with the Rozalia Project, a non-profit organization committed to cleaning up our oceans, has been an eye-opener. ""The only trash we dump overboard during our journey will be toilet paper,"" Jenner told CNN, while acknowledging the scale of their task. ""We sailed back from Rhode Island earlier this year as part of our trials and decided to store how much rubbish we had built up,"" she said. ""Three people over six weeks and we came back with eight big bags of rubbish -- and probably six of those would usually be thrown over the side. It was shocking, really,"" she admitted. Using a series of advanced technological solutions and working with a nutritionist to help them reduce their reliance on numerous packets of freeze-dried food, the pair are confident they will achieve their goal. Future generations . ""I think we all have a responsibility to future generations to do everything we can to protect the environment,"" said Windsor. ""I am hoping that it will set a trend and trickle down across all levels and in particular recreational sailors."" Behind the pair's example-setting, trash-busting commitment lies a series of innovative technologies -- with the need to save weight being paramount. Their boat is equipped with a hydro generator, using the movement of the boat through the water to charge batteries and eliminating the need to run a diesel generator to power their on board facilities. It will also provide a massive weight saving because they will need less fuel. The hydro generator is backed up by solar panels to provide a further energy source for the navigational systems. It is customary for crews to take hundreds of bottles of drinking water on board for a race of this length, but Team 11th Hour is using their own water maker and desalination system to meet this need -- again a big weight saving. Perhaps the most innovative project the pair will be taking on board will see them attempt to grow fresh produce by harvesting seedlings to grow microgreens. Fresh food . The brainchild of the process is former team member Nick Halmos, who is hoping Windsor and Jenner will be able to supplement their diet of freeze-dried food with edible and healthy food nutrients. ""If we can do it successfully in the harsh conditions in the middle of an ocean it can definitely be transferred to urban environments, which is its target market,"" said Windsor. But it is a risk attempting to use such a mix of eco-friendly methods in a race situation. ""Other entrants have used some of these methods before, but we are the first to use all of them as a combination,"" said Jenner. But after months of grueling training, and taking part in warmup events such as the Fastnet Race, the pair are confident they can challenge for top honors. ""There's been lots of hard work getting to this stage, working our arses off with the ultimate aim to be on the podium,"" said Windsor. ""We are very competitive,"" chipped in Jenner, who at 1.67 meters tall and 58 kg is dwarfed by her 1.88m and 94 kg teammate. Competitive duo . ""Using Hannah's smarts and my brawn puts us in a position to do really, really well as a team,"" said Windsor. Jenner finished third in the 2011 Transat, while Windsor has a pair of second-place finishes in prestigious trans-Atlantic races, but they know the opposition this year will be tough, even before the added pressure of the environmental pledges. ""This is a hugely iconic race,"" said Windsor. ""In France offshore racing is huge, it can be compared with the interest in football in the UK and there is plenty of talent in the field."" Win or lose, both are keen to continue their partnership after the Transat, which they view now as being important in changing attitudes in the racing fleet and among the wider public. ""For us the important thing is to get the best result we can, but also our campaign is more than just getting a podium position,"" said Jenner. ""It's spreading a message about how we are being cleaner and faster and therefore better, and have that message spread to other sailors to help them run more environmentally friendly.""","11th Hour Racing an entrant in Transat Jacques Vabre .

"(CNN) -- Maryland became the eighth U.S. state to allow same-sex marriage Thursday as Gov. Martin O'Malley signed legislation he said secures the ""human dignity"" of all residents, including gay and lesbian couples. A standing-room crowd in the Maryland State House cheered O'Malley as he emerged from his office to sign the legislation, flanked by state Senate President Mike Miller and House Speaker Michael Busch. ""The way forward is always found through greater respect for the equal rights of all,"" the governor said. Six states and the District of Columbia already issue same-sex marriage licenses -- Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont. Five states -- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- allow civil unions that provide rights similar to marriage. The Maryland House of Delegates approved the measure O'Malley signed Thursday less than two weeks after Washington state legislators voted to legalize same-sex marriage. That measure will take effect in the summer if it survives a likely court challenge. New Jersey lawmakers approved same-sex marriage this month, but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed the legislation. He has said voters should decide the issue in a statewide referendum. Voters in North Carolina and Minnesota, meanwhile, will consider proposals in May and November, respectively, to ban gay marriage in those states. New Hampshire lawmakers may also consider a repeal of its same-sex marriage law, according to the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage. Lawsuits seeking to expand civil unions or turn back laws banning same-sex marriages are working through the courts in at least 12 states, including Hawaii, Minnesota and California, the organization said. Same-sex marriage became a national issue in 1993, after the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that a ban on such unions violated the state constitution. Legislation was introduced recently to allow same-sex marriages in Illinois, and bills from 2011 remain technically active in Hawaii and Minnesota, said Jack Tweedie of the National Council of State Legislatures. It's unclear whether any will see significant action, he said. An effort is also under way to put a proposal to legalize same-sex marriage on the November ballot in Maine, where voters previously overturned a 2009 state law authorizing it. In California, meanwhile, a federal appeals court recently ruled against a voter-passed referendum that outlawed same-sex marriage. It said such a ban was unconstitutional and singled out gays and lesbians for discrimination. The case appears to be eventually headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.","NEW: O'Malley's signature authorizes same-sex marriage in Maryland .

"Washington (CNN) -- Jeb Bush will be the star attraction at a Republican fundraiser in South Carolina next month, his first trip to an early presidential primary state as a possible contender for the Republican nomination in 2016. Bush, the former governor of Florida and a darling of the Republican Party's donor class, will headline a closed-door October 23 fundraiser for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by CNN. The high-dollar event will be held at the Capital City Club in downtown Columbia, a short walk from the South Carolina State House, putting Bush in the room with some of the early primary state's biggest GOP movers and shakers. How to campaign without campaigning . Couples who pledge $10,000 for Haley's re-election bid and the South Carolina Republican Party are offered the chance to participate in a ""roundtable discussion"" with Bush, while other GOP donors will be able to attend a private reception and photo op with the former governor. No public campaign events are scheduled. Bush has political ties to the state, thanks to his brother George W. Bush's hard-fought primary victory there in 2000 over John McCain. Bush family loyalists and financial backers of that campaign have been angling to get Jeb Bush to visit South Carolina for months, but he has kept a relatively low profile for much of this midterm year despite pleas from admirers to step more aggressively into the political arena. Still, Bush has put his expansive financial network to work for midterm candidates this year from his perch in Florida, hosting a cascade of fundraisers for Republicans, including an earlier event for Haley in Jacksonville that raised over $150,000 for her campaign. He also headlined Florida events for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. On Tuesday night, he is hosting a reception for GOP Senate candidates in Tampa. Politico reported this week that Bush also plans to hit the campaign trail in the coming weeks for Senate candidates in Kansas and North Carolina. Like most politicians dabbling in 2016 speculation, Bush has said he will decide whether or not to run for president sometime after the midterm elections.","Jeb Bush will travel to South Carolina next month .

"(CNN) -- At least 20 people were killed Monday when an explosion rocked a bus station in the northeast Nigerian city of Gombe, which has recently come under repeated attacks blamed on Boko Haram insurgents, officials said. The incident happened when a homemade bomb planted near a bus exploded as people were boarding â€Žat the Dukku bus station, triggering a fire that consumed vehicles, authorities said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. ""So far, 20 people have been killed in the explosion and another 18 were badly injured,"" said Mato Yakubu, Gombe state director of the National Orientation Agency (NOA). An official with the Nigerian Red Cross in the city said 20 bodies were evacuated to a local morgue. Later Monday, an explosion tore through a crowded market in the northern Nigerian city of Bauchi, killing 17 people and injuring 42 others, officials said. It wasn't immediately clear whether a bomb caused the Bauchi explosion, police said. The blast happened at about 5:30 p.m. (11:30 p.m. ET) in a section populated by cosmetics and blouse shops, causing a fire that spread to other parts of the market. ""(An) investigation is in progress to ascertain (the) cause of the explosion and level of damage to property,"" Bauchi state police spokesman Haruna Mohammed said. Bauchi is about 150 kilometers (93 miles) west of Gombe. Northern Nigeria, especially northeastern Nigeria, has been targeted regularly by Boko Haram since 2009. The Islamist militant group has fought an anti-government campaign to institute Sharia, or Islamic law, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings.","Bomb explodes under a bus in Gombe, Nigeria, police say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bettina Cox battled cervical cancer in 2012. A year later, the Texas native feels that narrowly qualifying for a Medicaid-sponsored program for low-income and uninsured female cancer patients saved her life. She now wants her governor and state legislature to support an expansion of Medicaid -- part of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act -- that she feels could save the lives of thousands of other women in her state by helping them detect diseases much earlier. But if Texas lawmakers have their way -- as well as governors and legislatures in Florida, South Carolina and nearly a dozen other states -- low-income Americans like Cox may not have expanded access to funds needed for such procedures. Those states feel the expansion is an unnecessary government overreach at a time when spending should be limited, not expanded. Still, for some, the impact on their lives is very real. Government reverses plan to cut Medicare Advantage rate . ""If I had Medicaid expansion, I would have found a doctor sooner than later,"" said Cox. At 60, she was too young to qualify for Medicare and said she was also told she didn't qualify for traditional Medicaid treatment available to women of childbearing age. ""As soon as I felt ill, I would have gone to go check."" Instead, Cox said, her tumor went unchecked for months, growing to the size of a grapefruit. Eventually an oncologist, working largely on a pro bono basis, properly diagnosed Cox as having stage 1 cervical cancer and helped her find health coverage under a Medicaid provision mandating treatment for women with breast and cervical cancer. The catch: The program was only available to women who weren't already covered by insurance or Medicaid. ""It saved my life, it actually saved my life,"" Cox said of the treatment she received. Political rising stars in Texas, like their counterparts in nearly half the country, are drawing partisan battle lines over extending federally subsidized health care to more than a million of the state's poorest residents. This week, a Texas showdown pitted Gov. Rick Perry against Democratic Party favorites the Castro brothers -- U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro and San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro -- in dueling press conferences on expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. ""I'm a self-employed artist and the mother of a 3-year-old and I'm not eligible to receive Medicaid. Private health insurance is not an option,"" Melissa Knight, who spoke at the Castro rally, said later. ""There are a lot of people who are working really hard. They aren't being lazy, they just don't have the means for extra insurance. It's about trying to provide for your family."" The faceoff was equal parts an ideological fight over the merits of Obamacare and a foreshadowing of how that policy will influence high-stakes political races. ""Medicaid expansion is a misguided, and ultimately doomed, attempt to mask the shortcomings of Obamacare,"" said Perry, a former Republican presidential candidate who is thought to be considering another run for the White House in 2016. ""It would benefit no one in our state to see their taxes skyrocket and our economy crushed as our budget crumbled under the weight of oppressive Medicaid costs."" ""Governor, being tough on people with no health insurance won't win you the Republican presidential primary in 2016,"" Joaquin Castro wrote in a Dallas Morning News op-ed. ""It definitely won't win you the presidency."" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, unleashed a similarly blistering critique of his Republican counterpart in South Carolina, Nikki Haley, in remarks to a Democratic Party conference in Charleston last month. O'Malley attacked Haley, who is up for re-election next year, as a ""tea party Republican"" who cares more about voter ID laws than expanding health care access and education for South Carolina. Then there's the plight of politicians like Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, who endorsed expanding Medicaid in his state using federal dollars in Florida, only to be met with opposition by fellow Republicans in the Sunshine State's legislature. Scott, who campaigned heavily against Obama's health care law in 2010, said he would accept the federal dollars last month, but his state's Republican-controlled legislature has since opposed the move. ""It's creating the same type of tensions among many conservatives that are taking place at the national level, at state level,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""You have a lot of governors who have national aspirations and have a huge incentive not to reject those funds. ... Then there are conservative legislators who have no national aspirations who are sticking to their position."" The Supreme Court ruled last year that states can opt out of broadening Medicaid coverage, striking down one of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Since then, about half of the states have said they'll opt in to expanded Medicaid. Nearly a quarter say they won't participate, with the remaining quarter still on the fence, according to figures from the Advisory Board Company, a policy consulting firm. ""Things got much more complicated,"" Don Berwick, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said of the Supreme Court ruling. ""There are now many more options where states can customize. ... In states where they are more politically ambivalent, it becomes more complicated."" Republican governors in at least eight states have agreed to Medicaid expansion, which would extend coverage to all adults with income below 138% of the poverty line. It's part of the Obama administration's push for universal insurance, and the federal government is dangling a big carrot to make it happen. It will cover each state's expansion costs in full for the first three years. After that, states will be responsible for no more than 10% of the tab. Some of the states that have decided to opt out have some of the highest uninsured rates in the nation. Take, for example, Texas, where nearly a quarter of the residents are uninsured. Some 1.75 million adults would be newly eligible if the state joins in. It stands to gain $25.3 billion in federal funds over four years to insure poor adults, while spending $1.3 billion, according to the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an advocacy group for low-income Texans. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission said Medicaid expansion would prove costly to the tune of ""tens of billions in combined state and federal funds over the next 10 years."" Still, in the end, the pushback against expansion may amount to just that, political experts said. ""If you're betting, you bet that in the end they're going to take the money. The states need money and this would cover a large amount of people,"" Zelizer said, adding that the holdouts will face mounting opposition both within and outside of their party. ""Part of it will come from moderate Republicans who don't want to have a party painted as extremists. Part of it will come from needs of the electorate because there is a great need."" People like Cox and Knight say lawmakers had better pay heed to that need. ""I feel frustrated because as a citizen because I don't feel supported by my leaders,"" Knight said. CNN's Peter Hamby, Kevin Liptak and Tami Luhby contributed to this report .","Half of states will expand Medicaid under Obamacare; half refuse or are on the fence .

"(CNN) -- ""Carrying bottled water is on its way to being as cool as smoking while pregnant,"" claims the video ""The Story of Bottled Water,""  which debuted on YouTube last month and garnered more than 450,000 views. Is it true? Are liters of Evian now beyond the pale? Is Dasani déclassé? Has bottled water become the new eco-no-no? Not quite yet. Though water sales have seen a recent downturn, plenty of folks are still paying for their daily hydration. In fact, Annie Leonard's video points out, Americans buy more than 500 million bottles of the stuff every week. It's second only to soda in popularity, and some industry analysts believe that by next year water will become the most-purchased beverage in the country. She wants to redirect the flow of water. The bottled water companies, the video insists, are ""scaring us, seducing us, misleading us"" into buying their products. Leonard, the writer and narrator, gives plenty of reasons why more and more people want to ""take back the tap."" But the International Bottled Water Association accuses the video of ""numerous false and misleading statements."" ""'The Story of Bottled Water' takes a very cynical view of the intelligence of consumers by depicting them as being dupes and victims of industry,"" said Tom Lauria, IBWA's vice president of communications. ""We think the opposite; that consumers are really quite thoughtful in selecting and enjoying a safe, healthy, convenient, calorie-free beverage that's delicious, refreshing and a very smart drink choice."" However, Leonard argues that not only does tap water often beat out bottled in blind taste tests, but bottled is often less regulated than tap. Tap water is monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, whose standards are generally stricter than the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees most bottled-water sales. Also, she says, tap water is certainly cheaper -- thousands of times cheaper. Not to mention that some of the best-selling bottled waters -- Pepsi's Aquafina and Coca-Cola's Dasani among them -- are, actually, nothing but filtered tap water. The companies have spelled this out on labels after pressure from the consumer watchdog group Corporate Accountability International. Add the fact that, according to Leonard, the amount of petroleum used to make water bottles every year is ""enough to fuel a million cars"" and that 80 percent of supposedly recyclable plastic bottles end up in landfills, you have the makings a ecological crusade. IBWA counters on its website that bottled water containers are 100 percent recyclable and the bottles are ""the nation's most recycled plastic container."" To back up its claims, the organization put its own video ""Good Stewards"" on YouTube. The bottle backlash has been bubbling up for a while. Tapping into civic pride . What the video calls ""one of the dumbest moves in advertising history"" happened back in 2006. High-end brand Fiji started a campaign intended to tout its expensively-imported-from-the-tropics water. ""The label says Fiji because it's not bottled in Cleveland,"" read the copy in a series of glossy magazine ads. This did not sit well with the good people of Cleveland, Ohio, who were rather proud of their city's tap water. Cleveland Public Utilities director Julius Ciaccia had the local water tested against the pricey bottled stuff. Fiji water had 6.31 micrograms of arsenic per liter; the city tap had zero. The company disputed the findings, but the first major battle of the water wars left Fiji looking less than pure. Thou shalt not bottle . Initial organized resistance to the bottled water industry came not from the usual urban green crowd, but from Christian groups. In 2006, members of the National Coalition of American Nuns pledged to avoid bottled water unless absolutely necessary. Later that year, the United Church of Christ partnered with the National Council of Churches to produce a documentary, ""Troubled Waters,"" about the ethics of water use, which aired on ABC. For many progressive people of faith, the very idea of privatizing water -- profiting from a shared natural resource -- is abhorrent. Bottled water is not just bad for the environment; to some, it's a sin. Restaurants follow suit . Since Perrier started marketing its mineral water as a luxury item in the 1970s, American restaurants have made a point of offering customers bottled water with their meals. But then famed California chef Alice Waters banned bottled water at her restaurant, Chez Panisse, in 2006. The next year she started serving patrons home-engineered sparkling water. Other Bay Area restaurants followed suit, and the idea made its way to New York, where celebrity chef Mario Batali's fanciest joint, Del Posto, banned the bottle. The idea became fashionable enough that a 2007 article in the online magazine Slate talked about the ""reverse snob appeal"" of tap water. Bottle Bans . A growing number of schools have active anti-bottled water movements. Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, was probably the first college to ban all bottled water sales on campus, back at the beginning of 2009; the University of Portland did the same a few months ago. Similar bans are being discussed at Wesleyan, American University and Evergreen State College, among other schools. Local governments are also getting into the act. San Francisco, California, Mayor Gavin Newsom was a pioneer, forbidding the use of city money to buy bottled water back in 2007. Seattle, Washington, followed suit the next year. During the recent Winter Olympic Games, Vancouver, British Columbia, started a campaign to encourage visitors to choose free local water over the bottle -- even though Dasani bottler Coca-Cola was a sponsor of the Games. Bottles under a microscope . Journalist Michael Pollan has turned into a hero -- and a best-selling author -- with his eco-conscious explorations of the food system; Morgan Spurlock found fame with his anti-fast food documentary ""Super Size Me."" Might bottled water be the new frontier in activist journalism? Reporter Elizabeth Royte was ahead of the curve with her 2008 book ""Bottlemania,"" a look at the people and economies behind the water industry. Environmental scientist Peter Gleick has just published ""Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water,"" which includes more than 100 bottled water recalls on everything from mold contamination to algae, bacteria, glass particles and -- believe or not -- crickets. Meanwhile ""Tapped,"" a new feature-length documentary by Stephanie Soechtig, has been screening the country with a ""Get Off the Bottle"" tour. Greener bottles . Bottled water companies haven't simply ignored all the criticism. The Nestle company, which bottles several brands of water, issued a study pointing out that water has a lower environmental impact than sports drinks and other beverages. Both Coca-Cola's Dasani and Pepsi's Aquafina have introduced new bottles that are supposedly ""greener"" than those used before. And Fiji maintains charitable and ecological campaigns to highlight the company's awareness. ""Greenwashing"" is the view of many in the environmental movement, who believe that this is all nothing but PR spin.","Advocacy video claims consumers are being scared into buying bottled water .

"(CNN) -- Horrific ethnic and religious violence resulting in ""mass murder"" and other abuses in two central Nigerian states has largely gone ignored by the authorities, rights group Human Rights Watch said Thursday. Its report, focused on Plateau and Kaduna states, is based on interviews with more than 180 witnesses and victims of violence as well as police investigators, prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges and community leaders. Many of the victims, including women and children, Christians and Muslims, ""were hacked to death, burned alive, or shot simply based on their ethnic or religious identity,"" said the report, ""Leave Everything to God: Accountability for Inter-Communal Violence in Plateau and Kaduna States, Nigeria."" And a seeming culture of impunity has created a cycle of violence as individuals who find no recourse elsewhere seek retribution for wrongs done to them, it said. ""Witnesses came forward to tell their stories, compiled lists of the dead and identified the attackers, but in most cases nothing was done,"" said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""The authorities may have forgotten these killings, but communities haven't. In the absence of justice, residents have resorted to violence to avenge their losses."" According to the report, communities in Plateau state have been plagued by sectarian violence for more than a decade, leaving thousands of Christians and Muslims dead. ""However, the Nigerian authorities have taken no meaningful steps to address underlying grievances or, until recently, bring to justice those responsible for the bloodshed,"" it said. Human Rights Watch lays much of the blame for the culture of impunity at the door of ""an already broken criminal justice system."" It points the finger at ""systemic corruption in the Nigeria Police Force,"" exacerbated by political pressure to protect those responsible for violence. The Nigerian police have not yet responded to repeated CNN requests for comment. Complex root causes . Much international attention has focused on recent violent attacks by the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria, particularly Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states. But the Human Rights Watch report paints a grim picture of life in Kaduna and Plateau states. Their location in Nigeria's ""Middle Belt,"" between the largely Muslim north and the predominantly Christian south, has put them at the intersection of sectarian strife in the large and unruly West African nation. ""Since 1992, more than 10,000 people in those two states have died in inter-communal bloodletting; several thousand of those deaths have occurred since 2010 alone,"" the report said. The root causes of the violence are complex, it said. While they often involve longstanding grievances and disputes, ""they are exacerbated both by divisive state and local government policies that discriminate on ethnic or religious lines and by the failure of authorities to hold to account those responsible for the violence."" The strife pits Hausa-Fulani Muslims -- the largest and most politically powerful group in northern Nigeria -- against smaller predominantly Christian ethnic groups, which counted together make up the majority of the population in the region, it said. Each side accuses the other of discrimination, oppression and violence to advance its position. Rights group urges reforms . In Plateau state, episodes of mass violence in 2001, 2004 and 2008 left hundreds of people dead, the report said. ""Following this violence, federal and state authorities took no meaningful steps to address underlying grievances and brought no one to justice for the bloodletting,"" the researchers said. The continuing tensions erupted in 2010, centered on the Plateau state capital of Jos, resulting in the massacre of hundreds of people, many of them Muslims in rural communities. While the federal authorities this time stepped in and prosecuted some suspects, most were not brought to justice, the report said. Many more sectarian attacks have followed. In Kaduna state, bloody episodes of ethnic and sectarian violence in 1992, 2000 and 2002 left hundreds or more dead -- and few perpetrators were held accountable. The authorities' response to different mass killings often follows a similar pattern, the report said. Police will round up hundreds of ""suspects"" but fail to gather evidence properly. This makes it difficult for prosecutors to file a case against any individual -- and ultimately most charges are quietly dropped, it said. Witnesses who did report crimes said police often took no action; others told researchers they were afraid to report them or did not do so because they believed the police would do nothing. The prosecution of suspects by federal authorities following the 2010 violence in Plateau state was an important exception to this pattern, Human Rights Watch said. The right group urges the federal government to ensure mass killings are swiftly and properly investigated by the police, to bar discriminatory policies that help fuel ethnic tensions and to treat the intercommunal violence as a criminal, rather than political, problem. Other recommendations include ordering a high-level review of police investigations into crimes alleged in the report, ensuring police are trained to do their jobs properly and reforming the police force. The Justice Ministry should identify why suspects in certain cases were not prosecuted and prosecute remaining suspects, it said. ""Nigerian authorities can and should take urgent steps to ensure that the perpetrators of communal violence, including mass murder, are investigated and prosecuted, and that victims are provided restitution or compensation for their enormous losses,"" the report said. CNN's Vlad Duthiers contributed to this report.","Rights group: Nigerian authorities are not doing enough to investigate mass killings .

"(CNN) -- ""Who is the nicest person you've met in showbiz?"" It's a question I'm often asked after nearly 20 years working at CNN. My encounter with Joe Cocker was relatively brief, but it left a lasting impression of a man who not only contributed a great deal to music, but also conducted himself with a rare professionalism and courtesy. The date was September 11, 1998, when Joe played Chastain Park Amphitheater in Atlanta -- an open-air venue which accommodates more than 5,000 people, but manages to maintain an intimate atmosphere, festooned with candlelit tables closer to the stage. It was a humid evening bedeviled by mosquitoes as I stood at the side of that stage with my cameraman awaiting the arrival of the rock legend -- a term with which Joe Cocker always felt uncomfortable. The plan was for a quick chat for CNN's global music show World Beat before his performance, but Joe was running late and the prospect of the interview was quickly disappearing. A publicist emerged from a side door to warn us that the window for the interview was about to close. He was unusually apologetic and appeared to be sincere. The singer's big band had already taken to the stage as we stood and watched the flurry of activity as roadies, sound techs and the other members of the touring family attended to last-minute duties. Then a single figure emerged from another doorway and walked briskly through the production area towards us. Dressed in what appeared to me to be a light-colored linen suit, he strode forward, shook our hands and said: ""Alright lads, I'm Joe. I'm really sorry to keep you waiting but if it's not too late for you, we can have a chat now."" He answered all the standard questions about his role in rock music, his iconic flailing appearance at Woodstock, the changing face of the business, his latest music, as a handful of increasingly fidgety minders checked their watches and glanced repeatedly over their shoulders. He appeared to consider his answers carefully and chuckled amiably, exhibiting none of the stress of the anxious assistants behind him. During our last question the band struck up what turned out to be the opening number with a great swell of brass joining the familiar rock sound. The audience cheered but Joe Cocker didn't bat an eyelid and continued with his answer. At its conclusion he smiled and said in the English Yorkshire accent which never left him: ""Well lads, it's been great to meet you and I've enjoyed chatting but I'd better be off now -- they're playing my tune."" And with a parting handshake he walked, unhurried, onto the stage and without breaking step, approached the microphone and began to sing, his distinctive voice booming out into the Georgia evening. A man confident in his craft, unassuming in his demeanor and impeccable in his manners. It shouldn't be remarkable and I won't claim to have got to know the man from such a snapshot moment but it left a very warm first impression of a man whose music has made an impression on millions around the world.

"(CNN) -- There's a popular African proverb that seems particularly relevant to this World Health Day: ""If you think you're too small to make a difference, try sleeping in a closed room with a mosquito."" Beyond their power to annoy, mosquitoes and other insects carry an outsized ability to kill, disable and disfigure people in massive numbers. Human history is closely linked to diseases carried by vectors such as the sand flies at the heart of blinding and disfiguring diseases referenced during biblical times, fleas responsible for bubonic plague in Medieval Europe, and the mosquitoes that carry one of today's most well-known diseases, malaria. What most people don't know, however, is that there are several other vector-borne diseases that have a staggering impact on the world's poorest people. Called neglected tropical diseases, or NTDs, this group of parasitic and bacterial infections plagues one in six people worldwide, including more than 500 million children. These diseases, such as lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, can cause severe deformities in sufferers and are one of the major reasons for lower economic productivity among adults and decreased school attendance among kids in poor and even middle-income countries, and pose a primary obstacle to achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly for education, nutrition, and maternal and child health. Potential success story . It's easy to focus on the bleak side of NTDs, but the truth is their control and elimination potentially represents the next major public health success story. There is now a worldwide effort to neutralize the threat posed by NTDs. A consortium of partners -- including the World Health Organization, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and 13 pharmaceutical companies -- came together two years ago to enact the London Declaration, a sweeping commitment by public, private and government partners to achieve control and elimination of 10 NTDs by 2020. In the time since, nearly 1.35 billion pills to treat several NTDs have been donated annually by the pharmaceutical sector, with a commitment to provide 14 billion treatments on average over 10 years. The value of these donations has been estimated at $19 billion through 2020 and is a primary reason for driving down the cost to treat and protect one person against multiple NTDs to less than 50 cents per year. Correspondingly, more than 70 countries have enacted plans to integrate NTD funding into their national budgets and focus greater health resources on NTD-related health programs, and we are seeing major progress in how NTD programs are integrated with other health and development initiatives involving water, sanitation and health (WASH), nutrition and education. All of this is big news. Since NTD pills do not require any clinics or medically trained personnel to administer, and are shelf-stable for long periods of time in hot climates, the task of getting them into the hands of the neediest communities is dramatically easier than other major health interventions. When treatments are given to a community over a sustained period of five to seven years, elimination of NTDs as a public health threat is achievable. In the case of vector-borne diseases, it means that the insects and snails that normally transmit parasites from one human to another can no longer infect the population with the parasitic loads usually derived from other infected people. Ending the diseases . With all the recent momentum for combating NTDs, we are now closer than we have ever been in history to finally seeing the end of these diseases. But we still have formidable barriers to overcome if we expect to reach broad control and elimination targets by the end of the decade. The global cost to achieving the 2020 NTD goals is relatively minimal relative to other health interventions: we have a funding gap of only $200 million per year to cover the expense of distributing the donated medicines to affected communities. Bridging this gap requires new partners to join the effort. NTDs offer one of the best returns on investment available in public health. Imagine: for only 50 cents per year, we have the potential to free a person to work more productively or excel in school, providing a path to increase lifetime earnings. Such a minimum investment yields the kind of returns that free the poorest communities to help grow, and participate in, market economies. For political and business leaders, NTD treatment should be seen as a basic investment that strengthens a country's potential labor and consumer force, tapping new sources of GDP growth. It is paramount global leaders prioritize NTDs on the post-2015 development agenda to make NTDs a plague of the past. All of the right factors align -- from donated, safe treatments and readily available school-based distribution points to an unmatched return on public health investment. With greater commitment by national governments, multinational and bilateral donors, corporate partners and philanthropists, we can reduce suffering on a mass scale and help millions of people achieve their full economic and social potential.

"(CNN) -- A suspect in the shooting death of South African soccer team captain Senzo Meyiwa has been charged with murder and robbery, a National Prosecuting Authority spokesman said Friday. Zanokuhle Mbatha appeared at the Boksburg Magistrate Court to face the charges and then was remanded in custody until November 11 to give him time to apply for legal aid, National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Nathi Mncube said on Twitter. ""There are still suspects outstanding & we appeal to public to continue providing info,"" authorities added on Twitter. Football world mourns death of South Africa captain Meyiwa . Meyiwa was shot and killed Sunday night during a botched robbery by intruders who went into a house in the Vosloorus township near Johannesburg, authorities said. Police haven't disclosed what led to the shooting, but local media circulated reports that it may have been over a mobile phone. Meyiwa, 27, was captain of the national team as well as his club, Orlando Pirates. Meyiwa began playing for the Pirates in 2005 and made his debut with the national team in June 2013. The goalkeeper didn't concede a single goal in the last four games in the African Cup of Nations qualifiers. His last match was Saturday when the Pirates advanced to the semifinals of the South African League Cup. The police have offered a reward of 150,000 rand ($13,670) for information leading to the ""arrest/conviction"" of suspects in the case.

"(CNN) -- New laws in Nigeria and Uganda, plus reports throughout the continent of extortion, murder, so-called ""curative rape"" and abuse of LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex) -- and their allies -- are deeply concerning to many people, in and outside of Africa. While Africa is not alone in this apparent trend, the vehemence of some of the homophobia, and the way it is being linked to pan-African struggles against Western imperialism, is striking. Not surprisingly, many people now view Africa as the most homophobic continent in the world. It is commendable that so many want to help in the fight against state-backed repression of sexual rights. Before rushing in, however, let's keep four things in mind. First, Africa is not a country. It is 54, 10 of which have signed the 2008 United Nations declaration recognizing sexual orientation and gender identity as human rights, including two which had originally opposed it but switched sides in 2011 (Rwanda and Sierra Leone). Consenting male adult homosexual acts are legal in 14 African countries, while female-female sexuality is largely ignored outside a handful. In 2004, Cape Verde joined South Africa in decriminalizing sodomy while Botswana and Mozambique have made discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexuality unlawful. The country of South Africa has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world for protecting human rights and was a co-sponsor of the United Nations' 2011 initiative to develop global strategies to end violence and discrimination against sexual minorities. One can be skeptical about international human rights statements and the reliability of the police and courts, especially for the poor majority. But important symbolic victories have been won in recent years across Africa, and in some cases policy reforms have been substantive. While not highly publicized, for example, many states now provide some health education, anti-retroviral medicine and other services to men who have sex with men (condoms in prison and the like). There has been an explosion of culturally sensitive scholarship by an emerging generation of African researchers that undermines homophobic claims. Gay-friendly art, literature, theatre, and films have also flourished. One of Kenya's best-known authors, Binyavanga Wainaina, publicly acknowledged he was gay just this year, joining a growing list of political, religious, and cultural figures in Africa who have spoken out forcefully against homophobia. Second: homophobia in Africa is real and dangerous, but appearances can be deceiving. Many of the factors contributing to the recent homophobic turn in African politics have their roots outside of Africa. Homophobes today often cite ""family values"" as a traditional reason Africans hate homosexuality, and it is true that there was a strong culture of extended families to help folks survive in often harsh environments. Yet the African philosophy of ""uBuntu"" meant keeping families together even when members strayed from the heterosexual, married, and fertile ideal. This meant tolerance accommodation with sexual difference as long as discretion was maintained. Enforced celibacy or abstinence, adultery, impotence, erotic preference for the same sex ... all these things were known and understood as part of the diversity of the world to which humans, ancestors and the yet-born could adapt. Islam as traditionally practiced in Africa was also relatively accommodating to the fact that individuals sometimes strayed from the ideal moral behavior. The family could be maintained through all of that by using discretion and appropriate rituals, prayers, sacrifice and/or compensation. Colonialism, Christianity and capitalism messed much of this up. The British in particular were almost systematic in their introduction of laws that criminalized male-male sex acts. European missionaries denounced them with the threat of eternal hell-fire. Families were meanwhile broken apart to serve the labor needs of the colonialists. Africans were taught that they had no history and no culture of value, indeed, maybe they were not even quite human. Political independence unfortunately did not solve this ideological hangover. On the contrary, since the 1980s especially, bad governance and economic turmoil have left much of the population of Africa frustrated. We in the West should not forget our role in creating the present shambles in so many African countries, whether through assassinations, bribery, or more subtle economic thumbscrews. The ""Washington consensus"" around neo-liberal structural adjustment was particularly devastating to families and social safety nets. In this context (rich getting richer, poor poorer), there is a widespread hunger for scapegoats and for simplistic solutions. Third, mainstream faiths have not been very good at addressing Africans' need for spiritual meaning after so many decades of economic and political malaise. The American Christian Right has by contrast been very active, and well-funded, in stepping in to fill that void. There is compelling evidence that American evangelicals have been instrumental in promoting Africans who will spread the homophobic message, including ghost writing speeches and advising on the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda. A similar ""homophobia international"" may be happening in Muslim-majority countries where the Islamic Right is gaining ground over traditional Sufi beliefs. In a place like Nigeria, where sectarian violence is a looming threat to the stability of the nation, homophobia is one of the few points of agreement for canny politicians to calm the sectarian waters. In a place like Uganda, which some see acting as a mercenary for American geopolitical schemes in the region, denouncing the West's so-called social imperialism is an easy way to cover complicity in a resurgent real imperialism on the continent. Finally, let us not forget that homophobia is not yet dead and buried in the West before we jump on our high horses. Maybe we can help our friends in Africa and ourselves by supporting African LGBTI in their efforts to strike at the Western roots of ""African homophobia."" A federal court case in Massachusetts bears watching, in which Uganda activists are suing an American Pastor"" who is charged with persecuting homosexuals. Their triumph in that case will surely be a bigger blow for the global cause of human rights than cutting off aid or imposing other sanctions on African people.

"(CNN) -- The image of Solomon Northup's body hanging from a tree -- noose around his neck, hands tied behind his back, feet barely touching the ground -- is uncomfortable to look at. And Steve McQueen, director of ""12 Years a Slave,"" does not spare the audience with an expedient exit. There is no overbearing soundtrack to drown out the sound of him gasping for air. For what feels like an eternity, McQueen makes us watch. He makes us listen. He makes us know the truth about slavery in a way no Hollywood film in recent memory has. The beatings are not brief. Christianity is not spared. There are no scenes of white heroes racing against time to save him or undo the injustice that is being done. As he hangs there, we hear the birds singing. We see the sun fading. We feel the fear coursing through the body of a slave who risks her own life just to bring him a sip of water. The film shows unflinching moments that shed an unflattering light on something our culture prefers to gloss over, perhaps as a way of healing. Just like calling people who point out racial inequality ""race baiters"" is supposedly an effective way to move on. Oh, we're willing to talk about slavery. But we like the stories told like ""Lincoln"": inspirational, with redeemable characters and very few scenes of actual slavery because, well, that's a downer. Because of this, McQueen's Oscar nomination for best director is welcomed, Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance as Northup worthy of praise and the best picture nomination for ""12 Years"" deserving. And yet, in one important way, something is missing. For if the Oscars were held today and ""12 Years"" won best picture -- as some favor it to do -- it would be one of the lowest-grossing winners of the award ever. With proceeds just a hair under $40 million since its October release, it would join ""The Hurt Locker,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""Amadeus"" and ""The Artist"" as the only best picture winners not to crack the top five at the box office. To put this in perspective, the latest Tyler Perry in drag movie made more in less than a month. There is a chance that could change, because historically, there is a surge in interest in movies that are Oscar darlings. Even ""The Hurt Locker"" -- the lowest-grossing best picture winner to date -- enjoyed an 11.9% increase in box office receipts after Oscar nominations were announced. When the film won best picture, it jumped 13.6% from the week prior to the win. Perhaps in anticipation of a similar increase in demand -- and on the heels of a best drama win at the Golden Globes -- Fox Searchlight is reportedly planning to bring the movie to 500 more theaters this upcoming weekend, with the goal of raising the total to 1,000 in the next two weeks. Before the Globes, ""12 Years"" was in only 114 theaters. The film will be in position to make more money. The question is: Who will go see it? Because word on the street is that ""12 Years"" is an unapologetic portrayal of our ugly past, and Americans prefer our history with some nips and tucks. Even now, as we are about to celebrate the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., we prefer to talk about the impact of his dream while limiting the mention of the nightmares that gave birth to that dream. How many of us will pay to see the scathing truth when refuge in fantasies are far more comforting? How many of us are ready for a film whose narrative is not dominated by white protagonists but rather a free black man who, in 1841, was kidnapped, tortured and sold? To see ""12 Years"" is to find out that ""nigga"" as a term of endearment is a misguided delusion. To see ""12 Years"" is to see the full story of what those who fought under the shadow of the Confederate flag gave their lives to keep. To see ""12 Years"" is to see that the claim that the black people who picked cotton in the field with the star of ""Duck Dynasty"" were ""happy"" is a racist insult. The movie is an unsanitized portrait of a nation's shameful past. It is two hours of breathing in the antebellum South and then walking out of the theater trying to pretend the stench is all gone. There is no question that ""12 Years a Slave"" was the best picture of 2013. But as the box office receipts show, not many of us are ready for that kind of honesty.

The twins are the first children born to Charlene Wittstock, the former South African Olympic swimmer who married Prince Albert II in 2011.

""The Princess and the children are doing well,"" the royal family said. Prince Albert hadn't been married before, but he did have two children born out of wedlock in 1992 and 2003. Yet it's the twins born to Wittstock who will get first crack at the throne, because Monaco law dictates that ""succession passes, upon death or abdication, to the direct legitimate (descendant) of the previous prince."" And in this case, it would be Albert's son Jacques, even though he arrived after his sister. While Gabriella will be the ""second child in the line of succession,"" according to the royal family, Jacques ""is the Crown Prince"" and receives the title of Marquis of Baux (in Provence).

"(CNN) -- South Africans paid tribute to Nelson Mandela on the first anniversary of his death, with his widow imploring citizens to carry on his legacy of love and forgiveness. Mandela, 95, died on December 5, 2013, after battling a recurring lung infection. Officials scheduled a series of events Friday to mark the anniversary of his death, including a wreath-laying ceremony, a cricket match and blaring of vuvuzelas, followed by moments of silence. His wife, Graca Machel, was among attendees at one of the first events of the day: a wreath-laying ceremony at his statue in Pretoria. During the ceremony, she spoke of her husband's legacy and the need to carry it forward. ""Madiba's legacy covers everyone in the country, in Africa and in the world,"" she said. 'I was not able to think, I was numb' She called on everyone to tap into his legacy of forgiveness, and ensure everything he stood for lives on long after he is gone. Machel also mentioned her sorrow at her husband's death, and the feeling of emptiness that washed over her. ""When he left he said, 'I leave you in peace and I want you to live in peace,'"" she said. ""On the day of his passing I was not able to think, I was numb."" 'Tall and proud' However, she said, she got solace from knowing her husband is at peace and is with friends who died before him. She mentioned some of his closest friends, including Oliver Tambo, with whom Mandela operated the nation's first black law firm. ""Looking back, I imagine him tall and proud, walking, and all of them rising to welcome him,"" Machel said. The revered statesman emerged from prison in 1990 after 27 years in detention to lead South Africa out of decades of apartheid. Mandela's defiance of white minority rule and incarceration for fighting against segregation focused the world's attention on apartheid, the legalized racial segregation enforced by the South African government. Quiet final years . In the years leading up to his death, he battled various ailments, forcing him to retreat to a quiet life and fade from the limelight.

His foundation will also have a three-minute, seven-second blaring of vuvuzelas and traditional horns, followed by three minutes of silence.

"(CNN) -- Bored with boot-camp, or sick of spinning? Growing numbers are getting their kicks out of pre-work rave parties as the way to shed calories and gain a natural high. It's 7.30 on a foggy Wednesday morning and heavy bass is thick in the air outside an industrial-looking venue in East London. There's excited chatter in the queue, with clubbers dressed in everything from lycra bodysuits to cow costumes. Inside, a crowd of thousand are getting whipped up by the DJ as they bounce around on the dance floor. The tunes date back to the 1990s and plenty of people here remember the rave generation or were part of it. There are nurses, lawyers, parents with kids, a smattering of seniors and some teenyboppers too. This monthly event, called Morning Gloryville, is billed as drug-free. The only dealing is going on at the smoothie bar. On paper, it's hard to see how it works, but the vibe is full of energy. As for the dress code, you wear what you fancy and you dance how you want. ""I just feel very wired and on it, and ready to take on the day. I just wish it was just more often than once a month,"" said Martin Edwards, sporting a lycra jumpsuit and multi-colored cape. Morning Gloryville has found its way into 16 cities, with Berlin and Montreal the latest to sign up. Co-founder Sam Moyo says she's getting corporate inquiries to bring pre-work raves direct to the workplace. ""(There's) productivity, team building, mainly that happiness factor because companies are starting to realize actually above everything else happiness is the number one thing your team needs in order to be productive,"" she said. As the crowd clears off, it's all coats and dresses, jackets and ties. You'd have never known what they had been up to -- except for the smiles, and the odd smearing of glitter.","Growing numbers are getting their kicks out of pre-work rave parties .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Brittany Murphy, the bubbly, free-spirited actress who appeared in such films as ""Clueless"" and ""8 Mile,"" died Sunday, apparently of natural causes, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office said. She was 32. Murphy was pronounced dead at 10:04 a.m. PT Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Sally Stewart told CNN Radio. An autopsy had not been scheduled as of Sunday night, but Captain John Kades, a spokesman for the coroner's office, told CNN that there was no sign of foul play or trauma. He added that it's not unusual for a younger person to die of natural causes. The coroner's office is looking into Murphy's medical history. A final report could take up to eight weeks. The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the death, and robbery and homicide detectives will be at her home, LAPD spokeswoman Norma Eisenman said. ""The sudden loss of our beloved Brittany is a terrible tragedy,"" her family said in a statement issued by her publicist. ""She was our daughter, our wife, our love and a shining star. We ask you to respect our privacy at this time."" Funeral arrangements are pending, the family said. Murphy starred in several movies, including ""Just Married,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Riding in Cars with Boys."" She also voiced the character Luanne on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill."" She is survived by her husband, British screenwriter Simon Monjack, whom she married in 2007. Fans took to Murphy's official Facebook page Sunday to issue their condolences. ""She was a great actress and was going to go far in her career! She will be greatly missed!"" read one post. Murphy's former boyfriend and ""Just Married"" co-star Ashton Kutcher posted his reaction to the news via Twitter. ""2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine. My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany's family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon,"" Kutcher posted. He added later: ""see you on the other side kid."" Singer-actress Jessica Simpson tweeted: ""Brittany Murphy was an incredible ray of Light to so many people. Her smile was contagious. My prayers are with her family and loved ones."" Actress Alyssa Milano, who did a USO tour with Murphy in 2003, wrote on Twitter: ""She was a sweet soul, with a lot of talent and heart."" Murphy was best known for her work in a string of romantic comedies in the early 2000s, including lead roles in ""Uptown Girls"" alongside fellow Georgia native Dakota Fanning, and ""Little Black Book"" with Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates, but her movie roles had declined in recent years. Last month, Murphy reportedly was fired from ""The Caller,"" a movie she was working on in Puerto Rico. Her representative issued a statement to news outlets disputing the report, saying: ""She was not nor has she ever been fired from any job big or small. ... [Due] to creative differences Ms. Murphy and the production mutually parted ways,"" according to People magazine. In addition to her ""King of the Hill"" role, she lent her voice to a number of animated works including the TV series ""Futurama"" and the 2006 hit movie ""Happy Feet."" Her work as troubled teenagers in ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted"" also gained her critical acclaim. Murphy was the subject of tabloid gossip after she transformed from a pudgy brunette in 1995's ""Clueless"" to a petite, lithe blonde who graced the cover of such magazines as Cosmopolitan in 2005. She frequently denied rumors of an eating disorder and plastic surgery. Her love life also was fodder for gossip sites as she broke two engagements in 2004 and 2006, then married Monjack after only four months of dating. ""All these ridiculous people came out and said all this nonsense when we got married, [but] thank God we had the substance and the history within that to [say], 'Yeah, whatever!' "" Monjack told People magazine in a 2008 interview. ""We still don't understand what happened.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An American man has been arrested in Israel for allegedly acquiring explosives stolen from Israel's military that he planned to use to attack Muslim holy sites, Israeli authorities said Tuesday. According to Shin Beit, Israel's internal security service, Adam Livix, 30, was arrested in November under suspicion of possessing explosives with the intent of using them in a terrorist attack. He was taken into custody with ""various types of ammunition and explosives stolen from the IDF"" and admitted under interrogation that he had made preliminary surveys of potential targets, Shin Beit announced Tuesday. Livix had come to the region in 2013 from his native United States, where he was been wanted for suspected drug felonies, the Israeli security service reports. The Christian man lived in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank communities of Hebron and Bethlehem, where Shin Beit claims that he rebuffed a Palestinian activist's solicitation to assassinate President Barack Obama during the U.S. leader's visit to Israel. Livix then moved into Israel -- spending more than one year there illegally, since his entry permit expired in September 2013, according to prosecutors. In Israel, Livix ""falsely presented himself as a Navy SEAL"" -- an elite U.S. military special operation unit -- and ""dealt with various criminal activities and came up with ideas for a variety of terrorist attacks,"" Shin Beit said. Livix also ""expressed ... his negative opinion of the Arab population of Israel and his wish to harm sites in Israel holy to Islam,"" Israel's Justice Ministry said. The ministry added that, in October, the American man asked his roommate -- an Israeli soldier -- to get him explosives, even paying the soldier for them. When police were notified and went to search the residence, Livix tried to escape by jumping from a seventh floor window to a balcony a floor below, the ministry said. The Israeli agency added that an Israeli court ordered that Livix undergo a psychiatric examination, at his lawyer's request. The U.S. State Department was aware of the reports that an American had been arrested in Israel, but declined to comment on this case. CNN's Amir Tal and Ben Wedeman reported from Jerusalem, and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Shin Beit: American arrested with ""ammunition and explosives stolen from the IDF""

"(CNN) -- Soccer legend Pele remained in an intensive care unit Monday, a week after he was hospitalized with a urinary tract infection. The 74-year-old has no fever and is receiving antibiotics intravenously, according to doctors at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. They are planning tests on Tuesday to analyze the need for possible renal support. Pele, who was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, was admitted to the hospital November 24. He had recently undergone surgery at the same facility to remove kidney stones. The athletic icon had one kidney removed during his days as a player, said his aide, Jose Fornos Rodrigues. Known as ""The Black Pearl"" and ""The King,"" Pele is one of the best known names in all of sports. He burst onto the scene as a teenager, helping lead his native Brazil to the 1958 World Cup championship. Pele went on to star on two other World Cup title teams, in 1962 and 1970. He also had a breakthrough career with the Brazilian club Santos and later with the New York Cosmos of the now-defunct North American Soccer League. In 2000, Pele and Argentina's Diego Maradona were named co-Players of the Century by FIFA, the international soccer governing body. Since retiring from soccer, Pele has remained in the public eye as a product pitchman, ambassador for the sport of soccer and advocate for Brazil's poor, having grown up as one of them in the inland city of Tres Coracoes.

"(CNN) -- Bao Bao did a no-no and the shock sent her scrambling up a tree. The giant panda cub at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C. touched a ""hot wire"" in her yard, part of a warning system used by the zoo to show animals their boundaries, the zoo said. The shocking experience sent Bao Bao (pronounced bow-BOW) up a tree Tuesday afternoon. The 16-month-old cub climbed to a limb where she felt safe and was still perched there on Wednesday, visible on the zoo's livestream cam. After the gentle shock, zookeepers gave the cub's mother, Mei Xiang, access to the outdoor yard, and she spent the night keeping an eye on Bao Bao, ""a likely scenario for a mother panda to stay with her cub in the wild,"" the zoo said on its Facebook page. A zookeeper also spent the night in the panda house ""just in case they decided to come inside,"" the zoo said. The jolt is a part of life for growing animals in the zoo. ""This is a safe warning system used by zoos for containment,"" the National Zoo said. ""Bao Bao is perfectly fine and like all Zoo animals, she is still learning the boundaries of her habitat."" Many people commented about the event on the zoo's Facebook page. ""What amazed me is the deep concern of Mei Xiang, pacing throughout the yard and sleeping near her little one in the night rain, barely eating inside today, persistently pacing the yard and checking on BB.

Wrote Chris Nielsen Berg: ""Sounds like life with teenagers, who test the limits, stay out all night, and cause their parents no end of worry!"" The zoo reassured the world that the cub will return to the ground, sooner or later. ""The staff are adjusting the pandas' routine today and are confident that Bao Bao will come down when she is ready,"" the zoo said.

"(CNN) -- Sports fans worried about being caught between the World Cup and the Winter Olympics in 2022 have no need for concern, Olympic chiefs say. International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach told CNN that he had ""100%"" confidence that football's flagship event, which has been awarded to the Middle Eastern state of Qatar, wouldn't clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics. Timing is naturally key to hosting the Winter Games, which are typically held in February. Bach told CNN's Amanda Davies: ""It was very clear that it is nobody's interest to have such a clash and (FIFA) President Blatter gave a clear commitment that there would be no such clash."" Temperature concerns . It may be over seven years away, but the 2022 edition of football's flagship event is already causing organizers headaches. The sports' national federations and players' unions have raised concerns about the heat of the Qatari summer, saying the extreme temperatures would be hazardous to the health and well-being of the athletes. Temperature concerns have led to calls, including from European football chief Michel Platini, for the tournament to be held in the winter. FIFA has yet to confirm the scheduling for the event. Bach, however, is confident that Blatter will honor his promise to avoid scheduling conflicts. ""I have no reason not to believe that he would deliver on this commitment."" He said that he was ""100%"" confident ""because I always believe that people are taking reasonable decisions."" While European leagues are unhappy with the idea of a winter Cup, which would interfere with their domestic tournaments, the chairman of the European Clubs Association (ECA), Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, told CNN that it would be ""acceptable"" to change the schedule for just ""one season."" 2022 Games yet to be awarded . The 2022 Winter Olympics will be held either in Almaty, Kazakhstan, or the Chinese capital Beijing after all other bids were withdrawn. The Qatar edition of the World Cup itself is beset by controversy, as human rights groups have previously slammed the country's treatment of migrant workers. Qatar says it is reforming contentious practices, such as the kafala system, which ties employees to a specific employer. The system, according to Human Rights Watch and the International Trade Union Confederation, is open to systematic abuse and has created a de facto form of slavery for the more than one million migrant workers living within Qatar's borders. Allegations of corruption during the bidding process for both Qatar and the 2018 edition of the tournament, to be held in Russia, have tarnished organizing body FIFA's image.

"(CNN) -- The sudden responsibility of leadership is resting well on Steve Smith's shoulders and it needed a captain's knock from him to lift Australia to a respectable 259 for five wickets after day one of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Smith passed 1,000 Test runs for the year on the way to an undefeated 72 not out to send the majority of the huge 70,000 crowd at the MCG home happy. Brad Haddin was on 23 not out at stumps. Smith only took over from injured regular Australia skipper Michael Clarke for the second Test in Brisbane, which the home side won in four days to take a 2-0 lead in the best of four match series. Many expected the experienced Haddin to be elevated, but instead the selectors opted for the 25-year-old Smith and he has repaid their faith. He scored his second century of the series in Brisbane and is well set for a third in Melbourne when the match resumes on the second day. Clarke, injured his troublesome back and hamstring during the first Test in Adelaide, determined to play to honor his great friend and teammate Phillip Hughes, who died after a freak accident in a match in Sydney at the end of November. Clarke, Smith and David Warner all scored centuries in the emotion charged match, which had to be delayed following Hughes' death and funeral. Warner, who has also hit 1,000 Test runs in the calendar year, did not add a single run to that tally Friday, dismissed by Indian paceman Umesh Yadav for a duck. Chris Rogers and Shane Watson rallied the home side with a dogged 115-run stand but both were dismissed in a five-minute spell after lunch. Shaun Marsh (32) and debutant Joe Burns (13) both made starts but were unable to capitalize, leaving Smith, with good support from Haddin, to take Australia to the close in a respectable position. Yadav and fellow paceman Mohammed Shami both ended with two wickets for India, which has not won a Test at the MCG for 33 years. The tradition of starting Test matches in Australia on Boxing Day dates back to 1974, when arch-rival England was the tourist. In the 40 years since, it has proved to be a popular move, with vast crowds coming to the MCG in festive mood. Last year saw a world record crowd of over 91,000 pack the ground as Australia was on its way to inflicting a humbling 5-0 defeat on England in the Ashes Series. Test cricket matches, the longest form of the game and lasting five days, also started on Boxing Day between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Christchurch and South Africa and the West Indies in Port Elizabeth. Like at the MCG, New Zealand's match had an added poignancy following a tragedy, with the Hagley Oval being used for the first time since Christchurch was struck by a deadly earthquake in 2011, which claimed 185 lives. Kiwi skipper Brendon McCullum marked the occasion with a stunning 195 off just 134 balls to lift the home side to a dominant 429 for seven wickets at stumps on the first day.","Honors even after first day of Boxing Day Test at MCG .

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- Soldiers patrolling the streets, barely-begun construction sites and sewage-soaked waterways. The 2016 Olympic Games are still two years away, but the list of problems appears to be growing. The situation in Rio de Janeiro is so dire that the International Olympic Committee Vice President John Coates lashed out in April, calling preparations the ""the worst that I have experienced."" He had cited several problems, including water quality, social tensions and delayed venues, particularly the Deodoro Olympic Park, the second-biggest venue, where construction hasn't even begun. He later toned down his comments. As Brazil prepares to welcome hundreds of thousands of international fans to the World Cup in one week's time, it has to ensure the world it will also be ready for the Olympics two years later. The delays are exaggerated, says the director of communications for Rio's Local Organizing Committee, called Rio 2016. ""They decided to raise the yellow flag because they were probably scared we would be wasting time watching the World Cup,"" Mario Andrada told CNN in a recent interview. ""But there is zero risk that the venues won't be ready for the Games."" Rio 2016 says 38% of the sites are done, including 11 that are already operational, including the MaracanÃ£ Stadium which will host the World Cup Final. Preparing for 2016 . Progress at construction sites varies widely. Out in the beachside suburb of Barra da Tijuca, where many of the events will be held, the Olympic Village is at an advanced stage, with huge blocks of apartments being erected. At the nearby main Olympic Park, the foundations have been laid, but construction hasn't progressed much further. As for Deodoro, where the BMX, whitewater kayaking and rugby events will be held, construction isn't even expected to start until the second half of this year, but Andrada says they can quickly make up for lost time. ""Deodoro started late, even you could say more than six months late, but Deodoro is very simple to get organized,"" he said. ""The construction there is very easy."" Out on Guanabara Bay, the site of Olympic sailing and windsurfing events, plastic bags and old tennis shoes bob around in the water. Brazilian sailing gold medalist Eduardo Penido showed us the garbage boats that remove the flotsam from the area of play. ""It's a problem but not for sailing,"" he said. ""It's a problem for the environment."" According to biologist Mario Moscatelli, the bigger problem is what you can't see. ""You're going to put high-performance athletes in this water, that isn't even water, it's a toilet,"" he said during an interview overlooking the Marina Gloria, which will serve as the base for the Olympic sailing events. The stench of raw sewage wafted as he spoke. ""I hope authorities do what they promised, because beyond being an environmental and public health problem, it's a national embarrassment."" Even the best estimates from city officials say only 49% of Rio homes are connected to sewage lines. Rio de Janeiro's mayor, Eduardo Paes, says the athletes run no health risks, but admits the promised cleanup won't be complete before the Olympics. ""This is not going to be a problem for the games. This is a problem for us,"" he said. ""I always think the Olympics are a good excuse to get things done and i think we missed an opportunity."" Tackling crime . On the security front, authorities launched a so-called police pacification program back in 2008 aimed at forcing drug gangs out of the notoriously dangerous shantytowns or favelas. Police have moved into dozens of slums with mixed success. While crime rates in the shantytowns have broadly come down, there has been backlash from some residents and a resurgence in crime that prompted authorities to call in the army for help earlier this year, further denting Rio's reputation. At this point, it's too early to tell if the Olympics will face the same kind of widespread protests and discontent leveled at the World Cup. According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, 61% of those interviewed said they think hosting the World Cup is a bad thing because it takes money away from schools, health care and other public services. The Olympics budget has ballooned to $16 billion, but officials say it's a different story, because private money is largely being used to finance the venues. ""Most of the public money is being spent not on venues, not on fancy stadiums, but on legacy, on transportation, on sewage,"" said Paes, Rio's mayor, pointing to the extensive bus corridors that the city has already begun, that connects venues and isolated areas of the city. He'll have two years to convince Brazil and the world. After the World Cup ends on July 13, all eyes will be on Rio's Olympic Games.","As Brazil readies for World Cup, issues linger in Rio for Olympics two years away .

"(CNN) -- Basking in the glory of winning back the fabled Ashes from traditional rivals England, Australia's cricketing fans turned up in world record numbers Boxing Day in Melbourne to see their side continue its domination of the series. England closed on 226 for six wickets, with only Kevin Pietersen, undefeated on 67, suggesting they might post a challenging first innings total. Two late wickets with the second new ball for paceman Mitchell Johnson swung the initiative Australia's way to leave the majority of the 91,092 crowd at the MCG celebrating. The attendance broke a previous world best for attendance at a cricket match set 52 years ago in the same vast stadium. ""In years to come Melburnians will remember Boxing Day 2013 as the day their city created sporting history,"" Cricket Australia's CEO, James Sutherland, told Cricket Australia's website. England's loyal band of cricket supporters -- nicknamed 'The Barmy Army' -- also helped boost the figure, but with their team 3-0 down in the best of five-match series they came more in hope than expectation. Until Johnson's late first day burst, removing Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow, who had replaced the out-of-form Matt Prior as England's wicketkeeper, the visitors had held their own, although the scoring rate was pedestrian. Put in to bat by Australia's captain Michael Clarke, England made it to lunch for the loss of his counterpart Alastair Cook to Peter Siddle. Cook's opening partner Michael Carberry went after the interval, again failing to capitalize on a solid start to be bowled by Shane Watson for 38. That brought Pietersen to the wicket and he looked determined to atone for earlier failures in the series, which had led some to question his place in the side. He enjoyed a slice of luck, hooking a short ball from the excellent Ryan Harris in the direction of substitute fielder Nathan Coulter-Nile, who could only carry the ball over for a six. On 41, Harris almost had him again, but George Bailey could not hold a sharp chance at midwicket. Pietersen found support from Joe Root and Ian Bell, but both departed after starts to Harris, both caught behind by Brad Haddin, the Australia wicketkeeper. Stokes and Bairstow were unable to cope with the 90mph plus pace of Johnson, a key figure in Australia's three earlier wins. It left Pietersen at the wicket with Tim Bresnan and just the England tailenders to come. Bell, who starred for England in the summer when they beat Australia 3-0 in a home series, still held hope that Pietersen could lift them into a good position on the second day. ""With Kev not out it's a good sign for us,"" Bell told Sky Sports. ""A lot of us got starts and are disappointed not to get scores. We would have liked a few more runs as well,"" he admitted as the pattern of the earlier matches continued. ""We need big runs and we've not got them, but if Kev and Bres (Tim Bresnan) can hang around, maybe we will get 300 plus and put some pressure on Australia."" But with Johnson fired up, Australia will look to quickly remove the remaining England batsmen at the start of the second day and post a big score of their own in their bid to achieve a humiliating series whitewash of their oldest rivals. Meanwhile in other Test match action Thursday, India reached 181 for one wicket on the first day of the second Test against No.1 ranked South Africa in Durban. Indian batsmen Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara were sharing an unbeaten century partnership for the second wicket before bad light stopped play.","England 226 for six wickets at close of first day at MCG .

"(CNN) -- I thought I knew a thing or two about hunger. I've met thousands of people who struggle to feed themselves and their families, visited dozens of soup kitchens, food pantries, homeless shelters and food banks, and worked closely with nonprofit organizations in trying to find new ways to end hunger. I really thought I understood the scope of the problem. But let me tell you something -- I had no clue. My SNAP Challenge last week taught me that merely observing someone else's plight does not hold a candle to consciously altering your habits to better understand what it might be like to live someone else's life. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was formerly called the food stamp program. In the SNAP challenge, you live on a food and beverage budget of $4.50 a day, the average amount a recipient of food stamps gets in benefits. I was hungry last week -- laser-focused on how much food was left in the fridge and how many dollars were left in my wallet. I was scared about eating portions that were too big, and wasn't sure what to do if my food ran out. I canceled two scheduled dinners, knowing they were way beyond my budget. But I was doing this challenge on my own. Eighty percent of households that have problems putting food on the table include the most vulnerable -- children, the elderly and the disabled. Most people in the SNAP program would have considered my challenge as a ""household of one"" to be a luxury. My approach to grocery shopping was to try to stay full. That meant carbohydrates. In retrospect, it was a poor choice. I ended up with a diet largely based around pasta, lentils, chickpeas and cereal. While it wasn't a ton of food, I could mix and match for various meals and find myself not quite full -- but enough to get by. Breakfast and snacks were Toasted Oats. Lunch and dinner varied between chickpea, jalapeno and tomato soup, lentil casserole and pasta with tomato sauce and garlic. Fresh fruit, vegetables and yogurt were too expensive. I also gave up coffee because it didn't fit within the budget. I only drank water. My drastic change in diet made me listless and grumpy. But the seven days of this challenge happened in a vacuum. It was really just an imitation of a very real problem facing millions of Americans -- it wasn't my real life. It was over in a week. No other pressures weighed on my shoulders the way they do on those of people who use food stamps. I wasn't worrying about my car breaking down or not being able to pay for gas or having my electricity turned off or finding work or paying an unforeseen medical bill. All I had to worry about was my food, and that was challenging enough. One in six people in this country, or roughly 48 million Americans, face this reality. At the same time, they confront other obstacles and manage to deal with more pressing challenges every day. The statistics are alarming. However, it wasn't until I participated in the challenge and heard stories from the hundreds of people who responded to my blog posts that I really understood what a life of food insecurity means. One person wrote me, ""It's not about a weeklong 'challenge.' It's about months. It's about deciding whether to eat or buy heart medicine or diabetic drugs. ... It's about knowing that this week is followed by another and another and another. It's not about (whether or not food is) boring. It's about living."" I believed at first that by taking the challenge to eat on $4.50 a day diet, I could raise awareness about hunger. What has become clear is that those who are ""food insecure"" -- or even those living close to that edge -- are all too aware of their circumstances. Helping the hungry is not a zero sum game. We can discuss policy, and undoubtedly each of us will land on one side or the other of the political debate. Unfortunately, the debate we often hear in Washington leads to thinking that the issue can be seen in black or white, right or wrong, good or bad. We all know there are people who abuse the system. I have no doubt that there are some people who accept SNAP benefits when they either don't need the assistance or may not use them appropriately. But SNAP is really an efficient program. There are small problems with the system -- but there always are in large, complex systems. Tens of millions of people, most of whom are elderly or have children, rely on this safety net to help them cope with very difficult situations beyond their control. And we can all acknowledge our shared responsibility to help these fellow citizens survive and ultimately create productive lives of dignity. Throughout my SNAP Challenge, I kept returning to the same questions: What kind of society do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country that turns a cold shoulder to the problem of hunger, or one in which we work together to face it head on? We, in corporate America, must be part of the solution. At Panera, we have tried to stretch ourselves to think of how to address hunger in new ways and challenge others to do the same. We have developed five nonprofit ""Panera Cares"" community cafes with no set prices and have donated hundreds of millions of dollars in products to food banks. Our view is that unless we at Panera take care of the world that we live in, there won't be any society left to support us. If the past week has taught me anything, it's that hunger is not a problem of ""them,"" it's a problem of ""us."" Hunger exists in every community, in every county, in every state. Simply put, this is our problem to solve, and it's time to do so. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ron Shaich.","Panera Bread CEO Ron Shaich lived on the amount a food stamp recipient gets each day .

"Bangalore, India (CNN) -- Nineteen-year-old Reshma Banu sits on the stairs outside her parents' home, staring at the tiny screen on her cell phone. The video on the screen has her mesmerized: a very short home video of her baby girl, Afreen. The moments captured are precious because they show Banu's only child alive and well. Afreen died in the hospital. She was three months old. Authorities say the baby was admitted to the hospital with bite marks, cigarette burns and a dislocated neck. Police say she was killed by her father. ""After my delivery my husband had come to see me and the baby. He said, 'It is a girl, why did you give birth to a girl?'"" He wanted a boy, an heir. Girls were too expensive, he said. A couple of days after giving birth, Banu says her husband gave an ultimatum. ""For her wedding we will require a hundred thousand rupees (about US$1,800 dollars) for all the expense. If you can get that amount from your mother, then keep her, but if you can't, then kill her,"" Banu recalled her husband as saying. She didn't believe he meant it and was sure he would change his mind once he held his soft, bright-eyed baby girl. Three months later, her baby is dead, and her husband is under arrest, accused of beating the baby to death. Police say he confessed to the killing. This is by no means the first case of its kind in India. Attitudes, traditions, and economics have come together to make being a girl a dangerous prospect in the country, doctors say. Most of the time girls are disposed of long before they are born. How? Sex-selective abortions. U.S. House of Representatives rejects abortion ban based on sex of fetus . India has a growing gender gap: The 2011 census showed that for every 1,000 boys six years or younger there were only 914 girls. It is the lowest child sex ratio since India's independence in 1947. The United Nations has said India is the most dangerous place to be a girl. Dr. Anand Krishnan at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), who has studied the gender gap for years, agrees. ""Yes, largely this is from the point of view of mortality statistics for girls versus boys,"" Krishnan told CNN. Sex-selective abortions are against the law in India but are still happening at an alarming rate, he said. His study shows a surprising trend: Sex selective abortions among the educated and well-off seem to be more prevalent than among the desperately poor and uneducated. Despite greater prosperity, their mindsets have not changed and they have the money to pay for ultrasounds and abortions. ""A boy is seen as a better investment. They prefer boys,"" Krishnan said. The explanation goes something like this: In traditional Indian families the men marry and bring their bride home to live and take care of his parents. Girls, on the other hand, marry and leave the home without providing extra financial support. Moreover, a girl's family can go broke trying to pay a dowry to get her married. Although outlawed in India, dowries are still common and take different forms throughout society. Indian law also forbids doctors to tell a couple the sex of their child after an ultrasound, but many clinics break the law and do so anyway. India has made an effort across the country to stop female infanticide. CNN visited a village in Haryana state with one of the worst ratios of boys to girls, according to the Indian government. A campaign is under way to change villagers' minds about girls. Tiny placards above the doors of several homes say in Hindi: ""If you get rid of your girls, where will you find your daughter-in-laws?"" A teenage boy wore a T-shirt that said, ""Save our girls."" Nonetheless, there were young boys everywhere and only a few young girls. Villagers only affirmed why there appeared to be an imbalance. ""Girls are mostly aborted here. The people want more boys. There is a shortage of girls,"" Chandravati said without hesitation. The villager was taking care of her neighbor's newborn baby girl. She cooed at the baby while blowing cigarette smoke into its tiny little face, oblivious to the dangers second-hand smoke could pose. She told us the poorest people don't have the money to abort, so they are forced to keep girls, but those who can afford an ultrasound and abortion get rid of female fetuses. ""So much money is required to get them married. Where will the money come from?"" she said. ""Everything is so expensive these days."" But India is a country filled with in-your-face contradictions. When it comes to women and girls it is a place where the discarding of girls is juxtaposed with the fact that India has a female president and speaker of the House -- and its most powerful politician is a woman, Sonia Gandhi. Indira Gandhi, Sonia's mother-in-law, became India's first woman prime minister and one of the world's first female heads of government. In 2011 the latest census data showed the literacy rate for girls is growing faster than for boys. Banu, whose husband is accused of killing their baby, and her parents say they always believed a baby -- boy or girl -- was a blessing. Her mother, Maqbool Bi, had four girls and a boy. Though the family is poor, she raised her girls with great hope for their futures. ""With all that is there in my heart, my heart breaks every time I recall what happened [to my granddaughter]. Even when I was starving I raised my children, all four of them. I used to pray to God to save me from seeing any of my children die before my own eyes. My children should succeed in life. They should make us proud,"" she said. Banu now lives with her parents in a tiny two-room home filled to a bursting point with family members. She will spend her life struggling with the fact that she never got the chance to raise her first child because the baby was born a girl. With tears welling in her eyes, Banu said, ""She had just come into the world. She was like a flower bud, and he killed her. I lost my daughter. What can be worse than this?"" Is tide turning against killing of infants in Ethiopia? CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Indian man is accused of killing 3-month-old baby girl because he wanted a son .

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- If you grew up in India, chances are you played kabaddi as a child. I did. My friends did. Bollywood actor and now professional kabaddi league team owner, Abhishek Bachchan says he did too. So when you talk about kabaddi, there's a whiff of nostalgia associated with the sport. As children, we played kabaddi in the garden. You don't need any equipment. We just drew two lines in the mud, that's it. What you need is strength and stamina... and you should be able to hold your breath for at least 30 seconds. What is kabaddi? Kabaddi is one of India's oldest indigenous sports. It's basically a mix of school-yard tag and wrestling. You have two teams of seven players who stand on either side of a line. Each team sends a ""raider"" across to the other side, one by one. The raider must tag as many opponents as he can and rush back to his side before the defenders catch him. Sounds simple? It is, though there is a twist: the raider must hold his breath the entire time he's trying to tag someone and keep chanting ""kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi"" to prove he's not taking another breath. ""Here is a sport which is a mixture of rugby, wrestling and it's got the strategy of chess. It's fantastic,"" says Bachchan. Unfortunately, kabaddi faded away over the years. It was still played, but predominantly in rural areas. In urban India, it lost out to other sports like cricket and to a lesser extent, football, which are televised and so very easy to watch. ""We have become this one sport nation,"" says well-known Indian sports commentator Charu Sharma. ""It's a bit of a monster. Cricket has had a huge head start in terms of visibility on TV, which is a big deal in sport. Most sports are only as popular as their live TV coverage, so that is what is required."" TV rebirth . But now kabaddi is finally getting it. Sharma has teamed up with Indian business tycoon Anand Mahindra to launch India's first pro kabaddi league, based along the lines of Indian cricket's successful Indian Premier League (IPL). There are eight franchises owned by corporate czars and Bollywood stars, and matches are played indoors on a large mat. In another huge boost for kabaddi, major broadcaster Star Sports decided to screen these matches live every night on prime time television. ""The network felt the need to foster a multi-sport culture in India,"" says Uday Shankar, CEO of Star India. It's a gamble. Will audiences tune in to watch a sport that India has ignored for years? It seems they're intrigued. Star Sports says the inaugural game -- played in a stadium packed with celebrities, smoke machines and loud music -- was watched by 66 million viewers across the country. That's 10 times higher than the Indian figures for the FIFA World Cup opening match between Brazil and Croatia. ""Everybody thinks of kabaddi as a very rural, basic, aggressive sport, you play on the grass or in the mud, but when you see international kabaddi today, its exhilarating,"" says Bachchan. Rakesh Kumar, one of India's most celebrated kabaddi players says he can't believe his sport is enjoying such a resurgence. ""In my dreams I never thought I'd see a day like this.""

"(CNN) -- Privacy is vital to my sense of self. It is as important as breathing; each breath may be my last. So I am acutely aware of how difficult it must have been for Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, the world's richest company, to sacrifice his privacy and expose himself to public scrutiny in an essentially homophobic world. The fact that a CEO of a fortune 500 company's decision to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality made international news on the same scale as Ebola exposes the persistence of homophobia and hetero-sexism in the West -- despite the existence of laws to protect LGBT people in the USA and elsewhere. Coming out as LGBT is not an easy thing to do anywhere in the world, even if you are the head of a global company such as Apple. The fallout from such an act is unpredictable, potentially catastrophic and game changing -- and that's when you're coming out in a society where there is legislation to protect LGBT people. The international newsworthiness of Cook's decision is a reminder of the gulf between legislation and social emotions. As I read Cook's courageous story, I couldn't help but wonder what it would mean for a Nigerian CEO to follow his example now, in the context of Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act which challenges the rights of all LGBT people. While I was not surprised by the news about Cook (though not because I had any prior information about his sexuality), I did wonder why he had decided to trade in his privacy. I also wondered what price he will pay for coming out and what price he may have paid for keeping his sexuality a secret? What closet has he now opened and what closet will now be forever closed as a result of his coming out? As these questions played on my mind, I could not help but be thankful that such a figure would acknowledge his sexuality in the way that he has done, especially at a time when countries like Nigeria are effectively criminalizing gay people, with a law banning homosexuality. Will those homophobic legislators and their fellow promoters of hate now stop using their ""gay"" Western technologies? Some homophobes are already claiming that since Apple was co-founded by the straight Steve Jobs, the fact that Tim Cook is gay will ""corrupt"" the brand. I wonder how many Nigerian or African CEOs are now thinking about acknowledging their homosexuality, even if only to themselves as a result of Cook's declaration. Because coming out is not always about making a public announcement to the rest of the world -- it can just be about being honest with oneself or with those who you truly value in your life -- those who have supported you, but who are unaware of the totality of who you are because of the closet which society has forced so many LGBT people into in Africa. If we look at Cook's trajectory we can see he has always been ""out"" to those who matter to him, those who supported his growth and those who probably gave him the courage to make his statement last week. His decision will mean different things to different people across the world -- it may have more resonance for LGBT people in the U.S. and in the West because of proximity, but his declaration also provides a counter-narrative to American far-right evangelists and agents of homophobia in Africa. Cook's announcement is both a provocation and a reminder that clothes, not human beings, belong in the closet. It is a call to action for those in positions of power to come out and be counted: By letting go of their own privacy in order to give courage to millions, the likes of Cook are using their privileged position to insist on justice, equality and the right for all of humanity to be recognized and respected. Who knows, Cook's decision to publicly acknowledge that he is gay may be the impetus some of our closeted CEOs need. At present, it may well be career-destroying for a Nigerian or African CEO to come out in the way Cook has done, but they may be inspired to work behind the scenes, to change policies in their organizations, to work quietly with African governments to reverse the homophobic laws or even to support and commit their Corporate and Social Responsibility budget to CSOs working on sexual minority rights in the country without drawing attention to their own sexuality. For me, in Nigeria, someone like Cook revealing his sexuality is his own way of aligning his personal identity and privilege with the struggle against the tyranny of the heterosexual majority and the modern pogrom against LGBT people, especially in Africa. Cook represents all that we as LGBT activists dream of: To have powerful figures use their position to bring visibility to LGBT existence. While one individual making a public declaration won't automatically result in a change of policies or laws, each one puts a face to the conversation and helps advance the discourse. Cook, like the now openly gay Kenyan writer Biniyavanga Wainanian, author of ""One day I will write about this place,"" reminds us all that LGBT people are here, have been here among us and are contributing magnificently to development. Cook's courageous action is an inspiration to us all; but Binyavanga Wainaina's revelation of his sexuality -- earlier this year he published a ""lost"" chapter from his memoir entitled ""I am a homosexual, Mum"" -- is probably more contextually powerful for us as Africans. I for one look forward to a day when a powerful and respected African CEO will publicly acknowledge that they are LGBT, or openly and unequivocally support the rights of LGBT people. For now, we'll continue to be inspired by Cook and Wainaina's courage. READ MORE: Why gay people like Tim Cook must tell their stories . READ MORE: Is Africa the most homophobic continent?

"(CNN) -- While most people can appreciate the grace and athleticism of ballet, dressage -- the precision art of horse riding and training -- remains a puzzling spectacle to all but a few. A new performance by the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) aims to show that these two art forms are not so different. For the launch of the flagship FEI World Cup Finals in Lyon, France the organizing body assembled the finest talent from the worlds of elite riding and ballet to show off their skills side by side. ""They're very similar in terms of athletic ability; they're very delicate but they're very powerful,"" said U.S. Jumping rider Charlie Jacobs, who joined dressage champion Charlotte Dujardin and dancers from the Minsk Bolshoi for the photoshoot. Double Olympic gold medalist Charlotte Dujardin was just as impressed with her partnership with Belarusian maestro Kanstantsin Geronik -- calling it an ""exciting"" prelude to the competition in which she once again shattered world records. The FEI's Director of Dressage, Trond Asmyr, says the organizers hoped to create a comparison to ballet which would open up the esoteric world to outsiders. He believes the parallels go beyond the athletes' physical abilities. ""You see a number of different elements in there. You need strength. You need power. You need elegance,"" he said. ""You need a feeling for what you're doing: it's not only a question of jumping as far as you can or as long as you can or as high as you can -- it's this combination of putting all these elements together to produce the optimal performance."" He was pleased with how much the riders got out of the day. He called Dujardin ""a full-blown artist herself"" but says seeing her perform alongside Geronik highlighted the virtuosos' similarities. The real test, he says, is to close your eyes and listen to the music. In either sport, you can imagine how the performer (or performer plus horse) could glide across the space. Dujardin, the World number one Dressage rider, who took the dressage crown in Lyon, has been labeled ""the girl with the dancing horse,"" but was enthused to see her horse-less dancing counterparts in action. The evening after the photoshoot, organizers FEI took the riders to see the dancers on their own turf -- at the Lyon Amphitheatre where the Bolshoi performed Swan Lake as part of a nationwide French tour. Asmyr says Dujardin told him she saw dance with ""new eyes."" He now has high hopes for developing the cross-cultural collaboration further in future. ""Ballet is certainly more well known around the world than dressage riding, so if we can facilitate an understanding from people about our sport, through the similarities with ballet, then we're very happy about that.""

"(CNN) -- On Friday, October 17, Alex Badeh, Nigeria's most senior military official, announced in the Nigerian capital Abuja that ""a ceasefire agreement has been concluded"" with the terrorist group Boko Haram. ""I have accordingly directed the [military] chiefs to ensure immediate compliance with this development in the field,"" he said. More than one government official followed up with claims that the release of the more than 200 schoolgirls abducted in April was one of the concessions extracted from the terrorist group as part of the truce. Now, more than three weeks later, there's nothing to suggest that Boko Haram is keen on peace. A video released on November 1 shows a man believed to be sect leader Abubakar Shekau denouncing the so-called deal and vowing to continue the campaign of terror. The abducted girls, Shekau taunts, ""are in their marital homes."" The sect has also continued to attack and capture towns and villages in the north east -- including, a week ago, Air Marshal Badeh's home town. Recent history -- a long line of failed attempts to negotiate with, or pacify, Boko Haram -- should have inspired some wariness on the part of the government. In 2011, Kashim Shettima, then Governor-Elect of Borno, the state worst-hit by the violence, said his government would ""offer them amnesty as long as they lay down their arms and embrace peace."" The offer was rejected by someone who claimed to be a spokesperson for the sect, for two reasons; ""first we do not believe in the Nigerian constitution and secondly we do not believe in democracy but only in the laws of Allah."" A few months later, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo travelled to Maiduguri, where the group started out from more than a decade ago, to discuss with the family of Mohammed Yusuf, the sect's founder (whose controversial death in police custody in 2009 triggered the sect's bloody uprising). Barely 48 hours after the meeting, the man who hosted Obasanjo on behalf of the family was shot dead by unknown gunmen. In April 2013 the Federal Government set up a ""Presidential Committee on the Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Conflicts in Northern Nigeria."" Days later a man claiming to be a Boko Haram spokesperson rejected the amnesty. This was followed by a Hausa language audio recording released to journalists in which a man purporting to be sect leader Abu Shekau, said: ""We are the ones to grant them pardon. Have you forgotten their atrocities against us?"" Nonetheless, the government pushed ahead with the plan; the head of the committee announced a ceasefire in July. As 2013 came to an end, Boko Haram intensified its activities, culminating in the abduction of the schoolgirls this April. Around July this year, presumably inspired by ISIS, it started to seize -- and hold -- territory. It was against this alarming backdrop that the news of the latest ceasefire emerged, to much relief from around the world. Now that the ceasefire deal has proven to be a sham, several questions linger: What did the government do to verify the legitimacy of the Boko Haram negotiator? What was the plan regarding the swathes of Nigerian territory seized and held by Boko Haram, pre-ceasefire? And, most importantly, why did the federal government, aware of how every previous talk of a ceasefire has turned out, fail to exercise greater caution with this latest one, even in the face of valid concerns by those who should know. The answer to the last question may be found in the fact of Nigeria's brutal, winner-takes-all politics. In the general elections forthcoming early next year, President Jonathan will be seeking a second and final term. It should have been a walkover for the incumbent, as presidential elections traditionally are in these parts. But a potential game-changer emerged last year: a merger of Nigeria's leading opposition parties -- producing arguably the strongest and most determined opposition alliance a Nigerian ruling party has ever faced. Both parties have stridently sought to capitalize on the Nigeria's dire security situation in northeastern Nigeria; the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by alleging that the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) is sympathetic to Boko Haram and is sponsoring the insurgency to undermine Mr. Jonathan's government, and the APC by highlighting the success of Boko Haram as evidence of the incompetence of President Goodluck Jonathan and his government. When the news broke -- at a time when opposition presidential candidates were launching their campaigns, and when speculation was rife that the President was due to declare his own bid soon -- more than a few people saw it as a move by a beleaguered government to counter allegations of incompetence, and shore up its image. The release of the abducted girls would no doubt have boosted Mr. Jonathan's re-election chances. It seems likely that it is this obsession with the approaching elections that fueled the government's shocking gullibility in this matter; allowing it to be hoodwinked into going to town with news of a deal swathed in red flags. The fact that no room was left for doubt or caution is shocking, considering that it is open knowledge that Boko Haram, far from possessing a unified command, is actually a chain of factions varying widely in motivation and method, presumably ""too fragmented to present a common front for dialogue."" The government's blindness -- willful or otherwise -- to that fact should alarm us all. But it's not very surprising. At every turn the Nigerian government -- everything from the president's office, to the military, and intelligence services -- has demonstrated that it is as confused as the rest of us. We see this not just in the desperation, at the highest levels, to believe anything regardless of how implausible it sounds, but also in the supremely careless manner in which information regarding the crisis continues to be managed. If the past is anything to go by, I'm certain we haven't seen the last of the ""ceasefire"" announcements.","On October 17, Nigeria's government announced a truce with Boko Haram .

"London (CNN) -- After the grand slams, it's the most prestigious men's tournament on the tennis tour. The World Tour Finals start Sunday in London and feature eight of the globe's top players including two-time defending champion Novak Djokovic, six-time winner Roger Federer and Britain's Andy Murray. Apart from those familiar names, three debutants line up at the O2 Arena -- a venue that normally hosts some of the world's top musicians -- in Marin Cilic, Kei Nishikori and Milos Raonic. One player who won't be there, however, is Rafael Nadal -- the Spaniard underwent appendix surgery this week. The show goes on without Nadal and here's a closer look at the combatants who'll vie for a potential prize of roughly $2 million. Group A . Novak Djokovic . Rank: 1 . Age: 27 . Tournament history: Eighth straight appearance, two-time defending champion . Djokovic won another grand slam title at Wimbledon, but 2014 hasn't been all good for the Serb. He suffered upset losses to Stan Wawrinka and Nishikori at the Australian Open and U.S. Open, respectively. With archrival Nadal absent at Flushing Meadows due to a wrist injury, ""Nole"" missed a huge chance to collect major No. 8. Off the court, however, there was much happiness: Djokovic got married in July and became a new dad last month. As the champion in 2012 and 2013 and having won 27 consecutive indoor matches, Djokovic begins the tournament as favorite. Stan Wawrinka . Rank: 4 . Age: 29 . Tournament history: Second straight appearance . From the middle of 2005 to the end of last year, only one player outside the ""Big Four"" managed to win a grand slam title -- Juan Martin del Potro at the 2009 U.S. Open. Wawrinka loosened the grip of the all-conquering quartet, though, when he toppled both Djokovic and Nadal at the Australian Open. He did get a bit of luck, mind you, as a back injury hampered Nadal in the final. Weighed down by being in the spotlight and heightened expectations, Federer's countryman has failed to maintain his lofty January level. He's lost four of his last five matches. Tomas Berdych . Rank: 7 . Age: 29 . Tournament history: Fifth straight appearance . Berdych is popular on social media for his humor and has made waves with his attire at grand slams, particularly his shirt at the Australian Open that resembled Argentina's football jersey and his flowery offering at Roland Garros. It was another solid season for the Czech with the racquet in his hand. He achieved the quarterfinals or better at three grand slams and collected a landmark 10th career title. Yet there's still no grand slam title for the ever dangerous Berdych, and he hasn't hidden his desire to hire Ivan Lendl as coach. Marin Cilic . Rank: 9 . Age: 26 . Tournament history: Debut . Not even Cilic could have imagined his reversal of fortune. He served a doping ban -- later shortened -- that forced him to skip the U.S. Open last year but 12 months later Cilic powered his way to the crown, easing past Berdych, Federer and Nishikori with the help of his potent serve. The opening months of 2014 weren't shabby for Cilic, either, as he went 16-1 during one stretch. He has credited his high-profile coach, Goran Ivanisevic, for boosting his serve -- and belief. Group B . Roger Federer . Rank: 2 . Age: 33 . Tournament history: 13th straight appearance, six-time champion . It's been a fine campaign for Federer, the Swiss who often leads the conversation when discussing the greatest tennis players of all time. Hindered by a bad back in 2013, he finished last season at No. 6. But now he stands at No. 2 and even has an opportunity to eclipse Djokovic -- his ouster in the Wimbledon final -- as the year-end No. 1. Will, though, Federer be distracted at the World Tour Finals? Switzerland meets France in the Davis Cup final -- the team competition and Olympic singles gold are the lone two massive titles he hasn't won in his record-breaking career -- later in November. Further, Federer landed in the tougher group. Kei Nishikori . Rank: 5 . Age: 24 . Tournament history: Debut . When Nishikori retired against Nadal in the final of the clay-court Madrid Masters in May with a back injury, one couldn't help but think the flashy Japanese would be slowed by yet more injury problems -- especially when he fell in the first round of the French Open weeks later. Nishikori then didn't play in the two most important U.S. Open warm-up events because of toe troubles. But in that instance he recovered, eliminating Djokovic and Wawrinka in New York en route to becoming the first Asian man to compete in a grand slam singles final. He capped a fabulous four weeks by triumphing in front of his adoring public in Tokyo. Andy Murray . Rank: 6 . Age: 27 . Tournament history: Sixth appearance . Murray didn't surface at the year-end championships in 2013 as he continued to rehabilitate his back -- and he had to work extremely hard to make sure he locked down a berth this year, playing for six straight weeks down the stretch. If last year was Murray's high-water mark -- winning Wimbledon to end a 77-year wait for a British men's singles champion -- this year as a whole hasn't been as prosperous. The influential Lendl left his team, Murray struggled to find his best form following the back operation and his tweet about Scottish independence attracted criticism. Will all of the crowd be behind Murray, then? Milos Raonic . Rank: 8 . Age: 23 . Tournament history: Debut . If Nishikori is Japan's trailblazer on the men's side, Raonic is Canada's equivalent. Whereas Nishikori defeated Raonic at the U.S. Open, the latter upended his slightly older rival on the way to a semifinal showing at Wimbledon. It came about a month after Raonic made a maiden grand slam quarterfinal at Roland Garros. He'll no doubt be confident, since Raonic beat Federer at last week's Paris Masters and subsequently made the final. Though he has made strides from the baseline and in his return game, the serve remains the overwhelming weapon. Raonic passed 1,000 aces for the second time in three seasons.","The ATP World Tour Finals start Sunday and feature eight of the best players on the tour .

"(CNN) -- In footballing terms, Landon Donovan isn't a marquee name in Europe. He endured a miserable stint at behemoth Bayern Munich and only when he played in a less pressurized environment on another loan deal -- for Everton in the English Premier League -- did he excel. On the domestic front, it's an entirely different matter. Donovan can rightly claim to being the talisman for the national team for the past decade or so, featuring in three World Cups and holding the distinction of scoring more goals than anyone else for the U.S. He was, unquestionably, the leading figure as the U.S. transitioned from football minnow to respected outfit. If his omission from the World Cup squad by manager Jurgen Klinsmann couldn't be compared to, let's say, a Lionel Messi being snubbed by Argentina or a Cristiano Ronaldo being dropped by Portugal, it's not far off. ""It is a very tight race for those spots,"" Klinsmann, hired in 2011 and last year given an extension until 2018, told reporters in May. ""We feel like the other players, without naming any of those guys, are a tiny bit ahead of him. ""That's why we made that decision, which is obviously and understandably the biggest topic out there."" Most in the U.S.'s growing footballing community have disagreed with the man who ""shockingly"" left out Donovan -- that was the word used by the 32-year-old's MLS team, the L.A. Galaxy -- but Germany's Klinsmann tends to court controversy, or at least divide opinion. Here's someone who, for all his scoring prowess during his playing days, will be forever linked with diving. Pedro Monzon's challenge on 'Klinsy' in the 1990 World Cup final was reckless but the latter's exaggerated air time could be compared to a high-jumper performing a forward roll. For good measure, when he hit the ground, Klinsmann resembled a fish when first out of the water -- flopping from the shock. Monzon became the first player sent off in a World Cup final and Argentina's fate was sealed. Fast forward to his time as Germany manager. There can be few more uplifting scenarios than an adored former player guiding a national team to World Cup glory on home soil -- Klinsmann made 80 international appearances, netting 38 times -- and the Germans indeed almost prevailed in 2006, falling to bogey side and eventual champion Italy in the semifinals. But current Germany captain Philipp Lahm all but wrote in his autobiography that Klinsmann didn't play much of a role, saying he was tactically deficient. Instead he praised then assistant Joachim Low (who just happens to be Lahm's current boss with Germany). Lahm lined up, too, under Klinsmann at Bayern Munich in 2008/2009, when Klinsmann didn't last the season. Klinsmann and Lahm will meet again, since Germany -- as well as Portugal and Ghana -- landed in the U.S.'s group. ""There was very little technical instruction and the players had to get together independently before the game to discuss how we wanted to play,"" Lahm wrote. Klinsmann's deep focus on fitness and nutrition, and fondness for yoga, is well known. Players have even been given aptitude tests, not their usual fare. ""I don't know if I'd like his rules,"" U.S. international keeper Marcus Hahnemann, not making the trip to Brazil, told CNN. ""I'm way more laid back than most are. ""I would maybe struggle but that's the way he wants to run it."" Judging by a story in the Sporting News last year, Hahnemann has company in not being entirely convinced by Klinsmann's methods. Speaking anonymously, people linked with the U.S. team opened up about Klinsmann's apparent tactical naivety, and the author stated there was ""building resentment over the perceived importance and attitude of the German-born players."" Although it's not strange for players born in one country to represent another -- in-demand striker Diego Costa picked Spain over Brazil for the World Cup -- Klinsmann selected more than merely one: Jermaine Jones, John Brooks, Timothy Chandler and Fabian Johnson were all born in Germany. Bayern Munich's Julian Green, meanwhile, mostly represented Germany under the senior level. ""Jurgen has made it clear that looking at all possible options for discovering players will be exhausted,"" Tony Meola, who earned a century of caps for the U.S., told CNN. ""My biggest concern is always, 'Are you playing for the love of the jersey and what it represents?' ""If the answer is an emphatic, 'Yes,' I have no problem with it but anything less, I would be concerned. ""We are in a different era and one that is changing the face of the game."" Klinsmann's brutal assessment of his charges' chances at the World Cup -- ""I think for us now, talking about winning a World is just not realistic"" -- also didn't go down well in the court of American public opinion. With all the second guessing, you might be hard pressed to believe that the U.S. has made inroads under Klinsmann, who has lived in California for more than 15 years and is married to an American. But how else to describe the U.S. beating powerhouse Italy for the first time -- in Italy -- and overcoming arch-rival Mexico in Mexico, also a first? Note that Donovan played a combined 45 minutes in those landmark successes. Klinsmann hasn't shied away from pushing for friendlies against top sides and has attempted to make the U.S. play a more proactive brand of football, rather than defend and counter. Klinsmann hasn't been the lone manager targeted by the outspoken Lahm -- he came down harshly on the new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal -- and Hahnemann admits the U.S. has ""definitely made progress."" ""In terms of the tactics, he has certainly tried to change the way we play,"" added defender Jonathan Spector, who featured against the Italians. ""We have the players for it, and I think it's just going to take some time to adjust to that. ""You can't argue with the results we've had. He's been very successful as a national team coach, both with Germany and with the US. ""In terms of sports science and that, I think there's a place for that in football and he's a very personable man. He's easy to talk to."" So, Klinsmann has his supporters and detractors. Results in Brazil are sure to sway opinion further. Donovan snub sparks outrage . Brazil 2014 World Cup: Score updates and schedule of matches .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes the price of success is losing the thing you most cherish. For Charlotte Dujardin, every triumph in the sporting arena seemingly took her another step closer to an uncertain future. Billed as ""The Girl with the Dancing Horse"" after her heroics at the London 2012 Olympics, she feared that every time she competed would be the last waltz with her equine partner. The mere thought of losing her ""best friend"" reduced Dujardin to tears. Valegro, the horse on which she won double gold, on which she was crowned double European champion and on which she aims to repeat the feat at August's world championships, was attracting big offers. He was valued at $10 million but, after much speculation, Valegro's ""For Sale"" sign has finally come down -- meaning they now have the chance to continue a remarkable record-setting run together. ""His future is secure -- he is never going to be sold, we have him forever,"" the British rider says of the 12-year-old horse, which is co-owned by her mentor and fellow Olympic champion Carl Hester and Roly Luard. ""It's an unbelievable relief. It was really, really hard knowing that every competition we did might be our last one. I never knew what was going on, I was too afraid to ask,"" Dujardin tells CNN. Hester, who won team dressage gold alongside Dujardin at London 2012, hopes to set up a small syndicate to cover the costs of keeping Valegro in competition. ""There will be others I can sell on but this one is special,"" the 46-year-old told Horse and Country earlier this year. ""I didn't want Charlotte to feel like he might be sold -- it's not great to ride under those conditions. Besides, Valegro has been with us since he was two so whoever we sell him to, are they going to look after him the way we do? Probably not."" Dujardin describes Valegro -- more affectionately known as Blueberry at his yard -- as a Ferrari and, to all intents and purposes, she is a Fernando Alonso as she wrestles the ultimate horsepower out of him. ""He's a real hot horse who likes to work, and he's just the most willing and comfortable horse to ride,"" she says of their ""telepathic"" partnership. ""He trusts me implicitly, we both have that trust for each other. ""As for me, I just do what I do. I just have a feeling inside me and I can't wholly explain that feeling."" Dujardin is the world No. 1 in dressage, which is split into two events (the set routine and the freestyle) and holds the world records in all three elements of her sport -- the freestyle, Grand Prix and Grand Prix Special. Her most recent record came at last month's Reem Acra FEI World Cup Final in Lyon with a score of 87.129% comfortably beating her previous milestone of 85.942 set at the European Championships. She scored 92.179% in the freestyle section. Surely there is a ceiling to the records? ""Well, you'd think that but he just gets better every time,"" Dujardin says. ""I don't know what the limit is although I do believe we can at least beat the freestyle record. There still feels like there's more to come."" Dujardin is somewhat disbelieving at the success that she has achieved. It is true that she hasn't gone down the typical route. She did not have the privileged upbringing of many of her rivals. Born in Enfield, north London, she only got her chance when her grandmother Joy died, leaving a five-figure inheritance to give Dujardin her the chance to buy her first horse of note. ""It's odd when I look back, I have to pinch myself sometimes, I honestly can't believe it,"" she says. ""I've done more than I ever dreamed of. I've just worked hard to get to the top. I've had so many letters from people saying I've inspired them to take up riding and that's an amazing feeling. ""Getting to the top is one thing but staying there is quite another. That's the difficult bit."" Dujardin will take a trip down memory lane on Friday when competing at the Royal Windsor Horse Show, one of the first events that she ever competed in as a child and a chance to display her and Valegro's finery on home soil once more. Her biggest home display will forever be the London 2012 Olympics. The British team had entered it looking for a first Olympic medal in the discipline in over a century, and she ended up picking up two golds) in the space of just a week. But she admits: ""Life after London was tough. The whole experience was incredible. I'd just aimed to be there so that was it, I'd achieved my goal. To get those gold medals was just an unbelievable bonus. ""But after that died down I almost felt a bit depressed -- understandable after such a high. It was difficult coming from doing so little media to suddenly being in the media spotlight. ""People wanted me to do everything, and I found that really, really tough. It was a very difficult time. ""Part of that was down to the uncertainty of not knowing Valegro's future but obviously that's all changed."" Throughout it all, the pair kept on winning and breaking records, but the complete happiness has fully returned in 2014. In addition, the Olympics has brought her all manner of other unlikely facets to her life, ranging from a friendship with chart-topping singer Leona Lewis, who has come to see her train and compete, to passing on tips to former England footballer Michael Owen on dressage for his daughter, who also rides. None of that has fazed Dujardin, who still bears the same trademark smile that delighted the crowds in London and has made her something of a smiling assassin in which she has decimated her rivals in competition. Just the world title now is left on the to-do list. Should she win that, she says: ""I will have achieved everything in my career at the age of 28. It'll be time to retire!"" But there are no retirement plans. She and Valegro have plenty of competitions ahead of them. But she is relishing their new lease of life together. ""I know I'll never have another Valegro and this is probably the peak of my career,"" Dujardin says. ""But who cares? There are thousands of people that would like to have had this opportunity. I've been lucky to have it, I will always have it and I will enjoy it."" It is a far cry from the rider that first turned up at the yard of Hester, himself an Olympic champion who described her as Edwina Scissorhands, because of her wooden riding skills akin to the character played by Johnny Depp in the 1990 movie Edward Scissorhands. Hers and Hester's relationship can still be a volatile one -- Dujardin admitting ""we occasionally scream and shout at each other"" -- but it is clearly stronger for the certainty over Valegro's future. Dujardin knows she can save the pair's last dance for some time.","Charlotte Dujardin rode to double dressage gold at the London Olympics on Valegro .
But the fear was the partnership would be separated with Valegro up for sale .
The partnership is now safe and the pair have gone on to break world records .
Dujardin now has the world title in her sights, the one major success missing from her CV ."

"(CNN) -- Serbia hosted the Third Meeting of Heads of Government of China and Central and Eastern Europe this week, marking the first visit of a Chinese Premiere to Belgrade in 28 years. The Balkan nation has positioned itself as an attractive destination for Chinese investment over the last decade, with a number of big projects in the pipeline. One of them is the China-funded Zemun-Borca bridge over the Danube river which was ceremonially opened by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Serbian prime minister Aleksandar Vucic Thursday. Serbia is increasingly looking to invest in big infrastructure projects in Southeast Europe in order to ease the passage of its goods from the Greek port of Piraeus, which is under a 35-year concession by Chinese shipping giant Cosco, to western Europe. CNN's Paula Newton sat down with Vucic in Belgrade ahead of the summit to discuss the government's efforts against corruption, Serbia's strategy for EU membership and the Kosovo issue. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: Strategically, why is it so important at this point in time to be having this summit and to invite so many different countries? Aleksandar Vucic: It is actually the third summit in a row that is taking place here in Belgrade and we are very satisfied because of that fact. I'm really jubilant to see 16 prime ministers in our country, in Belgrade. It means that Belgrade once again became a very open, connected city. Many people from all over the world would associate Serbia with some past times, with the wars, and some terrible times not only for Serbia but for the whole region. I dare to say today that Serbia is renewing its energy, Serbia is once again a very open society and a very open place for all our guests. CNN: What is China getting out of it? Some wonder if they will have undue influence in this country, because of the strong economic ties? AV: They get our money. It's capitalism; they invest something, they earn money and that's it -- it's a market economy. CNN: You're all in competition, I would say, in these European countries for that Chinese investment .Do you think there's enough around to go for everyone, or do you feel that it is a competitive environment right now? AV: We do our best. Of course there is competition, that's something very normal between countries and Serbia is not afraid of competition. From Serbia you have a very open market of one billion people, which means that we have free trade agreements with the European Union, and on the other hand we have free trade agreements with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, as well as Turkey. We also have a very good relationship with many Asian countries, including China and Japan, and I think we still have many ties in the non-alignment movement. As former Yugoslavia, we were founders of the non-alignment movement and I think that many investors should come to Serbia to use our unique position. Also, we have very competitive labor costs, very high-skilled labor, and very educated and knowledgeable people. CNN: One of those important reforms is your anti-corruption pledge. What is the situation now? AV: There is no problem with political will. There are no protected persons, there are no protected tycoons, protected politicians. The problem is that we still have an old system where people can work on each case for years, not to say for decades... and that's something that will have to change. CNN: Turning to EU membership, is 2020 the year that you'll be able to fulfill all of Serbia's requirements to gain membership? AV: If you ask me whether I do hope for my country to become a new member state, yes I do. But it's not something that I would like to promise to my people to gain some more political points and then not to deliver. What we can promise to our people is our deliverance -- to finish all the needed reforms to create a sustainable and great business environment in this country, a very good investment climate... that will have a growth rate in 2016 and 2017 that we will be able to boast with. CNN: I want to ask you, will you categorically recognize Kosovo without any caveats, if that's the condition for EU membership? AV: I've never heard of that condition. To say you have to recognize Kosovo as an independent state... would be the kind of condition that would be saying or conveying a message to Serbia, ""OK, we do not expect you in the European Union very soon.""","Serbia hosted the Third Meeting of Heads of Government of China and Central and Eastern Europe this week .

"(CNN) -- Olympic chiefs have pledged to arrest fears that sailors and windsurfers at the next Games will not just have to deal with their rivals on the water but a potential super-bug under it. Researchers have found a bacteria more typically encountered in hospital waste which produces the enzyme KPC in several different locations along the Carioca River, which feeds Guanabara Bay where the sailing events will take place. The bacteria is resistant to antibiotics and can cause urinary, gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections although Rio officials are adamant the risk is ""minimal."" But the International Olympic Committee insisted it had been made aware of the problem and was working closely with Rio officials to minimize any potential risks. The IOC statement, sent to CNN, read: ""The health and safety of the athletes is our number one priority. Rio has created a task force to monitor this situation and we are being kept fully updated by them. ""We will continue to work with Rio to ensure that the athletes are able to compete safely and in the best conditions possible."" The research is the work of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, considered one of the world's main public health research institutions. Study coordinator Ana Paula D'Alincourt Carvalho Assef, of the foundation, said in an email to the Associated Press: ""There is a risk of contracting diseases, which are not more serious than those caused by other microorganisms. The problem is that in case of infection, it is possible that treatment involves hospitalization. ""Since the super-bacteria are resistant to most modern medications, doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the organism."" Earlier this year, biologist Mario Moscatelli described the Marina Gloria, which will serve as a base for the sailing competitions, as a ""toilet."" While Rio mayor Eduardo Paes admits a planned clean-up will not be completed prior to the Games, state officials have allayed fears over the risk to sailing competitors that take to the water. In a lengthy statement from the State Environmental Institute, forwarded to CNN, it said: ""According to the president of the institute (State Environmental Institute) Isaura Frega the bacterium is not very resistant in the environment, especially in salt water. ""There's no need to panic. The possibility of discovering this bacteria in our beaches is minimal, almost non-existent -- assured Isaura Frega, highlighting that there are no records of people -- contaminated with the bacteria outside of the hospital environment -- being admitted to Rio de Janeiro's public hospitals. ""KPC is a bacteria which loses its potency when it comes into contact with salt water. It's not an aggressive bacteria. It's only resistant to antibiotics. It only represents a risk to those people who have a weak immune system -- explained the specialist."" As for Rio 2016 organizers, they have been in contact both with the government and also the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. A spokesman for Rio 2016 told CNN: ""We were alerted to a possible presence of KPC-type bacteria in some parts of the Carioca River. Rio 2016 created a task force regarding this matter. ""The group will continue to monitor the matter very closely and discuss with the government and with specialists the solutions to prevent contamination of the water and continue to guarantee the safety of athletes. This issue does not impose any change in our planning for the test events and competition events.""","Researchers find an antibiotic-resistant super-bacteria in the sailing waters for the Olympics .
Rio officials insist the risk to sailors will be ""minimal"" despite the research .
Sailors have already complained less than two years out from the Games for its filthy waters .
70% of the city's sewage is spilled into the bay where the Games sailing will take place ."

"(CNN) -- My neighbor recently discovered a four-digit passcode that unlocks the front doors to our apartment building. He shared the code with me, as well as with his girlfriend, buddies and a few other neighbors. I shared it with some people, and so did others. Within a few weeks, the building's security system was buzzing constantly for people who didn't actually have one of the dozen or so physical keys given to tenants. My apartment building's security is not all that different from the password-protected login system that forms a chain-link fence around Facebook, Google, iTunes or any other Internet service. Passwords are often shared among family, friends and spouses, and people typically use the same passwords for everything. Many experts say passwords are cybersecurity's weak link. To minimize identity theft, the Obama administration is urging Internet companies to agree upon and adopt a standard, reliable identity-verification system that people can use for any website. Each person would choose one company, perhaps their e-mail service provider, to handle credentials for sensitive personal or financial information on other sites. In this hypothetical digital world, someone could buy books on Amazon.com using a Google account, while another person could sign up for a social network using a PayPal account. Because the U.S. government is involved, Americans might be able to download their tax forms by signing into, say, their Microsoft accounts. President Obama introduced the initiative in spring 2011, and development of the technology seems to be moving at the speed of Washington, not Silicon Valley. Almost a year later, there's no consensus among Web companies and government about what exactly this should look like and when we should expect to see it. Some websites have already embraced an idea similar to what is being proposed, without the government giving them a push. For example, users of TripIt, a travel organizer from Concur Technologies, can log in using their Facebook, Google or Yahoo accounts. But this typically involves small utilities piggybacking on the networks of larger companies. The biggest Internet players, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, do not play well with each other. Instead, Facebook and Google boast about how quickly they are convincing users to volunteer their personal information in setting up profiles. Apple regularly mentions how many credit cards its iTunes service has on file -- at last count, more than 225 million. People involved in the government initiative said the major players have informally expressed interest. But a Google spokesman declined to make executives available for comment for this story. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment and a PayPal spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment. These companies may view their respective platforms as a competitive advantage, said Don Thibeau, the executive chairman for the OpenID Foundation. His organization has been trying to provide a sort of universal login system that includes Google and Yahoo, but some users find the system's row of tiny buttons confusing. OpenID will launch a simplified, single-button alternative called Connect in the next few months, Thibeau said. Thibeau said he believes technology companies may eventually realize the limits of their identity silos. Similar to how people can now send text messages to friends on different cellular networks, or how a Mac user can open a Microsoft Word file, Internet login systems should one day standardize, he said. ""This notion of standards, as boring as it is, is really the plumbing of the Internet economy,"" Thibeau said. ""It turns out that you can only go so far with business and Internet services until you come up with standards. Standards build markets. Standards help the pie grow bigger."" Internet giants have not been eager to unite on their own. For various reasons, having the government involved either provides the best possibility for bringing rivals together or will poison the well, according to people involved. Companies and citizens alike can sometimes have an allergic reaction to government intervention, especially when privacy is involved. When President Obama announced last year that he was handing over the keys for an online identity initiative to the U.S. Commerce Department, talk of an ""online driver's license"" ensued. Observers say that's not an apt analogy because the identity system, as proposed, wouldn't be required for using the Web, nor would it be issued by the government. But the idea of a government-controlled database spooked many people. What Obama's proposal describes is a series of security problems on the Internet, such as insecure passwords and people handing over sensitive data to dozens of companies, as well as some vague suggestions for how to solve them. ""It's not a piece of legislation,"" said Aaron Brauer-Rieke, a fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology, an Internet privacy group in Washington. ""Instead, it's the federal government saying here is our vision of how to improve identity on the Internet."" A year ago, Jeremy Grant inherited the project. He is a senior executive for the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, and he is playing government liaison to tech companies and privacy advocates as part of the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, or NSTIC. The government's prospective standard for online identity is not expected to result in a law, as long as companies can come to an agreement among themselves. The system could be regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, said people involved in the planning. ""The way that Washington tends to affect change is to either pass a law or to pass a regulation to make something happen,"" Grant said. ""NSTIC is a bit of a policy experiment."" After failed government experiments, the United States has observed that an online ID has to be driven by companies, not countries, and has to keep Internet anonymity intact, Grant said. ""We could, on paper, come up with what would be the perfect mousetrap, and no one would want to buy it,"" Grant said. ""The federal government doesn't care if you're a dog [online] or not. Anonymity and pseudonymity have always been hallmarks of the Internet."" Bidding will begin this month on NSTIC pilot programs that should launch in the summer to demonstrate what an online identity framework could look like, Grant said. The government will carefully determine what safeguards will be implemented in the identification process and the punishments for violators, he said. Some sites could begin launching NSTIC login options in about two years, he said. Others were not so optimistic. Persuading every major Internet company and then every Web user to sign up will be a massive undertaking, said Brauer-Rieke, from the Center for Democracy and Technology. ""The work of herding cats is just beginning,"" he said. Because this is such an unusual policy experiment, the government cannot point to a similar program in the past that has been successful, said Thibeau, who is also the chairman of the Open Identity Exchange, which counts AT&T, Google, PayPal and Verizon among its members. Also, other countries may object to an initiative led by the United States, he said. What this system will look like remains undefined. People may have to type in a temporary password received via text message, answer quiz questions or identify friends in photographs, according to people involved in the initiative. NSTIC could even require a hardware dongle that users plug into their computers, though that's unlikely as people increasingly move to mobile devices that don't have standard inputs, they said. Just about everyone involved is in agreement that today's model of people picking their own passwords will not survive much longer. ""The greatest threat to security and the greatest threat to privacy are passwords,"" Thibeau said. ""Passwords are really yesterday's news.""","Obama administration is proposing a standardized login system for the Web .
People would choose Facebook, Google or another site as their provider .
The identity-verification system would then work on any website .
Because the government doesn't plan to write a law, this is a policy experiment ."

"(CNN) -- HTC is dipping its toes in the camera market with the new Re: a supersimple handheld action camera that pairs with a smartphone. The L-shaped Re camera looks like an inhaler or small periscope. Just under 4 inches high, the waterproof gadget is mostly handle. It turns on when you grip it and features a fixed ultra-wide-angle lens, a single button and no viewfinder. It captures 16 megapixel still images and shoots 1080p HD videos at 30 frames per second or 720p videos at 120 frames per second. Though it works independently, the Re does a lot more when used with its Android or iOS apps. The apps can turn a smartphone into a viewfinder and make it possible to shoot time-lapse and slow motion videos. Why is HTC, traditionally a smartphone company, making a camera? In a way, all smartphone makers are already in the camera industry. Starting with Apple's iPhone, smartphone manufacturers have mostly obliterated the point-and-shoot by putting powerful cameras in everyone's pocket. Part of the problem was that traditional pocket cameras just couldn't catch up fast enough with the editing and instant sharing features smartphones offered. HTC is approaching its camera from a different angle: It's built as a phone accessory. Though aimed at a more casual user, Re is similar to the many portable action cameras available. Led by the hugely popular GoPro, action cameras have taken off in recent years. Rugged and powerful, they can be mounted on vehicles, heads and animals for intense videos. Like GoPro, the Re will have a line of custom mounts and clips. It can shoot up to 1 meter underwater. HTC says the camera will be available before the end of the year and cost $199. It comes in white, navy and red. The Taiwanese company announced the new camera on Wednesday, along with the Desire Eye smartphone. Built to capitalize on the selfie craze, the Desire Eye puts its most powerful camera on the front side of the phone, so people can get the highest quality image of their face and make sure they look good at the same time.","HTC announces new handheld action camera .

"(CNN) -- If Sony is to continue its sales dominance in the new gaming and entertainment console market, it may be one of its most popular exclusive titles for the PlayStation 4 that does the trick. ""inFamous: Second Son"" continues the franchise's story of enhanced humans who are able to use special powers for good or for evil. This episode benefits in many ways, though, because the developer, Sucker Punch, start working with Sony early into the development cycle of the PS4 and really get a sense of how the new console would work. A new protagonist and a new city let the animators really explore areas of expression that they couldn't do with the older generation consoles. Animation director Billy Harper said the result is a real city -- Seattle -- that feels more natural than those in previous ""inFamous"" titles. ""We took the familiarity of the 'inFamous' universe. We know what makes people happy. We know what makes us grin,"" Harper told CNN. ""We decided to essentially rework everything else, because the PlayStation 4 let us."" Seattle, where Sucker Punch is based, is rendered in fine detail -- from the familiar spire of the Space Needle to shops along Puget Sound. Cut scenes and in-game dynamics work together to show how the player has already interacted with buildings or other people, and create deeper player immersion. ""We're able to get all the subtleties in the characters themselves and all the nuances of actors,"" Harper said. ""We're capturing every single thing we get on stage, which is totally insane. We avoid the 'Uncanny Valley' (digital characters that appear too lifelike) effect you usually see in most games."" John Koller, vice president of marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America, said it was important to bring in the crew from Sucker Punch before the PS4 was launched to give console builders a better idea how developers were going to use the new device. ""The PS4 was done hand in hand with development and 'inFamous' was one of those titles brought in early,"" Koller said. The result was not only an open-world game with plenty of action, but a wide-ranging story that explores the moral quandaries ingrained within the franchise's story. Do you choose the path of the hero, or flip the coin and become the villain? ""How ruthless can you be? How heroic can you be? How true can you stay to that (path) to earn the biggest reward?"" says Jennifer Dean, public relations manager for SCEA. While Koller won't call ""Second Son"" the PS4's killer app, chatter on social media and forum have shown many people are using the game as their ""excuse"" to buy the new console. However, expectations from fans and critics alike are very high. ""'inFamous' has always been my favorite Sony-exclusive franchise, and the first 'inFamous' was actually the reason I bought a PlayStation 3 a few years into its lifecycle. Everything I saw at PAX Prime 2013 made me say that I would own a PlayStation 4 prior to the launch of 'inFamous: Second Son', just because the title wowed me that much,"" explained Brian Shea, editor-in-chief of Video Game Writers. ""I expect it to deliver the same open-world superhero experience the first two retail entries brought us, but in a way that harnesses the power of the PlayStation 4."" Koller said this is just the beginning for what he calls blockbuster titles for the PS4, and explains there is a strategy to it all. With ""Destiny,"" ""Watch_Dogs,"" ""The Order: 1886,"" and ""Uncharted 4"" on the horizon, he thinks ""inFamous: Second Son"" has the initial lasting power to potentially sell more hardware. ""You buy a platform and you're actually looking not only at the game you're buying today, but the content that's coming ... because that promise is really important when you are putting down $399 for hardware,"" Koller said. Harper pointed out it was a huge benefit for Sucker Punch to hold off releasing the new title until they could do something to show off the new console's power. ""A lot of what we wanted to do was provide justification for purchasing the hardware,"" Harper said. ""In the process, it gave us so much (flexibility) to actually let people justify buying another 'inFamous' title. It is as close as you can get to buying a new IP (intellectual property) utilizing the same universe."" However, a five-month delay for a blockbuster title could have spelled potential doom as it has for other new console starts (i.e.: Nintendo's Wii U). Nintendo sales of their new console struggled in its fledgling months, mostly due to the lack of gaming titles that appealed to their audience. Shea doesn't think Sony is in any danger, and actually will benefit from the release time. ""Sony has a much better relationship with third-party developers than Nintendo does, and right now Sony just has more credibility with core gamers,"" Shea said. ""The success or failure of 'inFamous: Second Son' won't change any of those facts. That said, if 'inFamous' does click with gamers, the PlayStation 4 will be a hard console to compete with."" ""inFamous: Second Son"" is a PlayStation 4 exclusive and was released worldwide on March 21. It is rated T for Teen due to blood, drug reference, language, sexual themes, and violence.","'inFamous: Second Son' is an exclusive PlayStation 4 title .

"(CNN) -- The world of Dungeons & Dragons, the iconic role-playing game that has captivated millions since the 1970s, is more than just rolling dice on a table top. In 2014, it is computer games, books, online comics, miniature figurines and more, aimed at staying relevant in a digital age. Wizards of the Coast, the publishers of the game, is launching the latest version along with a massive campaign called Tyranny of Dragons. But on such a plethora of platforms, how is it possible to create an overarching idea that transcends platforms? The publishers say it's a simple concept known as sharing. The high adventure, in which followers of dragon queen Tiamat aim to take over the world, coincides with the release of the fifth edition of rules for tabletop version of D&D. But the company wanted to expand how players could join in the new storyline and create a community of shared experiences. ""The big part of a role-playing game is, you can do whatever you want. But we want you to end up at the same place at the end of the adventure,"" said Mike Mearls, senior manager for Dungeons & Dragons research and development. ""There are many ways to get there, but having a big event that brings everybody back together is part of the fun, because once you've gone up against Tiamat, you've got something you can talk to any fellow player about, even if you've never met that person before."" The idea of creating that shared story experience over different media meant Mearls had to think about the narrative differently. It was more about creating a story bible with direction on how various creatures behave in certain circumstances rather than plotting out each monster's actions specifically. 40 years later, 'Dungeons & Dragons' still inspiring gamers . ""Each one has a different way they act, a different goal they have,"" Mearls said. ""So when you encounter it in a (massively multiplayer online game), you can understand this creature, you can understand what it's doing, because when I'm fighting in a 3-D action environment as opposed to a board game as opposed to a role-playing game, it has a trait that can shine through."" The massively multiplayer online version, ""Neverwinter,"" will also feature the ""Tyranny of Dragons"" story. Rob Overmeyer, executive producer at Cryptic Studios, said his co-workers constantly talk with the creative teams at Wizards well in advance of any new elements in the online version. Having those discussions not only allows for swapping of ideas, it gives a cohesiveness in the look and feel of the game, he said. Overmeyer said the sharing of creative elements also frees up his team to focus more on the online-only elements of stories, finding ways to draw certain players deeper into adventures. For example, creatures that will be appearing in the new ""Monster Manual"" have been created at Wizards for its upcoming tome. Those creatures are designed by Wizards graphic artists and have been rendered in a variety of resolutions to allow them to be used in a digital game, in a book or as templates for miniature figures. The player's actions in the online campaign will be overlaid on those in the game's more traditional tabletop campaign. ""It's really about getting in there and having fun and playing D&D,"" Overmeyer said of the online game. ""If it feels like D&D, it is D&D."" The cohesiveness isn't limited to just game play. ""Table Titans"" is an online comic developed by Scott Kurtz with the blessing of Wizards of the Coast. The D&D comic spun out of Kurtz's other creation, ""PVP,"" with the introduction of a supporting character named Val. Val believes she is a dwarven fighter from ""Dungeons & Dragons"" and acts out events in her non-gaming life as if she were the character. Kurtz said his team consults with Wizards of the Coast to go over upcoming campaign materials so everything flows from a central game plan. 'Dungeons & Dragons' tries to lure back players . ""They are very good in guiding us away from what other authors are doing so we don't step on toes, and they always are wonderful with suggestions, bibles, artwork, etc,"" Kurtz said. ""But for the most part, they just sit back and watch us go. They really don't do more than say 'Here are some amazing toys; go play!' "" Kurtz said that playing D&D with his father as a child helped him in his career by creating the first characters and stories he would later transport into his comics. He's thrilled, he says, to work hand-in-hand with the people now creating the game he grew up playing. ""We promote D&D by nature of our comic being about that game, and they promote 'Table Titans' in social media and at personal events because they love the strip,"" Kurtz said. ""The business team calls that synergy, and the creatives call it 'mutual admiration.' "" Mearls said that sharing between media keeps the focus on what's always been at the heart of D&D: the story. ""It does create that community sense of shared experience, shared story, even though everyone's story experience was unique,"" he said. ""You can be whoever you want. You can do whatever you want.""","The classic ""Dungeons & Dragons"" game has new ways to play in the online age .

"(CNN) -- Since the Xbox One's release last fall, customers have been waiting (some more patiently than others) for that one great game that would single-handedly justify the purchase of the next-generation video game console. ""Titanfall,"" the first game from Respawn Entertainment, appears ready to assume the mantle. First revealed at E3 2013 in Los Angeles, ""Titanfall"" had already garnered more than 60 awards before its release last week. Now, players are getting their first shot to play as the athletic pilots of monstrously large robotic titans, stomping across highly detailed terrain in a game even the makers of the Xbox say could be one for the ages. ""We think (Titanfall) can very much be a game-defining moment for Xbox One as a platform because of how much it has lit up the imagination of gamers everywhere and how it takes advantage of the unique features of Xbox One,"" said Microsoft Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi. ""I think people really are excited about it. It is why people spent hundreds of dollars to have the best game experience possible."" Some of the creators of ""Titanfall"" have a pretty good idea what it is like to have that kind of pressure on a game. Respawn founder and CEO Vince Zampella was also the CEO of Infinity Ward, which developed the hit, ""Call of Duty"" series. Zampella told CNN he is amazed about the level of excitement for his new game, and welcomes the expectations. ""You put your heart into it. You want it to be the best thing ever and you want it to be universally accepted as well,"" he said. ""It blows us away -- the enthusiasm for the title."" Asked if the expectations were too great for ""Titanfall,"" he said with a laugh, ""If I say yes, it makes me look like I don't have confidence in the game. If I say no, it feels like I'm being arrogant."" Zampella said ""Titanfall"" couldn't have existed without the increased gaming power and features of the Xbox One console. He said Microsoft's cloud architecture allows designers to raise the visual and competitive level of the game without sacrificing other elements. ""Where we take advantage of it really is using Microsoft's back end to do things we couldn't normally do in multiplayer games like putting all that AI (artificial intelligence) and that extra flash in those cinematic moments,"" he said. ""We are able to do much more with the game. With Microsoft providing that to us, that's money and resources that we really didn't have."" Microsoft's Mehdi said game developers were able to store a lot of the computing that ""Titanfall"" uses directly onto Microsoft servers. ""That's something unique that we've done with these dedicated servers,"" he said. ""We've spent a lot of money to back every Xbox One console with hundreds of thousands of servers to have great gameplay."" ""Titanfall's"" appeal lies in its ability to allow many people to play together in a rich environment with exciting gameplay, much like ""Call of Duty"" did on the Xbox 360. Zampella said the real adventure and fun begins when players realize how much freedom they have during the game. ""It really is about that balance of gameplay where sometimes you are in a titan, sometimes you're not. Sometimes you want to be, sometimes you don't. Both sides (pilot and titan) are powerful and feel good and have a benefit in a different way,"" he said. ""It isn't just about getting to Point B and crushing everybody. It is a whole, very balanced pilot ballet, I guess."" Early launch reaction was generally good, with servers for the Xbox One holding up well under the stress of the initial rush. PC users have had some issues with connection problems, but Respawn is said to be working on those for a quick resolution. And it looks like the game itself is helping sell an entire system. Sales of the Xbox One in Great Britain have nearly doubled since Friday, when ""Titanfall"" was released there. ""We have had a tradition of a big, multiplayer, epic game that defines each one of our console generations,"" Mehdi said. ""Whether it was the original Xbox with 'Halo,' there has always been a great game to define the generation. 'Titanfall' is certainly going to be one of those for Xbox One, no question.""","""Titanfall"" could be the defining game for Xbox One .

"(CNN) -- Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott. John Goodman and Kevin Spacey. ""Doonesbury"" cartoonist Garry Trudeau and ""Robot Chicken"" creator Seth Green. It's a diverse list of entertainers with a pile of Oscars, Emmys and Pulitzer Prizes between them, not to mention dozens of big-screen blockbusters and enduring fan favorites. But they, and a growing list of others, have something new in common. All are part of projects being developed and released by tech companies known more for making products that deliver entertainment than producing the entertainment themselves. Microsoft is the most recent tech titan to confirm such plans. This week, the computing giant unveiled Xbox Originals, a dozen original television series, from documentaries to sci-fi epics, that will be available exclusively on its gaming consoles and other Microsoft devices. Leading the charge are Spielberg and Scott, who are involved in two separate series based on the massively popular ""Halo"" video-game franchise. Others in the lineup, which will begin rolling out in June, include a sci-fi drama, ""Humans,"" and ""Signal To Noise,"" a documentary series that ""will expose little-known stories of how modern technology has radically altered the way we interact with our world."" ""Microsoft has a long and rich legacy in the content business,"" said Jordan Levin, executive vice president of Xbox Entertainment Studios. ""Games have been part of our DNA for at least the last 15 years, and creating original TV content is a logical next step in our evolution."" The announcement is just the latest in a series of similar moves. If, as Microsoft's own Bill Gates once said, content is king, an increasing number of digital-age companies no longer satisfied playing middleman are making their claims for the throne. Netflix led the charge two years ago, and has Emmy Awards to show for it. Two shows for the digital streaming service, ""Lilyhammer"" and ""The Ropes,"" debuted in 2012. But it was ""House of Cards,"" which brought home two Emmys last year, that cemented Netflix as a serious source of original material. Newer hits like ""Orange is the New Black"" and a revived ""Arrested Development"" have shown its success to be no fluke. Last year, Amazon began producing original content for its Prime streaming service, most notably ""Alpha House,"" a political comedy created by Trudeau and starring Goodman. And on Monday, Yahoo announced it will be bringing its own long-form shows to our multitude of screens next year, starting with a pair of comedies. Sure, we all want to be in show business. But what's behind Silicon Valley's sudden rush to the studio? Don't be shocked, but experts say it's to make more money. ""The reasons they all want to do it today are the same reasons we predicted Netflix would do it back in 2010 and 2011 -- because when you have something no one else has, you can charge more money for it,"" said James McQuivey, a tech analyst with Forrester Research. ""Whether you charge people for the content itself or whether you charge them for the game console, tablet, or app that it's a part of, original content is one of the only legal ways to achieve monopoly power and all the benefits that come with it. Eminem knows this, J.J. Abrams knows this, and now Microsoft knows it, too."" McQuivey noted that entertainment platforms like Netflix and Hulu -- which is launching its own variety show with comedian Sarah Silverman -- often find themselves at odds with content providers over who earns how much of their revenues. Making themselves over into one-stop-shops whenever possible eliminates that problem, he said. And it doesn't mean having to build their own sound stages, either. ""Many of the production companies that supply content to the broadcast networks and movie studios would be thrilled to have the chance to develop content for a faster, nimbler, more direct distributor of content,"" the prescient analyst wrote in 2012. For a company like Amazon, the benefits could be twofold. Its original content is available to members who have paid $99 for an annual Prime membership. In theory, someone who joins to watch a show will then be more likely to use free shipping and other benefits as well, thus pumping more cash into Amazon's coffers. Of all the current players, Microsoft may be uniquely suited to this new game. ""If you're Microsoft, the place you start is with a monopoly you already hold,"" McQuivey said. "" 'Halo' is the best example, and if Microsoft didn't try to turn it into video gold, it would prove that Microsoft is not paying attention."" Since launching in 2001, ""Halo"" games have sold more than 50 million copies. The military science-fiction game, which focuses on an interstellar conflict between humans and an alliance of alien races bent on their destruction, is now owned by Microsoft Studios and available exclusively for the Xbox gaming consoles. Does that make the title a slam dunk, particularly when names like Spielberg and Scott are mixed in? Not necessarily, McQuivey said. ""Knowing you have a hot property and turning it into a hit are two very different things,"" he said. ""There is no guarantee that one leads naturally to the other and in fact, many people have failed with even more obvious opportunities in the history of the entertainment business. ""See Matthew Broderick's 'Godzilla,' any G.I. Joe movie, and the last two Superman movies if you need further evidence.""","Microsoft announces Xbox Originals, a slate of original TV series .

"(CNN) -- Nobody found out  who shot J.R. on Facebook. And none of us first saw Bob Newhart wake up with Suzanne Pleshette in an Instagram photo. But that was then and this, in all its Tivo, Twitter and Hulu-centric glory, is now. In 2014, technology has handed us unprecedented flexibility in how we keep up with our favorite shows. But it's also making it harder than ever to avoid walking headlong into spoilers. One social-media click, and you can spoil some of television's biggest moments for other people who may be enjoying the same shows at a more leisurely pace. Despite the wealth of tech-driven options for watching and sharing TV, we still can't seem to agree on the proper etiquette for how to chat online about it without ruining it for somebody else. Some of us count ourselves among the No Spoiler Extremists: ""Enjoyed the show? Well, shut up about it, unless you know you're talking with (or typing to) someone else who's already seen it."" (Full disclosure: That's coming from someone who, as an excitable lad, responded to a question about ""Return of the Jedi,"" with, ""It was great! But Yoda dies."") At the other end of the spectrum is the Not My Problem Brigade: ""Don't want to be spoiled? Then watch the show when it airs or stay off social media until you do. Daryl's hair on 'The Walking Dead' is particularly luscious tonight and I must tell the world!"" Then there are all the other folks who fall somewhere in the middle. So, let's try to find a happy medium, shall we? Here are some tips for both the potential spoiler and the potential spoilee to help keep all of us TV watchers spoiler-free. Twitter . If you're a spoiler: Go there. Unlike other social platforms, we've all pretty much agreed that Twitter is where you go to talk about TV shows while they're happening. Just log on during the Super Bowl, the Oscars, a presidential debate or any other big TV event and you'll see why CEO Dick Costolo said the site is saving live television. Sure, we've got all that tech that lets us watch later. But part of the fun for the Web's most dedicated couch potatoes has become watching Twitter's real-time chatter about their favorite shows. If you're a spoilee: Don't go there. You've been warned. Seriously. The place is a 140-character wild, wild West. If you follow anyone who likes the same shows you do (and why would you not?), don't log on until you're caught up. 'Spoiler alert' If you're a spoiler: Use these. What a difference two little words can make. We know that most of you aren't the jackasses who ran around bookstore parking lots yelling ""Snape kills Dumbledore!"" You don't want to ruin the surprise for folks who haven't seen it. You just want to talk to folks who have. On Facebook, throwing something like ""SPOILER ALERT"" or ""GAME OF THRONES SPOILER"" at the beginning of your post gives your friends at least a fighting chance to avert their eyes. If you're a spoilee: Scan carefully . We've all been blindsided by spoilers, and sometimes there's not much you can do about it. Witness all the ""Downton"" fans who were hopping mad after accidentally learning of the sudden death of a beloved character (two characters, actually) in season 3. But if you know you're currently missing a show that you plan to catch up on, especially if it's a season finale or other ""very special"" episode, surf with one eye open. Noticing a key word or two in a friend's post that warns of unfamiliar terrain can give you time to turn around and read elsewhere. Details, details . If you're a spoiler: Save details for the comments section. We're mainly talking about Facebook here. Nobody blames you for wanting to talk about the ""OMG THAT JUST HAPPENED!"" moment. So how about something like this?: . ""SCANDAL -- OMG that just happened !!! (Spoilers in comments)."" That way, your friends who are OMGing along with you can head to the comments and chatter away. (And, yes, we're declaring ""OMG"" a verb for now). If you're a spoilee: Uh, don't read the comments. Seriously. If you can't take that hint, you've kind of lost our sympathy here. Take it elsewhere . If you're a spoiler: Create your own space to share . My pals Chris and Kathleen are funny. And they're fans of ""The Walking Dead."" In what started mostly as an effort to crack each other up from across the room, they began posting snarky commentary, random observations and funny pictures to Facebook as they watched. Until, that is, they received the obligatory threats of physical harm from friends who hadn't yet watched the latest episode. And, thus, was Chris & Kathleen's Walking Dead Commentary Page born. You don't need a massive following to create your own page, or to start your own live blog dedicated to your favorite show. Just go ahead and build that digital treehouse, then invite a few friends you know want to play and let it rip. Your slowpoke friends will thank you. As will, you know, what's her name. The blonde one. If you're a spoilee: Stay away . If you've signed up for a blog like this, and have to miss an episode, don't forget to stay off it until the coast is clear.

"(CNN) -- It's a matter of geopolitical debate whether Manuel Noriega's reputation can be damaged any more than it already was. But the former Panamanian dictator says a video game did just that. Noriega filed suit against the makers of ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" on Tuesday, saying that his portrayal in the military shooter makes him look bad and gives the impression that he gave permission for the game's makers to use his likeness. While it's now one of the most controversial, Noriega's inclusion in the game is far from the first time that a real person -- or a fictional representation of one -- has popped up as a character in a video game. From the earliest video arcades to today's gritty, hyper-realistic action titles, pop and rock stars, politicians, athletes and others have occupied many a pixel in the gaming world. Of course, there are the professional sports games, most notably EA's ultrapopular ""Madden NFL"" franchise and its supposed ""Madden Curse.""

The new title, ""Scribblenauts Unmasked,"" lets Maxwell, the main character in the series, and his sister Lily argue about who the greatest DC hero is: Batman or Superman. Using their unique abilities to create anything they can think of with a magical notepad, the duo enters the DC Universe and becomes involved in the iconic battles from some classic comics. Jeremiah Slaczka, creative director at game developer 5TH Cell, said his team wanted to give players the opportunity to imagine any scenario, which meant creating a lot of DC content. ""Twenty-two different Batmen, 153 different Green Lanterns. (It) would be hard to find a DC character we didn't create,"" Slaczka said. ""Every time you play, the content is different."" Although the game does have a central plot line, Maxwell exists in an open-world environment and can visit well-known places like Gotham, Metropolis or the Green Lantern's home planet of Oa. With Maxwell's ability to create anything or anyone, Slaczka said, you can even have multiples of the same character on the screen at one time. The DC characters are drawn in the cartoonish Scribblenauts style but retain the powers and abilities fans will recognize from the books. Some of the powers, like Deadman's ability to possess other characters, will make for interesting gameplay. The toughest character to create? Larfleeze, or the Orange Lantern, who creates a new version, or ""construct,"" of each character he defeats. ""With Larfleeze's power, the number of characters on the screen can get out of hand really quickly,"" Slaczka said. ""You can also create battles between the Green Lantern Corps and the Yellow Lanterns."" More than just heroes and villains, Slaczka said, complementary characters like Lois Lane and new characters like Pandora from ""Trinity War"" are included. Slacska said he wouldn't be surprised to hear about players recreating other comic stories in the game environment. That's why developers were so meticulous about having as many DC characters available as possible. ""You will be hard-pressed to stump us,"" he said. ""Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure"" is available now for the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS and Windows PC. The game is rated E 10+ for everyone 10 years of age and older due to cartoon violence and comic mischief.","""Scribblenauts Unmasked"" includes more than 2,000 characters from DC comics .

"(CNN) -- The King of Country Music is once again king of the country road. George Strait had the highest ticket sales of any country music tour in 2014, according to a new list released by StubHub, and he was second only to British pop sensation One Direction overall. Luke Bryan comes in behind his fellow country troubadour at Number Three on the ticket resale website's year-end list, topping Justin Timberlake at Number Four. ""I don't think we realize how huge country music is,"" StubHub executive Glen Lehrman tells Ad Week. ""Traditionally, we think of pop music as the one that is going to drive the most interest in ticket sales â€” your Beyonce, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga.... George Strait didn't do that many dates, but his last concert ever was by far one of the biggest events we had in 2014."" That final Strait show, at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas (home of the Dallas Cowboys), was attended by 104,793 fans. It set the record for the largest indoor concert ever in North America, topping a previous attendance record set by the Rolling Stones in 1981. The star-studded show (surprise guests included Miranda Lambert, Faith Hill and Eric Church) marked the end of Strait's illustrious, 33-year touring career, but retirement is still a four-letter word. The country icon has promised at least five more albums of all-new material in the coming years. As for Bryan's spot on StubHub's list, Billboard begs to differ: It places his 2014 touring at Number One among country treks but 14th overall. It lists Strait as Number 16, and agrees that One Direction was the top-grossing touring artist of the year. Bryan, the reigning CMA Entertainer of the Year, had 1.7 million fans attend his shows this year â€” numbers combined from three different trips: the That's My Kind of Night Tour, the Farm Tour, and the Spring Break 2014 Tour. ""We've played all types of shows this year,"" says Bryan. ""It's just as exciting to play for smaller capacity crowds during a two-day run in the very northern point of Canada as it is to 60,000 screaming fans at the stadiums shows... or to the first-time fan who may have never been to a concert until the Farm Tour came to their small rural community."" StubHub is expecting big numbers in 2015 from a different crop of touring (or rumored-to-be-touring) artists: Adele, Coldplay, Foo Fighters, Taylor Swift and U2.

"(CNN) -- It's the super yacht with a super model and her billionaire tycoon husband as its joint owners and the 100ft supermaxi Comanche lived up to expectations with a blazing start to the Rolex Sydney-Hobart race Friday. The 'Bluewater Classic' in its 70th staging is the first real competitive test for Comanche, which has been specially built for distance racing and speed record attempts, the brainchild of Netscape co-founder Jim Clark and his wife, Kristy Hinze-Clark, who was born in Australia. Comanche, skippered by American Ken Read and with a strong international crew, is expected to battle it out for line honors with seven-time winner Wild Oats XI in the 628-nautical miles race, one of the highlights of the international yachting calendar. The traditional Boxing Day start from Sydney Harbor saw an early glimpse of Comanche's speed with the skipper of Wild Oats XI, Mark Richards, moved to exclaim: ""She's smoking -- look at that thing go!"" Out to sea and past the first mark in an unofficial record time, Comanche led from Wild Oats XI with the other supermaxis Ragamuffin and Perpetual Loyal giving chase. The race, which runs down the east coast of Australia and across the Bass Strait to the Tasmanian capital Hobart, has drawn a 117-strong entry, the biggest since 1994. But pre-race attention has centered on Comanche -- with its wide-bodied and cutting edge design, and two years in the building in Maine in the United States. Clark watched from a supporting boat as his wife was part of the crew when Comanche took part in the Big Boat Challenge in Sydney Harbor on December 9, won by Wild Oats XI. But the short race was just a small taster for the bigger test and Hinze-Clark opted out of competing, two days before the start, due to fears her inexperience might hamper the race favorite in predicted difficult conditions. She also has three-year-old and four-month-old children to look after so both joint owners are safely shore side to track the progress of their costly boat. ""We're ready,"" Read told the official race website before the start, unperturbed by reports of the rougher conditions ahead. ""To me it looks like a nice sailboat racing day. A little breezy, a little lumpy, but if our boat can't handle 25 knots and a little bit of bump then something's wrong."" The weather forecast would appear to rule out the chance of a new race record, the current mark set by Wild Oats XI in 2012, of one day 18 hours 23 minutes and 12 seconds, and there were several early withdrawals in the testing conditions.

"(CNN) -- An eclectic group of engineers, designers, artists, parents and lactation consultants came together at MIT over the weekend to improve a necessary, unpopular device: the breast pump. ""They are loud, they are painful, they are very expensive, they can cause pain and tissue damage, and they are weird,"" said Alexandra Metral, a research affiliate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and mother of three. Together with a group of other MIT Media Lab researchers and students, Metral helped host a ""Make The Breast Pump Not Suck"" hackathon in Boston. The 120 participants broke into 18 teams. They tinkered with old pumps and materials, consulted with volunteer experts and low-income working moms and came up with prototypes for what they hope will be the next generation of breast pumps. The winning team designed a pump for people who aren't able to take breaks to pump breast milk. Pumping while working means stopping all activity and heading to a secluded room for half an hour, multiple times a day. That loss of productivity is bad for employers and employees, and it can be difficult to do with active jobs such as nursing. The Mighty Mom utility belt turned a pump into a hands-free portable device that is worn discreetly under clothes and can work while the wearer goes about her regular routine. Many of the teams saw potential in wearable sensors and data. The PumpIO design used a smartphone and sensors to log data such as pumping times and amounts. A mother could share the information with her doctor, a lactation support consultant or a larger community of other pumping mothers to troubleshoot any issues. A handful of teams focused on mimicking the natural feel of breastfeeding a baby instead of the vacuum technology used by current pumps. A hands-free compression bra used small bladders that fill up to massage and compress the breast, drawing the milk out. Another used technology similar to blood pressure cuffs. A soft baby sling with little ears on it doubles as a holder for a pump, mimicking the feel, look and weight of carrying a child. The technology already exists to fix many of the biggest issues with breast pump technology, such as loud motors and bulky, weak batteries. ""There really is low-hanging fruit here,"" said Metral. To make the leap from cool idea to actual product, the hackathon teams need to attract funding or the interest of a major pump manufacturer. Luckily, the event drew executives from major maternal health companies, including Medela and Ameda. And the winning team gets to pitch its idea to Silicon Valley investors. The group started as an idea for an art project: to make a wonderful breast pump that everyone wanted to wear. Then Catherine D'Ignazio, Metral and Alexis Hope realized the idea wasn't so crazy after all. Spurred on by a piece in The New York Times' Motherlode blog, they got a Hack the Breast Pump group together and decided to do something about it. The first ""Make the Breast Pump Not Suck"" hackathon took place in May and included about 20 people. The response was huge. Over 1,000 people wrote in with their own problems, ideas and fixes on the group's Facebook page. Some had specific issues, such as breast cancer survivors who wanted to breastfeed. Parents also shared their own fixes and solutions. As it turns out, moms have been hacking their own pumps for ages. Some knit cozies to muffle the loud noise the pump makes, others have created custom flanges to fit their unique shapes. Instead of just encouraging manufacturers to improve their designs, the Hack the Breast Pump group is making some hacks publicly available. They'll publish 3D files online so anyone with access to a 3D printer can print custom accessories and parts that work with existing pumps.","120 people participated in a ""Make the Breast Pump Not Suck"" hackathon at MIT .

"Trenton, New Jersey (CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had harsh words Thursday for the committee investigating allegations of abuse of power and the orchestrated lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, known to many as the ""Bridgegate"" scandal. ""It's absolutely not true and it is a completely, a completely partisan act to be doing the leaking that they are doing,"" he said in response to a reporter's question about claims that his lawyers would not hand over certain documents, citing executive privilege. The governor lambasted Democratic New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski, co-chairman of the Select Committee on Investigation, saying he wanted to keep his name in the newspapers and his face on TV. ""We have fully cooperated, absolutely fully cooperated with them, and I am really growing tired of him,"" Christie said at a news conference in Trenton, New Jersey. Accusing the assemblyman of leading a ""partisan pursuit,"" he questioned the ethics of some committee members after a memo about interviews with police officers who worked at the bridge was leaked to the media last month. ""You know it's not lost on me that I traveled to Mexico and then interview memos are leaked. And that's not the first of the leaks that have happened in this,"" Christie said. The committee has been digging for eight months, but Christie said it has found nothing to contradict statements he made in January during a marathon question-and-answer session with reporters about the lane closures. ""I'm certainly beginning to have concerns about the level of openness that I've showed to the committee, because when you show that level of openness, all they do is turn around and leak it to all of you rather than to be dealing with this in a responsible way. They've been irresponsible,"" he said. Saying that his administration has cooperated fully with the committee, Christie called on those leading the investigation to, ""Wrap up your work, do your job.""","New Jersey governor slams the committee investigating his role in the ""Bridgegate"" scandal .

"(CNN) -- It's been a tough last few days for U.S. hockey at the Sochi Winter Olympics. First the U.S. women lost in heartbreaking fashion to arch-rival Canada, unable to protect a lead late in the third period of the final. Then the men lost to the Canadians in the semifinals Friday, ending hopes of a first men's hockey gold since the famous Miracle on Ice in Lake Placid 34 years ago. And now the men will be going home with no medal at all after being crushed by Teemu Selanne's Finland 5-0 in the bronze medal game Saturday. Surely no one saw this coming after the U.S. stunned Russia in the group stage and scored 20 goals in its first four games. ""The way we played the last two games we didn't deserve (a medal),"" U.S. captain Zach Parise told NHL.com. ""We got outplayed. Coming into the final round I thought we were playing well. I'm kind of embarrassed where we're at now."" The 43-year-old Selanne scored two goals in what was expected to be his farewell match at the Games and Tuukka Rask made 27 saves for the shutout as Finland collected yet another hockey medal at an Olympics. Selanne opened Finland's account early in the second period and with the U.S. still trying to recover, Jussi Jokinen made it 2-0 11 seconds later. The U.S. didn't recover -- and some would say it didn't recover from the defeat to Canada. Summing up the evening for the U.S. was Patrick Kane missing penalty shots in the first two periods. ""We didn't show up,"" U.S. forward Max Pacioretty told NHL.com. ""We let our country down, that's it."" But while there was despair for the U.S., Selanne was overjoyed and mobbed by his teammates. ""Maybe this was his last game for the national team and as a captain,"" Finland coach Erkka Westerlund told reporters. ""It was an excellent game to finish."" Canada goes for a second straight gold in men's hockey when it faces Sweden on Sunday. Matt oldest winner . There was also disappointment for the U.S. in arguably Saturday's biggest event, the men's slalom, on the penultimate day of the Olympics as Ted Ligety couldn't complete the second run. But at least Ligety already had a gold from the giant slalom. Top spot went to Austria's Mario Matt, a feel-good story since the 34-year-old became the oldest man ever to claim alpine skiing gold. He edged his countryman and the heavy favorite, Marcel Hirscher. ""Most impressive day in my career,"" Matt told reporters. ""It started 14 years ago, and I'm totally happy that I made it to the finish."" Hirscher leads the circuit in both the slalom and overall standings and almost made up a 1.28-second first-run deficit, finishing 0.28 seconds behind Matt. Ligety was left frustrated with the difficulty of the course and he wouldn't have been the only one, since half of the top-10 finishers from the first run didn't complete the second. The casualties allowed Norway's Henrik Kristoffersen to nab the bronze. At 19, he became the youngest man to win a medal in alpine skiing. ""Not all the best guys had the chance to make it down, unfortunately, but it is what it is,"" Ligety told the U.S. ski team's website. ""I would have liked to have done better, and I put myself in a position to have a chance. ""This course was difficult and it was a battle of attrition."" Julia Dujmovits gave Austria a second gold on snow Saturday, bettering the field in snowboard's parallel slalom. Norwegian legend . If this was Marit Bjoergen's last Olympics, she went out on a high. Bjoergen led a Norwegian sweep in Nordic skiing's 30-kilometer race to pick up her third gold of the Games and 10th Olympic medal overall -- no woman has gotten more at the Winter Games. The 33-year-old hinted that she wouldn't be competing at the 2018 Games in South Korea. ""Four years is a long time, and I'm not getting younger,"" Bjoergen told reporters. ""I'm also thinking about having a family. I don't want to do this at 90 percent."" Wild makes history, too . Vic Wild, born in the U.S. before switching nationalities to Russia when he married a Russian snowboarder, became the first athlete to win two snowboarding gold medals at the same Olympics when he triumphed in the men's parallel slalom ahead of Slovenia's Zan Kosir. Wild is snowboarding for Russia because he said funding was an issue in the U.S. ""I would not have snowboarded for the United States,"" Wild told the Wall Street Journal. ""I was done snowboarding. I would have moved on. I would have gone to college and I would have had a great life. ""I had another option -- the only option to snowboard was to go to Russia and snowboard."" With only three medals up for grabs Sunday, Wild boosted Russia's chances of topping both the medal and gold-medal standings. Russia's biathlon team also chipped in, capturing gold in the 4 x 7.5km relay despite missing eight targets. Russia has 29 medals, leading the U.S. by two, and is tied with Norway for 11 golds. Elsewhere, was there any doubt about who would claim the team pursuit gold medals in speed skating? Probably not. The Netherlands have cleaned up in Sochi and the men and women stood tallest on Saturday, a fitting conclusion given the nation's superiority on the -- speed skating -- ice.","The U.S. loses to Finland 5-0 in hockey's bronze medal game .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's a classic tale: Governor loves rock icon. Rock icon doesn't return said love. Governor doesn't care. Governor will always love rock icon. OK, maybe it's not that classic, but that's the story between Chris Christie and his fellow New Jersey native Bruce Springsteen. A new poll indicates that nearly half (48%) of New Jersey residents think it's ""kind of cool"" that their governor is a superfan of The Boss. That's more than twice the number (19%) who say his infatuation is ""kind of embarrassing,"" according to the Monmouth University survey, which was conducted in honor of Springsteen's 65th birthday on Tuesday. Another 33% say it's neither cool nor embarrassing, or they simply don't have an opinion. Breaking the numbers down by political parties, roughly half of Republicans, Democrats and independents respect Christie's image as a Springsteen fanatic. ""Democrats and Republicans may have very different views of the governor's job performance, but one area where Christie has fostered unabashed bipartisan support is his idolization of Bruce Springsteen,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a release about the poll. It's no surprise that Jersey has Springsteen pride. The musician was born in the Garden State, (USA), and his New Jersey roots have inspired many of the working-class themes found in his music. Christie builds profile as he eyes 2016 presidential run . Christie, 52, said in June that he has been to 132 Springsteen concerts. Yes, you read that right. 1-3-2. His public statements on his Springsteen adoration have spanned the emotional spectrum, from defensive to idealistic. The governor unleashed on one woman last month who said Springsteen, a liberal, had called on the Republican governor to stop playing his music at events. ""You're wrong,"" he flatly told her at a town hall meeting, as they continued to argue. While Springsteen and Christie have met a couple of times and Springsteen praised Christie for his leadership after Superstorm Sandy, Springsteen has done little else to show high regard for the governor. Not long after the George Washington Bridge scandal made national headlines in January, Springsteen took part in a parody with late night TV host Jimmy Fallon, mocking the governor in a song to the tune of ""Born to Run."" Christie not mad about Springsteen parody . One New Jersey resident asked Christie to just give it up and destroy his Springsteen CDs. ""He is not a friend of yours, governor,"" the man said at a town hall in February. Christie acknowledged the man may be right but said it's hard for him to let go of the musician he's long adored. ""Hey listen, I don't do drugs, I don't drink. This is it for me, OK? That's all I've got,"" he said. The governor added he's still holding out hope that one day the two will become friends. ""I live in hope of that because I think when we get attached to certain people as youngsters, which I did, it is hard to kind of let that go,"" he said. ""So, you are probably giving me wise and sage counsel that I should accept, but my heart keeps telling me not to."" The Monmouth poll was conducted by telephone with 802 New Jersey adults from September 17-21. The sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.","Nearly half in New Jersey think it's ""kind of cool"" that Christie loves Springsteen .

"(CNN) -- For most, Christmas is the time to celebrate with family and friends, but for some of the highest paid sportsmen in the world the festive season is their busiest time of the year with titles and their reputation on the line. English Premier League football players have particularly hectic schedules with three games in little more than a week over Christmas. Most clubs insist their squads train on Christmas Day itself ahead of the traditional Boxing Day (December 26) program, while just two days later the likes of Wayne Rooney and Diego Costa are back in action again ahead of a third match on New Year's Day. Costa's Chelsea and reigning title holders Manchester City are involved in a tense battle at the top of the EPL and a run of poor form in the holiday period can prove a decisive factor at the championship race. At the bottom of the table, it's also a critical period and statistics point to the team bottom of the EPL at Christmas being relegated, although last season Sunderland escaped. While their EPL counterparts are straining every sinew, Bundesliga players have their feet up, taking a five-week mid-season break with Bayern Munich 11 points clear at the top and heading for yet another German title. Spain's La Liga takes a fortnight break with Real Madrid in the middle of a 22-match unbeaten run which has seen Cristiano Ronaldo and his teammates clinch the Club World Cup and top the table ahead of arch-rival Barcelona. It's the same story in the other major football leagues of Italy and France, leaving the EPL as the odd one out, but with little sign there is any appetite for a change to bring it into line with its European counterparts. Sports fans in the U.S. are also promised a glut of action, with the National Basketball Association (NBA) hosting a daily program with the exception of Christmas Eve. But five NBA games are scheduled for Christmas Day, with TV coverage stretching throughout the day for the armchair fan. Many will be tuning in to watch LeBron James on his return to the American Airlines Arena as his Cleveland Cavaliers plays Miami Heat. James, who became a free agent in the summer after helping Heat to win two NBA titles, opted to rejoin the Cavs -- which did not endear him to Miami fans. The National Football League (NFL) regular program also concludes, with playoff berths still up for grabs, on Sunday December 28, with the countdown to the Super Bowl XLIX in Arizona on February 1 in full swing. New Year's Eve and New Year's Day also sees crucial Bowl games in the U.S. College Football season, drawing vast TV audiences. You have to go ""Down Under"" to Australia for a pair of Boxing Day events which are forever etched into the sporting calendar. The cavernous Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) hosts a cricket Test match between Australia and India, particularly poignant in the light of the recent death of Phillip Hughes. Last year's Boxing Day Test drew a world record crowd for a cricket match as Australia was on its way to humbling the old enemy in the shape of England. While the cricket gets underway, Sydney Harbor is a flurry of activity as the fleet in the punishing Rolex Sydney-Hobart yacht race begins its 628 nautical miles journey. Thousands of people and hundreds of small craft watch the competitors on the way in the ""Bluewater Classic"" which first started in 1945 and was won last year by Wild Oats XI. For other sports stars Christmas remains a time to pause for thought ahead of 2015, with the Australian Open tennis championship in Melbourne the first major global event of the year. Rafael Nadal is set to take part in the big exhibition event in Abu Dhabi which starts on New Year's Day ahead of yet another comeback from injury, with the regular ATP and WTA seasons beginning in earnest in the first week of January.","Busy Christmas sporting program .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie tried to stamp out criticism Tuesday of his policy to quarantine health care workers returning from Ebola hot zones, describing his rule as ""common sense"" and vowing that he won't move ""an inch"" on the standards his state has set forth. He also tried to address critics on the other end of the spectrum who say his decision to let a health care worker go on Monday was a sign of him caving in to political pressure. ""We're trying to be careful here,"" Christie said on NBC's ""Today,"" referring to his state's policy. ""This is common sense, and ... the American public believes it is common sense. And we're not moving an inch. Our policy hasn't changed, and our policy will not change."" What Ebola response says about Chris Christie . Christie, a Republican who's eying a 2016 presidential bid, finds himself at the center of a political debate between those who say government is overreacting to the Ebola threat and those who argue it's not doing enough. At issue is New Jersey's policy to quarantine recently returned health care workers who've been in contact with Ebola patients in West Africa. One such worker, a nurse who came back from Sierra Leone last week, protested her quarantine in New Jersey, saying it violated her rights. Army major general, troops quarantined after Ebola aid trip . While she argued she was never symptomatic, the state said she ran a fever and kept her isolated over the weekend. The Obama administration and some medical experts took issue with the policy, which was also enacted in New York, and Christie became the target of widespread criticism. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said on NBC the policy was ""draconian"" and not rooted in science. Others, including Fauci, expressed concern the policy would become a disincentive for people wanting to go and help combat the problem in West Africa, fearing they'd be quarantined as soon as they returned to the United States. Ebola outbreak: Get up to speed . Christie said he applauds those volunteers, but disagreed that New Jersey's policy was too much to ask, calling his critics ""hyperbolic."" ""When they're in direct contact with people actively with the Ebola virus, asking them to quarantine at home for 21 days -- unless they're symptomatic -- I don't think that's 'draconian', and I think Dr. Fauci is responding, unfortunately, as are many of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], in a really hyperbolic way because they've been wrong before, now they're incrementally taking steps towards the policy that we've put into effect in New Jersey."" States test White House's Ebola coordination efforts . He also hit back that his efforts were part of a political ploy one week before the midterm elections. He said six other states have adopted similar policies, including Democratic governors in Maryland and Virginia.","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie responded to critics of his state's Ebola policies .

"(CNN) -- Days after the world of athletics was hit by serious doping allegations, the sport has been accused of covering up how it dealt with scores of suspicious blood samples. In the two years between 2006 and 2008, the body in charge of global athletics failed to examine as many as 150 samples from several countries, according to a report broadcast by a German network Monday. This was a period before widespread changes were introduced to anti-doping procedures. The allegations reported by German TV station WDR came less than a week after German broadcaster ZDF/ARD aired an hour-long programme documenting Russia's alleged endemic use of banned substances. As with last week's documentary, WDR released an English transcript after airing the report. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) is now investigating those claims, but the governing body now finds itself under the microscope. During Monday's edition of the ""Sport Inside,"" a former member of the IAAF's medical commission -- who is not identified -- said the samples in question were from athletes representing Spain, Kenya, Greece, Germany, Morocco, Russia and at least one from Britain. ""Just take a look the haemoglobin values -- how they have risen in only four months by 38% and in the next four months they have fallen again by 16%"", the official explains, according to the English translation of the documentary provided by the broadcaster to CNN. ""It's obvious that there's something wrong there. That simply cannot be. It is absolutely clear to see and physiologically simply cannot be explained. This can only be doping."" President of Spain's athletics federation Jose Maria Odriozola said his organization received no notification of any suspicious samples from the IAAF. ""When we receive information of that type, we immediately carry out surprise doping tests on the suspicious athletes,"" Odriozola said in an email sent to CNN. He also outlined that Spanish track athletes are required to supply their ""blood passport"" -- a method used to monitor any potential doping violations -- a week before competition. Both British Athletics and UK Anti-Doping have declined to comment, while both the Russian Athletics Federation and Russian Anti-Doping Agency have so far failed to reply to CNN's request for comment. The IAAF insisted Tuesday that the English transcript of the documentary would be passed on directly to its independent ethics commission. It also said that ""a member of the IAAF Medical and Anti-Doping Commission would not know whether follow-up tests would have been conducted or not."" The athlete biological passport program was launched in 2009, ensuring athlete's blood samples were stored electronically and monitored over time, according to the IAAF. Samples collected prior to 2009, according to the IAAF, ""do not have the same level of reliability and strength as the post-2009 values which were collected under strict and stringent conditions."" The governing body also stated that any samples taken before 2009 were only used as ""secondary evidence,"" or to arrange ""trigger"" follow-up urine tests. The IAAF also insists that ""abnormal results were duly followed-up by the IAAF, whenever possible logistically."" WADA, the world's anti-doping agency, said it would investigate the allegations in a statement released on Tuesday. Last week's ""Das Erste"" documentary had already alleged systematic doping in Russian athletics. It claimed Russian officials covered up positive results in exchange for financial reward. The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA,) announced it would investigate the allegations, while the president of the country's athletics federation told Reuters the claims were ""a pack of lies.""","Athletics hit by new allegations .

"(CNN) -- Even if you've never visited Malaysia or Indonesia, it's likely that you've made contact with these countries through the chocolate bar you've just eaten or the soap you've just washed your hands with. Over 87% of palm oil, a common ingredient in thousands of consumer commodities, was produced by the two countries in the past year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Palm oil remains solid at room temperature, making it a remarkably versatile commodity used in cooking and processed food products like ice cream and cookies, as well as biofuels, agro-chemicals, and consumer products such as soaps, detergents, and cosmetics. As a result, demand for palm oil has been steadily rising since the 1970s, making it hugely valuable â€” and profitable. Last week, Malaysian state-owned palm oil conglomerate Felda Global Ventures Holdings debuted on the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange in the world's second largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) this year. The share price of the world's third largest palm oil operator rose by 20%, generating US$3.2 billion for the company. While the IPO has been a boon for the company's coffers, conservationists say the palm oil industry has been a curse for the environment in Malaysia and Indonesia. Palm oil production threatens tropical forests, peatlands, and wildlife habitats, environmental groups such as Greenpeace say. More than 10% of deforestation in Malaysia and Indonesia over the last 20 years occurred to make way for palm oil plantations, according to a report by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). In Indonesia, an average of 300,000 hectares is lost annually to palm oil clearing, the report said. One of the major consequences of deforestation is the effect on climate change. ""Because forested land, especially forested peatland, has a high carbon density, the production of palm oil on deforested lands causes disproportionately greater...global warming emissions than an equal area of non-forested land,"" according to the UCS report. The group estimates that growing and refining each metric ton of crude palm oil produces the equivalent of 0.86 metric ton of carbon dioxide or 860 kilograms. Each hectare of carbon-rich peatland drained to plant oil palms releases an estimated 3,750-5,400 tons of carbon dioxide over 25 years, said Wirendro Sumargo, a forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia. By comparison, he said, 500-900 tons of carbon dioxide are released from clearing a hectare of tropical forest without peat bogs. Oil palms also have less biomass than the natural forests they replace, meaning the trees store much less carbon dioxide, according to UCS. Once oil palms reach the end of their productive life cycle, the destruction of their timber also returns carbon to the atmosphere. To harvest palm oil in an environmentally safe way, high carbon stock forests, peatlands, and high conservation value forests must be avoided for development, said Sumargo. He added that the Indonesian government has routinely granted concessions for oil palm development in forested areas, which has led to widespread deforestation in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The UCS also claims the government issues land leases on favorable terms to an elite, influential pool of investors. For example, the Sinar Mas Group, which owns one of the country's leading palm oil growers-refineries, is controlled by the powerful Widjaja family empire. The company has been an ongoing target of heavy criticism from green groups for contributing to mass deforestation and the endangerment of wildlife. Over the past five years, Greenpeace has launched campaigns against snack food conglomerates, including Unilever and Nestle, after finding their products, such as Nestle's Kit Kat chocolate bars, contained palm oil sourced from the Sinar Mas Group. Deforestation forces large animals, such as tigers, elephants and orangutans, into small and isolated pieces of natural habitat, according to Sumargo. While the campaigns increased consumer awareness and provoked Unilever and Nestle to suspend their contracts until Sinar Mas improved its practices, much work remains to be done to make the palm oil industry sustainable, environmental groups say. For its part, the Indonesia government implemented a two-year moratorium on new permits to clear primary forests in May 2011, in a US$1B deal with Norway intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions stemming from deforestation. Others point out that the palm oil industry has significantly alleviated rural poverty in Indonesia, where over 10% of the rural population lives below the poverty line. According to World Growth, over 41% of palm oil plantations were owned by small landowners in 2008, producing 6.6 million tons of palm oil. The palm oil industry contributes approximately 4.5% of gross domestic product in Indonesia, according to the USDA. Felda Global Ventures manages nearly 425,000 hectares of land in Malaysia and Indonesia, the majority of which is used for oil palm cultivation, according to its website. Its associate company, Felda Holdings, produced 3.3 million tons of crude palm oil in fiscal 2011, according to company spokesman Izan Hussain. Hussain said that company's last plantings of oil palms occurred in the 1990s. ""Going forward, in newly acquired areas, where it involves planting in secondary forest areas, FGV will only do so after conducting high conservation value assessment,"" he said. ""We will only proceed if the findings indicate that no wildlife or endangered species will be affected, nor any social conflicts will arise from the development of the land."" The company has a program in place to obtain certification from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) for all 70 of their palm oil mills by 2017, according to Hussain. He said that only eight mills are currently certified.","Over 87% of palm oil produced by Malaysia and Indonesia in past year .

"(CNN) -- Yudi Rinaldi had his four-year-old son, Ryan, join him in a scene that simulated the real destruction he had narrowly escaped in Aceh, Indonesia. In 2004, a monstrous black wave of rubble surged towards Rinaldi as he ran for his life. In October, the trauma of that day was relived as he took part in a drill to test the area's new tsunami early warning system. Five years ago, Rinaldi had no shelter to run to as giant waves crashed onto Indonesia's west coast, but things have changed since the tsunami left some 245,000 dead or missing in 14 countries across the Indian Ocean region. Early warning sirens drone, and there are shelters that can hold hundreds of people. Twenty nations took part in the October tsunami drill. The Indian Ocean region now has new deep-water buoys -- or tsunami sensors, sirens, tide gauges and a web of communications systems to help forewarn a future catastrophe. But experts said the new instruments and drills are not enough. Educating communities about how to react to signs of a threat like a tsunami -- with or without an official warning -- is what they see as a key challenge. ""Technology will improve ... the question is how we go to the last mile,"" said Costas Synolakis, a professor of civil engineering at the University of South California. Did you survive the tsunami? Did you lose a loved one? Share your thoughts on the 5th anniversary on CNN iReport . Situated in a high-risk zone, Indonesia now has developed the capability to warn of the potential for a tsunami from an undersea earthquake within five minutes of its occurrence. By next year, the country aims to take its warning system to the next level by calculating the height and the arrival of a tsunami, said the director of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami center, Fauzi, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. In 2007, India put into place an early warning system that officials say is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and connected with international networks. More than 34,000 people in India died or went missing in the 2004 disaster, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Krishna Vatsa, the UNDP's disaster-reduction adviser in South Asia, said the warning system would help reduce the number of deaths from a similar situation in the future. Yet, the country needs to upgrade networks to reach all communities, she said. ""We still have a long way to go,"" Vatsa said. ""It's all about how you reach the remotest villages along the coast."" The rarity of tsunamis, which she described as a once-in-a-50-year event, makes the task of spreading awareness about them more difficult. ""You may have a very sophisticated system but the real test is how that ultimately leads to timely evacuation and actionable information,"" Vatsa said. Nonetheless, she praised India's evacuation exercises during last year's massive flooding in its Bihar state. Sanny Jegillos, program coordinator for the UNDP's regional center in Bangkok, rates the Indian Ocean early tsunami warning systems as superior to those of the Pacific in terms of earthquake monitoring and detection. Myanmar, Bangladesh and some east African nations, however, have lagged behind India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives in their investments in public education, Jegillos said. But in terms of the number of tidal buoys, the Pacific system was far ahead, he said. Stanley Goosby, a chief scientist with the Pacific Disaster Center in Hawaii, said Indian Ocean countries have made significant progress in tsunami preparedness. But while systems have improved, he, like others, stressed the importance of educating individuals. ""You have to have an end-to-end system,"" Goosby said. ""Get it in school curriculum.""","Five years ago: Limited tsunami infrastructure .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Cambodia on Monday appealed the 30-year sentence handed down to a man who ran a notorious torture prison in the Southeast Asian nation where more than 14,000 people died under the 1970s Khmer Rouge regime. Some survivors had been angered by the sentence for Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, who was convicted of war crimes on July 26. His prison term would have been about 19 years after the court took off 11 years for the time he has already served behind bars. ""The co-prosecutors are of the view that the judgment gives insufficient weight to the gravity of Duch's crimes and his role and his willing participation in those crimes,"" they said in a statement. ""At the same time, the co-prosecutors believe that undue weight is placed on any mitigating circumstances applicable to Duch."" The verdict -- which also convicted Duch of crimes against humanity, murder and torture -- sparked strong reactions as word spread outside the courtroom. Some said it made them lose faith in the U.N.-backed war crimes tribunal. ""It's becoming a sham,"" Cambodian-American Theary Seng, chairwoman of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, said after the verdict. At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- died under the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. Duch, 67, was the head of the S-21 prison. Few people brought to the prison made it out alive; only about a dozen were found by the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in 1979. Prosecutors had initially sought a 40-year sentence. The judges' first gave Duch 35 years, but took five years off that for the time he was illegally detained before the tribunal was established. Prosecutors said on Monday that the judgment failed ""to reflect the full extent of Duch's criminal conduct"" and he should be ""separately convicted of the crimes against humanity of enslavement, imprisonment, torture, rape, extermination, and other inhumane acts. These crimes should not have been subsumed into the crimes of persecution and torture."" Duch's attorney, Kar Savuth, has not filed an appeal, according to the court's press office. When contacted by CNN, he said  he could not comment over the telephone. The judge, in announcing Duch's sentence, said he took into consideration that the defendant had expressed remorse, admitted responsibility and cooperated with the court. The judge also took into account the ""coercive environment"" of the Khmer Rouge, he said . Duch pleaded guilty, but he said he was only following orders and asked for forgiveness. Last November, he asked to be freed after spending some 11 years in detention. In the last week of the trial, he argued that international law did not apply to him because he was following orders. The tribunal began its work in 2007 after a decade of on-and-off negotiations between the United Nations and Cambodia over the structure and functioning of the court. Duch's verdict was the court's first: . Another four of the ultra-Maoist regime's former leaders are waiting to see if they will stand trial before the U.N.-backed tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity. On Monday, the co-prosecutors filed a final submission in these cases and asked that the four be indicted and sent for trial, according to a statement from the prosecutors' office. It's not known when the court will make a decision.","The court has shaved off about 11 years from Duch's sentence .

"Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) -- Few people in the world have the chance to see a former pet orangutan released back into the wild and it was about to happen right in front of me. We were with the Frankfurt Zoological Society orangutan team deep in the Sumatran jungle at the site where Bobo the endangered Sumatran orangutan was to be released. I was standing with the CNN team about 10 feet from the orangutan's crate, watching in anticipation as an Indonesian man was standing on top about to open it. He lifted one wall of the crate and Bobo slowly walked out. The orangutan was very calm as he exited the crate. The first thing he did was look over to where we were standing. That also happened to be the direction where our tech expert John had placed our gopro camera just a few feet away. It was an incredible sight and a great shot. Read more: 'We knew this was going to be a trip like no other' I was actually a bit nervous seeing Bobo look at us. FZS Indonesia Director Peter Pratje warned us not to get too close to the 11-year-old male orangutan. Sumatran orangutans can be very strong and unpredictable. We had no idea what to expect. Did we make him feel threatened? Would he charge a group of onlookers with cameras? Luckily for us, the answer was no. He turned away from us and walked into the jungle. The islands of Sumatra and Borneo are the only two places on earth where wild orangutans roam free. It's illegal to have one as a pet because it's an endangered species, but they're sold on the black market for thousands of dollars. Pet orangutans are hunted and captured as very small babies from remote areas of the rainforest. It's a brutal process. Mother orangutans often fight to protect their babies, like any mother would, so the mother is often killed in the process. It's a cruel way to get a cute pet for only a few years. Most orangutans are too much for people to handle as they grow into adolescence, so the owners seldom keep their pets. That's exactly what happened to Bobo. He was five years old when his owner gave him up. Bobo was then brought to Peter Pratje and his team at the Frankfurt Zoological Society. Read more: Why you should care about the Sumatran rainforest . When the FZS obtains a former pet orangutan like Bobo, the only life these animals have ever known is captivity. So the FZS team has to erase all the captive behavior the orangutan learned as a pet and replace it with wild orangutan behavior. It takes many years to individually model this behavior to these orangutans to replicate the lessons that a mother orangutan would've taught her baby. Each orangutan has to learn everything from finding food to climbing a tree. Climbing is very important for Sumatran orangutans. They share the same habitat as Sumatran tigers, so to keep from becoming a tiger's dinner, orangutans must live most of their lives in trees. After Bobo left his crate, he was supposed to climb the tree in front of him to a platform Peter and his team had constructed. But he didn't. Frustratingly, Bobo wasn't using his training. He remained on the ground, walking around, as we followed him for more than half an hour. Read more: Orangutans stressed by eco-tourists . After a release, members of the FZS orangutan team usually follow the newly wild orangutan for several weeks during the day for until they're sure the orangutan can survive on its own. Several members of the team were following Bobo that day trying to coax him into the trees with fruit. Nothing worked. Minutes ticked by. Finally, Peter theorized that Bobo was staying on the ground because there were so many people around him walking on the ground. Bobo has been modeling the behavior of human trainers for years, so maybe he wanted to be like us and stay on the ground. We didn't want to hurt Bobo's chances of survival, so we decided to leave him and the FZS trackers to go about their day. It was too early to tell how Bobo will be able to survive in the rainforest by himself. We would have to wait and get an update from Peter later. Walking back to the camp, we were all feeling a sense of awe and hope for the future of Sumatran orangutans and for endangered species worldwide.

"Banda Aceh, Indonesia (CNN) -- Fitrie Ani was three months pregnant when she heard neighbors in her corner of Banda Aceh screaming: ""The sea is rising! The sea is rising!"" A wall of water twice as high as a house engulfed communities like Ani's around the Indian Ocean, from Indonesia to East Africa, the day after Christmas 2004, leaving some 200,000 people dead or missing in 12 countries in a tsunami that the U.S. Geological Survey says caused more casualties than any other in recorded history. I first met Ani in the chaotic aftermath in Banda Aceh and watched as she returned to the ruins of her home for the first time since the catastrophe. It was a pitiful scene. Her home, and every building around it, had been ravaged down to their foundations by the roaring waves. Ani sifted through the rubble, lifting a torn garment that belonged to her grandmother. The dress had been snagged on a piece of masonry, but the elderly lady it belonged to wasn't able to hold on. Ani's grandmother, husband and eight other relatives were sucked out to sea. None of their bodies were ever identified. Ani was also unable to fight the swirling vortex of water. She was carried on the currents far out to sea, where she drifted semi-conscious for more than ten hours. Did you survive the tsunami? Did you lose a loved one? Share your thoughts on the 5th anniversary on CNN iReport . Fishermen in a passing boat saved her life when they plucked her out of water filled with debris. Five years on, her neighborhood has been rebuilt, with homes made of wood and concrete, but little inside. The roads, bridges and mosques are better than you would find in an average Indonesian town. The baby she was carrying in her womb the last time we met is now a healthy four-and-a-half-year-old boy named Zahri. He is a child of the tsunami -- carried on the killer waves that spared him and his mother but took so many others. ""People were surprised seeing me pregnant without any wound,"" said Ani, who was convinced her baby would be affected. ""I swallowed a lot of that black, warm and stinky seawater. I thought the baby might get hurt from the water. When I checked, the baby was fine. I don't know how; it's God's will."" She said after his birth, others asked her: ""How come this tsunami baby is perfectly fine?"" Ani's new house is not perfect: It is little more than a wooden shack built with aid money. She has remarried and has another boy with her second husband, who is a soldier. Like thousands of people here and others in countries where the tsunami struck, they have tried to rebuild their shattered lives as best they can. ""I feel sad when I remember what happened to me, it's painful,"" she said. ""My kid was born without a father, other kids have both their parents. I was all alone. I didn't have a house, I went back to the refugee camp instead. I didn't get any help, no milk, no diaper."" But Ani said she also felt blessed.

"(CNN) -- Traveling just below the equator, deep in the Sumatran jungle of Indonesia for CNN's new ""Expedition: Sumatra"" series, my team and I were on assignment to capture the story of a region at a critical crossroads, where rainforests that provide habitat to some of the most rare and endangered species in the world are being destroyed at an alarming rate by pulp and paper and palm oil industries as well as wildlife poachers. As our time in Sumatra drew to a close, I knew our biggest challenge still lay ahead. We had to answer one simple question for the millions of people who won't have the opportunity to travel to this amazing part of the world and see what we'd seen with their own eyes: ""Why does it matter to me?"" Read more: Can family farming make poverty history? Whether it's rainforest destruction in Sumatra or melting polar icecaps, I'll be the first to admit that it's hard to see ourselves in challenges or events that feel so far removed, so exotic compared to our daily realities of mortgages, jobs, family and information overload. It may be hard to recognize at first. However, we are connected to these faraway places and events in ways that firmly bind our futures together. The deforestation and species loss in Sumatra is a perfect example. At a very basic level, the Sumatra rainforest is part of a ring of forests along the equator known as lungs of the world-- soaking up the carbon we produce and giving us precious oxygen. Ironically, due to burning and clearing of these vital forests Indonesia now accounts for over a third of the total global carbon emissions from deforestation and land degradations. Not surprising when you consider between 1985 and 2007, the island of Sumatra alone lost 12 million hectares of natural forest, a 48% loss in 22 years. Many see the impact of this imbalance and others like it in increasing extreme weather globally, rising sea levels, shifting wildlife habitats and crop patterns, tropical diseases moving into new areas, even regional political instability around the world. Watch now: Planting a million trees a year . Ground zero for the global fight against deforestation, Sumatra is the only place in the world where tigers, elephants, rhinos and orangutans co-exist. These native species are quickly disappearing as their habitat is lost to palm oil estates and pulp for paper plantations, as the plantations' roads give poachers ever better access to wildlife's last hiding places, and as some are poisoned by managers angry about elephants feeding in their plantations. Indigenous communities don't fare much better as they are being displaced together with their forests. Again, you may ask what's the connection? Biodiversity is the natural way that the earth manages its own sustainability. The more diverse the variety of species, the more healthy the ecosystem and the easier it can withstand spreading threats like disease or carbon-destroying fires. Once again fires have been burning in Sumatra this summer; June and August have seen some of the worst fires in years blanketing the island and neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. But NASA did not record fires in healthy forests. They remained standing, stopping the flames' onslaught, continuing to produce the oxygen we so desperately need. Read more: Restoring the ocean to health . The connection for many of us to this imperiled paradise is even more direct. From toilet tissue and plywood to lipstick, detergent and margarine, and even condoms, many ordinary household products are routinely produced using raw materials sourced from plantations that have replaced Sumatra's rainforests. The good news is that with such a direct connection, we have in in our power to create change with simple choices in the products we buy and use. Fortunately organizations like World Wildlife Fund (WWF) are fighting this global crisis. They recently launched a campaign to focus on one of the most pristine and threatened parts of Sumatra: Thirty Hills, a spectacular landscape I was fortunate to visit with WWF during my Sumatran odyssey.

It's one of the most important habitats of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, along with orangutans, elephants and the indigenous Talang Mamak and Orang Rimba people. ...check it out. In my mind there are many reasons, some we encounter every day, why what happens in Sumatra should matter to each of us. When you watch ""Expedition: Sumatra"", I hope the beauty of this special place amazes you, I hope you are outraged by its destruction, but most of all, I hope you understand the power each of us has to change its future.","CNN Special Correspondent Philippe Cousteau explores Indonesia in ""Expedition: Sumatra""

"(CNN) -- Both Brazil and Indonesia have embarked on programs to protect their tropical rainforests, which contain a rich treasury of life. Although many millions of species are known to inhabit this ecosystem, quantifying precisely how many plants and animals rely on the rainforest is difficult. David Ainsworth of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity told CNN: ""It is estimated that at least two-thirds of all Earth's terrestrial species are found in tropical forests. ""The exact number of species which depend on tropical rainforests is not known -- but they are very old ecosystems that have survived ice ages and allowed uninterrupted evolution over millions of years."" In collating forest biodiversity research for CNN, the Secretariat highlighted one example that shows the astonishing variety of life: . Yasuni National Park in Ecuador is less than 0.5% of the Amazon basin but estimated to contain 100,000 species of insects -- or about the same as the whole of North America. Environmental protection group, The Nature Conservancy, says a typical 10-square-kilometre (four-square-mile) patch of rainforest contains as many as 1,500 flowering plants, 750 species of trees, 400 species of birds and 150 species of butterflies. And new species are being discovered all the time. In January, CNN reported that scientists had found 46 previously unknown species in southwest Suriname in South America -- including an amphibian nicknamed the Pac-Man Frog that has a mouth as wide as its body and a new species of insect, affectionately referred to as the Crayola Katydid. The Secretariat adds: ""Excluding microbes, it is estimated that about 6,200 species are discovered every year and given that tropical forests contain a disproportionately large number of Earth's land species, it can be assumed that many are in the forests."" As well its timber resources, the forests have provided agricultural land, food, water, minerals and energy -- and a home for many indigenous forest peoples. There are hidden benefits too. Forest plants are a source of chemicals and medicines, some of which have been used in the treatment of cancers. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005 suggested that forests are the basis of more than 5,000 commercial products.

"Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- A man who ran a notorious torture prison where more than 14,000 people died during the Khmer Rouge regime was found guilty of war crimes Monday and sentenced to 35 years in prison -- with five years taken off that sentence for time served. The verdict against Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, also convicted him of crimes against humanity, murder and torture. It was a historic first for a U.N.-backed war crimes tribunal. Duch, 67, was the head of the S-21 prison, where at least 14,000 people died. ""It's clear that he will never be a free man again,"" said Youk Chhang, director of Documentation Center of Cambodia. Prosecutors had asked for a 45-year sentence with five years' credit for time served. Duch pleaded guilty but said he was only following orders and asked for forgiveness. In the last week of the trial, he argued that international law did not apply to him because he was following orders. Few people brought to the prison made it out alive; only about a dozen were found by the Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia in 1979. Duch has acknowledged his role overseeing the prison but has sought release after 10 years in detention, angering survivors. Outside the court on Monday, hundreds of Cambodians, including the Muslim minority known as Cham, watched previous court sessions on large television screens. Timeline: Rise of Khmer Rouge and its aftermath . ""We want to hear directly from the court what the verdict will be,"" said Tin Mosa, who along with 40 others from the Cham group, got up early Monday to come to the court. ""I can assume that the international court is good enough to bring justice for the Cambodian people, especially for me,"" he said. ""I want to see Duch die in jail."" More than 10 million Cambodians were expected to watch the live broadcast of the verdict being televised across the country, said Reach Sambath, the spokesman for the court. ""Today is a historic important day for the people of Cambodia,"" Sambath said. At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- died under the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. Another four of the ultra-Maoist regime's former leaders are waiting to see if they will stand trial before a U.N.-backed tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The tribunal began its work in 2007 after a decade of on-and-off negotiations between the United Nations and Cambodia over the structure and the functioning of the court. Chhang, director of the documentation center, said his organization was holding verdict watch gatherings in seven provinces so that rural Cambodians could observe. Chhang said the verdict may not suit everyone, but he thinks Cambodians will be able to turn over a new leaf once the verdict is announced. ""This is what we have, and then we must move [on]. We have our own identity now, our own family, our own society now. We have to build it, make it strong, to prevent [the past] from happening"" again,"" he said. On Sunday, parents, siblings, friends and loved ones gathered before monks in a courtyard of the prison site -- now a museum -- to participate in a ceremony to honor the dead. Among them were survivors of S-21, such as Bou Meng, who wept at times during the memorial. ""I have been waiting for justice for 30 years,"" he said. ""If the verdict does not please me, I will be disappointed forever."" Eng Chanthy, 47, lost her father, six brothers and grandfather to the Khmer Rouge due to starvation. ""I believe that justice will be brought by the tribunal court,"" Chanthy said.""I heard Duch was apologizing to the Cambodian people and asking the people to pardon to him, and I don't agree with him asking for freedom.""

"(CNN) -- In the high-tech world of South Korea, it's difficult to find someone who isn't plugged in. Demand here is fulfilled by the country's largest mobile phone carrier, SK Telecom. CEO of SK Telecom, Kim Shin Bae spoke to CNN's Andrew Stevens in The Boardroom. It's ubiquitous branding hints at the 51 percent market share the company holds. Earlier this year the company broke with South Korea's rigid corporate tradition. They scrapped the hierarchy in favor of a flatter management structure in the hope of encouraging risk taking and creativity. These decisions were the making of CEO, Kim Shin Bae, who's been at the helm since 2004. He sat down with CNN's Andrew Stevens to explain the hidden value of corporate culture. Kim: I think we need to be more creative and innovative in order to be a global communications leader. To create a new culture, we broke from the Asian tradition of seniority based hierarchical structure by introducing a single level manager system. This is for the open-minded communication and knowledge sharing between employees and a speedy organizational process. We introduced it more than a year ago and I think it's selling quite well. Stevens: So how difficult was it to get your people on board with these changes? Kim: Korea is basically a Confucian culture, so we respect the elders and the senior people. So with the senior people, the hard debate with the senior people is the difficulty. But by introducing the single level structure we could encourage more free communication. Stevens: Since the 1960s, the South Korean economy has developed enormously, so why was there a need to change it? Kim: As you know, during the last several decades of South Korean economic growth, manufacturing was the real core industry. In manufacturing the hierarchy code -- the strong top down leadership -- is very effective and sometimes very efficient. Now the world is changing, especially for IT services and communication services. Creativity and innovation from the very free communication knowledge sharing is more and more important so I think we need that kind of change especially for SK Telecom. Stevens: Today is the company's monthly ""Funergizer"" -- a lunch-time entertainment for employees held in the lobby of SK Telecom's headquarters. Kim: I think the happy employees can make others happy. Their work their productivity will improve. So every month during lunch time, we introduce the talent -- professionals of music, dance, or drum players for employees. It will also help the creative and flexible corporate culture, I think. All those have the synergy to change the culture. I think the corporate culture is much more important than the system or process. Our business environment changes very quickly. Once the system or process is set up, then it might have some other shackle for us to change. But the corporate culture drives the people, even though they are not the older this would do it this way and that way, so corporate culture I think is very important. Stevens: We've been talking a lot about the softer issues, about softer employee relations, rather than the structure and processes of corporate South Korea. Do you think the softer issues are becoming more important right across industry here? Kim: I think with the rise of China and India as a manufacturing base, we need to be more toward the service oriented company which requires more creativity, so I think it's very natural. But I think that creativity and efficiency should take balance that's why we also strongly implement the activities at SK Telecom together. So it's this kind of ambidexterity, efficiency and creativity should take balance. E-mail to a friend .","Kim Shin Bae, CEO of SK Telecom speaks in CNN's The Boardroom .

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN) -- A joint Cambodian-United Nations court, currently trying five former members of the ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge group on war crimes charges, is itself facing allegations of corruption and bribery. Cambodia's Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith says no proof of kickbacks or corruption has been found. Two employees of the court's Office of Administration told CNN of an ongoing kickback scheme involving Cambodian staff. The staffers asked their identities be protected out of fear of retribution to themselves and their families. ""We are talking about 30 to 40 or even a little bit more ... a month,"" said one employee, referring to the total amount allegedly taken from employees. ""Thousand dollars. Thirty or 40,000 dollars a month."" Cambodian staff at the office, they say, are forced to hand the money over -- a chunk of their salaries -- and the funds go to an official. ""They are supposed to pay a certain amount (of) money -- a certain percentage,"" the employee said. ""So every month, they have to put it in an envelope -- and give it to ... each section has one person go around to collect it ... the money is in cash, in U.S. dollars."" There is no suggestion that the court's judges or lawyers -- who are hearing and presenting the case against the former Khmer Rouge leaders -- are involved in the alleged corruption. The Cambodian government told CNN a senior Cambodian court official was investigated for corruption, but was exonerated. ""They told me they cannot find any proof of kick-back or corruption,"" said Khieu Kanharith, government information minister. ""If you want the court -- the trial -- to go ahead, separate the two cases."" However, a defense attorney for one of the defendants said the trial and the allegations of corruption are inextricably linked. ""What's really disturbing is that by the time the judges make their decision, every piece of evidence, every bit that they look at and evaluate and deliberate on, will have passed through the office of administration and will have literally passed through the hands of people who we say have dirty hands,"" said Andrew Ianuzzi, a consultant for defendant Nuon Chea's legal team. Defense attorneys say they plan to bring up the corruption allegations during the trial in an effort to discredit the court. The Cambodian government refused United Nations requests for an independent international war crimes trial for the Khmer Rouge defendants, agreeing only to a joint trial where the government participates along with the international judges.  Watch a report on the trial a Khmer Rouge torture camp commandant » . Prosecutors are attempting to prove that the five defendants played a significant role in the deaths of as many as two million Cambodians during Khmer Rouge rule of the country from 1975 to 1979. The trial has already cost $56 million, more than $10 million per defendant. But the court has asked for another $50 million to carry it through the end of 2009. The total could go higher if the trial continues into 2010. The United Nations says its internal affairs body -- the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) -- is investigating the corruption allegations within the court, but won't elaborate. ""This matter has been under investigation by OIOS, whose work is confidential,"" the United Nations said in a statement. ""The result of the probe will be submitted to the Cambodian government for further action."" In a letter sent to attorneys for the trial defendants, Sean Visoth, the head of the court's Office of Administration, writes that his office has ""never tolerated any kind of corruption or malpractice."" Visoth says the court now has an anonymous ""complaint mechanism"" in place. Meanwhile, however, independent trial monitors say they believe a culture of fear prevents other current and employees from coming forward. ""At the court, I have heard people express concerns about loss of their job, repercussions or retaliations against their families, and also some possibility of physical fears,"" said Heather Ryan, a Khmer Rouge trial monitor. The employees spoke out, saying they were fully aware of the risk. ""To me, it is really sick. How can you take money from people each month and look people in the eye and say, 'Oh, I don't know anything about it?'"" one employee asked.","Joint Cambodian-U.N. court is facing allegations of corruption and bribery .

"(CNN) -- In South Korea, telematics is big business. If it sounds like a buzzword to advertise the latest purveyor of high-tech must-have gadgets, its etymology is no less firmly rooted: ""tele"" means remote; ""matics"" means information. Cruising right alongside wireless broadband and DMB (Digital Media Broadcast) cell phones, telematics refers more specifically to automobiles receiving remote information from commercial service providers. These services could include Global Positioning System (GPS), on-demand entertainment, Internet and Web access, or weather and traffic conditions. All taxis in Seoul are already equipped with a telematic GPS navigation device. Among the corporate sponsors of telematics research and development are Samsung, LG Electronics, Hyundai and General Motors, who all have speech-interfaced applications targeting consumer products launching in early 2008. Among the top academic contenders of this highly competitive field of R&D is one of South Korea's top three elite institutions of higher education, Korea University. Within Korea University, the School of Electrical Engineering's Intelligent Signal Processing Lab (ISPL), headed by Professor Ko Hanseok, specializes in both image and speech processing. Applications of image processing include such popular consumer features as light balancing and face recognition, now standard on most digital cameras, which can also be associated with voice recognition. Current research in audio processing includes noise suppression and continuous speech recognition, which can be applied as much to cell phones as to voice-controlled telematic devices in vehicles. But while South Korea may live up to its reputation as being the ""world's most wired country,"" Professor Ko points out that on a global scale, the relatively tiny nation is uncomfortably wedged between China and Japan. On the one hand, China overshadows the manufacturing industry as the ""world's fastest-growing economy;"" on the other, Japan dominates the collective image of the ""world's most high-tech nation."" So, faithful to Korea University's forward-thinking slogan ""Global pride,"" Professor Ko keeps his research lab's projects closely aligned with what he calls the ""impact factor."" R&D value is measured in industry impact, which depends on market analysis and consumer trends. After all, the majority of his students studying and working at the highly reputed university are sponsored by the corporate partners that will apply their research to real-world products. In yet another example of South Korea's converged efforts toward collective success, telematics has united the gadget-makers with the engineering academics, as the industry driven by consumers in cars.

"Banda Aceh, Indonesia (CNN) -- Visitors shuttle in and out of a state-of-the-art hospital in an Indonesian town once devastated by towering tsunami waves five years ago, while in nearby Thailand backpackers dance to music in bars and tourists lodge in a hotel that had been demolished in the Boxing Day disaster. Over in India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives -- all hit by the waters that claimed the lives of some 245,000 people in 14 nations on December 26, 2004 -- homes, schools and roads have been rebuilt, and livelihoods reclaimed. The road to recovery in the Indian Ocean countries battered by the tsunami, which washed away entire communities, created nearly $10 billion in damage and caused more casualties than any other tsunami in recorded history, has been steady despite some challenges, according to the United Nations and local officials. ""It was essential to have discussions with communities about what they wanted and needed. The result took a little bit longer but was much better. This is the essence of this 'build back better' concept, to have people involved in the reconstruction,"" said Hakan Bjorkman, Indonesia country director for the United Nations Development Programme. ""The most important lesson learned from this massive recovery effort is the importance of involving the people who are affected in the process, in a really meaningful way,"" he added. Did you survive the tsunami? Did you lose a loved one? Share your thoughts on the 5th anniversary on CNN iReport . In Aceh, a special government-backed agency, BRR, was set up to oversee the vast rebuilding. That agency was superseded by the BKRA this year, and together they have overseen the spending of $3.2 billion dollars of aid money. That money has been ploughed into the state-of-the-art hospital, a new terminal building at the airport, hundreds of bridges, nearly two dozen ports, some 1,800 schools, 3,800 mosques and about 150,000 homes. To local conservationist Mike Griffiths, who said much of Banda Aceh had been reduced to a ""level plane of shards"" and who compared the tsunami aftermath to that of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki in World War II, the town has quickly bounced back. ""It's so built up now,"" he said as he stood near a mosque where he had surveyed the damage in 2004 -- a time when nothing blocked a clear vision out to sea due to the tsunami destruction. ""Now, we can barely see 100 meters because there's been so much reconstruction. Everything's been built up on both sides of the road."" In Thailand, few physical reminders of the disaster remain. The tourist industry was keen to clean up and move on as soon as possible. On islands like Koh Phi Phi, where the powerful waves ripped through shops and eateries, and sliced off treetops, it is business as usual with bustling bars, cafes and hotels. Today, the thumping music and jolly backpackers give the island the party atmosphere it had before the disaster, and it is the same in nearby Phuket. Lodgings, like the Kamala Beach Hotel -- the destruction of which was immortalized in dramatic amateur video, have been rebuilt and expanded. Overall, some $13.5 billion in aid was pledged after the tsunami, including $5.5 billion coming in from the general public, according to the UNDP. ""I think it was the timing. A lot of people were celebrating, it was Christmas and I think a lot of people were really, really touched when they saw those pictures,"" said Andrew Morris, of the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, in Thailand. ""It was phenomenal, it was unprecedented, I think contributions just flooded in from individuals, from companies, from children themselves. At UNICEF, we received $700 million. We know that children in many, many countries themselves got together to raise money. I think the tsunami really touched people's hearts."" Most homes have been rebuilt in the Maldives and in Sri Lanka, a majority of the lost infrastructure -- such as the 105,000 homes destroyed or damaged in the tsunami -- has been rebuilt. In India, rehabilitation is complete in the hard-hit southern state of Tamil Nadu, but efforts are under way to build a few thousand new homes for those living in high-risk areas; most homes have been reconstructed in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as well as in Pondicherry, along the southeast coast. But there have been some delays in southern India in Kerala, where 11,000 homes were to be constructed, with only 51 so far completed and handed over to survivors. Authorities blame the delay on issues regarding land acquisition and they have decided to pay residents to rebuild their homes on their own, said Abdul Wahid, private secretary to Kerala's revenue minister. Back in Indonesia, some of the housing built for survivors remains empty due to poor construction that in some cases does not include drinking water or protect against the torrential rains. In one area, stands dozens of abandoned and empty houses built by an aid agency. A woman named Mariami, who lost her husband and three children in the tsunami, has little income and feels she should have gotten more help. ""The walls are made of wood,"" she said of her new home. ""I had to change them myself, because when it rains, the water gets inside the house. We don't even have drinking water here."" Warqa Helmi, of the BKRA, acknowledged that in some cases standards were not met but said the overall quality of new homes was good and corruption has been kept to a minimum. ""The building quality depends on the contractor and material used. Some are good; some are not. The donor projects were generally good. We closely monitored how the houses were built. There were penalties for the contractors if they failed to meet the quality standard,"" he said. Many people across the region will mark the anniversary with prayers, a moment of silence, sprinkling water on mass graves in Indonesia and offering food to monks in Thailand, among other memorials as people in the region try to move forward. ""I try not to remember all the details,"" said Thai hotel manager Wisut Kasayapanand, who still has painful memories of that fateful day. ""We try to remember the good things and forget the bad things. The tsunami brought us tears.""","Tsunami claims 245,000 people on December 26, 2004 .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Like a German child's fantasy, Nurnberg's fairy-godmother-like teenage angel stretched out her arms and said, ""If you're very, very gentle, you can touch my wings."" I stayed seated while little Bavarian preschoolers mobbed the stage to touch their Christkind. In southern Germany, a lovely angel named the Christkind charms wonderstruck children. Bavaria and Tirol -- two traditional regions of Germany and Austria -- are great for Christmas traditions. While most travelers visit for the Christmas markets, that's just the start of the holiday charm. Germany's grandest Christmas market, in Nurnberg, comes complete with an angelic Christkind dressed in gold, played by a real-life teenage girl. How does a female Christkind fit in the Christmas story? Five hundred years ago, Martin Luther -- the church reformer who hailed from these parts -- wanted to shift the focus from St. Nicholas back to the Christ child. But as Germans had a hard time getting their mind around baby Jesus giving gifts, the Christmas gift-giver gradually morphed into a sweet girl who was still called the Christ child (or Christkind). I was in Nurnberg producing a TV program about traditional European Christmas celebrations. I had arranged an interview with the Christkind. Chosen every other year in a contest, she's like a rock star ... complete with bodyguard, publicist and entourage. We had been filming a montage of mistletoe kisses in action. After the interview, I pulled out the mistletoe and asked if I could give her a little kiss. Her bodyguard explained she could kiss my cheek ... but I couldn't kiss hers. Each culture has a mythic gift-giver that parents use to encourage kids to be nice, not naughty. In Switzerland children enjoy an annual visit from a dynamic Christmas duo: Samichlaus -- Swiss-German for ""St. Nick"" -- and the black-clad henchman Schmutzli, his sidekick. We filmed Swiss children promising they were nice and not naughty, singing Samichlaus a carol, and eagerly digging into his big burlap bag to get their goodies. While much of Europe is down on the commercialism of the holiday season (I even found some towns that had proclaimed ""Santa-free"" zones), much of Europe is also so secular that you hardly see any Christmas festivities. Austria, however, celebrates with sacred and traditional gusto. Visiting a Tirolean farming family, I enjoyed dashing through the fields in a two-horse open sleigh. Then, at the door of their gingerbread-cute yet massive home, the entire clan greeted us with a Christmas yodel. Inside their time-warp home, grandma made cookies, an old Hapsburg grandpa played the zither, and Mom lit the advent wreath while teaching her child the significance of each candle. Dad blessed the house from the attic to the barn by spreading incense smoke and sprinkling holy water. The parents decorated the tree in secret, placed the gifts, and lit the real candles. They rang a bell, and the kids tumbled into the room filled with joy. My time in Austria had its musical ups and downs. In Salzburg, my film crew and I hiked to the abbey where Maria of ""The Sound of Music"" caused her fellow sisters to sing, ""How do you solve a problem like Maria?"" The sisters had agreed to let us be present at their holy Mass. Our soundman carefully set up the microphone stand to the side of the altar, facing the choir of nuns (as I sat in the back happily humming ""Climb Every Mountain""). Suddenly, the old but very spry Mother Superior dashed across the altar, evicting the soundman, who had to drag all his gear out of that holy zone. We heard the music, but couldn't record it. Thankfully, the next morning -- Christmas morning -- we were given a royal perch in the Salzburg cathedral. As the cameras rolled, a huge orchestra and choir filled the place with a glorious, powerful Diabelli Mass. Austria is the home of ""Silent Night."" In Oberndorf -- the town just outside of Salzburg where the song originated -- I hoped to catch a performance of ""Stille Nacht"" for viewers. On Christmas Eve, we scrambled to record at several spots where events were to take place. But it was basically a muddy, touristy mess, with underwhelming music and not a hint of the magic we had naively hoped for. I managed to persuade a couple of musicians to perform a private little concert in the town's church for us. After a day of frustration, we filmed ""Silent Night"" as it was first played -- with two guitars and two singers. Today, this heavenly song can be heard from small-town street corners in America to magnificent cathedrals in Europe. However and wherever you celebrate this year, I hope you too have a peaceful holiday -- as the song says -- both calm and bright.

"(CNN) -- It all starts on the sixth floor of the five-star Lotte Hotel, in the center of Seoul. After booking my place for Panmunjom Travel Center's Combined Tour, I show up at the agency office at 7:45 on a chilly Friday morning in December to begin my adventure. A model of a Republic of Korea soldier stands guard in front of a footbridge that dead-ends at the DMZ. Our destination for the day is the DMZ -- or the ""heavily fortified"" Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. Passport and conservative attire are required on the day -- this is not a do-it-yourself tour. Four kilometers (2.8 miles) wide, 240 km long and roughly 55 km north of Seoul, the DMZ was created on July 27, 1953, following the Armistice Agreement that ended three years of fighting, if not the war itself. Half a century later, the untouched buffer zone between the Koreas has evolved into a highly protected ecological sanctuary, home to several rare species of plant and wildlife, including whooper cranes and white herons. As the tour bus makes its way northward along the ""Freedom Highway,"" the guides brief us on the infiltration tunnels dug by the North Korean army with the intention to covertly invade Seoul and take over South Korea. Since Kim Il Sung's combat order to dig them in 1971, four such tunnels have been discovered respectively in 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1990. The third tunnel, 75 meters deep and the closest to Seoul, is the one we are scheduled to visit. Our first stop is Paju, a small city bordering the DMZ, full of ominous symbols that double as tourist distractions leading up to the heart of the border-line tension. A sheltered peace bell, a footbridge that dead-ends into a barbed-wire fence, an exhibition of military vehicles and missiles employed during the war, the trans-Korean ""Iron Horse"" train stopped dead in its tracks and an abandoned amusement park are just some of the attractions that greet visitors to Paju on their way to the real danger zone. Unfortunately, after our extended visit, we learn that the previous night's snowfall has left the road to the Western Frontline dangerously slippery and closed until further notice. In short, our Third Infiltration Tunnel tour has been canceled. We thus proceed directly to the Mt. Odu Observatory, where we are left in the hands of our new guide, Sky. She proves to be a lively and knowledgeable lady, whose name reflects the well-known acronym used to refer to South Korea's top three universities: Seoul National, Korea and Yonsei. Among other food-for-thought tidbits, she points out that there are many more South Korean spies sent to the North than North Korean spies sent to the South (see also the movie ""Silmido""), which coincidentally puts the whole infiltration-tunnel propaganda into perspective. After a traditional Korean lunch of bulgogi (grilled beef) or bibimbap (baked rice) at a roadside restaurant and a short documentary screening at Camp Bonifas, we finally arrive at our main destination of Panmunjom, officially called JSA (Joint Security Area) (see also the movie ""JSA""). Building up excitement, we are greeted by a sign that reads: ""Clear all weapons before entering compound."" After a careful passport check, we are instructed to ""don't read, just sign"" a Visitor's Declaration (later returned to us) stating that ""Although incidents are not anticipated, the United Nations Command, the United States of America, and the Republic of Korea cannot guarantee the safety of visitors and may not be held accountable in the event of a hostile enemy act."" As the bus progresses into the lot where we will transfer to a U.N. vehicle, Sky warns us of previous tourist ""incidents"" resulting in a sudden tour cancellation for all participants, including one in which a man was carrying an unauthorized flask of newly purchased soju (rice wine). In another, much more serious breach, one ""tourist"" turned out to be an expelled North Korean trying to get back across the border. In yet another incident, a German human-rights activist tried to backstep into the North. These weren't the first time the tours have been considered as a potential penetration route by either side. Both South and North Korea offer tours of the DMZ, while the tourists who take in the sight from the North are predominantly Chinese. In our tour group today are mostly Americans and Asians, including a few Singaporeans and lots of Japanese. The U.S. military's USO (United Service Organizations) also provides tours, as well as the official JSA dress code, which specifies no baggy pants, graffitied T-shirts, among others. Not so long ago, even jeans were outruled, being perceived by the North as linked to American decadence. Once we are seated inside the U.N. vehicle, passports are examined a second time, along with a quick dress-code check. Mini skirts, heels and flip-flops are out, although sneakers seemed to be accepted -- ""so you can run faster"" in case of emergency, informs Sky. We are led in an orderly single file into one of the small blue U.N. conference rooms that straddles the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), where heated scuffles have been known to break out between delegates of North and South. The southern ROK (Republic of Korea) soldiers in particular are known to be exceptionally fit, running several kilometers each day, while many are certified taekwondo masters. Only once inside is photography allowed, but no touching -- that includes our hosts, the hard-hatted ROK soldiers, whose dark glasses make eye-contact impossible. ""I feel very comfortable today,"" remarks Sky, referring to the visible absence of KPA (Korean People's Army) soldiers around the premises. Indeed, there are no footprints in the untreaded snow north of the MDL just outside. More photo-taking is permitted from a designated outdoor observatory point, then it's back into the bus for a final view of the MDL face-off from a close but safe distance. As we wait in the lot to transfer back onto our original tour bus, I dare to ask our guide a risque question: What exactly is inside the ROK soldiers' pants? It sounds as if heavy beads are shaking the beat to their every step as they walk. ""Ball bearings,"" answers Sky. ""They put them in their trouser legs so that one soldier walking sounds like a whole troop marching, to scare the enemy."" The bus makes a final outdoor stop at the highest military checkpoint within the JSA, giving us a panoramic view of the naturally disguised minefields that stretch across to the North Korean mountains. Below in the vast stretch of bush, we see a small clearing on the side of the road, marked by a plaque. We are told it's the site where two U.N. command officers were killed by North Korean guards in 1970 as they were axing down a yellow poplar tree that was blocking the view. Here on the viewing platform, just 1 km away from the building where the Armistice Agreement was signed 54 years ago, a pyramid-shaped stone reads: . ""...From the initiation of hostilities on June 25, 1950, until the Armistice the war cost the Korean people untold treasure, anguish and the lives of approximately 150,000 members of the Republic of Korea armed forces. United Nations Command forces suffered approximately 40,000 casualties in the fight for liberty. Thanks to these sacrifices the Republic of Korea is a 'Free and democratic country!'"" As people begin hopping back onto the bus to leave Panmunjom, two ROK soldiers graciously agree to pose with a few tourists who can't get enough of this military field trip. As we wave good-bye, just before one soldier sees the group off with a dutifully stiff salute, I catch a glimpse of his comrade offering us a rare smile.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Europe is investing in its infrastructure, and travelers know the results are breathtaking. With the English Channel tunnel, trains speed from Big Ben to the Eiffel Tower in about 2.5 hours. You zip under the English Channel in 20 minutes ... looking out the window for fish. Europe's high-speed rail is so successful that one airline is considering getting into the business. More travelers now connect London and Paris by train than by air -- and high-speed rail between these two cities may get even faster and cheaper in the near future. Eurostar, a joint service of the Belgian, British and French railways, is the speedy passenger train that zips you (and up to 800 others in 18 sleek cars) from downtown Paris to downtown London more easily than flying. Direct Eurostar service from London to Brussels also takes 2.5 hours. The actual tunnel crossing is a 20-minute, black, silent, 100-mile-per-hour nonevent. Your ears won't even pop. In the 15 years that the bullet train has been running, not much has changed except London's Eurostar station -- it's now St. Pancras International (in Paris it stops at Gare du Nord; in Brussels it's Midi Station). But starting this winter, the pace of change is speeding up. In December, a high-speed connection between Brussels and Amsterdam opens, cutting the journey from London to Amsterdam by an hour. In January, Eurostar's monopoly on using the Chunnel -- the tunnel beneath the English Channel -- expires. With its London-Paris flights suffering, Air France realized if you can't beat 'em join 'em. In 2008 it announced a competing high-speed rail service between London and Paris to start in late 2010 -- but the economic downturn could put that service on hold. Air France will use the same tracks, but says its trains could run faster than Eurostar's (a claim that Eurostar disputes). The competition can only be good for travelers, but for now, you'll have to use Eurostar. Their fares are reasonable but complicated. Prices vary depending on how far ahead you reserve, whether you can live with refund restrictions, and whether you're eligible for any discounts (children, youths, seniors, round-trip travelers, and railpass holders all qualify). Fares can change without notice, but typically a one-way, full-fare ticket (with no restrictions on refunds) runs about $425 first-class and $300 second-class. Cheaper seats come with more restrictions and can sell out quickly (figure $80 to $160 for second-class, one-way). Unlike our cheapo airlines, you can take two large bags and one small day bag per person for no extra fee. Since only the most expensive (full-fare) ticket is fully refundable, don't reserve until you're sure of your plans. But if you wait too long, the best deals will get bought up. When you're ready to ride, you'll find the process is similar to an airport check-in -- without all the drama, sole-baring shoe inspections, and waiting. You must be at the station at least 30 minutes in advance of your Eurostar trip. You'll pass through airport-like security, show your passport to customs officials, and find your departure gate listed on a TV monitor. There are a few shops, newsstands, snack bars, and cafes (I usually bring better, cheaper food for the trip from elsewhere), pay-Internet terminals, and a currency-exchange booth with rates about the same as you'll find on the other end. I like to ride in second class (Standard class) to save money. First class (also called Leisure Select) gets you a little more leg and elbow room, a newspaper, a classy meal, and power plugs at your seat. As you zoom along at speeds up to 185 miles per hour, consider how long it took to link Britain and France. Since the days of Napoleon there had been talk about a tunnel under the English Channel, but it wasn't until 1986 that the two countries finally reached an agreement to build it together. Once the digging started, crews crept forward 100 feet a day until June 1991, when French and English workers broke through and shook hands midway across the Channel. Voila! Cheers! The tunnel was complete. With 24 miles underwater, it's the world's longest undersea tunnel. The ambitious project helped to show the European community that cooperation between nations could benefit everyone. High-tech know-how, a shared European vision, and people's love of travel have created incredibly fast trains that crisscross, link and strengthen Europe. Whizzing along on a European bullet train is the greenest way to go -- far more fuel-efficient and less polluting than flying. Every time I ride through the Chunnel -- caught up on my research, well rested and unfrazzled -- I'm thankful for Europe's comfortable rail network.

"(CNN) -- Gem-studded pandas climbing emerald bamboo trees. Opal dragons breathing ruby fire. A wrap knitted with strings of yellow diamonds. These are a few of the thousands of over-the-top jewelry collections being shown at Asia's largest combined jewelry show this week. For the first time, two major jewelry shows are being held at the same time in Hong Kong. The 31st Hong Kong International Jewellery Show opened at the Hong Kong International Convention & Exhibition Centre on Wednesday. The Hong Kong International Diamond, Gem & Pearl Show opened at AsiaWorld-Expo on Monday. Combined, the shows bring more than 3,800 exhibitors and stores from 52 countries to show their most beautiful finished pieces. Shopping destination . It's only logical that Asia's most lavish jewelry shows take place in Hong Kong, a city peppered with jewelry manufacturers and stores -- many targeting free-spending Chinese tourists. According to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, exports of fine jewelry from Hong Kong totaled $7.2 billion in 2013, a 6.5% increase from 2012. At the Hong Kong International Jewellery Show in Wan Chai, the visuals are staggering, with a blinding glare from diamonds everywhere you look, set in every form imaginable. Trade customers carry giant suitcases, buying diamond necklaces by the bucket, while retail customers casually stroll from booth to booth. While the show is well known among industry people, it's not widely known to the general public, possibly due to a misconception that it's strictly a trade show. However, members of the public can enter with an admission fee of HK$100 ($13). Inside the halls they find one of the more shocking sights in Asia. Hefty bargains are available to ""civilian"" shoppers. Retail prices at the show are approximately 10% higher than wholesale prices, but that still means savings of as much as 70% over outside retail prices. ""I travel to Hong Kong to shop here once a year,"" said a female Korean shopper who asked not to be identified. ""I can't shop for jewelry anywhere else now -- the variety, the unique designs, the prices -- they've all spoiled me for life."" It's best to check whether a shop will sell retail before haggling over prices. Most will, but some sell only wholesale. ""Around US$1 million so far,"" said one salesmen when asked about how much he'd sold since the show began. Focus on design . While almost any form of design imaginable is available, it's the uniquely Asian designs that stand out. A swarm of delicate butterflies, all an unusual shade of green, adorn the Wing Tai Ornaments and Jewellery Co. counter. ""We exclusively use an unfinished Burmese jade that's named after the Chinese word for the patterns on deer,"" said Mandy Ho, a representative for the company. The show also hosts a design competition; winners are featured in the gallery above.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Dennis Gossard is fine with the enhanced security techniques at U.S. airports, and he said security agents are welcome to pat him down all they want if it keeps air travel safe. ""They can pat me down for three hours if it's going to save someone's life,"" the 63-year-old Glendale, California, resident semi-joked Tuesday after flying into Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Are you flying? Share your airport experiences . Not that security personnel tested his willingness. Gossard did go through a full-body scan at Los Angeles International Airport hours earlier but didn't get an enhanced pat-down. Neither, it seemed, did many people arriving in Atlanta on Tuesday. From the volume of the public outcry as enhanced measures have been rolled out at more airports this month, you might think Americans were getting groped right and left. But the Transportation Security Administration estimates that less than 3 percent of air travelers will receive enhanced pat-downs, which some travelers have called ""groping"" or worse. Less clear is how many are getting full-body scans, another enhanced measure that has drawn complaints of its own. But of the fliers to whom CNN spoke at Atlanta's airport Tuesday, most said they felt like air travel was business as usual. Of 35 people CNN interviewed at the airport's baggage claim areas in an unscientific survey, 28 went through only metal detectors at the airport they departed. Five underwent body scans, and two had enhanced pat-downs. Nearly all had flown into Atlanta on Tuesday; two were picking up passengers but had flown in the past week. Mary Lou Monaghan, 51, said she was subjected to metal detectors when she flew from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Atlanta on Saturday. But she said she'd be OK with submitting to advanced-imaging technology and pat-downs. ""If it's what you have to do to be safe, then it's OK. Either that, or you just don't fly. You can drive if you want to drive,"" Monaghan said. Check the latest airport delays at the nation's busiest airports . The TSA has said the ramped-up use of full-body scanning and pat-downs is needed to stop nonmetallic threats, including explosives, from getting aboard planes and are meant to head off attacks such as the one allegedly attempted by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab last Christmas. Authorities allege he had a bomb sewn into his underwear on a flight from the Netherlands to Michigan. About 400 body-scanning machines have been installed at 70 of the country's nearly 450 commercial airports. The TSA said there are nearly 2,200 security lines at checkpoints nationwide. Metal detectors are still the dominant screening technology, although the new scanners have been installed mostly at airports with high passenger volume. The TSA has not estimated what percentage of passengers are likely to receive body scanning, but the number will jump over the next year. By the end of 2011, the agency plans to deploy another 600 scanning machines, bringing the total to 1,000. Pat-downs are used primarily on passengers who set off either the body-scanning machine or metal detectors, and are guaranteed for travelers who opt out of body scanning. Critics of the scanners said they are too invasive -- showing more anatomy to security personnel than some may wish -- and possibly unhealthy, pointing to low doses of radiation used in one of the two technologies used by the machines. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said the radiation levels have been thoroughly tested and are ""almost immeasurable, [they're] so small,"" and the TSA said a traveler is exposed to less radiation from one full-body scan than from two minutes of an airline flight. Critics of the pat-downs said they have become more aggressive and humiliating, coming too close to private areas. Public opinion polls seem to suggest more Americans favor the full-body scans over pat-downs. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Monday showed 64 percent of respondents supported the use of scanners, with 32 percent opposed. In the same poll, 48 percent said the new pat-down procedures are justified, while 50 percent said they went too far. In a USA Today/Gallup Poll of frequent air travelers released Tuesday, 57 percent said going through a full-body scan doesn't bother them. About 24 percent said it bothered them but didn't make them angry, and 18 percent said it made them angry. Forty-two percent said pat-downs didn't bother them. Waiting for his baggage at Atlanta's airport Tuesday after flying from Houston, Texas, Eric Fitzgerald said he didn't go through a pat-down or a body scanner. He said he's OK with body scanners in some cases, but not the hand pats. ""I think the way they're patting down people is a little too blunt,"" said Fitzgerald, 31, of Sugar Land, Texas. Jerry Feldkamp, 73, said he just went through a metal detector when he prepared to fly to Atlanta from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. But he doesn't like the idea of body scanning, citing radiation and privacy concerns. ""They might go in the backroom and start laughing,"" the Dallas, Texas-area resident said of his concerns about security agents looking at images of his body. ""But my main concern is it will give a lot of X-rays to you."" Abbey Mayer, a 26-year-old legislative correspondent for a U.S. senator, said she received a body scan Tuesday at Washington's Reagan National Airport. ""I don't mind them,"" she said. ""If it's going to protect me from someone hiding something on my airplane, I'm fine with it."" As for people's concerns that the images are too revealing? ""You can't see my face, so I don't care,"" she said. Gossard's wife, Geri Gossard, did receive a pat-down at Los Angeles International. The agent asked her if she wanted the hand pat in a private room (she declined) and told her what she would be doing with her hands before she did it. ""To me, it's fine. Just get it over and done with,"" the 63-year-old teacher said. Her husband, a football coach at Pasadena City College and a teacher, said the public is fickle. ""If we get a [terrorist] incident tomorrow, then people will [complain] that people weren't patted down enough,"" he said. ""If you want security, you've got to expect inconveniences.""","Of 35 passengers interviewed at Atlanta's airport, 28 went through metal detectors .

"(CNN) -- The indefatigable Thomas Voeckler gave home fans a boost by winning the 10th stage of the Tour de France in Bellegarde-sur-Valserine Wednesday. Britain's Bradley Wiggins comfortably repulsed a series of challenges to hold on to the race leader's yellow jersey, but few will begrudge Voeckler his moment of glory. The Europcar rider finished a battling fourth on last year's Tour, but has suffered a series of setbacks in the build up to this year's race and nearly did not start. His misfortunes did not end there as he was caught in a series of crashes in the first week and also injured his knee. But all that was forgotten as he burst clear of a small breakaway group and held on to win by three seconds from Michele Scarponi (Lampre-ISD), with veteran Jens Voigt (RadioShack-Nissan) in third. It was Voeckler's third Tour stage success, having spent 10 days in yellow in the 2011 edition of cycling's most famous race. He showed all his familiar fighting qualities in the battle to the line and admitted he believed he would be caught. ""I was going so slow and kept looking back. I didn't believe I could win until about five meters from the finish line,"" he told ITV Sport. After Tuesday's rest day, Wiggins had to be on his guard as he protected a lead of one minute 53 seconds over last year's winner Cadel Evans, with his Team Sky teammate Chris Froome in third place at two minutes and seven seconds. The 194.5-km route from Macon featured the first hors categorie (beyond category) ascent of the 17.4km Col du Grand Colombier, but Wiggins covered every significant move. Fourth-placed Italian Vincenzo Nibali (Liquigas) attacked on the descent of the Grand Colombier, but . ""I didn't panic when he attacked,"" Wiggins told ITV Sport. ""He's over two minutes behind me and I knew he'd have to be really strong in the valley if he was to stay away."" Evans made a final attempt to make up a few seconds on the uphill drag to the finish line, but it was to no avail. Wiggins stamped his authority on the race with victory in Monday's time trial, opening up big gaps over his major challengers. He would be the first Briton to win the Tour de France. Thursday's 11th stage is over 148km Albertville to La Toussuire and features more two hors categorie climbs and ends with an 18km category one ascent to the finish.","Thomas Voeckler wins 10th stage of the Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- There is always a reason to party, and Africa, with its rich cultural diversity, could be described as a festival continent. But while music festivals like Mali's Festival au Desert and Morocco's Mawazine are well known to international travelers, Africa offers much more, celebrating everything from rose harvests to religious saints. CNN takes a look at five African festivals you shouldn't miss. Maralal International Camel Derby -- Kenya . Every year in August, the little township of Maralal in Kenya's Samburu district comes alive. This is where the International Maralal Camel Derby is held -- a competition between both professional and amateur camel jockeys. Read more: Lagos photo festival puts mega city in the spotlight . The festival takes place over three days and originally started to promote peace among the different local tribes. Riders from different tribes come together to enjoy the party, and foreign visitors have described it as something like a version of a European music festival. In the last few years, the festival has become more popular among tourists, and is now attracting foreign participants too. Whether you're there for the shorter 10 km amateur race or the 42 km marathon, this is a festival that suits everyone, as even kids can try to ride a camel. Lonely Planet author Stuart Butler has traveled extensively through Africa and visited the festival in 2011. He recommends that visitors see the amateur race. ""It's more interesting to watch, because anyone can go and do it. Lots of people have never been on a camel in their life,"" Butler says. Since it's a festival, there are also many other activities going on, such as traditional local dances, arts and craft and of course -- parties. Timkat -- Ethiopia . Ethiopia's most colorful festival, Timkat, or Timket, is a Christian three-day event held every year from January 18 to 20. It is held throughout the country and celebrates the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River. The best place to witness it is in the former imperial capital of Gonder, where the main event takes place at Fasiladas' Bath. This is where the royal family used to bathe, and is now only filled up with water before the festival. On the eve of Timkat, the Tabot, a model of the Ark of the Covenant, is carried by a priest in a procession to the bath, where the water is blessed. Read more: Photographer gives snapshot of vanishing way of life . ""After the priest has blessed the water, everyone jumps in,"" says Butler. ""I have never seen tourists join in, but everyone is allowed to."" Pilgrims come from miles away to celebrate Timkat, and to pray and be blessed. ""Anyone interested in the culture of the Ethiopia would be there,"" says Butler. ""You do feel like you're going back in time and it feels like you're witnessing something that could be from the European medieval times."" Festival of Roses -- Morocco . The Festival of Roses is held annually in May, depending on the timing of the rose harvest. The region close to the High Atlas Mountains supports a big rose-growing industry. The sweet-smelling flowers are the lifeblood of the small town called El-Kelaâ M'Gouna, where the festival takes place. The town is famous for the vast landscape of pink Persian roses that stretch out within the oases of the Dadès Valley, also referred to as the Valley of Roses. Each year, around 20,000 people visit the Festival of Roses, which is a three-day celebration full of joy, good food, dancing and singing, as well as a carnival procession and the crowning of a ""Miss Rose,"" who will be the queen reigning over that year's crop. Read more: 'Star Wars' film set in the Sahara . ""Everyone is wearing roses, in their hair, behind their hair; people throw rose petals and there are roses all over the streets,"" says Butler. He says it isn't too well known to people outside Morocco and recommends combining a visit to the festival with hiking the Atlas Mountains. Ben Aissa Moussem -- Morocco . Morocco is a predominantly Islamic country and celebrates many Muslim festivals throughout the year. The Ben Aissa festival is the country's largest moussem, which means ""honoring of saint"" and has its roots in Sufism -- often described as the mystical side of Islam. The festival takes place in the Sidi ben Aïssa mausoleum in the northern city of Meknès, and this moussem honors the Aissawa brotherhood and its founder, Sidi Mohamed Ben Aissa. The religious and mystical brotherhood was founded in the 15th or 16th century and the Aissawa were known for their spiritual music and their ceremonies where people dance themselves into ecstatic trances and ate practically anything, even glass, while in a trance. In recent times, the festival has become less about the glass-eating and more about the cultural events. One of the most spectacular attractions is the Fantasia, where horses charge at full gallop with their riders firing rifles. The Ben Aissa moussem also features medieval displays, singing and dancing -- and music is performed in extended sessions. ""It can be eye opening if you don't know much of Islam,"" says Butler, remembering his visit to the festival. ""My impression of Islamic festivals is that they are quite sober, with a very serious eye to it. But around the very serious side, there's a real carnival atmosphere."" This festival takes place in January and is dependent on the Islamic calendar, but is always on the day before the birthday of Prophet Mohammed. Voodoo Festival -- Benin . Voodoo (or vodun) has been an official religion in Benin since the 1990s. Since then, there has been an annual festival in its honor. Voodoo originates in West Africa and followers believe in one supreme being and other lesser divine beings, and that the world of the living and the world of the dead are intertwined. The Voodoo Festival takes place every January in the city of Ouidah, the historic center of voodoo worship, with main festivities located on the beach. It's Benin's most colorful and vibrant event, featuring voodoo dolls, horse racing on the beach, as well as dancing and drinking. The festival starts with the supreme priest ceremony, where a goat is slaughtered in honor of the spirits. It's also famous for the drinking of gin, which can come in handy for the faint-hearted.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Each summer, Europe greets a stampede of sightseers and shoppers with eager cash registers. Before jumping into the peak-season pig pile, consider the advantages of an off-season trip. Major cities like Paris crackle with energy year-round. Given the current weakness of our dollar overseas, the potential price-savings of an off-season trip are enough to brighten a gray winter day. Airfares are often hundreds of dollars less. With fewer crowds in Europe, you'll sleep cheaper. Many fine hotels drop their prices, and budget hotels have plenty of vacancies. To save some money on hotels in the off-season, arrive late without a reservation, notice how many empty rooms they have (look for keys on the rack), and give the receptionist an excuse to win your business with a deep discount. Explain that you're a senior (hosteller, student, artist, whatever) with a particular price limit, and bargain from there. Note that while tourist-oriented places may be cheaper in the low season, the opposite is true of big-city business centers (especially Brussels and the Scandinavian capitals), which are busiest and most expensive in the off-season. For many travelers, ""shoulder season"" -- April, May, early June, September and early October -- offers the best mix of peak-season and off-season pros and cons. In shoulder season you'll enjoy decent weather, long days, fewer crowds and a local tourist industry that is still eager to please and entertain. Outside of peak season, adventurers loiter all alone through Leonardo's home, ponder un-pestered in Rome's Forum, kick up sand on virgin beaches and chat with laid-back guards by log fires in French chateaux. In wintertime Venice you can be alone atop St. Mark's bell tower, watching the clouds of your breath roll over the Byzantine domes of the church to a horizon of cut-glass Alps. Below, on St. Mark's Square, hungry pigeons fidget and wonder, ""Where are the tourists?"" Without the crowds, you can enjoy step-right-up service at tourist offices and experience a more European Europe. Although many popular tourist-oriented parks, shows and tours will be closed, off-season is in-season for the high culture: plays and operas are in their crowd-pleasing glory. For instance, in Vienna, while the Boys Choir, Opera and Spanish Riding School are scarce in the summer, all have a busy schedule of performances through the rest of the year. Europe's major cities crackle with energy year-round. In London, you can spend your days at the British Museum and National Gallery, and your nights at a cozy pub or a world-class play. In Paris -- the City of Light that always sparkles -- you can get face-to-face with Mona and scale the Eiffel Tower. In Florence, you'll see Renaissance paintings and Michelangelo's David without peak-season crowds. But winter travel has its drawbacks. Because much of Europe is in Canadian latitudes, the days are short. It's dark by 5 p.m. The weather can be miserable -- cold, windy, and drizzly -- and then turn worse. But just as summer can be wet and gray, winter can be crisp and blue, and even into mid-November, hillsides blaze with colorful leaves. To thrive in the winter, you'll need to get the most out of your limited daylight hours. Start early and eat a quick lunch. Pack for the cold and wet -- layers, rainproof parka, gloves, wool hat, long johns, waterproof shoes and an umbrella. Use undershirts to limit the washing of slow-drying heavy shirts. Dress warmly. Cold weather is colder when you're outdoors trying to enjoy yourself all day long. And cheap hotels are not always adequately heated in the off-season. Off-season hours are limited. Tourist information offices normally stay open year-round but have shorter hours in the winter. While most sights stay open through the winter, they typically operate on shorter schedules (such as 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. rather than 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.), with darkness often determining the closing time. Winter sightseeing is fine in big cities, which bustle year-round, but it's more frustrating in small tourist towns, which often close down entirely. In December many beach resorts are shut up as tight as canned hams. While Europe's wonderful outdoor evening ambience survives year-round in the south, wintertime streets are empty in the north after dark. English-language tours, common in the summer, are rare during the off-season, when most visitors are natives. Another disadvantage of winter travel is loneliness. The solo traveler won't have the built-in camaraderie of other travelers that he or she would find in peak season. Still, this can be a plus, since it encourages you to really connect with the locals you traveled halfway around the world to meet. Regardless of when you go, if your objective is to ""meet the people,"" you'll find Europe filled with them 365 days a year.

"London (CNN) -- In an era of porn star politicians, legalized marijuana trade and same-sex marriage, it might seem that our liberalism knows no bounds. But this idea runs aground at the door of the bathroom, a subject still abjured in polite society. ""Nobody knows better than me,"" laughs Professor Barbara Penner, Senior Lecturer at The Bartlett School of Architecture and a leading toilet specialist. ""Everybody asks why I don't talk about Shakespeare or something nice. It's hard to talk about toilets in a serious or critical way."" But the author of Bathroom 2014 wants us to try, because she believes there is something deeply unhealthy about the way we perceive and relate to our most intimate facilities. In a new exhibition Toilets: Evolution or Revolution, hosted by Japanese manufacturer TOTO as part of the London Design Festival, Penner critiques the designs that have dominated the era, as well as exploring the possibilities of more progressive ideas. ""We tend to think of our model as normal and natural,"" says Penner. ""An underlying aim of the exhibition is to make people think why a toilet looks the way it does, and how else it could look."" The collection of classic images shows the dominance of the modernist aesthetic over the 20th Century in the West, which the professor defines as: ""white, functional and utilitarian...the toilet was a symbol of modernist values of hygiene and cleanliness, supposed to represent progressive civilization."" Penner contrasts this with ancient civilizations such as Rome, with its culture of communal bathing, and contemporary mores abroad, such as the Indian disregard for privacy. She highlights the futuristic designs of Buckminster Fuller, who envisioned a portable bathroom with inbuilt recycling features in his Dymaxion house. The exhibition also charts the emergence of alternatives to the ""hard, unyielding, standardized space"" of modernists, which placed greater emphasis on pleasure and style, placing bathrooms on a par with other rooms of the house. From the soft shapes and warm colors that accompanied the 1960's sexual revolution, to the incorporation of technology in Sanyo's self-cleaning bath of the 1970's - subsequently adapted for nursing homes - innovation thrived in the post-war period. Today, the modernist style has endured, but is being updated with technology advances that also change and personalize the experience, shown in Toto's display models of self-cleaning, germ-killing, temperature-controlled, resource-efficient ""Cadillac"" models. But to popularize a new concept requires cultural change that allows openness about the subject. ""It happened with sex and now I believe toilets are the final frontier of taboo"", says Penner, who believes we have something approach a psychological disorder. ""I would characterize it as schizophrenia. We lavish money on bathrooms, it's common for people to spend $25,000 on them...but in public they are supposed to be invisible."" An imperative to increase our engagement with our bathrooms comes from resource scarcity, which makes the 50 liters of potable water lost with every flush ever less affordable. Penner highlights California's drought, which has driven a movement to recycle toilet water for drinking, as an example of the need to move beyond ""flush and forget"". Whether it is through low-tech, off-grid systems, closed-loop recycling, or luxurious experiences for the indulgent, new concepts for bathrooms are finally arriving to meet modern challenges. If only we could face them.","Toilets: Evolution or Revolution explores our relationships with these intimate facilities .

"London (CNN) -- It is rare for me to attend a retrospective of someone's passion, their life's work, while chatting to that person amid that work. But that's what happened when I met the friendly and very talkative Jean Paul Gaultier. He gave me 15 minutes of his time, surrounded by some 165 garments stretching throughout his 38 years as a fashion designer. I told his PR person I needed five minutes, she told me Gaultier would chat too much to fit that window. She was correct. ""The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier; From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk"" is open now and runs through the summer at London's Barbican center. I started my interview by delicately pointing out retrospectives tend to come when someone is ready to retire, to slow down. I was surprised he agreed. ""Of course I want you to say that. I feel the same,"" the 61-year-old Gaultier exclaimed with a big grin on his face. He stressed he still has to produce clothes for eight shows a year, but that it is time to slow down. From now on, Gaultier told me, he might only do one show a year. ""It's a lot, a lot, a lot. So, it's true, I have arrived at a point where I can see the work I have done, you know. And I am still doing, but maybe I will restrain [it] a little."" Gaultier also surprised me by insisting he is not an artist, though he said he can be inspired by art. I would say his tartan punk, his Madonna Blond Ambition Tour costumes, and his chic rabbi garment from the 1993 collection that caused outrage could very much be seen as art. Exhibition curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot agreed. ""When you see the work, some of his dresses, I think it is art,"" Loriot said. Pointing to a leopard skin dress from the Russian collection of 1997 as an example, Loriot added: ""I think you can have the same emotion when you see haute couture as a sculpture or a painting."" Gaultier told me he did not sell any garments from his first two shows. Then, a piece sold from his third collection in 1976. At that time, his focus was Brit Punk and some bands would buy his clothes without his knowledge, Gaultier said. He'd realize only when seeing the video. Of course, that was not the case with the likes of Madonna and Kylie Minogue, who have proudly warn his creations on stage. And paid for them, if Gaultier is to be believed. He insists he never gives his clothes away to gain publicity. ""Honestly, I think I am of the generation that, you know, the people that have the money to pay should pay."" Gaultier says he's no businessman, but that sounds like good business practice. ""It was very good to have clothes that sell. For me the purpose was to sell, even if it looked sometime provocative, I didn't do it to show my own fantasy, some fantasy, or to show art.""","CNN's Jim Boulden sat down with designer Jean Paul Gaultier to talk to him about his career .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- After harsh criticism and controversy, the 2010 Commonwealth Games began Sunday in New Delhi with a lavish opening ceremony. Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium gleamed with multi-colored lights as representatives from Commonwealth countries walked the length of the field by turns, waving their flags and wearing traditional native costumes. It's the first time India has hosted the international sporting event between countries of the former British Empire. The games, held every four years, include many Olympic events as well as other sports played traditionally in those countries. Are you in India for the games? Share you photos and videos . Britain's Prince Charles and Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil officially declared the games open. Prince Charles was representing his mother, Queen Elizabeth. As the spotlight shines on the country, a team official of the nation's bowling team was suspected of having dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease. Ruptu Gogoi is undergoing tests and the doctor will get the results Sunday evening, said Dr. Om Bharti, who was on duty at GB Pant hospital. Despite the setback, the event began as planned. Excitement filled the air in New Delhi after days of fears that India simply would not be ready in time. Athletes had expressed alarm over the poor condition of their village. Others charged shoddy construction and slammed the government for corruption. The games give India an opportunity to promote a shiny image as an emerging power. The government spent billions on a new international airport, additional metro lines and fresh landscaping along dingy Delhi roads. Still, India remains a country with millions of poor people, who feel brushed aside as the new India tried to put its best face forward. People like Shanti, a 65-year-old beggar, who said she was detained by police for sitting on the side of a street, where she always sits, hoping that passers-by will drop a few coins in her hands. Or Mala Mangla, who sells balloons on the streets. She said police have told her to disappear for at least a month. India, they said, was trying to hide them from foreign visitors. They said beggars have been warned to stay off the streets. So have vendors and children who are commonly seen going from car to car begging. And shanties have been torn down. ""There has been a very strong movement by the government .. to get rid of the filth and to portray the beautified and shining India,"" said Maushmi Basu, a migrant worker activist. Police and government officials contacted by CNN did not return calls. The Indian government maintains that it respects the rights of the poor. But there are also laws against begging and putting up structures without proper permits. The games have been a tough act for a nation that has never hosted such a large international event. Parliament has been forced to deal with accusations of corruption in the planning of the games. Two weeks ago, gunmen fired on a tourist bus in New Delhi and injured two Taiwanese tourists. A car blaze turned out to be a crudely manufactured bomb. And a militant group warned that it planned to target the games. Indian law enforcement authorities responded with a heightened security plan, placing thousands of extra forces on the streets of the capital. If all that weren't enough, two days before athletes were scheduled to begin arriving, complaints rang out across the globe about their shoddy living quarters. ""You know, construction dust is still there, filth, excrement, it really is disgusting in parts and it really requires a professional deep clean throughout the entire complex,"" said Michael Hooper, chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Games Federation. As if to amplify Hooper's complaint, a pedestrian bridge leading to Nehru stadium collapsed that same day. India's image was slipping faster than a rocket. Two world-class athletes canceled their trips, citing security and health concerns. Entire teams threatened to do the same, while others delayed their arrival date. Indian officials went to work on a massive clean-up effort. In the end, athletes from 71 countries showed up and have settled in. India still wants to make a lasting impression on its visitors. Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit said she hoped the Commonwealth Games would leave a legacy that will ultimately make life more comfortable for the residents of India's sprawling capital -- rich and poor. Organizers certainly hope that with opening ceremonies Sunday, the glow will wipe out the gloom. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Commonwealth Games kick-off with lavish ceremony .

"(CNN) -- The country that once put the Commonwealth Games in serious jeopardy could become the first from Africa to host the event. On Monday, the South African city of Durban joined Edmonton in Canada as the only bidders for the 2022 Games. Having never staged an Olympic Games, the bid has been described as a hugely significant moment for Africa. ""We've done exhaustive background work and are now of the opinion the country is ready for a major multi-code sports event,"" said Gideon Sam, President of the South African Sport Confederation and Olympic Committe (Sascoc). ""We are proud to announce our intention to bid for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. It's a huge step forward in our history - and that of the African continent."" It is also a distant cry from 1986 when the Games took place in the Scottish capital Edinburgh. Now known as the 'Boycott Games', over half the 59 Commonwealth nations refused to compete in protest at the attitude of the government of Margaret Thatcher to sporting links with South Africa, which was then under apartheid rule. The 32 nations that stayed away mainly came from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, and they put the Games under intense financial strain. Should Durban win the right to stage the 2022 Games, it would raise the question of when Africa might finally host an Olympic Games. When Brazil's Rio de Janeiro stages the Olympics in two years' time, Africa will be the only continent not to have hosted the world's most important multi-sports event. Cape Town unsuccessfully bid for the 2004 Olympics while Sascoc had strongly considered bidding for the 2024 event before deciding against it. ""The ambition is to consider (the) 2024 (Olympics),"" a Sascoc spokesperson said in 2011, a year after South Africa hosted the first football World Cup on African soil. But Sam believes the time is right for Africa to finally stage the Games, following the disappointment of Nigerian capital Abuja to win the 2014 Games. The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) vice-president says South Africa's previous ability to stage major sporting events will hold it in good stead. ""These are exciting times for South African sport,"" said Sam. ""Over the years we have shown our ability to stage the biggest sporting events, with Rugby and Cricket World Cups being an example, plus of course the 2010 World Cup."" Monday was the deadline for nations to hand over official notes of interest for staging the 2022 event, and their late arrival may have caused some concern for Games officials. Last month, Mike Hooper, the CGF chief executive, said the Games could end in 2018, when Australia will host, should no bidder for the 2022 Games come forward. Concerns have been growing about the cost of staging the event, with organizers saying that a possible way of avoiding this would be to reduce the number of different disciplines from 17 to 10. However, Monday's bids have given the CGF a significant boost. ""This is an exciting development for the Games movement, one that reinforces the Games' position on the world's sporting stage,"" said CGF president Prince Tunku Imran. ""The future outlook for the Commonwealth Games is extremely positive."" Edmonton, which last hosted in 1978, will be South Africa's rival when the awarding decision takes place in September 2015. ""Hosting the games in 2022 will demonstrate to the world how much Edmonton has evolved,"" said Mayor Don Iveson in a statement. Canada was the first country to stage the Commonwealth Games, when Hamilton hosted in 1930, and has held it on three more occasions since. Both Edmonton and Durban need to hand over confirmed bids in March 2015. The next Commonwealth Games will take place in the Scottish city Glasgow in July.","Edmonton and Durban declare official interest in hosting 2022 Commonwealth Games .

"(CNN) -- Usually television focuses its attention on winners, but American Andrew Talansky's fighting spirit and never-say-die attitude prompted a rethink Wednesday in one of the world's toughest sporting events. Appropriately nicknamed the ""Pit Bull,"" Talansky had to show all those qualities just to get to the finish of the 11th stage of the Tour de France. Heavy falls on previous days had rendered the former outsider for yellow jersey honors a relative passenger -- over 14 minutes adrift of race leader Vincenzo Nibali of Italy after the 10th stage ahead of Tuesday's rest day. Little good that had done the former U.S. Collegiate champion, who was born in Miami. According to his Garmin-Sharp team, Talansky had awoken with a very sore back as a result of his injuries and it was clear from the start of the 187.5 km leg from Besancon to Oyonaxx that he was in trouble. The terrain for most of the stage was flat and riders of his quality usually have little difficulty in staying with the main bunch, gaining shelter from other riders, but not for Talansky this day. With 82km to go he became distanced and as a winner of the prestigious Dauphine Libere race just ahead of the Tour, the television coverage took an interest in his plight. So as Nibali and the other leaders rode comfortably along, Talansky was seen with his face etched in agony and with tears in his eyes. Even for one with such dogged determination the hopelessness of his plight was apparent and with 60km to go Talansky briefly stopped to talk with his team managers. The official Tour de France website reported he had quit and nobody could have criticized him, but moments later Talansky was back in the saddle, grimacing again and slipping even further off the pace. The closing kilometers of the stage took the peloton over some testing short climbs and it was a whittled down leading group which rolled into Oyonaxx. Nibali and his Astana team did an excellent job of controlling the race so he came under no danger, but French rider Tony Gallopin, who briefly held the yellow jersey on Bastille Day, July 4, took his opportunity to claim a superb stage win. The Lotto-Belisol star had time in hand to raise his arms in triumph with the fast-charging John Degenkolb claiming second. Nibali retained his two minutes 23 second advantage over second-placed Richie Porte of Team Sky with Alejandro Valverde of Spain a further 24 seconds adrift. Talansky might have hoped to be among the leading contenders, now the 25-year-old was just battling to survive the time cut off for the stage. He came in 32 minutes and five seconds after Gallopin crossed the line and just inside the time limit, with riders having to finish within a certain percentage of the winner under Tour rules. Team director Charly Wegelius praised Talansky's courage. ""We know he had a very hard day, worse than we expected,"" he told the official Tour de France website. ""It's very disappointing to come to this race with the kind of of expectations that Andrew had. He deserved much better than this, so that's cruel. It came from these two crashes in two days. ""For someone with this character it's only natural to make it to the finish line,"" he added. Talansky will hope he can avoid a similar problem over the next few days and get a chance to shine in the Alps and Pyrenees where his climbing ability could give him the opportunity of a stage win. It was to his probable disadvantage that a blazing sun finally shone Wednesday after the cool and wet conditions which have marked earlier stages and seen the departure of race favorites such as defending champion Chris Froome and two-time winner Alberto Contador to crashes. With those two sidelined it has been a gift to 2013 Giro d'Italia winner Nibali -- who looks unstoppable after winning the second and 10th stages in fine style. But as Talansky found, it takes just a momentary loss of concentration or a mass pileup to wreck one's chances in an instant and render even a talented rider powerless to keep up with a surging peloton racing at over 40kmph for the 3,664km of this year's Tour. Thursday might offer further respite with a 185.5km leg from Bourg-en-Bresse to Saint-Etienne, expected to favor sprinters such as Germany's Marcel Kittel, who has already won three stages on this year's race, including the opener where 25-time stage winner Mark Cavendish also crashed out.","Tony Gallopin wins 11th stage of Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Just like those petite waifs that glide effortlessly down the Rue de Rivoli, seen at first-hand the beauty of Paris can be breathtaking. The Eiffel Tower is one of the world's most iconic buildings and is just one of the city's many highlights. Yet like those same Paris ladies who wear their hauteur like a badge of honor, the city is not without its dark side. In recent years the French capital has had its elegant facade ruffled by an explosion of discontent among the city's disenfranchised underclass. Young men -- many the offspring of North African immigrants -- angry at the lack of opportunities and perceived racism from state institutions have taken to the streets, fighting violent pitched battles with police. All this has happened in the city's ghettoized suburbs -- the banlieues. If you stay in the pristine center, you'd never know it was going on. The ugly high-rises of the unkempt banlieue are a world away from the tourists' Paris: a timeless masterpiece of tree-lined boulevards, majestic architecture and white-aproned waiters uncorking bottles of Bordeaux. The city's abundant charms give it a unique ability to bring out the romantic side of even the most world weary. Winding your way along the banks of the Seine near Notre Dame on a spring day can feel like being in beautiful day dream. Of course, you might find the illusion comes crashing down around you when you sit down at a cafe and discover the rudest man on the planet disguised as your waiter. But what would Paris be without those famously haughty Parisians, regarding you with thinly veiled contempt when you try to order ""deux billet pour le metro"" in a bad French accent? For all its classical beauty the city center is actually a fairly modern creation. The cramped and disease-ridden streets of medieval Paris were torn down in the 19th century. The work commissioned by Napolean III and supervised by the urban planner Baron Georges-Eugene Haussmann transformed the center into the city of wide boulevards and grand squares that you see today. Haussman's Paris might look like the set from a sumptuous period drama but it's not untouched by the modern. Competing for space alongside the Eiffel Tower on the Paris skyline, is the post-modern strangeness of the Pompidou Center and the sleek glass arch at La Defense. These modern creations don't get the approval of all Parisians or of the tourists, and you sometimes get the impression contemporary Paris is slightly stifled by its past -- a victim of its own beauty. Of course there's only one way to contemplate this and the many other questions the city raises. That's with a cafe au lait in hand, seated at a terrasse watching the world, and the waifs go by.","Paris remains one of the most charming and beautiful cities in the world .

"(CNN) -- Fulham became the sixth soccer team in England's Premier League to fall into U.S. ownership when the charismatic Mohamed Al Fayed sold the club to billionaire and N.F.L. owner Shahid Khan. The deal, which had been in the works, was confirmed on Fulham's website Friday. The selling price wasn't disclosed, although several British media outlets reported it was upwards of $225 million. Fulham said Khan assumes full ownership of the Cottagers, ""debt-free, as of today."" ""It has been a pleasure and privilege to be the Chairman of Fulham Football Club for 16 memorable years,"" Al Fayed, 84, told Fulham's website. ""I am now delighted to be passing this great and historic Club into the care and stewardship of an outstanding man who has already achieved much in his life and will, I am sure, take Fulham on to even greater things. ""By his hard work, vision and determination, Shahid Khan has become a living embodiment of the American success story. His achievements speak for themselves. ""I met him twice prior to our successful transaction this week and have been very favorably impressed."" Al Fayed bought Fulham in 1997 for roughly $9 million and proceeded to pump around $300 million into the club based in southwest London, not far from Harrods -- the luxurious and iconic London department store Al Fayed owned before selling it to Qatar Holdings for a reported $2.3 billion in 2010. While never challenging for the Premier League title, Fulham cemented its spot in the world's most watched league after winning promotion from the second tier in 2001 and even reached the Europa League final in 2010. Training facilities improved, Craven Cottage was revamped and Fulham has permission to increase the capacity of the ground to 30,000. It was during his stint with Fulham, though, that Al Fayed suffered heartbreak, losing his son, Dodi, in the car crash that also killed Princess Diana in Paris in 1997. Al Fayed never shied away from doing things his own way. He commissioned a statue of Michael Jackson -- his friend -- after the singer died in 2009 and put it outside Fulham's Craven Cottage stadium that sits on the banks of the River Thames. Some fans didn't like it but Al Fayed didn't care. He now plans to spend more time with his grandchildren in retirement. ""I am sad but proud of our achievements,"" said Al Fayed. ""I am very grateful to Fulham's fans, the most incredible fans in the world. They have given me their support and affection whenever they have seen me at home games. ""I would never let them down. I have passed the Club to a talented, honest and highly capable man who respects Fulham and its traditions. He is a great sportsman."" The Pakistan-born Khan, according to Forbes, was worth $2.9 billion as of last March. He moved to the U.S. from Pakistan at the age of 16 to study at the University of Illinois, became a U.S. citizen and turned himself into one of the world's richest men. Forbes reported that his company, automotive parts manufacturer Flex-N-Gate, generated sales of $3.9 billion in 2012. Khan bought the Jacksonville Jaguars two years ago and the Jaguars will contest a game in London for the next four seasons. U.S. owners have had spotty records in the Premier League -- think George Gillett and Tom Hicks at Liverpool -- so Fulham fans can only hope for the best. Other Premier League teams currently owned by Americans are Manchester United, Arsenal, Aston Villa, Sunderland and Liverpool, with the latter now in the hands of John Henry. ""Fulham is the perfect club at the perfect time for me,"" Khan, in his early 60s, told Fulham's website. ""I want to be clear, I do not view myself so much as the owner of Fulham but a custodian of the club on behalf of its fans. ""My priority is to ensure the club and Craven Cottage each have a viable and sustainable Premier League future that fans of present and future generations can be proud of. ""We will manage the club's financial and operational affairs with prudence and care, with youth development and community programs as fundamentally important elements of Fulham's future."" Fulham's first league game of the new season under Khan is an away trip to Sunderland on August 17.","Mohamed Al Fayed sells soccer's Fulham to billionaire N.F.L. owner Shahid Khan .

"(CNN) --   In 1974, when Edward Kennedy Jr., developed an aggressive form of bone cancer that at the time few survived, his father, the late senator, wasted no time snapping into action. Summoning a group of cancer specialists to his Virginia home, the senator and the doctors debated well into the night how best to treat the 12-year-old boy, according to Adam Clymer, author of ""Edward M. Kennedy: A Biography."" Sen. Ted and Victoria Kennedy in 1997 with his children Ted Jr. and  Kara, both cancer survivors. The team ultimately chose an aggressive -- and risky -- course of chemotherapy. Thirty-six years later, Teddy Jr. is alive and cancer-free. When the senator's daughter, Kara Kennedy, was told she had lung cancer in 2002, her father deployed a similar strategy, Clymer says. Doctors said Kara's tumor was inoperable and the 42-year-old mother of two young children might have less than a year to live. But Sen. Edward Kennedy refused to accept that prognosis, and instead consulted with other experts and found a surgeon willing to operate. Seven years later, Kara Kennedy is also alive and cancer-free. If you're thinking only Kennedy clout and Kennedy money can get that kind of care, think again. While you may not be able to summon medical experts from around the country to your kitchen table with the snap of your fingers, experts in patient empowerment say more and more people are carving out their own Kennedy-style health care. ""The power that Senator Kennedy had has now trickled down to all of us, who can virtually gather people in our living room,"" says Susannah Fox, associate director of the Pew Internet Project and co-author of a report on Internet use and health information. According to the Pew report, released in June, 61 percent of American adults look online for health information. Twenty-four percent have consulted rankings or reviews of doctors online, and 19 percent have signed up to receive updates about health or medical issues. Many consumers are going even further, finding top experts online and boldly engaging them directly via e-mail or through social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter. ""You can get quite far using your own keyboard to gather expert opinions. I've heard many times over the years that doctors and surgeons are surprisingly accessible,"" Fox says. ""You can gather the greatest minds in science. It's really powerful."" Dr. Mitchel Berger, chairman of the department of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, says he regularly receives e-mails from patients he's never heard of -- and he returns them. ""I think patients are very smart these days,"" says the neurosurgeon, who flew in for a meeting of experts Kennedy convened last year in Boston to discuss options for treating his brain cancer. Dr. Raymond Sawaya, chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, says he also returns e-mails from patients he doesn't know. ""Smart people write to the top four or five major centers in the country,"" he says. From stay-at-home mom to lung cancer expert . Through her own ingenuity, hard work, and determination, Karen Parles received Kennedy-quality care without his power or money. When Parles' lung cancer was diagnosed in 1998, the 38-year-old stay-at-home mother was told it was inoperable. ""They gave us no hope,"" her husband, Dr. James Parles remembers. ""They told her if untreated, her illness was generally fatal in six to 12 months."" Even with treatment, the doctors said she wouldn't live much longer than a year. Like the late senator, Karen Parles wouldn't accept a diagnosis of no hope. She reached out to the wife of a college friend who is a pulmonologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who in turn referred Parles to Dr. John Wain, a surgeon there. Dr. Wain removed her lung and chest wall lining. After several years the cancer recurred, this time to her liver and a rib. She had successful chemotherapy, but the cancer returned to her liver. To avoid the side effects of ongoing chemotherapy, Parles, a librarian by profession, then immersed herself in cancer research. ""She read a paper about this new procedure called radiofrequency ablation, and she wrote to the doctor who did the study, and asked him for the best place to go in the Northeast,"" says James Parles, a pediatrician in Smithtown, New York. The doctor returned her cold-call e-mail, and suggested she go Rhode Island Hospital, where Dr. Damian Dupuy performed the ablation procedure. Parles continued to suffer multiple recurrences of her cancer. After undergoing various therapies, she consulted with Dr. Corey Langer, then at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, whom she had met at a medical conference. He suggested an infusion of radioactive microspheres into her liver, another procedure she'd never heard of, to treat the liver tumors without chemotherapy. Parles received the infusion, but had to appeal to her insurance company to get it paid for, her husband says. She passed away in February 2009. ""She got 11 extra years of life because of her determination to get the best the medical establishment had to offer,"" her husband says, noting that most of those years were enjoyed in good health. ""Our kids were 8 and 7 years old when she was diagnosed with lung cancer. They were 20 and 18 when she died. She got to watch them grow up to be young adults because of her own tenacity."" How to get Kennedy-style health care . The first step to getting health care like a Kennedy is to go online and learn as much as you can about your disease, says Dave deBronkart, co-chairman of the Society for Participatory Medicine. ""It used to be that in order to get medical information, you had to be a member of what people call 'the priesthood,'"" he says. ""It was a very private and closed group that got its information through medical schools and medical societies. Now all that's changed because of the Internet."" Step two, he says, is to communicate electronically with people who have your disease. That's what deBronkart did in 2007 when he was found to have kidney cancer that had spread to his brain, tongue, arms, and legs. ""Initially, doctors told me the median survival time was 24 weeks,"" he says. Like Kennedy, deBronkart couldn't accept such a dismal prognosis. ""I joined the Association of Cancer Online Resources, and within 15 minutes of posting a question about where the best doctors were, I had an answer,"" deBronkart says. He says the third step is to contact experts in the field, as Kennedy and Parles did when they were stricken with cancer. ""Kennedy was a good role model in that he aggressively pursued finding out all the options that were available,"" deBronkart says. ""You could say he scoured the earth."" CNN's David Martin contributed to this report.","Kennedy's son was given experimental treatment for bone cancer when he was 12 .

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- When he was just 28 Mathieu Kassovitz won the Best Director award at the Cannes film festival for his controversial movie ""La Haine"". Kassovitz says the best way to see the city is on the back of a motor scooter. Since then he has melted hearts playing Nino in ""Amélie"" and has made his mark in Hollywood as an actor and a director, starring in Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" and directing psychological horror ""Gothika"". My City, My Life spoke to Kassovitz about movie-making, creativity and life in Paris. CNN: How does it feel to be part of Paris film history and growing up in the birthplace of modern cinema? Mathieu Kassovitz: It's very inspirational to have seen all these movies that made French movie history and film history, period, and being able to go to the same places and see where all these pre-war movies were made. Paris is still the same as it was, so the spirit is the same also and it's kind of elevating for us directors to be in a town with a city soul, a lot of soul. So it gives you a lot of opportunities and ways of not just showing a city, but the spirit of that city; so that's what we keep on doing today. CNN: What do you think it is about Paris that encourages creativity in people? Mathieu Kassovitz: Buildings are, of course, amazing and locations are so cinematic that it's a pleasure for a director to shoot in a town like that. But especially the spirit of it, and the spirit of the Parisians, the way the city coexists with everybody and that mixture of different people and of different backgrounds. All that makes Paris inspirational for us. CNN: What was it that made you decide to become a film-maker? Mathieu Kassovitz: Becoming a film-maker was, I think, a decision that I took while watching movies. It's just a way to express myself and a way to just try to bring to people when I walk around a city, when I see something. I became a director because I am urban: I live in a very urban and fast city. You go from place to place and you never stay in one place and that's what gives you the energy. And it's so cinematic, you can't avoid it. CNN: Are Parisians the most stylish people in the world and are the men really the most romantic? Mathieu Kassovitz: I think that men are not romantic anywhere in the world and Paris won't make it change. Stylistically talking, I think Parisians have a pretty good sense of taste and they know how to handle themselves. And I think French people, the Parisians especially, are kind of classy. CNN: Your characters are always telling interesting anecdotes and little stories. Where does that come from? Mathieu Kassovitz: All those anecdotes are really part of what we are in France. We like to talk a lot, we like to scrutinize everything and just not let it go that fast. So we question everything, everything we do, everything that we see, and that's part of our culture. CNN: You're pretty big time now, why are you still here and not living in the Hollywood Hills? Mathieu Kassovitz: Why am I still here? Because this is the most beautiful city in the world! I wouldn't live in L.A. for any money in the world; it's no relationship, no comparison. Paris is a city with soul, it's a city with a past. You can feel it everywhere and I'm a part of it, I can't avoid it. CNN: Are they any places you'd go to relax or just reflect on what you are doing? Mathieu Kassovitz: No, in the city here, no, no, no. You know, my take on the city is that there is no specific place: the whole thing is crazy, the whole thing is inspirational. I don't go to places, I just drive around and I see things. I look at people more than the buildings -- and that's what makes stories. CNN: What is it that makes it stay the same, what's it's heartbeat that makes Paris? Mathieu Kassovitz: The heartbeat is Parisians. Parisians are obnoxious and impolite and everything you can imagine about them. But they are also very co-operative within themselves and are pretty open to everything else. CNN: Do you think that there's one place in Paris that stands out amongst the others? Mathieu Kassovitz: I think what I like about Paris are unknown and unnamed little streets that are not on the map, and the history that goes with it. CNN: Do you think that you truly have to be part of a city, to share a history with it, to truly represent it as a director? Mathieu Kassovitz: You have to know what you are talking about. It's interesting to go to a city that you don't know about and try to represent it but I don't think that you'll be able to bring the soul of the city in the movie. It takes a lot of time for me to get to another city -- anywhere in the world -- and like it, because I like this one so much and I know it so much that this is home. Anywhere else is not home. CNN: If Paris was a person, how would you describe it to friends?

"(CNN) -- Imagine you're about to travel to a foreign land. You've heard it can be a mighty dangerous place, but you have to go there -- you have no choice. You don't know exactly where the threats lurk, and you don't speak the language. Wouldn't it be nice to have a guide? Nurse Susan Gonzalez stopped a hospital nurse from giving her father a drug to which he is allergic. In many ways, a hospital is like that foreign land, and the guides that know the terrain are the nurses. As many as 98,000 people die in U.S. hospitals each year as a result of medical errors, according to an Institute of Medicine report. Some 99,000 people die each year from infections acquired in the hospital, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vigilance is key, says Cindy Sellers O'Brien, president of the mid-Maryland chapter of the Emergency Nurses Association. ""The patients that do better are the ones that take an active role in their health care. They have the better outcomes [because] they take more ownership."" The American Hospital Association agrees that patients play a crucial role. ""While we are striving for perfection in the way we deliver care, we know we fall short of that mark -- but patients can help us get better,"" says Nancy Foster, AHA's vice president for quality and patient safety policy. ""They can -- and should -- ask questions when something does not seem quite right."" The consequences of medical errors are especially devastating for children, according to the Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals nationwide. This week the commission released tips for keeping your child safe in the hospital, noting that according to its figures, one in 15 hospitalized children is harmed by medication errors. A study out last week from the University of Michigan found that nearly two-thirds of parents reported they felt the need to watch over their child's hospital care to make sure no one made any mistakes. Given the dangers lurking in hospitals, we asked several nurses to give us their suggestions about what steps to take to protect yourself and your family.  Watch more on avoiding hospital mistakes » . 1. Bring in a list of the medications you're taking . This is one of the most important things you can do to ensure your safety, according to a survey of 731 nurses by Consumer Reports. It's best to have the list in your wallet in case you're taken to the emergency room. Rita Kobert, a nurse in Fredericksburg, Virginia, who has a seizure disorder, told Consumer Reports she learned this lesson long ago. ""If I fall from a seizure ... and have to go to the hospital, I already have a printout of medications,"" she said. 2. Make sure the hospital gets your name right . Last year, Michelle Waddy, a freelance pediatric nurse practitioner in Roanoke, Virginia, suffered a drop in hemoglobin and needed four units of blood immediately. ""The emergency room nurse entered my name on the computer wrong. I was given blood under another patient's name,"" she wrote to us. Waddy says she caught the error, but the hospital continued to use the wrong name. ""Luckily they had to get my blood type before I was given blood, or I wouldn't be telling this story."" 3. Ask about every medication they give you . Nurses say to double-check the name, dosage, and timing of every medicine you receive in the hospital. Susan Gonzalez, a nurse in Austell, Georgia, caught a medication error just in time. She was visiting her father in the hospital when a nurse came to give him an intravenous medicine. ""I asked them, 'What are you hanging?' "" she said. The nurse answered it was ampicillin, an antibiotic. ""I was like, 'My dad is allergic,' and they said, 'Oh, you're right.' That could have been a fatal outcome."" 4. Make sure everyone washes hands . In the Consumer Reports survey, 26 percent of the nurses reported observing hand-washing lapses. ""It seems like a simple little thing, but doctors and nurses pick up a lot of nasty germs and then transmit them to other patients,"" Dr. Howard Blumstein told Consumer Reports. Blumstein is a vice president of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine and practices in North Carolina. Since it can be an uncomfortable conversation, Consumer Reports has a list of ways to ask a doctor or nurse to wash up. Here's advice on preventing hospital infections from the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the National Patient Safety Board. 5. If you think something's wrong, don't back down . O'Brien, the nurse from Maryland, said she had to fight to stop her mother from receiving a dangerous medication during an emergency visit to the hospital. She says her mother, who had breast cancer, was supposed to receive a dose of a steroid called Decadron before her chemotherapy sessions. She said someone in the hospital made a mistake and wrote in her mother's chart that she was supposed to receive Decadron every twelve hours. O'Brien begged the nurses to take her mother off the 12-hour schedule of Decadron, explaining that she was a diabetic and it could hurt her heart. Within 10 minutes of talking to the nurse, her mother experienced chest pain and had a heart attack, O'Brien recalls, adding that her mother survived. O'Brien says don't give up if you think something's wrong. ""You don't need to be aggressive, nasty, and mean. Be convincing and confident,"" she said. CNN's Sabriya Rice and Jennifer Pifer Bixler contributed to this report.","Medical errors kill up to 98,000 U.S. hospital patients a year .

Kossove, he learned, didn't let cancer -- in her lungs, chest and brain, and on her spinal cord and her vocal cord nerves -- get in the way of helping others. ""[I have] about 2,000 rare-cancer patients under my gimlet stare,"" Kossove wrote about the patients she communicated with on the Association of Cancer Online Resources, a Web site Frydman founded. ""I have had three deaths and another person dying in the last month among the people whom I advise. The last two current ones are breaking my heart."" Many of these patients say Kossove is the reason they're alive today. A Brooklyn, New York-born pediatrician who practiced in the United States and South Africa, she was found to have leiomyosarcoma, a rare and aggressive cancer, in 2001. She corresponded online with her fellow patients nearly every day -- sometimes all day -- until she died February 6. She was 65. ""I owe her my life,"" cancer patient Erica Gero wrote in tribute to Kossove on the ACOR Web site. Gero explained that Kossove convinced her to see a doctor who specialized in sarcomas, a move Gero said got her the treatment she needed. ""Doreen gritted her teeth and would not let go of me until I went to the right kind of doctor. She was polite, but snarky at the same time. And of course, she was right."" Read more tributes to Kossove . ""She was the most powerful patient advocate I've ever known,"" Frydman added. ""The world is missing a hero,"" wrote Chaim Kurz, whose wife, Adina, for eight years has been battling synovial sarcoma, a rare type of soft tissue cancer. Kurz writes under the alias 'Bruce Katz.' ""I remember at one time there was a question as to whether the tumors had spread into my wife's spinal cord or brain. We had nowhere to turn. Doreen was herself starting a new chemotherapy treatment and was extremely tired, but sent me a three-page e-mail explaining in detail what options we had,"" Kurz wrote on the ACOR site. ""She never candy-coated anything, but we knew that she loved everybody who ever asked her a question."" With a mother-hen style, Kossove pushed the cancer patients under her ""gimlet stare"" to hire the right doctor, fire the wrong doctor and find the latest treatments, which can be very difficult for rare cancers. She urged them to question doctors who told them there were no options left; she'd been told the same thing when her cancer was first diagnosed. ""When she joined the ACOR list in 2001, she was told she had one month to live,"" Frydman remembers. ""Her ability to be up on the latest research and to impart the knowledge was uncanny,"" wrote Susan Lowenbraun, nursing director of the Sarcoma Center at Cedars-Sinai Cancer Center in Los Angeles, California, who worked with Kossove to help patients on the ACOR site. ""Even when she felt ill herself, she did research and communicated tirelessly with other patients."" Sometimes Kossove showed impatience for others in her leiomyosarcoma group. If she felt someone wasn't moving quickly enough to fight LMS, which can spread at lightning speed, she let them know in very blunt terms. ""I get very exasperated, very bitter and very worried about the people on this list,"" she wrote to one woman. ""[Some of them] put their heads in the sand. ... If one has high-grade LMS, one has to hit the road running."" Kurz paid tribute to her forcefulness on the ACOR site. ""If she was in the U.S. Army or Navy, there would be peace in the world now -- that is how strong she was,"" he wrote. But she also showed great compassion, inspiring others on ACOR to keep searching for the newest treatment. ""Together we are more, and more effective, than we are separately,"" she often told her fellow cancer patients. Signing off on one message, she wrote, ""Celebrate being alive. Warmly, Doreen.""

"(CNN) -- You probably know Evan Handler as Harry Goldenblatt, Charlotte York's husband on HBO's ""Sex and the City,"" or as Charlie Runkle, the agent for David Duchovny's character on ""Californication."" What you probably don't know is that he's a passionate patient advocate, based on his experience being treated for leukemia in the mid- and late-1980s. Actor Evan Handler, currently appearing in ""Californication,"" defied statistics and survived leukemia. In many ways, Handler is the ultimate empowered patient. ""I learned that I must always remain in control, double-check everyone's work, and trust no one completely,"" Handler wrote of his approximately eight months in the hospital. ""I must have been sheer hell to be around. But I know that my cantankerousness saved my life on several occasions."" In his books ""It's Only Temporary,"" and ""Time on Fire,"" Handler wrote that during his months in the hospital, he was given intravenous drugs that were supposed to go to another patient, that nurses tried to give him medications his doctors had forbidden for him and that staff members refused to follow the hospital's posted hygiene precautions for immunosuppressed patients like himself. Handler survived when statistics said he shouldn't have. He endured round after round of chemotherapy, one infection after another and a bone marrow transplant. In this conversation with CNN Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, Handler discusses firing your doctor, tattooing medical directives on your stomach and the importance of not doing exactly what you're told.  Watch more on what you might gain from being a 'bad' patient » . Elizabeth Cohen: Were you a ""bad"" patient? Evan Handler: The irony of ""bad"" patients is that they actually do better for themselves. ... There were hundreds and hundreds of instances where my being a ""bad"" patient saved my life. Cohen: You write about how nurses tried to give you drugs to which you'd had ""horrendous adverse reactions"" even though doctors had explicitly written in your chart you shouldn't have those drugs. A friend of mine had a similar problem, and we decided maybe he should have hung a sign around his neck with a list of the drugs he wasn't supposed to get. Handler: That doesn't sound like a bad idea. [A doctor once told me about] a registered nurse who had a ""Do Not Resuscitate"" order tattooed on her abdomen. She said she felt it was the only way her wishes would be respected. Cohen: You write about how you became ""a criminal of sorts"" by forging your doctor's signature on authorization slips so your bloodwork would be done by a lab that ran the tests more quickly. Were you afraid you'd get caught? Handler: Nothing bad is going to happen to you if you don't do exactly as you're told. They weren't going to put me in jail. I worried about getting caught only because then I wouldn't be able to do it any more. Cohen: You describe your first doctor as being nasty, hostile and disrespectful. He yelled at your father for calling him on the phone with a question about your care. He yelled at you when you were in the middle of chemotherapy and came to see him with a rash and a fever because the fever was only 100 degrees. Did you wait too long to fire him? Handler: Oh, yeah. Doctors had told me that I would be endangering my care if I switched doctors, but that advice was criminal. Look, the only way to change things is through the marketplace. Recently I needed to have something in my mouth looked at. The doctor performed a biopsy without lidocaine -- just put a blade in my mouth and cut without telling me. I never went back, and I wrote him a three-page letter. You should leave a bad doctor, and if you have the energy, tell them why you left. Cohen: When you were being treated for leukemia, you were very, very sick. You said sometimes you were barely conscious. How'd you keep up the stamina to keep double-checking everyone's work? Handler: I was lucky to be able to maintain my strength and do it as long as I did, and my girlfriend at the time, Jackie, was willing to sit by my side and advocate for me, and she was very skilled at doing it. You wonder, how many people die from illnesses because the strength to keep up vigilance runs out?","Actor Evan Handler says ""bad"" patients do better for themselves .

"(CNN) --   Over the past week, I've been inundated with questions about swine flu, via Facebook, Twitter, CNN blogs and e-mail. So this week I'm empowering people with information about swine flu: how to protect yourself, what all the numbers mean and why you shouldn't freak out. The most recnt advice from the CDC is that non-essential travel to Mexico should be avoided. 1. Hasn't swine flu been around for a while? Yes. Swine flu was first identified in 1930 when researchers isolated the virus in a pig. In 1976, more than 200 soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey, got swine flu. From 1976 until 2005, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received approximately one report every year or two of humans with swine flu. From December 2005 until January 2009, there were 12 cases of swine flu reported. 2. The folks who have it now, did they get it from pigs or people? It appears that no one in the United States with swine flu had any contact with pigs. Dr. Richard Besser, the acting director of the CDC, said in a news conference Friday that among the first seven cases, no one had contact with pigs. In another press conference Monday, he added that investigators have looked to see whether any of the infected people had contact with pigs, and ""we're not finding that linkage here."" 3. Swine flu is transmitted from animals to humans. Does that happen a lot? Yes. More than 200 ""zoonotic diseases"" are transmitted from animals to humans, including illnesses caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. Rabies and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (better known as ""mad cow disease"") are two well-known examples. 4. Should I cancel my trip to Mexico? Yes, you should, unless it's essential. That's the advice from a recent CDC travel warning.  Watch Elizabeth Cohen answer your questions » . 5. Should I be freaking out? A new virus spreading quickly around the world. Young, healthy people struck dead in Mexico. Should we all be panicking? ""Absolutely not,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Swine flu, he said, ""is not spreading all that rapidly. Take the St. Francis School in New York. There's been very little transmission from the schoolchildren to family members, and it certainly hasn't spread throughout Queens."" iReport.com: Share your thoughts, concerns about swine flu . But, Schaffner added, this doesn't mean we shouldn't pay attention to swine flu. ""We should be alert, keep up with the information coming out daily, and take control by being attentive to your hygiene. Wash your hands very, very frequently and avoid people who are coughing and sneezing."" 6. How close do you have to be to a sick person to get swine flu? ""You can acquire this infection if you're within the 'breathing zone' of a sick person, which is about three to six feet,"" Schaffner said. ""And we usually mean being this close to someone in a confined space. We're not talking about fleeting contact. We're not talking about walking past someone in the street. You need sustained contact."" If you think you might have sustained contact with someone who's ill, read this guidance from the CDC's Web site. 7. Yikes! Every day I'm that close to countless people -- at work, on the bus, at church, in a movie theater. Could I get swine flu from them? Yes. ""If you're standing next to someone on a bus, or sitting next to someone or in front of someone in a theater, you could acquire the infection in that fashion,"" Schaffner said. That's why people with the symptoms of any kind of flu -- fever, diarrhea, body aches, vomiting, etc. -- are urged to stay home and away from groups of people. 8. Wasn't there a vaccine at one time? Is there one now? Yes, a swine flu vaccine was given to 45 million people in 1976. There is no vaccine now, although researchers are working on one. The 1976 vaccine wouldn't be helpful anyway, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy & Infectious Diseases. ""That was a completely different virus than the virus we are dealing with right now, completely different in the sense that the genes are different, and it doesn't have any relationship,"" said Fauci. ""The designation of each one was called the swine flu, but from a viral standpoint and spreading it is quite, quite different."" Here are two scientific articles about the swine flu outbreak and vaccination program in 1976: . •Reflections on the 1976 Swine Flu Vaccination Program . •Swine Influenza A Outbreak, Fort Dix, New Jersey, 1976 . 9. Many young, healthy people have become sick in the United States. Many of the dead in Mexico have been young and healthy. What's going on? Usually we think of flu as affecting the very young and the very old. This sometimes happens with new viruses. For example, in 1918 when a new flu virus emerged, many of those stricken were young and healthy. One theory is that young people, who have strong immune systems, mount a particularly vigorous response to new viruses. But there's a potential side effect to the response: the body releases dangerous levels of signaling proteins, called cytokines, which can damage the lungs. Scientists believe these ""cytokine storms"" can be fatal. Here is a scientific article about the proposed mechanism of cytokine storms. 10. Why are large numbers of people dying in Mexico, but not in other countries? This is the big mystery doctors are trying to solve right now. Many infectious disease experts say it's most likely a matter of numbers: with more illnesses in Mexico, there are also more deaths. Other explanations: that in Mexico people have, in addition to swine flu, other viruses that make for a more deadly combination than swine flu alone. It's also possible that the virus infecting the rest of the world is a weaker version than the one in Mexico. Among the swine flu mysteries: Why only deaths in Mexico? 11. Could this new swine flu virus have been manufactured by bioterrorists? That's the theory on some conspiracy theorists' Web sites. But experts don't believe it. ""If you were a bioterrorist you'd want to create something that's a lot more deadly than this,"" said Dr. Gerald Evans, an associate professor of microbiology at Queen's University in Canada. ""The problem with influenza is that the second you put it into people, it replicates and mutates very quickly. Even if you created the perfect bioweapon, within a few generations of transmissions, it wouldn't do what you planned for it to do."" 12. I get a flu shot every fall. Will that help protect me against swine flu? ""The short answer is that  the CDC says it's very unlikely,"" Schaffner said. But he said it might be possible. ""I think it's a bit of an open question whether repeated flu shots over years would provide a measure of protection."" 13. I was in Mexico two weeks ago. Could I have contracted swine flu, and the symptoms just haven't shown up yet? No. The incubation period of the swine flu is one to seven days. ""If you just traveled to Mexico and you're home and feeling well you should get on with your daily life and not worry about it,"" Evans said. 14. Can the swine flu virus live on inanimate objects? If someone with swine flu touches a doorknob, then I touch it, could I get swine flu? Flu viruses can live on inanimate surfaces. So theoretically, you could get swine flu from touching a doorknob that was just touched by an infected person. However, that's pretty unlikely, according to Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of epidemiology in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. ""I personally would not have a major fear of environmental contamination,"" he said. ""Virtually all influenza is transmitted from sneezing and coughing."" Schaffner agrees, adding that flu viruses don't survive in large numbers on surfaces. ""A doorknob isn't a warm, nourishing environment for a virus,"" he said. 15. What should I do if I develop symptoms of swine flu? Call your doctor -- don't just drive on over, Schaffner advised. ""Follow the instructions of your doctor. He might not want you in the waiting room spreading germs to others,"" he said. CNN Medical Producer John Bonifield contributed to this report.","The emergence of the swine flu has raised many questions; here are some answers .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Dr. Bernadine Healy can't even count the number of women who've complained to her about how tough it is to make the decision about hormone replacement therapy. A 2002 study found HRT made women more vulnerable to health problems including heart attacks and strokes. ""Women say, 'Oh it used to be so simple. Now it's so complex,'"" says Healy, a cardiologist and former director of the National Institutes of Health. ""And I tell them, 'Yes, it used to be so simple because it was wrong.'"" This is what she means: Before 2002, it was practically standard operating procedure to put women on synthetic hormones as soon as they reached menopause. (""We were putting them in the drinking water,"" jokes Healy.). But that turned out to be not such a great idea. A study in 2002 found that hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, made women more vulnerable to heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer and blood clots. In droves, doctors yanked their patients off the hormones. Six years later, Healy and others are pleading for a middle ground -- a world where doctors don't paint women with a broad brush, but instead consider the medical needs of each individual woman. The stumbling block to this middle ground is that patients often don't know what are good (and bad) reasons to go on HRT. And it's not just the patients who don't know. ""A lot of the doctors are confused as well,"" says Dr. Wulf Utian, executive director of the North American Menopause Society and a consultant in obstetrics and gynecology at the Cleveland Clinic. But there's some good news in this hormonal mess. Since 2002, a consensus has developed among the experts about legitimate and not-so-legitimate reasons for considering HRT. Here are the big five legitimate reasons: . 1. Hot flashes . If you have severe hot flashes, you're a good candidate for hormones, our experts say. ""They alleviate the problem by about 95 percent,"" Utian says. Many women -- probably about two-thirds -- have mild to moderate hot flashes and won't need hormones, he adds. ""Generally speaking, they can get away with layering clothing, avoiding spicy foods, breathing techniques or yoga."" 2. Night sweats . ""Night sweats are hot flashes when you're under blankets, so you can't get rid of the heat easily,"" Utian says. If night sweats are making you lose sleep to the point you're dysfunctional the next day, hormones might be a good option. ""Some women say, 'I can't live my life like this.' That's the woman who should not be denied the hormones,"" says Marcia Stefanick, professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center. Stefanick is co-author of a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that women who took a type of HRT called combined therapy (estrogen and progestin together) had a higher risk for breast cancer even three years after they quit taking the hormones. 3. Sleeplessness . The onset of menopause often gives women sleepless nights -- sometimes because of the night sweats, sometimes because of hormone changes. HRT sometimes helps, Healy says. 4. Osteoporosis -- sometimes . Studies have shown that HRT can cut down on bone fractures for women with osteoporosis, but it's not for everyone. ""A younger woman in early menopause who has osteoporosis -- or risk factors for osteoporosis -- might benefit from HRT,"" Utian says. ""Older women should use something else."" (See page 14 of this NIH report for other ways to treat osteoporosis.) Women are at high risk for osteoporosis if they're thin, have a family history of osteoporosis, are lactose intolerant or smoke. 5. You feel better on hormones . ""That's absolutely a legitimate reason for taking hormones,"" Healy says. ""You very often can't measure what makes a woman feel better. But just because you can't measure it doesn't mean it's not real."" It's important, however, that women who go on hormones for this reason -- or any reason -- understand the risks of hormones. ""I tell women, 'I'll give you the prescription as long as you understand the risks and the responsibilities and come in for regular checkups to see to it that all is going well,'"" Utian says. And what are some not-so-good reasons for going on HRT pills? Vaginal dryness and itchiness are better treated with estrogen creams, our experts say. Irregular periods should be tolerated, or treated with birth control pills, Utian says. And certainly don't go on HRT because you think it might prevent aging, heart disease or cancer. The NIH study in 2002 rejected those reasons. If you do decide to go on HRT, you need to keep several things in mind. First, take the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time. That second part is pretty fuzzy. ""The jury is still out. Is short-term two to three years? Five years?"" Stefanick says. ""When you go back to your doctor for checkups, ask, 'Should I go off it now?'"" Another question for your doctor: whether you should go on estrogen alone or combination therapy (estrogen plus progestin). Each has its pluses and minuses -- see Page 10 of the NIH document. Choosing the right doctor is obviously of the utmost importance. Utian recommends an obstetrician-gynecologist rather than an internist. He recommends asking doctors how often they deal with hormone issues. ""Some obstetricians are so busy delivering babies, they won't be spending much time on hormones,"" he says. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Thirty states are reporting high levels of flu-like illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number is a slight uptick from last week's report. All but two states are reporting widespread flu activity, according to the CDC. ""Widespread"" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. It addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity. The new report uses data collected by the CDC up through January 12. The overall number of people being treated in outpatient facilities appears to be going down, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the CDC's director. However, in the West, where the flu season started later, the number of cases is expected to grow. Hospitalizations for the elderly have also gone up significantly, according to the report. About 90% of flu-related deaths occur in those over 65. The CDC expects the number of hospitalizations and deaths to continue to rise. ""It's a worse than average (flu) season, and it's a bad year for the elderly,"" Frieden said. Nine additional pediatric deaths have been reported since last week, bringing the total since the flu season began to 29. The CDC does not count the number of flu-related adult deaths. The United States is about halfway through the typical 12-week flu season, Frieden said, but the agency is not sure when it will peak. ""The only thing predictable about the flu is, it's unpredictable."" Vaccination . The flu vaccine is far from perfect -- it's about 62% effective this year -- but it's the best prevention tool there is, Frieden said. Despite reports of shortages of the flu shot, vaccine manufacturers CNN last week plenty is available for those who want it. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a vaccine from seven manufacturers, according to Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the FDA commissioner, who ""collectively produced 145 million doses"" of flu vaccine for this season. ""This is twice the supply that was available only several years ago,"" Hamburg said. Genentech, which makes the antiviral drug known as Tamiflu Oral Suspension, had reported temporary delays in new shipments, but it is working with the FDA to release its reserve stock. The packaging on this reserve medication may appear different even though the drug is the same. ""With the addition of these reserve supplies, we anticipate having sufficient supply of Tamiflu capsules to meet demand for this flu season,"" a Genentech statement said. Given within the first couple of days of infection, Tamiflu OS can ease flu symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness. The drug is typically prescribed for children younger than 13 or for people who have trouble swallowing pills. Common flu vaccine misconceptions . If you get the flu . The type of flu going around this year is called H3N2. People are more likely to get complications from this particular strain, which could make them ill for a longer period of time. If you get the flu, don't panic, said Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Most patients should not go to an emergency room. Just get plenty of rest and take painkillers to help with muscle aches, Zich said. Symptoms typically last up to seven days for a normal flu infection. There are scenarios in which going to a hospital is necessary. If a patient is short of breath or can't keep fluids down because of nausea, these are signs of a problem that needs immediate attention, Zich said. Excessive vomiting or sweating from fever can lead to dehydration, which is serious and requires treatment. Very young children, senior citizens and people with underlying health conditions should also see their doctor, the CDC's Frieden said. They are the populations most susceptible to serious illness. ""Rapid treatment in the first 48 hours can make a big difference,"" he said. What to do if you have the flu .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Jack Rodman's heart sank when he heard the news: One of his elderly patients with a heart condition had a stroke because she couldn't afford the medicines he'd prescribed her. Increasingly, Americans are finding it harder to afford their prescription medications. ""She went cold turkey and stopped taking all of them,"" said Rodman, an internist at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida. ""What's so sad is that she assumed that since some of her medicines were expensive, all of them were. If she'd just kept taking her Coumadin [a blood thinner], which is like $5 a month, she likely wouldn't have had the stroke."" Rodman says this woman isn't his only patient who, faced with tough economic times, has stopped taking his or her medications. ""There are lots of examples of this, and I fear there will be more,"" he said. A new report from Consumer Reports finds that many Americans are having trouble affording their prescription drugs and have taken dangerous steps as a result. The survey, released this week, found that 28 percent of Americans have taken steps such as not filling prescriptions, skipping dosages and cutting pills in half without the approval of their doctor, and even sharing prescriptions with a friend. ""The cost of health care is leading consumers to cut corners in ways that are potentially dangerous,"" said Dr. John Santa, director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center. Prices for prescription drugs are skyrocketing. In 2007, Americans spent $287 billion on prescription drugs, about five times as much as in 1993, according to Consumer Reports. If you think you're immune from these price increases because you have prescription drug insurance, think again. In 2002, Consumer Reports found that 65 percent of the drugs they surveyed were mostly or entirely covered by insurance. When they asked about the same drugs in 2008, only 33 percent were covered mostly or entirely, and 5 percent of purchases weren't covered at all. Read Consumer Reports' article: America's best drugstores . The good news, Santa says, is that there are ways for everyone to save money on prescription drugs. Here are 10 tips. The first one might have kept Rodman's patient from having a stroke.  Watch more on how to save money at the pharmacy » . 1. Tell your doctor you can't afford the drugs he's prescribing. According to the Consumer Reports survey, only 4 percent of those polled said they'd had a conversation with their doctors about the cost of a drug. You shouldn't hesitate to talk to your doctor about prices; these days, many people can't afford the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs. ""There's such an embarrassment level,"" Rodman said. ""They stop taking the drugs, and they never tell me why."" 2. Ask your doctor whether there's a generic that would work just as well. It's amazing how much money you can save with this one little question. For example, if your doctor prescribes Lunesta, a sleeping pill, you could end up paying about $93 for 15 doses. Switch to zolpidem, which is the generic form of Ambien, and you'll pay $33 for the same number of doses, according to Consumer Reports Best Buy Drugs. To make it really easy, bring in a list of the $4 generics sold at your local pharmacy and hand it to your doctor. If there isn't a generic that will work for your particular problem, ask whether there might be a less-expensive brand name available. Santa suggests wording it like this: ""Can you tell me about other options that would cost me less?"" 3. Ask the pharmacist for less-expensive alternatives. If you didn't get a good answer from your doctor, ask your pharmacist whether there's a less-expensive drug in the same class as the one your doctor prescribed. 4. Use mail order. You'll save money. Of course, this won't work when you need medicines immediately (for example, antibiotics for an infection), but mail order often works well for medicines you need to take long-term. 5. Find a prescription assistance program. There are several out there to help people who can't afford their prescription drugs. Consumer Reports has advice on choosing a prescription assistance plan. 6. Be suspicious of free samples. Samples are indeed enticing. But what a lot of people don't know is that samples are often for the most expensive drugs on the market. Although the samples will help you out for a month or two, after that, you'll have to start forking over the big bucks by yourself. For more information, see this Empowered Patient on free samples. 7. Don't push for what you see on TV. Just as samples are often for the pricey drugs, TV commercials are also often for pricey drugs -- and drugs that don't necessarily work any better than cheaper alternatives. If you ask for what you see on TV, there's a chance your doctor might prescribe it -- and you'll get sticker shock at the pharmacy. 8. Split drugs with caution. Sometimes you really can save money by asking your doctor to prescribe a double dosage of a drug and then splitting the pills in half. But there are safe and unsafe ways to split drugs, and some drugs should never be split at all. See Consumer Report's guidance on splitting drugs. There's a flip side to this. Let's say you're taking 10mg of a drug, and it's not working, so your doctor ups your dose to 20 mg. Don't take two of the 10mg pills, warns Dr. Robert Epstein, chief medical officer at Medco, a prescription drug insurance company. That'll end up costing you money, because you'll go through your drugs twice as fast. ""Instead, ask for a single pill that has the higher strength,"" Epstein advised. 9. If you don't have insurance, shop around. Pharmacies sometimes charge very different prices for the same drugs. In fact, Consumer Reports found that prices for the same bottle of pills can vary by more than $100. 10. Ask for a review. You may be taking medicines you don't need, especially if you see a variety of doctors who don't talk to one another about what they're prescribing. ""Bring your drugs in to one doctor and say, 'Do I need to be taking all these?' "" Epstein said. If you've tried to talk to your doctor about prices and received a confused look, it's worth trying again, Rodman says, because the bad economy has forced doctors to become more knowledgeable about saving money for their patients. ""Two years ago, I couldn't tell you the cost of most of the medicines I prescribed,"" Rodman said. ""Now I can.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Five years ago, Kathye Petters-Armitage's first child received the exact vaccinations on the exact schedule recommended by her pediatrician. Hannah Polling's autism was found to be ""significantly aggravated"" by her childhood vaccines. But when she gave birth to her second child, Petters-Armitage had a change of heart. In the intervening two years, she'd read a lot about concerns that vaccines cause autism and decided to ask her pediatrician to give her new baby fewer shots spread out over a longer period of time. ""I wasn't a hundred percent convinced there was a link between autism and vaccines,"" said Petters-Armitage, of Santa Clarita, California. ""But I didn't want to be one of those parents who found out the hard way."" Pediatricians say they've seen a dramatic increase in the number of parents who, like Petters-Armitage, want to make changes in the vaccine schedule set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics, a schedule once considered by many pediatricians to be sacred and largely immutable.  Watch more on making decisions about your children's shots » . Many of these doctors say even though they might disagree with these parents, they are making changes. ""If a parent says no to an intervention, including a vaccination, I have to accept that,"" said Dr. Arthur Lavin, a pediatrician in Beachwood, Ohio, and associate clinical professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. ""I share with them what I know, but ultimately, it's the parent's decision."" Dr. Kenneth Bock, a clinical instructor in the department of family medicine at Albany Medical College in New York, put it this way: ""It shouldn't be my way or the highway. We can't say one size fits all. One size doesn't fit all."" In an article on CNN.com in March, two CDC doctors wrote, ""Although some may call it a 'one size fits all' approach, the recommended vaccine schedule is flexible."" The following is a list of vaccine changes that parents have requested and that some pediatricians have agreed to make. It does not include a discussion of the pros and cons to each approach, or a discussion of whether vaccines and autism are even linked, but rather a list of some approaches being used by some pediatricians and parents. 1. Delaying the first hepatitis B shot . Currently, newborns receive hepatitis B shots before they're discharged from the hospital. ""I've never understood why we give this at birth,"" said Dr. Richard Frye, assistant professor of pediatrics and neurology at the University of Texas Medical Center at Houston. Hepatitis B is spread by having sex with an infected partner, by sharing needles, by sharing razors or toothbrushes with an infected person or by contact with blood or open sores of an infected person. ""I don't know babies who have sex or share needles,"" said Dr. David Traver, a pediatrician in private practice in Foster City, California. Lavin says that instead of giving the hepatitis B shot at birth, he routinely gives it when a baby is 2 months old. One exception: If a mother carries hepatitis B, her baby must receive the vaccine and treatment for hepatitis B infection. 2. Not doing some shots at all . The pediatricians interviewed for this article were unanimous on this point: Not all diseases are created equal. Some diseases for which children are vaccinated are easier to catch than others, and some are more deadly. For example, Petters-Armitage told her doctor she wasn't as worried about chicken pox or rotavirus as she was about diseases like polio and pertussis. Even though she says he disagreed with her, he abided by her wishes and didn't give her second and third children vaccinations for chicken pox and rotavirus. The pediatricians interviewed for this article advise parents that if they're concerned, they should sit down and discuss with their pediatricians the severity of each disease before proceeding with vaccinations. 3. Checking for 'titers' before giving booster shots . For many vaccines, such as chicken pox, children receive boosters to ""boost"" the immunity received from a previous shot. Some children, however, might not need the booster because they had an adequate immune response to the first shot. Pediatricians sometimes will do a blood test to check a child's titers. ""Checking titers"" refers to measuring the amount of antibodies in the blood, an indication of whether the person is immune to a certain disease. Checking titers isn't routine and sometimes is not covered by insurance. ""If you came to me and said you wanted to check titers, and you'll pay for it, would I do that for you? I would,"" said Dr. Laura Jana, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics. 4. Spreading the vaccines out over a longer period of time . This is the hallmark of the Sears Schedule, an alternative vaccine schedule developed by pediatrician Dr. Robert Sears. Sears' patients bring their babies in for shots seven times between the ages of 2 to 9 months, never receiving more than two shots at each visit. Under the CDC schedule, children come in three times during that age range, receiving sometimes five shots at one visit. 5. Splitting up combined shots . Several vaccinations are combined into one shot. For example, measles, mumps and rubella are put together into one injection called MMR, and diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis are put together into one shot called DTaP. MMR is available as three injections, but most doctors don't have them. If you want to separate out these shots, you may have to get a prescription and find a pharmacy that will order them for you and then give them to the doctor for injection. Some doctors do offer the shots separately. Sears gives measles, mumps and rubella shots separately and at three different ages. Lavin said he's received so many requests to separate out the MMR, he's ordered the separate shots. Pertussis is not available separately, so even doctors like Sears, who offer an alternative schedule, give the DTaP shot. The pediatricians we talked to said the key is to talk to your doctor about whether an alternative schedule is best. ""It's a talk. It's a whole appointment,"" Traver said. ""Call the receptionist and say you'd like to make an appointment with the doctor to discuss immunizations."" Another consideration: what's best for your child. For example, in the case of Hannah Poling, the federal government found that vaccines she received as a toddler ""significantly aggravated"" an underlying illness that predisposed her to symptoms of autism. The ""vaccine court"" ordered that her family be compensated financially. It's not entirely clear what family history would put your child at risk for vaccine problems, but Frances Page Glascoe, a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says parents should look back at least ask the question. ""I would look at Mom, Dad, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins who had developmental disabilities, including language disorders and autism spectrum disorder,"" she said. If parents find such a family history, ""that would cause me to discuss an alternative vaccination schedule."" Jon Poling, Hannah's father, says it's clear to him now that he should have been more wary. ""We have autoimmune disorders on both sides of the family, and Hannah had multiple febrile infections with ear infections and horrible trouble with eczema,"" he said. ""All of those are red flags that a child is at risk."" CNN associate archive coordinator Sarah Edwards contributed to this report.","Parents have concerns about possible vaccine and autism link .

"Empowered Patient is a regular feature from CNN Medical News correspondent Elizabeth Cohen that helps put you in the driver's seat when it comes to health care. Studies have shown that acupuncture can ease pain, but researchers aren't sure of the exact mechanism. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Dr. Andrew Weil wasn't sure exactly how he hurt his knee; all he knew was that it was painful. But instead of turning to cortisone shots or heavy doses of pain medication, Weil turned to the ancient Chinese medicine practice of acupuncture. ""It worked -- my knee felt much better,"" says Weil. Americans spend billions of dollars each year on alternative medicine, everything from chiropractic care to hypnosis. Weil says alternative medicine can work wonders -- acupuncture, certain herbs, guided imagery. For example, Dr. Brian Berman, director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, has done a series of studies showing acupuncture's benefits for osteoarthritis of the knee. Extensive studies have also been done on mind-body approaches such as guided imagery, and on some herbs, including St. John's wort. But on the other hand, there also is a lot of quackery out there, Weil says. ""I've seen it all, [including] products that claim to increase sexual vigor, cure cancer and allay financial anxiety."" So how do you know what works and what doesn't when it comes to alternative medicine? Just a decade ago, there weren't many well-done, independent studies on herbs, acupuncture, massage or hypnosis, so patients didn't have many facts to guide them. But in 1999, eight academic medical centers, including Harvard, Duke and Stanford, banded together with the purpose of encouraging research and education on alternative medicine. Eight years later, the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine has 38 member universities, and has gathered evidence about what practices have solid science behind them. Here, from experts at five of those universities, are five alternative medicine practices that are among the most promising because they have solid science behind them. 1. Acupuncture for pain . Hands, down, this was the No. 1 recommendation from our panel of experts. They also recommended acupuncture for other problems, including nausea after surgery and chemotherapy. 2. Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B6 for PMS . When pre-menstrual syndrome rears its ugly head, gynecologist Dr. Tracy Gaudet encourages her patients to take these dietary supplements. ""They can have a huge impact on moodiness, bloating, and on heavy periods,"" says Gaudet, who's the executive director of Duke Integrative Medicine at Duke University Medical School. 3. St. John's Wort for depression . The studies are a bit mixed on this one, but our panel of experts agreed this herb -- once thought to rid the body of evil spirits - is definitely promising. ""It's worth a try for mild to moderate depression,"" says Weil, founder and director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona. ""Remember it will take six to eight weeks to see an effect."" Remember, too, that St. John's wort can interfere with some medicines; the University of Maryland Medical Center has a list. 4. Guided imagery for pain and anxiety . ""Go to your happy place"" has become a cliché, but our experts say it really works. The technique, of course, is more complicated than that. ""In guided imagery we invite you to relax and focus on breathing and transport you mentally to a different place,"" says Mary Jo Kreitzer, Ph.D., R.N., founder and director of the Center for Spirituality and Healing at the University of Minnesota. There's a guided imagery demo at the University of Minnesota's Web site. 5. Glucosamine for joint pain . ""It's safe, and it looks like it's effective,"" says Dr. Frederick Hecht, director of research at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. ""It may be the first thing that actually reverses cartilage loss in osteoarthritis."" All our experts warn that since alternative medicine is financially lucrative, a lot of charlatans have gotten into the business. They have these tips for being a savvy shopper: . 1. Look for ""USP"" or ""NSF"" on the labels . ""The biggest mistake people make is they don't get a good product,"" says Dr. Mary Hardy, medical director of the Sims/Mann-UCLA Center for Integrative Oncology. She says the stamp of approval from the United States Pharmacopoeia or NSF International, two groups with independent verification programs, means what's on the label is in the product. 2. Find a good practitioner . Make sure the alternative medicine practitioner you're going to is actually trained to practice alternative medicine. One place to start is the Consortium for Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine . 3. Be wary of crazy claims . ""Anything that sounds too good to be true probably is,"" says Weil. And once you do start on your journey with alternative medicine, here's a piece of advice: Take it slow. Alternative medicine works, but sometimes not as quickly as taking a drug. ""I tell people it's going to take a while,"" says Hardy. ""I tell them to do a six- to eight-week trial, or even 12 weeks."" E-mail to a friend . Elizabeth Cohen is a correspondent with CNN Medical News.","A number of alternative medical practices have solid science behind them .

"(CNN) --   Connie and Donald McCracken were watching CNN one evening last week when they learned of the tragic death of actress Natasha Richardson from a head injury. Immediately, their minds turned to their 7-year-old daughter, Morgan, who was upstairs getting ready for bed. An injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death. Two days earlier, Morgan, her father, and brother had been playing baseball in the yard of their Mentor, Ohio, home when her father hit a line drive that landed just above Morgan's left temple. A lump formed, but the McCrackens iced it down and the swelling subsided within an hour. ""For the next two days, she was perfectly fine,"" Donald McCracken says. ""She had no symptoms. She went to school both days and got an A on her spelling test as usual. There were no issues whatsoever."" But after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed. After all, Richardson had been talking and lucid immediately after her fatal injury. When they went upstairs to kiss Morgan good night, she complained of a headache. ""Because of Natasha, we called the pediatrician immediately. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,"" McCracken says. The McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side. ""I knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to Cleveland in an ambulance,"" McCracken said. When the helicopter arrived at Rainbow, the McCrackens were greeted by Dr. Alan Cohen, the hospital's chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma. McCracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him. ""My heart sank,"" he says. ""It just sank."" Unlike Richardson's, Morgan's story has a happy ending. After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine. ""Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up,"" McCracken says. Now the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor. After hearing about Richardson's death, many people are asking themselves the same question: Do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor? ""Sometimes there's a gray zone, and there's no right answer,"" Cohen says.  Watch for tips on when to go to the ER » . In most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. ""They're confused, they're agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,"" he says. But then there's what doctors call the ""talk and die"" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later. ""Talk and die"" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. ""Fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. Something's got to give, and that something is the brain,"" Ayotte says. If you don't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, ""the deterioration can happen very quickly."" Here, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury. 1. Be vigilant . Keep an eye on someone who has hit his head, even if the person never lost consciousness. ""A lot of folks are still under the assumption that as long as you're not knocked out, you're OK, and that's not true,"" Ayotte says. 2. Look for dizziness, vomiting, headache and confusion . If the injured person has these signs, take him or her to an emergency room, says Dr. Jam Ghajar, clinical professor of neurological surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, and president of the Brain Trauma Foundation. 3. Look for changes in symptoms and behavior . Any sudden change, such as Morgan's headache going from mild to severe in minutes, means the person needs medical attention. For example, Ghajar says, if a person gets suddenly sleepy in the first 12 hours after a hit, it may mean the parts of the brain responsible for staying awake are experiencing pressure from a bleed. 4. Be especially wary if someone a) has been drinking alcohol, b) is on blood thinners, c) is elderly or d) is a young athlete . It's tough to distinguish brain-injured behavior from drunken behavior, so when in doubt, take the person to the hospital, Ghajar says. Also, blood thinners can turn a mild bleed into a major bleed, so be especially vigilant if the injured person is taking blood thinners such as warfarin. He also warns people to be extra vigilant when an elderly person hits his or her head. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has information on traumatic brain injury and senior citizens. The CDC also has information on concussions in young athletes. 5. Go to a certified trauma center if you can . The American College of Surgeons has a list of certified trauma facilities; a hospital that's not a trauma center may not have a neurosurgeon on call. You can also look on this map from the American Trauma Society. Find your state, select trauma centers, update the map, and you can find information about trauma centers in your area. The McCrackens say they look back and still can't believe Morgan suffered such a severe injury and didn't show any signs for 48 hours. ""She didn't black out, her speech wasn't slurred, she wasn't dizzy, she wasn't any of the things you'd expect,"" McCracken says. ""And you don't want to be one of those panicky parents who takes their child to the emergency room all the time."" Cohen's advice after a head injury: When in doubt, go. ""It's always better to err on the side of being conservative,"" he says. CNN Medical Producer Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","Richardson's death raises question: When should you go to ER after head injury?

"(CNN) -- He is Manchester United's man for all seasons. As a mainstay of the team that won 13 Premier League titles and two European Cups under retired manager Alex Ferguson, Ryan Giggs provides a vital link to United's illustrious recent past. During 23 years with the Old Trafford club, he has continually reinvented himself to remain a key figure in English football's most successful team. From a pacey winger in the early 1990s to a yoga-practicing 21st century professional, Giggs' status as a revered veteran of United's golden age made him the only logical choice to step into the managerial hotseat vacated prematurely by Ferguson's replacement David Moyes last month. Giggs was appointed manager on an interim basis, his four-game spell in the dugout coming to an end with Sunday's trip to Southampton. The 40-year-old's playing contract also expires in June, meaning for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century, the club could be absent from the life of Ryan. Current Dutch national team coach Louis van Gaal is the man expected to take control of United on a full-time basis, but whether the former Ajax boss will retain the services of Giggs as a player or a coach is unclear. In a press conference last week Giggs hinted that, should Van Gaal arrive as is widely expected, he could pursue a coaching career at another club. But for one former member of Ferguson's coaching staff, retaining the services of Giggs is essential if United are to bounce back from failing to qualify for the European Champions League for the first time since 1995. ""What's important is that Ryan stays at Old Trafford,"" Rene Meulensteen, who was Ferguson's assistant manager at United between 2007 and 2013, told CNN. Blog: Is Man Utd the impossible job? Meulensteen, who was sacked as manager of Fulham in February, thinks Giggs is a figure of such stature within football that he could afford to skip a couple of rungs on the career ladder. ""I don't think he should go and manage a club in the Championship (English football's second tier), for example,"" he explained. ""Ryan is an exception to that rule."" It is a common refrain within the game that great players don't necessarily make great coaches. Argentine Diego Maradona, for example, is rated by many as the finest footballer of all time but as a coach he struggled in charge of his native Argentina. A counter to such perceived wisdom is Maradona's compatriot Diego Simeone, who was well-regarded as a combative midfielder and is now on the brink of leading Atletico Madrid to a Champions League and Spanish title double. ""It would be a transition both for the club and Ryan but you have to give it time,"" said Meulensteen when asked if Giggs should be appointed on a full-time contract. ""Giving Ryan the job provides the chance to re-establish the Alex Ferguson dynasty. That is the only way to do it if the club wants to try that route. ""But if they go for Van Gaal, Ryan can learn from him."" By spending almost his entire playing career under Ferguson, Giggs had the opportunity to learn from a giant of the game. The principles ingrained in Giggs by the ruthless Scot, who brought the curtain down on his own career in May 2013, could serve him well should he inherit his mentors old job in the near -- or distant -- future. ""All his life Ryan has shown he can manage his position on the playing field, but now he has to show he can manage everyone's position at the club,"" added Meulensteen, reflecting on Giggs' credentials. ""He has to decide what team to pick and what tactics to use -- he has to drop people that he has played with. But again I don't see him having a problem with that. ""Most important -- can he manage the training? Ferguson always stressed that what you do in training manifests itself in matches."" If what Giggs achieved as a player manifests itself during his coaching career, United fans could have a lot to look forward to.","Ryan Giggs' spell as interim Man Utd manager ends on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Former English Premier League referees have jumped to the defense of Howard Webb after criticism of his performance in Sunday's World Cup final. Webb, the first referee to officiate the European Champions League final and World Cup final in the same season, dished out 13 yellow cards and one red as Spain defeated the Netherlands 1-0 in a tempestuous clash at Soccer City, Johannesburg. Dutch coach Bert Van Marwijk and several of his players suggested the English official favored the Spanish, and Netherlands fans booed Webb and his assistants when they collected their medals after the game. But ex-referee Jeff Winter, who took charge of several fiery encounters between English giants like Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, was full of praise for Webb's performance in extremely testing circumstances. ""I thought he had a superb game,"" Winter told CNN. ""I find it very difficult to remember a more testing game than that at any level. I thought the players' behavior and discipline were abysmal. ""It was as if the Dutch had decided the only way they were going to stop Spain was by kicking them, harassing the referee and being obnoxious throughout. ""From a referee's point of view, if the players don't want to be controlled it's virtually impossible to control them. Had it had been a referee without his experience of the European game, they might have lost control within the first 30 minutes."" Webb's tally of 14 yellow cards -- including the red shown to Netherlands defender Johnny Heitinga in extra-time - was a record for the World Cup final. Players from both sides flew into challenges from the first whistle and Dutch midfielder Nigel De Jong was fortunate to escape with only a yellow for a chest-high kick on Spain's Xabi Alonso. ""Howard will never, ever, if he lives to be 100, referee a tougher match,"" Dermot Gallagher, another former Premier League referee, told Sky Sports News. ""If you take the De Jong tackle out -- I thought that was a red card -- other than that I don't think he's got much to really look back in anger at himself, because he's gone out, he's been tested to the absolute limit."" FIFA president Sepp Blatter also defended Webb's performance, stating that it was ""not easy"" to control such a match. ""It's not up to me to judge the performances of the officials, I can only say it was a very hard task that the referee trio had on the field of play,"" he told reporters in Johannesburg. The defeat was the Netherlands' third in a World Cup final, and several of the players made Webb the target of their frustration. The official declined to dismiss Spain center-back Carles Puyol for a tug on Arjen Robben as he bore down on goal in the second half and failed to award a corner to the Dutch when a free-kick was deflected wide shortly before Spain's goal. ""There were some strange decisions and for me, honestly, if you play a World Cup final, you need a world-class referee,"" Robben said, the U.K. Press Association reported. Van Marwijk said Webb had not controlled the match, while Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt said: ""I know you cannot blame others, but the referee favored Spain."" Winter, Webb's room-mate when he joined the Premier League circuit in 2003, has no sympathy for the Dutch. ""To listen to Dutch players after the game blaming the referee for the defeat after they conducted themselves abysmally for the whole two hours is unbelievable,"" he said. ""I hope when they look back at what they've said they are totally and utterly embarrassed.""","Former referees defend Howard Webb's performance in World Cup final .

"(CNN)  -- The robust approach of the Netherlands side in the World Cup final has drawn a fierce rebuke from Dutch legend Johan Cruyff, who accused them of ""dirty"" play and adopting ""anti-football"" tactics. Cruyff was the star player of the revered Dutch team of the 1974 World Cup that introduced the concept ""total football"" to the world. Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt were the Oranje's outfield players from their starting 11 not to be booked by referee Howard Webb, while Johnny Heitinga saw red in extra-time for a second bookable offence as Spain won 1-0 at Soccer City on Sunday. Cruyff, who coached Barcelona after his playing days were over, believes Nigel de Jong and Mark van Bommel were very fortunate to avoid red cards for challenges in the first half. Manchester City midfielder De Jong, in particular, has come under criticism for his ""kung-fu"" style challenge which left Xabi Alonso nursing bruised ribs. ""Regrettably, sadly, they played very dirty. So much so that they should have been down to nine immediately, they made two ugly and hard tackles that even I felt the damage,"" wrote Cruyff. ""This ugly, vulgar, hard, hardly eye-catching, lack of football style served the Dutch to unsettle Spain. If with this they got satisfaction, fine, but they ended up losing. ""Some practiced anti-football considering that it was the only way to survive. It finished 0-0 (after regulation play) because they (Spain) could not play as they wanted."" Referee Webb also comes under criticism for failing to act tougher as he handed out a string of yellow cards without using the ultimate sanction until Heitinga was sent off deep into extra-time. ""You can referee badly, but what you cannot do is create your own type of justice and, worse, invent a personal application of the rules,"" Cruyff said. ""Not only did he fail to expel two Dutchmen, including (Arjen) Robben who deserved the second yellow, he also looked the other way at times in which he had to get involved. ""A World Cup final deserves a big referee, but above all, it deserves a referee who dares to do everything it means to be judge."" Cruyff was named man of the tournament at the 1974 World Cup, but his team lost the final 2-1 to West Germany. He did not play in the 1978 World Cup where the Dutch again lost in the final to Argentina.","Dutch legend Johan Cruyff critical of their robust approach in World Cup final .

"(CNN) -- Uruguay striker Diego Forlan has won the FIFA Golden Ball award for the top player of the 2010 World Cup after inspiring his country to its best performance at the global showpiece in 40 years. Forlan, who plays for Spanish club Atletico Madrid, scored five goals as Uruguay reached the semifinals in South Africa. The 1930 and 1950 World Cup winners finished in fourth place after losing Saturday's playoff against Germany. Forlan polled 23.4 percent of votes cast by journalists covering the World Cup, to finish ahead of Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder (21.8 percent) and Spain striker David Villa (16.9%). ""It's as great as it is unexpected,"" Forlan told governing body FIFA's website, revealing that his teammates reacted to his award by throwing him in the hotel swimming pool. ""I never even imagined something like this, nor did I have my sights set on it. I'm enjoying it and I'm delighted but I'm very aware that it's the result of the spectacular tournament the team has had."" Forlan ended a disappointing spell with England's Manchester United in 2005 to move to Spain, where he has twice finished as the league's top scorer. He became the 2010 World Cup's joint leading scorer with a spectacular volley on Saturday before striking the bar from a free-kick in the dying moments of Germany's 3-2 victory. Forlan's tally of five goals left him level with Sneijder, Villa and Thomas Muller, but the German forward claimed the Golden Boot award because he racked up a higher number of assists (three) than the others. Muller, 20, who was instrumental in Germany's 4-1 demolition of England and the 4-0 thrashing of Argentina, was also voted the tournament's best young player. He was suspended for the semifinal as Germany lost 1-0 to Spain but returned to score his fifth goal of the competition in the third-place playoff. As well as the World Cup trophy, Spain will also fly home on Monday with the FIFA Fair Play Award after collecting only eight yellow cards in the tournament. Spain's Iker Casillas was awarded the Golden Glove prize for the best goalkeeper after conceding just two goals in the tournament.","Uruguay's Diego Forlan wins Golden Ball award for World Cup's best player .

"(CNN) -- Three-time champions Germany finished third for the second successive World Cup after coming from behind to defeat Uruguay 3-2 in Port Elizabeth on Saturday night. Sami Khedira headed the winning goal with eight minutes to play as Joachim Low's much-changed team won the bronze-medal match in South Africa. ""Of course we had all hoped for something better, but this match for third place was also a final that we absolutely wanted to win,"" Khedira said, AFP reported. ""At this World Cup we were a very young team and we've put down a marker. But we obviously want to win more in the future."" Thomas Muller put Germany ahead in the 19th minute on his return from suspension after missing the semifinal defeat by Spain, joining the tournament's top scorers with his fifth goal of the competition. Edinson Cavani leveled nine minutes later after Germany's stand-in captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was dispossessed, and two-time champions Uruguay took the lead six minutes after the halftime interval as Diego Forlan also netted his fifth goal with a superb volley. Germany equalized five minutes later when Marcell Jansen headed home after Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera failed to cut out Jerome Boateng's deep cross. Forlan hit the German crossbar with the final play of the match from a stunning free-kick as the South Americans finished the tournament on a losing note. ""Finishing among the top four teams is spectacular,"" he said. ""At the beginning we never thought we'd taste a moment like this. We wanted to finish third, but we'll remember the positives."" Low left captain Philipp Lahm and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on the substitutes' bench along with four-goal striker Miroslav Klose, who had been struggling with a back injury and missed out on the chance to join Brazil's Ronaldo as the all-time top World Cup scorer on 15 overall. Lahm's replacement Dennis Aogo was lucky not to be sent off for a bad early tackle on Diego Perez, but Germany had the ascendancy as Arne Friedrich headed Mezut Ozil's corner against the Uruguay crossbar in the 10th minute. The 20-year-old Muller made no mistake as he pounced to score the opening goal after Muslera was deceived by Schweinsteiger's swerving shot and could only spill the ball into the German's path. It put the Bayern Munich player, who has represented his country only eight times, on five goals for the tournament along with Spain's David Villa and Wesley Sneijder of the Netherlands. If that duo fail to score in Sunday's final, Muller may win the award for top scorer as -- bizarrely -- assists are taken into account in the case of a tie, and he has three to their one. But Schweinsteiger turned villain soon after when he was dispossessed by Perez, who fed Luis Suarez -- and the Uruguay striker found Cavani with a well-timed pass which left veteran goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt exposed. Suarez, returning from suspension, was booed by large sections of the crowd almost every time he touched the ball due to his deliberate handling on the line against Ghana in the quarterfinals. With rain lashing down, he should have put Uruguay ahead just before halftime but screwed his shot wide of the post. The 36-year-old Butt, whose third and previous international outing was in 2003, did well to deny Cavani and Suarez after the break but could do nothing as Forlan volleyed in a right-wing cross from Egidio Arevalo Rios in the 51st minute. The lead did not last long as Muslera was once again caught out, allowing Jansen a free header after flailing at Boateng's towering right-wing center. Khedira gave 2002 runners-up Germany the lead in the 82nd minute as Uruguay failed to clear Ozil's corner and the midfielder was able to place his header over the despairing Muslera. Substitute Stefan Kiessling should have made it 4-2 but blazed his shot over the bar, then Forlan almost took the match into extra-time when his ferocious free-kick boomed to safety off Butt's bar. The result meant that the octopus which had correctly predicted all of Germany's previous results at the tournament was right once again.","Sami Khedira heads late winner as Germany finish third at World Cup in South Africa .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- When Erika Clowes was pregnant, she figured breast-feeding would be a breeze. After all, she'd read all the books and taken all the classes. After an easy birth, she brought home her baby, Charlie, and waited for paradise to begin. The bagged breast milk filling Erika Clowes' freezer is evidence of how nursing dominates a new mom's life. But instead, it was a nightmare. Charlie wouldn't latch onto her breast. She was in horrible pain. She had to wake up every two hours around the clock to pump milk and then feed it to Charlie from a bottle. He had colic and cried nearly all the time. She'd been so devoted to the idea of breast-feeding, but now felt like quitting. ""I felt betrayed and completely deceived, because nobody told me it would be this hard,"" she says. ""It was the darkest time of my life."" Clowes almost became a statistic. According to new numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 74 percent of mothers try breast-feeding, but after three months only 30 percent still exclusively nurse their babies. After six months, the number dwindled to 11 percent.   Take our interactive quiz to see how much you know about breastfeeding » . The study didn't track the reasons the women quit nursing, but experts including Los Angeles, California, lactation consultant Corky Harvey said many women have a hard time nursing and don't know where to turn for help. She says one common reason for quitting is that women mistakenly think they don't have enough milk and decide to give the baby formula. Other women quit nursing when they go back to work, and others stop because family members encourage them to give bottles instead of breast milk. What kept Clowes from giving up was the ""Booby Brigade."" In the middle of the sleep deprivation, hormone rages, and feelings of failure, Clowes figured she had to do something. So she started the Booby Brigade, a group of new mothers near her home in Silver Lake, California, who met online and in person to give each other breast-feeding advice and support. With help from them, and occasionally from a lactation consultant, she was able to nurse Charlie consistently in about four months. From Clowes, her lactation consultant, and another mother who started a support group, here are five breast-feeding mistakes new moms make, and how to fix them: . Mistake 1: Moms go it alone . Solution: Get out of the house -- fast . Clowes was reluctant to join -- let alone start -- a support group. ""I hate that kind of thing,"" she says. But she did so out of desperation, and found the technical advice (how to latch on, how to deal with nipple pain) and emotional support indispensable. Anthropologist Katherine Dettwyler, who studies breast-feeding, isn't surprised that women often fail at breast-feeding when they're left alone at home to raise a new baby. ""Humans are very social creatures, and most of the world lives in extended families,"" says Dettwyler, an adjunct professor at the University of Delaware. ""You have mothers and grandmothers around who knew everything about breast-feeding. You're not isolated at home for eight or 10 hours a day."" In addition to the Booby Brigade, Clowes joined a support group at The Pump Station, a local store that sells nursing pumps. La Leche League also has support groups. If you don't find a group, start your own, Clowes suggests. ""I walked around my neighborhood and would just hand out a card with my name and phone number on it to other moms,"" Clowes says. Mistake 2: Moms forget about their successful breast-feeding friends . Solution: Invite one over . While lactation consultants can be wonderful, they can also be expensive -- a visit from one in the Los Angeles area costs $200-$300 an hour, according to lactation consultant Harvey. Amanda Corbin, a mom who started a support group called ""Got Milk?"" in Tampa, Florida, says sometimes help can be free. She suggests inviting over a friend who's breast-fed successfully, and show her your attempts at nursing. It might be embarrassing to reveal all to your friend, Corbin says, but ""we lay down our dignity during labor, so go ahead and lay down your dignity when it comes to the health of your baby."" Mistake 3: Moms assume they don't have enough milk . Solution: Rethink your baby's nursing behavior . Many times, new moms think if baby won't stop nursing, he must not be getting enough milk, so they give him formula. ""Sometimes babies just nurse and nurse and nurse -- that's just what babies do,"" says Harvey. ""It doesn't mean you don't have enough milk. It just means you should keep nursing."" Mistake 4: Moms get intimidated breast-feeding in public . Solution: Have snappy comebacks at the ready . Clowes says occasionally mothers in her group reported getting nasty comments when they've breast-fed in public. She suggests having a few retorts at the ready. On her Web site, crankylittleman.com, she has these two suggestions: ""If you're uncomfortable seeing my baby eat, you are welcome to cover yourself with this baby blanket. I'll let you know when we're done,"" and ""You think this is something? You oughtta see where he came out!"" Mistake 5: Moms panic when milk doesn't gush out . Solution: Realize that at the very beginning, you're not going to see a lot of milk . Through her work at the Booby Brigade, Clowes found some moms were expecting torrents of milk from the very beginning, and when they didn't get it, they'd give baby a bottle. They didn't understand that right after birth, moms produce small amounts of colostrum, a concentrated, nutrient rich liquid that's measured in teaspoons, not ounces, and is the perfect food for newborns.

"(CNN)  -- Spain won the World Cup for the first time in its history as an extra-time goal from midfielder Andres Iniesta gave his country a last-gasp 1-0 victory over the Netherlands in the final at Soccer City. The showpiece game of the South Africa-hosted tournament on Sunday was littered with no less than 14 yellow cards and one red but was settled by a moment of magic by the Barcelona man after he was played in by substitute Cesc Fabregas. His 116th-minute strike was the goal all Spaniards were waiting for and spared both sides the agony of deciding the new world champions by penalties. The breakthrough came after the Dutch had been reduced to 10 men, following Johnny Heitinga's dismissal in the second half of extra time by referee Howard Webb for a foul on Iniesta. ""It's incredible,"" Iniesta told gathered media in a post-match news conference. ""What a joy especially when you see how we won it. There aren't the words to describe what I am feeling. After my goal, I thought about my family and all the people who I love. But the victory is the fruit of a lot of work,"" an emotional Iniesta told reporters. Spain coach Vincente del Bosque added to the happy sentiment following his side's victory: ""Today is a reward for beautiful football. Everyone in the dressing room is ecstatic,"" he said. Del Bosque, who won two European Cups when in charge of club side Real Madrid, dedicated the win to his countrymen. ""Spain, the country, deserves this triumph. This goes beyond sport. We have to celebrate and are delighted to be able to offer this victory to all the people of Spain."" Del Bosque said it had been a pleasure to coach the side, which with the win adds the World Cup to its European crown. ""There is joy of being 50 days with this group of players who have given us the world title. It was a difficult match. Afterwards, I think that we were slightly better,"" he added. The coach also refused to be drawn into criticizing the tough tackling of the Netherlands: ""I'm here to speak about the beautiful things of football. Holland played a good game in an even, balanced match. Yes it was rough at times, but that is part of football."" For the Spanish came joy, but for the Dutch, desolation. The Netherlands lost its third appearance in a World Cup final, after previous defeats in the 1974 and 1978. Two second-half chances went begging for star player Arjen Robben. The flying winger was sent clear by Wesley Sneijder, only to be denied by a superb save from Spain captain Iker Casillas, who stuck out a leg to send the ball wide. Late in normal time Robben was also through and appeared to be pulled back by Spain defender Carles Puyol before Casillas saved again at his feet. Spain had great chances in the second half with David Villa denied by the legs of Heitinga, and Sergio Ramos who headed over with the goal at his mercy. At the end of normal time, the game remained scoreless, as the dropping temperatures and deadlock in the match served to quiet the sell-out crowd in the Soccer City Stadium. In extra-time, Spain pressed forward with yet more urgency and Fabregas was put through by Iniesta only for goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg to deny him with a smart save. With the game opening up, Joris Mathijsen was nearly an unlikely scorer for the Dutch while Spain substitute Jesus Navas saw his shot deflected into the side netting. But in the second half of extra-time, the goal chances dried up until Iniesta cropped up to score the winner. Substitute Fernando Torres, who later pulled up in agony clutching his hamstring, played in the initial ball. It was poorly cleared, falling to Fabregas, who sent a neat pass through to his teammate Iniesta, who had cleverly stayed onside. The Dutch angrily protested Webb should have awarded an earlier foul, but he waved the protests away and was soon signaling the end of an eventful final, marred by persistent fouling that broke up the natural rhythm of the game. A chest-high tackle in the first half by Nigel de Jong, which left Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso nursing bruised ribs, might have earned a red card, while Mark van Bommel also escaped harsher punishment after another thumping challenge. Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk -- who lost out on the chance to have become the first coach since 1970 to have led a side through World Cup qualifying and the finals unbeaten -- conceded Spain had deserved to win. ""The best team won. I am disappointed. Early on we gave chances away, we were not good enough in possession of the ball. But then we turned it around. We made a real game out of it and we had two great chances through Arjen [Robben]. ""It is very bitter, but that is sport. It is harsh. Spain were the better team,"" he told reporters after the game. In Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, most of the hundreds of thousands of people who'd gathered in the Museumplein square to watch the game on a giant screen filtered out in stunned silence after the final whistle, leaving behind trampled orange hats and a smattering of tearful people sitting on crates with their heads in their hands. ""I thought we could hang on till the penalties, and then it would have been 50-50,"" said a man in his 30s, wearing face paint in the colors of the Dutch flag. A woman in her early 20s had an expression that veered between a smile and a frown. ""We really thought we could do it,"" she said. ""It was tough to watch, and it feels tough now."" Back in South Africa, Van Marwijk defended the tactics that had seen his side regularly penalized by the referee: ""It is not our style, but then again you play a match to win. It is a World Cup final, and there is a lot of emotion -- you saw that at the end of the match. ""I would have loved to win the match, even with not so beautiful football. I'm not someone to look back on the what the referee did. I think the best team usually wins the match,"" he added.","Spain win World Cup for the first time with 1-0 win over the Netherlands .

"(CNN) -- Giovanni van Bronckhorst hopes that his dream will come true when he leads the Netherlands out against Spain in Sunday's World Cup final -- the last match of his distinguished career. The 35-year-old announced before the South African tournament that it would be his swansong, and earned his 100th international cap in the opening Group E victory against Denmark last month. On Tuesday, his spectacular long-range strike helped his team reach the final for the third occasion with a 3-2 victory against Uruguay on Tuesday. The defender now has the chance to help the Dutch lift the trophy for the first time, something that the star-studded team of the 1970s failed to do after losing in finals in Germany and Argentina. ""My last match turns out to be the match that I dreamed of,"" he told reporters, as quoted by the UK Press Association. Dutch legend Cruyff backs Spain to win . ""It is wonderful that I have the opportunity to win the World Cup as my final stop, far better than dying in the group stage. ""Everything has converged at just the right moment. It is fabulous that this World Cup will be the pinnacle of my work."" Van Bronckhorst, who began his career as a midfielder, made his name with Feyenoord before leaving his native country for spells with British clubs Glasgow Rangers and Arsenal -- the latter of which was blighted by injuries. He moved to Spain in 2003 as Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard took him to Barcelona first on loan and then in a permanent deal, transforming him into a left-back. Van Bronckhorst won the Champions League in 2006 before returning to Feyenoord a year later, when current Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk made him captain of his boyhood club. Van Marwijk has kept faith with the player since taking over from Marco van Basten as national coach following Euro 2008, which was won by Sunday's opponents Spain. Van Bronckhorst will come up against several of his former Barcelona colleagues in the Johannesburg title decider, including midfielders Xavi and Andres Iniesta plus inspirational defender Carles Puyol. ""I still have contact with them. I used to share a room with Carles before Barcelona games and we saw a lot of each other away from the football club,"" he said. ""We have actually already been on the phone offering each other best wishes, and it will be nice to say goodbye on Sunday face-to-face. ""But my boyhood dream is something more important, so they will have to make do with a silver medal this time.""","World Cup final is final match of career for Netherlands captain Giovanni van Bronckhorst .

"Hartford, Connecticut (CNN) -- If the World Cup were contested among continents instead of countries, the tournament would have had only two winners in its 80-year history: South America and Europe. And now that the Netherlands beat Uruguay, the only South American team left standing in the final four, Europe has emerged victorious. This year, all the signs in the host country said ""SOUTH AFRICA 2010."" But for most of June, some graffiti artist painted an ME over the F on each of those banners, for what we were witnessing at the beginning was, in essence, SOUTH AMERICA 2010. South America dominated from the opening kickoff concert, headlined by Shakira, the pop star from Colombia. Even before that, staring vacantly from the covers of countless previews, was the World's Best Player, Lionel Messi of Argentina. And even before that, five-time champion Brazil was expected to do what the Brazilians always do. Like Lance Armstrong, they wear yellow shirts and crush Europeans. For three weeks, Argentina's manager-mascot, Diego Maradona -- rosary wrapped around his fist, like brass knuckles -- strode the touchline like a sub-compact colossus. Refulgent in his shiny suit and diamond earrings, his black-and-white beard ablaze, Maradona carried off soccer balls and very nearly the entire show before his team came up against Germany in the quarterfinals. Steve McManaman, the former Liverpool and Real Madrid midfielder turned ESPN analyst, spoke for many viewers when he said before that match: ""I want to see the little lunatic, Maradona, running up and down the touchline, so I've got him to beat the German team on his own."" As recently as those quarterfinals, there was the real possibility that all four teams in the semis would be from South America, winners of nine World Cups. Europe, winners of the other nine, might be shut out of this rubber match. Past champions France, Italy and England had crashed out early to varying degrees of domestic condemnation: Calamité (the French), cataclisma (the Italians), catastrophe (the English). But a funny thing happened on the way to the semis: Netherlands came from behind in the second half to beat Brazil. Then the rest of Europe did the same, coming from behind in the second half of the World Cup to assert its dominance over South America, most emphatically when Argentina lost 4-0 to the free-scoring Germans, who suddenly seem to be the new Brazil, soccer's latest thing, its -- how's this for etymological irony? -- bossa nova. And Spain beat Paraguay. As a result, the only South American team in the final four was two-time champion Uruguay. And even then, the most effective Uruguayan at the tournament was a referee. England's Frank Lampard scored an obvious goal against Germany, but play was waved on by Uruguayan ref Jorge Larrionda. In missing the goal, Larrionda almost certainly ushered in a long-overdue era of instant replay or other goal-line technology to assist officials. As for the Uruguay team, it needed a miracle to beat Ghana in one of the most improbable finishes to a sporting event we will see in this century. Asamoah Gyan's penalty kick on the final play of the game rocketed off the crossbar to spare South America one spot in the semifinals among three elite European teams: Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. But Tuesday, time was up for Uruguay. It lost to the Dutch 3-2, helping the Netherlands make its first World Cup title match since 1978. No matter. South America has already secured a World Cup trophy in 2010. The other day at the airport in Bogota, Colombia officials seized a gold-painted replica of the famous Jules Rimet trophy. It was made entirely of cocaine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Rushin.","Steve Rushin: Cup winners for 80 years have come from South America or Europe .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Organizers of the 2010 World Cup hoped the soccer tournament could provide a catalyst for a ""re-branding"" of South Africa, and arguably there is no group within the Rainbow Nation that needs this makeover more than the Afrikaner community. The Afrikaners -- who count Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron and former athlete Zola Budd among their number -- are descendants of European, mainly Dutch settlers, who moved to the southern tip of Africa in the 17th century. Making up just under six percent of the population -- numbering around three million from an overall population of nearly 50 million according to the 2007 Community Survey -- it is the white Afrikaner people that were most closely associated with the ruling elite of the racist and oppressive apartheid regime that existed from 1948 to 1994. ""There was a long time that Afrikaners were perceived to be the polecats of the world, it is something we have to live with,"" Tim Du Plessis, editor of Afrikaans newspaper Beeld told CNN. ""But people [who come to the World Cup] will realize the Afrikaners are very indigenous to Africa. There's a brand new generation coming through who have traveled all over the world. They are not seen as racist Afrikaners they are seen a people of South Africa,"" he added. The Afrikaans language, which is the third most spoken in South Africa, like much of the group's culture is entwined with the country's recent divisive past; the plan to enforce the teaching of Afrikaans in black schools sparked the violence of the Soweto uprising of 1976 in which 23 students died after police opened fire. It was the tradition of Christian conservatism and social conformity as well as the shackles of a problematic past, which drove musicians Francois van Coke and Wynand Myburgh to show a new face of their community through music. As part of punk outfit F****polisiekar -- which is an expletive-laden Afrikaans' phrase for ""go away police car"" -- the Cape Town-based band has expressed their situation by singing in Afrikaans since 2003. ""I think with [our] music we were saying we're not part of that whole Afrikaner mentality, our first album was an outlet for that and the songs were quite angry. Things need to change,"" lead singer and guitarist Van Coke told CNN. The name, though offensive, was significant for the band members. ""If you grow up as an Afrikaner you have those images of cop cars driving around telling you what to do and how to behave, so the name was a way ... of leaving those mental bondages, of growing up in that community, behind,"" bass player Myburgh said. ""The Afrikaner has always been told exactly what to do ... we rebelled against that and tried to forge a new direction,"" Van Coke added. The controversial band's socio-political songs and questioning of the Christian faith have seen them become pariahs in their own community, but as one of South Africa's most popular groups -- who have toured with the White Stripes and Metallica -- they are helping to redefine the Afrikaner. ""There's a lot of talk about our language dying out, there is fear and anxiety that our identity will be lost. My point of view: we've never been pro-Afrikaner or pro the Afrikaans language -- we just are who we are, like or not. The most important thing is for people to give it space to breath, to grow, to allow change. ""Change is good, [the Afrikaner community] should take on a new face. Trying to hold onto what went before, to keep it the same is never going to work. There are a lot of people who are proud of being Afrikaans, and I get a lot of emails saying that because of our music they're proud of being Afrikaner again or that they think Afrikaans is cool,"" Myburgh added. While sound-checking for a gig in the bohemian, Melville suburb of Johannesburg, the musicians told CNN the World Cup had helped to alleviate some of the racial tensions that had risen as a result of the murder of right-wing extremist Eugene Terre'blanche. Two black farm workers were formally charged in April. ""Before the World Cup it felt like the country had gone back 15 years, the way things were going. But I think the greater majority of South Africa want a unified country,"" Van Coke said. And for a community that is almost defined by an all-consuming passion for the ""Springbok"" national rugby union team, the irony that a new national image and that unity could be forged via a soccer event, traditionally a black sport, was not lost on skeptical Afrikaners. ""Prior to the World Cup our readers were indifferent to the event. Our sport coverage was rugby, rugby, and rugby; even in the off-season. But now I hear stories all the time of Afrikaans people who were not interested in soccer, glued to their televisions watching the World Cup. Currently we have saturation coverage, and the readers like it."" Du Plessis added the hosting of a big event had resonated with many Afrikaners: ""They feel a bit alienated, because it's been a very black dominated World Cup ... and no white footballer played a game for Bafana Bafana, but they feel good that we're showing well on a global stage. ""Afrikaners are fiercely patriotic, they love their country and they want to show their best side to all of the foreign visitors."" Dennis Van Zyl, the 47-year-old chairman of the Old Grey's Rugby Club, is maybe an example of what Du Plessis has noticed from the feedback of his readership. The six-foot-five, predominantly Afrikaans speaking custodian was a former rugby union professional, playing flanker along side Springbok-greats such as Andre Joubert, Pieter Muller, Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha in the 1990s. From the clubhouse based in the Afrikaner capital of Bloemfontein, Free State, Van Zyl told CNN he had been bitten by the soccer bug: ""I had never watched football before the World Cup. Now I go home and watch soccer, all the white guys talk football now."" Van Zyl's rugby club -- which has seen 29 of its players go on to play for the national side -- has benefited from booming business over the last month thanks to its fortunate position a short walk from the Bloemfontein Stadium, a venue of six World Cup matches. Playing host to the throngs of foreign fans who flock to taste the specialty braai'ed (barbequed) meat on offer from the kitchen, has allowed Van Zyl to contribute to what he told CNN was his hope for the most important legacy of the World Cup. ""I would just like all the people who visited our country to go home and say, you know South Africa, it's not so bad. There is a bunch of good guys who are also there.""","Afrikaners make up just under six percent of South Africa's population .

"(CNN) -- For the second time in 24 hours, Canada broke U.S. hockey hearts. Using their speed and strength to control much of the play, the Canadians knocked their southern neighbors out of gold medal contention for the second straight Olympics with a 1-0 victory in a riveting men's semifinal match Friday. The victory came a day after the Canadian women won the gold medal by coming back in the final minutes to beat the Americans in overtime. Canada needed no late heroics Friday, outshooting the United States 36-31 and testing American goalie Jonathan Quick from all angles. The heartbreak reached all the way to the White House, where spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the game ""seemed just as stressful for (American) fans to watch"" as the women's final. ""But congratulations to Canada,"" Carney said. ""They certainly know their way around a hockey rink."" Canada's men now will face Sweden in the gold medal game on Sunday, while the United States faces Finland on Saturday for the bronze. The Canada-U.S. men's showdown pitted the defending gold medalists who claim hockey supremacy as a birthright against the plucky Americans who seek to stake a legitimate claim as the world's finest. A spirited game featured lots of chances but only one goal early in the second period, when Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn tipped in a pass disguised as a shot by St. Louis Blues defenseman Jay Bouwmeester. Benn gave credit to a player he competes against during the National Hockey League season, saying in a between-periods TV interview that ""Bouwmeester made a great shot-pass."" The game was a rematch of the gold medal final four years when Pittsburgh Penguin superstar Sidney Crosby scored the overtime goal for Canada to beat the Americans. This time, Quick of the Los Angeles Kings, a Stanley Cup winner and playoff MVP in 2012, kept the Americans in the game with a series of saves, including two on NHL teammate Jeff Carter and a sliding stop on Benn, who was unable to lift a shot from the right circle. At the other end, Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price stopped every U.S. shot, most of them from the outside or far off with little traffic in front. One of his toughest saves came early when Toronto Maple Leafs sniper Phil Kessel broke in on the right side for the Americans. Price blocked the angle to deny Kessel. ""Obviously, that team playing in front of me gave everything tonight,"" Price said after the match. He cited Canada's ""relentlessness"" for the victory, saying ""we were all over the place."" After a fast-paced even start, Canada took control near the midway point of the first period, firing eight shots to two by the United States over the next 12 minutes. The Canadians maintained the advantage the rest of the way, using a smothering team defense to stifle the Americans after Benn's second-period goal. With the top professionals competing, the Olympic tournament amounts to an effective hockey World Cup every four years, and the 2014 version has provided all the requisite story lines and drama for classic status. It came 34 years after the ""Miracle on Ice"" in Lake Placid, New York, when the then-amateur American team upset the dominant Soviet Union in the semifinals and went on to win the gold medal against Finland. There was a minor miracle this time, when St. Louis Blues forward T.J. Oshie almost singlehandedly beat host Russia in the preliminary round when he scored on four of six shootout chances to secure a 3-2 American victory after the teams tied through regulation play and overtime. On Friday, Oshie and St. Louis teammates David Backes and Kevin Shattenkirk took on fellow Blues Alex Pietrangelo and Bouwmeester, a defense pairing for Canada. Many such confrontations existed between the rosters comprised of NHL competitors. U.S. head coach Dan Bylsma also coaches Pittsburgh, and was trying to neutralize Crosby and Penguins' teammate Chris Kunitz. At one point in the first period, San Jose Sharks forward Patrick Marleau of Canada took a penalty for interfering with NHL teammate Joe Pavelski. For the Americans, the revenge factor was doubled after Canada beat the U.S. women 3-2 for the gold medal Thursday by scoring twice in the final minutes to tie the game, then winning it on an overtime power play. Kessel's sister, Amanda, was a top U.S. player throughout the tournament. Neither the Canadians nor the U.S. men had lost a game so far this Olympics, but both had close calls. Oshie's shootout heroics against Russia gave the Americans an easier route through the quarterfinals, where they defeated the Czech Republic 5-2 on Wednesday. Canada won an overtime nail-biter over Finland in its last preliminary match, followed by a tight 2-1 victory over upstart Latvia on Wednesday to set up Friday's clash with the Americans. Sweden is the only team to have won all its matches in regulation time. Two of its NHL stars, Loui Eriksson of the Boston Bruins and Erik Karlsson of the Ottawa Senators, scored in the second period Friday against Finland, while goalie Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers made 25 saves to secure the victory. Olli Jokinen of the Winnipeg Jets scored for Finland.","Canadian men advance to gold medal game with 1-0 win .

"Kamberg, South Africa (CNN) -- Sunlight sparkles through the drops of water that tumble off the edge of the cliff. Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in Africa. Behind them are two barely visible human figures. ""This is a sacred place,"" says Raphael Mnkhati, a guide from the Kamberg Rock Art Center. ""Water is important for all life, and it was important for the people who lived here."" The tiny cave behind the waterfall is only one of thousands of such hidden, secret shelters in the Drakensberg-Ukahlamba Mountains of South Africa. They were the home of the Bushmen, the original inhabitants of this country, who fled to these mountains to escape other Africans moving down from the north of the continent and white settlers moving up from the Cape.

Scattered throughout these mountains are some 60,000 individual images, visible at about 600 different sites. The artists used the blood and fat of the eland as well as whitened clay, bird droppings and charcoal as pigments. The delicate lines of the figures were etched with twigs, porcupine quills and ostrich feathers. Scientists believe that these figures were created by the Bushmen while they were in trance states, and that the paintings reflect the people's deep reverence for the beauty and power of the natural world that surrounded them. Higher up the mountain, hidden in a giant overhang at its very crest, is a remarkable fresco of hunters, antelope and mythic figures, known as therianthropes, which are part-human, part-animal beings. The paintings stretch in a long gallery across the rock face that extends for at least 30 meters under the stone roof. It frames a spectacular view of the tall peaks and the distant valley far below. ""You are not allowed to touch anything, or to collect anything here, it's a like a church,"" Raphael tells us. ""And this is why it is important for the Bushman people. Still today many people take their shoes off when they visit here -- as a sign of their respect."" One of the most well-preserved and mysterious panels in the Kamberg series shows a mythical human-like figure tugging the tail of an eland. Some scientists believe that this a sign of human recreation, almost sport, created by the artist -- or artists -- in a transcendent state of consciousness. Raphael has been coming here for years, and is now studying rock art through university, but the beauty of this ancient gift left behind by lost generations has not faded for him. ""The Bushmen are very special,"" he muses while looking out over the wide landscape that stretches out below, ""because they were living here, peacefully, in the mountains. We are all from the same origins. I feel very proud about this place and of the rock art that is here.""","Guide believes that some of the paintings could be 8,000 years old .

"(CNN) -- Luise Rainer, who won back-to-back Oscars in the 1930s for ""The Great Ziegfeld"" and ""The Good Earth"" only to quit Hollywood at the height of her fame, has died. She was 104. Rainer's death was first reported by her daughter, Francesca Knittel Bowyer, on Twitter. ""Mummy had the fragility of an orchid, the energy of a hummingbird, the tenacity of a hunter. She could change calm waters into a raging storm with a look and the lift of a finger,"" Bowyer told CNN in an email. ""My heart is a hole without her, but that hole will definitely be filled with incredible memories, sweet, salty and funny. I want her memory to linger with those who knew her and be given to those who did not."" Rainer, who was born in Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1910, was a well-known European actress when she was brought to America by MGM in 1935 in the belief she could be the next Greta Garbo. She immediately came through on their investment with her star turn in 1936's ""The Great Ziegfeld,"" winning a best actress Oscar. She repeated the achievement with 1937's ""The Good Earth,"" based on Pearl S. Buck's novel, in which she played O-Lan, the wife of protagonist Wang Lung. With that prize, she became the first actress to win consecutive best actress Academy Awards -- a feat not equaled until Katharine Hepburn pulled off the trick for 1967's ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and 1968's ""The Lion in Winter."" To date, they are the only actresses to have done so. Both Spencer Tracy and Tom Hanks have done so in the best actor category, and Jason Robards won two straight supporting actor Oscars. But unlike Hepburn, who enjoyed a long career in movies despite the vagaries of fame, Rainer's life as a Hollywood star was short-lived -- by her own choice. She had frequent battles with MGM boss Louis B. Mayer and didn't like the roles she was offered. ""All kinds of nonsense,"" she told the UK's Telegraph news site in 2009. ""I didn't want to do it, and I walked out. Mayer said, 'That girl is a Frankenstein, she's going to ruin our whole firm.' He said, 'We made you and we are going to destroy you.' "" Instead, Rainer turned the tables and left MGM. Her marriage, to playwright Clifford Odets, had fallen apart (partly over his envy of her friendship with Albert Einstein, who ""liked my vivaciousness,"" she said) and she returned to Europe. She married Robert Knittel, a publisher, in 1945. The two were married for more than 40 years, until his death in 1989. She made a film for Paramount, ""Hostages,"" in 1943, but that was it until 1997, when she appeared in a British production of Doestoyevsky's ""The Gambler."" She had other opportunities -- Federico Fellini asked her to appear in 1960's ""La Dolce Vita,"" but she had a falling-out with the Italian director before filming -- though she didn't lament leaving movies. Her life was quite full, with famous friends -- Arturo Toscanini and Thomas Mann among them -- and plenty of activity, including a few plays and TV roles. She wasn't easily impressed, by Hollywood or fame. Asked about the Nobel Prize-winning Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who stayed with her and Knittel in London once, she told the Telegraph that he was ""terrible."" ''You could not talk to him about anything except his own work, you know? He was so conceited, and demanding!"" she said. Despite her long life, she told the Telegraph that she felt that there was so much more she wished to know. ""I know nothing. Nothing!"" she said. ""My God, one's lifespan is so very short."" At the time, she was just shy of 100. Rainer is survived by her daughter, two granddaughters and two great-grandchildren.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- The training pitch is a dusty patch of ground used by the local police force as a car park, and the club house is located in a former women's prison that held Winnie Mandela captive during the apartheid era. Two of the team's players have been victims of ""corrective"" rapes -- Soccer City, this is not. The facilities of the Johannesburg-based ""Chosen Few"" lesbian football club could not be further from those of the glamorous teams that play in the 2010 World Cup, but the first such tournament to be held in Africa has proved inspirational to the members of this local squad. Ntombi ""Khampi"" Futhi used to play defense for her side, but after South Africa's ""Bafana Bafana"" national team kicked off the opening game of soccer's biggest event at the city's new 90,000-seater arena a few miles away, she has turned her focus to netting goals. ""I watched many, many World Cup games. I'm really enjoying it [and now] I want to be like Siphiwe Tshabalala [the scorer of South Africa's sensational opening goal of the event],"" she told CNN. ""The way he ran through the ball and struck the shot... I want to be like him, I want those skills -- I love that goal so much! ""I asked that my team try me in the striking force in the last game we played, and I scored! I was so happy. My teammate crossed the ball, I trapped it and took a shot and that was my goal. I was shocked. I shouted: ""I scored!"" It encouraged me to be a striker because now I want more goals."" Chosen Few, South Africa's only openly gay female football team, was created in 2004 by the Forum for the Empowerment of Women (FEW) to fill a void for many of the passionate, soccer-loving women who attended their sessions but who had been expelled from their township teams because of their sexuality. Can soccer heal a scarred society? From their base in what was the notorious Old Fort Prison -- a jail that incarcerated Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Luthuli, as well as Nelson and Winnie Mandela before it was converted for other uses -- the group is hoping to use sport as a tool to address the issues of homophobia by playing other women's sides in the area. Chosen Few's coach Dikeledi Sibanda, 27, told CNN that soccer had helped to give her strength. ""I love football, it is the only thing that kept me going when I was being hurt by what was happening at home and in my community. Soccer is my life,"" she said. Organizers hope that the all-lesbian team offers a safe haven for the players who previously suffered discrimination for being openly gay -- the worst manifestation of this being the ""corrective rape"" of two of the squad members. Phindi Malaza, program coordinator of FEW, said that South African society had not always proved an easy place to live for those involved with the team. ""One of our players, Tumi Mkhuma, was attacked in her township. She was out with her friends and these boys followed her. They beat her up until she was unconscious and then they raped her,"" Malaza said. From death row to defense: Soccer behind bars . ""This happened in 2009 but the police have still been unable to find the guy. We're hoping they will keep pursuing the case as she stills lives in fear it will happen again."" Sibanda added: ""They want to correct us, to show us what a man can do. They think that being a lesbian is immoral and uncultured. The corrective rapes are getting higher every day."" Pinkei Zulu, the 23-year-old captain of the side, said she had been affected by what had happened to her teammate. ""I don't walk at night now and I don't party unless it is a gay night. I walk hand-in-hand with my girlfriend, but we get called names. I just try to ignore them,"" she said. History of the vuvuzela: Battle of the horn . Though the past of the players -- who warm up by singing protests songs as they walk to training every Tuesday and Thursday -- may be troubled, the coming of the World Cup to South Africa means they have their thoughts firmly focused on the future. ""We played in a tournament recently where we lost in the final 3-2. But after watching the World Cup I wish my team would play like Germany, Argentina and Brazil because they play as a collective, not as individuals,"" Zulu said. Sibanda added: ""We are going to Germany to play in the Gay Games World Cup in July. In 2006 and 2008 we won bronze medals but in 2010 we will win gold.

"London, England (CNN) -- On June 21, 1930, a Frenchman boarded the SS Conte Verde at Villefranche-sur-Mer, carrying in his baggage a small winged statuette representing Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Also aboard the South America-bound liner were footballers from France, Belgium and Romania. The Frenchman was Jules Rimet and the golden trophy was the World Cup. Rimet's vision, conceived in the aftermath of World War One, was of a global tournament which reflected football's growing international popularity. But as the vessel set sail for Montevideo, the competition's prospects did not look particularly good. Uruguay had been awarded the event following gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Olympics, and because the competition coincided with the South American country's centenary celebrations. But, with the world's economy reeling from the Great Depression, just 12 other teams took part. England, claiming de facto supremacy in a sport they had invented and exported, were among those to snub the tournament. Unsurprisingly, the first final would prove a local affair, with the hosts beating neighboring Argentina 4-2. Two more World Cups would be played before World War Two -- both won by Italy -- but the competition remained an event finding its feet as sporting issues were overshadowed by the darkening mood in Europe. Rimet's trophy spent the war hidden in a shoe box under the bed of an Italian football official. A new era began in 1950 as hosts Brazil built the world's biggest football stadium, Rio de Janeiro's Maracana, to showcase a competition which they were also expected to dominate. England, finally sending a team, suffered an ignominious 1-0 defeat against the U.S. but it was the final match that delivered the greatest shock as Uruguay, in front of an expectant crowd of almost 200,000, stunned the hosts 2-1. In Brazil the match became known as the ""fateful final."" Yet it was also the trauma of the defeat which would fuel Brazil's obsession with winning the tournament, paving the way for the country's later dominance. 2010 World Cup: A catalyst for a new South Africa? The World Cup returned to Europe in 1954 with Switzerland playing hosts and Hungary, led by ""Galloping Major"" Ferenc Puskas, arriving as favorites. The Hungarians thrashed in 17 goals in their opening two games, including an 8-3 win over West Germany, their eventual opponents in the final. But in a match known in Germany as the ""Miracle of Berne,"" it was Fritz Walter's side who emerged as 3-2 winners. The 1958 World Cup in Sweden marked the arrival of a 17-year-old superstar called Edison Arantes do Nascimento, better known as Pele, as Brazil were crowned champions at last. Pele didn't appear until the quarterfinals, but followed the winning goal against Wales with a hat-trick against France and two more in a 5-2 win over the hosts in the final. Brazil were winners again in 1962 in Chile, this time inspired by Garrincha's trickery. The winger scored four times in wins over England and Chile before Brazil completed the defense of their crown with a 3-1 win over Czechoslovakia. 1966 was the year when England finally embraced the World Cup, with home advantage proving enough to carry Alf Ramsey's side all the way to the title, capped by Geoff Hurst's hat-trick in a 4-2 final win over West Germany. But the victory also marked the beginning of the country's still unfulfilled obsession with repeating the feat. The 1970 World Cup in Mexico was a technicolored spectacle, brought live to millions of television screens by satellite technology and featuring a virtuoso performance by a Brazilian team considered the greatest in football history. Pele produced the tournament's most memorable cameos, including his famous near-miss from the halfway line against Czechoslovakia and an astonishing dummy that sent the ball past a bewildered Uruguayan keeper -- though neither moment led to a goal. The save from his downward header by England goalkeeper Gordon Banks is rated by many as the best of all time. Jairzinho achieved the unique feat of scoring in every match while captain Carlos Alberto capped his side's 4-1 win over Italy in the final with an emphatic finish that summed up the Brazilians' supremacy. By 1974, the World Cup was starting to resemble its modern incarnation, with teams such as Zaire -- the first from sub-Saharan Africa -- and Australia extending the competition's reach beyond its roots in Europe and South America. Johan Cruyff's brilliant Dutch side took the tournament by storm with their revolutionary ""total football"" but it was hosts West Germany who came out on top 2-1 in the final. Who will be the World Cup's best player? Home advantage also proved decisive in 1978 as Argentina ended their long wait for World Cup success with Mario Kempes scoring twice in a 3-1 win over the Netherlands in the final. For some however, the tournament was tainted, offering apparent legitimacy to the country's oppressive military regime. Italy ended their long wait for a third title in 1982 in Spain, recovering from a slow start to beat favorites Brazil in a thrilling second-round match in which striker Paolo Rossi scored a hat-trick on his way to winning the top scorer's Golden Boot. West Germany were the Italians' opponents in the final, though their passage was marred by a semifinal penalties victory over France principally remembered for a horrendous challenge by West German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher which left Frenchman Patrick Battiston unconscious. Rossi opened the scoring in Italy's 3-1 win. The 1986 tournament in Mexico belonged to Diego Maradona, whose individual brilliance carried Argentina to victory virtually single-handedly -- literally in the case of his notorious ""Hand of God"" goal against England. Maradona's second goal of that match, a waltzing solo from inside his own half, confirmed him as football's greatest talent since Pele, and not even a West German fightback from two goals down in the final could prevent Argentina being crowned champions as 3-2 winners. The 1990 tournament in Italy opened with a stunning upset as Cameroon beat Argentina 1-0 in a brutal performance which saw them end the game with nine men. Argentina regrouped to advance to the final, setting up a rematch of the 1986 final against West Germany. This time the West Germans, the tournament's most impressive side, came out on top, winning 1-0. Maradona's last World Cup, in the U.S. in 1994, ended in disgrace as he failed a drugs test. Colombia went into the competition as favorites but their participation ended tragically with early elimination and the murder on their return home of defender Andres Escobar, the scorer of a critical own-goal. That left Brazil, led by Romario, carrying the South American challenge, while Italian Roberto Baggio hauled his team through the knockout stages in a trio of match-winning performances against Nigeria, Spain and Bulgaria. But Baggio's fate was to be remembered as the man who missed in the first final to be settled on penalties, shooting over the crossbar to send the World Cup back to Brazil for the first time since 1970. World Cup predictions . Brazil reached the final once again in 1998, but the buildup to their clash with hosts France would prove more dramatic than the match itself as the world's most feared striker, Ronaldo, was first omitted from the Brazilians' team sheet and then reinstated at the last minute. Later reports suggested Ronaldo had suffered a pre-match fit, and the incident seemed to be playing on his teammates' minds as Zinedine Zidane struck twice for France in a 3-0 win, triggering wild celebrations on the Champs Elysees. In 2002 the World Cup visited Asia for the first time, co-hosted by Japan and South Korea. It was a tournament of upsets with Senegal humbling France in the opening game and South Korea riding their luck and some generous refereeing to oust Spain and Italy on their way to the last four. Turkey were also surprise semifinalists, but the final brought together two heavyweights in Brazil and Germany. Making up for the disappointment of 1998, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2-0 win as Brazil became five-time winners. Both Zidane and Marco Materazzi found the net in the 2006 final in Germany between France and Italy, but it was the pair's off-the-ball clash deep into extra time that became the tournament's defining moment. Zidane had emerged from international retirement to lead his country to the final, a fitting stage for the greatest player of his generation's final game. Instead, Zidane was dismissed from the field for headbutting Materazzi, apparently in retaliation to some verbal insult offered by the Italian defender. France's 10 men held out for a 1-1 draw but without their talisman the fates had swung decisively against them. Having defied the distraction of a match-fixing scandal at home and beaten hosts Germany in a tense semifinal, the Italians held their nerve once again to convert five perfect penalties and win the World Cup for the fourth time.","Only 12 teams traveled to Uruguay for the first World Cup ever held in 1930 .

"(CNN) -- South Africa's police minister has claimed there is currently no terrorist threat to the upcoming World Cup. Nathi Mthethwa sought to refute recent media reports alleging that South Africa is vulnerable to some form of terrorist attack during the June 11 to July 11 tournament. He said South African police have been working closely with intelligence agencies in each of the 31 countries sending teams to South Africa. ""It would be folly for any country to grandstand and proclaim that it is immune to terror attacks,"" Mthethwa told reporters in Johannesburg on Monday. But ""there is no threat to South Africa as we speak now."" Mthethwa played down last week's warning by the U.S. government to its citizens that South Africa faces a heightened risk of terrorism during the World Cup. Mthethwa his forces would be ready to deal with any threat that might emerge. ""Each country has the right to say whatever they want to say to their citizens,"" he said. ""All we are saying in South Africa is that together with the security forces of U.S., UK and others, we have prepared ourselves for any eventuality."" Meanwhile, on the pitch, there was a major boost for the host nation as South Africa recorded their biggest victory since returning to international football in 1992 with a 5-0 thrashing of Guatemala. Katlego Mphela scored twice from the penalty spot, while Reneilwe Letsholonyane, Surprise Moriri and Bernard Parker were also on the scoresheet as Bafana Bafana warmed up for the showpiece in style.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN)  -- Pretoria is a city desperately trying to shake off its image as the former headquarters of apartheid. While Cape Town is South Africa's tourist hub and Johannesburg the economic center, Pretoria is the country's administrative capital. South Africa's equivalent of the White House, known as the Union Buildings, is situated here. So is Loftus, one of the country's 10 World Cup stadiums. On the outskirts of Pretoria are large plots and farms where many apartheid-era generals and ministers have retired. Also surrounding the capital are various ""black townships,"" including Mamelodi, where CNN correspondent Nkepile Mabuse was born and raised. ""Etched in my mind is an incident in Pretoria in the early '80s when, as a little girl, a big white man spat on me on the very first day 'whites only' cinemas opened their doors to black people,"" Mabuse recalled. ""Today, Pretoria is a city that, while littered with many reminders of South Africa's painful past, is also rich with evidence of its transformation,"" she said. CNN.com asked Mabuse for tips on her favorite Pretoria spots. Where can you get the best view of the city? The view from the steps of the Union Buildings is pretty spectacular. The official seat of the South African government is located in these buildings. Which restaurant would you take a loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? For a totally African experience, I would recommend Moyo. This large restaurant and special event venue is situated in one of the oldest nature reserves in Pretoria. Here you can order not only South African food but also experience tastes from other parts of the continent. Before digging into your food, though, you will be invited to wash your hands in traditional African style or get your face painted. Depending on which day you choose to go, you may also be treated to the sweet melodies of the Moyo Beauties or a live band. Where is the best place for people-watching? You can experience the energy of a new, culturally diverse and vibrant post-apartheid Pretoria at Brooklyn Square. Its trendy courtyard restaurants are where the beautiful people of this town converge to eat, drink and listen to live music. What is your favorite neighborhood? Brooklyn, a suburb east of the city center. Its streets are lined with breathtakingly beautiful trees. Its houses are old Dutch style on the outside but modern on the inside. Many of its residents shop and play at Brooklyn Square. How do tourists stick out, and what's the best way to blend in? Opening your map in the middle of the street or asking just about everyone you bump into for directions is a total no-no, not only in Pretoria but everywhere else in South Africa. If you are lost inside a mall, ask the security personnel or help desk for assistance. If you are on the road, stop at a gas station and ask the attendants for directions. Most South Africans are very friendly and willing to help, but since it's impossible to tell a criminal from an ordinary citizen, it's better to play it safe. If you need to refer to your map, make sure no one is watching. What's the biggest misconception about your city? That it is backward. Pretoria is just as cosmopolitan as Johannesburg and Cape Town. Where do you go to relax? Mangwanani. It is the quintessential African spa and has several branches in town. What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? The 60-year-old Voortrekker monument is one of the first imposing structures you will see when driving into Pretoria. It is an architectural marvel that chronicles the history of the Afrikaner between 1835 and 1854, when Voortrekkers, or pioneers, left the Cape Colony for the interior of what is now South Africa. Not very far from it is Freedom Park, opened in December 2007, a memorial and symbol of South Africa's hard-won democracy. The most spectacularly beautiful court in South Africa is the Palace of Justice, where Nelson Mandela and others were sentenced to life in prison in 1964. It is in the city center's busy Church Square. Is there a ""tourist trap"" that's actually worth seeing? The Union Buildings. Not only can you get the best view of the city from here, you can get pretty close to the presidential headquarters. Buy a souvenir or ice cream from the handful of traders there and take a walk down its vast manicured lawn. It is in the auditorium of this building where Nelson Mandela's historic inauguration took place in 1994 and where every South African president takes his oath. What was your most memorable meal? Nigerian couscous at Moyo. It's fantastic. Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? Menlyn Square has some of the city's most popular bars, all in one location. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? If you would like a taste of South Africa, you have got to try pap, a porridge made from maize, usually served with loads of sauce, a vegetable or meat. Try it with chicken feet. To drink, try Amarula. It's made from the African marula fruit and is usually served on crushed ice. What is a good local souvenir? Without a doubt, a vuvuzela. It is an elephant-sounding plastic trumpet blown by fans at every football game in South Africa. Get one that is nicely decorated with beads or hand-painted in the South African flag colors.","For broad look at city, take in view from steps of Union Buildings .

"Ningbo, China (CNN) -- China's football team did not make it to the World Cup this year, but that does not mean the country's presence has not been felt: The Asian giant has cornered the market on perhaps the most unforgettable off-field aspect of the World Cup -- the vuvuzela. Ninety percent of the vuvuzelas, the plastic South African trumpet whose loud rasp has become synonymous with the 2010 World Cup, are made in China, according to the China Daily. The Chinese did it the same way they have done for so many other products: low costs and quick production at factories like the one run by Wu Yuye just outside the southern Chinese city of Ningbo. With a few dozen staff, they make more than 20,000 bugles a day. So far this year, they have churned out more than 1 million of them. ""I'm very proud that our vuvuzelas made it to World Cup in South Africa, especially since we have such a small family factory,"" Wu said. And she is not alone. A recent poll in the state media found that more than 60 percent of respondents were proud the ""made in China"" vuvuzelas were so popular in South Africa. Making the trumpets is simple: plastic is melted into a mold and then it sets. A small group of women take off the sharp edges to finish off the process. Wu said it costs about US$0.40 to make each vuvuzela. But outside the stadiums in Johannesburg, the vuvuzelas can sell for up to $8. Despite the markup, not much is coming back to the Chinese manufacturers. Wu said she makes just a few cents on each one. ""Although we don't make a lot of money, I'm sure we'll have a good future making these,"" she said. That's because Wu and all the vuvuzela makers in China are looking beyond the World Cup. Domestic orders are starting to come in, including for the Asian Games in Guangzhou later this year. Wu is hoping that the vuvuzela will be the next must have accessory for all sports fans -- maybe the next giant foam finger -- at events like baseball, basketball or rugby. While a lot of debate has centered on the loud and droning noise of the vuvuzela, Wu has the tact of a business person who knows where the sales are. ""The vuvuzela is a tradition in South Africa, it makes a happy sound,"" she said.","State media: 90 percent of vuvuzelas are made in China .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Most football fans, if they are not already, will have to become rabid carnivores during their visit to South Africa for the World Cup. South Africans like their meat and they like to cook and eat it out in the open, under the clear blue skies. If you are invited to a ""braai"" or a ""chisa nyama"" you are basically going to a barbeque. There are variations on what you will be offered, depending on who is hosting you and where you are. In general, you will find yourself eating spicy sausages called ""boerewors,"" lamb chops and some ""pap,"" which looks like mashed potato but is maize meal. Pap is often served with delicious tomato gravy. Of course, the food is washed down with copious amounts of South African beer. Another meat staple in South Africa is ""biltong"" -- which is a bit like beef jerky, but tastes much better. Biltong is an excellent snack to nibble on as you journey through the country. Try the kudu or ostrich biltong, or just stick to good old beef. Either way, you can get addicted to the stuff. It is very more-ish. The key to eating well in South Africa, or anywhere in the world, is simple: stick to local, fresh dishes. So I would not suggest that English football fans order grilled sole in Rustenburg, which is nowhere near the sea. However, the French and Danish football fans have it lucky -- their teams are based in Knynsa, on the Garden Route. So local oysters and fresh fish, such as the succulent Kabeljou, should be on their menus. That said, except for Cape Town and the surrounding areas in the winelands which have sophisticated restaurant scene, most South African food is simple and not fancy. So, stick to the basics at restaurants and a huge T-bone or a juicy fillet steak will not disappoint you. The prices might knock your socks off -- choice pieces of meat are much cheaper than in most capital cities. If you are looking for a quick meal on the way to a football match, munch on decent burgers from ""Steers"" or delicious spicy chicken from ""Nandos."" You should be able to find at least one of these eateries in most South African towns. If you prefer a good-sized trendy sandwich packed with rocket leaves and other posh nosh, try the ""Lulu"" chain. You can also get excellent takeaway coffee from the distinctive, red-and-white decorated ""Vida e Caffe."" As far as fast-food joints go, all of these offer great food. South African farms export fresh fruit and vegetables to Europe, so do not worry about getting sick from dirty germs that plague some travelers in developing countries. Often, the food in South Africa is fresher than the stuff you buy in supermarkets in London or elsewhere on the continent. During the winter here in the Southern Hemisphere, you will find loads of avocados on the shelves. Stock up, because I think nothing tastes as delicious as in-season avos from the Limpopo region of the country. Also, ""mielies"" are what the rest of the world call ""corn on the cob."" South African mielies are sweet and crunchy, so look out for them at a braai or when you go food shopping. Don't be a nervous eater when traveling to South Africa, it would be a shame to miss out on the cheap, fresh produce available.","South Africans love to cook lots of meat at outdoor barbecues known as ""braais""
Popular foods include spicy sausages called ""boerewors,"" lamb chops and ""pap""

"Sialkot, Pakistan (CNN) -- Through choking traffic and crude streets, pastoral scenes and fields of wheat, there is a journey to be made in the heart of the Punjab that will take you to the very soul of the beautiful game. For a country some have come to see as the world's leading exporter of terror, it is a glimpse into all that is possible when you consider that for decades now Pakistan has also been a leading exporter of hand-stitched soccer balls. This is no cottage industry, in a typical year Pakistan produces almost half of the world's hand-stitched gems. In a World Cup year like this one, as demand explodes, that portion edges up to almost 70 percent. The craft here has been handed down for generations and now hundreds of stitching halls dot the agricultural landscape of this region. ""A good player will play with this ball, it makes me feel good, it brightens our country's reputation and that makes me feel proud,"" says one young man as he continues stitching about six to eight balls a day. That will earn most of these workers anywhere from six to 10 dollars a day, as much as double Pakistan's minimum wage. Khawaja Masood Akhtar is the owner of the aptly named Forward Sports. For almost two decades he has won big-brand contracts against the odds and is currently a prime supplier for Adidas. ""The ball stitched in Pakistan will definitely be of a higher quality,"" said Akhtar. He adds that he has great admiration for the stitchers that craft his perfectly rounded balls. ""It's hard work -- you need very strong upper body strength to do that, and this is not easy. They are doing the job by hand but it looks like some machine,"" adds Akhtar. For years now, Forward Sports has been binding the tradition of craftsmanship with the demands of research and development. Their goal here is to not just meet, but surpass FIFA standards. Balls are poked repeatedly and pressed for hours to test water resistance. Then they are heat-tested to simulate how they will be after two years. And then there is the shooter machine, where a ball is kicked repeatedly by a shooting machine more than 3,500 times. The stitching string is stressed, there is even a machine that simulates headers, all of it part of the struggle in keeping Chinese manufacturers from dominating the game. ""Without competing with China no one can stay nowadays in the industry. Things are very simple you have to exactly do what your customer needs,"" said Akhtar. Akhtar chuckles when this reporter points out the official World Cup ball will come from China this year. He admits, it does bother him a bit. In fact, China with its massive production scale and low currency is the threat here, not the Taliban. And yet the stigma of terror is one more thing to overcome. ""It hurts in a big way, because it stops a lot of people from abroad ... because especially from the U.S. people don't want to travel here. Many big brands have a travel ban,"" says Akhtar. But Pakistan is still in the game. Forward Sports says it has worked hard to keep up with tougher quality standards and lower prices, and it says it has eradicated child labor from the production pipeline. ""We are not those kind of people, we are honest, we do good work here, the world knows our product. We make products not war,"" said one long-time employee. This industry defies Pakistani stereotypes but there is no pretending the game sparks passion here. That is reserved for cricket; it's the business of the game that takes all the glory here.","Pakistan is leading exporter of hand-stitched soccer balls .
