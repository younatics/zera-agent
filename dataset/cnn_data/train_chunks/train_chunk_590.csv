The . ex-leader, who was ousted by the Socialists a year ago, said President . Hollande had displayed a ‘total lack of leadership and his government . was ‘collapsing'. Sarkozy’s scathing assessment of the left-wing administration was reported in French daily Le Parisien. Comeback: Nicolas Sarkozy, with his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, says he may have no choice but to stand for re-election . He said: 'The socialist government is . falling apart. I am extremely worried. I am also deeply concerned for . the 1,500 extra people who lose their jobs every day. 'Francois . Hollande is completely useless and has no authority. Our society is . very fragile and one more straw could collapse it. I could be obliged to . make a comeback.' His . comments come only two months after he hinted at standing for . re-election in 2017 because the socialists were ‘ruining France’. Dissatisfaction . with President Hollande’s government saw tens of thousands take to . Paris streets earlier this week on the first anniversary of his election.

FRESH BLOW FOR FRENCH ECONOMY . French . industrial output fell by a worse-than-expected 0.9 percent in March . due to lower production in the farm and transport sectors and a sharp . drop in refining activity, data showed on Tuesday.

Super-hero sniffer mice that could save lives with a twitch of their nose are being bred by scientists. The ‘danger mice’ have been genetically modified so that their noses are hundreds of times more sensitive to the scent of explosives than house mice. In future, they could be deployed to countries scarred by war to rapidly sniff out landmines, which are then cleared by a human handler. One of the mice in study during training, when they hone their skills with DNT, a chemical cousin of TNT that is safe to work with the lab. Although the project - funded by the US government’s health research arm - may sound rather off-the-wall, the idea of super-sniffer rodents is not without precedent. A Belgian charity already uses giant . African rats to sniff out TNT and has deployed them in Mozambique and . Tanzania and on the Thai-Burmese border. However, while the HeroRATs, as they are called, are very good at their job, it takes nine months of painstaking work to train them to detect TNT. The Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference in New Orleans heard that the answer could be to use genetic modification to bypass the need for this extensive training. The mice are trained to have noses 500 times more sensitive to TNT . Researchers believe mice could be bred to sniff for landmines, which a chip under their skin alerting handlers when they find traces of TNT . Using GM technology, scientists at the City University of New York have created mice that have up to 500 times more of nose cells that detect TNT-like chemicals. Researcher Charlotte D’Hulst  said: ‘The rats are very effective but mice have some advantages as mine detectors because they are cheaper to manage and house and easier to breed.’ In addition, it is relatively easy to manipulate the key cells in the mouse nose. It is hoped that the animals’ inbuilt sensitivity to TNT-like chemicals means they will not have to be trained. Instead, they will naturally home in on explosives. Possibilities include planting a chip under their skin that will sense changes in their behaviour that indicate that they have spotted a mine. The professionals will then step in. A Belgian charity already uses giant . African rats to sniff out TNT and has deployed them in Mozambique and . Tanzania and on the Thai-Burmese border. They have been trained to make a clicking noise when they smell the explosive. A bite of banana serves as a reward and an incentive. Rats were chosen because they have an acute sense of smell, yet are small and light enough not to detonate the mines. The . project has been highly successful, with team of two rats and two . handlers who clear the mines after they are detected, covering more than . 3,000 square feet of land in an hour. In comparison, it would take two men using conventional detection equipment two full days to cover the same area.

Dr D’Hulst, who describes the mice as biosensors, or biological sensors, said: ‘This is only for detection purposes. 'You’d still need the human handlers to take the mine out. ‘There are about 72 nations contaminated or affected by mines. ‘The big problem with mines is that they are an enduring legacy of conflict, so after the wars have ended communities are still impeded from going back to their normal daily lives. ‘Mine removal is a very expensive, very lengthy and hard business and there is a critical need for a TNT biosensor.’ The Red Cross said that the danger mice would only ever be one means of detecting hidden explosives. It added that in an area packed with mines, the animals noses may become quickly overwhelmed.","Genetically modified mice have noses 500 times more sensitive to explosives .

New recipe: Sprite is to be reformulated with a 'natural' sweetener so it contains 30 per cent fewer calories . The fizzy drink Sprite is to be scrapped as we know it in favour of a lower-calorie version that uses a 'natural' sweetener. The new formulation of the popular beverage will contain 30 per cent fewer calories - but fans fear it will have an unusual aftertaste. The drink is being altered as part of the parent company Coca-Cola's anti-obesity drive and follows a call by the government to address the issue. The company is airing its first anti-obesity TV ad in the UK tonight. In a statement today, Coca-Cola confirmed the launch of 'a new, reduced-calorie Sprite in the UK from March 2013'. 'We are introducing . Sprite with Stevia in the UK. This will contain 30 per cent fewer . calories and, instead of being added as a mid-calorie addition to the . Sprite range, it will completely replace the current Sprite,' it read. 'Stevia, a sweetener from natural . origins, is sweeter than sugar but without the calories. 'It is an . extract from the leaf of the stevia plant which is native to Paraguay. Stevia has been used for centuries as a source of intense, natural . sweetness.' The herbal sweetener, Stevia, is already available in the French version of Sprite. A plant used for centuries by Paraguay's Guarani Indians, it has shot from relative obscurity to being used as a key sweetener by large . companies such as Coca-Cola and Danone in just a few years. First introduced in 1961, Sprite is now sold in 190 countries. The lemon and lime drink contains 65 calories and 15.9g of sugar in each 150ml can. The name came from the ‘Sprite Boy’ character that had been used to advertise Coca-Cola in the 1940s and 1950s. It was launched to compete against 7UP that had first been formulated in 1929 by Charles Leiper Grigg. The Sprite slogan 'Obey Your Thirst' was launched in 1994. Sprite is the UK's seventh-biggest-selling carbonated soft drink. In 2009, its UK sales were £63.1m - almost double that of 7UP. Encouraged by a growing distrust of artificial sweeteners and an increased demand for natural products, they have turned to the plant extract that is up to 300 times sweeter than traditional beet or cane sugar. However, critics say it has a very strong aftertaste - it is often compared to liquorice - and it is far more expensive  than other widely-used artificial sweeteners including aspartame, saccharin and sucralose. Coca-Cola's anti-obesity TV ads have been airing in the U.S since January (see video below) and a Coca-Cola spokeswoman said the ad will roll out to other countries throughout the year. The two-minute clip, titled 'Coming Together', 'reminds' viewers that all calories count in . managing weight, including those in Coca-Cola's products. It . will be followed by a second ad later in the evening which will tell . viewers how much physical activity they would have to do to burn those . calories up. The ad touts Coca-Cola's record of selling drinks with fewer calories over the years and notes that weight gain is the result of consuming too many calories of any kind and not just fizzy drinks. Scroll down for video . The new version of Sprite will be made from the 'natural' sweetener Stevia (left). In its new TV ad campaigns parent company Coca-Cola argues that diet as a whole - and not just fizzy drinks - are to blame for obesity . Coca-Cola says its latest marketing campaign will kick off a variety of moves that help address obesity in the upcoming year, such as providing more diet options. Diet drinks already make up nearly half of Coca-Cola's UK sales, with Diet Coke and Coke Zero accounting for 45 per cent of sales. The company also says that since 2007, it has reduced the calorie content of Fanta Orange by 30 per cent, Oasis by 35 per cent and Lilt by 56 per cent. It also plans to 'reduce the average calories per litre of our range of sparkling soft drinks by five per cent by the end of 2014'. The company is still exploring whether to bring the Sprite with stevia to the U.S. James Quincey, President of The Coca-Cola Company's Europe group, said: 'Obesity is a serious problem and I am . determined we will take more actions in Europe to help address it. The . actions announced today build on our earlier efforts and are part of a . long-term commitment.'","Regular version to be reformulated and made with 'natural' sweetener Stevia .

The media magnate Alexander Lebedev yesterday protested his innocence over a charge of hooliganism motivated by ‘political hatred’ as a Russian judge lifted a travel ban allowing him to fly to Britain. The businessman, whose family own the Independent and the London Evening Standard, faces up to five years in jail in a case that raises acute concerns over state interference in newspaper freedoms.

News: 'For the first time in a long time, he is talking about her [Vanessa]. They both want to make it work.' Rumours: Depp and his Rum Diaries co-star Amber Heard who was seen accompanying him to Las Vegas on his private jet as he promoted his latest film Dark Shadows . Paradis also denied the speculation and hit out against the claims in TV chat show Le Grand Journal as she promoted her new movie Cafe de Flore. She said: ''People say we are buying houses in the middle of nowhere, or that we have fifty two houses in France. 'And that is along with saying we split up every winter and get married every summer, and that I'm on my twelfth pregnancy. 'All that is not too serious, but this latest one is a rumour which could cause a lot of harm to my family and my children.' However, a few months later a number of publications carried . pictures and reports that Johnny and Heard enjoyed a trip together to . Las Vegas on a private plane when he was in town promoting Tim Burton movie Dark Shadows. Hitching more than a ride? Heard was snapped boarding Depp's private jet with the actor in Las Vegas in April . Again, Vanessa was nowhere to be seen and didn't accompany him on any of . his promotional duties for the film. Hiding her troubles: A glum-looking Vanessa hidden under a big hat jetted out of Los Angeles last week . Last month they continued to deny that their . relationship was on the rocks, but Vanessa was snapped walking round Los Angeles looking rather glum and hiding under a big hat. Last . week she scowled at photographers as she flew out of Los Angeles under . another huge hat as she jetted to France for the Cabourg Film Festival. And ever the professional, three days later she flashed her sexy gap-toothed smile as she joined her co-stars for the photocall for her new movie Je Me Suis Fait Tout Petit (I Was Made Very Small). And throughout the day she did not . shy away from meeting people and was happy to sign items for fans, even . though the announcement of her split from Depp was imminent. Depp, . 48, and Vanessa, 39, got together in 1998 when they met in the Costes . Hotel in Paris while he was filming the Roman Polanski film The Ninth . Gate. He had had a high-profile engagement . to Winona Ryder and a long-term relationship with Kate Moss and she had . just come out of a relationship with French-Slovenian actor Stanislas Merhar, having been reportedly previously engaged to singer Lenny Kravitz. A year after they got together, Depp . and Paradis's first child, daughter Lily-Rose Melody, was born, followed . by their son John 'Jack' Christopher in 2002. In . 2007, the family were in London when Lily-Rose fell ill with a serious . E.coli infection that caused her kidneys to start shutting down and she . was rushed to Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. So grateful was Depp for the care and . attention the staff gave his daughter that in November 2007 he visited . in his Pirates of the Caribbean character Jack Sparrow to visit the . patients and the following year he donated £1million to the hospital. Ever the professional: Just a couple of days ago, Vanessa put on a brave face as she attended a photocall for her new film in Cabourg, France and happily signed autographs for fans . He and Paradis never married but he . recently stated that having children cemented roots for him and added . that they gave him 'real foundation, a real strong place to stand in . life, in work, in everything'. New love: Depp and Paradis at the Sleepy Hollow premiere in 1999, just a year after they met . He added: . 'You can't plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful . ride I was on. It was destiny; kismet. All the math finally worked.' And Paradis explained why the pair never felt the need to marry and said: 'I love the romance of ""let's get . married"", but then, when you have it so perfect ... I mean, I'm more . married than anybody can be – we have two kids. Maybe one day, but it's . something I can really do without.' In 2010, she also gushed: 'I could make an endless list of . all the things I admire about him. 'We understand that, if we . want our relationship to continue, we must give each other space, allow . each other to go off on our own, and trust each other. Not everyone is . lucky enough to be given space and trust.' Depp is worth an estimated $300million and the family have divided their time . between their homes in Meudon, in the suburbs of Paris, two in Los .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:57 EST, 26 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:44 EST, 26 February 2013 . The influential former archbishop of San Francisco said Monday that Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony has a rightful place in selecting the next pope, despite pressure for him to not attend the papal conclave over rising allegations he covered up priest sex abuse. The support from Cardinal William Levada, who was in charge of handling the sex abuse scandal for the Vatican until recently, comes as Pope Benedict XVI revealed he will take the title of 'emeritus pope' after he abdicates at the end of the month. Levada, who led the Archdioceses of San Francisco for a decade until he became a prefect in Rome, slammed sex abuse victims who are calling for Mahony to stay home when it comes time to select the next pope. 'There are some victims groups for whom enough is never enough, so we . have to do our jobs as best we see it,' said Levada, 76, who spoke with . reporters from a Menlo Park seminary as he prepared for his trip to the . Vatican for the papal conclave. Defense: Cartindal William Levada (left), who handled the sex abuse scandal for the Vatican, said Cardinal Roger Mahony has made up for his 'mistakes' as Archbishop of Los Angeles - which allegedly include covering up allegations of child sex abuse by priests . 'No American pope': Levada, who is a top Vatican insider, said no American will be chosen as pope because the perception of U.S. government influence would be too great . Mahony left for Rome over the weekend after recently released church documents showed he had covered up for other priests who raped and molested children in the Archdioceses of Los Angeles while he was Archbishop. Levada said: 'He has apologized for errors in judgment that were made. I believe he should be at the conclave.' On Monday, Mahony took to social media and his own personal blog to write about 'persecution and forgiving one's enemies.' He said he has a special prayer group for people who 'cannot forgive me for my past hurts and offenses,' including members of the media, attorneys, protesters and those who 'hate and despise me.' He also tweeted from Rome, writing: 'Anyone interested in loving your enemies, or doing good to those who persecute you? See my blog for today. Wow, Jesus is demanding.' Levada said Cardinal Keith O'Brien's decision Monday to step down as archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh and to opt out of the conclave will 'provide the freedom to do a good independent investigation and decide on appropriate measures to take on this case.' As Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, O'Brien was Britain's highest-ranking Catholic leader. He said he did not want . allegations that he engaged in improper conduct with priests to be a . distraction during the solemn process of choosing the next leader of the . church's 1.2 billion-member flock. Stepping down: Pope Benedict XVI will continue to wear white vestments and will be known as 'pope emeritus' after he steps down . It was the first time a cardinal has recused himself from a conclave . because of personal scandal, according to Vatican historians. The Vatican insisted that Pope Benedict XVI accepted Cardinal O'Brien's resignation purely because O'Brien was nearing the retirement . age of 75 - not because of the accusations. Levada, who leaves for Rome on Tuesday, retired in 2012 after spending six years as the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican's orthodoxy watchdog, which also defrocked pedophile priests. He played a key role in several church sex-abuse reforms. While serving previously as an archbishop in California and Oregon, he kept some accused molesters in the church and failed to share some allegations with police or parishioners. Levada and Mahony will join more than 100 cardinals on Thursday in Rome . to begin the historical process that will choose a successor to Pope . Benedict XVI, whose decision to retire took worldwide Catholics by . surprise. The pope wears Prada: Benedict will retire his iconic red Prada loafers when he retires . Levada, whose Vatican job was held by the former Cardinal Joseph . Ratzinger before he became Pope Benedict XVI, said in all his years of . service, he never anticipated being called to a conclave. Levada also said bureaucratic reforms at the Vatican will require a lot . of attention from the next pope. He said he'll be looking for a . candidate with deep faith, someone who has shown leadership and has . language skills. He said youth is also a factor, and he extinguished any . rumors that the next pope might be from the U.S. 'I don't know what the Las Vegas oddsmakers are saying today,' he said, 'but I don't think it's likely that we would see an American pope. 'It . would be an additional complexity for an American pope to have to deal . with the perception that some of his decisions might be perceived to be . dictated by American governmental policy.' Replaced: Benedict will wear a pair of custom-made brown loafers that were given to him during a 2012 trip to Mexico . It was revealed on Tuesday that Pope Benedict XVI will be known as 'emeritus pope' in his retirement and will continue to wear a white cassock, the Vatican announced Tuesday. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Benedict himself had made the decision in consultation with others. Benedict decided he would be called 'Your Holiness Benedict XVI' and either emeritus pope or emeritus Roman pontiff, Lombardi said. While he will no longer wear his trademark red shoes, Benedict has taken a liking to a pair of hand-crafted brown loafers made for him by artisans in Leon, Mexico, and presented to him during his 2012 visit. He will wear those in retirement, Lombardi said.","Cardinal William Levada said former Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahoney had already admitted his failings in covering up priest abuse .

After a weekend of sunshine and high temperatures, the UK's beaches were all but deserted again today as parts of the country were warned to batten down the hatches with winds of up to 65mph set to batter Britain. The Met Office has issued weather warnings for much of southern England and Wales tomorrow with the most blustery weather expected in coastal areas. Forecasters have warned that transport could be disrupted as a result along with possible damage to trees. Blustery: Kite surfers enjoy the windy weather and roughs seas at Tynemouth Beach today . Making the most of the weather: The surfers have more wet and windy weather to look forward to with the outlook not particular pleasant for the rest of the week . Flying: A kite surfer is blown above the sea in Tynemouth earlier today . Surf's up: The windy weather was in stark contrast to the bank holiday weekend when conditions were less than suitable for kite surfing . The turn for the worse weather wise . comes after the UK enjoyed its hottest day of the year so far on Monday . with temperatures hitting 24C in Crosby, Merseyside. But the mercury will have dropped at least 10C below that for the rest of the week, with sunshine replaced by showers and rain. Brighton . beach was all but deserted this morning - a stark contrast to the bank . holiday weekend when brilliant sunshine and soaring temperatures saw it . thronged with sunseekers. And . the conditions overnight saw a yachtsman taking part in the Solent 650 . Solo race between the Isle of Wight and Plymouth run aground on Bovisand . bay in Plymouth. The French yachtsman was unable to control the 21ft vessel called Diaoulici which was stranded on the beach this morning. The boat was not reported to be badly damaged and is lying on the sand.However, a coastguard spokesman said they are unsure if an operation to get the yacht out of the water will be successful. Deserted: Brighton beach, which was packed full of sunseekers over the bank holiday weekend, was empty today as the weather took a turn for the worse . Contrast: Tynemouth beach in the north east was also packed at the weekend, but the golden sands were deserted aside from a handful of dog walkers today . Room to manouvre: A vehicle has plenty of space to drive along Tynemouth beach today - and the beach looks likely to be deserted over the next few days with wind and rain forecast for much of the country . He said: 'There are strong winds in force and so I don’t know what is going to happen to the boat. 'The conditions will make it difficult for any salvage operation. 'If we send a boat out to help, it could get into trouble itself.' But the high winds weren't bad news for everyone. While the beach's golden sands were . deserted, kite surfers enjoyed rough seas and blustery conditions in . Tynemouth today as the weather began to take a turn for the worse. Tomorrow . will see the weather become wet, windy and unsettled according to Met . Office forecasters, with strong winds particularly in the south west and . southern Wales. Safety first: These lifeguards were the only people to be seen on a deserted Bournemouth beach today . Overcast: Dark clouds over Bournemouth beach today looked ominous as more rain and wind was forecast for the remainder of the week . Blaze: Fire spreading on the moors above Ripponden, West Yorkshire, on Wednesday. The dry ground and strong winds has enabled the fire, which has been burning since Saturday to spread . Flames: Firefighters attempt to tackle the blaze on the moors in West Yorkshire earlier today . Batten down the hatches: A severe weather warning is in place for part of the UK tomorrow . Gusts will reach around 65mph on the coast and around 50mph inland with temperatures look set to peak at around 15C. Yellow warnings have been put in place from around 9am tomorrow with an area of low pressure sweeping across from the west of Ireland to blame. A Met Office forecaster said: 'We're expecting strong winds for this time of year, but certainly nothing unprecedented. 'With trees starting to blossom that means they are susceptible to branches breaking off in the wind in some areas. 'But thankfully because we've had a late spring the damage will not be as bad as it could be.' Friday will still be windy but gusts will have significantly died down with showers and plenty of cloud forecast for much of the UK. According to the Met Office, Saturday will be a fairly similar day, fairly breezy again with a few light showers. Rain could be more persistent in some areas. Heavy weather has meant that a 60ft section of cliff has been cordoned off following the latest landslide to hit Britain’s south coast. A huge crack has appeared along a section of coastline after the latest in a series of rockfalls along 50ft cliffs at Barton on Sea in Hampshire. Dog walkers raised the alarm after the giant crack opened up above a row of prized beach huts following months of prolonged heavy weather. It comes just days after a huge rockfall at Dorset beauty spot Durdle Door sent hundreds of thousands of tonnes of chalk crashing down onto the beach below. The incident sparked warnings to walkers to stay clear of the crumbling coastline for fear of repeat rockfalls. John Yeoman, a dog walker from nearby New Milton, said: 'I’ve been watching that crack develop for a year now, and it has definitely got worse over the last few days. Stranded: Blustery weather caused this 21ft vessel to run aground in Plymouth overnight . Tough conditions: A French yachtsman believed to be taking part in the Solent 650 solo sailor race from Isle of Wight to Plymouth became grounded in Plymouth . 'I dare say that bit will collapse all the way one of these days but it is taking its time. 'There have been a lot of little falls here since January, although nothing too serious. 'But I understand nothing is going to be done to protect the cliffs, so nature will just take its course. 'They say it will be about 50 years before it is cut back enough to reach the houses.' Meriel Tandy, a resident of Barton on Sea for 56 years, added: 'It is sad to have lived here all these years and watch the cliff falling into the sea.' The slip follows a more substantial slide in February further west which has left part of a nearby car park cordoned off. Cordoned off: Heavy weather has meant that a stretch of land is in danger of slipping on the coast in Hampshire . No go zone: Walkers have been warned to stay away from the stretch of coast near Barton on Sea in Hampshire . Precarious: The crack looks as if it might take a section of this homeowner's garden with it should it slip into the sea . The inclement weather didn't put a dampener on a celebration to mark the end of winter and beginning of spring however. Dancers turned out in their hundreds for the Helston Flora Dance in Cornwall. The day, which is steeped in tradition, sees a variety of dances take place across the town from 7am into the night. But the highlight is the midday dance which was traditionally the dance of the gentry and still sees the men wear top hats and the women dresses to take part.

Astronomers have detected clouds of carbon monoxide and water vapour around a huge gassy planet orbiting a star 130 light years away. The study is the most detailed yet of the atmosphere of an 'exoplanet'. In future, scientists hope to use similar techniques to uncover signatures of life in the atmospheres of Earth-like worlds. Discovery: An artist's impression of the HR 8799 star system at an early stage in its evolution, showing the planet HR 8799c, as well as a disk of gas and dust, and interior planets . The planet, known as HR 8799c, has seven times the mass of Jupiter and is one of four similar planets distantly orbiting the star. Observations suggest the solar system was created in a similar way to our own, with gas giants forming far away from their parent star and smaller, rocky planets closer in. If this model is correct, there could be as-yet undetected Earth-like planets waiting to be found. 'The results suggest the HR 8799 system is like a scaled-up Solar System,' said Dr Quinn Kanopacky, one of the astronomers from the University of Toronto in Canada. Light wavelength 'colours' act like fingerprints for different elements. By studying the light from a distant planet, scientists can make assumptions about what elements are contained in its atmosphere. New model: The study could help scientists discover how our own solar system and Earth was formed . The presence of oxygen’s cousin ozone or carbon dioxide, for instance, could indicate that a world harbours life. Because HR 8799c is so big and far out - about the same distance from its star as Pluto is from the Sun - astronomers were able to image it directly rather than infer its presence. The observations were made using the Keck II 10-metre telescope in Hawaii, one of the two largest optical telescopes in the world. Dr Bruce Macintosh, from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, US, one of the co-authors of the research published in the journal Science, said: 'This is the sharpest spectrum ever obtained of an extrasolar planet. This shows the power of directly imaging a planetary system. 'It is the exquisite resolution afforded by these new observations that has allowed us to really begin to probe planet formation.'","The planet, known as HR 8799c, has seven times the mass of Jupiter .

Warning: US Vice President Joe Biden will warn David Cameron about leaving the EU when he visits Downing Street on Tuesday . The US is to warn David Cameron not to pull out of the EU, as new polling shows the Prime Minister received minimal benefit from his offer of an in/out referendum. Vice-President Joe Biden will fire a fresh shot across Mr Cameron’s bows when he visits Downing Street on Tuesday – following talks with French and German leaders. A senior adviser to Mr Biden said: ‘With respect to Prime Minister Cameron’s speech, we obviously support his comments about the important role of the UK in the EU.’ A second aide added: ‘It’s in our interest for there to be a strong UK in a strong EU.’ Mr Biden will hold talks with Nick Clegg in Downing Street before holding a ‘working lunch’ with Mr Cameron and attending a meeting of the National Security Council. The fresh pressure on Mr Cameron comes as a poll commissioned by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft found that his Europe speech has not shifted attitudes to the Conservative Party or changed the proportion of people who want to see a Tory government after the next election. Labour’s lead has shrunk to five points – with the Tories on 33 per cent to Labour’s 38 per cent – but the change largely resulted from Conservative voters at the last election becoming more likely to vote Tory again and some existing supporters saying they were more likely to turn out. Lord Ashcroft said: ‘The speech, and more importantly the policy it articulated, has made Tories feel better about being Tories. ‘This is not to be sneezed at – but . let’s not confuse it with having changed anybody’s mind. Back in . December less than three in five of 2010 Tory voters said they would . vote Conservative in an election tomorrow; after the speech that number . had risen to two in three.’ Lunch: After meeting French and German leaders, Mr Biden will hold talks with Nick Clegg in Downing Street before holding a 'working lunch' the PM . A second aide added: 'It's in our interest for there to be a strong UK in a strong EU' While Tories have warmed to the Prime Minister, he has a battle on his hands to persuade allies and party grandees. Former Tory Chancellor Geoffrey Howe yesterday accused him of making his speech to silence Tory critics rather than out of principle. Lord Howe, who helped bring down Margaret Thatcher because he regarded her as too Eurosceptic, told a Lords debate: ‘I would like to think I was wrong in suspecting that the Prime Minister’s sudden conversion to the merits of a referendum is less about occupying the moral high ground of democratic consent than the search for a means to overcome the problems of internal party management.’ Meanwhile, Europhile minister Ken . Clarke was slapped down yesterday for undermining the Government’s first . attempt to repatriate powers from Brussels. No change: A poll commissioned by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft found that his Europe speech has not shifted attitudes to the Conservative Party . Home Secretary Theresa May last year announced that she planned to opt out of 140 European Union rules related to crime and justice, including extradition and the European Arrest Warrant. Yesterday Mr Clarke claimed ministers were ready to hand 30 criminal justice powers back to the European Union, but was accused by senior government sources of ‘getting ahead of himself’. The Home Office insisted no decision had yet been made. A spokesman said: ‘We have made a commitment to a vote in both Houses of Parliament before we take a final decision. That vote will take place in good time before 2014.’ A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘There’s a lot of common ground between Ken Clarke and the Liberal Democrats on Europe but he’s getting ahead of himself'.","Joe Biden will meet David Cameron at Downing Street following talks with French and German leaders .

Set to get slimmer: The latest Apple gadget will feature 'in-cell technology' which has touch sensors in the screen instead of another layer on top as it is now . A factory in Taiwan has begun production of components for Apple's eagerly awaited iPhone 5, expected to go on sale this autumn. Pegatron - one of Apple's normal suppliers - has begun production of the new phone already, according to a report in DigiTimes. The manufacturer will also be working on a smaller iPad later in the year. Details of the upcoming handset are scant, although it is expected to have a larger screen than the current iPhone. The new iPhone will have an even thinner screen thanks to advances in LCD manufacturing, according to reports. The . latest Apple gadget will feature ‘in-cell technology’ which has touch . sensors in the screen instead of another layer on top as it is now. Further sources in Apple's supply chain confirmed that the tech giant will drop the wide dock connector used in the company's gadgets for the best part of a decade in favour of a smaller one, a change likely to annoy the Apple faithful but which could be a boon for accessory makers. The iPhone 5, Apple's next generation iPhone expected to go on sale around October, will come with a 19-pin connector port at the bottom instead of the proprietary 30-pin port ‘to make room for the earphone moving to the bottom’, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. That would mean the new phone would not connect with the myriad of accessories such as speakers and power chargers that form part of the ecosystem around iPods, iPads and iPhones, without an adaptor. That means new business, analysts say.‘It represents an opportunity for accessory vendors,’ said Pete Cunningham, London-based analyst at technology research firm Canalys. ‘The iPhone connector has been a standard for a long time now and I would expect the same to be true for a new connector, should Apple change it as expected.’ Apple did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. It's coming! 9to5Mac has released this image, purported to be the iPhone 5. Features that can be spotted include a much larger screen, and a smaller dock connector . Tech blogs have long speculated on the demise of the 30-pin connector, . which at 21 mm wide takes up a chunk of space, especially as the latest . technologies such as microUSB offer more power in less space. They say that a smaller connector would give Apple more scope for new . product designs or a bigger battery, or simply to make ever smaller . products. Switzerland's Logitech, one of the biggest makers of Apple speakers, declined to comment. But some enterprising vendors in China have already begun offering cases . for the new phone, complete with earphone socket on the bottom and a . ‘guarantee’ the dimensions are correct. For some in the peripherals industry, the change could open doors to new business. ‘iPod docking speaker sales have been declining for one or two years,’ said an employee of a Hong Kong-based company that designs speakers . especially for Apple products. ‘My previous factory is a lucky one. They shifted the focus to Bluetooth . speakers, which proved a wise decision now,’ the employee said, . speaking on condition of anonymity. ‘It looks like while iPod speaker sales are going down, Bluetooth speaker sales are going up.’ Apple.pro printed these images of what they claim is the fascia of the next iPhone, suggesting the screen is much larger .","Apple supplier has started manufacturing new handset .

Syrian forces have mixed chemical weapons and loaded them into bombs ready to use on President Bashar Assad's own people if needed, it was reported today. A senior U.S. official revealed that bombs were loaded with components of the deadly nerve gas sarin. Syrian forces have 60 days to use these bombs until the chemical mixture expires and has to be destroyed. Scroll down for video . Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is believed to be preparing chemical weapons for use against his own people . Sarin disrupts the chemical balance in nerve cells and makes them to lock out in the ‘on’ position. Death usually results from suffocation, caused by the stoppage of the diaphram, the main muscle that controls a person's lungs. The first symptoms are a runny nose and tightness in the chest, followed by coughing, chest pain, confusion and loss of consciousness. Sarin was first developed by the Nazis in the 1930s as a pesticide and is 500 times more deadly than cyanide.One milligram of pure sarin is enough to kill a 10 stone person if absorbed into the skin or inhaled. The most shocking Sarin attack was in 1995 when the Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo released it on the Tokyo subway, casing 13 deaths and injuring 5,000. In 1953 Royal Air Force engineer Ronald Maddison died during human testing of Sarin at the Porton Down chemical warfare lab in Wiltshire. He had been told the test was to try and find a cure for the common cold. Recovery from exposure to Sarin is possible with prompt injections of atropine, an alkaloid extracted from deadly nightshade. NBC News cited sources saying bombs filled with a sarin component have not yet been loaded onto planes, but the Syrian military is prepared to use these chemical weapons against civilians pending orders from Assad. The U.S. has said chemical weapons use would be unacceptable and would trigger greater Western intervention in the conflict. In Brussels yesterday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated concerns that 'an increasingly desperate Assad regime might turn to chemical weapons' or lose control of them to militant groups. She also said NATO's decision on Tuesday to send Patriot missiles to Turkey's southern border with Syria sends a message that Ankara is backed by its allies. The missiles are intended only for defensive purposes, she said. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was quoted in the Turkish newspaper Sabah as saying that Syria has about 700 missiles, some of them long-range. Gunmen loyal to opposite sides in Syria's civil war battled Wednesday in the streets of the Lebanese city of Tripoli. The fighting has killed six people and wounded nearly 60 since Monday, security officials said. The bloodshed is a sign of just how . vulnerable Lebanon is to getting sucked into the Syrian crisis. The . countries share a porous border and a complex web of political and . sectarian ties that is easily enflamed. The . Lebanese men killed in Syria were Sunni Muslims, like the majority of . rebels trying to overthrow Assad's regime. Assad and much of his inner . circle belong to the Alawite sect, which is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Warning: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated concerns that 'an increasingly desperate Assad regime might turn to chemical weapons' Deadly: Non-chemical cluster bombs allegedy used by Syrian security forces on the town of Deir Essafir, East Ghouta district in Damascus . The effects of shelling by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo's Bustan al-Basha district . The fighting in Lebanon comes at a time of deep uncertainty in Syria, with rebels battling government troops near Assad's seat of power in Damascus. Syria has been careful not to confirm it has chemical weapons, while insisting it would never use such weapons against its own people. But as the regime wobbles, there are fears the crisis will keep spiraling outside its borders. Fighting has spilled over into Turkey, Jordan and Israel since the uprising began more than 20 months ago, but Lebanon is particularly susceptible. Seventeen times bigger than Lebanon and four times more populous, Syria has long had powerful allies there, including the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. For much of the past 30 years, Lebanese have lived under Syrian military and political domination. Meanwhile, the unrest inside Syria shows no sign of slowing down. The uprising began with peaceful protests in March 2011 and later escalated into a civil war that the opposition says has killed more than 40,000 people. Besides the violence roiling the capital, Damascus, there was growing speculation about the fate of a top Syrian spokesman who has become a prominent face of the regime. Lebanese security officials have said Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi flew Monday from Beirut to London, NBC News reported. But it was not clear whether Makdissi had defected, quit his post or been forced out. Syria has had no official comment on Makdissi, who has defended the regime's crackdown on dissent.","Senior U.S. official says bombs were loaded with deadly nerve gas sarin .

"By . Hugo Gye and Paul Bentley . PUBLISHED: . 06:21 EST, 22 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:31 EST, 22 March 2013 . A grandmother was killed yesterday when her home was crushed by a landslip. Susan Norman’s ground floor flat was flattened as the three-storey building collapsed just before 6am after violent downpours hit Looe, Cornwall. Mrs Norman, 68, who lived alone, had complained to authorities that she feared her home might collapse following a nearby landslip in December. Collapse: A house in Looe, Cornwall has partially fallen after a night of heavy rain . Search: A rescue team and sniffer dog have attended the scene looking for a missing resident . Her children, Helen, Matthew and Rachael, had not heard from her since she went to bed at 7pm on Thursday after a long journey. They had clung to the faint hope she . was alive until authorities told them last night they had found Mrs . Norman’s body in the rubble. Her daughter Rachael Boden said that the . family was ‘extremely numb’. More than a dozen local residents were forced to evacuate the street over fears more properties were at risk of damage. But Ms Norman, who is in her 60s, could not be found, so a search team with a sniffer dog arrived at the site to investigate the possibility she might be trapped within the rubble of the house. Scenic: But the beautiful landscape in Cornwall was the scene of tragedy today . Neighbours said they heard 'windows . popping' at the three-storey property under the pressure of a torrent of . surface water which had been washed down the road behind the building, . split into three flats. Devon . and Cornwall Police duty inspector Graham Claybourn said: 'The property . and adjoining properties were evacuated this morning, everybody was . accounted for. 'However, one lady has not been accounted for. She lives in the ground flat. 'We're . waiting for a geothermal engineer from the council to come down and . assess the scene. There was some building work going on at the time.' A council spokesman said: 'This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the missing woman. 'The . council is working with the emergency services and the Health and . Safety Executive to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of . the landslip.' Unsafe: Emergency workers fear a further collapse at the property could endanger the search . Investigation: Emergency workers with the springer spaniel sniffer dog helping them with the search . A springer spaniel sniffer dog, used by emergency services to detect the scent of humans, was sent to the edge of the property this morning. Friend Edwina Hannaford described Ms Norman as 'a happy, lovely lady'. She said: 'Susan was well-known in the town and was an active volunteer. She was a very happy lady, very friendly and smiley, and would always say hello. 'The whole town has been on tenterhooks waiting for news, and sadly the news that a body has been found is what we had been fearing. 'I'd like to thank the emergency services, who have toiled very hard for many hours. 'This tragedy has hurt the community. But the fact that so many people have been offering to help in any way they can is testament to the spirit here. 'Our condolences obviously go out to all those affected.' Warning: Susan Norman had previously expressed fears that her home was in danger of collapsing . Evacuation: More than a dozen local residents have been forced to leave their homes . Mr Claybourn said Ms Norman had returned from a trip yesterday evening. He . said: 'The woman was away but returned last night at about 6pm. There . are no other suggestions where she might be - she might be in there. 'It has been confirmed by her family locally. She was last heard from yesterday evening.' Her neighbours today revealed that Ms Norman had previously warned officials that her home was at risk from flood damage. Sally Marsh, a hairdresser who lives on the same road, said: 'The lady that has gone missing has complained that she is not happy and has told them that this was going to happen. 'She has predicted this and it is just terrible because we don't know where she is or if she is safe. 'There was a landslip in December and all they did was put cones down, we keep telling them and kept saying this would happen but they wouldn't listen.' The property, named 'Veronica', is one of a number of detached homes along the road, overlooking a sheer drop to the picturesque Looe Valley railway line. Sandplace Road, which runs along the entrance to the properties, has been closed to traffic for months after a landslide nearby just before Christmas. The road running along the back of the homes, a main road into the coastal town of Looe, was said to have been carrying excess surface water which locals said was caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and uncleared drains. Workers: It is unclear whether the woman is trapped inside or if she earlier left the property . Retired police officer Pete Temlett, who phoned the emergency services after being woken by a panicked neighbour in Sandplace Road shortly before dawn, described how everyone was in a 'state of shock'. The 59-year-old said: 'I got a knock on the door at about 5am from the young man who lives in the top-floor flat. 'He was obviously in a state of shock and said his house had collapsed and he had to escape. 'I immediately got dressed and went down to the house with him, but I could see it could collapse at any moment. 'The windows were popping out and you could see the house was moving. 'My immediate thought was for the safety of the woman who lives in the bottom flat, but I couldn't go in there. I thought if I open a door it could collapse and cause her more injury.' He said he thought the problem - which has resulted in the stone wall at the front of the property falling away - had been caused by a combination of a build-up of surface water and clogged drains. Damage: This is not the first landslide on the street in eastern Cornwall where the woman is missing . Location: The house that collapsed is in Looe, near to Plymouth in the eastern part of Cornwall . The former Avon and Somerset officer, who is staying with friends nearby after being told he was not allowed to return to his home, said: 'I have been speaking to the council for a long time about this. 'This is something that could have been avoided. I have told the council the drains need clearing but I think we have been treated with absolute disdain.' Mr Temlett said he submitted a 65-page dossier of evidence to the council, warning them of the problem, but that his calls for help have fallen on deaf ears. He added: 'This was an accident waiting to happen.' Many of those evacuated were taken to the Guildhall in the town, although it is understood they have since found alternative accommodation. It is believed emergency services had to be called in to remove one elderly woman from her home, who was known as a recluse and did not want to leave the property.","Susan Norman, in her 60s, unaccounted for after her flat was destroyed by landslide after overnight downpours .

Edward the pug was born with three legs and a stump, but now walks on all fours after being fitted with a prosthetic limb. The one-year-old rescue dog is one of the first animals in Australia to be given an artificial leg and can finally run and play with his friends at the Pug Rescue and Adoption centre in Victoria. As a result, Ed has been chosen as the face of a new Victoria State Government welfare fund that will protect vulnerable pets such as himself. Scroll down for video . Walk this way: Edward the pug can finally walk on all fours again having been fitted with a prosthetic leg made by American specialists . When he first arrived at Pug Rescue and Adoption Victoria, his saviours were told that Ed had his leg bitten off by his mother as a small puppy, but it is more likely that he was born with the little stump. After a rather ‘unsteady’ road to the rescue centre, which included behind sold to as a breeding stud (despite missing a leg, a testicle and having a genetic skin condition) and then advertised as a ‘cheap way to own a pug’, Edward was finally able to get the care he needed . After a trip to Dogs in Motion canine rehabilitation centre in Doveton, Victoria, the rescue centre’s team began to work on getting Ed back on his feet – all of them this time. Walking aid: One of the volunteers at the Pug and Rescue Centre Victoria helps Edward put on his prosthetic leg for the launch of the Animal Welfare Fund in Melbourne . Top speed: Nothing can slow Edward down as the wobbles along in his harness, helped by an elastic band bringing his leg forward as he walks . His peg-leg and harness is designed by Martin Kaufmann, a specialist animal prosthetics expert who said he had many sleepless nights figuring out the prefect design for Ed. After a long process which included casts being taken of Edward’s legs and special visits by Mr Kaufmann, who normally works in America, Ed’s unique leg arrived in June. In the beginning, the prosthetic had to be fitted with an elastic band so Edward could learn to bring his leg forward as he walked – something which he had never learned to do as a puppy. Superstar: Victoria State Treasurer Kim Wells plays with Edward as they launch the $1.6 million Animal Welfare Fund in Melbourne . Bad start: Ed was handed in to a special rescue centre for pugs after his breeder had tried to sell him as a 'cheap alternative' when his his career as a stud dog failed . Fortunately it has been a success and with the harness keeping the leg in place, Edward can now run and play without the help of the elastic band, and the centre hopes he will be adopted by a loving home. The new $1.6 million fund Edward is promoting will assist not-for-profit animal care centres helping animals in similar situations. The initiative was launched by Edward and Victoria State Treasurer Kim Wells at Pug Rescue and Adoption Victoria and will be funded largely from penalties, fines and seizures from illegal puppy farms with the Government guaranteeing $400,000 a year for the next four years.","Edward can now walk on all fours for the first time in his life .

Nigel Ackland, 53, has been fitted with the Terminator-like carbon fibre mechanical hand which he can control with movements in his upper arm . A father who lost his arm in an accident six years ago has been given a new lease of life by a hi-tech bionic hand which is so precise he can type again. Nigel Ackland, 53, has been fitted with the Terminator-like carbon fibre mechanical hand which he can control with movements in his upper arm. The new bebionic3 myoelectric hand, which is also made from aluminium and alloy knuckles, moves like a real human limb by responding to Nigel’s muscle twitches. Incredibly, the robotic arm is so sensitive it means the father-of-one can touch type on a computer keyboard, peel vegetables, and even dress himself for the first time in six years. Mr Ackland operates the futuristic arm by sending the same signal from his brain he used to operate his original, human arm. When the muscles in the upper arm are flexed, this is detected by sensors that trigger one of 14 pre-programmed grips, mirroring human movements. The different grip patterns include a clenched fist, a pointed finger and a pinching motion, according to how the user tenses their upper arm. He is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of a four-month trial, which it is hoped will see the electronic arm made publicly available. Mr Ackland, who worked as a smelter, was forced to retire after losing his arm. He said his new hand has given him 'a whole new quality of life'. He said: 'I knew straight away that the end result of my accident would be horrible so I asked for my arm to be cut off, which was the right decision in the end as the arm was dead anyway.

The hand features a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual's requirements . Right-handed Mr Ackland, who lives with his wife Vanessa, 50, and son Conor, 19, in Royston, Cambridgeshire, lost his arm when it became caught in an industrial blending machine at a smelting plant in 2006. The metal worker instantly knew he had lost the lower-half of his limb even though doctors worked frantically to save it. After six months of operations and infections he decided to have a below-elbow amputation. But the severity of his injury meant his amputation wasn’t straightforward and left him with a flared stump and difficulty finding suitable prosthetics. His injuries meant he was forced to take early retirement, but struggled to help at home became his dexterity was limited to the basic tasks he could perform with a replacement hook. Mr Ackland is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of a four-month trial, which it's hoped will see it made publicly available. Right: Arnold Schwarzenegger's bionic arm in The Terminator . He was approached by Leeds-based prosthetics company, RSLSteeper, in May this year and asked if he would like to trail their latest hand - the most high-tech available in the world. It will be unveiled officially for the first time tomorrow at a launch event in London. The hand features a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual’s requirements. To make it look as natural as possible the hand can be covered with a realistic silicone skin, available in 19 different shades, although Mr Ackland has not been given one for the trial. While the hand has changed his life, he says it still has limitations and the keen musician has not been able to start playing the piano and saxophone again.

While the hand has changed his life, Mr Ackland says it still has limitations - he has not been able to start playing the piano and saxophone again . Mr Ackland said he hopes company bosses will be able to let him keep the arm, or make alternative arrangements for him to get a replacement. He added: 'When you first lose a limb it can take a massive blow to your confidence. People in the street don’t really know how to react to the fact that you have no arm and as a result you can be left feeling exceptionally withdrawn. 'With the Terminator arm people will come up and ask you about it. It is almost like it is science fiction for them which is amazing. For the first time in six years I’m finally back in the loop. 'People notice it when I am just walking along in the street and they come and ask questions.'I don’t really like people feeling sorry for me or shying away from me, so for that not to be happening is life-changing. 'Since I started the trial it has made a massive difference to my day-to-day life and my health as well. 'For example if you have two arms, two hands and you need to pull your trousers on, you can do it in four or five swift moves. 'If you do it one handed you are looking at 18 or 19 moves so your body is forever over worked and run down. 'With the special arm I can hold my dogs lead, hold the vegetables when I’m cutting them and even grab my bank cards. 'It is like being your old-self, with a very cool piece of machinery helping you.'

Facebook: The company's chief privacy officer says users should 'never' have to give out passwords in job interviews . Two U.S senators are calling for an investigation into the practice of asking for Facebook passwords in job interviews so that interviewers can 'look through' accounts for information that might be concealed from the public. The practice, which has horrified privacy campaigners, could be against Federal law. Facebook itself has already said that the practice - which has been documented at several American organisations - is a violation of its terms of use and could potentially lead to legal action. Chuck Schumer, a Democratic senator for New York Schumer, along with Richard Blumenthal, . Democratic senator for Connecticut are calling on the . Department of Justice and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . to investigate the practice. Schumer said, 'In an age where more and more of our . personal information - and our private social interactions - are . online, it is vital that all individuals be allowed to determine for . themselves what personal information they want to make public and . protect personal information from their would-be employers. This is . especially important during the job-seeking process, when all the power . is on one side of the fence,' The practice is already highly controversial. The American Civil Liberties Union who says that the . practice is a clear violation of personal privacy. Facebook's chief privacy officer, . Erin Egan, stepped in on Friday in a post which said, 'If you are a . Facebook user, you should never have to share your password.' The . social networking company says that it would even consider suing firms . that use the practice. It also warns firms could open themselves up to . legal challenges from job candidates. 'We have worked really hard at Facebook to give you the tools to control who sees your information,' says Egan. 'That’s . why we’ve made it a violation of Facebook’s Statement of Rights and . Responsibilities to share or solicit a Facebook password.' Job applicants . at the Maryland Department of Corrections were asked to allow the . interviewer to watch as the applicant logged into Facebook and clicked . through photos, messages, and wall posts that were behind the privacy . wall. In a post on Friday, . Facebook's chief privacy officer cautions that if an employer discovers . that a job applicant is a member of a protected group, the employer may . open itself up to claims of discrimination if it doesn't hire that . person. They say that while ‘shoulder . surfing’, as the practice is called, may technically be voluntary, the . vast majority of applicants feel obligated to open up their lives to . their employers or risk losing the job. Sharing made very easy: Employers are making job candidates list their password information for Facebook and their email accounts on some applications and others are asking them to take them on a tour during the interview . An . extreme case was that of Robert Collins, who had been working for the . Department for years before they asked him to give his email and . Facebook logins. ‘Here I am, a us citizen who hasn’t . broken any laws, who hasn’t committed any crimes, and here I am having a . prospective- well, not prospective in my case- an employer, looking at . my personal communications, my personal posts, my personal identifiable . information,’ he said in a video produced by the ACLU. Others strongly request that . the candidate opens their pages in front of them and allow their . would-be bosses to scroll through their private information during the . interview. Outraged: Robert Collins already worked at the Maryland Department of Corrections when they asked him to hand over all personal login information . ‘It’s an absolute and total invasion and total overreach on their part,’ Mr Collins said. Following . his case, the Department suspended the policy for 45 days before . compromising on ‘shoulder surfing’ as an alternative. Trouble maker: Marvin Austin posted about making very expensive purchases while still a student prompting an NCAA investigation and changed school policies . While . the prospect of revealing the inner workings of your social life seems . daunting, it has only lead to serious consequences in a few cases: of . the 2,689 applicants that the Maryland Department of Corrections . examined, only seven were denied the position based on items . interviewers discovered behind privacy walls. In addition to creating an awkward situation for potential employers, it also forces them to break Facebook policy. ‘You . will not share your password ... let anyone else access your account or . do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account,’ the site’s policy stipulates. Facebook . spokesman Frederic Wolens spoke with MSNBC and while he would not . comment on the specific case of the Maryland Department of Corrections, . he speculated that the practice was against the site’s terms of service. ‘Under our terms, only . the holder of the email address and password is considered the Facebook . account owner. We also prohibit anyone from soliciting the login . information or accessing an account belonging to someone else,’ he told . the news site. In . an effort to avoid this situation, the University of North Carolina has . instated a policy that forces student athletes to ‘friend’ at least one . of their coaches so that they can constantly monitor what the students . put online.

Now BBC Business Editor Robert Peston is in the spotlight again today after revealing a series of stories about the Barclays market-rigging crisis. Mr Peston's stories - which could only have come from a top-level source - have diverted attention away from the bank and on to the Bank of England. They come in the aftermath of revelations that Barclays staff submitted false numbers to the inter-bank lending rate in a bid to improve the bank's borrowing position during the heart of the 2008 financial crisis. The financial news journalist yesterday revealed that Barclays staff apparently made the lower Libor submissions after a telephone call between the Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker and Bob Diamond in 2008. His story effectively turned attention on the Bank of England at a critical time for Barclays as pressure grew on Bob Diamond to resign. Later he was first with news of the resignation of Barclays chairman Marcus Agius, in a move that was hoped to reduce pressure on Mr Diamond to quit. Questions may yet be asked about the timings of such stories. On his BBC blog, he wrote yesterday: 'Mr Agius has told the bank's board he is going - and an announcement will be made tomorrow.' Breaking news: Robert Peston's Tweets on the Barclays Libor-fixing scandal . In September 2007, Mr Peston broke news of Northern Rock's application to the Bank of England for financial support.

Every one of the more than 180 people injured in the Boston Marathon blasts who made it to a hospital alive now seem likely to survive, doctors say. That includes several people who arrived with legs attached by just a little skin, a 3-year-old boy with a head wound and bleeding on the brain, and a little girl riddled with nails. Even a transit system police officer whose heart had stopped and was close to bleeding to death after a shootout with the suspects now appears headed for recovery. Clarity amid confusion: Miraculously, all of the injured people from the Boston Marathon bombing were quickly treated on the scene and rushed to hospitals, allowing them to get the care they needed . 'All I feel is joy,' said Dr. George Velmahos, chief of trauma surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, referring to his hospital's 31 blast patients. 'Whoever came in alive, stayed alive.' Three people did die in the blasts, but at the scene, before hospitals even had a chance to try to save them. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who police say was fatally shot Thursday by the suspects was pronounced dead when he arrived at Massachusetts General. The only person to reach a hospital alive and then die was one of the suspected bombers - 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev. But the remarkable, universal survival . one week later of all others injured in the blasts is a testimonial to . fast care at the scene, on the way to hospitals, then in emergency and . operating rooms. Help: The speed of first responders and volunteers on the scene helped save lives, like that of Jeff Bauman who was seriously injured in one of the blasts . Everyone played a part, from doctors, nurses and paramedics to strangers who took off belts to use as tourniquets and staunched bleeding with their bare hands. As of Monday, 51 people remained hospitalized, three of them in critical condition and five listed as serious. At least 14 people lost all or part of a limb; three of them lost more than one. Two children with leg injuries remain hospitalized at Boston Children's Hospital. A 7-year-old girl is in critical condition and 11-year-old Aaron Hern is in fair condition. The surviving bombing suspect, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is in serious condition at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center with a neck wound. Getting treatment: Boston firefighter James Plourde carried one of the more than 180 injured away from the scene . Triage care: Many emergency workers and volunteers used the old-fashioned method of tourniquets to help stop the bleeding from severely injured limbs . 'Our training, our practicing, went a long way' to minimizing chaos so that hospitals and emergency responders worked effectively to treat the many wounded, said Dr. William Mackey, surgery chief at Tufts Medical Center. 'Trauma care is optimism translated . into action,' said Dr. Russell Nauta, chairman of surgery at Mount . Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, where the wounded transit police officer, . Richard Donohue, remains in stable but critical condition. Doctors and emergency responders approach each patient as someone who can be saved regardless of how severe the injuries appear. And some were very bad. Scars will remain: At least 14 people lost all or part of a limb; three of them lost more than one . 'The legs came hanging on muscles and skin,' said Velmahos, who did three of the four initial amputations on patients in the early hours after the bombs at Massachusetts General. A fifth patient at that hospital had to have an amputation Thursday. Doctors had judged that there was a 5 per cent chance the woman's leg could be saved, so they didn't amputate right away. 'We restored the blood supply to the leg, but all the muscles and nerves were destroyed,' so the leg had to be removed later, he explained. Resolve: A week after the fatal blasts, 51 people remained hospitalized, three of them in critical condition and five listed as serious . Of the remaining five patients at the hospital with severe leg injuries, 'I'm very confident that they will all keep their legs, and even more, that they will have functional legs,' he said. Although doctors are optimistic, some patients still have life-threatening wounds. Complications can range from blood clots to infections. A few still have injuries that could require amputation, said Dr. Michael Yaffe, a trauma surgeon at Beth Israel. 'We have to see how these are going to heal' over the next few weeks, he said. 'Blood supply is key. ... The two biggest enemies we will face in the next two weeks are maintaining a good blood supply and preventing infection.' So far, the progress has been in the right direction. 'Every day they're a little better,' Yaffe said. 'A lot of them have a long road of recovery ahead.'","Doctors expect all of the more than 180 injured at the Boston Marathon bombing to survive .

Men without children are more likely to suffer depression about the issue than their female counterparts . Men without children are more likely to suffer depression about the issue than their female counterparts. British researchers found that men are almost as likely as women to want children, and they feel more isolated, depressed, angry and sad than women if they don't have them. The research, due to be presented at the British Sociological Association annual conference in London today, also found that the influences on men and women who wanted to have children varied. Childless women were more likely to . cite personal desire and biological urge as major influences, compared . to men. Men were more likely to cite cultural, societal and family . pressures than were women. Robin Hadley, of Keele University, found that 59 per cent of men and 63 per cent of women said they wanted children. Of the men who wanted children, half had experienced isolation because they did not have any children, compared with 27 per cent of women. Thirty-eight per cent of men had experienced depression because they did not have any children, compared with only 27 per cent of women. One in four men had experienced anger because they did not have any children, compared with 18 per cent of women, while 56 per cent of men had experienced sadness because they did not have any children, compared with 43 per cent of women. However, no men had experienced guilt because they did not have any children although 16 per cent of women had. Mr Hadley said: 'There is very little research on the desire for fatherhood among men. 'My work shows that there was a similar level of desire for parenthood among childless men and women in the survey, and that men had higher levels of anger, depression, sadness, jealousy and isolation than women and similar level of yearning. 'This challenges the common idea that women are much more likely to want to have children than men, and that they consistently experience a range of negative emotions more deeply than men if they don't have children.' He carried out his survey of 27 men and . 81 women who were not parents using an online questionnaire among people . aged 20 to 66, with an average age of 41. But when it came to men who already had children, the tables were turned. Nearly 60 per cent of mothers wanted more children, compared to 55 per cent of fathers . Just over 80 per cent were white British, 69 per cent had degrees, 69 per cent worked full-time and 90 per cent were heterosexual. But when it came to men who already had children, the tables were turned. Mr Hadley also surveyed another 125 . men and women who already had children to find out whether they wanted . more. He found that 59 per cent of mothers wanted more children, . compared to 55 per cent of fathers. He . said the women who wanted more children, when they thought about not . being able to have them, had higher levels of anger, depression, guilt, . isolation, sadness and yearning than men. In research carried out since his study, Mr Hadley has interviewed involuntary childless men. Among them was Russell who told him: 'I'm 55, the light's been getting dimmer and dimmer and dimmer of me ever being a father, to the point now where it's not going to happen.' George, 60, said: 'If you don't have children or grandchildren then that dimension of your life is missing.' Some men admitted that shyness was a factor in not developing relationships that led to children.","Men are almost as likely as women to want children, say British researchers .

The BBC’s world affairs editor, 67, revealed that he had placed his London townhouse in the trust of a Bahamas-based company overseen by his South African wife Dee Kruger. The plan was to avoid inheritance tax or stamp duty in the event of a future sale of the Chelsea property, which he bought for £1.85million back in 2004, and the offshore scheme was entirely within the law. Avoider: John Simpson, pictured with his wife Dee, said his £1.85million London home . was placed in an off-shore company until he decided to end the legal . arrangement recently . But Simpson, who has reported from 30 . war-torn countries in a career spanning more than 40 years, said he . recently came to the conclusion that paying tax is one of the ‘duties of . a citizen of this country’. He said he had come to his decision before . the recent tax avoidance controversy involving Jimmy Carr and Gary . Barlow became public. Simpson said he had decided to put his . house back under his and his wife’s names – even though doing so could . land him with a six-figure capital gains tax bill in addition to . liability for inheritance tax and stamp duty if he sells the house. Duty: John Simpson, the BBC's World Affairs editor, said it was 'absolutely right' for a citizen of Britain to pay tax to the government of the day - even though it's painful - but he said it was part of a citizen's 'duties' Simpson told the Independent: ‘It’s . absolutely right for a citizen of this country to pay whatever amount of . tax, within reason, the Government of the day feels is required.

Last month, stand-up comedian Carr . issued an apology for his ‘terrible error of judgment’ after it was . revealed that he kept his £3.3million fortune in a legal tax avoidance . scheme in Jersey which saw him pay as little as 1 per cent tax on his . earnings.

It takes a vivid imagination to place the Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile on this skull – but archaeologists are convinced they can. They believe a skeleton unearthed in Florence could have belonged to the woman painted by Leonardo Da Vinci in his masterpiece. Archaeologists who are digging for the remains of the real-life Mona Lisa have found two new female skeletons. The two bodies, one whole, the other . fragmented, were found in the same grave in the basement of the former . convent of St. Ursula. Researchers digging in Florence have discovered two new female skeletons in the search for the Mona Lisa. It is thought that the alleged 'model' for Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa Gherardini, was buried there after his death in 1542. Yesterday's discovery brings the total number of skeletons found to seven. 'If everything goes as planned, we will find Gherardini and with her skull we will be able to reconstruct her face thanks to some sophisticated technology,' Mr Vinceti said yesterday. 'After that we will be able to compare the face to that of Mona Lisa and maybe for the first time will get an answer that will be based on highly sophisticated technology that does not make errors,' he told Sky TV. 'With this reconstruction of the face there is a margin of error between four and eight per cent so we will know whether Leonardo used Gherardini or we will be able to draw other conclusions.' However, one of Gherardini's descendants, the Italian aristocrat Natalia Guicciadini Strozzi, has described the researchers' grave-digging project as a 'sacrilegious act'. 'What difference would finding her remains make to the allure of Leonardo's painting?' she said recently. However, even if the skeletons are not the Mona Lisa, the team has vowed to keep digging. Bodies were buried one on top of the other at the convent - so the team will keep digging, and reaching further back in history. The latest discovery comes amid renewed interest in the painting after the Zurich-based Mona Lisa Foundation unveiled what is known as the 'Isleworth Mona Lisa' to the public, and said mathematical analysis proved it was the hand of the Master at work. But other experts remain unconvinced, with Oxford professor Martin Kemp telling the BBC there is 'no basis for thinking that there was an earlier portrait'. The latest discovery is of two skeletons, believed to be female, laying next to other. Archaeologists have vowed to keep digging at the site, which contains dozens of bodies on top of each other. so far, seven skeletons have been found. Vinceti recently found the body of a wealthy woman. 'The ledgers . kept by the nuns of this convent tell us that, presumably, the remains are those of Maria Del Riccio, a wealthy woman who (died) in 1609,' he told reporters when the discovery was made. But he added that he hoped 'Mona Lisa's' bones 'could be right here'. Lisa Gheradini, was the wife of a . rich silk merchant named Francesco del Giocondo.

They first had to dig through thick concrete, laid down ahead of plans to turn the convent into an army barracks. If they do find the body of Lisa . Gherardini, the team hopes to extract her DNA to confirm her identity - . comparing it to the DNA of her two children buried elsewhere. Then they will use facial reconstruction techniques to compare her face to that of the iconic painting. However some researchers have . criticised the research, saying the pace of the expedition means error . may be made - such as the team not mapping out where bones and other . items are found, ruining evidence such as the spatial relationships . between different bodies. An archeologist works next to one of the two new skeletons found today during the 'hunt' of the remains of the alleged 'model' for Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa Gherardini. LiveScience quoted University of North . Carolina anthropologist Kristina Killgrove, who said: 'Although the . excavation is being carried out in a professional manner, Vinceti’s . quest to dig up the 'real' Mona Lisa is not grounded in scientific . research methodology. 'The news media’s breathless coverage . of it threatens to signal to the public that archaeologists are . frivolous with their time, energy and research money.'

A juror halted a sex assault case just 24 hours after the Tyne and Wear derby when he branded the defendant a 'Mackem rapist'. The man, a Newcastle United fan, is understood to have said he could not give David Blake, from Sunderland, a fair trial so soon after his city's team beat Newcastle 3-0 last weekend. The juror confessed his concerns to court staff and admitted his prejudice before Judge Penny Moreland. Newcastle United lost at home to Sunderland at St James' Park last Sunday, which prompted the juror to say he could not give David Blake a fair trial . The juror, a Newcastle fan, branded Blake a 'Mackem rapist' in the wake of Sunday's Tyne and Wear derby match . As a result, before hearing any evidence from the witness box, he was removed from the panel of jurors. Jurors are given clear a clear warning by judges at the start of every case that they must try defendants on the evidence they hear in court and nothing else. Blake's trial was halted after just half a day, meaning the victim, who was anxiously waiting to give evidence, faced a delay while a new jury was sworn in. The juror was told not to come back to court to complete his fortnight of jury service. As a result of the false start, Blake's victim had to re-live her ordeal by watching her video evidence a second time when it was shown again for the benefit of the new jury. Blake, of North Farm Avenue, Sunderland, who had pleaded not guilty, was eventually found guilty of raping the woman - who had fallen asleep in a spare bed, alone, after a party at a flat. Prosecutor James Adkin told the court the 44-year-old attacker took advantage of his victim's drunk and sleeping state. Mr Adkin said: 'She woke up at about 8am and to her horror she realised the defendant was having sex with her. The juror was dismissed from the panel at Newcastle Crown Court and a new jury sworn in . 'She immediately told him to get off.' When his victim contacted the police minutes after the attack, Blake told officers: 'I started to kiss her, had sex with her, then she woke up.' He later denied confessing and claimed he had said 'she was awake'. Jurors rejected Blake's claim the woman had performed a sex act on him while he was sleeping, which led to them having consensual sex when he woke up. Blake will be sentenced next month and was remanded in custody in the meantime. Judge Moreland warned him: 'I require a report from the probation service to assist with what risk you pose to others. The sentence is inevitable.'","Juror branded David Blake, a 'Mackem rapist' at Newcastle Crown Court .

It is one of Angelina Jolie’s favourite photographs, an inspirational and iconic image of defiance and pride in the face of danger. Taken by award-winning British photojournalist Tom Stoddart at the height of the Balkans war in a suburb of Sarajevo haunted by snipers, the woman walks tall in her heels and best clothes refusing to cower to the gunmen of Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic who daily picked-off their targets from the hills above the city. Make-up was unobtainable in the besieged and shattered Bosnian capital, yet Meliha Vareshanovic had somehow made her own lipstick and eye-liner and would daily walk through the frontlines clutching her handbag, past the sandbagged positions and local defence forces in a remarkable example of the human spirit in adversity. 'You will never defeat us': Meliha Vareshanovic walks proudly and defiantly to work in the dangerous suburb of Dobrinja during the siege of Sarajevo in Angelina Jolie's favourite photograph . Haunting images: Sarajevans run for cover during shooting in 'Sniper Alley' in 1992, when award-winning British photojournalist Tom Stoddart immersed himself in the action at the height of the Balkans war .

Tears of anguish: A mother prepares to send her confused child out of Sarajevo on a bus promised safe passage by the Serb forces during the siege in 1992 . In a city of desperate people who . braved the streets behind sniper blankets, Vareshanovic stood out among a . population whose clothes and faces were scarred by war. Such . was the impact of the photograph that it is said to have ‘inspired’ Hollywood star Jolie when she was making the acclaimed and controversial . film Land of Blood and Honey. A large print of the photograph hung on . the wall of her suite as she edited the film. Inspiration: British photojournalist Tom Stoddart (left) chronicled the everyday bravery of people in war zones, inspiring Angelina Jolie (right, with an elderly Bosnian woman).

Promising young gymnasts are taken away from their homes – their parents can see their children as little as once a year – and put into strict training camps, sharing accommodation and working on repetition exercises for hours each day.

Other works attracting comment are . Stoddart’s pictures of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the historic . election of Nelson Mandela, the aftermath of the tsunami and the . devastation of Lockerbie. However, . for many it is the images from the Balkans – Stoddart spent four years . there during the conflict and was badly injured when caught in the . fighting – that have resonated with visitors. One . graphic picture that stays with many is of a mother, her face stained . with tears as, desperate that her child should escape Sarajevo, she . reaches up to give her little boy to a stranger on a bus allowed through . the front lines. She doesn’t know whether she will ever see the boy . again and it is a heartbreaking moment of uncertainty with which any . parent could identify.

Norman Tebbit today revealed his great regret at quitting Margaret Thatcher's government, leaving her 'at the mercy of her friends'. The former Tory party chairman bemoaned how Baroness Thatcher was ousted from power not by the voters but by her Conservative colleagues. Staring down the chamber towards former Foreign Secretary, Lord Howe of Aberavon, whose dramatic resignation sparked the Iron Lady's political demise in 1990, Lord Tebbit told peers he wished he had stood by her. Scroll down for video . Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit recalled the Brighton bombing in which he and his wife were injured, and expressed regret that Baroness Thatcher was ousted from power by her own Conservative colleagues . Packed: The chamber of the House of Lords was packed this afternoon as peers paid tribute and criticised Baroness Thatcher . He also spoke movingly of the IRA bomb in 1984, in which he was injured and his wife Margaret was paralysed. Three years later he stood down from the Cabinet, to look after his wife. He told the Lords: 'My regrets? I think I do regret that . because of the commitments I had made to my own wife that I did not feel . able either to continue in Government after 1987 or to return to . Government when she later asked me to do and I left her, I fear, at the . mercy of her friends. That I do regret.' He added that he was grateful for how she allowed him to run his office 'from my hospital bed' for three months while he recovered from his injuries. Baroness Thatcher joined the House of Lords in 1992 after standing down as an MP . 'I would like to say how . grateful I will always be for the fact that she gave me the opportunity . to serve in high office the country that she and I, and I believe all of . us here, love,' he said. And in a swipe at the Tory MPs who refused to back her as leader in 1990, Lord Tebbit said: 'She was brought . down in the end not by the electorate, but by her colleagues. 'Not only is it quite . remarkable that she won three elections running - someone else has done . that since - what was remarkable is that she polled slightly more votes . on the occasion of her third victory when she had been in office eight . years than on her first and I regard that as a triumph for her.'He said his life as Conservative Party chairman was made much easier by 'the certainty of her beliefs'. 'I was never asked by her to commission a focus group,"" he said. 'Had I been so, I would have resisted manfully.' But he said he had not always agreed with her. 'I recollect one occasion when I left her office in No 10, walked back over to Victoria Street, got into my office and asked my private secretary if there had been any calls from No 10. 'No, secretary of state,' he said. So I knew I was still the secretary of state.' Former Tory leader Lord Howard of Lympne said: 'There are very, very few people who have made a difference on the scale Margaret Thatcher achieved. She saved our country, she helped bring freedom to half our continent. The light of her legacy will shine like a beacon down the generations.' He added: 'It has said many times that she was a divisive figure. She was, she had to be. There was no consensus about the right thing to do to save our country. 'And if she had waited for consensus nothing would ever have happened. She saw what needed to be done and she did it, with clarity, with courage, with conviction.' Conservative leader in the Lords, Lord Hill, lead the debate telling peers: 'Whatever our views and whatever our backgrounds, I think we would all agree that she made a huge difference to the country she loved, that she helped to pick Britain up off its knees, that she changed our place in the world and that she transformed the very shape of our political debate. 'And I think we would also agree that she was a staunch defender of our parliamentary system and the part it should play in our national life.' Speeches: Lord Howard and Lord Ashdown also took to their feet to praise the Iron Lady and share memories . Former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown hailed Baroness Thatcher as 'without doubt the commanding politician and greatest Prime Minister of our age'. Lord Ashdown said she restored the UK's position in the world and was far better than any man in politics. And he revealed the surprise reaction of his left-leaning wife, Jane, on meeting Baroness Thatcher at a Downing Street reception. Lady Ashdown remarked: 'She's absolutely bloody charming, dammit!' Lord McNally, in a speech peppered . with humour and greeted with warm laughter from many in the House, . recalled sitting next to Lady Thatcher in 2003, the year her husband . died and a year after she suffered a series of minor strokes. 'By some reason of serendipity for . about five years, at the state opening of Parliament, I found myself . sitting on that bench there next to Mrs Thatcher and spending time with . her before we awaited the Queen's arrival,' the leader of the Lib Dems . in the Lords said. 'The one thing I want to share with . the House was in the year her husband died and when she had already had a . number of minor strokes and she didn't speak a great deal. 'But suddenly she turned to me and said 'My husband died earlier this year'. 'And I said 'Yes, I know Baroness Thatcher'. 'She paused again and then said ""I miss him very much"".' Tribute: One peer, Lord McNally, described how Lady Thatcher and Denis were a 'tremendous partnership' and told how, after he died, the former PM said how much she missed her husband . Mr Thatcher was 'absolutely central' and key to Lady Thatcher's ability to become what she was, Baroness Williams said. 'According to Sir Denis Thatcher, at one stage he was sitting at home in his flat in Flood Street and Mrs Thatcher was ironing his shirt, something she was very keen on doing, getting breakfast, ironing his shirt,' Lady Williams said. 'She said in a rather casual sort of way 'Denis, I'm thinking of running for the leadership', to which he responded 'leadership of what Margaret?' 'That somehow summed up the wonderful balance, detachment and humour of Sir Denis and I can't undermine too strongly the extent to which I think Mrs Thatcher began to lose her life when he passed away. 'He was absolutely central and key to her whole personality, the ability to become what she was.' Lady Williams, who sat opposite Lady Thatcher on the Commons front benches as a Labour minister during the 1970s, said she disagreed with her policies which were 'terribly hard on the industrial North and the industrial Midlands'. She also criticised Lady Thatcher for not embracing other cultures. 'I think her policies did not completely reflect the common ground that we were beginning to develop as a multi-cultural and multi-racial nation and to me that is a very important part of what we are about today.' Views: Baroness Williams also spoke movingly about Margaret Thatcher's relationship with Denis and his unfailing support for her in their 52 years of marriage . Labour's Baroness Royall of Blaisdon admitted that many on the left still feel angry towards Baroness Thatcher, even three decades after she became Prime Minister. 'For some, including some on my benches and in my part of the political spectrum, Mrs Thatcher, as she was then, was someone who was a divisive figure, someone to whom they were and remain fundamentally opposed,' the Labour peer said. 'Someone whose very name, even now, more than 30 years since she became Britain's prime minister in 1979, can raise heights of emotion, of passion, of anger, despair, and more. Someone who they believe can never be forgiven for what she did to individuals, to communities, to industries, and to the country. 'That is a legitimate position of disagreement to hold - but to hold parties to celebrate a death of someone is wrong and in bad taste, and something I deplore.'","Former Tory chairman pays tribute to Margaret Thatcher in Lords debate .

A mother ordered to remove an old armchair from her front garden took revenge on the council by transforming the yard into an outdoor living room. Debbie Ballard, 47, claims she put the furniture outside while she saved up to have it taken away from her property in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. When Southend Council demanded that she removes it from her garden, she protested by putting out more items including a mock fireplace. Outdoor living room: Debbie Ballard created this 'garden room' when Southend Council complained about her armchair being left outside . Artistic creation: Debbie Ballard said passers by have been taking pictures of her creation in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex . After she made the jokey gesture, people have been stopping outside her home to take pictures of her creation. Some people have even described mother-of-two Ms Ballard as 'The Tracey Emin of Westcliff' after the famed Brit artist who hit the headlines with her creation 'My Bed'. She said: 'People have been knocking on my door and asking what it is all about. I have also had passers-by stopping outside and taking photos.' The former IT manager said she was initially angered by the council's letter telling her that the armchair was 'rubbish' and had to be removed within 14 days. She argued that the surrounding roads are full of rubbish and broken furniture and called on the authority to concentrate on street cleaning instead. Feet up: Debbie Ballard enjoys an outdoor cup of tea in her outdoor living room in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex . Ms Ballard has placed a blanket over a raised flowerbed to create a living room table and there is a sheet covering the front window which gives the impression of wallpaper. The framed photos on the 'wall' have pictures of her pets in them. Her neighbours have spoken out in favour of the changes and so far no-one has complained directly to her other than council officials. David Lynam said: 'It looks like something from artist Tracey Emin. It is certainly very eye-catching when you pass.' And Milena Chirwa said: 'It is crazy - I was going to take a photo of what she has done there. 'She is taking the mickey out of the council with it.' Decor: Debbie claims she left the armchair outside because she was saving up to have it taken away . Ms Ballard said she had no plans to remove the furniture and is hoping the council will do a u-turn on its policy. She said she could not afford to pay for the armchair to be removed and also questioned what should constitute 'garden furniture'. A spokesman for Southend Council said it would welcome 'dialogue' with Ms Ballard if she could not afford to have the chair removed. A spokesman said: 'People have complained, so we have to have a chat with her about it. And if she wants to create an art space, she is welcome to speak with our arts' officer.'","Debbie Ballard, 47, claims she is saving up to have the furniture taken away .

A woman who posted negative feedback on eBay when her order arrived owing postage is being sued by the seller after she refused to remove her criticism. Amy Nicholls, of Greenville, South Carolina, was disappointed at having to pay for postage and the seller, Ohio-based Med Express, its first negative feedback. Now the firm, which is believed to sell medical supplies entirely though the internet auction site, is claiming her criticism may damage their business - even though it is true - and is suing Ms Nicholls for defamation. eBay feedback: Ms Nicholls' seemingly innocuous comment sparked a lawsuit from Ohio-based firm, Med Express . The row began in February when Ms Nicholls bought a microscope light source for $175, plus $12 shipping costs, from Med Express Inc, which trades on eBay as med_express_sales. When the package arrived with postage due of around $1.40, Ms Nicholls paid it but then went onto eBay and gave Med Express a negative rating. She wrote: 'Order arrived with postage due with no communication from seller beforehand.' According to Public Citizen Litigation Group, Med Express offered to refund her the extra charge, and asked her to remove her negative comment. Ms Nicholls refused, because her comment was correct and because she was more annoyed by the inconvenience of having to pay extra postage than the amount itself. At this point Med Express, which has its headquarters in Medina, OH, and which has only one negative review compared to around 140 positive reviews in the last six months, sued. Microscope light that began a lawsuit: Ms Nicholls purchased this $175 light on eBay and paid $12 postage . They admitted that the comment was correct, but said that she should remove her comment because it could be detrimental to their sales. The firm also requested a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against eBay in that hope that it would have the comment removed.  A judge denied the TRO. Rather than back down, Ms Nicholls is now being helped in her case by Public Citizen Litigation Group. Lawyers for Med Express filed a defamation suit against Ms Nicholls and requested an order be granted to force eBay to take the comment down .

A university student was stabbed to death after argument with religious vigilantes who attacked him for walking with his fiancee. Three bearded men approached Ahmed Hussein Eid and his partner when they were walking in a park in Suez, Egypt and demanded they go their separate ways because they were not married, security officials said. An argument broke out which ended with one of the men fatally stabbing the engineering student in his left thigh. He was taken to Ismailia University Hospital but later died of his injuries.

Little hero: Aaron Green, 3, managed to save his mums life by calling for help using her mobile phone, despite having never used one before . A three-year-old boy saved his mother’s life by calling for help using her mobile phone - despite having never used one before. Little Aaron Green somehow managed to call his great-grandmother when his mother Cally, 26, had a diabetic seizure. The barmaid, from Coventry, West Midlands, had just finished a night shift at when she returned home and was gripped by a hypoglycemic attack which caused her to collapse. Little Aaron found her the next morning lying on the floor of her bedroom and was unable to wake her. The little boy - who does not yet know the alphabet and can only just count to ten -reached for his mother’s Blackberry phone which was lying on her bed. It is thought he knew what to do with the phone by watching his mother use it. He managed to scroll through the electronic address book, found his great grandmother and called her to say: 'Mummy’s sick. She’s very ill. Please come and help her.' Her grandmother then immediately called Miss Green’s best friend, Kara McCoy, 18, who lives on the same street who ran to the house. After finding the mother of one completely unresponsive, she phoned 999 and an ambulance crew rushed to her aid. Six paramedics spent over two hours trying to revive Miss Green before she was taken to University Hospital Coventry. She spent five days in an induced coma and awoke with no memory of what had happened. Mother Cally, 26, had a diabetic seizure which caused her to collapse. Aaron was able to get her urgent medical attention . She was later told she would probably have died if it had not been for Aaron’s brave actions. She said: 'If it wasn’t for Aaron I wouldn’t be here now. I’m always nattering away on the phone so he must have seen me do that enough times and copied me. 'I’m a real chatterbox, it’s annoys all my friends but it must have been teaching him something useful. 'It’s amazing as he doesn’t know the alphabet and can barely count to ten. 'I don’t know how he did it. He managed to unlock my mobile phone, go to the address book and go straight to my nan, who brought me up, of all people. 'I find that mobile hard to use myself. The doctors said I was lucky to be alive. 'It feels like I must have been watched over by a guardian angel who was guiding him through what to do. 'I owe him everything - he deserves the world. I want everyone to know what a Superman he is.' Miss McCoy added: 'I’ve got a key to the house, so I let myself in. 'Cally was on the bedroom floor. She must have fallen off the bed. I was scared, I didn’t know what to do. I felt helpless. 'She was moving but wouldn’t respond so I called the ambulance. Aaron was very brave and calm you wouldn’t know his age, he was coping better than me.' The youngster received a bravery badge from his nursery in recognition of his efforts.","Little Aaron Green managed to call for help when his mother had a diabetic seizure .

Rising numbers of middle-class children are suffering mental health problems amid a trend for risk-averse parents  to raise them ‘in captivity’, a leading psychologist warns. Professor Tanya Byron said youngsters are growing up in a ‘paranoid’ culture which tries to protect them but leaves them unable to cope with life’s challenges. She said she was treating increasing numbers of children with anxiety disorders who lack ‘emotional resilience’ and are afraid of failure. Warning: Professor Tanya Byron said youngsters are growing up in a ¿paranoid¿ culture which tries to protect them but leaves them unable to cope with life¿s challenges . Professor Byron, who has been a clinical psychologist for 23 years and featured on the BBC series House Of Tiny Tearaways, said these children were ‘breaking down’ despite being ‘bright’ and not ‘from backgrounds where you would predict a greater chance of them having emotional, psychological or mental health problems’. ‘There is a real concern that we have a generation of children and young people who are lacking massively in emotional resilience,’ she said. Professor Byron said a prevalent ‘risk-averse culture’ was doing children a huge disservice. ‘Children are being raised in captivity,’ she told the teachers’ journal SecEd. ‘When was the last time you saw a kid out enjoying themselves on their bike? ‘Children are not really encouraged, supported or taught how to assess, take and manage risk and I think  that it is developmentally catastrophic for them. ‘We live in a litigious, risk-averse culture where paranoia is rife and we have an education system that is so built around targets and testing that teachers and head teachers are constrained from being innovative. ‘But risk-taking is important because it helps children to accept, understand and embrace failure. ‘The times when you fail are often the most powerful learning experiences one can ever have.’ She added: ‘Obviously I’m not saying that we should just let all our kids fail and take them skate-boarding and mountain-climbing instead, but it does question the education system... and the way we teach children.’","Youngsters growing up in a ‘paranoid’ culture .

You wouldn’t believe it was the same time of year… As Britain endures its coldest March since 1963, it’s hard to think that just 12 months ago we were basking in the sunniest March since 1929. As our pictures show, then sunseekers flocked to beaches, and even northern Scotland enjoyed temperatures exceeding 22C. Yesterday it peaked at 2C amid the snow. Whatever will the climate deal us next? Last year Tara Hammett made the most of the warm weather strolling by the sea in Langland Bay, near Swansea, south Wales . One year on Clare Mitchell strolled on the beach in Langland Bay, near Swansea, south Wales on a wet and freezing cold morning in March . Meanwhile health chiefs have declared winter officially over – just as millions shiver through the bitter cold snap. The Department of Health said on Friday it was shutting down its Winterwatch health-monitoring service ‘because spring is on its way’. As the country was battered by snowstorms, floods and freezing temperatures, the department ended its regular updates on how to cope in winter and its  flu-monitoring service. ‘Winterwatch was scheduled  to end at this time,’ said a spokesman. ‘It’s down to the calendar, not based on the weather, though I’m not sure we expected it to be as cold as this.’ The department’s cold weather plan . for the NHS is still in force. This provides advice to hospitals and . doctors on how to prepare and respond to severe weather. The Army has also decreed summer has . arrived. Guardsmen were ordered to swap their greatcoats for red tunics . at Buckingham Palace and St James’s Palace yesterday. And Household . Cavalry troopers switched to a shorter cape. Lieutenant . Colonel Dino Bossi, of the Welsh Guards, said: ‘The soldiers have spent . the winter enduring some pretty bad conditions out there and I hope the . weather gods welcome the added splash of colour and smile on us.’ In 2012 a depth indicator showed the lack of water on a ford of the River Pang, but now pictures show it flooded under 2ft of water . Despite winter having officially ended bookies have slashed their odds on a white Easter. A record number of bets have been taken in the past  48 hours on snow . falling next weekend, forcing one firm, Ladbrokes, to cut their odds to . 4/5. ‘We’ve never seen so many bets on a white Easter,’ said Ladbrokes’ Alex Donohue. ‘People up and down the land are banking on the snowfall continuing into next weekend.’ The firm has also halved the odds on the Queen wearing snowshoes to the . traditional Easter Sunday service at Windsor to 50/1, with snow in May . at 33/1 and June/July at 66/1. The relentless bad weather has caused the national mood to plummet, according to experts. Some 55,000 people rated their state of happiness between 0 and 100, as well as what they were doing, on an iPhone app called Mappiness. The app then correlated the data with the weather at the user’s location. Researchers from the London School of Economics and University College London found that cold, wet weather in Britain has a measurable effect on the population’s mood. In March 2012 Brighton beach was rammed with families enjoying the unusually hot springtime weather . In freezing temperatures Brighton beach was deserted yesterday compared to one year ago . Rain, on average, lowers people’s happiness by 1.4 points, while a lack of sunshine cuts it by another half point. High winds lower it by a further one point. Dr George MacKerron, one of the project’s designers, said: ‘We certainly find significant weather effects. Given that people don’t have  control of the weather, we’re pretty sure this  is a causal relationship.’ As a result of our wintry blues many of us are seeking out warming comfort food, according to sales figures from supermarkets. M&S has seen soup sales rise by 70 per cent, while warming roast . joints are up 32 per cent compared with last year’s warmer March. Sales of hot puddings were also up ten per cent.

Bono's wealth soared today as Facebook floated on the stock exchange - boosting his stunning portfolio which includes properties, shares and even a Broadway show. The Irish rocker's investment company Elevation Partners holds a 2.3 per cent stake in the social networking site which is now worth in excess of $1.5billion. The company paid $90million for the shares in 2009 but they have rocketed in value. Elevation: The IPO will make Bono the richest pop star in the world. But the move to place Facebook on the stock market has has evoked almost as many shivers of fear in the business world as it has gasps of excitement . Today, as Facebook launched on the Nasdaq stock exchange with a valuation of $104billion, it made more than 1,000 new millionaires - and investors such as Bono even richer. It is a staggering market value - bigger than US manufacturing giants Ford and Boeing combined, and all the more incredible given that the site currently earns a fraction of what those ‘old world’ companies do. There are nine other directors of Elevation Partners and it is thought that Bono owns a little over 10 per cent of the $1.5billion stake. His band U2 are already worth $813million according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Although today will be a beautiful day for Bono, it is unclear exactly how much he is personally worth. Wealth: Bono's house in Killiney, Ireland, which had its roof removed to add a second floor and new roof terraces. He owns a number of other properties around the world . His investment company Elevation Partners, named after a U2 song, was set up in 2004 with five former senior figures from the world of business, including the former chief financial officer of Apple Computers. On top of his pot of social networking gold, Bono holds a portfolio of properties, cars and other investments. Although his investment company has seen their Facebook shares soar in value, the luck of the Irish deserted Bono when the group injected cash into smartphone manufacturer Palm in 2007. Elevation invested $480m in the firm, only to see Apple’s iPhone take the market by storm and bring Palm to its knees. They did get their money back, however, when Hewlett-Packard snapped up Palm on the cheap, as Elevation had ring-fenced their investment with a clause that guaranteed reimbursement if it was sold. French bolthole: A coastal property Bono owns in Eze-sur-Mer, France, along with other homes in Ireland and New York . Bono’s investments then got tangled in the sticky web of the Broadway Spider-Man musical, which was panned by the critics and plagued by a series of accidents. It is understood U2 invested $65million in it, which some might say was sheer folly. Though in the long run, now that the show is up and running smoothly, it could well be a money spinner. It’s not likely that Bono lost an awful lot of sleep over his investments anyway, since the money he’s made from performing is vast. Beyond his complex financial interests, the rocker has a property portfolio that includes a villa in the Southof France and a lavish Italian-style palazzo overlooking the seanear Dublin, not to mention the £15million penthouse onManhattan's Upper West side he bought from Apple founder SteveJobs. Facebook launch: Mark Zuckerberg (centre) remotely rings the Nasdaq bell as Facebook is launched on the Nasdaq stock exchange creating 1,000 new millionaires - and making Bono even richer . Lack of respect: Zuckerberg is known to turn up to meetings with investors wearing a hoody and jeans . The apartment, which takes up two floors of the 27-storey northtower of the ultra-exclusive San Remo building, is listed as one ofNew York's top 40 properties and boasts 12ft nickel and bronzedoors and floor-to-ceiling windows costing £40,000 each. The building, which is also home to Steven Spielberg, is soselect that its management committee once blackballed Madonna'sattempts to move in. Having said that, those who have visited describe Bono'sapartment, with its avant-garde stone walls and floors, as'charmless and stark'. Despite its huge sun terrace with stunning views of CentralPark, one visitor commented: 'It has absolutely no warmth.' Meanwhile, on top of his own lavish property in the upmarketKilliney district of Dublin - which he shares with his wife Ali and four children. When he decided it wasn't big enough, the star paid £3million eight years ago to buy a neighbour's house and linked the two with a corridor. Bono, whose real name is Paul Hewson, also counts a family-sizedMaserati among his fleet of luxury cars and is known for his tastefor fine food. He is also a noted wine connoisseur, who willregularly spend thousands on a single bottle at his favourite NewYork restaurants. He and the three other members of U2, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullenand guitarist David 'The Edge' Evans, also invested in Vertigo3, an Airbus A320, to fly them around in style.","U2 rocker's investment company Elevation Partners have 2.3% stake in Facebook worth $1.5bn .

"By . Damien Gayle . UPDATED: . 11:48 EST, 2 September 2011 . Deposed Libyan despot Colonel Muammar Gaddafi last night called on his followers to begin a 'guerilla war' against the rebel forces which have deposed him. In a fiery broadcast from his desert hiding place, the colonel warned that loyalist tribes in his remaining strongholds were armed and preparing for battle. 'We will fight them everywhere,' he said. 'We will burn the ground under their feet.' An image grab from Syrian-based Arrai television shows a picture of Muammar Gaddafi as he allegedly gives an audio message yesterday to mark the 42nd anniversary of the coup which brought him to power. Writing on screen reads in Arabic 'Libyan combatant leader Muammar Gaddafi: men and women of Libya prepare to resist as your grandfathers and fathers did before you... Prepare for a long war that was imposed on us.' Gaddafi told listeners that the rebellion against his 42-year rule was a plot by Nato, who planned to occupy Libya and steal its oil wealth. 'Get ready for the occupation. ... Get ready for a long war, imposed on us,' he railed. 'Get ready for the guerilla war.' The city of Sirte, a stronghold of the Gaddafi clan and the colonel's hometown, had become 'the capital of the resistance', he said. The rebels, led by the east-Libya based National Transitional Council, dismissed the fugitive leader's threats as empty rhetoric. But they have extended a deadline for the surrender of Sirte in the hope of avoiding the bloodshed that met their attack on Tripoli. 'We want to save our fighters and not lose a single one in battles with Gaddafi's forces,' said Mohammed al-Rajali, a spokesman for the rebel leadership in Benghazi. 'In the end, we will get Sirte, even if we have to cut water and electricity.' Free at last: Libyan women celebrate at Martyrs Square in Tripoli yesterday . The rebels have been hunting Gaddafi since he fled into hiding after they swept into Tripoli on August 20 and, after days of fierce fighting, gained control of most of the capital. They claim the advance on Sirte is going well, and that their forces have already captured one nearby city. They also claim they are closing in on . Gaddafi, who came to power 42 years ago Thursday in a military coup . that toppled the western-backed King Idris. Wanted: A page from a Libyan newspaper shows Gaddafi in a photo digitally altered to make him appear bald in case he has changed his appearance . But the on-the-run dictator remained defiant. 'We won't surrender again; we are not women. We will keep fighting,' Gaddafi earlier said in a blustery tone in an audio statement, broadcast by Syrian-based Al-Rai TV. His voice was recognisable, and Al-Rai has previously broadcast statements by Gadhafi and his sons. Gaddafi claimed the tribes in Sirte and Bani Walid are armed and 'there is no way they will submit.' Calling for continued resistance, he warned: 'the battle will be long and let Libya burn.' The rebels believe Gaddafi may be hiding out in one of their three key targets. Their fighters, backed by Nato airstrikes, have been pushing recently toward Sirte as well as Bani Walid, 90 miles south-east of Tripoli, and the southern city of Sabha. The colonel's forces still control most of Sabha and large numbers of soldiers - including mercenaries from other African countries - are camped on its outskirts, said Abdul Awidat, a Sabha resident currently in Tripoli. Mr Awidat said he had spoken to people in the Sabha area by phone in the past two days who said pro-Gaddafi fores had taken up positions in the city. They are recruiting young men as fighters and handing out weapons but, he added, 'there is no information that Gaddafi or any of his senior leadership are in Sabha.' Some anti-government protesters have taken over a small part of the town of Gorda, and there has been fighting in the area with several people killed, Awidat said. He said there is no electricity, running water or regular telephone service, and medicine is running out. Rebirth of a nation: Residents of Jamal Goubtan district in Tripoli hold a giant former Libyan flag for the cars driving through the city streets . Many rebels now believe Gaddafi could be evading capture by moving underground in his 'Great Man-Made River', the project which allowed him to pump water from 2,500ft below the Sahara Desert and transport it to towns and cities on the Mediterranean coast. It is thought he may have used the huge subterranean network to flee Tripoli without being spotted. The 15ft pipelines dwarf the network of tunnels which have been discovered under the Gaddafi compound in central Tripoli, which are thought to extend for several miles. The irrigation system connects Tripoli with a network of towns including Bani Walid in the south – where several members of the Gaddafi family have been spotted since Tripoli fell under rebel control. Gaddafi loyalists still control Bani Walid, and rebels claim the soldiers turned off the pipeline temporarily to allow the family to escape, disrupting Tripoli’s water supply. In a boost to the rebel cause, the last prime minister under Gaddafi, Al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi, yesterday told Al-Arabiya television he now supports the opposition. He said he had been in contact with the rebels 'and we notified them that we are with the people and we are ready to serve our country in the future.' Meanwhile, Ahmed Said, an adviser to the interior minister in the rebels' interim government, said Gaddafi's foreign minister had been captured. He did not identify him by name, but 'can confirm that he is in custody.' And in a further blow to Gaddafi, Algeria, which gave refuge to his wife and three of his children this week, has indicated it will not do the same for the longtime dictator. The Algerian newspaper El Watan reported Gaddafi had also sought sanctuary in Algeria, but the president refused to take his phone calls. Asked yesterday if Gaddafi could be given asylum, Algerian foreign minister Mourad Medelci said: 'I don't believe so.' Plans for the future: From left, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, Libyan Transitional National Council Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, Libyan National Transitional Council chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Prime Minister David Cameron and Qatar's Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani at a joint press conference during the 'New Libya Conference' held at the Elysee Palace in Paris . In Paris, international leaders gathered yesterday for the 'Friends of Libya' summit to discuss support for the country's interim government. Prime Minister David Cameron insisted Libya was on the 'brink of success' after more than 60 representatives from Nato and the UN made a series of commitments to help support the new Libyan goverment. They include continuing with Nato operations, bringing those guilty of war crimes to justice and supporting the NTC to achieve political transition. Mr Cameron, who chaired the summit with French president Nicolas Sarkozy, said the commitments made at the summit yesterday were right because 'we cannot have a failed, pariah state on Europe's borders'. The conference, held in the Elysee Palace, unanimously agreed the need to hand over frozen Libyan assets to the NTC. International assistance is desperately needed in Libya, which faces critical shortages of drinking water, food, fuel and medicine, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator for the country has said. The six-month conflict between rebels and Gaddafi's forces has seriously disrupted supply lines and devastated the country's infrastructure. Panos Moumtzis said more than half a dozen UN agencies have returned to Tripoli to address the country's humanitarian needs since fighting in the capital waned last week. Mr Moumtzis said the UN has brought in 11million bottles of water and will bring in 600 metric tons of food and £88million worth of medicine. He said, however, that he sees the UN aid as temporary, and that he expects oil-rich Libya to be able fund its own recovery starting in 2012.","Recorded address marked the 42nd anniversary of Gaddafi's rise to power .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 08:28 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:40 EST, 17 May 2012 . More than 900 million people worldwide check their Facebook accounts at least once a month, but millions more are Facebook holdouts. They say they don't want Facebook. They insist they don't need Facebook. They say they're living life just fine without the long-forgotten acquaintances that the world's largest social network sometimes resurrects. They are the resisters. No thanks: Len Kleinrock, 77, arguably the world's first Internet user, says Facebook is fine for his grandchildren, but it's not for him; he is pictured in 2009 . Don't try to friend MaLi Arwood on Facebook. You won't find her there. You won't find Thomas Chin, either. Or Kariann Goldschmitt. Or Jake Edelstein. 'I'm absolutely in touch with everyone in my life that I want to be in touch with,' Ms Arwood says. 'I don't need to share triviality with someone that I might have known for six months 12 years ago.' Even without people like Ms Arwood, Facebook is one of the biggest business success stories in history. The site had one million users by the end of 2004, the year Mark Zuckerberg started it in his Harvard dorm room. Two years later, it had 12 million. Facebook had 500 million by summer 2010 and 901 million as of March 31, according to the company. That staggering rise in popularity is one reason why Facebook Inc.'s initial public offering is one of the most hotly anticipated in years. The company's shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Friday under the ticker symbol 'FB'. Facebook is likely to have an estimated market valuation of some $100 billion, making it worth more than Kraft Foods, Ford or Disney. Well-served: This is the Facebook server room at the company's data centre in Prineville, Oregon; the social network estimates Facebook has 901million users worldwide . Facebook still has plenty of room to grow, particularly in developing countries where people are only starting to get Internet access. As it is, about 80 per cent of its users are outside U.S. and Canada. But if Facebook is to live up to its pre-IPO hype and reward the investors who are clamouring for its stock this week, it needs to convince some of the resisters to join. Two out of every five American adults have not joined Facebook, according to a recent Associated Press-CNBC poll. Among those who are not on Facebook, a third cited a lack of interest or need. If all those people continue to shun Facebook, the social network could become akin to a postal system that only delivers mail to houses on one side of the street. The system isn't as useful, and people aren't apt to spend as much time with it. That means fewer opportunities for Facebook to sell ads. Some people don't join the social network because they don't have a computer or Internet access, are concerned about privacy, or generally dislike Facebook. Those without a college education are less likely to be on Facebook, as are those with lower incomes. Women who choose to skip Facebook are more likely than men to cite privacy issues, while seniors are more likely than those 50-64 years old to cite computer issues, according the AP-CNBC poll. About three-quarters of seniors are not on Facebook. By contrast, more than half of those under 35 use it every day. The poll of 1,004 adults nationwide was conducted by GfK Roper Public Affairs and Corporate Communications May 3-7 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.9 per centage points. Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet & American Life Project, says that new communications channels - from the telephone to radio, TV and personal computers - often breed a cadre of holdouts in their early days. 'It's disorienting because people have different relationships with others depending on the media they use,' Rainie says. 'But we've been through this before. As each new communications media comes to prominence, there is a period of adoption.' Len Kleinrock, 77, says Facebook is fine for his grandchildren, but it's not for him. 'I do not want more distractions,' he says. 'As it is, I am deluged with email. My friends and colleagues have ready access to me and I don't really want another service that I would feel obliged to check into on a frequent basis.' Kleinrock says his resistance is generational, but discomfort with technology isn't a factor. After all, Kleinrock is arguably the world's first Internet user. The University of California, Los Angeles professor was part of the team that invented the Internet. His lab was where researchers gathered in 1969 to send test data between two bulky computers -the beginnings of the Arpanet network, which morphed into the Internet we know today. 'I'm having a `been-there, done-that' feeling,' Mr Kleinrock says. 'There's not a need on my part for reaching out and finding new social groups to interact with. I have trouble keeping up with those I'm involved with now.'Thomas Chin, 35, who works at an advertising and media planning company in New York, says he may be missing out on what friends-of-friends-of-friends are doing, but he doesn't need Facebook to connect with family and closer acquaintances. Connected: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg created the social network from his dorm room at Harvard University eight years ago . Anticipation: Tomorrow, Nasdaq will offer Facebook stocks at an estimated $36 a share, and is one of the most hotly anticipated IPOs in years . 'If we're going to go out to do stuff, we organize it (outside) of Facebook,' he says. Steve Jones, a professor who studies online culture and communications at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says many resisters consider Facebook to be too much of a chore. Who gets rich from Facebook’s expected IPO? Assuming a mid-point price of $36 , following are details on the amount the selling stockholders will make: . 'We've added social networking to our lives. We haven't added any hours to our days,' Mr Jones says. 'The decision to be online on Facebook is simultaneously a decision not to be doing something else.' Mr Jones says many people on Facebook try to overcome that by multitasking, but they end up splitting their attention and engaging with others online only superficially. Arwood, 47, a restaurant manager in Chicago, says she was surprised when colleagues on an English-teaching program in rural Spain in 2010 opted to spend their breaks checking Facebook. 'I spent my time on break trying to learn more about the Spanish culture, really taking advantage of it,' she says. 'I went on walks with some of the students and asked them questions.' Kariann Goldschmitt, 32, a music professor at New College of Florida in Sarasota, Florida, was on Facebook not long after its founding in 2004, but she quit in 2010. In part, it was because of growing concerns about her privacy and Facebook's ongoing encouragement of people to share more about themselves with the company, with marketers and with the world. She says she's been much more productive since leaving. 'I was a typical user, on it once or twice a day,' she says. 'After a certain point, I sort of resented how it felt like an obligation rather than fun.' Besides Facebook resisters and quitters, there are those who take a break. In some cases, people quit temporarily as they apply for new jobs, so that potential employers won't stumble on photos of their wild nights out drinking. Although Facebook doesn't make it easy to find, it offers options for both deleting and suspending accounts. Goldschmitt says it takes effort to stay in touch with friends and relatives without Facebook. For instance, she has to make mental notes of when her friends are expecting babies, knowing that they have become so used to Facebook 'that they don't engage with us anymore.' 'I'm like, `Hmmm, when is nine months?' I have to remember to contact them since they won't remember to tell me when the baby's born.' Neil Robinson, 54, a government lawyer in Washington, says that when his nephew's son was born, pictures went up on Facebook almost immediately. As a Facebook holdout, he had to wait for someone to email photos. After years of resisting, Robinson plans to join next month, mostly because he doesn't want to lose touch with younger relatives who choose Facebook as their primary means of communication. But for every Robinson, there is an Edelstein, who has no desire for Facebook and prefers email and postcards. 'I prefer to keep my communications personal and targeted,' says Jake Edelstein, 41, a pharmaceutical consultant in New York. 'You're getting a message that's written for you. 'Clearly someone took the time to sit down to do it.'","Two out of every five American adults have not joined Facebook, according to recent poll .

Hate preacher Abu Qatada arrived at his new home reportedly near Wembley Stadium in London and telephoned his parents in Jordan at 6am yesterday to boast of his ‘elation’ at being out of jail. The ‘truly dangerous’ fanatic had . been released from Long Lartin high security prison yesterday under . cover of darkness to live near the terror target. Qatada expressed his joy on another day . of high-stakes wrangling and political rows over the best way of . deporting the Al Qaeda-linked preacher back to Jordan. Abu Qatada arriving at his new home surrounded by police and escorted to his front door after he was released on bail . Abu Qatada is reportedly living near Wembley Stadium, in north west London . Delight: Abu Qatada's mother Aisha Othman offers refreshments to Mail staff as a thank you for her son being released . Qatada expressed his joy on another day . of high-stakes wrangling and political rows over the best way of . deporting the Al Qaeda-linked preacher back to Jordan. Last night officials were hopeful they were moving closer to a deal that may prove acceptable to the European Court of Human Rights, which is stubbornly blocking his removal. Qatada - whose new home is reportedly near Wembley Stadium, a prime terror target - called his family home in a poor area of Amman to tell relatives of his delight at being with his wife and five children again. He has spent the past decade in and out of British jails. His mother, Aisha Othman, said: ‘He telephoned to say how happy he was to be out of prison. ‘He was elated to be with his wife and his children again. He was just so pleased. It was wonderful.’ Mrs Othman, who told the Mail that Qatada should be sent back to Jordan, beamed as she said: ‘Thank you, thank you to Britain for at least setting my son free. I want him to be allowed home, of course, but this is very good news.’ Under the terms of his bail, Qatada must observe a 22-hour curfew, and is banned from talking to a list of 27 named fanatics. He is also barred from having a mobile phone, internet access or using any landline phone which is not inside his home address. While Qatada enjoyed his first full day of freedom at his London home, a Home Office delegation led by security minister James Brokenshire was in Jordan trying to negotiate the fanatic’s deportation. ECHR judges in Strasbourg ruled he could not be sent for trial in Jordan if there was a risk that some of the evidence against him might have been obtained by torture. Freed on bail: Abu Qatada is driven out of Long Lartin Prison under the cover of darkness . Ramshackle: This is the property where Abu Qatada's family live in Jordan . In a potential breakthrough, Jordan’s legislative affairs minister, Ayman Odeh, promised that Qatada will receive a fair trial with full rights. He said that while Jordan considered Strasbourg’s attack on its legal system to be unfair, an amendment had now been passed to outlaw the use of evidence obtained through torture, or the threat of it, in trials. Even if this is acceptable to Strasbourg, Qatada could immediately lodge his own appeal against removal, delaying it by yet more months while the public continues to foot his £10,000-a-week security bill. Pressure has been building on ministers simply to put Qatada on a plane in defiance of Strasbourg. Other countries which have ignored the court, such as Italy and France, have received only a fine or letter of warning. Tory former minister David Mellor said: ‘The ruling in Strasbourg is a gnat-bite that the British Government is totally free in law to ignore.’ Last night friends of Qatada speculated that Britain could try to return him to Jordan within the next week. In Amman, Marwan Shehada, a friend of the preacher’s family, said Qatada had asked the British government to request a guarantee from . the King of Jordan that he would be given a fair trial. Mr Shehada said he thought Qatada would be happy to return to Jordan if the right guarantees could be secured. ● Qatada is a Manchester United supporter, his family have revealed. As a youngster he was a keen footballer who played for his school. It is not known if Qatada has visited Old Trafford during his 19 years in Britain.

Gu Kilai, the wife of the former Communist party boss of Chongqing, is said to have told Wang Lijun she was in the hotel room during the ‘gruesome’ poisoning, according to American diplomats. Mr Wang, who ran the city’s police force fled there in February, apparently in fear of his life, to the U.S. consulate in nearby Chengdu.

November and forced to drink cyanide. Afterwards, Mrs Gu – the wife of . former rising star Bo Xilai, who has been has been stripped of all his . roles within the party - allegedly confessed to the crime. ‘Gu said ”I did it” three times to Wang,’ a diplomatic source told The Daily Telegraph. ‘It was a gruesome scene.

The latest claims about Mrs Gu came as . the couple’s son publicly commented for the first time since his mother . was named as prime suspect in the case. Bo Guagua, who is studying at Harvard . after graduating from Oxford, denied rumours about his perceived playboy . lifestyle but declined to comment on the probe.

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 09:54 EST, 28 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:12 EST, 28 February 2013 . A New Jersey inmate on a staggering year-long hunger strike has refused all solid food since March 2012 and lost almost half his body weight as a result claiming 'After a while, you're not hungry anymore.' William Lecuyer, 34, began his protest after his sentence was extended over what he says was a misunderstanding over a drugs test and now has left him on the brink of death. Surviving only on his daily coffee and cream and a nutritional drink once a week, Lecuyer weighed 230 pounds at the start of his strike but now is a skeletal 120 pounds. William Lecuyer in 2000 (left) when he was aged 22 and imprisoned for a series of bank robberies in New Jersey and in 2013 (right) after almost a year of hunger strike . Five months into his abstinence, New Jersey State Prison officials in Trenton were so fearful Lecuyer would die they went to court to get an order to force-feed him and end his hunger strike. 'If medical staff cannot immediately perform these measures over his objections,' the state argued unsuccessfully on July 10 reported NJ.Com, 'he will suffer irreversible organ damage sometime in the next few days and eventually die.' The courts sided with Lecuyer, saying he had a First Amendment right to refuse to eat and eight-months on Lecuyer clings to life. The Attorney General's Office in New Jersey said that no one can ever recall a protest of this length, nor the state attempting to go to court to save the life of an inmate who refused food. William Lecuyer has been held in solitary confinement in New Jersey for the duration of his year-long hunger strike . Lecuyer's lawyer, Jean Ross, said that currently his lips have turned gray, he has significant difficulties concentrating and has developed breathing difficulties because his diaphragm is collapsing. The dispute centers around Lecuyer's desire to see a prison log book he claims will prove he didn't break prison regulations two-years-ago, which led to him receiving a sentence of four-months of solitary confinement. Currently the convicted bank robber has four more years left on his sentence and the state fears if it gives into his request other prisoners will see it as a precedent. 'The prison administration cannot allow itself to be coerced by an inmate,' said Martin Horn, former New York City corrections commissioner and secretary of commissions in Pennsylvania,. 'The point of prison is, when you’ve exhausted your legal options and you don’t get what you want, you have to do what you’re told.' However, according to Lecuyer, 18-months ago a prison drug dog detected something in his cell on June 14th 2011 and he was asked to submit a urine test - something which he and the Department of Corrections both agree on. Lecuyer, claims though, that he was made to wait for more than two hours and had to urinate and when the guard finally requested a sample he was unable to do so. Governor Chris Christie, (left) and Corrections Commissioner Gary Lanigan (right) are involved in negotiations but are unwilling to make an exception in the case of Lecuyer . The former high-school footballer said that the guard agreed to give him more time but later changed his mind and charged Lecuyer with failing to give a sample. Lecuyer says the log book will prove he was made to wait for more than two hours and that no drugs were found in his cell either. 'After a while, you’re not hungry anymore,' Lecuyer said last week in a phone interview with NJ.Com. 'I don’t want to die, but I’m not afraid of it.' His lawyer, Ross, has pleaded with the state including Corrections Commissioner Gary Lanigan and Governor Chris Christie to make an exception. 'They say they would be setting a precedent for other prisoners. But at this point, it wouldn’t be setting any kind of precedent — at this point, it would be saving a life,' said Ross. Lecuyer has spent nearly half his life in and out of prisons and was first arrest for robbing a gas station in 1998 with an unloaded handgun and was sentenced in 2000 for that crime as well as robberies of two other gas stations, a dry cleaner and a laundromat. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison and is scheduled for release in 2017. 'All of them (crimes) involved guns — I knew I was going down,' said Lecuyer. 'I was a junkie.' Admitting he was a drug addict before his entry to prison, Lecuyer is proud to have never failed a drugs test inside prison. 'I’m not trying to get out of anything I’ve done,' said inmate. Since his hunger protest began in July, Lecuyer has refused all solid food. He takes coffee in the morning with milk and sugar and has allowed staff to give him saline or electrolytes intravenously four times. William Lecuyer has been kept alive by consuming nutritional drinks such as Ensure weekly . Since December, he has had one nutritional drink, such as Ensure, at least once a week. However, Ross said the drinks now increase his blood pressure, indicating that his body is shutting down. His mother, Jane Chambers has understandably been pushed to her wits end by her sons stance. 'He’s going to keep fighting the battle — I just hope he’s alive if he wins it,' said Chambers. And Lecuyer himself is pessimistic about the outcome of his hunger strike. 'There ain’t really much plans for the future,' he said.",William Lecuyer is close to death after refusing all food since March 2012 because of a dispute with the State of New Jersey over prison records .
"By . Jack Doyle and Rebecca English . PUBLISHED: . 11:28 EST, 16 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:45 EST, 17 October 2012 . Prince Charles wrote to seven departments in 2004 and 2005 . The government has blocked the release of secret letters Prince of Wales wrote to ministers because they would 'seriously damage' his political neutrality and his role as future king. The letters were requested under the Freedom of Information Act, but yesterday the attorney general stopped the release saying they were 'particularly frank' and . would 'potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality' if published. He added that any suggestion he was 'disagreeing with government policy' would be 'seriously damaging to his role as future monarch'. The High Court had previously ruled that . two dozen ‘black spider’ letters – which Charles sent during . the last Labour government – should be revealed. A judge said it was in the public interest to release the letters, which were described in court as ‘advocacy correspondence’ through which the Prince of Wales had sought to influence government policy. But yesterday the Government’s chief legal officer overturned the ruling. ‘The Prince of Wales is party-political neutral,’ said Dominic Grieve. ‘Moreover, it is highly important that he is not considered by the public to favour one political party or another. ‘This risk will arise if, through these letters, the Prince of Wales was viewed by others as disagreeing with government policy. ‘Any such perception would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch, because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king.’ Critics of the prince said the public had a right to know what he was lobbying ministers on, and attacked the decision for protecting the Royal Family from legitimate public scrutiny. Senior royal sources signalled the prince felt he had done nothing wrong and had a right to advise ministers. In 2009 it emerged that Charles had written letters – known as ‘black spider’ memos because of their scrawled handwriting – on issues such as eco-towns, hospital design and housing. Former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord . Irvine said he had been ‘bombarded’ by the prince about matters . including the Human Rights Act. The subjects of the letters which were . vetoed yesterday remain unknown, but they date from September 2004 to . April 2005. They were requested under the Freedom of Information Act by a journalist from the Guardian newspaper. It requested the chance to see letters between Prince Charles and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department of Health, the Department for Children, Schools and Families (which is now the Department for Education), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Northern Ireland Office and the Cabinet Office . The request was rejected by the seven Government departments where the letters were sent. But last month an Information Tribunal at the High Court ruled that 27 letters qualified as ‘advocacy correspondence’ in which Charles expressed a view on the rights or wrongs of a particular policy. With these letters, the tribunal said, there was a ‘public interest strongly in favour of disclosure’. Mr Justice Walker said the prince was exploiting his privileged access to ministers, adding: ‘Those who seek to influence government policy must understand that the public has a legitimate interest in knowing what they have been doing.’ But yesterday Mr Grieve used the . ministerial veto over Freedom of Information requests to order the . letters be kept from public view. The letters of Prince Charles, pictured during a visit to the Heartlands Community Regeneration Project in Truro, will not be released . He said they reflected Charles’s ‘most deeply held personal views and beliefs’ and were ‘in many cases particularly frank’. It is now unlikely their contents will become known until after the prince’s death. Clarence House refused to comment. But senior royal sources insisted it was the prince’s ‘absolute right, even duty’ to correspond with ministers over ‘issues of national importance’. The Campaign for Freedom of Information criticised the decision. Its director Maurice Frankel said: ‘The tribunal concluded that the Prince’s lobbying on behalf of various charitable causes did not fall under the constitutional convention designed to educate the heir to the throne to become monarch. He is trying to change government policy, not learn about it.’ Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said: ‘It’s an open secret that Prince Charles lobbies the Government. What the public has a right to know is what he is lobbying for.’ The Guardian last night announced a High Court challenge to the veto – on the grounds the Government had acted unreasonably. But legal experts say the challenge is unlikely to succeed.","The High Court previously ruled that 27 of 30 letters should be revealed .

Culture Secretary Maria Miller claimed a 'climbdown' by Mr Miliband had brought the parties closer to launching a powerful newspaper watchdog which would implement fines of up to £1million . Talks on a new Press regulation system were on a knife-edge last night as David Cameron tried to head off a damaging Commons defeat. The three party leaders were inching towards a deal on a Royal Charter to enshrine a powerful newspaper watchdog which would implement fines of up to £1million. Tory sources claimed that Labour and the Liberal Democrats – who joined forces to try to force through laws shackling the 300-year-old free Press – had offered key concessions. Culture Secretary Maria Miller claimed a ‘climbdown’ by Mr Miliband had brought the Opposition ‘much closer to our position’. But Downing Street also appeared ready to give ground in an attempt to head off what looked like inevitable defeat in Parliament tonight. Cross-party talks on how to take forward the recommendations of Lord Justice  Leveson’s report on media standards collapsed last week when the Prime Minister lost patience with fresh Labour demands. Yesterday, however, it emerged that Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg had met face to face and reopened negotiations ahead of a crunch Commons vote due tonight. Tory whips have warned the Prime Minister he is likely to face defeat thanks to combined Labour and Lib Dem votes if he presses ahead with his version of a Royal Charter. Around 20 Tories are thought to be ready to back the Lib/Lab pact. Mr Cameron last night appeared ready to contemplate a single clause in legislation to ensure that the Royal Charter could not be amended in the future without two-thirds majorities in both Houses of Parliament and the agreement of all three party leaders. Differences between the parties remained over key details of the new rules governing the Press, including the prominence of apologies required by a new regulator and the right of the industry to object to who sits on it. Chancellor George Osborne said he hoped a last-minute deal could be found, warning that a regulatory system without cross-party support was unlikely to last. ‘There is still an opportunity for us to get together and get a Press law that works,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘Ultimately we are not about grandstanding on this; we are about getting a law that works.’ Mrs Miller added: ‘Labour has been trying to push through a tough form of statutory regulation for the Press with really unacceptable consequences for freedom of speech in this country. ‘I think their climbdown from that position has put them much closer to our position, and that is to be welcomed.’ Labour said it had not been approached over any new cross-party talks. A senior source said: ‘We are in lock-step with the Lib Dems on this. Any agreement must be on the basis of our Royal Charter. We are planning to go ahead with the votes in the Commons.’ Mr Miliband urged MPs to ‘stand up for the victims’ of Press intrusion by enshrining a new regulator in law. His deputy Harriet Harman, the party’s media spokesman, suggested it wanted the Press to be prevented from writing about private lives. ‘There are a lot of things that can turn people’s lives upside down that are not criminal offences and that’s what we need to ensure that we protect people from,’ she told the BBC’s Sunday Politics. Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord Hunt said publishers were ready to sign up to a tough new ‘Leveson-compliant’ watchdog but believed statutory underpinning would send a dangerous signal to the world about Press freedom. He said publishers ‘have all agreed to have a new body and a fresh start – with teeth’. What was proposed was ‘probably the strongest regulatory body in Europe: ability to fine; ability to carry out investigations’. ‘They have all signed up to that and they just say “we don’t need statute; the last thing we should do is send a message across the world that the UK now has a Press law.’ The pressure group pushing for statutory Press regulation plotted to exploit the parents of murdered Milly Dowler to achieve its political aims, a leaked briefing note revealed yesterday. A ‘strategy document’ drawn up by Hacked Off set out plans to draw up a ‘Dowler test’ that it could use to force David Cameron into shackling newspapers. It said that Hacked Off itself would make up the Dowler test, and ‘the Dowler family must support that definition’. Both Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have repeatedly referred to the Dowlers in their recent public statements on Press regulation. The exploitation of Bob and Sally Dowler – described as ‘hypocrisy and cynicism’ by senior Tory MP David Davis – is outlined in the leaked memo produced for leaders of Hacked Off in September. A family torn apart: Murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, 13, with her mother Sally . The document said that Hacked Off has just one aim, to establish ‘an independent statutory regulator with punitive powers’. To achieve this, the organisation intended to invent a ‘Dowler test’. The memo said: ‘The expression the Dowler test has pushed its way into the popular political lexicon, when in fact it doesn’t exist. Not yet that is. We need to define what the Dowler test actually is.’ It referred to the Prime Minister’s evidence to Lord Justice Leveson last June in which Mr Cameron said that the present Press self-regulation system had failed families such as the Dowlers and the parents of missing Madeleine McCann and that was ‘the test’. The PM also said the present Press self-regulation system had failed families such as the Dowlers and the parents of missing Madeleine McCann . The Hacked Off document said: ‘He (Cameron) would favour a robust form of self-regulation as long as it passed the Dowler test. We can use these words against him. Defining the Dowler test is key. The Prime Minister cannot go back on it. The opposition must not be allowed to define it, we must.’ The memo then says that Milly Dowler’s parents must be seen to back the Hacked Off test. ‘The Dowler family must support that definition; it is in their name that we act.’ The document, drawn up by Hacked Off head of campaigns Ella Mason, was presented to a meeting at the London headquarters of law firm Mishcon de Reya on 19 September last year. The meeting was held in the office of Charlotte Harris, a lawyer representing a number of phone hacking victims, and was attended by the group’s founder Brian Cathcart and Hugh Grant, one of its directors. It also advocated approaching disillusioned Right-wing Tory MPs to undermine Mr Cameron on his own back benches. The memo indicates that Hacked Off and its leaders regard such MPs with distaste. It added that Hacked Off would say different things to different people depending on what it thought they were most likely to want to hear. ‘Our messages will differ depending on whether these groups are left or right-leaning.’ Hacked Off confirmed yesterday that the document, leaked to the Mail on Sunday by a whistleblower said to be disenchanted with the group’s message, was genuine.","Tory sources claim Labour and Lib Dems  had offered 'key concessions'

"By . Gavin Madeley . UPDATED: . 03:20 EST, 22 November 2011 . Former Olympic star Liz McColgan last night launched a furious broadside against her ‘controlling’ husband as she was cleared of assaulting him during their bitter separation. The one-time world 10,000m champion was close to tears as she described enduring a ‘tough life’ with Peter McColgan, claiming he had subjected her to years of misery. Her emotional outburst followed an extraordinary trial yesterday in which a court heard allegations that her jealous husband had spied on her email conversations after he suspected that she was conducting an affair. Cleared: Former athlete Liz McColgan was acquitted of assaulting her husband Peter (right) today . Mr McColgan, a former international . steeplechaser, even sent anonymous texts to his wife, her supposed lover . and the other man’s wife threatening to expose the alleged affair if it . did not stop. He told Arbroath Sheriff Court that the estranged couple’s relationship . broke down irrevocably after Mrs McColgan launched an attack on him in . July in the family home in front of their terrified children before . throwing his clothes out of an upstairs window. However, a sheriff acquitted Mrs McColgan, 47, of assault after her . lawyer painted a picture of her husband as a ‘shifty, conniving’ man . whose evidence was neither reliable nor credible. Happier times: The McColgans with their daughter Eilish, who is now a successful young athlete herself . Speaking after the case, the Commonwealth gold medal winner said: . ‘This has been a really hard six months for my family, and I want to . thank particularly my family and [defence lawyer] George Donnelly. ‘There’s a lot more to this story. I have had a very tough life with . Peter McColgan. It has not been easy and nobody knows the true story. I . am on the way to a new life now and totally free from someone who has . tried to control everything that I’ve done. I’m so glad that the sheriff . saw sense today.’ She lambasted her husband for ‘hiding behind an assault charge when . there are men out there who are actually sitting in that position with . women that are beating them up’. She added: ‘I think it’s so cruel of him to use such a lame excuse and . to try and ruin me by pretending that there was an incident that . happened in my house. My only regret is that my children will be . affected by this. I’m a good mother on my way to a new life.’ Champion: Mrs McColgan won an Olympic silver and Commonwealth and World Championship golds . The court heard earlier that Mr McColgan, 48, called in police following . a row at the couple’s home in Angus in Scotland on July 12. He said he suspected his wife, whom he married in 1987, of having an . affair and he had consulted solicitors. On the morning in question, he . said, she launched a tirade against him while their children, then aged . six, nine, ten and 11, watched in horror. He said: ‘She started just shouting about a solicitor’s letter that she . had received and asking why had I done this and why was I selling the . house. But before she had left she had said, “Stop fannying about – go . and get a solicitor because it’s not going to work out”. ‘She started prodding me in the stomach and the next thing I remember . was two punches to the side of my face.’ He claimed she then threw all . his clothes out of their bedroom window. A charge relating to that . alleged incident was dropped. Popular: In 1991, she was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year . Earlier, Mr Donnelly asked Mr McColgan why he had used computer ‘spyware’ to secretly check on his wife’s email conversations. He told the court: ‘I used it because I thought she was having an . affair. I used it once and when I did my suspicions were verified when I . saw a conversation on Facebook in February 2010.’ Regarding the anonymous texts,  Mr Donnelly said: ‘Do you remember . buying a mobile phone and SIM card in London and sending texts to your . wife, the third party and the third party’s wife saying that you would . disclose a so-called relationship to the Press?’ Mr McColgan replied: ‘No. I was trying to bring the affair to an end. I . sent texts saying when is this going to end. There were no threats.’ Mrs McColgan won Commonwealth gold in 1986 and 1990 and Olympic silver . in 1988. She also won gold at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo.","Peter McColgan's testimony not considered reliable .

There is a secret and steadily growing number of Britons that live as prisoners in their own home. They are so obese they cannot leave their house, and in some cases, even their own bedroom. Now the subject of a new Channel 5 series, Big Body Squad follows the lives of those who are so large they cannot carry out everyday tasks, as well as the expert help they draft in. Scroll down for video . Trapped: Denise Ecclestone requires constant care so husband Eddie (pictured) has drafted in expert help . Denise's husband Eddie gets well needed respite from his caring role when Linda and Andrea (pictured) visit each day . For the first time in history, obesity is killing more people than malnutrition. Around 15 million Britons are obese and it is estimated that this will cost the UK a staggering £27 billion by 2016. There are currently 800 purpose-built . big body ambulances in the UK and the number is steadily rising, . costing the UK taxpayer millions each year. Other . services touched on in the show include specialist shoe-makers who are . now catering to the those with fat ankles and feet as well as companies . who are using military science to develop extra strong harnesses and . hoists to mobilise those who cannot move themselves. At 40 stone, Denise Ecclestone, 50, who lives in Tamworth in the West Midlands hasn't left her house for seven years and has been confined to one room for the past 12 months. She requires a constant supply of oxygen because of the pressure the excess weight places on her body. 'The weight went on when I damaged my spine and it started to crumble,' says the former nurse and mother of three. 'I became very depressed when I felt that everything was being taken away.' Luckily however, Denise's husband Eddie has fought for her to have specialist care and now, instead of receiving staff chosen by the local council, she receives £1,300 a month to pay for carers she interviewed and chose herself. Teenager Callum is waging war on his waistline at a specialist residential camp int he North of England . Working out: Callum is put through his paces as he endeavors to reduce his 35 stone weight . Each day two female carers, Linda and . Andrea, visit Denise to give her a full body wash to prevent infections . developing which could could further compromise her health. It is also a . break for Eddie, who admits that caring for his wife is stressful at . times. Later in the programme, viewers meet 17-year-old Callum, who at 35 stone has embarked on a residential course open to NHS and private patients. Run by weight management consultant Professor Paul Gately, the course aims to change attitudes towards food and exercise. Callum's aim is to lose 20 kilos by the end of his stay. He gained weight when his grandmother died just before he started secondary school. His increasing waist size became the butt of bullies' cruel jokes and so a vicious circle of overeating began. Around a third of British children are now obese and roughly 300 British children are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes each year, a disease once only associated with middle-aged adults. Carol Davies is so overweight she cannot get to the hospital without specially-trained paramedics equipped to deal with obese patients . Big business: Steve Burton (centre, back) and his team work to get overweight people where they need to be . Viewers also meet Carol Davies, 52, who has not left her second-floor flat for a year since she hit 20 stone. Previously very active - enjoying swimming and walking - she quickly gained the weight after tearing a ligament in her foot. She too relies on her husband Steve for everyday care, but needs to visit hospital for a check-up and he is unable to carry her down to the ground floor. Thankfully, specially-trained ambulance worker Steve Burton and his team are drafted in and use their cutting-edge equipment to manoeuvre Carol down the narrow flights of stairs to an ambulance that has been designed to transport even the most obese patients.

He achieved notoriety as a 10-year-old when he became the youngest person in Britain to be served an Asbo. But any hope the sanction had helped Robert Heneghan turn his life around were badly misplaced. The 19-year-old, once labelled the Imp of Satan, was last night starting a life sentence for murder after stabbing a teenager to death at a birthday party. Waste of life: Robert Heneghan pictured left shortly after his arrest for murder when he was 19 and right as a 10-year-old when he became the youngest person in Britain to receive an Asbo . Sam Bee was stabbed to death after he intervened as a peacekeeper during a row at his sister's birthday party . Sam Bee, also 19, a factory worker, . had tried to act as peacemaker and calm Heneghan when he became involved . in a fight with another youth. But Heneghan turned on the teenager . and, with an ‘evil smirk’ on his face, plunged a knife into his chest . causing fatal injuries. Mr Bee staggered away from the house . unaware of the seriousness of his injury and collapsed and died in a . back yard of a nearby hotel. His terminally ill mother Sue Thompson died just days later without being told her son had been stabbed to death. Heneghan, who pleaded not guilty to murder, was convicted by a jury following a trial at  Preston Crown Court. Mr Justice Andrew Leggatt told him: . ‘Sam Bee had done you no harm. He hadn’t threatened or attacked you, he . did nothing to provoke you. He made light of the fact that you had got . into a fight with your friend. ‘You were angry with him for that . because your pride had been hurt. Under the influence of drink, you have . proved yourself to be a serious danger to the public.’ Sam Bee was found in an alleyway between Dean Street and Station Road in Blackpool in August last year . It emerged Heneghan had been sentenced . to youth custody in 2009 when he was 16 after he knifed a man in the . chest. That victim survived. His criminal career started before his 10th birthday when he began terrorising his local housing estate in Bispham, Blackpool. He was arrested up to three times a . week for a variety of offences including threatening two women at a . tanning salon with a ball-bearing gun. With an accomplice, he stripped a . nine-year-old boy and forced him to run home naked. In other incidents a . charity shop was set on fire, children were threatened with a knife, . and a faeces-covered football was tossed into a supermarket. At a court case in Blackpool in 2004, . police attributed 43 anti-social incidents over a six-month period to . Heneghan and an 11-year-old friend. After the case, one resident said: . ‘It may sound like something out of the Dark Ages, but I would describe . those two as imps of Satan. They have made our lives an absolute . misery.’ Victim: Sam Bee, 19, was knifed to death at his sister's birthday party by Heneghan as he stood in the kitchen . Eventually both were served with . seven-year Asbos after a court heard how they burgled houses, stole . jewellery, threw water bombs and paint at people, cars and property. Heneghan’s life of crime came to a . tragic climax last August after Sam Bee went to a party thrown by his . sister to celebrate her boyfriend’s birthday. Heneghan got into a fight and received . a cut above his eye but Mr Bee stepped in as a peacemaker. His sister . Sarah, 21, told the court: ‘Heneghan sort of looked at Sam with a bit of . a smirk on his face. He calmly walked into the kitchen and he just . stabbed him. Sam was just stood there doing nothing.’ Fatal: The alleyway where Sam Bee collapsed and died after fleeing the house party . She bundled her brother out of the . door to protect him, not realising  he was badly injured. By the time . news filtered through he had died, Heneghan was at another house. He . told a friend: ‘I should have punched him instead.’ Heneghan  told the court there was . only a bit of blood on the knife and he thought it had just grazed the . teenager. He said: ‘I ended up picking up this thing and swinging out . with my arm. It was a knife. I felt it hit him but I didn’t know where . or how deep.’ Outside court Detective Superintendent Paul Withers said: . ‘This case highlights the most serious consequences of carrying a knife.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 03:49 EST, 22 September 2011 . A video could prove crucial in finding out who dumped 35 corpses near a shopping mall in a Mexican Gulf coast city during rush hour - and why. Police are still trying to determine who was responsible for the gruesome incident, in which suspected drug traffickers drove two trucks to a main avenue and dumped the dead bodies while gunmen stood guard and pointed their weapons at terrified motorists. It is feared the incident, which happened in downtown Boco del Rio earlier this week, is the latest escalation in drug violence in the Veracruz state - an area which sits on an important route for drugs and Central American migrants heading north. Drugs battles: A police motorcyclist stands guard over two trucks piled with bodies which were dumped on the underpass in Boca del Rio while gunmen pointed their weapons at terrified motorists . Drugs war: Police have identified most of the victims and all had records for murder, drug dealing, kidnapping and extortion and were linked to organised crime . Gruesome task: Police and Mexican army soldiers take away the 35 bodies which were dumped near Boca del Rio's biggest shopping mall. Some reports said 12 women were among the dead . Footage is being examined in the hope . of finding out how the men managed to drive two open-back trucks, . filled with corpses, through rush-hour traffic before dumping them in . front of shocked onlookers. Reynaldo Escobar Perez, Veracruz's . Attorney General, said in a radio interview yesterday that the video may . reveal the trucks being guarded by other cars, which could have doubled . as getaway vehicles. Escobar Perez also said they were looking into whether police colluded with the people who dumped the bodies. He confirmed that by yesterday . morning (Wednesday) most of the bodies had been identified through . police databases; most of them had criminal records and one of them had . been identified as a local policeman who disappeared 15 days ago. Busted: Alleged member of Mexico's Caballeros Templarios drug cartel, Saul Solis Solis (centre), and two of his accomplices are held after a separate incident . The bodies and abandoned trucks were . found by police close to a shopping mall on Tuesday, September 20. The . corpses has spilled out of the vehicle and into the road. The shirt-less . bodies, piled on top of each other, were clearly visible from people . crossing a nearby overpass. Mexico's state prosecutors and court officials were due to meet in Boco del Rio today. Jose Reveles, a security analyst, . told CNN: 'This is a way of making yourself known, and saying, ""We have . the power, we can do this with impunity"". 'We do it at five in the evening, in a heavily travelled avenue. We drive two trucks loaded with cadavers, and nobody stops us.' Veracruz has seen an increase in . drug-related violence as a turf war escalates. The Zetas drug cartel has . been locked in a bloody war with drug gangs for control of the state. Mexico President: Felipe Calderon's nation has serious drug problems . The dead include 23 men and 12 women, with witnesses saying the bodies were dumped 'like trash in the street'. Describing the grisly discovery as . 'unprecedented', Escobar Perez said in a separate interview that the . victims could have died from suffocation, with only one being found with . a bullet wound. He also said that none of the bodies . identified had been connected to three prison breaks in Veracruz on . Tuesday, which saw 32 inmates escape. Motorists caught in the horrifying . scene posted message on Twitter warning that masked gunmen in military . uniforms were blocking Manuel Avila Camacho Boulevard and pointing their . guns at civilians. 'They don't seem to be soldiers or police,' one tweet read. Another said: 'Don't go through that area, there is danger.' Earlier this week, the Mexican army announced it had captured a key figure in . the cult-like Knights Templar drug cartel that is sowing violence in . western Mexico. Saul Solis Solis, 49, a former police chief and one-time congressional candidate, was captured without incident on Monday in the cartel's home state of Michoacan, Brigadier General Edgar Luis Villegas said during a presentation of Solis to the media. Solis is considered to be one of the principal lieutenants in the Knights Templar, which split late last year from La Familia, a pseudo-religious drug gang known as a major trafficker of methamphetamine. Drug violence has claimed more than 35,000 lives across Mexico since 2006, according to government figures. Others put the number at more than 40,000. In northern Mexico, the army announced the detention of two more suspects in a casino fire that killed 52 people last month in the northern city of Monterrey. The two men captured at a bar in Monterrey late on Monday confessed to being members of the Zetas drug cartel and participating in the attack, federal prosecutors said. Separately in Nuevo Leon, Mexican marines captured 19 alleged members of the Zetas drug cartel at a ranch that was being used as a training camp in the town of Colombia, the military announced. A navy statement said that seven minors were among those detained and that marines seized four rifles, a pistol, and several military uniforms and boots.","Footage could reveal trucks being guarded by other vehicles .

She also tweeted: 'The sun is shining at Cheltenham and how GREAT does Pippa Middleton look in her Katherine Hooker Tori coat?' And if that wasn't enough to guarantee plenty of photographs, the coat itself was in a particularly bright shade of yellow.

He denied Mr Cruddas's claims that big donors' concerns were fed into . a policy committee at Downing Street, and insisted that none of those . who dined with him had been recommended by the former treasurer - who . quit his post on Saturday, hours after the Sunday Times revealed his . comments. 'None of these dinners were fundraising dinners and none of these . dinners were paid for by the taxpayer. I have known most of those . attending for many years,' said the PM. Invited: David Rowland in an early picture and right, Telegraph Media Group chief executive . Murdoch MacLennan, who is not listed by the Electoral Commission as a . donor to the Tories . He announced that eminent lawyer and Tory peer Lord Gold would conduct a . party inquiry into the affair. But Labour leader Ed Miliband dismissed the Gold inquiry as 'a . whitewash' and called for an independent probe by the PM's official . adviser on ministerial interests Sir Alex Allan. Billionaire city boss Michael Spencer went for dinner at Number 10 in February . 'This scandal speaks to the conduct and character of this Prime Minister and his Government,' said Mr Miliband. 'Anything short of an independent inquiry will leave a permanent stain . on the reputation of this Government and this Prime Minister.' The 12 dinner-party guests at Downing Street had between them given . almost £18 million to the Conservatives since Mr Cameron became leader, . he said. And in a clear reference to last week's announcement of a cut from 50p . to 45p in the top rate of income tax on earnings over £150,000, he . added: 'I bet they did alright out of last week's Budget.' Mr Miliband accused the PM of showing 'utter contempt' for the Commons . by failing to attend the House to address MPs about the affair, instead . sending Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude. Mr Maude was almost drowned out by Labour shouts of 'Where's Cameron?' as he delivered a statement to MPs just hours after he had dismissed the . Cruddas allegations as 'a bit of a nonsense' in a radio interview. He accused Labour of a 'shameful' role in the party funding saga, . telling MPs that union barons who bankroll the party were able not only . to influence policy but also to choose the leader. Declaring that he will lead the Tory team in revived cross-party talks . on party funding, Mr Maude said that Conservatives were ready to accept a . cap on donations, but only if it applied not only to individuals and . companies but to unions too - something Labour has resisted. Dinner date: Sir Anthony Bamford of JCB and right, Lord Sainsbury who attended dinner at Downing Street on July 14 2010 . The Conservative Party said that Mr Cameron hosted a post-election . 'thank-you' dinner at 10 Downing Street on July 14 2010 attended by a . number of 'significant' donors who had given the Tories at least £50,000 . each. 'Business deals': Mr Cruddas was secretly filmed telling undercover reporters he could arrange private meetings with senior Conservatives . They included JCB chairman Sir Anthony Bamford, who has personally . donated £70,000 since Mr Cameron became leader while his company has . given almost £1.7 million; financier Michael Farmer, who has given . around £2.5 million; hedge fund tycoon Michael Hintze, who gave more . than £1.2 million; Tory peer Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, who . gave £1 million; property developer Michael Freeman, who gave £380,000; . and hedge fund chief executive Sir Paul Ruddock, who gave £520,000. On February 28 last year, property tycoon and donor of more than £4 . million David Rowland attended a dinner in the flat, along with party . co-chairman Lord Feldman. On November 2 2011, Mr Cameron held a 'social dinner for strong and . long-term supporters of the party, with whom the PM has a strong . relationship', including Mr Farmer, the banker and Tory donor Henry . Angest and oil company boss Ian Taylor. And on February 27 this year, he held a social dinner with former . treasurer and major donor Michael Spencer, who gave more than £3 million . through his company IPGL and £200,000 personally. Mr Rowland and his wife had lunch at Chequers on August 8 2010, while . businessman Fares Fares, who has donated almost £60,000 to the Tories, . had lunch in the Buckinghamshire country house on November 7 that year.

Straw said that today's announcement was 'symptomatic of the pandemonium . that has broken out in the Conservative Party and in the higher reaches . of the Government.' He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: 'I think that . we will still need an independent inquiry.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick . Clegg also released a list of major Liberal Democrat donors who had lunch or . dinners at his official residence Chevening today. The party released four dates in April . and June last year where he entertained former Lib Dem party treasurer Richard Duncalf and his . partner, entrepreneur Rumi Verjee, co-founder of Ministry of Sound James Palumbo and Sudhi and Anita Choudrie. A party spokesman said: 'These were . not paid for by the taxpayer. This list is based on party records and . diaries and is complete to the best of our knowledge.' The Prime Minister renewed calls for . Labour to agree on a cap of £50,000 on donations to parties, but . insisted that this limit must apply not only to individuals and . companies but also to unions - something Labour has always resisted. News Corporation chairman Rupert . Murdoch, whose own meetings with politicians have come under intense . scrutiny as a result of the News of the World hacking scandal, called . for an independent inquiry into the 'cash for access' affair. Writing on Twitter today, Mr Murdoch . said: 'Of course there must be a full independent inquiry on both sides. 'In great detail, and with consequences. Trust must be established. Without trust, democracy, and order will go.' Sir Christopher Kelly, chairman of the . Committee on Standards in Public Life, last night warned that the . revelations were ‘not an isolated incident’. He . added: ‘As long as we have a system in which the main political parties . are reliant on very large donations from very rich individuals – or . organisations, in the case of the Labour Party – then events of this . kind are almost bound to happen. ‘It . is a cancer which needs to be addressed.’ The . revelations are deeply embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who pledged two . years ago to crack down on the shadowy world of lobbying. The . existence of secret dinners with donors also undermines the Coalition’s . much-vaunted transparency drive, which allows the public to see who . ministers have met in their official capacity. Downing Street insisted that the Government had been 'more transparent' than any previous administration. Asked about the actions of Mr Cruddas, the spokeswoman said: 'We are just as flabbergasted as you guys.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:52 EST, 14 October 2011 . Raj Rajaratnam, a self-made hedge fund tycoon convicted in the biggest Wall Street trading scandal in a generation, was ordered to serve 11 years in prison, the longest sentence ever in an insider-trading case but far less than prosecutors sought. Today sentencing caps a prosecution, marked by secret wiretaps of Rajaratnam and his associates, that shocked the investment world. The Sri Lanka-born fund manager once stood atop a $7billion New York hedge fund, but was found guilty of running a network of informants who supplied him with corporate secrets. Defeated: Raj Rajaratnam, co-founder of Galleon Group LLC, leaves Federal Court with his attorney Terence Lynam, after his sentencing on Thursday in New York . The sentence was lighter than the . 19-and-a-half year minimum term that prosecutors had sought, and was . only slightly more than the 10 years handed down recently to a former . Rajaratnam employee at the now-shuttered Galleon Group hedge fund. The judge, in rejecting calls for a tougher sentence, said Rajaratnam, 54, faces 'imminent kidney failure' due to advanced diabetes. He referred to a report from the defence describing Rajaratnam's doctors as recommending dialysis soon. The report said the doctors had begun the process for obtaining a kidney transplant. 'Prison creates a more intense form of punishment for critically ill prisoners,' U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell said. He added, however, that illness does not provide 'a get-out-of-jail-free card'. The judge also cited the multimillionaire's charitable work including helping victims of natural disasters in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and in the United States. Rajaratnam, standing with his lawyers and looking straight ahead, was expressionless after hearing the sentence. Before the judge announced his ruling, Rajaratnam said 'No thank you, Your Honor,' when asked if he wanted to make a statement. Rajaratnam's lawyers, whose client showed no obvious signs of poor health during the 80-minute hearing on Thursday, have said that a long prison term would amount to a death sentence. Media storm: Camera crews follow the Sri Lanka-born fund manager, who once stood atop a $7billion New York hedge fund, outside of the courtroom on Thursday . The judge granted Rajaratnam's . request to recommend he be sent to a prison in Butner, North Carolina, . best known for housing Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff, who is . serving a life term. The prison, whose inmates range from white-collar . offenders to child molesters and gang members, has a hospital. Rajaratnam was the key figure of a sprawling criminal case, unveiled in October 2009, that touched some of America's top companies, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Intel Corp, IBM and the elite McKinsey & Co consultancy. Prosecutors have placed him in a dubious pantheon of Wall Street power players such as takeover specialist Ivan Boesky and junk bond financier Michael Milken, principal figures in a mid-1980s insider-trading case. Both men served about two years in prison. Rajaratnam's actions were 'brazen, pervasive and egregious,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky said in court on Thursday, urging for the maximum punishment. Holwell also decried Rajaratnam's offenses, saying 'the government is absolutely correct that insider trading is an assault on the free markets that are a fundamental element of our democratic society.' Rajaratnam was ordered to surrender on November 28. The judge rejected his request to remain under house arrest at his luxury Manhattan apartment while he pursues an appeal over the legality of the wiretaps. Expressionless: Rajaratnam is shown in this courtroom sketch during his sentencing. He declined to make a statement before the ruling . Federal inmates typically must serve at least 85 per cent of their terms before being eligible for release. Rajaratnam's wife, Asha, who has never attended court in the two years since his arrest, sat in the third row of the courtroom's public seats while the judge imposed sentence. Rajaratnam was convicted in May on 14 charges of securities fraud and conspiracy. He did not testify in his own defence at his two-month trial, but his voice was heard repeatedly on the 45 recorded phone calls played for the jury. The judge also fined him $10million and ordered him to forfeit $53.8million, which Holwell said approximated the illegal profits and avoided losses from the trading scheme. The Galleon case sent shock waves through Wall Street and the hedge fund industry, where traders can try to get an edge at all costs. Prosecutors say Rajaratnam and others crossed the line by pumping corporate insiders for corporate earnings or details of mergers that had not yet been announced. The investigation featured extensive use of secret FBI phone taps. Such tactics usually are reserved for Mafia and drug trafficking investigations. Guilty: A courtroom drawing shows Raj Rajaratnam (L) with Judge Richard Holwell at Federal Court. Rajaratnam was ordered to surrender on November 28 . In court: Rajaratnam (R) with Judge Richard Holwell (upper C) Defense Attorney William White(L), Assistant US Attorney Reed Brodsky, and Defense Attorney Samidh Gudh (2ndR) today . The case has been a major victory for the Justice Department. Out of 26 people, including traders, lawyers, executives and consultants charged in the case, 25 have pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial of supplying or trading on illicit stock tips. One is at large. 'We can only hope that this case will be the wake-up call we said it should be when Mr Rajaratnam was arrested,' Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. One conspirator caught on the phone taps was Danielle Chiesi, a former high school beauty queen who became a hedge fund trader at New Castle Funds. 'They're gonna guide down,' Chiesi told Rajaratnam on a July 24, 2008 recording of them discussing Akamai Technologies Inc's full-year outlook. 'I just got a call from my guy. I played him like a finely tuned piano.' At the trial, several of Rajaratnam's former friends and associates, including former McKinsey consultant Anil Kumar and former Intel executive Rajiv Goel, testified against him. Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein also testified that disclosure of boardroom talks to Rajaratnam by a Goldman board member went against the bank's confidentiality policies. Insider-trading defendants often get sentences lower than what is prescribed in federal guidelines, out of the view that their crime is less harmful than other types of misdeeds. Judges have handed down some tough insider-trading sentences recently. A former Galleon employee, stock trader Zvi Goffer, 34, was sentenced last month to ten years in prison. In a 2008 case, former Credit Suisse investment banker Hafiz Naseem also was sentenced to ten years. Rajaratnam drew only a slightly longer term. 'I think it's a fair sentence,' said Thomas Dewey, a defence attorney at law firm Dewey Pegno & Kramarsky. The judge 'balanced the seriousness of the crime and the need for deterrence with his medical issues and the good works Raj has done to come out at the right place.' Rajaratnam founded Galleon in 1997 and built it into one of the world's largest hedge funds. Galleon made all of its investors whole when it was wound down after his arrest.","Sri Lanka-born fund manager once stood .

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was ejected from his Boston mosque for aggressive behavior after insulting Martin Luther King Jr. during a Friday prayer service three months ago . The eldest Boston bombing suspect had not one but two rage-filled rants in a New England mosque, it was revealed today. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a police shootout on Thursday night, lashed out at religious leaders at the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center on two occasions, the mosque said in a statement Monday, both of which occurred only after he returned from his six-month trip to Russia. The first outburst came last November when preachers told mosque congregants that it was appropriate for Muslims to celebrate U.S. holidays such as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving, causing Tamerlan to stand up and argue. The second was this past January. The mosque said that Tamerlan, who was not a member but visited for Friday evening services often, lashed out at a preacher for lecturing on Martin Luther King Jr’s accomplishments. According to a release sent out Monday, Tamerlan screamed at the preacher and called him a ‘hypocrite’ and a ‘non-believer’ who was ‘contaminating people’s minds.’ Scroll Down for Video . The bombing suspects reportedly prayer and visited the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center infrequently . A banner reading ""United We Stand For Peace on Earth"" stands outside the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge. A mosque official confirmed that suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings, worshipped there . Anwar Kazmi, a member of the mosque's board of trustees said that the Tsarnaev brothers were infrequent visitors to the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center . Congregants shouted back at him, telling him to leave, and he did. Later, volunteer leaders of the . mosque met with him and told him that he would not be welcome at service . if he interrupted again. The group said he continued attending . sometimes and did not cause any more problems. Tamerlan’s younger brother, Dzhokhar, . who is in critical condition at Beth Israel Deaconess, was arraigned . Monday. Officials told the Associated Press that the brothers were . motivated by religion but appear not to be tied to any Islamic terrorist . groups. Anwar Kazmi, a member of the mosque's . board of trustees, told a USA Today reporter that 26-year-old Tamerlan . Tsarnaev, who died early Friday morning after a shootout with police, . was an infrequent attendee for about a year-and-a-half, while . 19-year-old Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, who was captured hiding in a boat in . Watertown on Friday night, attended only once. Responding to the revelation that . both brothers had attended their mosque, the Islamic Society issued a . statement to say that while the suspects were known to other worshipers, . they could not have predicted their horrific bombing of the Boston . marathon which claimed three lives and injured over 180 people. Imam Suhaib Webb, of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, the . city's largest mosque, said in an interview that he had recently heard . of the incident. 'That's a sign right there that his views aren't . mainstream,' Webb said. They pledged to aid federal and city law enforcement to leave 'no stone uncovered in finding any suspects connected to the bombs.' Ruslan Tsarni, uncle of Boston Marathon bombing suspect brothers, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev believes 'they were just puppets and executors of something of bigger scale' The brothers are believed to have placed one of the bombs near to a Boston store where their mother had been sacked for stealing clothes . Yesterday the brothers¿ mother, Zubeidat, said the FBI once told her that Tamerlan was ¿really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him' Meanwhile, the Tsarnaev bother's . uncle Ruslan Tsarni, who described the pair as 'losers' after they were . named as suspects, raised the worrying possibility that they were . radicalized by a domestic source and not a foreign one. The . lawyer said that Tamerlan especially had fallen under the thrall of an . as-yet unidentified religious leader while living in Cambridge, . Massachusetts. Ruslan . Tsarni says he grew concerned about Tamerlan Tsarnaev when he told him . in a 2009 phone conversation that he had chosen 'God's business' over . work or school. Tsarni said he then contacted a family friend who told him Tsarnaev had been influenced by a recent convert to Islam. 'There certainly were mentors,’’ Tsarni said to the Today . show. 'I was shocked when I heard his words, his phrases, when every . other word he starts sticking in words of God. I question what he’s . doing for work, (and) he claimed he would just put everything in the . will of God. [caption . 'It was a . big concern to me. He called me 'confused' when I started explaining to . him, make yourself useful to yourself and to your family and maybe . you’ll have extra to share with everybody else.' 'I strongly believe they were just puppets and executors of something of bigger scale,' Tsarni told Savannah Guthrie. The Rhode Island resident told his nephew that 'he was giving up on everything, struggling with your own shadow' by wholeheartedly turning to Islan. 'He had been sort of brainwashing him,' Tsarni told the Sunday Times of London. The brothers' parents told NBC News they believe their sons were framed and Tsarni said a family acquaintance told him there was an outside influence on Tamerlan. 'He said there is someone who brainwashed him, some new convert to Islam,’’ Tsarni said. “I would like to stress (the acquaintance was) of Armenian descent.’ The uncle also speculated that Tamerlan’s younger brother, Dzhokhar, was manipulated into the bombing plot. 'Dzhokhar is just a kid who wanted to have older brother to look up at. Except for being a murderer, he’s been a loving brother.' 'That so-called radicalization was seeded right here, not in the Caucasus, not in Russia, not in Chechnya, which he has nothing to do with,' Tsarni said. The extremist views which Tamerlan developed over the course of the past three years caught the attention of Russian security officals who asked the FBI to question him in 2011 - before he traveled to Chechnya and Dagestan last year. The FBI are said to have discovered nothing incriminating during their conversations with Tamerlan. However, friends said that Tamerlan became increasingly vocal in his views, especially concerning Christians. 'He said . . . the Koran spoke more of the truth then the Bible. He said the Bible was used as an excuse to invade other countries,' said Albrecht Ammon, 18, a student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, which the bombers also attended according to the New York Post. And it has been revealed today that Tamerlan had direct contact with Chechen terrorists – and was ‘monitored’ by investigators for five years. The FBI put Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, under surveillance after receiving an explicit warning from the Russian intelligence services. Rebel: One theory is that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was inspired by Doku Umarov, a Chechen terrorist known as Russia's Bin Laden . Umarov has recently widened his fight for Chechen independence to a wider Jihadist agenda . But despite apparently telling his mother that Tamerlan was an ‘extremist’ leader, the FBI eventually discounted the possibility that he was a threat. Yesterday the brothers’ mother, Zubeidat, said the FBI once told her that Tamerlan was ‘really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him’. She added: ‘He was controlled by the FBI for five years. They knew what my son was doing. They were following every step of his.’ And his father, Anzor Tsarnaev, said investigators warned his  son: ‘We know what sites you are on, we know where you are calling,  we know everything about you.  Everything. We are checking and watching.’ Russia's Bin Laden Doku Umarov was believed to be behind the Moscow Metro bombing in 2010 which killed at least 40 . Despite all this, the FBI found no substantive evidence that he was engaged in terror-related activities though they continued to ‘monitor his internet use and contacts’. According to an intelligence source, Russia remained convinced that Tamerlan, an ethnic Chechen, was in ‘direct contact’ with Islamist militants, most likely based in the strife-torn southern Russian region of Dagestan, where he lived for two years with his family prior to moving to the US. During a six-month visit to Russia last year – a trip US investigators are investigating –  it is understood Tamerlan visited Dagestan, which is now regarded as more unstable than Chechnya. One theory is that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, who was in thrall to his older brother, may have been ‘inspired’ by a rebel leader known as Russia’s Bin Laden. A light beam from a helicopter, top right, aims in the direction of Watertown, where officials searched for Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev on Friday . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is apprehended on Friday evening after almost 24-hours on the run following a week of terror in Boston . Doku Umarov, like the Tsarnaev brothers, is an ethnic Chechen from the war-torn Caucasus region that lies between Europe and Central Asia. He has been accused of masterminding some of the worst terrorist atrocities in Russia, including suicide bombings carried out by two women on Moscow’s Metro system in 2010 which killed at least 40. Significantly, while Umarov was originally fighting only for Chechen independence he has more recently embraced a wider jihadist agenda. It raises the terrifying prospect of further atrocities being carried out across the globe by disaffected individuals inspired by the jihadist rhetoric of the former Chechen leaders. Intriguingly, President Putin offered to ‘provide assistance’ to the investigation in Boston before it was known that there was a Chechen link to the bombing. ‘Fighting terrorism is more important than political posturing,’ said a Russian source yesterday. ‘If we work together properly and deeply, we have much more chance of defeating those who want to maim and kill.’","Tamerlan Tsarnaev was ejected from his Cambridge, Massachusetts mosque three months ago .

Britain must be more like Germany, David Cameron declared today as he warned schools are failing to prepare children for high level jobs. The Prime Minister called for a ‘Germanic approach to skills’ because companies were complained that the supply of newly trained engineers, mechanics and other skilled staff was failing to keep up with rapid expansions in business. But the comparison risked backfiring on the day that Germany cut its growth outlook for the next two years, slashing its prediction of 1.6 per cent growth for 2013 to just 0.4 per cent. David Cameron today made a series of visits in the Midlands to highlight the need for more engineers, mechanics and scientists to boost Britain's economy. His is pictured talking to Jaguar Land-Rover employee Christopher Snape (left) at the firm's plant in Solihull . Mr Cameron complained that too many . colleges worried about ‘ticking boxes’ for Whitehall and not preparing . youngsters for the world of work. As a result Britain risked falling . behind other countries in the ‘global race’. He said there would be ‘rigorous’ exams in science, maths and technology and employers should ‘get into the local colleges and tell them what it is you want’. Ministers across government are under pressure to focus on growth, with the Prime Minister putting the government on an ‘economic war footing’. Revised growth figures this week showed the economy will shrink this year by 0.1 per cent, after previously being predicted to grow by 0.8 per cent. Mr Cameron said there needed to be more 'rigorous' exams in maths and science . The PM was challenged on a visit to Lear, a car seat and electricals firm in Redditch over what he was doing to ensure UK firms could compete. During a question and answer session he said: ‘As we try and reindustrialise our country, some companies like yours are expanding so fast they are saying to us, “we can't find the engineers, we can't find the mechanics and other skills”.’ ‘There is no simple, easy answer to this because you can't create an engineer overnight. ‘You've got to go right back in the school system, which is what we are doing, and say, “right, are we encouraging kids to study the right subjects?”. ‘There was a time when local colleges were just looking up to government and saying, “right, what courses shall we study in order to tick all your boxes?” ‘We are saying, “forget that, instead of looking up to the government, get out there and meet with the companies and find out what they want you to train people up into’. ‘We need frankly to have a more Germanic approach to that skills deficit. I think we will crack it but it will take time.’ As a result of low growth and high . borrowing, austerity cuts and tax rises will last another year until . 2018, Chancellor George Osborne announced in his Autumn Statement. Mr Cameron held a 'PM Direct' question and answer session with workers at Lear Corporation in Redditch, Worcestershire where he called for a more 'Germanic' approach to skills . The PM also defended squeezing benefits while cutting corporation tax for businesses . Mr Cameron defended plans to squeeze benefits, with annual rises capped at one per cent for the next three years while cutting corporation tax for businesses to 21 per cent. ‘We are in a global race where you have countries like India and China and Indonesia and Brazil that are going absolute gangbusters and we have to recognise that's who we have to compete with. ‘It means the Government has to take tough decisions: we've got to make sure we keep our tax rates down; we've got to make sure we invest in our education system; we've got to reform welfare so it pays to work. ‘We've taken tough decisions but I think it will enable us to see our economy compete and succeed in a way that is fair to people.’","Prime Minister warns schools and colleges are not meeting demand for scientists, engineers and mechanics .

Some experts are predicting that Kate and William will end up with twins – and if they do, there could be more than just the usual parenting headaches ahead for the royal couple. No mother of a future monarch has given birth to twins in Britain since the 15th century – so nobody is quite sure what will happen if Kate makes history and produces a brace of infants next summer. And if she does, the intriguing question is: which of the children will end up on the throne? Scroll down for video . Beautiful babies: Danish Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik with their one-year-old twins Josephine and Vincent (in their arms) and children Isabella and Christian (in front) Normally, of course, this would be . little cause for discussion during a royal pregnancy. But the . debilitating symptoms currently suffered by Kate in the King Edward VII . Hospital in central London point to hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition . experienced slightly more often by women expecting twins. If it did prove to be the case that . Kate was carrying two children, and she gave birth to them naturally, . the rule of primogeniture that has dictated the royal succession for . centuries would mean that if the twins are boys, the first-born would . ascend the throne. And until recently, if the twins were boy and girl, . it would be the boy who got to wear the crown. But under new . legislation, if Kate gives birth to a mixed pair, it will be the . first-born who succeeds – no matter their gender. All that seems straightforward. But . if Kate were to require either an emergency or an elective caesarean, . then things get very much more complicated. Last year, Crown Princess Mary of . Denmark – the wife of the country’s next monarch – gave birth to twins. There was . some anxiety beforehand that her babies might have to be delivered by . caesarean section, leading to speculation that it would be the . obstetrician who chose which child to deliver first and thus in which order they would be in line to the throne after their elder siblings. Happily, she didn’t have to go . through with a caesarean section birth, and gave birth to Prince . Vincent 25 minutes ahead of his sister, . Princess Josephine. Were those circumstances to arise . here and a caesarean be required, the task of picking who would be the . future king or queen would fall, in theory, to Alan Farthing – the royal . gynaecologist still better known as the former fiance of murdered BBC . presenter Jill Dando. Mr Farthing, 47, now a distinguished . figure in the world of obstetrics, has held the royal post since 2008, . and experienced himself the joy of fatherhood for the first time early . last year when his wife Janet, 33, gave birth to a boy. But while he will be more than . prepared for the challenges ahead, it’s unlikely Mr Farthing would want . to shoulder the responsibility of choosing whom he brought into the . world first. Which begs the question – who would? Would it be William, who’s expected, . like most modern fathers, to be present  at the birth? Would the royal . family have to revert to the odd practices of yesteryear, where a . government minister had to be present at the accouchement to act as an . observer and ensure everything was above board? Last time that happened to a future . monarch was in 1926, when the present Queen was born and home secretary . Sir William Joynson-Hicks was required to be present, albeit in an . adjoining room. Should that be the case again next year the job will . fall to Theresa May, the present home secretary. Concerned: William, left, visits his pregnant wife, right, at King Edward VII Hospital in Central London . Twins: A mother cradles her 2 week old twin girls (file photo) If Kate and William really are set for double joy, there are various unusual factors to expect. Around 12,000 twin births occur each year, with around 200 triplet births and a handful of higher order births. These . numbers have been on the increase since 1980, thanks to factors . including the use of fertility drugs, assisted conception techniques and . even maternal age (older mothers are more likely to conceive . multiples). Non-identical twins are created when a . woman produces two eggs at the same time and both are fertilised, each . by a different sperm. The fertilised egg is called a zygote, and these . non-identical twins are known as dizygotic or fraternal twins. The . babies are no more alike than any other brothers or sisters. Identical . twins occur in about A third of multiple pregnancies. Known as . monozygotic twins, a single egg is fertilised splits into two (or, very . rarely, three or more) creating identical babies with the same genes, . features and sex. They may or may not share a placenta. Characteristics . such as size and personality depend on non-genetic factors, so may . differ. Triplets and . higher order multiples are formed this way too, but you may have a set . of triplets where two are identical and one is not. Faced with the prospect of choosing . which twin became the heir, the Cambridges would be able to consider . various precedents set when similar situations have arisen. Their friend the Marquess of . Cholmondeley faced such a situation three years ago when his twin sons . were born by caesarean. In the end, his ancient title went to his . first-born, Alexander, who now bears his father’s courtesy title Earl of . Rocksavage; his twin is more simply known as Lord Oliver Cholmondeley. What Kate and Wills can’t do is draw . on any recent experience in either family tree, for there’s almost no . history of twins in William’s extended family, and a trawl back through . Kate’s rich and varied ancestry comes up with very few examples – and . none in recent times. Should Kate actually prove to be . carrying twins, though, she will hope they  find better fortune than the . last pair of royal infants. In 1430, King James I  of Scotland’s wife . Queen Joan gave birth to two boys. The first, Alexander, was named as . the heir to the throne and given the title Duke of Rothesay – a title . still carried today by William’s father as Prince of Wales. The second twin, James, would have . expected an easy life – except that within a year his elder brother had . died and he assumed the Rothesay title. By the time he was six, his . father had been assassinated and he rose unsteadily to the Scottish . throne as King James II of Scotland. We no longer live in such unsettled . times, but for William and Kate, there will still be an element of . uncertainty – until they know for certain whether they have twins on the . way or not.

A postman has been saved from a life dependent upon dialysis thanks to a colleague who gave him a new kidney. Ian Shillcott, 48, suffers from polycystic kidney disease, which caused cysts to form and his kidneys to fail. Doctors warned him that he would need kidney dialysis to clean his blood within months, unless a donor could be found to allow him to have a transplant. All of his family members were tested, . but none were suitable donors, so Mr Shillcott faced a race against time . to find a compatible organ. Ian Shillcott (right) was given a new kidney by Charles Czajkowski (left) after his polycystic kidney disease caused his kidneys to fail . To his relief, his colleague, Charles Czajkowski, 44, offered to be tested - and was found to be a perfect match. The pair underwent surgery earlier this month and grandfather-of-three, Mr Shillcott, is now returning to full health. He said: ‘It is like winning the lottery because all of a sudden I have gone from falling asleep most days, to three weeks later I am absolutely buzzing. ‘It has been very emotional. Out of the blue at work one day Chalkie, as we call him, came up to me and said “by the way, I want to give you my kidney”. ‘I was floored, it was quite amazing really.’ Without a transplant, Mr Shillcott would have needed kidney dialysis to clean his blood because his kidney function had dropped to 24 per cent . Before he received the new kidney from Mr Czajkowski (right), Mr Shillcott (left) was so exhausted that he could only work part-time . Speaking of his donation, Mr Czajkowski said: ‘It is the fact it makes such a difference to somebody else. ‘People lose track of that in their lives. Every now and again something comes along that allows you to make a difference. ‘Luckily, I got to do that for somebody else.’ The postmen have worked together at the Royal Mail depot in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, for eight years – Mr Czajkowski as a door-to-door postman and Mr Shillcott in customer services. They also both own allotments and became good friends through gardening. After leaving the army 16 years ago, Mr Shillcott was diagnosed with the genetic kidney condition. It causes cysts – fluid-filled sacs – to develop in the kidneys which mean they gradually lose more and more of their function. The two men underwent surgery at Southmead Hospital in Bristol on April 5 . Symptoms include abdominal pain, blood in the urine and high blood pressure. Eventually, it can cause kidney failure which causes symptoms including tiredness and shortness of breath. If the condition is severe enough, the patient will need dialysis or a kidney transplant. There is no treatment for polycystic kidney disease. Last year Mr Shillcott’s kidney function dropped dramatically to 24 per cent meaning he was placed on the transplant list. However, no one came forward as a match and he began to resign himself to giving up his job for a future on dialysis. They are now recovering and Mr Shillcott is looking forward to getting back to normality and to returning to long distance running . He said: ‘I had been seeing my kidney function decrease and I was heading towards dialysis, I was not far off at all. ‘The plan was always to have dialysis because nobody had come forward to give me a kidney, there were just no matches. It is a genetic condition that causes multiple cysts to develop on the kidneys. Symptoms tend to begin in adulthood and include abdominal pain, high blood pressure and blood in the urine. Over time the condition causes the kidneys to lose more and more of their function. Eventually it can lead to kidney disease which has symptoms including tiredness, swollen ankles and shortness of breath. There is no treatment so patients sometimes need dialysis or a transplant. The condition affects one in every 1,000 people. ‘As my kidney function failed life had narrowed down to a sort of blinkered view of the future, I couldn't really do a lot and I was on half days because I needed to sleep so much. ‘Then out of the blue Chalkie offered me his kidney. ‘For a live donor the success rate is 98 per cent. There is always a risk and that chance it is going to fail but when someone says it is 98 per cent you have to go for it.’ After months of tests, they underwent surgery at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, on April 5. Mr Czajkowski, from Wick St Lawrence, north Somerset, said: ‘Somebody told me one day that you don't have to be deceased to be a donor, you can give certain organs while you are still alive, and I have to confess that thought never really crossed my mind. ‘There is not enough publicity, everybody thinks you have to be dead, nobody really realises you can be a live donor. ‘I think that's why it's gone so well, the kidney was live and functioning really well, so it was a lot easier to transplant.’ The pair became friends because they both enjoy gardening on their allotments . Mr Shillcott, from Weston-super-Mare, is now looking forward to returning to a normal life and to resuming long distance running. ‘I'm very much into my running, I was running up to 40 miles a week, but I had to stop six or seven months ago,’ he said. ‘I really, really miss it so I'm really looking forward to getting back into it, I did the London Marathon three years ago so I look forward to doing that again. ‘They have told me I can do what I want, no food restrictions, nothing. ‘I intend to travel and do everything I couldn't. It had all gone so narrow and I couldn't really do any of that, now it has all opened up.’","Ian Shillcott, 48, has polycystic kidney disease, which causes cysts to form .

Four government officials including Attorney General Eric Holder have spent more than $11 million of taxpayers' money being ferried around in luxury jets that are supposed to be used for counter-terrorism operations, a new report has revealed. Holder, his predecessors Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, and FBI director Robert Mueller went on nearly 700 'non-mission' trips between 2007 and 2011 - with one of the aircraft being used for executive travel a third more than for actual missions. The bulk of the flights - which cost an average of $16,285 - were taken on the FBI's two Gulfstream V jets, though the Citation CE-750 and the de Havilland Dash 8 100 were also used for non-mission travel, according to a Government Accountability Office report released on Thursday. Gulfstream: The bulk of the flights were taken on the FBI's expensive Gulfstream V jet, pictured, of which it has two . The Gulfstream costs just under $5,000 an hour to run, while the Citation costs around $3,700 an hour. Nearly three-quarters of the flights were business related, for purposes like conferences, meetings and field office visits, while 24 per cent of travel was for personal reasons, most of which related to Holder's travel. The officials were required to use government aircraft for security and safety reasons, and in some cases reimbursed the government for a portion of the expenses, for example $420.80 for a 2010 trip to New York that cost $15,894. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said given the hefty cost the officials should pass up the luxury Gulfstream V jets or reduce their air miles. Travel: Attorney General Eric Holder, pictured left, and his predecessors regularly used the jets as did FBI director Robert Mueller, right, though less for personal travel . 'These luxury jets were supposedly needed for counter-terrorism, but it turns out that they were used almost two-thirds of the time for jet-setting executive travel,' he said. 'Nobody disputes that the Attorney General and the FBI Director should have access to the secure communications, but, for instance, there’s no reason they can't take a less expensive mode of transportation, or cut their personal travel.' The report says the jets are primarily there to accomplish and provide support for such things as transporting prisoners; preventing illicit drug trafficking into and within the United States; and conducting a variety of counter-terrorism, intelligence, and criminal surveillance activities. The cost attributed to attorney general travel was $5.8 million while the FBI director's travel was almost as expensive at $5.6 million. Non-mission travel: Travel by the Attorney General composed 53 per cent of the flights, while the FBI Director's composed 42 per cent. Around $1 million was spent ferrying other Department of Justice executives around, including the FBI's Deputy Director . Aircraft: The $5,000 an hour Gulfstream was used in 61 per cent of the officials' trips . Attorneys General and the FBI Director's travel constituted 95 per cent - 659 out of 697 flights - of all non-mission flights. Travel by the Attorney General composed 53 per cent of the flights or 366 out of 697, while the FBI Director's travel composed 42 per cent or 293. Around $1 million was spent ferrying other Department of Justice executives around, including the FBI's Deputy Director. Attorneys General took 56 per cent or 206 out of 366 flights for business reasons and 41 per cent - 151 out of 366 - for personal reasons, while the FBI Director took 97 per cent - 284 out of 293 - for business reasons and 2 per cent or 7 flights for personal reasons. Officials provided reimbursements of the applicable full coach fare for their personal travel, though this amount is generally a fraction of the cost of a flight on the Gulfstream, the report said. The FBI Director until 2011 was allowed to travel on commercial airlines for personal reasons and did regularly, while the Attorney General is required to fly the government's fleet for both business and personal travel. Before many of the flights, the planes had to be flown from another location to Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington D.C. to pick up the officials and be flown back to their base once the trip was completed - something which added $1.5 million to the bill.","Attorney General Eric Holder, his .

Mississippi is officially the fattest state in the country, with almost 36 per cent of its residents falling under the classification. The slimmest state is Colorado but even there 21 per cent of people are unhealthily overweight. As the obesity epidemic continues more than a third of the population in 12 U.S. states are clinically obese. Shocking: There are now 12 states where obesity levels are at 30 per cent or more . Heavy weight: People with a BMI of 30 or more are considered to be obese . Other offenders include Louisiana, with a rate of 33.4 per cent, West Virginia where the total is 32.4 per cent and Alabama with 32% of its population labeled obese. Of the 30 states with the highest obesity rates 26 are in the Midwest and South, with many of the healthier states being found along the east coast, including New York, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. The study, carried out by the Trust for America's Health (TFAH) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was conducted over the phone. It is the first of its kind to include households without landline telephones, bringing in a larger proportion of the population. Its findings were released on Monday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on body mass index calculations. Epidemic: Rising levels of obesity is a major problem sweeping the United States . People with a BMI of 30 or more are considered to be obese and are at risk of serious health defects. 'Obesity has contributed to a stunning rise in chronic disease rates and health care costs. It is one of the biggest health crises the country has ever faced,' said Jeffrey Levi, PhD, TFAH executive director. 'The good news is that we have a growing body of evidence and approaches that we know can help reduce obesity, improve nutrition and increase physical activity based on making healthier choices easier for Americans. 'The bad news is we're not investing anywhere near what we need to in order to bend the obesity curve and see the returns in terms of health and savings.' The report comes as the U.S. launches initiatives to try to lower the number of dangerously overweight Americans. In New York mayor Bloomberg banned trans-fat in a move that has since been copied by more than a dozen other state and local governments. He has also banned soft drinks bigger than 16oz. An Atlanta ad campaign featured images of overweight children with slogans such as 'chubby kids may not outlive parents' to try to promote healthy eating and across the country $70 million in federal funding is available to help states and communities address the root causes of obesity. Monday's report comes as it is revealed that one in five schoolchildren are obese, with the onus being put on schools to set in place stricter junk food regulations. The latest report on obesity-related medical bills, from 2011, found that in 2006 costs totaled $147 billion, the majority of which was spent treating diseases such as diabetes. Experts fear this cost could soar if intervention is unsuccessful. 'Our nation has made important inroads to creating healthier communities,' said Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, MD, RWJF president and CEO. Rising: Obesity levels have soared since 2004, when there were no states with a rate of 30 per cent or more . In the past few years the rates have soared, giving need for a 'more than 35%' category in the 2012 map that wasn't there before . 'Some cities and states that have taken comprehensive action to address the epidemic are beginning to see declines in their obesity rates. But we need to expand and intensify our efforts. Investing in prevention today will mean a healthier tomorrow for our children.' Later this summer RWJF and TFAH will release the annual report F as in Fat, analysing state obesity rates and policy efforts to address the epidemic, as well as recommendations. It will include details on where costs could be saved from citizens achieving a mere five per cent BMI reduction. For a six-foot-tall person weighing 200 pounds, a 5 per cent reduction in BMI would be the equivalent of losing roughly 10 pounds. The report will also, for the first time, forecast 2030 obesity rates in each state and the likely resulting rise in obesity-related disease rates and health care costs. Until 2005 no states had a 30 per cent or more obesity rate. Since 2009 the issue has intesified, with soaring numbers tipping the scales at dangerous levels.","Mississippi is the fattest state with almost 36 per cent of its citizens in the obese range .

There’s a disturbing new theory behind the UK’s lack of success in the Eurovision Song Contest - racism. Senior figures linked to a number of former UK entries have told me they experienced racism behind the scenes and were openly told that acts ­featuring ethnic minorities would not be supported by many of the voting nations. Since 2005, UK acts including Javine Hylton, Andy Abraham, Jade Ewen, and boyband Blue have done badly in the contest, despite strong performances. Fair play? Javine Hylton was one UK star who flopped . Now several industry figures are pressing the BBC to cut ties with the competition for good. One entry tells me: ‘We were told repeatedly when we were touring our song around Europe that we didn’t have a chance because of the race factor. ‘We didn’t believe it at the time. Then on the night our vote was very low in certain countries. Organisers were very open that there is a track record for some nations refusing to cast votes for acts featuring ethnic minorities. ‘We found the entire experience devastating and strongly believe the UK needs to withdraw. It’s a joke.’ Jade Ewen, left,  and Andy Abraham, right, have both flopped at Eurovision . A manager of another former UK hopeful says: ‘When we returned home and everyone was asking us what went wrong, it didn’t feel right to mention the race factor but it’s well known in the industry the impact it has on votes.’ Even Andrew Lloyd Webber is believed to have been caught up in the Eurovision race debate. He co-wrote the song that Jade Ewen, who has a Jamaican mother, came fifth in 2009. A member of the UK camp that year adds: ‘Jade won a TV talent show in the UK to perform Andrew’s song. Andrew lobbied for her around the Eurovision countries before the contest. At least once he was asked at a press conference why he had 'cast a black girl' because it meant he could never win. ‘He was so shocked, he had to ask several times for a translator to repeat the question.’ This week, pop flop Sophie Ellis Bextor ruled herself out of being our next Eurovision entry, and song contest sources pointed out the UK has struggled with all-white acts Scooch and Josh Dubovie in recent years — and TV ratings have stayed stable, despite the results. A Beeb spokesman said: 'The BBC is committed to Eurovision and has no evidence of any ­racism around the event.' Myleene is at the top of every TV boss's wish-list . Myleene Klass is at the top of the presenting wish-lists of BBC and ITV bosses — but she’s not taking on any new work after her marriage split. My source says: ‘Myleene is hot property. Everyone wants to get her for a big show. She’s always been popular with broadcasters.’ But after Myleene’s ­husband Graham Quinn walked out on her in April — on her ­birthday — a pal says: ‘She just needs some time to get her head together. ‘It’s not about work right now, regardless of what offers come in.’ Hard-up BBC bosses have confirmed that the Saturday night TV series The Magicians has vanished from our screens. I’m told the decision to axe the show was a major surprise to producers of the series — in which magicians taught celebrities how to perform elaborate tricks on live TV — but the Beeb needs to save money after committing . £25 million to flop show The Voice for two years. A show source tells me: ‘This is a huge disappointment. Viewers loved The Magicians and on some nights we got more viewers than The Voice, despite far less promotion.’The BBC and producers Shine said last night: ‘We can confirm that a third series will not be commissioned by the BBC.’ In this age of equal opportunities, ITV had to agree that women would be eligible to audition to play Jesus in its upcoming Andrew Lloyd Webber musical talent show Superstar. So imagine the relief of show executives when only two out of more than 10,000 auditionees were female. Both have now been ruled out — so the sex of Jesus Christ will not need to be adjusted for the upcoming UK arena tour of the show. However, one of the women who auditioned for Andrew and acclaimed director David Grindrod won’t regret her efforts — the pair are ­considering her for a role in another famous West End musical, possibly Phantom Of The Opera. Danni Minogue was devastated when Simon Cowell revealed their romance in his book . My show source reveals: ‘Searching for . Jesus on a TV talent show is ­controversial enough before adding in a . chance of a woman in the role. ‘But Andrew and David eagerly watched . both performances. One girl was so good Andrew has asked that she be . put forward for another one of his shows.’ It’s not been decided if the ­women’s auditions will be screened when the show, hosted by Amanda Holden, begins next month. Just one phone call from Simon Cowell could have got Dannii Minogue back on the X Factor judging panel. ‘ITV were desperate to get Dannii back,’ says my source. ‘Nicole Scherzinger was only a fallback option, but Simon needed to pick up the phone to Dannii.

Pleased: Miss Ecclestone leaves the High Court with her fiance Jay Rutland having won the first stage of her legal battle today . Row: Tamara leaving the Lamborghini Aventador at the heart of the case, which her ex sold claiming it was a gift but she says it wasn't and wants it back . Omar Khyami alleges that, although . Miss Ecclestone bought the car, she gave it to him as a 38th birthday . present last April. She denies this and claims it always belonged to . her. However, Miss Ecclestone secured a . minor victory in the first round of her fight for the Lamborghini . following a hearing at the High Court yesterday.

Special: The Lamborghini is one of the world's rarest cars and has allegedly been sold to a Turkish national who is trying to have it shipped out of the UK . Instead it will be stored in a garage of her choice until the matter had been resolved. Miss Ecclestone and Mr Khyami dated . for two and a half years but three months after being given the keys to . the sports car, their relationship came to an end after Mr Khyami was . caught on a sex tape and the footage sent to her billionaire father . Bernie. Miss Ecclestone initially kept the . car following their split but matters came to a head this month when it . was taken to a garage in Acton, west London, for a routine service. What then followed was an . extraordinary chain of events. While at the garage, bailiffs from . Central London county court impounded the car. Unbeknown to Miss . Ecclestone, 28, Mr Khyami had used the Lamborghini as security for a . £250,000 loan with Elite Performance Cars – the dealership which sold . her the car – and was being charged a staggering interest rate of 70 per . cent. Despite the car being impounded, Mr . Khyami allegedly persuaded bailiffs to release the Lamborghini, and he . gave the vehicle to Elite, apparently in settlement of his debts. The car was then sold to a company . called Ansol Trading for £118,000 cash plus a £132,000 Mercedes in part . exchange, and then sold again to a Turkish buyer. Blocked: Omar Khyami leaves the £380,000 car in June 2012 when he and Tamara Ecclestone were a couple. His ex gained an injunction keeping it under lock and key in Britain today . Commenting on the complicated . sequence of events, Mr Justice Warren said that if the Lamborghini was . never a gift to Mr Khyami, then he never had title to it and could not . sell it. He added Mr Khyami had got the car . back in ‘extraordinary and unusual circumstances’ and said: ‘The . underlying dispute is about the ownership of the car. It is between the . complainant and the first defendant. ‘She is saying that it is hers and he . is saying that although she bought it, he was given it as a present . during the currency of their relationship. ‘Miss Ecclestone is entitled to see it sitting in a safe place which is not connected with any of the defendants.’ Within hours of the relationship . breaking down between Miss Ecclestone and Mr Khyami, it is believed she . began dividing their assets into ‘his and hers’ lots worth hundreds of . thousands of pounds. First, she locked up her collection . of supercars, which they both drove – including the Lamborghini . Aventador and a Ferrari 599 worth £212,096 – in a private garage away . from the £4million Chelsea home the couple shared. The model and television presenter . then arranged for two other cars and jewellery worth more than £145,000 . to be delivered to Mr Khyami’s mother’s house in Mayfair, Central . London. The items included a yellow gold . Cartier ‘Love’ bracelet worth £26,250 and matching silver one costing . £36,500. The cars included a £123,000 white Bentley with personalised . ‘T48’ numberplates, a Christmas present from Mr Khyami, and a £76,000 . black Range Rover Sport. The injunction protecting the . safe-keeping of the Lamborghini remains in force until the dispute . between Miss Ecclestone, Mr Khyami, Elite and Ansol is resolved.

And the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance has fallen to its lowest level in nearly two years. But wages continue to fall in real terms, with pay rises lagging far behind the rate of inflation. Climbing: The number of people in work is at a record high as the economic recovery continues . Positive: The unemployment rate fell to 7.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 . Figures from the Office for . National Statistics showed that unemployment fell by 14,000 in the final . quarter of last year to a total of 2.5million, or 7.8 per cent. In addition, 12,500 fewer people claimed jobseeker's allowance, with the total of 1.54million being the lowest since June 2011. Overall, . 29.73million held some sort of job, the largest number ever recorded - . 71.5 per cent of the UK population. That is a rise of 154,000 between . September and December. There was a shift in employment from part-time jobs to full-time, reversing one of the recession's most worrying trends. The number of people in full-time work increased by almost 200,000, while there were 43,000 fewer part-timers. Boom: Employment is up and joblessness continues to fall despite the poor state of the economy . Sluggish: Wages are growing more slowly than inflation, leading to a real-terms pay cut for most . Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and . Pensions Secretary, pointed to ONS statistics showing that the number of . people out of work for more than a year had fallen by 15,000, to . 879,000. 'The fall in . long-term unemployment is particularly welcome and shows that the . training and support we are offering is helping people move off benefits . and into work,' he said. 'These figures show another big increase in full-time jobs, half a million more British people in work over the past year and more women in employment than ever before. 'The UK is now ahead of many of its international rivals when it comes to cutting unemployment and creating jobs which is so important as we compete in a global race.' Clash: Iain Duncan Smith, left, claimed today's figures show the jobs market is healthy, but his Labour opposite number Liam Byrne, right, called for stronger measures to boost economic growth . However, there was less good news in . the youth unemployment figures, as it emerged that 11,000 more young . people were out of a job. In total 974,000 16- to 24-year-olds are currently looking for work - a youth unemployment rate of 20.8 per cent. The governor of the Bank of England believes that more extraordinary measures are needed to boost the economy, it emerged today. Sir Mervyn King and two other senior Bank figures voted for further quantitative easing at this month's meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. However, their proposal to inject another £25billion in an attempt to re-start economic growth was voted down after the other six members of the committee opposed it. The MPC decided instead to use more targeted measures to return the UK to growth, after the national economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2012. QE - which essentially amounts to printing money - has been controversial because of its potential to cause or worsen inflation. And average wages also continue to flag, rising just 1.4 per cent over the past year to reach £472 per week, roughly £24,600 per year. Since inflation is standing at 2.7 per cent by the CPI measure, that means the average worker has less spending power now than a year ago. Wage growth has been lower than inflation since mid-2008, which marked the start of the recession which has devastated the British economy. The average employee works 31.9 hours per week, up slightly from the year before. Shadow . work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: 'Today's fall in the . headline rate of unemployment is welcome but it is now clearer than ever . that British workers are paying the price to get a job or keep a job. 'People . have now taken an average £1,200 pay cut since the election because . jobs are so hard to come by and today we see there's still more than . five people chasing every vacancy. 'Youth . unemployment has risen yet again, back towards the million mark, the . number of women out of work has gone up and long-term unemployment is . still far too high. 'What Britain now needs from next month's Budget is an industrial-strength back-to-work programme to match the crisis we face.' Lagging: Wage growth has been lower than inflation since the start of the recession in 2008 . Good news: The number of unemployed people has fallen but wages continue to rise slowly . Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, said: 'That we have mass unemployment of two and a half million five years into this recession is waste on a grand scale. 'To this must be added the millions in enforced temporary and part time jobs and those massively underemployed. 'What is tragic is that there is no light at the end of the tunnel as we are in the middle of a triple dip recession.' The CBI welcomed the figures, but expressed worries that lagging wages 'show we are not out of the woods yet'. Neil Carberry, director for employment and skills, said: 'It is particularly good that so much of this month's jobs growth is driven by full timers, given worries about under-employment.' Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: 'The UK jobs market continues to astound. We are in the middle of both a jobs boom and a pay slump as jobseekers struggle to gain or retain employment in a stagnant economy by pricing themselves into work. 'This is unlike anything seen in this country since the Second World War, with the economy using more and more people at falling real rates of pay to produce a static level of output.'","More Britons are in work than ever before as unemployment falls to 7.8% .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 10:11 EST, 25 November 2011 . At least six people with HIV stopped taking their medication and died after churches claimed God could cure them, an investigation has found. Undercover reporters who posed as worshippers infected with HIV in south London were told that pastors could heal them. The journalists underwent a 'healing process' where they were sprayed in the face with water while a member of the church called for the devil to come out. Scroll down for video . Claims: An undercover reporter tells a member of the church she has HIV. She responds that God can help free them and set them free . Pastors at the Synagogue Church of All Nations in Southwark boasted that they had a '100 per cent success rate', said Sky News which carried out the investigation. The church holds the healing sessions once a month and asks people to hand over medical notes to prove they have an illness. They use special 'anointing water' to 'cure' people. The bizarre claims have been refuted by the Department of Health and a former Health Secretary. Rachel Holmes, one of the pastors, told a reporter that if symptoms persist it is simply HIV leaving the body. 'We have many people that contract HIV. All are healed,' she told Sky News. 'Healing': The reporter is told that if it is 'God's plan' she can be cured . The woman at the church tells the HIV sufferer that she will be cured and will no longer need her medication . 'We've had people come back before saying, ""Oh I'm not healed. The diarrhoea I had when I had HIV, I've got it again"". 'I have to stop them and say, ""No, please, you are free"".' The Synagogue Church of All Nations has a presence around the world and members are expected to give money. It is also a registered charity in Britain - which confers a variety of tax advantages. A man called Emmanuel, who went to another church, stopped taking his pills a year ago after being told he was cured. He said the priest told him being cured does not take one day. Former Health secretary Lord Fowler said: 'It is bad advice, it is foolish advice and it is tragic advice because the consequences of this kind of advice can only be that people pass on HIV and can only be seriously bad for the individual concerned - including death' 'Cured': Emmanuel says he stopped taking medication after being told by a church in another area of the country that he had been healed . Documents reveal that at least six . people have died across the UK - three of them in London - because they . have stopped taking medication after they were told by a church they . were healed. There is no evidence that any of the people who died went to the Synagogue Church of All Nations. In testimonies on its website, the church claims it has 'cured' people of cervical cancer, anorexia and heart disease. A spokesman for the Department of Health said prayer is not a substitute for taking medication. He said: 'We are very concerned if people are not taking their HIV medication based on advice from faith leaders. 'HIV treatment is highly effective but it requires patients to take their HIV medication as prescribed by their doctor. 'Our advice is clear that faith and prayer are not a substitute for any form of treatment, especially for HIV treatment.' A spokesman for the Synagogue Church of All Nations, London branch, said: 'We are not the Healer; God is the Healer. Never a sickness God cannot heal. 'If somebody is healed, it is God who heals. 'We don’t ask people to stop taking medication. Doctors treat; God heals. Medical doctors do their work, just as ministers of God do. 'We sent a team of doctors, nurses and counsellors to help after the earthquake in Haiti, as well as to many other troubled nations, as you can see from our full documentary on Emmanuel TV. You will see the regard we have for medical doctors; I mean, the power of nature. 'There is nothing bad in using medication. It was the same medication that sustained these people before they came to the church. However, they believed that God is the God of nature.'","Church boasts it has a '100% success rate'

Child benefit could only be paid for the first two children under radical reforms being considered at the Treasury. Senior sources confirmed that as the Coalition looks to trim more from Britain’s bloated welfare bill, one option is to limit future payments of the handout by family size. The proposal goes further than Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith’s suggestion that workless families could have child benefit and child tax credits limited if they insist on having more than two children. Hint at reform: Financial Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke (left) said the government was looking at restrictions to child benefit which could go further than those mooted by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (right) for families who have more than two children . Instead, child benefit could be paid to all families, whether in work or not, for the first two offspring but not for subsequent children. Ministers say benefit would not be removed from existing families, so could only apply in the future. The reform would be far simpler to administrate than a complicated means-tested removal of benefit from lower income households. The Treasury has already had to introduce a complex system of means testing at the other end of the income scale, as child benefit is reduced for families where one earner is on more than £50,000 and removed altogether from those earning £60,000 or more. But it would prove hugely controversial among Conservative backbenchers, who are already concerned about the backlash generated by Chancellor George Osborne’s existing changes. These come into force in January, but at present all parents with young children are given the benefit worth £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for each subsequent child. Exploring all options: Under the reforms being considered by the Treasury, families would get child benefit for the first two offspring only (file picture) For a couple with two children, it is worth £1,752 a year, while for a couple with three children it is worth £2,448 a year. A senior Treasury source told the Daily Mail: ‘All options are being looked at in this area. ‘It’s not something we can do retrospectively. The main focus is on the incentives that apply to workless households as opposed to working households. You could just do that with child tax credits. But we are looking in detail at child benefit as well. We are looking at various options.’ Another Treasury source said: ‘No details, including whether it would apply to people in work, are settled, and it would only apply to new children.’ Financial Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke hinted at broader reform in an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Moneybox programme. Controversial: Conservative backbenchers are already concerned about the backlash generated by Chancellor George Osborne's existing changes to child benefit . Asked if he supported Mr Duncan Smith’s ‘two child policy’, Mr Gauke said: ‘Iain Duncan Smith has set out a proposal in that area. That’s something that collectively across government we are looking at, including for child benefit. ‘Clearly that’s something we would need to look at in some detail but there is a point about the fact that those people who are in work have to make decisions when they have additional children as to whether they can afford to do that or not... ‘It’s important that the welfare system works in such a way that everybody is faced with a degree of responsibility as to the children they have and whether they are able to afford that.’ Asked whether child benefit might be limited to the first two children, he added: ‘We are looking at it in terms of the welfare bill across the board as to how that might work.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government is exploring further options for making the welfare system fairer and more affordable, and details will be announced in due course.’ Senior Conservatives insist that removing or cutting child benefit from the top 15 per cent of earners remains one of the Government’s ‘most popular policies’, with a poll showing that even a majority of those affected back the idea. Despite warnings of a potential bureaucratic nightmare, and crippling marginal tax rates for higher-earning couples with big families, ministers are pressing ahead with plans to restrict the benefit paid to 1.2million households. Affected families have started to receive letters from HM Revenue & Customs giving them the choice of stopping receiving benefit or having cash clawed back at the end of the year through the tax system. A Populus poll commissioned by the Conservative Party found that 82 per cent of people support the policy, including 78 per cent of people with children under the age of 18. It was backed by 80 per cent of households with income between £41,000 and £55,000.","Restrictions would apply to all families whether they are in work or not .

"By . Emma Clark . PUBLISHED: . 03:05 EST, 21 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:34 EST, 22 October 2012 . More than a quarter of MPs have billed the taxpayer for first-class rail travel in the past year - despite a supposed crackdown on the practice. A study of MPs' expenses yesterday revealed that 185 had claimed for first-class rail tickets rather than travel in standard class. Those involved include Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Cabinet Office Minister Norman Baker, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and his wife, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. George Osborne in First Class on the train from Wilmslow to London with his aide watching a DVD . The claims were made by 113 Labour MPs, 48 Conservatives, 19 Liberal Democrats, three Scottish National Party and two Plaid Cymru members. Ten members of Ed Miliband’s front-bench team are among the Labour claimants. The findings came as the Government tried to play down embarrassment over Chancellor George Osborne’s decision to travel in a first-class carriage after purchasing a standard ticket on Friday. His office insisted he had always intended to pay for the upgrade and that an aide had sought out the train manager to do so. He is alleged to have found himself in the same situation in May, when he was also caught with a standard ticket in First Class. However, on that occasion he is said to have refused to pay the upgrade and instead 'slummed it' with ordinary travellers in economy class for the rest of the journey between London and his constituency in Tatton, Cheshire. A commuter who was on the train in May told the Sunday Mirror: 'Mr Osborne was confronted in first class by an inspector. The official seemed a bit embarrassed by the whole thing but quite correctly he treated Mr Osborne like anyone else. 'After a short discussion Mr Osborne gathered up his things and moved to a different carriage and slummed it with everyone else. 'I was a bit shocked to see the Chancellor trying to blag a cheap seat. I'd have thought with the money he has that he could afford the ticket.' The Chancellor faced embarrassment after being caught in the First Class carriage with the wrong ticket . After getting off the train George Osborne was confronted by journalists who had seen a string of tweets about the fiasco . But a television reporter travelling . on the same train claimed that the aide had actually got into a . confrontation with an inspector over whether he should have moved to . standard. According to . The Sunday Telegraph’s analysis, some of the first-class ticket claims . have cost as much as £300, five times as much as the cheapest standard . fare for the same route. Ipsa's . guidelines on travel expenses suggest MPs should consider ‘value for . money’ and whether cheaper, inflexible tickets will end up costing more . if travel arrangements change at short notice. ‘You can claim for first-class travel if it is less than the cost of a standard open fare,’ it states. First-class tickets purchased far . enough in advance can end up cheaper than open standard tickets bought . shortly before the journey. But . Taxpayers' Alliance chief executive Matthew Sinclair said: ‘If MPs can . get themselves organised to order a first-class ticket in advance, they . should be able to order a standard-class ticket in plenty of time as . well and it will almost always be cheaper. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, left, and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, right, are among the MPs who have travelled first-class on trains and claimed the cost on expenses . ‘If standard-class travel isn't good enough for MPs, it isn't good enough for ordinary commuters who pay for their own tickets.’ George . Osborne was forced to hand over nearly £200 by a railway ticket . inspector during his trip on the 3.11pm Virgin Trains service from . Wilmslow, Cheshire, to London Euston this week. Rachel Townsend, a journalist with Granada TV, tweeted from the train: ‘Very interesting train journey to Euston Chancellor George Osborne just got on at Wilmslow with a STANDARD ticket and he has sat in FIRST CLASS. ‘His aide tells ticket collector he cannot possibly move and sit with the likes of us in standard class and requests he is allowed to remain in First Class. Ticket collector refuses.’ Her account was disputed by sources close to Mr Osborne, who insisted there was never any question of him not paying for the upgrade – and it came to £189.90 for the two tickets. The source said: ‘The Chancellor got a different train than planned due to a diary change following a series of meetings in his constituency. ‘As he had no seat reservation on the new train which was crowded, he decided to upgrade – and obviously intended and was happy to pay. An aide sorted the ticket upgrade.’","In the past year 185 MPs have claimed for first-class train tickets on expenses .

"By . Ryan Kisiel and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 19:01 EST, 26 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:15 EST, 26 February 2013 . A senior Liberal Democrat was last night sensationally accused of trying to gag a whistleblower who spoke out over the spiralling sexual harassment scandal engulfing the party. On Monday night, Lord Stoneham made an ‘aggressive’ telephone call to a former party activist who had complained she had witnessed the former Liberal Democrat chief executive Lord Rennard molesting a party member more than a decade ago. He was apparently furious that she had contacted the Daily Mail to complain that her allegations had been swept under the carpet when she tried to raise the alarm at the time. Peers: Lord Ben Stoneham introduced to the Lords (left) standing next to Lord Rennard (right) The woman, whose identity we are not revealing, said she had been left deeply upset by the conversation – which suggests that even this week, as the scandal was unfolding, senior party figures were attempting to silence the whistleblowers. Last night Lib Dem president Tim Farron said Lord Stoneham’s intervention had been ‘wholly unacceptable’, while sources close to Nick Clegg said he had been reprimanded by the party’s chief whip. The peer, who was the Lib Dems’ director of operations at the height of the claims against Lord Rennard, will now be subject to the party’s two inquiries into the affair. Senior sources suggested the woman would even be encouraged to contact Scotland Yard detectives who are assessing the allegations against Lord Rennard. The Daily Mail has learned that complaints were made to Ben Stoneham, as the party’s then director of operations, about Lord Rennard’s alleged inappropriate behaviour in 2003. But Lord Stoneham, who was recommended for a peerage by Mr Clegg in 2011, is accused of failing to investigate the accusations thoroughly. After witnessing a young female political researcher upset by Lord Rennard’s alleged touching at a hotel during an ‘away weekend’, a senior activist said she went through official channels and reported the incident. She complained to Lord Stoneham, who was in charge of all human resource issues. The Lib Dems are too dodgy - we're voting for Silvio Berlusconi . The Lib Dem member, who is still active in local government, said she approached him in his office and asked if they could discuss Lord Rennard’s behaviour. Lord Stoneham is said to have replied: ‘That’s not very clever. He [Lord Rennard] has been silly. I will speak to him and deal with it.’ Shortly after the Mail put the claims about the 2003 complaints to Lord Stoneham, he rang the female activist while she was putting her children to bed. The woman said: ‘He rang up and said “I’m not very happy as I’ve just had a call from the Daily Mail”. He demanded to know why I was speaking to journalists just days before the Eastleigh by-election and branded me silly. ‘His tone was very harsh and it just took me back to the intimidating atmosphere when I was working in the party’s headquarters ten years ago. I reported it straight away to Tim Farron as people shouldn’t be put off from coming forward. ‘I know of two other people who reported the incident to Ben at the time and everyone was aware of it. But nothing was done and Lord Rennard was not formally interviewed or disciplined by the party. ‘A lot of us who complained were later marginalised and dismissed as ‘silly girls’ or ‘hormonal women’ by getting upset about the claims and making an issue of it.’ Last night a senior Liberal Democrat source said Mr Clegg regarded Lord Stoneham’s behaviour as ‘completely unacceptable’ and said he had been rebuked by chief whip Alistair Carmichael. The source added: ‘He has been left under no illusion that that is what people think. This is all now going to have to form part of the independent investigations.’ Mr Farron said: ‘His actions were wholly unacceptable and this conversation will now form part of our independent investigations. The party has a duty of care to the alleged victims, and they are my priority – as is the need to ensure that due process is properly followed.’ When questioned by the Mail, Lord Stoneham did not deny that complaints were made to him about Lord Rennard’s behaviour in 2003. He said: ‘There is an investigation and I’m not going to talk about internal party matters to the Daily Mail.’ Lord Stoneham ran the party’s headquarters under leaders Charles Kennedy, Menzies Campbell and Mr Clegg. He failed three times to get elected to the House of Commons. Minister for women: Jo Swinson . Women targeted in the alleged sexual harassment scandal were referred to as ‘Rennard’s red hot babes’, a former Liberal Democrat councillor claimed yesterday. The woman, who asked to be identified only as ‘Susan’, said she and at least nine other women had been on the receiving end of unwanted advances from Lord Rennard in incidents dating back to 2001. In an extraordinary interview, she also said she had confided in a number of senior figures – including Norman Lamb, a close ally of Nick Clegg – over the peer’s conduct. It is the first time Mr Lamb, a health minister, has been linked to the affair. It means a string of senior Lib Dems,  including Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and minister for women Jo Swinson, are now facing questions about what they knew of the allegations. Speaking to the BBC’s World at One, she said: ‘Jo [Swinson] did the best she could with a bad situation, because at the time, we were all saying, we don’t want this to go public, we really don’t want this to go public, we don’t want to be in the public domain. ‘In fact at one point, someone referred to us as “Rennard’s red hot babes”.’ ‘We didn’t want any of these headlines,’ she added. Susan also said it was clear that Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg ‘didn’t know how to deal with it and then didn’t deal with it well’. She said she had told Mr Lamb, Miss Swinson and former party president Baroness Scott about an ‘extremely distressing’ encounter with Lord Rennard at a hotel in 2008, where he was talking to women activists about how they could become MPs. After dinner, she said, Lord Rennard sat next to her. She claimed: ‘At first I thought it was an accident – his leg brushed against me and then his hand brushed against my leg. ‘So I moved away a little. And then he moved a little closer. And I moved away again, and the brushing of my leg kept continuing. ‘So I kept moving further away. And eventually I said, “Look I’m going to go off to bed”. And he said “I’ll walk up with you”.’ Despite her protests, Lord Rennard walked her upstairs, she claimed, and suggested that she join him in his room for another drink – a suggestion she ‘very politely and very firmly’ rejected. She said: ‘Of course men do try it on, but this is a man with an almighty amount of power. At the time he held the purse strings for any winnable seat.’","Lord Stoneham made 'aggressive' phone call to woman on Monday night .

BBC bosses were well aware of allegations about Sir Jimmy Savile’s targeting of teen girls as long ago as the 1970s, former staff have claimed. Despite increasing evidence of abuse carried out on BBC premises, the corporation has said it has no record of complaints about him. However, former BBC Press officer Rodney Collins insisted the BBC was ‘certainly’ aware of allegations about the star when he was there in the 1970s. Former press officer Rodney Collins claims that the late Douglas Muggeridge, a former Radio 1 controller, knew of the allegations involving Jimmy Savile and underage girls . He revealed that he had been called . in to see his boss at the time, Douglas Muggeridge, controller of Radio . 1 and Radio 2, and was asked to investigate the possibility that claims . about the TV presenter were going to appear in the Press. Mr Collins said he was told by the radio  boss that there were . allegations involving underage girls surrounding a programme the star . was making for Radio 1, called Savile’s Travels. This saw the presenter . travelling around the country in a caravan. In addition, a former Top of the Pops dancer said her fellow performers . made complaints to BBC staff and the producer of the show about Savile’s . lewd behaviour. The actress and model, who danced for Top of the Pops . between 1964 and 1966, said staff working on the programme were aware . that the presenter targeted young girls and dragged them into his . dressing room. She added that she even complained directly to the show’s producer, who . had also received reports of abuse from other dancers, but the problem . was ignored. She said: ‘He once tried to pull me in… but I managed to get away.’ The commemorative plaque outside Sir Jimmy Savile's flat in Scarborough has been vandalised after allegations have been made about the TV presenter . Earlier in the week other ex-BBC staff said bosses had ‘turned a blind . eye’ to his behaviour and that it had been an ‘open secret’.Ex-Press . officer Mr Collins speaking to the BBC said when he checked with . newspapers about the allegations he was told they were unlikely to be . printed ‘because Jimmy Savile does a lot for charity’. He added Mr . Muggeridge was an honourable man and thought if he had felt there was . weight to the allegations he would have made full inquiries. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The comments made by the former Press officer . reflect a conversation that he says he had in 1973 about allegations . that the controller of Radio 1 had heard but he does not refer to any . formal complaint having been made.’ Fresh accusations about Jimmy Savile have been made today by a former BBC press officer . Savile . was knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award . which followed the OBE he was given for services to charity and . broadcasting in 1971. The new accusations come as the BBC made a humiliating U-turn, as it finally announced a joint inquiry . with police into claims that Savile abused underage girls. The . about-face came on the eve of last night's devastating ITV programme, Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile, which alleged that the star exploited his fame to rape and molest . girls as young as 12. In the past few days, the BBC . insisted it had searched old files and found ‘no record’ of any . misconduct. But a chorus of victims has claimed Savile groomed them by . offering tickets to attend his hit shows such as Top of the Pops and his . Radio One show. The scandal around the dead star has deepened, with some vandals daubing 'paedophile' and 'rapist' on the commemorative plaque outside his former Scarborough home. The fresh accusations come after it was alleged yesterday that the Jim'll Fix It star raped a woman when she was 16. The grandmother, now 65, claims she met Savile in 1963 when she was invited to speak on Radio Luxembourg, for which he was a DJ, about her Elvis Presley fan club. He told her he was going to meet Elvis the following month and asked her to give him a photograph of herself that he could show The King. The teenager obliged and was delighted when, upon his return, Savile phoned her home to invite her to his London hotel because . he had a gift to give her ‘from Elvis’. The junior secretary walked to his Russell Square hotel after work, feeling ‘as if I had died and gone to heaven because I was about to speak to a man who had met Elvis’. But she says when he answered the door to his hotel room he was wearing his pyjamas, pinned her against a wall and then raped her. The BBC said they had no record of any written allegations about Sir Jimmy Savile's misconduct . KATRINA ROSE . Katrina Rose, now 51, said she was attacked in Savile's flat aged 14. BEBE ROBERTS . Bebe Roberts, now 62, claimed the ‘sleazy’ presenter regularly sneaked into bedrooms and once assaulted her when she was 15. DEBORAH COGGER . Deborah . Cogger, a 52-year-old mother-of-two, claimed she was aged 14 when . Savile allegedly kissed and groped her at a residential school. DEE COLES . Dee Coles said she and her friend were forced to perform sex acts on Savile in a caravan on holiday in Jersey four decades ago. ‘FIONA’ Fiona was a pupil at Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines, Surrey, and claimed she was abused aged 14. ‘JILL’ The 61-year-old former model claimed Savile molested her in his caravan when she was aged 20. ‘CHARLOTTE’ Charlotte was also at Duncroft and claimed she was sexually assaulted by Savile in 1974 in a caravan on the school grounds aged 14.

And they will . be quizzed about their decision to recruit Andy Coulson, the former News . of the World editor, as No 10 communications director after he had . resigned from the paper over the phone-hacking scandal. Senior . sources say the Prime Minister will fire a warning shot at Lord Justice . Leveson on Thursday, making clear that the Government will not adopt . new plans for regulating the Press that stifle freedom of speech. The sources have told the Daily Mail he will emulate Education Secretary Michael Gove by ‘putting down a marker’ that Press freedom must be preserved at all costs. Lord Justice Leveson has spoken of his desire for his recommendations on Press regulation to be backed by all political parties. But some Tories are concerned the Government will not be able to support his proposals if they go too far. One source said Mr Cameron’s message will be ‘Gove-lite’. ‘The starting point has to be that what comes next does not inhibit the freedom of the Press. ‘This is Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry but David will put down a marker about where he stands.’ Revealed: Leveson has shown how close Mr Cameron was to Rebekah Brooks and other senior NI figures . Mr Osborne will be asked about his contacts with Mr Hunt on the day the Culture Secretary took over responsibility for ruling on the  BSkyB bid from Vince Cable, whose hostility to the Murdochs had been exposed. Mr Hunt texted the Chancellor to say he was ‘seriously worried we are going to screw this up’. Mr Osborne replied: ‘I hope you like the solution!’ – a reference to Mr Hunt’s appointment to oversee the deal. Mr Brown, making his first major public appearance in a year on Monday, will face questions about claims by Rupert Murdoch that he threatened to ‘destroy’ his media empire after The Sun newspaper switched allegiance to the Tories. GORDON BROWN . Mr Brown is likely to give his version of the incident in which he is . said to have told Rupert Murdoch he had declared war on his media empire . after The Sun switched its support to the Conservatives in September . 2009. Mr Murdoch told the inquiry in April that Mr Brown had rung him . in an 'unbalanced' state of mind. The billionaire businessman said his 'warm personal relationship' with Mr Brown broke down after this. The former premier might also discuss The Sun's 2006 story about his son Fraser having cystic fibrosis. GEORGE OSBORNE . Mr Osborne will be asked about his role in the appointment of Andy Coulson and could also be questioned over any role . he had in the BSkyB saga after it emerged during Mr Hunt's evidence . that, after expressing his concerns, the Culture Secretary had been . texted by the Chancellor on the subject. Less than an hour before . responsibility for the bid was transferred to Mr Hunt from Vince Cable, Mr Osborne sent . him a message saying: 'I hope you like the solution.' SIR JOHN MAJOR . Former . Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie recalled one conversation with the . then-prime minister, on the night the UK crashed out of the European . Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992. Mr . MacKenzie said he told Sir John: 'I've got a bucket of s*** on my desk, . prime minister, and I'm going to pour it all over you,' when the . then-leader asked how the story was going to be covered in the paper the . next day. Senior Labour figures are worried that Mr Miliband, who gives evidence on Tuesday, will be quizzed about the behaviour of his chief spin-doctor Tom Baldwin. Mr Baldwin, a former journalist for the Murdoch-owned Times, wrote a memo urging Shadow Cabinet members to go soft on criticism of News Corporation. Mr Brown and Mr Osborne will appear on Monday, Sir John, Mr Miliband and . Ms Harman on Tuesday and Mr Clegg and Scottish First minister Alex Salmond on Wednesday. But it is the Prime Minister's evidence that is likely to take centre stage. His friendship with former newspaper . boss Rebekah Brooks has been under scrutiny, after she said he texted . her regularly, often signed off his text messages to her with ‘LOL’, . which he wrongly believed stood for ‘lots of love’. Mr . Cameron has also been forced to confess that he rode her horse Raisa . with Mrs Brooks’s husband Charlie, which was lent to her by the Met . between 2008 and 2010. It even came out he went to her house for . Christmas dinner. Also, he was dragged last month into . Jeremy Hunt's handling of the BSkyB takeover bid after it was revealed . the Culture Secretary privately urged David Cameron to back Rupert . Murdoch’s offer just weeks before the Prime Minister put him in charge . of ruling on the issue. In . a bombshell email, the Culture Secretary lavished praise on the £8 . billion bid and Mr Cameron then put him in charge of the quasi-judicial . decision. Mr Cameron . judged afterwards that the Culture Secretary had acted 'properly' throughout the period when he was responsible for the bid and decided . not to order an investigation into whether he had breached the . ministerial code of conduct. Mr . Hunt also insisted there was no reason for him to quit - though he . admitted in his evidence that he had considered resigning during his . six-hour grilling a week ago. Embarrassingly Downing Street was . also forced to apply for core participant status in an emergency hearing . last month, allowing them to  inspect any relevant text messages or . emails which have been submitted to the inquiry by other witnesses . before giving evidence themselves. Critics said it was a sign they were unprepared for the controversy that Leveson would cause for them.","Nick Clegg, George Osborne, Ed Miliband and Gordon Brown will also take the stand next week, it was announced today .

David Cameron and Nick Clegg rounded on critics of the Coalition yesterday as they insisted it had achieved more in two years than majority Conservative or Labour governments. Pointing to radical reform of welfare and education, as well as the reduction of Britain's vast deficit by a quarter, the two leaders said they were 'more committed'to coalition now than they were in May 2010. Seeking to draw a line under the Government's most turbulent period, following last week's bitter row over reform of the House of Lords, the pair denied they were a 'warring couple'. Scroll down for video . Positive spin: David Cameron and Nick Clegg rounded on critics of the Coalition yesterday as they insisted it had achieved more in two years than majority Conservative or Labour governments . The public’s opinion of the Conservatives has slumped dramatically since the Budget in March, according to a poll released today. For the first time since the creation of the Coalition, Labour has overhauled the Tories as the party rated most competent and capable by voters, the survey by Populus found. The proportion who think of the Conservatives as ‘competent and capable’ fell by 12 percentage points from 46 per cent in March to 34 per cent now, leaving them two behind Labour on 36 per cent (down one point since March). The Lib Dems were on 24 per cent (down six points). On party unity, the Tories fell from 42 per cent in March to 28 per cent now, equal with the Lib Dems (down one point), with Labour unchanged on 46 per cent. They announced plans for a new, slimmed-down Coalition agreement in the autumn. The Prime Minister dismissed Tory MPs who have suggested the party would be better off governing as a minority administration without the Lib Dems – insisting that with no Commons majority, it would not be able to carry legislation. He said: 'In a world of uncertain markets does anyone think we would be better off with a minority government that couldn't carry its legislation, that couldn't make rapid decisions? 'I am even more committed to coalition government today than I was in May 2010 when Nick Clegg and I formed this Government. It has real purpose, a real mission.' The Prime Minister added: 'My argument is actually we have taken on challenges that often single-party governments have found impossible,'highlighting reforms to cut the cost of public sector pensions by 40 per cent despite fierce trade union opposition. 'That's something Labour didn't achieve in 13 years and the Tories didn't achieve in 17 years,'he insisted. Controversial tuition fee reforms, Mr Cameron said, were another example of the coalition taking bolder steps in two years than the previous Tory or Labour governments. Working relationship: The Prime Minister dismissed Tory MPs who have suggested the party would be better off governing as a minority administration without the Lib Dems . He suggested the Coalition compared favourably with the administrations of Tony Blair, John Major and even Margaret Thatcher. Mr Clegg, for his part, poured scorn on those who were 'losing their nerve'almost half-way through the five-year Parliament. The Deputy Prime Minister brushed aside last week's turmoil over his plans to replace the House of Lords with a mainly elected second chamber – 91 Tory MPs voted with Labour to wreck Government legislation. 'You always get a bump in the road like we did last week in the Westminster village on Lords reform,'he said. In a reference to his first appearance with Mr Cameron, in the garden of Number Ten, Mr Clegg added: 'It is tough to be in government in difficult times, it is not always a walk in the park or in the rose garden.  None of that will stop us from continuing to govern in the national interest for the whole country. 'We need to put short-term popularity to one side and get on with making the big long-term reforms and changes this country so desperately needs.' Appearing together at a railway depot at Smethwick, near Birmingham, as the Cabinet met to announce a £9billion investment in the rail network, the two men announced plans for a mid-term review of the coalition to be published in the autumn. Further announcements on . infrastructure spending are due later this week, with the Treasury . expected to outline plans for the state to underwrite new housing . developments tomorrow. A full-scale Coalition agreement 'part two'which was once mooted, however, has been scaled back. Harking back: In a reference to his first appearance with Mr Cameron, in the garden of Number Ten, pictured, Mr Clegg said 'It is tough to be in government in difficult times' Mr Cameron said a 'slimmed down'document would 'look back at what we have achieved and what we have still left to do'. Asked what the odds were of the Coalition surviving until the 2015 election, Mr Cameron said: 'I am not a bookmaker, I am not a betting man, but I wouldn't bet against it.' Mr Clegg added: 'I would bet a considerable amount of money on us staying together.' Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who resigned as a ministerial aide over Europe, said if the Lib Dems went through with threats to kill off changes to Commons constituency boundaries unless Conservative MPs agreed to Lords reform, then Mr Cameron should pull out of the Coalition. But former Lib Dem Cabinet minister David Laws, one of Mr Clegg's closest allies, said: 'It's very, very, very unlikely that we're going to see the two parties split before the end of their full five-year Parliament.'","The pair pointed to radical reform of welfare and education, as well as the reduction of Britain's vast deficit .

"By . Simon Walters . PUBLISHED: . 17:06 EST, 22 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:26 EST, 23 September 2012 . Foul-mouthed Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell should be sacked for insulting police officers who made him get off his bicycle at the gates to Downing Street, according to a Mail on Sunday poll.Two in three believe the Chief Whip should be forced to quit, with barely one in five backing his fight to hang on to his job. Calls for sacking: Many have called for Andrew Mitchell to go after his 'foul mouthed rant' Even Conservative voters have turned on him – more than half say he should go, with fewer than one in three backing him. Mr Mitchell stayed tight-lipped yesterday as the furore continued over claims that he called police ‘morons’ and ‘f*****g plebs’ in a petulant outburst. Tory MPs and senior Whitehall officials said he would be lucky to survive, while others gave additional alleged examples of the former Rugby School pupil’s high-handed manner. According to civil servants at the Department for International  Development – run by Mr Mitchell, 56, until the Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month – his insistence on receiving VIP treatment while  on foreign trips with his special adviser Philippa Buckley, sometimes backfired. ‘He liked to be the last passenger on board the plane, presumably so he didn’t have to get on with the plebs,’ said one. ‘Airline staff would get fed up with it and on at least one occasion he missed the plane as a result. They shut the gate and wouldn’t let him on. He was furious and had to get another flight.’ One Tory MP said he had been the victim of another four-letter tirade by Mr Mitchell. He recalled: ‘I was an aspiring MP and had committed a minor indiscretion that Mitchell took exception to. ‘He told me, “While I have a single f*****g breath in my body I will make sure you never become an MP.”  The man is an appalling bully. I can see why he was known as Thrasher at Rugby.’ Friends of the Prime Minister say they warned him against promoting Mr Mitchell to Chief Whip because of his reputation for politically incorrect tantrums. David Cameron and Mr Mitchell fell out when the allies of Mr Mitchell made allegations of a dirty-tricks campaign when they were both rivals seeking their first Parliamentary seat. Relations between the two deteriorated further when Mr Mitchell ran David Davis’s unsuccessful bid to beat Mr Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. It was only after Mr Mitchell’s ally George Osborne intervened on his behalf that a wary Mr Cameron gave Mr Mitchell a second chance. Mr Mitchell then promptly fell out with Mr Davis. A senior Minister said: ‘Andrew got back in with Cameron by crawling. Whenever he is within ten yards of the PM you can hear the sound  of slurping.’ One MP who criticised the Prime Minister in front of Mr Mitchell was surprised by his response. ‘He said, “Whenever my local activists complain about Cameron I tell them don’t blame me, I ran David Davis’s campaign.” I am not sure if he was joking.’ Hanging on: Andrew Mitchell on his bicycle at the gates to Downing Street . Mr Mitchell’s supporters freely admit that he can be volatile, but say he is ‘misunderstood’. One said: ‘For 99 per cent of the time he is charm personified – you have to ignore the bluster.’ Mr Mitchell is hoping that the  tradition whereby the Chief Whip does not speak in public will help him to survive this storm. It means he is less likely to be  challenged to account for his verbal onslaught against the police.One rebel Tory claimed Mr Mitchell was now ‘neutered’ as Chief Whip. ‘He can no longer enforce party discipline,’ said the MP. ‘If he calls me in to discipline me, I will say, “You insulted a policeman, that’s worse than anything I have done, so back off.” ’ Conservative MP Peter Bone said ‘stupid’ Mr Mitchell should resign if he had made the remarks attributed to him, adding: ‘It defies belief that anyone could swear at a police officer – especially one who was  in Downing Street to protect the Prime Minister.’ Fellow Tory MP Brian Binley said: ‘Andrew Mitchell’s actions strengthen the impression that those at the top of the party are a bunch of elitists who think they are better than others.’ VIDEO: Shadow Police Minister calls on the PM to find out what really happened...","Senior Whitehall officials say he will be 'lucky to survive'

"By . Matt Chorley and Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 17:52 EST, 21 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:29 EST, 23 October 2012 . Split: Andrew Mitchell resigned last week after a month of controversy . The Prime Minister was forced to defend his handling of the Andrew Mitchell affair yesterday, insisting the former Chief Whip’s rant at Downing Street police was not serious enough to cost him his job. The Prime Minister said Mr Mitchell finally resigned because of the ‘bigger question’ of whether he would be able to do his job properly, having had his  authority over MPs undermined. Mr Cameron – widely criticised for allowing the issue to drag on for a month – appeared irritated as he was questioned over his refusal to sack the minister in a series of TV interviews yesterday. Mr Mitchell has denied police claims he called officers ‘plebs’ and ‘morons’ after they asked him to use a side entrance to Number Ten, rather than opening the main gate for him and his bicycle. But he admitted swearing during the altercation and finally quit on Friday night after senior colleagues told him and the Prime Minister he could not continue. Mr Cameron, speaking on ITV’s The Agenda programme last night, said: ‘The decision I had to make right at the beginning was: Was it right for him to apologise and did the police accept that apology and therefore could he get on and do his job? I took that decision. Some people would criticise that and say, “Why not just sack him straight away?” I don’t think that would have been the right thing to do. But obviously we found after a period of time he couldn’t do his job so he had to resign.’ He added: ‘I think as PM you’ve got to ... if someone has apologised you need to give them a chance to do their job. I tried, whether it was Liam Fox’s resignation, I tried ... rather than just do the easy thing quick at the lobby meeting at 11 o’clock meeting and have the person out the door which Tony Blair sometimes did.’ ‘It's the easiest thing in the world as Prime Minister to just sack someone at the drop of a hat when something goes wrong. I thought the right thing to do was to make sure there was a proper apology,’ he said. ‘The police didn't want to take it further but it did become apparent he wasn't going to be able to do his job so the right conclusion was reached. ‘It takes longer to discover whether someone can or can't do their job. It's much easier just to fire people, I actually think that is not the right approach.’ Yesterday Education Secretary Michael Gove revealed Mr Cameron did not believe Mr Mitchell should have lost his job because of ‘seven seconds of madness’ in Downing Street. The revelation raised fresh questions about Mr Cameron’s judgment among Tory MPs – who are still reeling from Mr Mitchell’s dramatic resignation after four weeks of controversy about his foul-mouthed rant at police officers. Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, claimed the PM had not learned any lessons from 'this shambles'. He added: 'While everyone else can see how wrong Andrew Mitchell was, the Prime Minister is still completely out of touch.  David Cameron should stop trying to blame other people for his own weakness and dithering - and start taking some responsibility.' Mr Gove risked reopening the row with the Police Federation, by suggesting that the officers’ recollection of former Chief Whip Mr Mitchell’s rant may have been wrong. He said: ‘There’s a Japanese film, I think it’s called Rashomon, in which different participants who see the same event all have different recollections of it. I wasn’t there. I trust Andrew, and I’m always inclined to give him the benefit of any doubt.’ One Tory MP said yesterday he was ‘staggered’ that Mr Mitchell had not been sacked as soon as news broke of his confrontation. Another said the Prime Minister had been ‘misguided’, while a third accused him of presiding over a ‘catastrophe’ that would do lasting damage to the party’s image. In a further blow, former Conservative Party chairman Lord Tebbit accused Mr Cameron of leading a ‘dog of a coalition government’ that had let itself be portrayed as ‘a government of unfeeling toffs’. Mr Mitchell finally quit the Cabinet on Friday night, saying he had lost the backing of the Parliamentary party. Scroll down for video . Opposed: David Cameron does not believe Andrew Mitchell should have lost his job because of ‘seven seconds of madness’ in Downing Street, Michael Gove (right) revealed last night . Senior ministers, including Home Secretary Theresa May, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Mr Mitchell’s own deputy John Randall, were among those who told him he should go for the good of the party. Mrs May made no attempt to deny her role yesterday, telling the BBC: ‘I’m not going to talk about private conversations. Andrew has resigned. I think that is an end to the issue.’ Accepting Mr Mitchell’s resignation on Friday, Mr Cameron hinted at a possible comeback. And Mr Gove revealed that the Prime Minister still believed Mr Mitchell should be in the Cabinet. Home Secretary Theresa May told Mr Mitchell he should resign . He told Sky News: ‘David Cameron wanted to keep Andrew, I wanted Andrew to stay because I don’t believe and the Prime Minister doesn’t believe that 30 years of public service should be effaced at a stroke by seven seconds of unacceptable but very human exasperation. ‘But Andrew came to that decision and he did so because he wanted to put the interests of the party collectively ahead of his own.’ Mr Gove repeated the claim in a later interview, saying the Prime Minister had ‘wanted him to stay on’. He acknowledged that the row had overshadowed good news on the economy last week, but said the public would see through the ‘froth’, noting that Tony Blair had won three elections despite a string of scandals involving ministers in his government. Mr Gove’s comments came as backbenchers broke cover to voice their dismay at the Prime Minister’s handling of recent events. Tory MP Andrew Percy said he had told his whip as soon as the original story broke that Mr Mitchell ought to be removed because it would ‘run and run and run’. ‘I was frankly a bit staggered at the time that Downing Street hadn’t picked up on the whole mess earlier,’ he said. Mr Percy added: ‘A lot of the problems we are facing at the moment are not problems about the economy but actually it’s stuff we have made ourselves. The disasters or shambles that are created wholly within Westminster or within Downing Street.’ Brian Binley, secretary of the backbench 1922 Committee, described Mr Cameron’s decision to bring back Old Etonian Sir George Young to replace Mr Mitchell as a ‘comfort-zone appointment’. He added: ‘I’m afraid it points to very poor man-management – David is the sort of guy who wants people around him who is comfortable with rather than people who will challenge him.’ MP Philip Davies said Mr Cameron had been ‘misguided’ to hang on to Mr Mitchell, adding: ‘It was handled badly. Andrew Mitchell should have resigned, I think when he didn’t resign the Prime Minister should have sacked him.’ In an article for the Observer, Lord Tebbit wrote: ‘This dog of a coalition government has let itself be given a bad name and now anybody can beat it. ‘It has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs. Past governments have had far more real Tory toffs: prime ministers Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Macmillan, or even in Thatcher’s day, Whitelaw, Soames, Hailsham, Carrington, Gowrie, Joseph, Avon, Trenchard and plenty more, without incurring similar abuse.’","The Prime Minister says it would have been 'easy' to sack his minister but the 'proper thing to do' was get him to say sorry .

A Colombian prostitute at the centre . of the ongoing Secret Service sex scandal has broken her silence. Speaking about the tawdry . episode that has seen three agents ousted from their posts after a . wild night of partying in Cartagena last week, a 24-year-old high-end escort claims . she was offered $30 - a fraction of her $800 fee - for a night with one of the men. 'I tell him, 'Baby, my cash money,' she recalled in an interview with The New York Times, recounting a heated exchange that has wrecked the agency's . reputation and become an election year embarrassment for President . Barack Obama. Embarrassment: U.S. President Barack Obama walks across the South Lawn of the White House, behind a Secret Service agent, in Washington DC, on Wednesday . Seedy: The PleyClub, in Cartagena, Colombia, where Obama's Secret Service agents allegedly picked up prostitutes . The news came today as the Secret . Service says three employees have been ousted in the wake of questionable behaviour at the Hotel Caribe last week, with some now under investigation for possible drug use, ABC . News reports. New details of the sordid night . emerged Wednesday as a single mother and self-described prostitute told . The New York Times that she met an agent at a discotheque, believed to be the PleyClub, in Cartagena . and after a night of drinking. 'They never told me they were with Obama,' she said, calling the men 'very discreet'. The woman, who chose to remain . anonymous, said she and one of the agents agreed the agent would pay her . $800 for sex at the hotel. The next morning, when the hotel's front desk called because the woman hadn't left, the pair argued over the price. 'Embarassed': Leon Panetta, left, and General Martin Dempsey, right, have promised to investigate the military's role in the scandal . In an interview in Colombia, she said . the two argued after the agent initially offered to pay her about $30 . and the situation escalated, eventually ending with Colombian law . enforcement involved. She said she was eventually paid about $225. Days later, she said a friend told her the argument had made the news, and to her shock, she discovered the man was a Secret Service agent. 'I'm scared,' she said, adding that she did not want the man in question to be reprimanded, and fears retaliation, the Times reports. 'This is something really big,' she added. 'This is the government of the United States. I have nervous . attacks. I cry all the time' Eleven Secret Service agents were . eventually sent home from the colonial-era city of Cartagena on . Colombia's Caribbean coast after a wild night of partying that saw many . of the agents bring escorts back to their rooms, according to reports. Provocative: The PleyClub website promises to turn your fantasies into reality . Gated: A high fence and locking gate surround the entrance to the club . Special agents and uniformed officers . were stationed in Cartagena in advance of President Barack Obama's . arrival for the Summit of the Americas. The incident occurred before . Obama arrived and was at a different hotel than the president stayed in. In the first casualties claimed in . wake of the incident, the Secret Service announced today three agents . are leaving the service, even as separate U.S. government investigations . are under way. The Secret Service did not identify . the three agents leaving the government or eight more it said remain on . administrative leave. In a statement, it said one supervisor was allowed . to retire and another will be fired for cause. A third employee, who . was not a supervisor, has resigned. The agents were implicated in the . prostitution scandal in Colombia that also involved about 10 military . service members and as many as 20 women. All the Secret Service . employees who were involved had their security clearances revoked. Performance space: Cheap tables and seats are packed around a stage, which is completed with two dancing poles . Dingy: This strip club is a distant image from the upmarket Hotel Caribe where the agents where staying . 'These are the first steps,' said . Representative Pete King, R-New York, chairman of the House Homeland . Security Committee, which oversees the Secret Service. King said the . agency's director, Mark Sullivan, took employment action against 'the . three people he believes the case was clearest against.' But King . warned: 'It's certainly not over.' News . that 11 Secret Service agents had been sent home after 'nearly all of . them' were caught with prostitutes all but overshadowed President Barack . Obama's trip to Colombia this weekend. The . scandal unfolded rapidly after a tipster called the Associated Press . and reported the incident Wednesday night at the luxurious Hotel Caribe . in Cartagena, where the agents were staying while the conducted advance . security operations to prepare for the president's arrival. The agents allegedly picked up the hookers at the seedy PleyClub after a night of heavy drinking and hard-partying there. They were busted after a prostitute . got angry and caused a commotion involving hotel security and local . police when one agent refused to pay her. The tab? $47. Two of the men were supervisors. Several are married and all of them have been suspended, pending an investigation. Experts say the scandal could have exposed the agents to blackmail and potentially endangered the president. President . Obama, whom the Secret Service claims was never in danger, said he . would be 'angry' if the allegations are proven true. Rep . Darrell Issa, a California Republican, suggested Secret Service agents . might be covering up other sex scandals when he said, 'Things like this don't happen once if they didn't happen before.' King said the agent set to be fired . would sue. King said Sullivan had to follow collective bargaining rules . but was 'moving as quickly as he can. Once he feels the facts are clear, . he's going to move.' In Washington and Colombia, separate . U.S. government investigations were already under way. King said he has . assigned four congressional investigators to the probe. The House . Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, led by Rep. Darrell Issa, . R-California, sought details of the Secret Service investigation, . including the disciplinary histories of the agents involved. Secret . Service investigators are in Colombia interviewing witnesses. In a letter to Sullivan, Issa and . Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee's ranking . Democrat, said the agents 'brought foreign nationals in contact with . sensitive security information.' A potential security breach has been . among the concerns raised by members of Congress. The episode took a sharp political . turn when presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said . he would fire the agents involved. Romney told radio host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday that 'I'd clean house' at the Secret Service. 'The right thing to do is to remove . people who have violated the public trust and have put their play time . and their personal interests ahead of the interests of the nation,' Romney said. While Romney suggested to Ingraham . that a leadership problem led to the scandal, he told a Columbus, Ohio, . radio station earlier that he has confidence in Sullivan, the head of . the agency. 'I believe the right corrective action . will be taken there and obviously everyone is very, very disappointed,' Romney said. 'I think it will be dealt with (in) as aggressive a way as . is possible given the requirements of the law.' When asked, the Romney campaign would . not say whether he had been briefed on the situation or was relying upon . media reports for details. Luxury accommodations: The agents were partying at the Hotel Caribe, a beachfront resort, where they were staying while they scouted security for Obama's visit . Nice digs: Several White House staffers and reporters traveling with the president stayed at the hotel. The president, however, stayed elsewhere . At least 10 military personnel who were staying at the same hotel are also being investigated for misconduct. Two U.S. military officials have said . they include five Army Green Berets. One of the officials said the group . also includes two Navy Explosive Ordinance Disposal technicians, two . Marine dog handlers and an Air Force airman. The officials spoke on . condition of anonymity because the investigation is still under way. Secret Service's Office of . Professional Responsibility, which handles that agency's internal . affairs, is investigating, and the Homeland Security Department's . inspector general also has been notified. Sullivan, who this week has briefed . lawmakers behind closed doors, said he has referred to the case to an . independent government investigator.

Soothing: The sound of music can make a newborn sleep better and puts them in a quietly attentive state . Playing live music to a prematurely born baby can slow its heartbeat and make the child breathe more easily, according to a new study. The sound of an instrument or parent singing can make a newborn sleep better and puts them in a quietly attentive state. In some cases it also improves sucking behaviours which are important to help them feed. The researchers found the effect was true regardless of which song was played, although the tracks had to be slowed down so that they sounded like a lullaby. The study adds to the growing body of evidence that music can benefit newborn children. Doctors . in the US have reported that it is as effective - not to mention safer - . than using sedatives before giving them heart or brain scans. The new research was coordinated by Beth Israel Hospital in New York across 11 American hospitals. Music . therapists worked with the mothers of 272 premature babies for several . sessions over two weeks using either two instruments, singing or no . music. The instruments used . were a ‘gato box’, which is a wooden drum, and an ‘ocean disc’ which is a . cylinder full of beads which was used to make whooshing noises. Among the songs chosen were ‘I heard it through the Grapevine’ by Marvin Gaye and ‘Pick up the Pieces’ by Average White Band’. Fighting chance: In Britain a premature baby is categorised as one that is born less than 37 weeks into the pregnancy . Both . were slowed down so they were softer on the ear. If no song was chosen . then the researchers chose the nursery rhyme ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little . Star’. Joanne Loewy, the . study’s leader and the director of Beth Israel’s Louis Armstrong Centre . for Music and Medicine, said that all the instruments had a beneficial . effect. In Britain a premature baby is categorised as one that is born less than 37 weeks into the pregnancy. The . UK has the highest rate of premature births in Europe. Approximately . one in eight babies born in the UK every year are born prematurely or . becomes ill soon afterwards. Out of these 70,000 babies, around 18,000 need intensive care. Survival . rates have however improved and early 80 per cent of babies weighing . 2lb 2oz, or 'sugar bag babies' as they are sometimes known, are now . expected to live compared with 20 per cent in 1980. However sucking behaviour improved . most with the gato box. The breathing rate slowed the most and sleeping . was the best with the ocean disc. Singing was the most effective at slowing the baby’s heart rate and it also made the baby most attentive. Dr Loewy said babies who heard songs chosen by their parents as opposed to ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’ also had better feeding behaviour, but the nursery rhyme did lead to more oxygenation of the blood. In her report she said that one of the reasons the music may have been effective was that it mimicked the noises the baby heard when it was in the womb. Among those who took part in the study was new mother Andrea Zalkin who sang the Beatles hit ‘Eight Days a Week’ to her son Hudson, who was born 13 weeks early. The music therapist working with her changed it to a slow waltz and amended the lyrics so they included the words ‘Baby Hudson’ and the sound ‘ahh’. Miss Zalkin said that she saw that it ‘changes the way he’s breathing and I’m breathing, it changes his behaviour’. The new study was published in the journal Paediatrics.","New study claims music can puts newborns into a quietly attentive state .

Killer: Heather Butler who knocked Sam Brown, 15, off his bicycle and killed him in Eastrington, East Yorkshire . A drunk nurse mowed down a 15-year-old boy while driving to work and left him to die – but only after stopping to remove his damaged bicycle from the front of her car. Heather Butler, 67, was unsteady and slurring her words when she arrived for her shift at a nursing home and a breath-test showed she was two-and-a-half times the legal limit, a court heard. She was jailed for five years and four months at Hull Crown Court. Judge Mark Bury told her it ‘would have been obvious’ she had hit the boy and the tragedy was made worse because she was ‘going to work caring for people and possibly giving out medication’ while drunk. By coincidence Butler knew the victim’s mother because she worked at the same nursing home. Her Audi A4 car ploughed into schoolboy Sam Brown as he and a friend cycled home in the dark at 9pm without rear lights. Her windscreen was smashed and wing mirror removed. She stopped 200 metres on to remove the bike from her grille, threw it aside and continued to work less than a mile away without going back to treat Sam or his 15-year-old friend, who suffered a broken shoulder. Butler had drunk a glass of wine and ‘three home measures’ of gin and tonic before driving, the court heard. When she arrived at the Old School House Nursing Home in Gilberdyke, East Yorkshire, she was asked if she was alright and replied: ‘No, I think I hit a cyclist.’ Two colleagues went out in a car, found Sam and tried to help  motorists resuscitate him. He died of head injuries in hospital. The court heard Butler had been reported for being drunk at work in the past and ‘it was rare she did not smell of alcohol’. Motorist Nicholas Webb was behind Butler at the time of the crash on the B1230 on September 6 last year. He said she was ‘all over the road’ and ‘driving fast’, prompting him to drop back. She was speeding and a crash investigation found she did not brake or take evasive action. In a statement to police, Butler recalled ‘seeing a cyclist ahead of me, very close to me, and then I felt the impact at the front of my car.’ Victim: Sam Brown, 15, was thrown off his bicycle after being clipped by Butler's Audi A4 as he cycled with his friend . Victim: Sam Brown who died after being hit by Heather Butler's Audi A4 in Eastrington, East Yorkshire . She added: ‘Following the feeling I . pulled over and got out.

The loss is something I will feel for the rest of my life' Tracey Brown, mother of Sam Brown . ‘It never occurred to me to use my mobile phone.’ Butler, who is married and worked at . the nursing home for 18 years, admitted causing death by careless . driving while over the limit, failing to report an accident and failing . to stop. Paul Genney, defending, said she wanted to apologise. He said: ‘She is genuinely remorseful.’ Butler has resigned and is likely to . be struck off the nursing register. Butler was given a five-year . driving ban and ordered to take an extended re-test. She is likely to . serve only half of her prison term. Crash scene: Flowers are piled up in tribute to Sam Brown, 15, following the accident on the the B1230 Hull Road last September .

Franki Hackett of road safety charity Brake said: ‘It is appalling such a callous crime could lead to such a paltry sentence. ‘It makes a mockery of justice that someone could face less than three years in prison for taking a promising young life.’","Heather Butler drank three gin and tonics and wine before driving to work .

A  mother is furious after a judge ordered her 13-year-old daughter to cut off her ponytail in return for a lesser sentence after she attacked a toddler with scissors and hacked off chunks of her hair. Kaytlen Lopan and an 11-year-old friend launched their assault on the three-year-old at a McDonald’s restaurant in Price, Utah, buying a pair of scissors from a nearby dollar shop and chopping off her long curly locks. Kaytlen was ordered to serve 30 days in detention, pay damages to the victims and serve 276 hours of community service for her part in the attack, at a hearing on May 28. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Kaytlen Lopan's three-year-old victim, pictured, had never had her hair cut before the attack . But her mother, Valerie Bruno, took up a judge’s offer of reducing the sentence if she performed a similar hack job to her daughter’s hair. District Juvenile Judge Scott Johansen said he would drop the number of hours by 150 in exchange for the amateur haircut, the Deseret News reported. ‘If she was my daughter, I wouldn't want her with the work crew,’ he said, to which Ms Bruno replied: ‘I know, I thought of that.’ Mr Johansen gave Ms Bruno a pair of scissors and consulted the victim’s mother, Mindy Moss, about what length the girl’s hair should be taken to, eventually ordering Ms Bruno to cut it level with the hairband tying it up. He even gave her advice on the cut, suggesting that Ms Bruno ‘take a little bit at a time’ when she complained that the scissors weren’t good enough.

The time it takes to diagnose dementia is to be slashed from 18 months to just three following a scientific breakthrough. David Cameron will this week announce the creation of a chain of brain clinics to end the agony of those who find out they have Alzheimer’s when it is too late for help. Experts say early diagnosis will give those suffering from the early stages of dementia 18 months of extra independent living, transforming the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable and elderly. Needing treatment: Thousands of dementia sufferers go without care because their condition goes undiagnosed . More than 400,000 people in Britain are suffering from dementia but are denied the care and support they need because their condition is undiagnosed – in part because they have to wait a year and a half for it to be confirmed. But new technology, which will receive the Prime Minister’s backing this Thursday, will mean those suffering from memory loss or other potential symptoms will have their condition diagnosed in a sixth of the time. Vow: Prime Minister David Cameron had pledged to preserve pensioners' benefits for the lifetime of this parliament . Patients at risk will be able to do a series of tests on an iPad in the comfort of their local GP’s office. In only ten minutes the software can determine the difference between people with normal and abnormal memory. Those at risk would then be referred to an NHS brain health centre where they would have more extensive memory tests while hooked up to an MRI scanner. A new computer program can detect signs of dementia such as brain shrinkage and damage to blood vessels that can affect memory. The results would be beamed back to the GP. The Government is also investing in a . series of mobile diagnostic clinics which will park outside GP . surgeries, so people can be tested on their own doorstep. The rate of successful diagnosis is . expected to double from 42 per cent at present to 80 per cent – a target . set by Mr Cameron earlier this year when he launched a Challenge on . Dementia. The PM has pledged to launch a campaign against Alzheimer’s to match the war on Aids in the 1980s and 1990s. It is estimated that by 2020 there will be nearly one million people with dementia, rising from the current level of 670,000. Mr Cameron said last night: ‘Dementia is a devastating disease that puts enormous strain on people and their families. Early intervention: Six out of ten people living with dementia in the UK currently have not received a diagnosis, research found. (Posed by model) ‘Prompt . diagnosis makes an enormous difference to dementia sufferers. This . ground-breaking work from UK scientists and companies could change lives . for the better and it underlines to the world that Britain is great for . research and for business.’ The . Government is investing £39million in the pilot project via a fund . called Biomedical Catalyst that backs small and medium-sized businesses . and universities to accelerate the development of most . technologically-advanced healthcare. The first ‘Brain Health Centre’ will . be established at the Memory Clinic at Maudsley Hospital in South . London. The mobile van will run trials in Sussex. If they are a success . they will be rolled out nationwide. The . Alzheimer’s Society will support the project by ensuring the needs of . patients and their carers are fully considered in the project, and by . undertaking an initial impact assessment on the 200 patients assessed in . the two trial Brain Health Centres. Six . out of ten people living with dementia in the UK have not received a . diagnosis. Experts say the problem is that many people have never raised . the problem with their GP, or may have been misdiagnosed, or are simply . waiting for a diagnosis. The current way a patient is diagnosed with dementia is both unwieldy and lengthy. In fact, there is no set referral pathway for those who complain about memory problems to their GP. A doctor may ask the patient to come back in a few months, may put the problem down to old age, or may conduct a basic pencil and paper memory test. Eventually a patient may be referred to a memory clinic, where other GPs will identify whether a problem exists. At that point the patient may be diagnosed, may be sent for a brain scan, or may be referred to a psychiatrist or neurologist in a regional centre. Guidelines mean patients should not wait more than 18 weeks for an appointment with a specialist, but high demand means it often takes much longer. Once they have an appointment at a hospital – usually in a major city or specialist hospital – they could have to travel long distances to get there. Usually the patient will then be given a memory test, and may, but not always, have an MRI or CT scan. The test is assessed by a neurologist or a psychiatrist. Any brain scans are assessed by a radiologist, who uses their expertise to judge whether there is a problem. At that point the patient may get a diagnosis. The whole process from start to finish can take up to 18 months. Under the proposed system, any patient with memory problems will be given a ten-minute test by a GP, using newly developed software on an iPad. It will immediately identify whether a patient is at risk of dementia. They hope the proposed system will make diagnoses quicker and more accurate – and the ease and access to scanners will mean people are not put off seeking help. The Alzheimer’s Disease International . charity says earlier diagnosis allows those with dementia to plan ahead . while they still have the capacity, and crucially, make decisions about . their own care. Early . interventions can also allow doctors to improve cognitive function, . treat depression and delay institutionalisation – giving a patient more . time to live independently. High . blood pressure and a lack of exercise have also been linked to the . onset of the dementia, and researchers are investigating whether early . changes to lifestyle may slow the progression of the disease. Jeremy . Hughes, chief executive at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘There are . 800,000 people living with dementia in the UK, but fewer than half of . people with the condition have a diagnosis. As numbers double and costs . soar, developing new and earlier ways of diagnosing the condition is . imperative. ‘This . technology could potentially reduce the time people need to wait for a . diagnosis significantly. After diagnosis, we also need to ensure that . people are supported with information and services to enable them to . gain the full benefits and support that a diagnosis can give.’ Professor Alistair Burns, the national . clinical director for dementia, said: ‘Combining innovative . technologies in this way should help us to spot early signs of dementia, . giving us time to offer patients better support and care.’ The . project is being run by the companies IXICO and Cambridge Cognition, . which developed the iPad software, in partnership with King’s College . London, the Universities of Brighton and Sussex and Imperial College London.","More than 400,000 people in Britain are suffering from dementia .

Seek and destroy: The lethal Predator drone is 27ft long and comes armed with Hellfire missiles . Drones are used for lethal and non-lethal purposes: they can track drug smugglers, monitor borders and search for earthquake victims, and environmentalists use them to catch illegal whalers and loggers. But the driving force behind the most sophisticated drones remains the military, who use them for spying and killing. Their proliferation has led to thousands of deaths, the disruption of entire communities and increased political instability. The US example of sending drones wherever it wants and killing whoever it wants on the basis of secret information is leading to a world of lawlessness. Innocent lives are snuffed out without . a trace of accountability. Drones don’t give their targets a chance to . surrender. They simply pulverise them. This technology extends god-like powers to democratically elected leaders – and potentially to dictators and terrorists. Those . with armed drones include the US, UK, Israel, Iran and China. Some 76 . countries all told have drones, with many in the process of weaponising . them. Iran is supplying . drones to Hezbollah in Lebanon; South Africa is selling lethal drones . to Saudi Arabia; Israel is  selling drones all over Africa  and Latin . America. The global drones arms race, spurred on by the US, is in full cry. And there are terrifying reasons why we should think very carefully about a world left to their unblinking mercy . Technology: The Predator's infrared camera can identify a human from 10,000ft in the air . Following the 9/11 attacks on New York in 2001, the US military filled its shopping trolleys with every robot it could find: tiny ones that climb walls and stairs, snake-like ones that slither, and robots to carry soldiers’ heavy loads. They also snatched up every type of drone on the production line and commissioned new ones. They bought the 38in-long Raven which fits in a rucksack and can be launched by throwing it into the air. They invested in the 27ft-long Predator with its Hellfire missiles, and later the more powerful Reaper version. The Predator’s infrared camera can identify the heat of a human from 10,000ft in the air, so from 8,000 miles away in Nevada a drone ‘pilot’ or operator can watch an Afghan as he lights a cigarette or talks to friends. Then the US bought the 40ft-long Global Hawk with its long-range surveillance capability of 40,000 square miles a day. Drones can fly low and slow over hostile terrain, and hover for hours, or all day if need be. The Reaper can linger in the air for about 18 hours. Others have an endurance of weeks. Then there is the Vulture. Solar panels cover its massive 400ft wingspan and enable it to stay in the air for up to five years. Boeing has already produced a prototype for its Phantom Ray drone, roughly the size of a fighter jet, which flies itself. Powerful: The Reaper model can ling in the air for about 18 hours but others have an endurance of weeks . Lockheed’s drones include the RQ-170 Sentinel, better known as the Beast of Kandahar, which has a wingspan of roughly 40ft and is said to have provided surveillance for the operation to execute Osama Bin Laden. In 2000, the Pentagon had fewer than 50 drones. A decade later, that number had soared to nearly 7,500. Most were used for surveillance, but the number of weapons strikes kept increasing, from 74 in 2007 to 839 by 2012. The RAF has been piloting Reaper drones from Creech Air Force Base in Nevada since late 2007, and they will soon be flown remotely by pilots at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. The most extensive drone programme outside a war zone is run by the CIA. Between 2004 and 2012, it conducted more than 350 drone strikes in Pakistan, with a spike of 118 attacks in 2010, killing somewhere between 2,600 and 3,400 people. Local councils, police and security agencies, private companies and even our neighbours will soon be able to pilot drones over our homes. A former Second World War  airfield in Aberporth in Wales is being used as a centre for testing military and civilian drones, including the Watchkeeper surveillance aircraft. Four police forces have tried them out, and they are used regularly for surveying crops and in the offshore oil industry. In war zones, It has been claimed that of more than 600 Hellfire missiles fired by Predator drones, 95 per cent hit their targets, with failures attributed to mechanical fault or a target moving at the last instant. But some question this. In July 2011, British drone operators made a mistake that killed four civilians in Afghanistan with missiles fired from Reaper drones piloted out of Nevada. Even when they do hit their target, there is no guarantee that the victim really is a terrorist and apparently no way of avoiding ‘collateral’ damage. Also undermining communities is the horrendous US practice of striking one area multiple times, a tactic known as ‘double taps’. With rescuers having been killed for their efforts, people are now afraid to assist the injured. Drone attacks are stoking an endless fire of violence and revenge.","Global drones arms race, spurred by the US, is in full cry .

The rise is fuelled by the removal a year ago of a cap that stopped postmen delivering more than three unaddressed letters to a house in a week. This – along with much higher stamp prices – saw Royal Mail report vastly improved operating profits yesterday. Clyde Loakes, of the Local Government Association, said junk mail was a menace. ‘The LGA has previously raised concerns about the impact of Royal Mail scrapping its limit on unsolicited mail,’ he said. ‘The revelation that half of the postbag is now direct marketing material proves those concerns were not ill founded . ‘Most people don’t appreciate being bombarded with junk mail on a daily basis. Not only is it a nuisance to have to pick up and throw away, but it adds thousands of tons to the amount of waste councils have to collect.’ Robert Hammond, of the campaign group Consumer Focus, said: ‘Some consumers may find it frustrating that almost half of mail  received now is direct marketing and that this will be contributing to higher profits. ‘However, the hard fact is that without this revenue stream for Royal Mail and the associated profits, customers could in fact face paying more for their stamps.’ Royal Mail made £144million in the first half of the year compared with only £12million in the same period of 2011. Around £1billion of its annual revenues come from junk mail. Moya Greene, Royal Mail’s £1.1million-a-year chief executive, said such ‘direct marketing’ was approaching 50 per cent of all deliveries. Royal Mail admitted the volume of unwanted letters will only grow in its drive to make bigger profits . She described herself as a huge fan of the ‘powerful medium’, adding: ‘We are poised to increase our share of it.’ In July, Royal Mail launched Market Reach, which is a one-stop shop for firms that want to use junk mail. Miss Greene said the service would design postal messages, identify potential addresses, carry out deliveries and deal with responses from customers. Between March 26 and September 23, Royal Mail delivered a record-breaking 1.6billion items of unsolicited mail to Britain’s 29million addresses. Junk mail can be reduced by registering with The Mailing Preference Service. It is free and allows householders to remove their names and addresses from many marketing lists. You can register on the website www.mpsonline.org.uk or by calling 0845 703 4599. Read more: How to reduce your junk mail . It also delivered 6.8billion addressed letters – some of which would be junk mail. The growing profitability of Royal Mail opens up the possibility of it being floated on the stock market or sold off to a rival. Michael Fallon, Tory business minister, said yesterday: ‘Parliament decided, via the Postal Services Act 2011, to inject private capital into the company in order to secure the future of the universal postal service. ‘The structure and timing remain open, but Government is committed to doing that to ensure the ongoing viability of the company.’ A potential sell-off has been helped by shifting responsibility for Royal Mail’s pension fund to the taxpayer. Assets of £28.5billion were transferred to the Government along with £37.6billion of liabilities, which are the cost of pension promises to postal workers and its retired staff. Yesterday’s financial results revealed how the stamp price hike has hit Royal Mail’s letters business, with the number of letter deliveries dropping by 9 per cent. Miss Greene said however that 50p for a second-class stamp was a bargain. Insisting she did not mean to be ‘glib or flip’, she added: ‘Realistically, what can you buy for 50p today?’","The revelation means up to 27million of the 54million items of daily post are junk mail .

It is the book that could finally shed light on one of the world’s most keenly followed murder investigations. But Amanda Knox’s memoir will not appear on UK bookshelves, amid fears of legal action. Knox served four years in an Italian jail for the 2007 murder of her British flatmate Meredith Kercher in Perugia. 'Waiting To Be Heard': Amanda Knox, seen weeping in court in Perugia after her conviction was overturned in 2011, has written a book about her experiences following the murder of her former flatmate Meredith Kercher . She and former boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito were freed on appeal in 2011, but last month Italy’s highest court dramatically ruled the pair must face retrial. Knox, for now a free woman and living back in her hometown of Seattle, was due to release her memoir, Waiting to be Heard, on April 30. She had been paid a reported $4million advance. Axed: The news that Amanda Knox will face a retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher (left) has led to Harper Collins to cancel the UK publication of her memoir (right) in the UK on the advice of lawyers . But UK publishers Harper Collins said after taking legal advice, the book will not be published here in the UK - although it will still be published in the U.S. It is understood the memoir could attract legal action under the UK’s strict libel laws. Knox has already been convicted of defaming her former boss, bar owner Patrick Lumumba, whom she accused of killing Meredith. In a similar case, in January this year, the publication of a Scientology expose was cancelled in the UK. Publishers Transworld said, after taking legal advice, that the book was ‘not robust enough for the UK market.’ Last month the lawyer who set up Knox's multi-million dollar publishing deal hinted that the memoir contained major revelations, as he insisted publication would go ahead despite the re-trial ordered by Italy's highest court. Robert Barnett said in an interview that certain aspects of the book would 'shock you to the core.' The 25-year-old's first television interview, with ABC anchor Diane Sawyer, is also due to be broadcast on April 30. Knox is said to have collapsed when she learned that she would face a retrial over the murder of Ms Kercher in a 2am phone call from her lawyer last month. She will not voluntarily return to Italy to face trial, and is unlikely to be extradited by the U.S. As such she is expected to be tried in absentia. Re-trial: Amanda Knox (left) and her Italian former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (right) were both freed on appeal in 2011 after spending four years behind bars for the 2007 murder of the Leeds University student . Judges in Rome's supreme court accepted there were 'contradictions' in the case, quashing the acquittals of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29. The pair, both of whom spent four years behind bars in Italy before they were freed, were informed they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21-year-old student. Ms Kercher, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Italy as an exchange student from Leeds University. She was found dead in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the picturesque hilltop town of Perugia. Her throat had been slit and her semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet. After a lengthy trial in Perugia, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the murder in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively, . But two years later the pair were freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and DNA evidence contaminated. A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence, reduced from 30 years on appeal. The fact that Amanda Knox's memoir will hit the shelves in the U.S. as planned despite being pulled in the UK in light of her retrial is evidence of the vast divide between libel laws on either side of the pond. The stringent nature of UK libel laws has led activists to campaign for changes to legislation they claim has a negative impact on freedom of expression. Lawyers, publishers, bloggers, journalists and scientists are among those to point to the 'chilling effect' of current UK libel laws on legitimate publication, highlighting instances of 'libel tourism' - which sees wealthy individuals or corporations from overseas using the British courts to silence their critics. Critics argue that existing English libel laws favour claimants - with the onus on the defendant to prove that they are innocent - and that the high cost of defending a libel action forces defendants to settle out of court even when they believe what they published was true. In the U.S., in contrast, the freedom of speech and freedom of the press is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.","Waiting To Be Heard won't appear on UK bookshelves, says Harper Collins .

An immigrant couple who enjoyed a champagne lifestyle have been jailed for what is believed to be the biggest car insurance scam of its kind in Britain. Latvian Elina Jaksone and her Cypriot partner Gagik Manucharyan raked in close to £1million by duping hundreds of innocent motorists with a ‘ghost’ insurance scheme. They offered cut-price insurance by using false details, leaving customers involved in accidents totally exposed and without any of the coverage they paid for. Jailed: Gagik Manucharyan, left, and Elina Jaksone, right, have been imprisoned for defrauding insurance companies out of thousands and spending the money on holidays in destinations like Mauritius, pictured . They pocketed £100-a-time from the scam, raking in about £920,000 over seven years. They spent it on a luxury home, driving ‘his and hers’ Mercedes, enjoying five-star exotic holidays and even sent one of their children to private school. Canterbury Crown Court heard the shameless pair, from Westgate-on-Sea, Kent, did not pay a penny in tax on their earnings of more than £130,000 a year and owed the Inland Revenue £340,000. Jaksone, 36, also pocketed £82,000 in benefits to which she was not entitled by posing as a single mother and using her own mother’s details to falsely claim pension credits and the winter fuel allowance. Judge James O’Mahony called the couple ‘greedy and selfish’ and ordered them to be deported after they had served their sentences. Home: The immigrant couple bought this luxury house in Kent using their ill-gotten gains . Lifestyle: The fraudsters made enough money to send their son to an elite private school . He said they ‘couldn’t have cared less’ for the financial suffering of their clients left with void insurance. He added: ‘You have made a considerable amount of money but paid not one penny piece of tax. ‘You spared yourself little of the best things in life; expensive cars, holidays in Mauritius and Jamaica and private education for one of your children.’ Manucharyan, 40, was jailed for five years and two months and Jaksone, 36, for five years, for insurance and benefit fraud. The judge rejected a plea by their lawyers to spare them jail because they would miss their children, adding: ‘That misery is of your own making.’ More than 30 drivers who took out policies through the couple gave evidence against them. The jury heard how the couple told clients they could secure discount insurance through their firm, then used false details to take out cheap policies with legitimate firms. The couple pocketed about £100 in brokerage fees for each policy they arranged. The fraud came to light after tip-offs to the HMRC, and an investigation by the Serious Organised Crime Agency and Department for Work and Pensions. After the trial David Margee of HMRC said the scam was the ‘largest of its kind’ in the UK, adding: ‘They cheated honest, law-abiding people, spending their ill-gotten gains on a lifestyle many of us can only dream of.’","Elina Jaksone and Gagik Manucharyan exploited other immigrants .

We all like the occasional midnight snack, but Lesley Cusack claims to have midnight feasts of up to 2,500 calories every night – in her sleep. Mrs Cusack, 55, insists her raids on the fridge are not merely a massive attack of the munchies, but are the result of a rare medical condition. The mother-of-three said she only discovers what she has eaten overnight when she sifts through the leftovers and empty packets strewn around her house in the morning. Lesley Cusack cooks even while she is asleep, but says her raids on the fridge are the result of a rare medical condition . The mother-of-three's nocturnal bingeing is not confined to food. The retired department store manager says she has also tried to eat paint, Vaseline and washing powder . Alarmingly, she even chops up food and tries to cook it on her gas hob while asleep. But her nocturnal bingeing is not confined to food. The retired department store manager says she has also tried to eat paint, Vaseline and washing powder. Because her nightly calorific intake is the recommended daily amount for a man, her weight ballooned to 16 and a half stone. As a result, she eats just fruit and salads during the day and has joined a slimming club to keep her weight under control. Her doctors have not been able to give an explanation, but Mrs Cusack believes she suffers from a syndrome called nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder (NSRED). She said: ‘I had started to find bits of mess downstairs, but I didn’t realise it was me. It was a while before I worked it out, but when I did, I felt very embarrassed and guilty. Lesley, 55, must eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables during the day because she unconsciously eats junk food in her sleep . The mother-of-three must reserve morning fry-ups for special occasions because she has been known to rustle up a cooked breakfast in her sleep . ‘There were times when I felt extremely depressed through trying to hide it.’ Mrs Cusack, from Warrington, Cheshire, believes she has been suffering from NSRED for several years. But she has only just told her family and sought medical help. She says she has broken some of her teeth and bruised herself by trying to cook and eat food in the dark while asleep. The illness that strikes at night . She finally decided to seek help after realising she was going outside to raid the freezer in her shed. ‘I was terrified at the thought of leaving the door open or having an accident outside,’ she said. Using the cooker, kettle and sharp knives means it’s only a matter of time before something more serious happens.’ The divorcee, who lives alone, examines her kitchen every morning to find out what she’s eaten at night – much of it junk food. She added: ‘I tend to find opened tins of things or packets and I’ve no idea whether I’ve eaten some of them cold or not. ‘I’ve found soup in pans, but also in bowls. It all can get rather messy. I’ve put alarms on my doors in the hope it will wake me up. I simply turn it off in my sleep. I’m trying to lose weight but it’s a constant battle. I can follow a diet to the letter but it goes to pot at night. ‘One weekend, I came down to find the cake slice covered in butter. I’d used it while making cheese sandwiches. ‘The worst things that I know I’ve eaten are emulsion paint, Vaseline, cough syrup, raw potatoes and soap powder. The night I ate paint was the only time I’ve ever woken up. I can still remember standing in the kitchen touching my mouth and being very confused. ‘My bedding and night clothes are constantly getting stained and need washing. I’m always finding a trail of food leading downstairs. ‘The disturbed nights, waking exhausted with stomach cramp, feeling sick and finding food in the bed has become almost normal.’ Dr Paul Reading, President of the British Sleep Society and a consultant neurologist at James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, said such cases were rare but not unknown. Lesley has been keeping a visual diary of her nocturnal habits. In this instance she has eaten an unusual combination of a satsuma, a banana, cherry tomatoes a Kit Kat and a Fudge bar . This photo provides evidence of a midnight meal comprising of beetroot, cottage cheese and pickled onions. Hazard: From this photo you can see that Lesley has attempted to poach eggs, which would require using a cooker in her sleep . ‘A proportion of adult sleep-walkers will eat and even cook during apparent sleep, often consuming foods they would not normally enjoy,’ he said. ‘Weight gain and guilt are common consequences.’ Mrs Cusack is now waiting to see a specialist who she hopes will confirm she has NSRED. ‘Living with something that no one sees but that affects my life so much is sometimes impossible to cope with,’ she said. ‘There have got to be more people struggling with this condition. I can’t be the only person.’ Holiday hell: Lesley's condition makes staying with friends difficult because she is frightened she will raid their kitchen too .","Lesley Cusack, 55, says she has Nocturnal Sleep-Related Eating Disorder .

A Texan couple who were anonymously abused on an internet forum have won $13.8 million in damages for defamation - In what could be a landmark ruling for freedom of speech online. Mark and Rhonda Lesher were awarded the sum by the District Court of Tarrant County, after being called sexual deviants, molesters and drug pushers on Topix.com boards created to discuss the couple's sexual assault arrest and trial in 2008. The couple were cleared of all charges against them in January 2009 and subsequently the couple filed their civil lawsuit against the anonymous posters in February 2009. Mark and Rhonda Lesher of Clarksville, Texas were awarded $13.8 million dollars by the District Court of Tarrant County after being anonymously abused on the online forum Topix . Upon doing so a Texan judge ordered Topix to turn over all identifying information about the anonymous posters, including Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. These unique numbers assigned to personal computers alerted authorities to businesses owned by the husband of the woman who accused the couple of sexual assault in 2008. 'This vindicates us,' said Mark Lesher, reported the Texarkana Gazette. 'This is vindication for all the scurrilous, vile, defamatory statements that caused us to be indicted, to be tried, that caused us to move out of town and my wife to lose her business.' The Clarksville, Texas couple were awarded the money after the District judge said that their reputation and livelihoods had suffered from the anonymous abuse online . The Lesher's lawsuit investigation led to six parties being named as defendants in an amended petition, according to ABC News. They were Shannon Coyel, the couple's accuser from the original criminal trial in 2008, her husband Gerald Coyel and his brother James Coyel. In addition, the suit also named the business Apache Truck & Van Parts in Kennedale, Texas and two employees there Charlie and Pat Doescher. Finding in the Lesher's favour the court has ordered Jerry Coyel to pay Mark Lesher $5.1 million for mental anguish and loss of his reputation. Mark and Rhonda Lesher on the steps of Collin County Courthouse in McKinney, Texas, shortly after their acquittal of sexual assault charges Jan. 16, 2009 . It also ordered Shannon Coyel and Charlie Doesher to pay $1.7 million to Mr Lesher, according to the jury. Furthermore, Jerry Coyel was ordered to pay Rhonda Lesher $3.169 million for mental anguish, loss of her reputation and the loss of her beauty salon business in Clarksville. Also, it compelled Shannon Coyel and Charlie Doesher to pay Mrs Lesher $1.056 million each. Neither the Coyels or the Doeshers could be reached for a comment. The jury in the defamation lawsuit heard that since the ultimately unfounded rape allegations were heard in 2008, a total of 25,000 comments on 70 threads on Topix message boards were posted onto the Internet. Tarrant County Courthouse: 25,000 comments on 70 different threads on Topix were trawled through to identify the common IP addresses were the majority of the defamatory comments originated . 'If the award is upheld, then people will think twice about what they say,' said Ryan Calo, a privacy law tutor at Stanford Law School. 'Defamation is one area of law in which a jury or court have to figure out how much damage has been done. 'It's not a car accident where you can calculate medical bills and how much work was lost after an injury. There's something more ephemeral in a reputation.' Calling into question the effect of this ruling on free speech, Calo acknowledged the growth of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Apache Truck & Van Parts in Kennedale, Texas, where two the identified defendants, Charlie and Pat Doescher worked . 'Everyone knows people say crazy things on the Internet, especially when they do it anonymously.' When the Lesher's filed their 365-page lawsuit three years ago, they were accused of murder, pedophilia and drug taking. Even though they had been exonerated of all charged against them in January, they still had to leave their homes and businesses as a direct result of the abuse online. Naming the 179 pseudonyms used to post what they believed constituted defamatory messages, the Lesher's served Topix with a subpoena to obtain the IP adressess. Topix responded that the request was too much but a judge in California, where Topix is headquartered ruled that they had to release any identifying information related to the suit. District Court of Tarrant County: After his victory in his defamation lawsuit Mark Lesher said 'You can't post anonymous lies on the Internet without suffering the consequences.' At the same time he granted Topix a protective order on their information and lawyers and Topix narrowed the search for targets. They discovered that 70 percent of the postings on Topix came from only a narrow number of IP addresses. Going forward with the investigation they discovered that the pseudonym 'ilbedipt' was registered to Apache Truck & Van Parts. 'Once they got it down to a small number of people who were vociferous, I'm not surprised they were able to get a libel judgment,' said Chris Tolles, CEO of Topix to ABC News. As well as facing financial ruin as a result of their actions, the Coyels are facing a malicious prosecution suit for conspiring to convict the Leshers of a false crime. The trial by jury is expected in August.","Ruling could have effect on social networking sites such as Twitter .

It is one of the most anticipated pieces of technology since the iPhone - but also one of the most feared. Google's Glass wearable computer is set to go on sale to the public next year - and a growing number of complaints could see it banned in hundreds of public places by the time it launches. Today legal experts warned of a massive 'legal brawl' over the gadget. Google co-founder Sergey Brin wearing Glass, the firm's wearable computer. Today it was revealed establishments such as cinemas, banks, parks and even strip clubs are planning to ban them amid privacy fears . Early 'explorer' versions are being sold for £1,000 ($1,500), although consumer versions are expected to be significantly cheaper. Piper Jaffray, an analyst firm, . estimates that wearable technology and another major initiative, . self-driving cars, could ultimately be a $500 billion opportunity for . the company. In the shorter term, IHS, a forecasting firm, estimates . that shipments of smart glasses, could be as high . as $6.6 million in three years. Already users wearing Google Glass eyewear have been told they are banned from strip clubs, cinemas and casinos because their . owners don’t want them filming there. In West Virginia legislators tried to . make it illegal to use the gadget while driving - and plan to launch . another legal attack before it becomes widely available next year. 'This is just the beginning,' Timothy Toohey, a Los Angeles lawyer specializing in privacy issues, told the New York Times. 'Google Glass is going to cause quite a brawl.' The 5 Point Cafe, a Seattle dive bar, was the first to explicitly ban Glass, launching a campaign to warn customers months before the gadget was available. Many saw it as a publicity stunt - but dozens of places have now followed. Experts say the gadget could challenge privacy laws around the world. 'Google Glass will test the right to privacy versus the First Amendment,' said Bradley Shear, a social media expert at George Washington University. Nick Pickles, director of British privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'The implications of them being controlled by an unknown third party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip. Thad Starner, a pioneer of wearable computing who is a technical adviser to the Glass team, said he and colleagues had experimented with Glass-type devices for years, 'and I can’t think of a single instance where something bad has happened.' However, University of Toronto computer . engineering professor and wearable computer pioneer Steve Mann was at a McDonald’s restaurant in Paris . last when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget . he designed from his head. Assault: The three men, one wearing a McDonad's shirt, another with a McDonald's name tag, not visible, demanded to know why Dr Mann had the glasses . Google has tried to play down the controversy. 'We’re acutely aware of those questions,' Schmidt responded to similar concerns raised at Harvard over the device's abilities being so new. 'We want to be very careful that this new invention is not misused ... But I’m always concerned about premature regulation based on fear, as opposed to understanding what’s possible. 'The people who’ve used Glass, including myself, report it as remarkable. I’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways,' Schmidt said. Nerds! In a Tumblr gallery titled, White Men Wearing Google Glass, photos are uploaded showing current users of the device to wide poking and name calling, one such photo pictured . Google Glass offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your surroundings and while Google’s main interest is selling advertising, there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all they can to get access to a device. 'The only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them.' Google says that Glass is a work in progress, with test versions now being released to 2,000 developers. Another 8,000 'explorers,' people handpicked by Google, will soon get a pair after winning an online contest. Google admits the technology is still facing issues. - Google chairman Eric Schmidt . 'We are thinking very carefully about how we design Glass because new technology always raises new issues,' said Courtney Hohne, a Google spokeswoman. However, the firm has also encouraged developers to experiment with the device - and at its developer conference in San Francisco next week is holding sessions dedicated to 'Hacking Google Glass'. 'Our goal is to make the world better,' Google chairman Eric Schmidt said of the device at Harvard University last week. 'We’ll . take the criticism along the way, but criticisms are inevitably from . people who are afraid of change or who have not figured out that there . will be an adaptation of society to it,' he said.

'The people who’ve used Glass, including myself, report it as remarkable. I’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways,' Schmidt said. Business owners have been unimpressed. Peter Feinstein, managing partner of Sapphire Gentlemen's Club in Las Vegas, said that patrons will be asked to check the eyewear when they come in. He said: ‘We've been dealing with the cellphone videoing and the picture taking over the years and we are quick to make sure that that doesn't happen in the club. ‘As the sale of (Google Glass) spreads, there'll be more people using them and wanting to use them at places such as a gentlemen's club. ‘If we see those in the club, we would do the same thing that we do to people who bring cameras into the club. Google has released a series of images showing off the glasses being used to capture video . The glasses will also be able to take part in live video chats . ‘If they don't want to check it, we'd be happy to give them a limo ride back to their hotel’. A spokesman for MGM resorts, which owns the MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas, said that picture-taking was ‘frowned upon’ inside its properties. He said: ‘Security officers on duty ask individuals not to take pictures for the privacy of others in the casino. ‘This new product is nothing new in terms of a challenge for us, because for so many years, the very tiniest of portable lipstick and pinpoint cameras have been around.’ Regal Entertainment Group, one of the . largest cinema chains in the US, added that no recording devices were . permitted into its cinemas. The MGM Grand Hotel and Casino is one of the first to ban Google Glass . With . a quiet wink of an eye Google Glass users will now be able to take a . picture thanks to one of many new apps released and currently in . development for the device. Snap! A new app for Google Glass called Winky allows users to take pictures with the blink of an eye . Ordinarily Glass users must deliver an audible command of, 'OK, Glass, Take a picture,' to kick in the camera's software. However with its release this week program Winky will additionally give users the option of silently ordering the command. 'You . might not think it's hard to say ""Ok, Glass Take a Picture"" or even . just tap a button.

Thousands of Britons risk suffering a full-blown stroke because they fail to recognise the small, early warning of a 'mini attack'. Two thirds of people do not recognise the symptoms of a small stroke and three quarters would not go to the emergency room if they did experience them, a charity survey found. One in ten people who suffer the symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) go on to have a stroke within a week if they remain untreated, the Stroke Association said. Warning signs that apply to TIA and stroke . A TIA, is a sign that part of the brain isn't getting enough blood. Each year more than 46,000 people have their first TIA. Yet, of 2,000 people surveyed by ICM . Research, 66 per cent had never heard of the condition motivating the . charity to raise awareness of the symptoms to look out for. They include pins and needles down one side, facial weakness, speech problems that often last only a short time. Lead researcher of the project, Peter . Rothwell, the professor of clinical neurology at Oxford said: 'A TIA is . an emergency and a significant proportion of people will go on to have a . major stroke if they don’t seek urgent medical attention. Two thirds of people miss the signs of a mini stroke which can lead to a full-blown stroke unless treated. Symptoms include facial weakness . ‘However, this poll suggests that the signs of a TIA are still being ignored. ‘This needs to change.’ Chief executive of the Stroke Association, John Barrick said: ‘Over 150,000 people have a stroke every year in the UK but up to 10,000 of these could be prevented if more people were aware of the symptoms of TIA and sought out emergency treatment. 'Not only would this save thousands from a lifetime of disability, it would also save the health service a considerable sum. 'Anyone who experiences the symptoms, regardless of whether they disappear within a matter of minutes, should go to hospital immediately. Assume it's a stroke until it's proven not to be by a medical professional.' The Stroke Association advises people to use 'Fast' to look out for key signs of a TIA or stroke. They are: Facial weakness, arm weakness, speech problems. They advise calling 999 if they spot a single one of these symptoms. Most people affected by stroke are over 65, but they can happen to anyone, including children and even babies. Treatments for TIA include lifestyle changes, along with blood thinning drugs and high cholesterol medication.

Dementia holds a real fear for two out of every three older people, but the majority don’t want to learn more about the disease, a survey has found. It reveals that 66 per cent of people aged 55 and over have worries about brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s. It is this age group that has the biggest fears, as they are of an age where it becomes a very real threat. And 61 per cent of those aged between 18 to 24 - the age group whose parents are likely to be affected - also express worries. Carey Mulligan is now an Ambassador for the Alzheimer's Society - her grandmother was diagnosed with the condition eight years ago . More women than men are anxious about dementia, 70 per cent compared with 56 per cent of men. However, fewer than one in six older people want to learn more about the disease, says a joint poll commissioned by Alzheimer’s Society and Saga Homecare published today. Oscar-nominated actress, Carey Mulligan, has become an 'ambassador' for the Alzheimer's Society to promote better awareness and less fear of the condition. Her grandmother was diagnosed with the disease eight years ago and the 26-year-old said while her 'Nans' no longer recognises her she still takes delight in music. She added that although her grandmother's decline had been painful for the whole family, the support provided by her care home was 'inspirational' and showed people with dementia can be helped to live well. Ms Mulligan, who starred in An Education, told the BBC the key was 'remembering that those with dementia are still people and they still have stories and they still have character and they're all individuals and they're all unique. And they just need to be interacted with on a human level.' Around 800,000 Britons have a form of dementia, with symptoms affecting memory, thinking, communicating and doing everyday tasks. Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, while other forms include vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. In just 15 years a million people will be living with the condition. A YouGov survey - released to mark Dementia Awareness Week - found that overall 63 per cent of people say they are worried about dementia in some way. Most are worried about either themselves or someone they know developing dementia in later life, with just one in four people saying they are unconcerned. The survey of more than 4,000 British adults found one in five believe there is nothing you can do to reduce your risk of developing dementia. And fewer than a fifth realise that it is a terminal illness. The Mail has consistently highlighted the issue in its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Two thirds of those aged over 55 worry about brain diseases . Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society charity, said people must overcome their fears and learn that early diagnosis can be critical for slowing down symptoms. He said ‘Dementia is the biggest challenge facing the UK today so it’s not surprising that people are so worried. There is currently no cure and people aren’t getting the care they deserve. However we know that with the right support people can live well with the condition for a number of years. ‘We need to stop worrying and start understanding dementia. Whether you have five minutes or half an hour please take some time to learn about dementia. ‘Only through knowing more will we ensure the people with the condition are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.’ Caroline Woodhead, 55, from North Yorkshire, has Alzheimer’s disease and is one of the three faces of Dementia Awareness Week. She said ‘Before I was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease I used to worry about it too. Now I have it. I’d rather I didn’t have it but I don’t dwell on it. ‘People don’t realise it’s possible to live well with dementia. I was diagnosed at the age of 52 and I still enjoy life - I can sing, drive, go for walks and use a computer. ‘I would encourage everyone to find out more about the condition. By understanding dementia better, we can break down these barriers and show that life does not end with a diagnosis.’ Dementia Awareness Week is being held in partnership with Saga Homecare. Saga Homecare, which is part of the larger Saga group, provides care at home for people who want to maintain their independence and stay in their own homes. Ros Altmann, Director-General of Saga, said: ‘As the largest provider of care in the UK, Saga has extensive first-hand experience of providing ongoing support to people with dementia and their families. ‘In April, the Prime Minister committed to improving the lives of those suffering with dementia and their carers in his Dementia Challenge. We have been working with and advising the Government on this policy and the importance of preventative and early treatments. ‘It is clear that many people are worried about this condition but they shouldn’t think there is nothing they can do. ‘We want to help people understand dementia better so that they can get preparations in place for them and their family. ‘There are preventative steps we can all take such as leading a healthy lifestyle, eating the right foods and keeping our minds and bodies active but it is also vital to spot the early signs of dementia to seek diagnosis and treatments. ‘We’re committed to helping the lives of people living with dementia and their families - from providing specialist care to people in their homes to helping people take a well deserved and much needed holiday’ she added.","'We need to stop worrying and start understanding dementia,' says charity spokesman .

And Strictly Come Dancing is just as big a hit with overseas viewers, the latest figures reveal. The BBC show earned the corporation tens of millions of pounds in licensing fees last year as it topped the list of the most successful exports. The format – known internationally as Dancing With The Stars – is now sold to 43 countries through the corporation’s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. Popular pairing: Strictly Come Dancing with Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly is the BBC's most successful export . The most recent nation to succumb to the dance competition’s penchant for sequins and salsa was Thailand, which finished screening its first series this week after buying the right to the format last autumn. Dancing With The Stars now attracts a global audience of more than 250million people worldwide. The US version is judged by Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli, who also sit on the British panel. But while a peak of 14million viewers saw Louis Smith take the Strictly trophy in last year’s UK final, US ratings have peaked at 27.5million. In India, where the show is known as Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, competitors put on exuberant Bollywood-themed routines. The most recent BBC Worldwide figures show the top-selling formats for the part financial year since last April. Hit cookery show The Great British Bake Off came second in the list for the second year running. The BBC2 programme, hosted in the UK by Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, has now been commissioned in 11 countries, including the US, Australia and France. Winning formula: Flavia Cacace and Louis Smith in last year's Strictly Come Dancing . It was originally licensed to Belgium, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark in 2011/12. The show is tweaked for each country to take into account delicacies and local ingredients. In Belgium, for example, the amateur cooks are challenged to make everything from pizzas to the nation’s ‘miserable cakes’ an almond sponge cake with buttercream filling. In third place, makeover show What Not To Wear continues to earn money for the BBC despite being scrapped in the UK in 2007. The programme, which offers sartorial advice to women, was originally presented by Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, and has been among the top-five international sellers for the past three years. As well as licensing show formats for producers to remake overseas, BBC Worldwide also sells British shows ready-made. Although the division will not say how much each programme has made ‘for commercial reasons’ the licencing of formats brought in £135.5million in 2011/12 while finished programmes made £292.7million. In the last financial year, Sir David Attenborough’s hit natural history series Planet Earth easily topped the list of ready-made sales, with Natural World coming second. Jeremy Clarkson’s motoring show Top Gear was third, proving popular in Canada, Japan, Bahrain and Belgium. MI5 spy series Spooks came fourth, boosted by its popularity in Serbia and Iran, while Doctor Who sold well in Brazil, Israel, Spain and Turkey. On Sunday (24), BBC Worldwide will host its annual showcase event in Liverpool, with 700 international buyers invited to bid for the latest BBC programmes. The event is the world’s largest international television market hosted by a single distributor. Elin Thomas from BBC Worldwide, said: ‘Dancing with the Stars is one of the world’s most successful formats. She added ‘Selling formats to international broadcasters is very different from licensing a readymade TV programme such as The Paradise or Africa. ‘When a foreign channel licenses a format, this means they produce their own version of the show with their own local cast and will usually film it in their own country.

'The situation is ambiguous,' he said. 'The customer asked me to pour burning absinthe. Usually we do it with sambuca, but the guest is always right so, warning him of the danger, I tried to do it. He said Mr Ponamarev had messed up the stunt by covering his mouth. 'We immediately tried to give him first aid, put a wet towel on his face and offered to smear it with cream,' added Mr Bykov. The bar's management said they hoped the situation could be resolved amicably.","Alexey Ponamarev, 28, is now preparing to sue the bar for more than £10,000 after he was left with burns on his face and ear ."

Ecuador's President Rafael Correa says Britain is not in a position to preach about its decision to offer asylum to Julian Assange when it failed to extradite former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet. Correa has infuriated British officials by offering protection at the Ecuador embassy in London to the Wikileaks founder who is wanted for sex assault and rape allegations in Sweden. The South American nation's socialist leader says he shares the former computer hacker's fears that he could be sent from Sweden to the U.S. to face charges over WikiLeak's publication in 2010 of thousands of secret U.S. cables. Both U.S. and European government sources say no criminal charges against Assange have been issued by the U.S. and that Washington has launched no attempt to extradite him. Britain says it is determined to fulfill a legal obligation to send Assange to Sweden. But Correa said London had made its own rules in the past - specifically, by not extraditing Pinochet, who was charged with multiple human rights violations. 'Pinochet was not extradited for humanitarian reasons, when there were dozens of Europeans and thousands of Latin Americans who were murdered, and tens of thousands of people were tortured during the Pinochet dictatorship,' he told reporters in the country's capital Quito. Pinochet was arrested by British police at a hospital in London in 1998 after Spain demanded his extradition for alleged torture and murder, including of Spanish citizens, during his 1973-1990 rule. The British government decided in 2000 that the frail Pinochet was unfit to stand trial and free to fly home. He died six years later in Santiago, Chile, aged 91. 'If Pinochet was not extradited for humanitarian reasons then it's clear that they can take the decision not to extradite Mr. Julian Assange,' Correa said. The British government decided in 2000 that the frail Pinochet was unfit to stand trial and free to fly home. He died six years later in Santiago, Chile, aged 91. He is seen here receiving a visit by Margaret Thatcher in Wentworth .

'The alleged sexual offences are not considered crimes in Latin America, or in 95 per cent of the world,' Correa said. He has won broad support for his position on Assange from other South American governments, framing the embassy saga as a struggle between his small country and 'imperialist' powers. 'We cannot ignore the fact that some countries have a lot of weight,' Correa said. 'But something has changed: Latin America no longer has patrons. We don't bow to pressure.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:50 EST, 19 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:24 EST, 20 January 2013 . Reader: Joanna Trollops believes being able to read should be a given, not a privilege . As leading author Joanna Trollope helps the Duchess of Cornwall launch the Children’s Reading Fund, she argues that illiteracy is probably the worst affliction that can befall a child other than abuse. They aim to raise £2 million to make access to books a right – not a luxury. Most of us have a nostalgic picture of the ideal bedtime story session – the clean, drowsy children, safe within the circle of a reading parent’s arm, a picture book, a comforting adult voice, the seductive fascination of narrative. But, sadly, that idyllic picture – even if it ever universally existed  – is no longer the case. Even if there is time, in modern families with two working parents, for such an idealised ritual, the shocking fact is that hundreds of thousands of children couldn’t take part in a bedtime story session – because they can’t read well enough, or worse, at all. For those of us who have read comfortably and easily from a young age, this is an appalling state of affairs – especially in this apparently sophisticated age. I suppose – and I bet I am far from alone – I have always taken reading for granted. From those early years with a torch under the bedclothes – Tess Of The D’Urbervilles and Jane Eyre all night long when I was about 13 – to right now, when I never go anywhere without something to read, and regard it as being as natural and necessary as breathing. It isn’t just that reading enables me to do my job – writing novels – but it also means that I can travel, shop, drive, communicate, enlighten and amuse myself, be alone, learn and develop. Those gifts, vital to a mentally healthy and satisfying life, are exactly what too many children growing up in care or in households without books are being deprived of. And, more tragically, the awareness of what reading and narrative mean to an even halfway good life. You could say that my children and grandchildren were privileged, growing up as they did and do in houses full of books with parents who actively encourage reading and set an example by constantly reading themselves. Indeed, I read to my grandchildren now out of their parents’ old books, held together by crackly strips of ancient Sellotape – Richard Scarry and Tove Jansson are particular favourites – but my point is that such a situation should not be one of privilege. Invaluable: Trollope says we must learn to love books when young . It should be the norm. Reading, for every child in this supposedly civilised country, should be an absolute given. There is a horrible statistic. I’m going to give it to you because it illustrates the problem so vividly. It is this. If you are a child in care, or even being fostered, in the UK in 2013, you have a greater chance of ending up in prison than in further education. And so much of that frightening danger is attributable to illiteracy. Children being moved from household to household and institution to institution never get the consistency of attention to learn to read. Too often, they are in communities where there is no place for books, no time to be taught and helped to read. They have no opportunity to discover the infinite comfort and companionship of books and stories, let alone the chances in life that being able to read gives you – and which not being able to read shuts you out of, for ever. I don’t think it’s at all helpful to blame anyone. This situation has arisen, as so much of modern life has arisen, from people reacting to the way things are, the way things have become. But that doesn’t mean that we should accept, for a nanosecond, that illiteracy is just one of those things. It is probably the worst affliction that can befall a deprived modern child, after actual abuse. Are we proud to live in a society where nearly a quarter of our 16-year- olds have a reading age of nine? It isn’t just their inevitably diminished lives that matter, but the effect on all the thousands of other people whom their lives and reduced capacities will impact on, in their lifetimes. To help this vital cause is to insure for a better future for countless people. So when you next think that you are too busy – or too distracted by the pressures of our modern obsession with perpetual communication – to give time to helping your child to read, or to read with one who needs encouragement to persist, or even just wants a reading companion, think again. What would your life be like if you couldn’t read? Well – it IS like that. For hundreds and thousands of our children. Right now. And it needn’t be. The Children’s Reading Fund is specifically targeting children in care and children in poverty. There can be no better way out of these miserable situations than giving these children the best possible tool to help themselves. And being able to read is that tool. Not a luxury, not a privilege, but a basic human right. Wouldn’t you say?",Trollope writes of her sadness that hundreds of thousands of children can't take part in a bedtime story session – because they can’t read well enough.
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:58 EST, 7 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:14 EST, 7 May 2013 . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg promised to end 'abuse' of the benefits system . Immigrants to Britain will not be able to claim benefits without proving they have contributed to the welfare state by working, under plans to be set out by the government. Benefits, housing and healthcare will be limited to new arrivals who are willing to work and paid taxes to fund state-backed support. A package of reforms will be included in tomorrow’s Queen’s Speech including major law changes needed to limit the claims that can be made by Romanians and Bulgarians when controls are lifted next year. Ministers will also use existing powers to enforce secondary legislation needed to stop ‘abuse’ of the tax and benefits system. However, government sources say the details are yet to be fleshed out, and the flagship Immigration Bill is unlikely to be published in full until the autumn. The moves will be seen as a reaction to the electoral threat posed by the UK Independence Party, which rocked the political establishment this week by taking votes and council seats from all the main parties. UKIP leader Nigel Farage focussed on the impact of immigration, and how membership of the EU stopped Britain acting to limit it, during much of the local election campaign. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today signalled that the days of Britain’s benefits ‘free-for-all’ for foreigners were over. He said: ‘We have been very clear that we totally get that there’s a heightened level of public anxiety about immigration. ‘We should stamp out abuse and make sure our public services and benefits are not simply a free-for-all, there needs to be some relation between what you put in and what you get out,’ he told BBC Breakfast. Ministers will use the Welfare Reform Act, passed in the last year, to close a loophole that allowed migrants who no longer have a right to work here to carry on claiming benefits. The test that decides who can access benefits will also be tightened. Migrants from the European Economic Area will be told that they can only receive Jobseeker’s Allowance if they are genuinely looking for a job. It will include a tougher test to ensure they can speak English properly. The National Health Service will be given more powers to recoup costs for treating people from overseas  while access to benefits from Jobcentres will be curbed if migrants cannot speak English . Migrants will be given only six months to find a job before benefits stop, unless they can prove they are close to getting a job. David Cameron responded to fears about the appeal of Britain's benefits system in drawing immigrants to Britain. He put immigration minister Mark . Harper in charge of a Cabinet committee examining the 'pull factors' which needed to be addressed. It also included ministers for health, . housing, legal aid and welfare. Ministers are in talks with other EU countries about whether jobless migrants can be the responsibility of their home country before they start claiming benefits in the UK. Britain would also like to curb the £36million paid every year in child benefit to 24,000 families who do live in the UK. The government also wants to end the idea that the NHS is a ‘free international health service’. Efforts will be stepped up to recoup costs from migrants who use the NHS, through charging or requiring private medical insurance. David Cameron used a major speech on immigration in March to insist housing, benefits and healthcare should not be available free of charge to anyone arriving in Britain . One in ten new rentals of social homes goes to a foreign national. New guidance from this spring will set a local residence test, to ensure people with ties to a local area can get priority for housing. Migrants will have to have lived – and worked - in the UK for two years before their qualify for a state-funded home. Illegal immigrants will also face tougher checks to stop them getting driving licences, credit cards, personal loans or a council house. Mr Clegg said: ‘This Government will take further measures to ensure that, yes, of course we should be a welcoming, generous country to those people who want to come here and make a contribution. ‘But people who want to come here – worst of all illegally – or want to come here and sort of abuse our generosity and use our benefits and public services when they’re not really properly entitled to do so, yes, we need to clamp down on that,’ he told ITV’s Daybreak. ‘So, yes, to a sort of open and tolerant Britain, but no to abuse of the immigration system and that’s what we will make sure happens.’ The immigration bill expected in tomorrow's Queen's Speech will implement the major legal changes which cannot be made using secondary legislation. Mr Cameron has promised to ‘fight back very robustly’ against any attempts by the courts or the EU to block British curbs on benefits for migrants. In a speech in March, Mr the next stage of reform is to say, ‘Let’s not just reform the immigration system. Let’s make sure the housing system, the welfare system, the legal aid system, all of these things actually fit in – the health system – fit in with our immigration policy,’ sending a very clear message that people can come and work, but they can’t come for the wrong reasons.","Queen's Speech to include legal changes to limit access to public services .

Having a waltz around the room or enjoying a yoga class can work wonders for millions of people suffering from arthritis, say researchers. A study found hospital-based exercise programs such as Pilates, yoga or dance fitness can relieve the pain of the disease. American scientists studied at the effectiveness of exercise programmes run by the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. Do-si-do: Dancing once a week could relieve the pain of arthritis . They found the weekly programmes significantly improved enjoyment of life and balance, and decreased pain and the severity and frequency of falls. Sandra Goldsmith, director of the Public and Patient Education Department at HSS said: 'When participants were asked to report their level of pain severity, there were statistically significant reductions in pain from pre- to post-test. 'Pain is a huge factor in quality of life. If we can offer classes that help to reduce pain, that is a good thing.' Researchers evaluated the effectiveness of the exercise programs, which included weekly classes of Tai Chi, yoga, mat and chair Pilates and dance fitness on 200 participants. Surveys were administered before and after the exercise which included measures of self-reported pain, balance, falls and level of physical activity. A pain intensity scale was used to quantify intensity of muscle or joint pain. The team also measured pain interference on aspects of quality of life, including general activity, mood, walking ability, sleep, work, and enjoyment of life. Roughly 53 per cent indicated that they experienced pain relief as a result of participating. There was a 54 per cent improvement in general activity, mood, walking ability, sleep, normal work, and enjoyment of life. Fewer respondents reported falling from pre- to post-test and fewer sustained injuries that required hospitalisation. Dr Linda Russell, a rheumatologist, points out that the classes are low cost for patients. 'We like to get all of our patients involved in exercise. 'Patients benefit from supervised exercise programmes with regard to their overall sense of well-being and pain due to their arthritis.' Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability in the UK, affecting around 8.5million adults.

The former hospital annexe - built in . 1877 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee - is considered one of . Dover's finest pieces of Victorian architecture. Former glory: The Royal Victoria Hospital Annexe is considered to be one of Dover's finest historic buildings . Locals have said the flats are 'glaring tomato red', with some even saying the paint job has 'dazzled them' while driving. Accounts worker Sam Graham, 37, said: 'Every time I drive past the building I get dazzled by the paint. 'The first time I saw it I nearly swerved into another car - they really need to get it sorted soon.' The rules when redecorating or renovating listed properties are that any changes must be in keeping with the original character of the building. Care must be taken to preserve and enhance the period features, by choosing the same materials that were used originally. Listed Building Consent is needed for all kinds of work that involves alterations which affect the character of a listed building of special architectural or historic interest, which is determined by the local authority. If the property is in a conservation area, additional 'Article 4 Directions' apply, such as replacing a window with one of a similar design. For example, when replacing windows in a Victorian house, wooden frames are more appropriate than uPVC. James Robinson, who has lived in . Dover for more than 50 years, said: 'It's one of our finest buildings, . it survived the war but now look at it. 'It looks absolutely ridiculous.

Cowboy cosmetic surgery clinics are to be banned from treating patients unless their staff have proper qualifications. The Department of Health will today announce a review of the industry to protect women from botched breast enlargements and Botox injections administered by staff who have had just a few hours of training. The NHS Medical Director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, aims to tighten the rules on advertising and toughen up regulations. Concerns: The review was ordered into the cosmetic surgery industry after the recent issue with silicone gel breast implants manufactured by French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) (pictured) Health Secretary Andrew Lansley commissioned the review following fears over the safety of PIP breast implants. Senior sources say the Government is set to ban aggressive advertising of ‘two for one’ deals on cosmetic surgery – for instance a breast enlargement with a free tummy tuck – and clinics that encourage women to go under the knife purely for vanity reasons. The review is expected to recommend the creation of a compulsory register of implants so women’s health can be more readily monitored. Cosmetic surgeons will be forced to give patients more information about their treatments, for example warning women that breast implants are likely to need replacing every ten years. Women who have booked surgery are likely to be offered a cooling off period to allow them to rethink whether they need the treatments. And those carrying out the procedures will have to provide far better aftercare. The crackdown aims to drive cowboy . surgeons out of the industry and make it more difficult for . inexperienced beauty parlour workers to give Botox jabs, dermal fillers . or conduct laser hair removal. Botox . can currently be injected by anyone who has done a half-day-long course . in which they watch a demonstration and take a friend along to practise . on – although the drug does need to be prescribed by a doctor. Inexperienced: Botox can be injected by anyone who has undertaken a half-day-long course (posed by models) ‘There is a case for tightening up so that practitioners have to acquire more rigorous qualifications,’ a source said. Some 45 per cent of women and one in four men say they have considered cosmetic surgery. But a poll conducted for the Government has found that many consider the cost of surgery more important than the qualifications of the people doing it. Some 67 per cent of those questioned consider cost as a factor when deciding whether or not to have cosmetic surgery. Only 54 per cent take the qualifications of their practitioner into consideration. Sir Bruce will today announce the . creation of an expert panel to consider how regulations can be tightened . and patient care improved. The panel includes TV doctor Rosemary . Leonard, Catherine Kydd, a campaigner on PIP implants, plastic surgeon . Simon Withey and Trish Halpin, editor of Marie Claire magazine. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley ordered the review following fears over unsafe breast implants . Sir Bruce said: ‘The recent problems with PIP breast implants have shone a light on the cosmetic surgery industry. Many questions have been raised, particularly around the regulation of clinics, whether all practitioners are adequately qualified, how well people are advised when money is changing hands, aggressive marketing techniques and what protection is available when things go wrong. ‘I am concerned that too many people do not realise how serious cosmetic surgery is and do not consider the life-long implications – and potential complications – it can have. 'We want to hear views from everyone, particularly people who have experience of the cosmetic surgery industry or of other cosmetic interventions – good and bad – so we can learn what works best.’ Concern grew late last year over PIP implants, which were made by French company Poly Implant Prothese.

British women who were thought to have had them. ‘We would like the review to take this opportunity to draw a clear line between cosmetic treatments that are seen as a commodity and cosmetic surgery that is a serious medical treatment which must be provided by fully-trained and qualified surgeons.’ Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, added: ‘In an increasingly quick-fix and image-conscious society, it is quite easy to forget that cosmetic surgery has life-long implications. Patients must be assured that the practitioners have the right qualifications and experience.’ Layla Hinchen was devastated after discovering her breast implants had started to leak and would have to be removed.

When . her private clinic  refused to remove the implants, the NHS paid for . the bulk of the operation, with Miss Hinchen contr-ibuting £750 towards . new implants. The . beautician and hairdresser from Essex said: ‘I researched for a year . before I had mine done because I wanted the best people.

Watson, 55, is now in favour of tougher regulations for the industry. ‘I think all surgeons should be thoroughly vetted and have a long period . of practice time where they are supervised by top cosmetic surgeons . before they are let loose on the public,’ she said. ‘I . firmly believe cosmetic surgeons shouldn’t have free rein to play God . because people like me have to deal with the consequences.

New debate: Justice secretary Chris Grayling will bring the Bill before parliament . MPs will be given the opportunity to deny prisoners the vote in a last-minute move aimed at ending a bitter seven-year dispute over a European Court ruling. The UK's current blanket ban on prisoners voting has been judged as . unlawful by The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and officials in . Strasbourg have given the Government until Friday to comply with the . ruling. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will this week table a Bill that includes options to give some inmates the right to vote after judges ruled that a blanket ban breached human rights. These could include giving the vote to those sentenced to less than six months, or extending the franchise to prisoners locked up for under four years. But the draft legislation will also have a proposal to retain the status quo as demanded by David Cameron, who has said the idea of prisoners voting makes him feel sick. Only a few Lib Dems are likely to rebel over the issue. Ministers believe putting the choices before Parliament will satisfy the European Court of Human Rights, which ordered Britain to take ‘concrete measures’  to resolve the issue this year. But critics claim it could mean disenfranchised prisoners being handed £100 million in compensation if the court decides the Bill does not go far enough. The issue was put before the Commons in a non-binding vote last year, where MPs rejected it. The court has given Britain until Friday to comply with its ruling. A Government source said: ‘The deadline is coming up and we are going to be putting forward some  sort of draft Bill.’ But the Prime Minister has made it clear he would not be letting prisoners get the vote. He said told the Commons last month: 'I do not want prisoners to have the vote, and they should not get the vote - I am very clear about that. 'If it helps to have another vote in Parliament on another resolution to make it absolutely clear and help put the legal position beyond doubt, I am happy to do that. 'But no one should be in any doubt: prisoners are not getting the vote under this Government.' 'Sickening': Prime Minister David Cameron has said the idea of prisoners voting makes him feel sick and he wants to retain the status quo . Last February, the Commons called by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22 for the blanket ban to be maintained. There is a risk that this week's Commons vote could set up another clash with the ECHR, who could fine the Government if it does not comply with its ruling. Attorney General Dominic Grieve has warned against defying the Strasbourg court, saying it's ruling imposes an international legal obligation on the UK. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has said Parliament has the right in law to tell the ECHR that it does not accept its ruling. But added there would be 'consequences' for the UK's position in Europe if MPs do chose to defy the judgment. In 2005, the ECRH said it was up to individual countries to decide which prisoners should be denied the right to vote from jail, but that a total ban was illegal.

One-year-old Neapolitan mastiff Flo had so much excess skin on her forehead she struggled to see and developed an infection in her eyes. The stray pooch's wrinkled look resulted in her developing cherry eye disease, an infection that she was genetically predisposed to. Animal rescuers found the pooch on the streets after she was abandoned by her owners - who they believe could not afford to treat her. Before: One-year-old mastiff Flo suffered from cherry eye disease as her droopy skin caused her to get infection in her eye . After: Flo's sight was saved by a £1,000 facelift, seen here recovering from surgery . But Flo's eyesight has now been saved thanks a £1,000 facelift which involved lifting the skin around hers eyes to clear the infection. Flo, who is being cared for by Happy Endings Rescue in Faversham, Kent, is now looking for a new home. The charity are willing to let her go for free even though the prized pet would have cost £1,000 to buy as a pup. Pain: Flo struggled to see before her surgery (pictured), but is now recovering and looking for a new home . Breeding: Cherry eye is a genetic condition which is hard to prevent, which could be why Flo's breeders do not want her back . The popularity of pet plastic surgery is on the rise in the UK. UK insurance company Petplan produced numbers based on claims made by British pet owners in 2010. Not only was there a jump in nose jobs by 25 per cent over three years, but more than £1million was also invested in eyelifts, says PetPlan. On top of that, figures show that in 2010 Briton's spent £1.6million on pet plastic surgery. Procedures range from artificial nails to nose jobs to testicular implants on neutered animals. Happy Endings founder Chris Johns said: 'Flo was a stray. She was in a really bad way. 'I think her owner could not afford her treatment. She was microchipped to her breeder. But the breeder does not want her back. 'I don't know why people breed dogs like this if they do not want to care for them. She is feeling much better now she can see. 'The vet cut in to her brow and pulled her eye lids up. If that doesn't work then she will have to go back for a full face lift. Cherry eye is a disorder of the nictitating membrane, also called the third eyelid, present in the eyes of dogs and cats but it is most often seen in young dogs of various breeds under the age of two. It is considered a genetic problem and little is known about how to prevent it. This means that dogs with the condition should not be used for breeding. Mr Johns added: 'She is being cared for in a foster home, but will need a permanent home once she is better. 'We currently face vet bills in the region of £12,000 for all our animals. We are trying to raise the money needed to bring these bills down.'","One-year-old Flo had too much skin drooping over her eyes .

Payback: Gladys Popoola has been ordered to repay £300,000 after claiming so many fraudulent benefits that she could buy three homes in London . A benefits cheat who raked in so much cash she bought three homes in London and one in her native Kenya has been ordered to repay £300,000. Gladys Popoola claimed the 'full range' of benefits, despite the fact that she had three jobs and her husband worked – building up a half million pound property portfolio. The 47-year-old admitted 16 counts relating to fraud at Southwark Crown Court and was jailed for 24 months last year. Her six-year web of deceit started as soon as she was granted leave to remain in Britain in 2004. She began applying for the full range of welfare, including income support and housing and council tax benefits, despite the fact her husband, John Ndirangu, had a job. Mother-of-one Popoola duped the authorities into giving her two National Insurance numbers, one in her real name and the other in her maiden name, so she could work and claim at the same time. When she was caught in 2011, she worked three jobs - two in housing groups and one at the Hammersmith and Fulham council – but still claimed Jobseeker's Allowance. In that time, she bought properties in Cricklewood, Forest Gate and Clapton – and even one in Kenya. The fraudster also claimed legal aid in civil proceedings against her last year and made money by renting out her London homes. Popoola, of north west London, was jailed for two years in March 2012 after admitting 13 counts of benefit fraud and three other counts of fraud relating to obtaining a national insurance number. She has already been released on licence after serving less than half of her sentence. Hiding: Gladys Popoola, pictured here outside Southwark Crown Court (centre), began illegally claiming benefits when she was allowed to stay in the UK in 2004 . David . Jugnarain, prosecuting, said her fraud also included an application to . the government for maternity pay, despite the fact she was already . receiving it. He said at the original court case: ‘The value of the fraud in this case is just in excess of £200,000 .’ In addition, she falsely claimed legal aid when she was sacked from the council, when they realised she working another job despite the fact she was signed off sick. Today Popoola was ordered to repay a total of £304,079, including £186,000 compensation to Westminster City Council and HMRC, within six months. The cash will be taken from her assets which are holed up in her three UK properties. Portfolio: Earlham Road in Forest Gate, where mother-of-one Popoola had bought property .

Disgraced minister Chris Huhne will stay out of prison for at least another week after Vicky Pryce's trial collapsed yesterday. The Liberal Democrat is almost certain to go to jail but cannot be sentenced until a jury decides if his ex-wife perverted the course of justice by taking his speeding points. On the first day of their trial on February 4 Huhne caused gasps of disbelief after he finally admitted the crime after years of telling ‘anyone who would listen’ - including the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister - that he was innocent. Pryce also admits taking the points for her former husband but denies the charge claiming he forced her to do it. Tense: Vicky Pryce arrives at Southwark Crown Court yesterday before the jury could not give a verdict so her ex-husband Chris Huhne will have to wait at least another week to hear his sentence . Huhne has been waiting to hear his fate for nearly three weeks, and is expected to be given between six and 12 months in prison. The judge in Pryce's case was forced to dismiss the 12 jurors yesterday afternoon after expressing grave concerns that they had not understood the case or their job. Mr Justice Sweeney said the group had demonstrated ‘absolutely fundamental deficits in understanding’. There will now be a retrial starting on Monday, with a new jury, which is expected to last five days. The collapsed trial lasted twice as long, but experts believe the new one will be much quicker as many legal arguments will not have to be repeated again. After their verdict Chris Huhne will be called back to court within 24 hours and then sentenced. The judge yesterday spoke out after the jury sent him an extraordinary list of ten questions about key aspects of this relatively simple case, which they did not understand, and said they were ‘highly unlikely’ to reach a verdict. Jurors had reached a stalemate over the allegation that Pryce, 60, perverted the course of justice by taking her then-husband Huhne’s speeding points a decade ago. A court sketch shows Vicky Price standing in the dock as she is told she will have to face a re-trial . Affair: Huhne left Pryce for his aide Carina Trimingham, right, who accompanied him to court when he changed his plea to guilty . Pryce, a former government economist, admitted taking the points but argued she was forced into it because of ‘marital coercion’. A retired lord chief justice and a former director of public prosecutions (DPP) have called for greater research into juries following the collapse of the Vicky Pryce trial. The ex-wife of former minister Chris Huhne faces a retrial after a jury described as suffering 'absolutely fundamental deficits in understanding' failed to reach a verdict in her case. Former DPP Lord Macdonald of River Glaven (above) told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We perhaps ought to allow a bit more access to jury reasoning than we do. 'I think it is impossible for researchers to conduct any kind of examination at any time into what has gone on in jury rooms. In other jurisdictions under controlled conditions researchers are allowed to question jurors, to come to some conclusions about the way they are deliberating and how the process works. 'If you have a better understanding of that then perhaps it's easier to frame directions to juries that they will follow and understand. 'I don't believe this is a general problem but I do think we should allow a bit more research into the way juries go about their tasks.' Former lord chief justice Lord Woolf told Today: 'I wouldn't rush into doing anything, I would think about it. If there was anything that might help us to be reassured about the jury, Lord Macdonald's put his finger on it. 'Some very carefully organised, responsible research may be a good thing, but it would have to be treated with great care.' The eight women and four men retired on Thursday but remained deadlocked, even after they were told the court would accept a majority decision agreed by at least ten of them. Their list of questions included: ‘Can a juror come to a verdict based on a reason that was not presented in court and has no facts or evidence to support it, either from the prosecution or defence?’ The question flew in the face of the jury’s oath – sworn by every juror in every trial in Britain – to try the case solely on the basis of the evidence presented in court. Another question asked if ‘religious conviction’ was a satisfactory reason for a wife to obey her husband, because it was included in her wedding vows. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said the jurors had shown an ‘unparalleled’ failure to understand ‘very basic concepts of jury trials’. He told the court: ‘This is a jury which hasn’t, it appears, understood its function.’ He added: ‘I don’t recollect getting to this stage in any trial – even far more complicated trials than this – and after two days of deliberation getting a list of questions of this very basic kind, illustrating that at least some of the jurors don’t appear to have grasped it.’ Jurors were asked to decide if Huhne, the former Energy Secretary and MP for Eastleigh, had bullied his ex-wife into taking his speeding points in 2003. The case hinged on the comparatively straightforward question of whether the jury believed she had no choice but to accept. The judge gave the jury lengthy . written guidance about the meaning of marital coercion, and said the . prosecution had to prove its case ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. Despite those directions, the list of . jurors’ questions included requests for definitions of both marital . coercion and reasonable doubt. Swift exit: Vicky Pryce leaves Southwark Crown Court today after the jury failed to reach a verdict over her perversion of justice trial . Satisfied smile: Vicky Pryce faces a retrial over perverting the course of justice by helping her ex-husband Chris Huhne dodge a driving ban in 2003 . Mr Justice Sweeney responded: ‘A . reasonable doubt is a doubt which is reasonable. These are ordinary . English words that the law doesn’t allow me to help you with.’ Their questions were handed to the . judge on Tuesday but could not be reported until he decided if the jury . should be discharged on the basis they had not understood the case. He ruled they should be . given further instructions in the hope they could continue and . eventually reach a verdict, without the need for a costly retrial. They . couldn’t. Wakling tall: The jury of eight women and four men at Southwark Crown Court had been deliberating for four days but still failed to produce a verdict . Media scrum: Vicky Pryce was surrounded by photographers as she arrived at Southwark Crown Court today . The judge told the court: ‘After well . over 30 years of criminal trials I have never come across this at this . stage [of a trial]. Never.’ Pryce, of Clapham, South London, showed little emotion as the judge discharged the jury. Huhne, 58, who has already pleaded guilty, will not be sentenced until his ex-wife’s retrial has finished. The politician has been told to be . under ‘no illusions’ that he faces a jail term as he joins the ranks of . disgraced MPs alongside Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aitken. Of the eight women and four men on the Vicky Pryce jury, only two were white - the rest appeared to be of Afro-Caribbean or Asian origin. At least twice, the court finished 30 minutes early because a jury member had a 'religious observance' to keep. Despite their visibly different backgrounds, none of the 12 appeared to struggle with the English language while reading the oath at the beginning of the trial at Southwark Crown Court. However, inability to understand written English is not a bar to serving on a jury. The 200,000 people a year called for jury service receive letters printed in eight languages to 'encourage' non-English speakers. It was noted during the Pryce case that many of the jurors were dressed casually. The woman selected by the jury to be their foreman was well dressed but she was in the minority. It was she who eventually passed a note to the judge saying the jury were 'highly unlikely' to reach a verdict. The words 'highly unlikely' were underlined twice. The allegations date back to 2003 . when Huhne was caught speeding and thought he would lose his licence, . jeopardising his chances of being nominated as the Lib Dem candidate for . Eastleigh, Hampshire. He went on to win the seat, despite . an eventual driving ban later that year after he was caught talking on . his mobile phone while driving. Pryce claims he forced her to take the . points and said he put his political career first throughout their . 26-year marriage, while she was forced to compromise her own successful . career. The mother of five told the court he . had demanded she have an abortion in 1990 because it would be bad for . his political ambitions. She said he had also tried to bully . her into aborting a pregnancy two years later – a pregnancy that . ultimately gave the couple their son Peter. Huhne left Pryce in June . 2010 after confessing to an 18-month affair with his aide Carina . Trimingham. Pryce told the court he also had a second secret mistress. The court heard Pryce spent months . trying to reveal the points-swapping episode to the Press so she could . ‘nail’ Huhne, and the story broke in May 2011 in two Sunday newspapers. The warring couple were both charged with perverting the course of justice in February last year. Huhne stepped down from his post in the coalition Cabinet, vowing to fight the charge and clear his name. But when his lawyers failed to get the case thrown out, he changed his plea on the first day of the trial and resigned as an MP.

People who have difficulty sleeping may be showing early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, a new study has warned. Researchers found sleep is disrupted in people who are likely have early Alzheimer's disease but do not yet have the memory loss or other cognitive problems characteristic of the full-blown disease. The finding confirms earlier observations by some of the same researchers. Those studies showed a link in mice between sleep loss and brain plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Sleep problems can be an earlier indicator of Alzheimer's disease than symptoms such as memory loss . Early evidence tentatively suggests the connection may work in both directions: Alzheimer's plaques disrupt sleep, and lack of sleep promotes Alzheimer's plaques. Senior author Professor David Holtzman, head of Washington University's Department of Neurology in the U.S., said: 'This link may provide us with an easily detectable sign of Alzheimer's pathology. 'As we start to treat people who have markers of early Alzheimer's, changes in sleep in response to treatments may serve as an indicator of whether the new treatments are succeeding."" Sleep problems are common in people who have symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, but scientists recently have begun to suspect that they also may be an indicator of early disease. The new paper is among the first to connect early Alzheimer's disease and sleep disruption in humans. For the new study, researchers recruited 145 volunteers from the University's Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre. Previous research has shown a link between sleep loss and brain plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease . All of the volunteers were 45 to 75-years-old and cognitively normal when they enrolled. As a part of other research at the centre, scientists had already analysed samples of the volunteers' spinal fluids for markers of Alzheimer's disease. The samples showed that 32 participants had preclinical Alzheimer's disease, meaning they were likely to have amyloid plaques present in their brains but were not yet cognitively impaired. Participants kept daily sleep diaries for two weeks, noting the time they went to bed and got up, the number of naps taken on the previous day, and other sleep-related information. The researchers tracked the participants' activity levels using sensors worn on the wrist that detected the wearer's movements. Lead study author Doctor Yo-El Ju, assistant professor of neurology, said: 'Most people don't move when they're asleep, and we developed a way to use the data we collected as a marker for whether a person was asleep or awake. 'This let us assess sleep efficiency, which is a measure of how much time in bed is spent asleep.' Participants who had preclinical Alzheimer's disease had poorer sleep efficiency (80.4 per cent) than people without markers of Alzheimer's (83.7 per cent). On average, those with preclinical disease were in bed as long as other participants, but they spent less time asleep. They also napped more often. Dr Ju added: 'When we looked specifically at the worst sleepers, those with a sleep efficiency lower than 75 per cent, they were more than five times more likely to have preclinical Alzheimer's disease than good sleepers.' Now Dr Ju and her colleagues are following up with studies in younger participants who have sleep disorders . She said: 'We think this may help us get a better feel for the way this connection flows - does sleep loss drive Alzheimer's, does Alzheimer's lead to sleep loss, or is it a combination? 'That will help us determine whether we can change the course of disease with pharmaceuticals or other treatments.' The findings were published in the journal Neurology.","Sleep problems can be an earlier indicator of the disease than memory loss .

Does the man who took one of the steepest, most public falls from grace in recent sports history have a new career path in the works? Possibly, but judging from his trepidation about playing the drums for an Austin, Texas audience of 10,000 people, disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong won’t be moving on to the music world any time soon. The founder of the Livestrong Foundation took to Twitter to tell what fans he has left what it felt like to play the drums at a recent reggae festival in his hometown. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New gig? Lance Armstrong may have gotten a new job, for one night anyway, when he played drums for a reggae group in Austin, Texas . ‘Helluva good time sitting in with @LanceHerbstrong 2night @AustinReggae,’ Armstrong tweeted April 20. To clarify, Armstrong shared the stage that night with a reggae group that cribbed its name from the former Tour de France champ, known as Lance Herbstrong. ‘Drumming in front of 10,000 peeps had me more than a little freaked,’ he went on to tell his nearly 4 million followers. The New York Daily News reports Armstrong played four songs with the playfully named group, including Musical Youth's 1982 hit ‘Pass the Dutchie.’ Armstrong’s dance card, or drum card, . rather, is likely quite empty these days compared to the hectic schedule . he once kept as a successful businessman and the world’s foremost . cyclist. Once a common . sight on magazine covers and the Hollywood social scene, the cancer . survivor has kept a low profile since his tell-all interview with Oprah . Winfrey last January in which he admitted to using performance enhancing . drugs to help him win all seven of his Tour de France championships. Nervous: Armstrong appeared jittery before his performance to a crowd of 10,000 and tweeted his apprehensions . Relief: Before long, though, the fallen champion looked very comfortable in his unlikely new role . Since then, the former athlete’s name has mainly been tied to negative media headlines. Facing several multi-million dollar lawsuits, many speculated Armstrong’s April sale of his 7,850-square-foot mansion in Austin was at least partially a bid to defer mounting legal costs. Also this month, Armstrong, who is banned for life from competing in any Olympic sport, was preparing to race in a swimming competition that did not test its entrants for performance enhancing drugs. Upon learning of Armstrong’s intention, the International Swimming Federation banned him from the event and from all future events that lay within their purview. Competitive sports, it seems, are not likely to be part of Armstrong’s future. So, perhaps a new life as a reggae drummer is a smart choice for Armstrong, if a rather odd one.",The disgraced athlete played drums on four songs at an April 20 Austin reggae festival with a group called Lance Herbstrong .

A professor at a top British university has called for a decriminalisation of growing cannabis, saying six plants per person is an ‘acceptable amount’. Alex Stevens, an expert on criminal justice at the University of Kent, said possession of the drug and cultivating cannabis plants for personal use, should not be a criminal offence. He said he did not want to harm people for ‘things they are going to do anyway’. Legalise it: Professor Alex Stevens at the University of Kent said six cannabis plants per person for anyone over 18 in the UK is 'acceptable' Professor Stevens also gave advice to students on using cannabis saying they need to inform themselves and be careful prior to taking the drug due to legal consequences. The deputy head of the University of Kent . at Medway’s School of Social Policy, Sociology and Social Research . refuted a ‘commercialisation’ of the drug and said he would not want to . see advertisements for cannabis if it was legalised. ‘We should be moving towards progressive decriminalisation. We should be seeking to reform our drug laws to make them less harmful,’ Professor Stevens said in an interview with student paper The Medwire. ‘One way of doing that would be to start by decriminalising the personal possession of cannabis and also the production of small amounts of cannabis in people’s own homes.’ Good growth: An industrial sized Cannabis plant seized in Ireland earlier this week .

Police in Paris discovered two boys living in squalid conditions in an unlit cellar while the rest of their family lived in comparative luxury upstairs, it emerged today. The boys, named as Damien, 12, and Hugo, 10, by authorities, had been forced to sleep on bare mattresses surrounded by their own filth for the past three years while their father, 39, step-mother, 44, and her seven-year-old son lived upstairs. They were allowed out to attend the local state school in the day, but at night were locked into the cellar which had no natural light, electricity or toilet, and was never cleaned.  They were often beaten with a belt by their father, it is alleged, and forced to go without food. French television news says this is the house in the quiet suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis where the family lived . The shocking conditions the children lived in became apparent last Wednesday night when the older boy, Damien, escaped and ran to the local police station in Bondy, Seine-Saint-Denis, to the north-east of Paris. He told officers about the conditions he and his brother lived in, and officers went to their house in the suburb to see for themselves. Deve Maboungou, of UNSA police, said: 'When the police arrived they found a mattress and excrement - it was just as the boy had said.' Officers found the boys had 'scratches and burst blood vessels on their arms', according to Nord Eclair. The source added: 'They slept on mattresses on the floor, without sheets, in the middle of their own mess' in the cellar which was 'in an advanced state of decay'. A source said the boys' mistreatment began when their drug-addict mother moved out and their father moved in with another woman who had two sons, now aged seven and 17. The older boy is said to be a 'petit rat' student dancer at the Opera de Paris, which is looking after him, the Daily Telegraph reports.  It says the seven-year-old lived a very different life, attending private school and sleeping upstairs with the two adults. Deve Maboungou, of the UNSA Police Syndicate, said officers found the boys living in their own excrement . Neighbours in the quiet suburban street said they never saw the children playing outside . The boys' living conditions were only discovered last week after the elder boy escaped and ran to the police station . 'There appears to have been a law of silence in the family over the other boys' treatment.  Nobody was supposedly aware of anything amiss,' a source said. When the father, a plumber, was questioned about the conditions his children lived in, he told authorities they were 'unmanageable and broke everything'.  He also admitted sometimes with-holding food from them. The father and stepmother are now in custody. A . spokesman for the Tribunal de Grande Instance court in Paris told . MailOnline: 'The father has been charged with habitual violence against a . minor, with-holding food and care, and violence by an older carer . against a minor. 'The step-mother has been charged with with-holding food and care, and violence by an older carer against a minor.' He said the case dossier was now with an examining magistrate who would lead the enquiry. The boys were checked by a paediatrician before being placed in a foster home. Neighbours . said they had never suspected a thing: 'It was always very quiet . there', one said. 'You never saw them playing in the street.' Police in Seine-Saint-Denis heard the boys had been sleeping in the cellar for more than three years . Josef Fritzl is serving life in jail after imprisoning his daughter in his basement and raping her repeatedy for 24 years . Josef Fritzl is currently serving a life sentence in Austria after being convicted of imprisoning his daughter, Elisabeth, for 24 years. Fritzl, now 78, lured his daughter, then 18, into the basement of their family home in Amstetten, Austria, in 1984.  He then forced her to write a letter claiming she had run away, and gave it to police after reporting his daughter missing. While she was entombed under the house, Elisabeth was raped repeatedly by her father, and gave birth to seven children.  She also suffered one miscarriage. One of Elisabeth's children died shortly after birth, three were removed to live upstairs with Josef and his wife Rosemarie, and three stayed underground with Elisabeth. Fritzl threatened his daughter that she and her three children downstairs would be gassed if they tried to escape.  He also said they would be electrocuted if they meddled with the door. When Elisabeth's incestuously-conceived daughter Kerstil fell seriously ill with kidney failure in April 2008, Elisabeth persuaded her father to take the 19-year-old to hospital.  Fritzl's lies were uncovered, police intervened, and Elisabeth and her children were finally free to leave the basement.","Police say the boys, named as Damien and Hugo, were locked into squalid cellar without light, electricity or toilet .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:13 EST, 15 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:39 EST, 15 January 2013 . George P Bush is proving his famous political family name still can persuade donors to open their checkbooks in a big way. He raised more than $1.3 million in barely eight weeks since announcing he will run for office in Texas - even though exactly what post he will seek remains unclear. The grandson of one former president and nephew of another, Bush raked in $1,350,489 in the 39 business days between November 7 and December 31, according to his campaign manager, Trey Newton on Monday. Political clout: George P. Bush has raised $1.8milllion in funds since announcing he will run for office in Texas . Bush's first contribution came from his father, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush for $50,000, while his uncle George W Bush also contributed $50,000. In all, there were 449 donations from 29 states, with an average value of a bit more than $3,000. Some 65 per cent of Bush's contributions came from Texas, while donations in Florida accounted for 26 per cent. An additional 9 per cent came from the rest of the country. Bush has spent the last several weeks crisscrossing Texas and the country, raising money and meeting with supporters and GOP leaders. A December fundraiser in Washington featured some top attendees with ties to the George W. Bush White House and to longtime Republican kingmaker Karl Rove. Newton said Bush got $45,000 from Houston homebuilder Bob Perry, a Texas GOP mega-donor. He got another $20,000 from Perry's wife, Doylene. Family values: Uncle George W gave his nephew George P a sweet $50,000 towards his political campaign . Big spender: Former president George W Bush, pictured with his father George HW, donated to the latest member of their political dynasty George P Bush . Harold Simmons, a billionaire Texas businessman and heavyweight donor who has given millions to Republicans nationwide, contributed $50,000, while energy mogul Clayton Williams gave $25,000. Bush's first campaign finance report is due today but Newton offered a preview of the completed report before it is submitted. Bush became the family's latest scion to gravitate toward public office on November 7, when he filed a candidate reporting declaration with the Texas Ethics Commission. He has not said which office he will seek, but Bush said in an interview last Friday that he was leaning toward land commissioner. Bush also said, however, that he wouldn't announce his final decision until this summer, after the Texas Legislature finishes its session and fellow Republican and Governor Rick Perry announces whether he will seek another term next year. Some have speculated that Bush could challenge Perry for governor - and even if he doesn't, what Perry decides will trigger political dominoes falling. Current Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson plans to run for lieutenant governor in 2014, creating a vacancy in his office. But Attorney General Greg Abbott, also a Republican, may himself run for governor next year, meaning his post could be open too. Proud parents: George P Bush's mother and father, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and wife Columba . A 36-year-old attorney from Fort Worth, Bush says he's willing to wait his turn politically rather than immediately seek top positions coveted by other Texas Republicans. Land commissioner can be a stepping stone to higher office; Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst served in the post before winning his current job. Still, Newton said no statewide officeholders gave Bush money, with no donations coming from Perry, Abbott or others. Last month, Jeb Bush sent a letter to Florida donors saying his son was considering running for land commissioner in Texas. Newton said Monday that the 'bulk of Florida money is because of the governor's efforts'. He added that Bush has been able to raise money nationally because of his work with a number of political action committees that has had him traveling the country for months. Bush's candidacy has been cheered by Republicans throughout Texas who see him as a way to improve the party's standing among Hispanic voters. Bush is a Spanish-speaker whose mother was born in Mexico. A Democrat has not won statewide office in Texas since 1994, but Hispanics tend to vote overwhelmingly Democratic and accounted for two-thirds of Texas' population growth over the last decade. Mitt Romney's failure to connect with Latinos is being cited as a reason for his defeat by President Obama, who carried 71 per cent of the Hispanic vote nationwide.","Nephew of George W Bush and grandson of George HW Bush .

Nasa has developed a 'perfect' amplifier which uses hi-tech superconducting technologies to amplify the faint signals we hear from space. The device will be an 'ear to the universe' which will allow us to study stars, galaxies and . black holes - as well as exploring the 'quantum' world inside the atom. ‘This amplifier will redefine what it is possible to measure,’ said . Jonas Zmuidzinas, at Nasa's JPL. All the way up to 11: Nasa has developed a nearly perfect amplifiier, which will be used for everything from studying stars, galaxies and black holes to exploring the quantum world and developing quantum computers . Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, both in Pasadena, have developed a new type of amplifier for boosting electrical signals. An amplifier is a device that increases the strength of a weak signal. ‘Amplifiers play a basic role in a wide range of scientific measurements and in electronics in general,’ said Peter Day, a principal scientist at JPL and a visiting associate in physics at Caltech. ‘For many tasks, current amplifiers are good enough. But for the most demanding applications, the shortcomings of the available technologies limit us.’ One of the key features of the new amplifier is that it incorporates superconductors—materials that allow an electric current to flow with zero resistance when lowered to certain temperatures. For their amplifier, the researchers are using titanium nitride and niobium titanium nitride, which have just the right properties to allow the pump signal to amplify the weak signal. Although the amplifier has a host of potential applications, the reason the researchers built the device was to help them study the universe. The team built the instrument to boost microwave signals, but the new design can be used to build amplifiers that help astronomers observe in a wide range of wavelengths, from radio waves to X-rays. ‘It's hard to predict what all of the applications are going to end up being, but a nearly perfect amplifier is a pretty handy thing to have in your bag of tricks,’ Zmuidzinas said. And by creating their new device, the researchers have shown that it is indeed possible to build an essentially perfect amplifier. ‘Our instrument still has a few rough edges that need polishing before we would call it perfect, but we think our results so far show that we can get there.’ The team recently described the new instrument in the journal Nature Physics. .","Device built of superconducting coil of wire .

AT 12 MILES: Runners will pass The Kings Arms on Tooley Street just before crossing Tower Bridge. The pub will hold a champagne breakfast from 9am and have live music throughout the day . AT 17 MILES: As athletes make their way round the Isle of Dogs, The Lord Nelson pub on Manchester Road, will have a party atmosphere where spectators can cheer the runners on while enjoying a burger . AT THE FINISH: One of the closest pubs to the finish for weary runners to have a pint and toast their achievement is the Red Lion on Parliament Street . The iconic landmark of Tower Bridge is a welcome sight for runners as it means they are nearly at the halfway mark. Arrive early to grab a space to watch the action here as it is often one of the most popular spots on the course. As the route heads out to Canary Wharf and then turns back on itself, people in pole position near the Tower of London will be able to watch athletes coming over Tower Bridge and then see them again as they pass on East Smithfield at the 22 mile mark and then on to Lower Thames Street. TWO BITES OF THE CHERRY . Spectators positioned along the Highway between miles 13 and 14 will also see the runners running out and then back again. TO SPOT MO FARAH FINISH HIS HALF MARATHON . Position yourself at the 13.1 mile mark if you want to see Farah finishing his half. FOR ENTERTAINMENT . Canary Wharf is another of the best places to soak up the atmosphere as bands line the route by the landmark. As the runners enter the Isle of Dogs at mile 15 and then snake their way round the base of Canary Wharf, there are multiple options to cheer your friend or family member at more than one spot without having to travel far yourself. AVOID THE CROWDS . For those who want a spot with less . crowds, take the Docklands to Blackwall or Limehouse stations as the . runners pass at 20 to 21 miles.

Chief superintendent Julia Pendry from Scotland Yard confirmed the number of officers on the streets will be increased by 40 per cent 'for reassurance' and so 'people who come to London on Sunday feel safe when they are in the city'. The police are urging spectators to be extra vigilant and not to leave their bags unattended. Mo Farah said he has no worries about taking part despite Monday's events. 'This . is home for me. This is where I grew up and there's no reason not to do . this,' he said. Stand out in the crowd: A number will take part in fancy dress to raise money for charity . Safety concerns: An extra police presence has been promised to 'reassure' people after Monday's events in Boston . The last three miles of the race passes along the Embankment, turning right at Big Ben into Birdcage Walk and then past Buckingham Palace into The Mall to finish. Arrive early to get a good spot on these stretches as the crowds can often become three deep. Blackfriars and Waterloo Bridges are places to get an elevated view of the action. The grand stand seating on The Mall is restricted to those with tickets - usually given to those supporting charity runners and places are allocated in advance. Those who can't make it into London or want to watch from the comfort of their sofa can follow the BBC's five-and-a-half hour coverage starting at 8.30am. They will also have live streaming on their website. The London Marathon website will also have live updates on the day and on their Twitter feed.

Pat Moule, 69, slimmed down from 16 stone nine pounds after surgeons told her she was ‘too fat’ to have a transplant operation for David, 72. The retired couple, who have been married for nearly 50 years, were devastated when doctors told them Mr Moule’s failing kidneys were functioning at just 12 per cent. Compatible: Pat and David Moule are as much in love as they were on their wedding day nearly 50 years ago (right) When they broke the news a year ago, Mrs Moule couldn’t walk up the stairs without getting out of breath and was told she was too overweight to undergo the vital op. Determined to help her husband, Pat managed to shed the extra pounds and passed stringent tests marking her out as a compatible donor. Mrs Moule, from Southampton, Hampshire, said: 'When you love someone as much as I love David it really isn’t a big decision to make. 'I am just so grateful that I am compatible enough with him to do it. 'We have been through a lot together and sometimes there are things that drive couples apart and then there are things that pull you closer together. That is what love is all about.' The thought of losing her ‘best friend’, spurred Mrs Moule on to join Slimming World and buy an exercise bike. This new diet and fitness regime helped the five foot eight inch tall retired personnel manager shrink from a size 26 to a size 14. Pat before she joined Slimming World: She dropped five stone so she could have transplant surgery . At 11 stone five pounds, she is a shadow of her former self and is counting the days until the transplant surgery - which carries a one-in-3,000 risk of death. Mrs Moule said: 'David is my best friend as well as my husband and I honestly cannot imagine not having him with me. Devoted: Mrs Moule said 'I would not want to be here without him' 'I would not want to be here without him and I know that by losing this weight it will make my life better as well. 'We will be able to do so much more.' Mr Moule, a retired research engineer, was first diagnosed with kidney disease more than 20 years ago. He now suffers from End Stage kidney failure, a deteriorating condition that has no cure. Mrs Moule said: 'When we were first told we thought that was it, all over. David’s condition affects everything - he gets very tired and only has to be active for about five minutes before he has to rest. 'But we were told it was only ever going to get worse. 'The hospital mentioned a transplant and asked if there was anyone in the family who could help. 'I immediately wanted to help but the fact was I was obese. The doctor took one look at me and said ""No, you are too fat.£' Mr Moule, a retired research engineer, says he has mixed feelings about his wife’s sacrifice. He added: 'For me there are mixed feelings, especially about putting Pat through this but I can see how this can make our life a lot better. 'The reality is I am only going to get worse. 'My fear is if it doesn’t work Pat will have gone through all of this for nothing.' Mrs Moule is more optimistic. 'I am not thinking about it not working,' she said. 'If I don’t do this I would always think ‘what if?’ for the rest of my life. 'At least I will know I have done everything I can do. He is everything to me.' The couple are still waiting for a date for surgery.","Couple have been married for nearly 50 years .

Instead the 21-year-old is preparing for fiance Nick Czerwinski's funeral after he died from a heart condition just three days before their big day. Although the pair were due to wed in hospital, Sarah says that Nick's death has come as a real shock. Sarah, who lived with Nick in Plymouth, Devon, said: 'He was so laid back, you never knew there was anything wrong with him. Tragic: Nick (left) died of cardiomyopathy just three days before he was due to marry fiancee Sarah . 'He never complained. We did not realise how many friends he had until he passed away. We wanted to get married so I would have his last name, the same surname as our daughter.' Sarah's sister Becky, 18, added: 'He was always cheering everyone else up, when we should have been cheering him up.'

Heartbroken: Sarah has been left to bring up daughter Leila alone and is struggling to pay for Nick's funeral . Nick was born with cardiomyopathy, a heart disease which led to an irregular heartbeat. He attended Estover Community College and City College Plymouth, where he studied catering and was also where he met Sarah. She said: 'He loved his food, he used to plan his day around his meals. They were one of the few things he could enjoy in the end.' Nick was also a keen Plymouth Argyle fan and used to have a season ticket at Home Park. Nick spent several months last year at Harefield Hospital in Middlesex, but when the couple planned to marry on April 12 they were looking forward to a future together. Nick died from bleeding on the brain as a side-effect of his heart problems on April 9, just weeks after going on the transplant list for a new heart. She added: 'Myself and all my family have now gone on the register for organ donations.

A Scottish couple were convicted last night of killing their 16-month-old son by giving him methadone and an anti-depressant. Corinna Reid, 37, was cleared of homicide but found guilty of the manslaughter of her toddler Aiden. Her former partner, and the child’s father, Robert Cormack, was also cleared of homicide but convicted of manslaughter. Guilty: Corinna Reid, 37, and Robert Cormack, 42, from Edinburgh were cleared of homicide but found guilty of the manslaughter of toddler Aiden by giving him methadone and an anti-depressant . Tragic: The couple, recovering drug addicts, had faced up to 14 years in jail if found guilty of the youngster¿s homicide in a hotel room in Tenerife during a holiday . The couple, recovering drug addicts, . had faced up to 14 years in jail if found guilty of the youngster’s . homicide in a hotel room in Tenerife during a holiday. They . can expect to be jailed for between one and four years. State . prosecutor Jaime Serrano asked judge Jose Felix Mota to jail the couple, . from Edinburgh, for two and a half years. Their . defence lawyers asked him to consider a maximum sentence of six months, . taking into account mitigating circumstances including the couple’s . drug dependency when Aiden died. Decision: Corinna Reid & current boyfriend arrive at the court in Spain . Verdict: Robert Cormack, wearing a grey suit, arrives at court before the verdict following the 2007 death . They were bailed until sentencing, expected to be announced in a month’s time. Both declined to comment. Robert’s . lawyer Mari Angeles Conde said: ‘It’s very unlikely either of them will . be ordered to return to jail to serve any more prison time given the . time they have already been held in custody.’ The . jury reached its majority 8-1 verdict only hours after the pair had . appeared at the Provincial Law Court in the island’s capital, Santa . Cruz. They determined that Reid and Cormack had consciously given the infant methadone and the anti-depressant Diazepam. Tragic: 16-month-old Aiden's death in the popular resort of Adeje on the Canary Island was originally blamed on bronchitis . But the nine-member jury unanimously ruled that they could not have been aware of the lethal consequences of the mix of Aiden’s bronchitis and the drugs he had consumed. The toddler died in January 2007 at the family’s holiday hotel in Adeje, southern Tenerife. His death was blamed on bronchitis but tests revealed traces of the heroin substitute methadone and tranquiliser Diazepam in his body. Reid, a mother-of-three, and her then boyfriend, Cormack, 42, were arrested and extradited to Tenerife two years later. 'Corinna and I have lost everything. To suggest we intentionally harmed our child is ridiculous' Robert Cormack in court . It was only then Cormack confessed the youngster might have drunk some of his orange juice laced with methadone. Spanish authorities dismissed their claims it was an accident and insisted the couple drugged him on purpose. Earlier Reid had told the court: ‘I didn’t give anything to Aiden. When Robert told me it was an accident, I know he’s telling me the truth. He would never have knowingly killed Aiden.’ She added: ‘I thought Aiden had died of complications from flu and a virus that had affected his breathing.’ Cormack, who was involved in an altercation with a photographer outside the court, insisted: ‘The police suggested we wanted to subdue Aiden with the drugs so we could drink alcohol. ‘Every minute we spent with Aiden was a joy. ‘Corinna and I have lost everything. To suggest we intentionally harmed our child is ridiculous.’ Mr Serrano told jurors Aiden died after the pair ‘consciously’ gave their son the drugs to sedate him so they could get a proper night’s sleep. Reid’s defence lawyer, Christian Mesia, described the mother as a ‘victim’. He added: ‘To this day we still don’t have a cause of death for Aiden and that’s because of the botched investigation.’ Cormack’s defence lawyer, Mari Angeles Conde, told the jury: ‘He didn’t want to kill his son.‘Was he negligent? Possibly, yes, but that doesn’t mean he meant to kill his son.’","Corrina Reid and Robert Cormack were found guilty of manslaughter .

Frustrated: Ambulance technician Victor Brushette, 59, has been unable to claim compensation after being hit by an illegal quad bike rider . An ambulance worker has been told he cannot get compensation because when he was knocked down by a quad biker it was not intentional. Victor Brushette, 59, was left in a coma for a week when he was hit by the farm vehicle being driven by James Lewis, 28. At the time of the collision Mr Burshette was diverting traffic around an earlier accident. Lewis, who has 20 previous convictions, knocked him down causing him to suffer a punctured lung, eight fractured ribs, and a broken shoulder. He also suffered such bad leg injuries that he faced the prospect of having one amputated. The collision happened in Southend, Essex, in May 2010 and Lewis was driving at up to 60mph. He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and causing grievous bodily harm. Lewis was jailed for two years and banned from driving for four years. Mr Brushette tried to claim compensation for the horrific injuries he suffered, but has been told that there is a loophole that says he is not entitled to a payout because the incident was not intentional. He first went to government agency the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, which deals with claims by victims of violent crime, but was then directed to the Motor Insurers' Bureau, which is funded by the motor industry. Three years on and he has finally been told he is unlikely to ever receive a payout. Mr Brushette said: 'The guy who did . this to me was sentenced to two years imprisonment but he is out now and . back with his family. 'I feel like the one who's been given the life sentence. How is that justice? 'It's . been three years now and I haven't seen a penny of compensation. I've . got to the point where I don't care if I don't get any money - I just . want people to see what mess the justice system is. 'I pulled over that day to help people out as that was my job but it ruined my life.' Nearly fatal: The crash left Mr Brushette with such serious leg injuries that doctors initially feared they would have to amputate both his legs . The ambulance service has been unable to claim any compensation for Mr Brushette because he was not attending a call out at the time. James Lewis, 28, was jailed for two years and banned from the road for four years after smashing into ambulance worker Victor Brushette in 2010 . He is entitled to carry out a . civil action against Lewis but he is reluctant to take this course because it could . end up costing him more than £25,000 in legal fees and there is no guarantee that he . would be successful. Mr Brushette says the loophole has cost him nearly £15,000 in lost earnings, travel and medical expenses. He . added: 'It's just so frustrating. I had the best job in the world as I . got to help people on a daily basis but now I'm stuck at home unable to . work. 'I'm in constant pain and I can't even do the things I used to enjoy like go fishing because of my injuries. My wife has been amazing throughout but she is working every hour that God sends to keep us afloat. 'We're struggling week to week and now I've been told it's unlikely I'll ever get any compensation - it's heart-breaking. I don't know why I am being punished when I am the victim.' A spokesman for the Criminal Injuries . Compensation Authority defended its decision saying: 'We cannot comment . on individual cases. 'We . compensate blameless victims of violent crime. The Criminal Injuries . Compensation Scheme, which is set by Parliament, makes clear we can only . compensate someone hit by a vehicle if the vehicle was used . deliberately to injure. 'Innocent victims of uninsured or untraced drivers should instead contact the Motor Insurers' Bureau, a company funded by the insurance industry.' Lucky to be alive: Mr Brushette was told he could not claim compensation from the Ministry of Justice because the accident was not caused deliberately . The Motor Insurers' Bureau said: 'The law requires certain vehicles to be insured for use on the road and the Motor Insurers Bureau was established to ensure victims of accidents involving those vehicles have a route to compensation. 'We received a claim from Mr Brushette on 24 May, 2012 following an accident that took place two years earlier involving a quad bike ridden by James Lewis. 'We need to establish if this is a case in which we will be paying compensation by looking carefully at what happened and also finding out if the vehicle involved was one which required insurance. 'Our investigations are on-going at the moment having only just received certain information from the police. 'Regardless of the eventual outcome of the claim, in recognition of the extent of the injuries suffered by Mr Brushette, we are funding some rehabilitation for him via an expert firm we have instructed jointly with his solicitors. 'We will complete enquiries as quickly as possible and keep in contact with Mr Brushette's solicitors.'","Victor Brushette, 59, hit by vehicle on Southend seafront in May 2010 .

Rio Sopp, from Spalding, Lincolnshire, bakes a mouth-watering array of sponge cakes, cookies, muffins and cupcakes specifically designed for man's best friend. While standard human cakes made with sugar and chocolate could be harmful to our dogs and other animals, these cakes look like the real deal but with pet friendly ingredients - and dogs everywhere can't stop drooling over them. Shi the Great Dane tastes every one of Rio's creations before they go on sale. The cakes, which are made from ingredients like carrots and fruits, can also be enjoyed by humans . Rio set up her animal bakery after realising there was a lack of treats available for dogs . Rio bakes sponge cakes, cookies, muffins and cupcakes and has even tried most of them herself . Rio, 22, says she was inspired to set up her business when she struggled to find a birthday cake for her pet horse - and realised thre was nothing that looked like a birthday cake but was safe to eat . And it's not just dogs that have gone barking mad for Rio's creations - the cakes are suitable for most animals including cats, rabbits, horses, and incredibly, humans too. Rio even uses her fussy Great Dane, Shi, as the number one taste tester for all her products. Rio, 22, said: 'I love making cakes for animals. It's really challenging to find all the right ingredients, but as soon as you see a dog wolfing down something you've slaved over, it makes it all worth while. 'I always test out the products on my dog, and I take some down to the local animal rescue centre too - they're very honest critics.' The mother of one set up Old Macdonald's Pet Bakery after struggling to find suitable birthday treats for her pets. 'It was my horse's birthday and I was trying to find a birthday cake for her. 'I was looking around for ages and there just wasn't anything available that would look like a birthday treat, but be safe for him to eat. After its initial success- with both pets and owners, Rio is now planning to continue to expand her business with new and exciting recipes . Since launching her business Rio has been inundated with orders for personalised birthday cakes . Though Rio has tried most of what she makes, she confesses she has not plucked up the courage to try her chicken and cheese cookies . After posting a picture of the cake on Facebook, Rio began to get requests from friends and family to make treats for their pets too . 'In the end I decided to make one myself and after searching online I found a recipe for a yummy equine meadow cake. 'It was basically just the same as a carrot cake but with a few extra types of fruit and other pet-friendly ingredients. 'I remember thinking how easy it was to make and I wished that there were more products out there.' The mother of one set up Old Macdonald's Pet Bakery, whose the cakes are suitable for most animals including cats, rabbits, horses, and incredibly, humans too . Rio takes a fresh batch of he doggy cookies out of the oven, but every new product has to be approved by her Great Dane Shi . After posting a picture of the cake on Facebook, Rio began to get requests from friends and family to make treats for their pets too. 'That's when I realised that there was obviously a demand for these types of treats, so I set up Old Macdonald's Pet Bakery' said Rio. 'When I told my partner, Chris, about it he was really supportive, although he definitely thought I'd gone a bit mad. 'My family are all as animal mad as me though, so they thought it was a great idea.' Soon word got around about Rio's innovative new business, and the order started rolling in for personalised birthday cakes, doggy cookie platters and Easter hampers for pets. The Old MacDonald's bakery will bake nearly anything an owner desires for their much loved furry friend . You can order a platter selection of goodies, should you chose to throw a party for your canine companion and invite his friends . 'It was really exciting when people started ordering things, and now I get lots of commissions every week. 'The most popular thing at the moment is the hampers for the dogs which include cakes and biscuits but I'm always experimenting with new ideas. 'I tend to take the basic cake recipe and then adapt it with different types of fruits. 'So far my dog seems to think the carrot cake is the best, but she turned her nose up at the apple cake - that was a bit of a disaster.' Rio has to be especially careful that none of the ingredients are harmful for the animals, as well as keeping them healthy. Rio says of her venture: 'As soon as you see a dog wolfing down something you've slaved over, it makes it all worth while' Rio says she tends to take the basic cake recipe and then adapt it with different types of fruits to get many different flavours and varieties . Any chocolate that I use to decorate products is 100 per cent dog-friendly and I always have my long list of things that are poisonous to animals close by to ensure every item is safe. 'For example dogs can't eat raisins or grapes so they're never included in the things I bake. 'The treats are really healthy too. I don't put any sugar in them because you can use fruit to make the cakes and cookies sweet, and all the butter is unsalted. 'The icing is all made out of fat-free soft cheese with food colouring. And as any good chef does, Rio tries out all her products to ensure they're just right for her pampered pets. The cookies might be favoured by dogs, but they would also suit a human dieter as they contain no sugar- with all the sweetness coming from the fruit . Judging by the reaction of these two customers, it is easy to see why Rio's bakery has gone from strength to strength . 'I have tried the horse cake, dog cake and dog muffins, which were fine for humans, too - just not as sweet as ours. 'The only thing I haven't tried are the chicken and cheese cookies - although they're my dog's favourite.' Rio now plans to continue to expand her business with new and exciting recipes. 'The next thing I'd like to try is pet friendly pastry. I want to start making cheese straws and sweet pastry too.

Chemists have reported a sharp rise in the demand for off-the-shelf sleeping aids. Figures released by online pharmacy, Chemist Direct, show that sales of products such as Nytol, Bach Rescue Remedy Night Spray, and Kalms herbal tablets, rose by 20 per cent in the six months to March, compared to the same period last year, and by 36 per cent compared to September to March 2010-11. Chemists have reported a 20 per cent rise in the demand for off-the-shelf sleeping aids . London tops the league table of sleepless towns and cities as the insomniac capital of Britain. Manchester and Glasgow were second and third in the list. All of the top ten insomnia hotspots were found to be major cities or towns  and the list included Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield. Experts say that people are increasingly struggling to sleep because of the rise of the 24/7 society. Technology, such as mobile phones and iPads, ‘creeping’ into the bedroom as people continue to work late into the evenings is also thought to contribute to the problem. ‘It’s not surprising that people are increasingly struggling to sleep, with our busy lifestyles, worries with the recession, and long working hours, it can be difficult to switch off,’ said Omar El-Gohary, Superintendent Pharmacist at Chemist Direct. ‘Some of our customers have told us they work from their computers in bed. We’re seeing the rise of the duvet desk.’ Last month a study by the Lighting Research Centre at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, concluded that using an iPad for two hours before bedtime harms your sleep. It said that using an iPad set at maximum brightness for at least two hours suppresses the normal night-time release of melatonin - a crucial hormone in the body's clock. The increase in people working late into the night from their beds may also be down to the pressure of the economic climate. A recent report by Travelodge, based on the sleep patterns of 6,000 adults, said that Britons have lost almost an hour's sleep a night during the recession with money worries and work related stress being cited as the main reasons. This is supported by a survey of 500 customers carried out by Chemist Direct, asking how many hours a sleep they think they get each night of the week. One in five admitted they sleep less than two hours on an average Sunday night. ‘Being overtired from cramming too much into the weekend, recovering from a hangover and worrying about the week ahead, can all contribute,’ said Mr El-Gohary. Experts say people are increasingly struggling to sleep with the rise of technology, such as mobile phones and iPads, 'creeping' into the bedroom . ‘Steps people can take to help encourage sleep include avoiding caffeine and alcohol in the evenings, exercising regularly but not close to bedtime, and creating a calm and relaxing environment by turning off mobile phones, televisions and iPads so they don’t creep into the bedroom.’ Mr El-Gohary and his team analysed the buying habits of Chemist Direct’s one million regular customers, and found that the numbers of new customers buying sleep aids is increasing. ‘This is not a hard-core group of people coming back time and time again, rather we’re seeing increasing numbers of new customers looking for ways to help them sleep, suggesting the pool of people finding it hard to sleep is increasing and the problem is growing.’","Sleep data shows London is the insomnia capital .

Accusations: The Australian foreign minister Bob Carr has accused Baroness Thatcher death of making 'unabashedly racist' comments, warning him that Australia could be 'overtaken' by Asian migrants . 'His . decision to make these claims after her death is a crude attempt to . slur the reputation of one of the 20th century's most outstanding . leaders,' Ms Bishop said in a statement on Wednesday. Mr Carr made the comments yesterday in a television interview from China - although his claims cannot now be verified. 'I recall one conversation I had with her in her retirement where she said something that was unabashedly racist,' he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Uncomfortable: Mr Carr said his wife Helena - who was born in Malaysia - was 'standing not far away' when she made the controversial comments, but was 'fortunately out of earshot' '(She said) that if we allowed too . much of it we'd see the natives of the land, the European settlers, . overtaken by migrants,' he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Carr, a former premier of New South Wales state, said Lady Thatcher used the Pacific island nation of Fiji to as an example. 'She said you'll end up like Fiji. She . said 'I like Sydney but you can't allow the migrants,' and in context . she meant Asian migration, 'to take over otherwise you'll end up like . Fiji where the Indian migrants have taken over'. Criticism: Tasmanian Minister David O'Byrne's wrote on Twitter that Lady Thatcher was a 'war criminal,' stating 'lets never forget the Belgrano...' The Belgrano's last moments in 1982. The cruiser was torpedoed by the British nuclear submarine HMS Conqueror on 2 May 1982. Its sinking remains one of the most controversial actions of the Falklands conflict . Anger: Opposition counterpart Julie Bishop says his comments are graceless and he should immediately apologise . Mr Carr admitted he 'couldn't believe' her comments and he was so speechless that he 'couldn't think of an appropriate reply.' 'It . reminded me that despite yes, her greatness on those big questions - . the role of the state, the evil nature of communist totalitarianism - . there was an old fashioned quality to her that was entirely out of touch . and probably explained why her party removed her in the early 90s.'

"By . Rob Preece . PUBLISHED: . 03:23 EST, 29 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:45 EST, 29 June 2012 . Another scandal rocked the financial sector today as the City watchdog revealed some of Britain's largest banks will have to refund or pay compensation to potentially thousands of small businesses. Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) have all agreed to compensate customers after the Financial Services Authority found 'serious failings' in the sale of complex financial products. They were found to have mis-sold so-called interest rate swap arrangements (IRSAs), which some small businesses bought as protection - or to act as a hedge - against a rise in interest rates without fully grasping the downside risks. Scandal: Royal Bank of Scotland and three other banks have all agreed to compensate customers after the Financial Services Authority found 'serious failings' in the sale of complex financial products . Banks sold about 28,000 interest rate protection products to customers since 2001, the FSA said. Martin Wheatley, managing director of the FSA’s conduct business unit, said: 'For many small businesses this has been a difficult and distressing experience with many people’s livelihoods affected.' The claims echo the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal that emerged last year, costing banks billions of pounds, and come in the week Barclays was fined £290million for manipulating the rates at which banks lend to each other. As well as offering redress directly for those customers that bought the most complex products, the banks have also agreed to stop marketing certain IRSA products to retail customers, the FSA said. The City regulator has spent the last two months reviewing the sale of IRSAs, talking to more than 100 customers who came forward. Mis-selling: Barclays and HSBC are among the banks facing hefty compensation bills . It found poor sales tactics including failing to provide sufficient information on the hefty exit costs involved, failure to gauge the customers’ understanding of risk and found rewards and incentives were a driver of these practices. The FSA added that not all businesses will be owed redress, but for those that are, the exact redress will vary from customer to customer. This exercise will be scrutinised by an independent reviewer at each bank appointed under the FSA’s powers. Mr Wheatley added that he had received personal reassurances from the bosses of the banks involved - including Bob Diamond at Barclays - that they will have responsibility for oversight of this work. Mr Diamond is facing calls to resign over the interest-rate rigging scandal, and Lloyds, RBS and HSBC are all under investigation. The British Bankers’ Association, the leading trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector with more than 200 member banks, said: 'Our members have been working closely with the FSA while it carries out its thematic review into interest rate swaps and will continue to co-operate fully.' In a statement, Lloyds, which set aside £3.6billion to cover the cost of PPI compensation, said it did not expect the costs of redressing customers who were missold IRSA products to be 'material'. It said: 'Interest rate derivative products are not products the group has sold widely. 'Given the limited exposure of the group to these products the financial impact of this remediation and the associated costs are not expected to be material to the group.' Thousands of small businesses who took out loans bought interest rate swap arrangements (IRSAs) in the hope of keeping their borrowing costs low. But many have been left paying the price, claiming they were not told about the potential pitfalls which lay ahead. Banks promoted IRSAs as providing protection to borrowers with variable rate loans. If interest rates went up, customers with an IRSA would pay no more than an agreed capped rate. The deal was attractive when interest rates were as high as 5.5 per cent before the credit crunch of 2008. But rates have since fallen to 0.5 per cent, which means customers' monthly loan repayments under an IRSA are higher than they would have been without one. Bully Banks, a pressure group set up by alleged victims of swap mis-selling, claims on its website: 'In many cases the bank had simply never explained the possibility of this happening, and so customers were denied the opportunity of making an informed choice when entering into an IRSA.' The group claims banks failed to explain the negative aspects of the IRSA because the products were sold by specialist teams who earned high levels of commission. Some customers have paid high costs to extricate themselves from their IRSA deals. A statement for RBS said: 'In the case of a small number of less sophisticated customers who entered into more complex swap products we have agreed to move directly to redress. 'We believe risk management products are an essential part of corporate banking and it is important we restore customer trust in this area. 'We are committed to the fair and timely treatment of our customers and will work closely with the FSA to achieve that end.' A debate in the House of Commons last week saw MPs from across the country offer examples of mis-selling for the interest rate swap products. Promise: Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, who is facing calls to resign over the interest-rate rigging scandal, has assured the FSA he will personally oversee the payment of compensation to customers . Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb claimed thousands of businesses lost large amounts of money after being mis-sold the complex products by their banks, and many were told that without signing up they risked being refused credit. He said many business people did not understand the deals but trusted their bank manager. In other cases, he said, businesses were offered only one product and the bank made no effort to provide a choice. A survey by Bully Banks, which has been set up by alleged victims of swap mis-selling, found nearly three quarters of its members claim to have been forced to buy a swap by their lending bank as a condition of their loan. Michael Brennan, of City law firm Bracewell Law, which has acted for IRSA customers, said the FSA's announcement was 'welcome news to the thousands of small businesses who were wrongly advised, and sometimes obliged, to needlessly take out these complex financial contracts'. He added: 'Over the life of their contract, these financial products turned out to be for the sole benefit of the banks and in the vast majority of cases were highly inappropriate for small and medium-sized enterprises. 'Sold as protection against rising interest rates, they had the effect of keeping struggling businesses on artificially high rates, costing them thousands of pounds per month to service. 'Furthermore, businesses were all too often unable to service these agreements due to the high breakage fees, the risk profile of which the banks never properly explained to them. 'We are aware of many businesess that have been forced into severe financial distress, administration and liquidation, often at a huge emotional cost to the owners and managers, as they were unable to keep up with their payments.'","Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS all agree to compensate customers who bought IRSAs .

A jealous woman, who was part of a kinky sex slave ring, strangled a beautiful Marine's wife who she thought was trying to come between her and her 'master', according to newly unsealed search warrants. Jessica Lopez, 25, is one of three suspects accused of murdering 22-year-old Brittany Killgore, whose body was discovered near a Southern California lake in April. Three days before her disappearance she filed for divorce from Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, who was serving in Afghanistan at the time. Jealousy? A suicide note allegedly written by Jessica Lopez (Left) details how she strangled Marine's wife Brittany Killgore (right) after Killgore became involved with a man she was having a relationship with . The newly unsealed search warrants suggest Lopez was in a relationship with her two co-defendants U.S Marine Staff Sgt. Louis Ray Perez, 45, and Dorothy Maraglino, 36. The three lived togther in a home in Fallbrook, near San Diego. Detectives who searched the property found what they described as a 'sex room/dungeon' with 'several bondage type apparatuses; toys and tools.' Lopez was charged with Mrs Killgore's murder after she was found at a San Diego motel room having stabbed herself multiple times. Although none of her injuries were . life threatening, she had written a seven-page suicide note detailing . what happened to Mrs Killgore and where her body was dumped. Search . warrants, which were unsealed yesterday at the request of news . organisations, reveal the contents of the note in which Lopez uses a . variety of profanities to describe Mrs Killgore. 'Master'? Marine Staff Sgt. Louis Perez is accused of luring Mrs Killgore to her death . She also refers to a 'master' and 'mistress' believed to be Perez and Maraglino. The note reveals how Lopez believed . Mrs Killgore was trying to come between her, Perez and Maraglino and how . she acted after the victim told her that she had a 'whole night . planned' with Perez, a Marine. Lopez said she had been burned before in a relationship and knew what she had to do when Mrs Killgore entered their home. Lopez said she shot the victim with a stun gun, wrapped a rope around a neck, buried her face in a pillow and strangled her. The letter reads: 'She barely moved but she just wouldn't die, the miserable whore.' 'Mistress': Co-accused Dorothy Maraglino, 36, was allegedly part of the sex slave ring . Lopez . said she made 'a few attempts to chop her up' with Perez's power tools . and doused Mrs Killgore's body in bleach to get rid of evidence before . dumping the nude body near Lake Skinner, near Riverside. The handwritten letter, which was discovered below a mirror scrawled with the word 'PIGS READ THIS' - accused police of 'complete incompetence.' 'Master I am so sorry I dragged you into this,' it reads. 'I thought I was defending the family and it would be simple like Dexter (a serial killer in a television show). 'To Mistress I have always lived to be your slave & pet I'm sorry my last act is to leave this world without permission but I cannot bear your grief & my guilt at seeing Master go through this from my choice.' The documents say her body was found with neck injuries consistent with strangulation and marks on her wrist and leg that suggested someone tried to use a saw or other tool to dismember her. The letter details where the body was dumped, telling police they would likely find handcuff marks on the wrists. It says the handcuffs and a knife were disposed at a beach restroom in Oceanside. Three days after Mrs Killgore vanished, detectives searched Perez's mud-caked Ford Explorer and found a plastic bag with a stun gun, latex gloves and Killgore's blood. Perez's DNA was found on the stun gun. The documents describe an elaborate ruse for Perez to conceal his whereabouts on the night Mrs Killgore vanished. Broken relationship: Three days before her disappearance Mrs Killgore filed for divorce from Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, who was serving in Afghanistan at the time . Prosecuters have alleged Mrs Killgore was lured to her death through a conspiracy executed by the trio. They . claim she was convinced to go on a boat cruise with Maraglino, 36, but . on the drive there with  Perez, 45, texted the word 'help' to a friend. On the day she disappeared Mrs Killgore sent a text message to a friend that said, 'Help' Within minutes, according to investigators, Perez had himself texted Maraglino asking her to meet him at the home they shared with Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, and on April 17, Killgore's nude body was found on the side of the road. Perez, a Marine told detectives he picked up Mrs Killgore for the dinner cruise but instead dropped her off at a downtown San Diego nightclub. He said he couldn't find her at the club after parking and returned home. Mrs Killgore's and Perez's cell phones remained in Fallbrook that night, contradicting his statement that he was in San Diego, according to authorities. Mrs Killgore sent a text message to a friend that said, 'Help,' at 7:50 p.m., about 13 minutes after Perez picked her up. The friend asked if she was OK and insisted she call. About two hours later, the friend got a response, 'Yes I love this party,' which fueled suspicions because Mrs Killgore always texted 'yeah' instead of 'yes' and had said nothing about going to a party. A transient found Mrs Killgore's phone at his feet when he woke up in the doorway of a downtown San Diego hotel that night. A San Diego County sheriff's detective said he believed Perez drove downtown to get rid of the phone. The documents give no indication that Mrs Killgore knew about the sex ring and prosecutors call her an innocent victim. Detectives said she accepted Perez's invitation to a San Diego dinner cruise after Perez helped her move that afternoon. The warrants do not say how Killgore met the suspects. All three have pleaded not guilty to murder. Sloan Ostbye, Lopez's attorney, didn't immediately respond to a phone message Wednesday. She joined the San Diego County district attorney's office in an appeal to keep the documents sealed, calling much of her client's letter 'false or at least misleading and possibly delusional.'

The two Leveson lawyers who went on holiday to a Greek island during the media standards inquiry may face an investigation by the barristers’ disciplinary body. A senior MP yesterday wrote to the Bar Standards Board asking it to examine Daily Mail revelations about the affair between celebrities’ barrister David Sherborne and Carine Patry Hoskins, a member of Lord Justice Leveson’s legal team. The couple admit going to Santorini – apparently only to ‘discuss the possibility of a future relationship’ – but claim their affair did not begin until after the Leveson report was published in November. Affair: Mr Sherborne, a barrister who represented Hugh Grant, and  Mrs Patry Hoskins, a member of Lord Justice Leveson’s legal team,  claim their relationship did not start until after the inquiry . But Rob Wilson, a Tory MP and aide to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, wants the board to examine whether there may have been a breach of the Bar’s code of conduct. Mr Wilson, who has already asked Lord Justice Leveson to investigate the barristers’ affair, said: ‘It is only right that an inquiry into breaches of ethical standards be seen to be completely above board itself. ‘If there have been breaches of the legal profession’s ethical code of conduct by members of the Leveson Inquiry team, these must be accounted for to the public. ‘If this affair isn’t investigated promptly and properly, it risks becoming a stain on the reputation of the Leveson Inquiry.’ Twice-married Mr Sherborne, 44, and 40-year-old Mrs Patry Hoskins did not tell Lord Justice Leveson about their affair and he only learnt of their trip to Santorini in recent days. Not informed: Lord Justice Leveson was not told about the affair and only learned about the couple's holidaying together in the past week . A spokesman for the judge said yesterday: ‘Lord Justice Leveson understands that the Bar Standards Board is aware of the recent Press reports. It is a matter for the board to decide what, if any, action to take.’ MP letter: Rob Wilson wants Bar Standards Board to examine whether there may have been a breach of the code of conduct . Bar Council guidelines warn barristers it is very unwise to have relationships with counsel involved in the same case because clients might perceive ‘a danger of breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. That would be likely to breach the lawyers’ code of conduct. It prohibits barristers from acting ‘where by reason of any connection with the client, the court, or otherwise’, a barrister’s professional independence ‘might be compromised or there might be prejudice or the appearance of prejudice to the administration of justice’. In his letter, Mr Wilson asks the board to investigate whether there have been several breaches of the code. These include engaging in conduct likely to diminish public confidence in the legal profession or otherwise bring the legal profession into disrepute, a requirement to act with independence and not to do anything that may lead to any inference that a barrister’s independence may be compromised. The Bar Standards Board will normally carry out an initial assessment before deciding whether to undertake a formal investigation which could lead to a disciplinary tribunal. The board can impose punishments ranging from words of advice, fines or suspension to ultimately having a barrister struck off. Calls for an investigation came after it emerged that Mr Sherborne and mother-of-two Mrs Patry Hoskins went to Santorini last August, days after the public hearings concluded and months before the inquiry ended. Father-of-three Mr Sherborne represented Hugh Grant and other phone-hacking victims at the Leveson Inquiry. Glamorous brunette Mrs Patry Hoskins, nicknamed the ‘thinking man’s Pippa Middleton’, was required to be totally independent when testing evidence given to the £6million inquiry on behalf of the public.","Hugh Grant's barrister and a member of the Leveson team having an affair .

Defence: Google boss Eric Schmidt has today defended the internet giant's tax affairs, saying the firm was playing a key role in the UK's high-tech growth . Google's chairman last night provoked outrage when he defended the company’s low tax bill by saying it has plenty of British staff who pay their taxes. Last year the internet giant paid just £7.3million in corporation tax on more than £3billion UK sales. But in an extraordinary interview, chairman Eric Schmidt said the American company helped the economy in other ways, selling online ads and hiring staff who pay income tax. ‘We empower literally billions of pounds of start-ups through our advertising network and so forth,’  he said. ‘We also hire more than  2,000 employees.’ He added: ‘The people we employ in Britain are certainly paying  British taxes.’ Google was branded ‘a parasite’ for leaving small businesses to pick up the tab for its tax avoidance. Entrepreneur Luke Johnson, former chairman of the Pizza Express restaurant chain, said: ‘My companies employ perhaps five times as many staff in Britain as Google and pay far higher rates of corporation tax.’ Mr Johnson, who runs investment group Risk Capital Partners, added: ‘They do not make an appropriate contribution and are a parasite.’ Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘I just think it is completely, utterly and totally wrong a global company can be so relaxed about engaging in  economic activity in a country and making a profit and feeling no responsibility to pay its fair share of tax.’ Anger: Web giant Google avoided paying $2billion in tax last year by moving around 80 per cent of its overseas profits to a company in the tax haven of Bermuda . Last year Google was slammed by MPs as ‘immoral’ for its tax-dodging, alongside Amazon and Starbucks. A customer boycott of Starbucks shamed the coffee chain into paying £20million to HMRC. Google has not offered any additional payments. Asked if he was worried about a boycott, Mr Schmidt said: ‘We worry about everything at Google.’ At the weekend George Osborne said he wants to focus on tax reform in Britain’s G8 presidency this year. Google paid just £7.3million in corporation tax last year on UK sales of £3.1billion. It did so by reporting small profits in the UK, funnelling the rest of the money to Ireland and then into the tax haven of Bermuda. Under fire: Other companies like Amazon and Starbucks have also been criticised over their tax affairs in the UK . Starbucks has more than 700 outlets in the UK generating revenues of more than £3billion but it paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in its 14 years of trading in the UK and nothing in the last three . In January the Daily Mail revealed . Google pushed more than £6billion into Bermuda, costing global . governments at least £1billion in lost tax. Experts say this shaves more than £200million from its UK tax bill. But Mr Schmidt yesterday shrugged off the claims in a BBC interview. ‘These are the way taxes are done globally,’ he said, speaking on The World at One. ‘We fully comply with the law and obviously, should the law change, we’ll comply with that as well.’ But he admitted that Britain was a ‘very, very good business environment for us’. The company employs around 2,000 employees in the UK.","Eric Schmidt says company's tax affairs 'fully comply with the law' in Britain .

An illegal immigrant became a drug dealer to fund her children's private education and send £23,000 back to her home country Jamaica, a court heard. Sophia Bailey, 40, of Gloucester, should not even have been in the UK when she began dealing in crack cocaine and heroin. When police raided her home they discovered 75 grams of crack cocaine, some of it hidden in a Cadbury's hot chocolate tin in the kitchen, along with 38.6 grams of heroin. At Gloucester Crown Court the mother of two pleaded guilty to possessing heroin with intent to supply in January. She also admitted possessing crack cocaine on the same date. She further pleaded guilty to removing the proceeds of crime, £7,920, from the UK by transferring it to Jamaica between 1 January 2011 and January 10, 2013. And she admitted possession of £1,500 which she knew represented the proceeds of crime. On Friday Judge William Hart jailed her for 40 months and he said he 'fondly hoped' she would be deported on release. 'You are a Jamaican national and of previous good character,' said the judge, 'Quite why you chose at the age of 38 and with no previous convictions to get involved in this only you can know. 'I am quite satisfied you approached someone of similar national origin to yourself and you asked to go into business as a 'sub dealer' for him. 'You had in your possession a significant amount of drugs of high purity together with cutting agents.' Prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said police raided Bailey's home on January 10 and found the drugs, which had a purity rate of more than 70 per cent and were worth between £6,000 and £8,000. Electronic scales, clingfilm and latex gloves were among the drug dealer's equipment also found. Gloucester Crown Court heard that the had absconded from UKBA control in 2008 . Ms Hennessy said: 'They also found a . Jamaican national certificate of deposit and shares in the name of . Sophia Bailey, her Jamaican passport and an envelope with ""Sophia . £1,650"" written on it. 'Over £1,500 in cash was in her handbag. 'She told the police she had been dealing drugs for the previous two years, having lost her cash in hand job. She said she approached a Jamaican friend asking to deal drugs for him. 'She said she'd sold the drugs to numerous people. It was clear she had managed to transfer £23,000 in cash to people in Jamaica during the previous 5-6 years. 'She said she would get up to 3.5 ounces of crack and heroin delivered at a time and the more she sold the more she got paid. 'It emerged she was an illegal immigrant who had absconded from UK Border Agency control in 2008.' Judge Hart formally certified that Bailey had benefited by £14,310 from crime and had £1,650 available for confiscation. Lloyd Jenkins, defending, said her life had 'fallen into the doldrums' when she lost her job in December 2010. She had been in the UK since 2006 and was the carer for her elderly uncle, now 86, he said. She had turned to drug dealing because she wanted to continue to support her uncle and also her parents, who are in poor health, said Mr Jenkins. He added: 'She also two children, now aged 18 and 20, who had very expensive school fees.' Jailing her, Judge Hart said many people questioned why illegal immigrant offenders were not just immediately deported rather than put the UK to the cost of jailing them. But he said there had to be prison terms or foreigners would come to the country just to commit crime in the knowledge that the worst that could happen to them would be to be sent home.","Sophia Bailey had turned to dealing to support her family in Jamaica .

Sierra was last heard from on Jan. 21, the day she was to start her journey back home to Staten Island as well as the day she planned to meet up with 'Taylan,' according to their online communications. A police official refused to identify him or provide further details on the arrest. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government rules that bar civil servants from speaking to reporters without authorization. Police also now say her cell phone has been . activated twice since reported missing leading them to believe there's a . good chance she is still alive. Sierra is said to have made a call on her phone using Skype on January 30, and have activated it once more again on Thursday. Police say four more Turkish citizens are sought . for questioning by police after also communicating with her through . various social media sites. Turkish news reports said Sierra had arranged to meet her contact, 'Taylan,' on Galata Bridge she wanted to photograph the day she went missing. Previous reports claimed the planned to meet on the 20th. No trace: Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old mother of two young sons, set off for Istanbul January 7 and has since vanished. Her family last heard from her January 21 and she failed to catch her flight home . It was about a mile from Sierra's hostel, Dogan news agency reported but it's not known if the meeting had actually taken place. January 7: . Sarai Sierra left the U.S. for IstanbulJanuary 15: .

Authorities are now scouring security . camera images near to the bridge to see if the meeting did in fact take . place, the news agency said. Sierra left for Istanbul on Jan. 7 to explore her photography hobby and made a side trip to Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Munich, Germany. Sierra had planned to go on the trip with a friend, but went alone when the friend couldn't make it. Her family last heard from her on Jan. 21, when she was supposed to start her journey home, but she never checked into her flight. Sierra's husband, Steven, and brother, David Jimenez, traveled to Istanbul to help in the search. Sierra's children are 9 and 11. Staten Island Rep. Michael Grimm confirmed to Staten Island Live that police in Turkey were searching for her online contact but he did not know their relationship or if they had met. 'There's nothing remarkable about their conversation, but the fact that . he's the last person she had any contact with makes him a person of . interest,' Grimm said. 'That's a solid lead that needs to be followed up . on.' He added that he . spoke with Sierra's husband Steven on Tuesday, and that the man was . meeting with local authorities and had provided them with passwords to . her social media sites. Her husband said . Sierra was in constant contact with him throughout the trip and knew she . had travelled outside Turkey. Investigation: A Turkish security official leaves the hostel with Sierra's belongings on Tuesday . Search: Members of the Istanbul-based Association For Families With Lost Relatives hand out flyers with photos of Sierra, and other missing family members, in Istanbul on Thursday . 'These are things she made me well aware . of,' he told Staten Island Live before leaving for Istanbul. 'She kept me 100 percent updated.' Turkey's Dogan news agency said police had learned that Sierra had travelled . to Amsterdam on January 15 and then on to Munich on January 16, before returning to . Istanbul on January 19. Her husband continued: 'Every day while she was there she pretty much kept in . contact with us, letting us know what she was up to, where she was . going, whether it be through texting or whether it be through video . chat, she was touching base with us.' On . Tuesday, Turkish police released security camera footage showing the . missing mother at a mall near her hostel hours before she disappeared. Apart: Sarai's husband Steven, pictured, said she had told him about her trips to other countries . Sierra can be seen eating lunch and walking through the mall on January 20 - a day before she was supposed to catch a flight back home - according to local reports. Sarai was supposed to land in the . U.S. on January 22, but she never arrived. Airline staff at Newark . Airport told her husband she had never . boarded her flight. Her two sons have not been told their mother is missing. A . police official said authorities have been reviewing footage from . around Istanbul's Taksim neighborhood - the city's main hub where she . was staying at a hostel. Several police teams have also been . dispatched to surrounding neighborhoods to find possible clues and . witnesses, the official said.

Spotted: The footage from inside a mall close to her hostel shows her eating lunch in the cafeteria . He spoke on condition of anonymity, . in line with government rules that bar civil servants from speaking to . reporters without prior authorization. Before she went missing, the . mother-of-two told family members that she planned to take some . photographs at Galata Bridge, a well-known tourist destination about a . mile away from Taksim that spans the Golden Horn waterway. Her husband, Steven Sierra, waited for . hours at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on the 22nd . to pick her up. Airline attendants in Turkey said that his wife did not . show up for the flight. Her belongings, including her . passport, phone, phone chargers, and medical cards, were found in her room at a hostel in Beyoglu, Turkey. An official said authorities were therefore not able to track her by her cell phone. Mother: Sarai is pictured with her two sons, who are now 9 and 11. They do not know their mother is missing . The hostel’s . owner told Turkish authorities that he had last seen her last on Sunday . night. Mr Sierra told ABC News that . her behavior is highly unusual, that she seemed perfectly content with her life, and that going off the radar is . extremely out-of-character for her. The heartbroken . husband said that he's been married to her for more than 14 years after meeting her at a church youth group, . adding that his love for her is ‘deeper than it is for any individual'. He told WABC: ‘You . have so many thoughts going through your mind, you don’t know what to . think, you don’t know what to believe, you don’t know what to expect, . you don’t know what will come out of this.' Mystery: A view of the street with the hostel, in yellow, where Sarai Sierra, a New York City woman, left all her possessions before she disappeared .

Phillips' grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, as well as her mother, Princess Anne, were in the VIP seats at Greenwich Park as Phillips competed in the eventing dressage competition. She scored a solid 48.10 penalty points, despite a mistake toward the beginning of her canter in the first 'flying change.'

'It was incredible to be selected, . and to be at here at home for the Olympics is an amazing feeling. You . try to do your best for the team.'

Despite a small hiccup, Phillips said she was pleased with the performance. 'It was disappointing about his first . change, but his other ones were really good,' she said afterward. 'But . he coped with all the crowd and is only getting better.' Phillips, a former world and European . eventing champion, said the mistake had nothing to do with the . enthusiasm from the stands - a rousing welcome that prompted the . announcer to remind the audience to keep applause to a minimum until the . test was finished. The 13th in line to the throne has . never competed in an Olympics because of injuries to her former horse . Toytown in 2004 and 2008. Take a bow: Zara Phillips, of Great Britain, competes with her horse High Kingdom, in the equestrian eventing dressage phase of the 2012 Olympics . But she is now one of the favourites for a medal as she tries to emulate her father Captain Mark Phillips, who won Olympic gold in 1972 and silver in 1988. Phillips, who was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year after being crowned eventing world champion in 2006, will compete in the individual and team three-day eventing competitions. The word 'dressage' is a French term meaning training. Horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of choreographed movements. It takes years of dedication and training to reach the Grand Prix level which is seen at the Olympics. The close relationship between horse and rider takes months, if not years, to form. Horse and rider are given a mark out of ten for each movement they perform plus additional marks for the horse's pace, impulsion, submission and the rider's position. There were a number of empty seats in the arena today as Zara competed, but speaking yesterday, equestrian sport manager Tim Hadaway said crowds at the event move throughout the venue during the day, meaning some seats may be left empty at times. He said: 'A lot of people are out and around the arena, sitting on the grass looking at the big screens. There is an opportunity for spectators to walk around the cross country course. 'That perhaps explains why seats are unfilled. It's a long day of dressage, people watch five or six tests and then they go and look around.' The equestrian event is being held at Greenwich Park, which dates from 1433 and is the oldest royal park in London. The main equestrian arena sits right in front of Queen's House, a 17th-century building designed as a summer palace for Queen Anne of Denmark, the wife of James I. Horses are a big part of the royal family: the queen is an accomplished and enthusiastic equestrian and still rides often. Princess Anne is not only president of the British Olympic committee but a member of the International Olympic Committee and a former equestrian eventing Olympian herself. She competed in the 1976 Montreal Olympics but her horse fell going over a jump during the cross country event. In the first day of the dressage competition Saturday, Australia took the early lead with Germany and the United States close behind.

Internet service appear to have been restored in the Syrian capital following nearly three days of a nationwide communications blackout. The Syrian government apparently sought to flex . its muscles on Thursday by shutting down internet and phone services across the . country. But journalists in the capital, Damascus, have reported that internet connections are now up and running with dispatches coming in from the central cities of Homs and Hama, the northern city of Aleppo and areas along the coast.

While the . government attributed the loss of the internet and cellphone service to . 'terrorists', experts said the progressive shutdown of connectivity . could only have been orchestrated by a central authority. Meanwhile, Syrian troops continued to clash with rebels today as government forces pushed a major offensive on villages and towns near the capital's international airport, activists said. The fighting over the past few weeks in Damascus is the worst to hit the capital since July, when rebels captured several neighborhoods before a quick government counteroffensive swept out the opposition fighters. It comes after the U.N reported syrian refugees are being shot at as . they flee to neighbouring Jordan. U.N spokeswoman Melissa Fleming told a news briefing in Geneva: 'We have received very disturbing reports from Syrian refugees in Jordan who say they were targeted as they were fleeing. 'UNHCR calls on all sides to ensure that at least civilians have access to safe passage outside the country.' It was not clear who was taking aim at civilians as they ran for their lives under cover of darkness. 'These reports are generally kept highly confidential, people are terrified. They don't like having their stories told,' Fleming said.

The UN refugee agency also said 250,000 . people were living in temporary shelters in the flashpoint city of Homs, . without adequate food, clothing or medicine as winter added to the . misery of civil war. A UNHCR team managed to reach Homs this week, where they found 250,000 displaced people living in 'squalid' conditions. Fleming added: 'They saw thousands of displaced people living in unheated communal shelters. 'They also observed that half of the city's hospitals are not functional and there were severe shortages of basic supplies ranging from medicine to blankets, winter clothes and even children's shoes.' One communal building sheltered 70 families, or 400 people, while at another '2,300 people are crammed into an abandoned public building, the largest such shelter in Homs'.

Some . city hospitals have been converted into communal shelters and 60 . percent of Homs doctors have left, along with other medical personnel, . according to the agency. A UNHCR convoy of nine trucks delivered winter assistance to Homs during the two-day visit ending on Thursday night, including quilts, sleeping mats, winter blankets, mattresses and sanitary napkins. 'We are scheduled to deliver more aid in coming days.

Brutal: Unarmed men appear to plead for their lives in footage allegedly filmed in Ras al-Ain, Syria, by a rebel fighter . Execution: The armed gunman filming the footage appears to shoot the prisoners in the head . The report came just hours after footage was posted on the Internet on Thursday night that appeared to show a Syrian rebel shooting 10 unarmed prisoners. The video shows 10 men wearing t-shirts and camouflage trousers lying face down next to a building and a lookout tower. Even before the shooting, two of the men are not moving and one has blood coming from his torso. 'I swear to God that we are peaceful,' begs one of the men to the camera, which is being held by the gunman. Cowering, the man gets up to plead with rebels. As he approaches a rebel off-screen, a shot is heard and he returns holding his bloodied arm. The cameraman then points the camera along the barrel of his Kalashnikov assault rifle as he shoots the men. 'God is great. Jabhat al-Nusra,' he says, referring to the secretive al-Nusra Front, an Islamist rebel unit linked to al Qaeda that has claimed responsibility for several suicide bomb attacks around the country. The gunman gets on the back of a pickup truck and the camera pans to show the man who had been shot in the arm still moving. More shots are fired and his body spasms.

A private funeral was held earlier this month in New Hampshire for his mother, Nancy Lanza, who was divorced from Peter Lanza. Peter Lanza lives in Stamford, Conn., and is a tax director at General Electric. Connecticut's chief medical examiner Wayne H.

A couple have been arrested and charged with child abuse and animal cruelty after 300 different pets were found in their Florida home. Police were called to the home of Jeffrey O'Neil and Jennifer Kovacs yesterday when the pair reported that their 16-month-old daughter was missing. The girl was found safe - but her parents were arrested over the menagerie of snakes, lizards, rats and other animals which made the house almost uninhabitable. Arrested: Jeffrey O'Neil, left, and Jennifer Kovacs, right, have been charged with child abuse and animal cruelty . O'Neil, 28, and 26-year-old Kovacs called police at six o'clock on Sunday morning when they woke up after a party and realised their daughter was not in the house. When police arrived at their home in Oldsmar, the pair were apparently drunk, while the house had an overwhelming stench due to the animals - both dead and alive - which were being kept there. Officers discovered a note from a relative who had taken the girl when she found O'Neil passed out from drinking, and the child was determined to be safe and well. The 298 animals in the house were removed by Tampa Bay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Filth: The house was full of dirty cages and had an overwhelming smell thanks to the 300 animals there . Dangerous: Authorities said the presence of animals such as pythons made the house unsafe for a child . According to the Pinella County sheriff's office, O'Neil and Kovacs were keeping seven Burmese pythons, 20 other snakes, more than 100 lizards, 100 rats and mice to feed to the reptiles, other assorted rodents and two dead scorpion spiders. 'Looking at the animals, this is definitely a case of animal hoarding,' an SPCA spokesman told Fox Tampa Bay. The unemployed couple are being held without bail at the county jail. O'Neil's Facebook profile says he is the owner of 'J&J's Reptile/Rodent Shack & Rescue', which aims at 'respecting and protecting many reptile/exotic species by promoting conservation education'. He does not have a licence to breed or sell animals. Menace: Neighbours claim they have to be careful about going outside due the the number of reptiles . Police described the condition of the house as 'deplorable' and said it was unfit for a child to live in - but Kovacs' mother Joyce, who also lives there, says that apart from the strong smell it is a decent place to live. The 63-year-old said O'Neil brought the animals when he moved in with her and her daughter three years ago. 'You just can't imagine having that many critters,' she said. Mrs Kovacs, a retired teacher's assistant, told Fox she had put up with the couple for the sake of her granddaughter, and added that she would now seek custody of the girl. Neighbour Scott Giles told the Tampa Bay Times that O'Neil's animals caused a major nuisance in the area. He said he spent much of his time chasing snakes away from his yard, and had had to forbid his children from playing outside.","Jeffrey O'Neil and Kennifer Kovacs reported their 16-month-old daughter missing when they passed out drunk after a party .

Aelita's cheapest works are selling for more than £3,000 each and it is . estimated she has already made more than £100,000 from her art - more . money than most professional artists earn in a lifetime. The money she earned so far has been . put into a trust fund by her parents, Russian-born mother Nikka . Kalashnikova and Australian father Michael Andre. Nikka said she quickly realised her daughter's approach and technique was different to other children play painting. She told Sky News: 'Her composition, her use of colour, her concentration span. 'Sometimes . even as a little kid she was painting for about one hour, . one-and-a-half hours, she would walk off, then come back again, it is . just her concentration. 'Usually kids paint for two or three minutes and they have had enough, they run off, but not Aelita.'

Some cynics have suggested the little girl's work is influenced by her parents. However, to counter those claims, Aelita's father Michael filmed his daughter painting a canvas from beginning to end and posted it on Youtube. The Melbourne prodigy's paintings have already been compared to modern art greats like Jackson Pollock and Pablo Picasso. The five-year-old's proud dad said last year: 'She chooses the colours herself. She's so determined, and forceful, and decisive, and she'll actually get angry if you attempt to suggest a colour.' Aelita began painting before she could walk at 11-months old and now has her own space to create her artworks, mainly using acrylics on canvas. Once her parents saw that she had a talent, they submitted her work to a local gallery, prompting the owner to arrange a special exhibition for her, unaware of her tender age - then only two years old. While most of her paintings now retail for between around $5,000 and $10,000 it was a picture of the Russian Mir space station that set her record price of $24,000 in Hong Kong. Her parents have insisted they do not force her to paint and that her work should be judged on its artistic merits and not her age. They also hope her success paves the way for other talented children. Michael added: 'Aelita had a very, very difficult run. When her work was initially judged, it was purely on the painting itself. Nikka deliberately withheld her age just to see what the reaction was.' NOW WATCH THE VIDEO .","Aelita Andre has been painting since the age of two and her cheapest works sell for  £3,000 .

Ryan Black was rushed to a specialist hospital when he developed severe breathing difficulties after his birth last August. Doctors discovered that he had hypoplastic left heart syndrome - a condition affecting one in 5,000 children - meaning the left side of his heart had not developed in the womb. Ryan Black, now nine-months-old, was born with just half a heart because the left side did not develop in the womb . Despite having just a 25 per cent chance of survival, he had open heart surgery when he was eight-days-old and had a second operation just two days later. Ryan also had another open heart operation in February this year. He is now a healthy nine-month-old baby and is expected to make a full recovery. His mother, SallyAnn Charlton, 34, from Rainworth, near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘Naively, you never think your child will be ill, let alone seriously ill, so you are just helpless because there is nothing you can do. ‘It was a huge shock. It’s been a roller-coaster journey and my head was everywhere for the first few weeks. ‘I didn’t know what to think or what to do. Ryan (pictured with his mother, SallyAnn Charlton) was rushed to a specialist hospital 50 miles away because he developed severe breathing difficulties after birth . The baby (pictured with his mother and sister, Eva) underwent two open heart operations in the first few days of his life . ‘I’m a very positive person anyway, but you have to be, you have to fight as much as you can. ‘Ryan is a fighter, the doctors have all said that, and hopefully he will continue to fight.’ The baby was born at Kingsmill Hospital in Mansfield on August 15, 2012, but was rushed 50 miles to to the specialist heart unit at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester when he became unwell. Medics scanned his heart and confirmed he had hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Ryan had to have a shunt inserted to allow oxygenated blood to travel from his lungs to the rest of his body . Doctors said that he only had a 25 per cent chance of survival . He was put on a ventilator and underwent open-heart surgery when he was just eight-days-old. During a six-hour operation, surgeons inserted a shunt into his heart to pump oxygen rich blood from his lungs around his body. Due to complications, he had to undergo a second open heart operation when he was ten-days-old and was kept on a ventilator while his mother held a bedside vigil. He had to have another operation in February this year because he started to suffer from breathing difficulties again . He now has to sleep on a special mat which sounds an alarm if he stops breathing . In February this year he was rushed back to hospital after outgrowing the shunt and struggling to breathe. Doctors performed a third open heart operation to remove the shunt and he now uses a vein in his neck to help supply his organs with life-giving oxygen. He is now recovering but has to sleep on a special ‘sensor mat’, which will sound an alarm should he stop breathing. He is now thriving and doctors think that he will make a full recovery . His mother, SallyAnn Charlton, is now raising money for his medical equipment . Ms Charlton, who also has a five-year-old daughter called Eva, said: ‘Not only has she had a little brother but she’s had a little brother who is seriously ill. ‘It’s had a big impact on her too, but she’s been brilliant.’ Ms Charlton is now raising money for Ryan’s medical equipment and is fundraising for heart charity Keep The Beat, which works with Glenfield Hospital.","Ryan Black, now nine-months-old, has hypoplastic left heart syndrome .

"By . Louise Eccles . PUBLISHED: . 06:05 EST, 23 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:59 EST, 23 April 2013 . Sir Denis Thatcher may have ‘contemplated divorce’ after he suffered a nervous breakdown due to work pressures, it has been claimed. His marriage to Margaret Thatcher – seen as one of the strongest in politics – hit the rocks when he had a form of ‘mid-life crisis’ as he approached his 50th birthday. Their daughter Carol told Lady Thatcher’s biographer, Charles Moore, that as well as being ‘genuinely knackered’, Sir Denis ‘didn’t like every aspect of being married to a politician’. Margaret Thatcher came to rely on having her husband Denis by her side during her 11 years in power, but a new biography reveals the couple almost split in the 1960s . The couple married in 1951, six years before she was elected MP for Finchley . Sir Denis, pictured playing golf in 1985, suffered a nervous breakdown in the 1960s . George Osborne said today that he had found the funeral of Baroness Thatcher an 'overwhelming' occasion as he faced questions over his tears during the ceremony. The Chancellor, who was caught on camera during the service last week at St Paul's Cathedral, said it had been 'a very, very powerful and emotional' event. 'I welled up a bit because I thought it was a very emotional and moving occasion and at times overwhelming,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'I think it was a fitting tribute to someone's life and in a sense a great State occasion as well. The combination of the sermon and the music and so on made for a very, very powerful and emotional moment.' Mr Osborne brushed aside questions from Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys about how often he weeps. 'Well, I was caught on camera so I can't deny that it' Mr Osborne said. 'Occasionally I get a tear in my eye, sometimes just when I listen to the Today programme headlines, but on this occasion it was a much more moving moment.' In 1964, Sir Denis sought refuge in . South Africa for more than two months, leaving behind his wife and young . twins. According to Mr Moore, who interviewed Sir Denis, Lady Thatcher . ‘had no certainty that he would ever return to her’. ‘It was not just that he was exhausted . and confused, it was also possible that their marriage would end,’ he . wrote. ‘It was the worst personal crisis of her married life. ‘He may even have contemplated divorce.’ Prior to his breakdown, Sir Denis was . running the family paint business, Atlas, and often travelled abroad, . while Lady Thatcher was junior pensions minister. They were both . ‘working too hard to enjoy themselves’,  said Mr Moore in Margaret . Thatcher: The Authorised Biography, published yesterday. Miss Thatcher admitted her father had . come to a crossroads in life, telling Mr Moore: ‘I think he had to make . up his mind. That was it.’ He refused to blame his wife’s career . for his breakdown, but according to Mr Moore: ‘Carol Thatcher records . that friends believed that Margaret’s absorption in her own career at . this time left him feeling isolated.’ Miss Thatcher said her father only . ‘came into his own’ after he retired and became full-time consort to his . wife when she was Prime Minister. He fully recovered from his breakdown . and remained married to Lady Thatcher for 52 years until his death aged . 88 in 2003. Sir Denis told Mr Moore his wife was ‘very worried’ during . his breakdown, but largely kept it to herself, telling just ‘one or two . of her closer friends’. The couple had met in 1949, soon after she was selected as a parliamentary candidate for the safe Labour seat of Dartford. Their first impressions of one another were lukewarm. Sir Denis thought she was ‘a nice-looking young woman, a bit overweight’. The 23-year-old politician sent a . postcard to her sister Muriel, saying she had met ‘a Major Thatcher, who . has a flat in London (age about 36, plenty of money) ... not a very . attractive creature – very reserved but quite nice’. When he proposed to . her in 1951, he recounted how ‘she didn’t leap at it’. In her autobiography, she wrote: ‘When . Denis asked me to be his wife, I thought long and hard about it. I had . so much set my heart on politics that I hadn’t figured marriage in my . plans. ‘But the more I considered, the surer I . was. More than 40 years later I know that my decision to say “yes” was . one of the best I have ever made.’","Work pressure mounted on Sir Denis in the 1960s when his wife was an MP .

A mother has spoken of her fury after doctors sent her son home 11 . times in five months before discovering a football-sized tumour in his stomach. Sharon Woolley was told her five-year-old son Charlie was . suffering from constipation - when all along he . had neuroblastoma, a rare and aggressive cancer with one of the lowest . survival rates. Miss Woolley believes the time delay in . diagnosis may now affect whether he survives the disease or not. He has . been given a survival rate of less than 40 per cent. Delay: Sharon Woolley claims she was sent home by doctors ELEVEN times in five months before her son Charlie was finally diagnosed with an aggressive form of childhood cancer . Happier times: Charlie, before he fell ill. The delay in diagnosing his cancer means his chance of survival is now less than 40 per cent . Charlie had been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome - a form of autism - which doctors said could cause consitpation . Miss Woolley, who lives in Lytham St . Annes, said: ‘If we hadn’t been fobbed off so much for so long, and . Charlie had been diagnosed earlier, maybe he would have much better odds . today. 'I’m just . hoping that he can been strong enough to fight this terrible disease. I . am so angry that he was sent home by doctors eleven times before it was . diagnosed. ‘It was only because I was so convinced that something was terribly wrong that I kept going back to the doctors repeatedly. ‘When he was finally diagnosed with cancer I was so angry that it hadn’t been spotted before.’ Charlie . first started complaining of stomach ache in January last year. He was . also refusing to eat and appeared pale. Miss Woolley, who is separated . from Charlie’s father, took him to the GP. The doctor told Miss Woolley that it . was probably just constipation, but the problems worsened over the next . few weeks and his stomach started to swell. She . took him back to the doctors twice more. Both times she was referred to . Blackpool Victoria Hospital,here doctors gave him laxatives and sent . him home. Miss Woolley said: ‘I was so worried about Charlie. He had severe stomach ache constantly and his stomach was swelling. ‘He . was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome - a form of autism - at the age . of three, and they said that constipation can be a problem for autistic . children. ‘I told . the doctors I wasn’t happy with the diagnosis of constipation and I . begged them to scan him, but they wouldn’t, as they told me that stomach . ache was very common.’ In March, she took him back to the GP for his sixth visit, who gave him a different type of laxative to try. Then in April, she was forced to take . him to both the GP and then the out-of-hours surgery at the hospital as . it was during a weekend and she was so worried. She . said: ‘By now I was almost demented with worry. He was losing weight, . his spine was protruding, and his stomach was even more swollen. ‘By . May, when I took him for his ninth appointment, he looked nine months . pregnant. He had stopped going to school as he was in so much pain. He . couldn’t walk properly as he couldn’t stand straight, instead he wanted . to crawl everywhere. Battling: Charlie was only diagnosed with neuroblastoma after he was seen by doctors for the 11th time - and his mother insisted on a scan . ‘I didn’t know what to do - I was at . the end of my tether. I had gone to the GP’s, the out of hours surgery . and the hospital nearly a dozen times, but no-one would listen to me. I . felt like I’d been failed on every account. ‘In desperation I even rang his paediatrician whom he is under for Asperger’s Syndrome, but even she couldn’t help.' On her 11th visit to the GP, she was once again referred to the Blackpool Victoria Hospital. This time, as she sat in A&E, she told the nurse that she wasn’t leaving the hospital until Charlie had been given a scan. She . said: ‘I sat in the hospital with Charlie in my arms and I was so angry . I shouted at the nurses that I wasn’t going anywhere. ‘I . didn’t care who was watching me, I had to get someone to listen to me. I . could see my boy was dying and no-one was doing anything about it.’ The hospital agreed to do a CT scan and when they saw the results the doctors immediately carried out more scans and biopsies. ‘The . sonographer asked the nurse if Charlie was an in-patient, and told her . that if he wasn’t, he needed to be admitted fast. He had seen something . on the scan but I didn’t know what it was.’ Fight: Charlie's mother said that even before he was diagnosed, he was unable to stand because of the pain . Charlie . was then referred to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital where . Miss Woolley was told that he had neuroblastoma, an aggressive childhood . cancer. ‘I was devastated, but I’d known that . something was badly wrong with my boy. The doctors told me the tumour . in his stomach was the size of a basketball and it was so big that they . couldn’t even see his lungs or liver on the scan.’ A . stage two or three tumour has a survival rate of 80-95 percent, but . Charlie had a stage four tumour, where the survival rate drops to less . than 40 per cent. Miss . Woolley said: ‘I was so angry I couldn’t even think straight. All this . time when I’d been fighting for someone to take me seriously, cancer was . ravaging my son.’ Charlie . is currently undergoing chemotherapy and he also needs an operation to . remove the tumour. Miss Woolley is also raising funds to take him to . America for treatment, at a cost of £250,000. Treatment: Charlie is currently undergoing chemotherapy and needs surgery to remove the tumour . Miss Woolley added: ‘The doctors and nurses at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital have been fantastic, and I’m hoping that Charlie will pull through. ‘But I’m so angry with the previous doctors, that I was sent home 11 times. I can only hope that my son survives after all this.’ Alison Moy, Chief Executive for the Neuroblastoma Alliance, said: ‘It can be a difficult cancer to diagnose, but it is a nasty and phenomenally aggressive cancer, so a few months delay in diagnosis can make such a difference as a neuroblastoma tumour can grow from two to 12 centimetres in a fortnight.’ Dr Mark O’Donnell, Medical Director at Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘The Trust is deeply sorry to hear about this family’s distress, it’s always very upsetting when a family member is seriously ill, particularly so when it’s a child. ‘We are unable to discuss details of individual cases due to patient confidentiality. Whilst I’m not aware of the family raising any complaint with the Trust, I will be writing to them to arrange a meeting in person so that they can discuss their concerns in detail with us.’ To help with Charlie’s fundraising for treatment, visit www.travelswithcharlie.org .","Doctors told Sharon Woolley her son Charlie, 5, was constipated .

Stuart Richmond, 30, hit Lucas Hibbert when his van was speeding in a 30mph zone, sending the boy flying through the air and causing serious head and body injuries . A judge has condemned a decision to prosecute a police patrolman for dangerous driving after he accidentally knocked down a schoolboy whilst answering a 999 call. PC Stuart Richmond, 30, approached a red light at up to 40mph and hit 13-year old Lucas Hibbert on a pedestrian crossing whilst responding to an emergency request for help from a colleague. The youngster, from Salford, Greater Manchester, suffered serious injuries to his head and body was left in a coma. He later regained consciousness and was back in school several weeks later but is still said to be recovering from 'life changing injuries.' Richmond had his blue lights flashing on his patrol van at the time of the accident and hit Lucas at 38mph in a 30mph zone. But he was accused of dangerous driving and faced a possible two years in jail after prosecutors said he 'made little or no effort to slow down' at the crossing. At Bolton Crown Court the case against him collapsed after a senior officer who investigated the crash said the officer responded 'appropriately' to the 999 call. Instead, Richmond pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of careless driving and was fined £350. His licence will be endorsed with five penalty points. It emerged he had been on restricted driving duties for 18 months since the accident. He now faces misconduct allegations. Passing sentence Judge Peter Davies said the trial had been 'unnecessary' and it was 'regrettable' that it had gone ahead. The judge added: 'It's a great shame that so much time and so much public money has been spent and a young man working hard on his profession should have to endure so much for 18 months. 'There should be some more objectivity at the CPS. There really should be some objectivity. In these days when public money is at a premium, it was not appropriate to put Mr Richmond in this ordeal.' The accident happened in Swinton, Salford, on October 1, 2011, whilst Richmond was responding to a call from another police officer after trouble flared in a pub. Lucas - who was with two friends - crossed the main road while riding his scooter and when the traffic signals turned red he began to cross. Class mates at Swinton High School welcome back Lucas Hibbert (centre left) in December 2011 . PC Richmond overtook a line of traffic which had stopped at the traffic signal and struck Lucas. Prosecutors said expert analysis showed that by the time he reached the pedestrian crossing Richmond was travelling at 42mph - and skidded and hit Lucas at 38mph. Tests showed he had been travelling at up to 51mph in the run up to the crash. CCTV footage confirmed the traffic signal had been red for around five seconds before the impact. Prosecutors say he failed to follow police driving guidelines stating that red lights should be treated like a 'stop' or a 'give way' sign. His Honour Judge Peter Davies condemned a decision to prosecute PC Richmond for dangerous driving . But Inspector David Peach, a senior traffic officer at West Yorkshire Police, who investigated the crash said he believed PC Richmond had 'a momentary lapse of concentration' as he arrived at the crossing and didn't anticipate Lucas crossing the road. During pre-trial proceedings the Crown Prosecution Service had been asked to review their evidence, but officials continued with the case. Richmond's lawyer Robin Sellars said there had been a 'very prolonged failure' by the CPS to 'address the situation rightly'. Today, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said Greater Manchester Police were considering misconduct matters against the officer. IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: 'The public expects police officers to respond quickly to emergencies and as a result officers are given certain powers and rights. 'However those rights cannot and should not give permission to drive in a way that puts the public at risk. 'PC Richmond drove through a red traffic light without any caution and seemingly without any perception of the risk. As a result a young boy sustained life changing injuries. 'I wish Lucas well in his continued recovery. Today's outcome should serve as a reminder to police officers that their powers and rights must be used with caution and great care.' A CPS spokeswoman said: 'We note the outcome of the case and we will carefully consider the remarks made by Judge Davies.'","Lucas Hibbert suffered 'life-changing injuries' and was left in a coma .

Psychiatrists have warned medical 'withdrawal' symptoms will be felt by fans across the country on Sunday night - leaving thousands in an off-season funk due to a chemical imbalance in the brain left by the love of the game. Feeling blue: A psychiatry expert from Chicago has warned some football fans will need to be eased out of the season following Sunday's Super Bowl . So for health reasons alone, Dr. Angelos Halaris, medical director of Adult Psychiatry at the Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, says some fans will need to watch re-runs to ease themselves down. The scientist claims football fans' brains create dopamine on watching the crowning glory of their favorite sport. But when the Super Bowl is over, no matter who wins or loses, they often suddenly feel bereft by the   absence of this happiness neurotransmitter. And the come down can be hard - similar to giving up cigarettes according to Dr Halaris, leaving sufferers depressed and lonely. He advises easing football fans back to normal life slowly so they can adjust to the off-season period. 'When the football season is over and there's no other game on the schedule for months, you're stuck, so you go through withdrawal,' Dr Halaris says. Shrinking happiness: Dr Halaris warns fans may feel the off-season blues and will need to watch re-runs until they are able to live without football . He advises fans to watch recordings of the sport slowly weaning themselves off, as well as talking to others about how they feel. 'Don't go cold turkey. Watch football on YouTube, or on recordings, in gradually diminishing amounts,' he says. 'Share your feelings of withdrawal and letdown with a friend or spouse.' Though hours of re-runs or lengthy conversations about the intricacies of the 49ers defense may not go down well with those long-suffering family members less taken with the sport, there is also some more straightforward advice. 'While it can be unpleasant, football withdrawal is not serious enough to require antidepressants or other medications. And do not self medicate with drugs or alcohol', Dr Halaris continues. And for those completely unsympathetic to the pains of Super Bowl withdrawal there is one final word of advice that may strike a cord. 'You're just going to have to basically tough it out until football starts up again,' Halaris adds.","Chicago psychiatrist advises football fans to watch re-runs and season footage until they can cope without football altogether following Sunday's Super Bowl .

This is the dramatic moment police arrested a drugs courier after a police chase - an operation that led to a big time  cocaine dealer being put behind bars. Mark Dainty, 46, who lived the high life from the profits of his evil trade has been jailed for nine and a half years. He drove a high-powered BMW and bought top of the range motorbikes and a speedboat. He also took his glamorous girlfriend on numerous sunshine holidays to exotic locations. Scroll down for video . Investigation: The courier Erik Thomas, 32, of Yate, Bristol, in a white Ford Transit van (ringed) captured on police CCTV . Police give chase: As officers in a squad car surround Dainty's van it swerves into the fast lane . But now the gang leader who believed he was too clever for the police is behind bars after a long term under cover operation ended with a dramatic car chase as a helicopter hovered overhead. At Gloucester Crown Court, Dainty was jailed for nine and a half years and three of his henchmen received sentences of between four and five and a half years at the same hearing. The court was told that police kept observations on Dainty's gang transporting cocaine regularly between Leicester and Gloucester over a two year period. When police finally pounced on his courier van they seized around half a kilo of cocaine with a potential street value in excess of £100,000. Officers allege that as a whole the conspiracy involved drugs with a potential street value of £250,000. Officers also seized Dainty's Bayliner speedboat worth more than £25,000. It had a newly-fitted sound system costing £2,500. They also seized a high-spec motorbike. Thomas tried to escape the blockade and drove dangerously onto the other carriageway in the face of oncoming traffic . Thomas (ringed) then emerged from the van, walked out onto the road and lay face down on the road to be handcuffed . Thomas emerged and so did Donna Gittings, 27, of Worcester, who was travelling in the van with him. Both were arrested on suspicion of possession of a class A drug . Dainty, of Gloucester, had been running a motorcycle shop, Dockside Superbikes, as a cover for his illicit trade. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine and money laundering. The police operation began in early 2011. On Thursday, April 21, 2011, Gloucestershire Police traced one of the group's couriers, Erik Thomas, 32, of Yate, Bristol, as he travelled in a Ford Transit van between Worcester, Leicester and Gloucester.

Right: Sperm donors have been handed the right to play a part in the lives of their biological children following a landmark High Court decision . Sperm donors were handed the right to see and play a part in the lives of their biological children in a landmark High Court case yesterday. They may now also win the right to regular contact with the children, even though they are not bringing them up. The ruling by the Family Division decreed that a sperm donor need never have had a sexual relationship with a mother in order to have a say in the child’s upbringing. The judgement came in a complex dispute over parental rights between three gay and lesbian civil partner couples. This case involved a donor who had previously known the mother of the children. However, the ruling leaves open the prospect that unprecedented rights for involvement in the lives of children may be granted to sperm donors who have little or no connection to the mothers. The case threw fresh light on the agonising dilemmas that can be faced by the growing numbers of gay families. Until now the law – set down five years ago in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act – has refused contact for sperm donors who have no other legal or domestic relationship with their biological children. The case was brought by a gay sperm donor whose child is being brought up by a lesbian couple. The Family Division ruling applies because the 2008 Act extended the law governing the rights of sperm donors to cover same sex couples. The biological father and his civil partner were friends with two lesbian couples, both also in civil partnerships. He is the father of two children of one of the lesbian couples. His civil partner is the biological father of a child being brought up by the other lesbian couple. Landmark: The ruling, stating that courts should respect a sperm donor's relationship with his biological child, was made in the High Court's Family Division . However, the agreement on paternity was struck informally between the friends and nothing about each couples’ duties and rights as parents was ever written down. The arrangement between the couples broke down after the male couple applied to the Family Court for contact with their children. The sperm donor in whose name the case was brought also asked for the children to live with him and his civil partner, but the court refused to consider this. The female couples objected on the grounds saying that contact would infringe their family life. The Family Division judgement said that the family rights of the couples bringing up the children should be respected. But it said that courts must consider a sperm donor’s connection to his biological child. Kevin Skinner, solicitor for the lesbian couple who must now offer contact to the biological father, said: ‘Although the judge’s decision makes clear that the family unit should be protected, the possibility of donors being able to apply for court orders will be a scary prospect for many parents, both gay and straight. ‘What is crucial is that anyone planning on having a child through the use of fertility treatment should make sure that proper plans are in place before the process begins.’ Respect: The judgement said that the rights of couples bringing up children should be respected, but that courts must consider a sperm donor's connection to his biological child (stock image) Under current law, generally sperm donors can have rights and duties over a biological child – including a duty of financial support – if the family in which the child is being brought up has no father or mother to assume responsibility. The legal problems thrown up by children of gay couples and civil partners have led to a series of court cases which have tried to untangle complex family relationships of a kind that rarely came before the courts in the past. Complex: The ruling was made in a a complex dispute over parental rights between three gay and lesbian civil partner couples (stock image) In a similar case last year three Appeal judges allowed a gay biological father whose relationship with a lesbian couple bringing up a child had broken down the right to see the child. The biological father was the husband of one of the lesbian couple, and the two had married because the woman wanted to demonstrate to her disapproving parents that she had formed a traditional family. In the case with married parents, Lord Justice Thorpe said the married couple had been naïve not to foresee difficulties. The sperm donor in the case may have been ‘seeking to offer a relationship of considerable value’, the judge said. Lord Justice Thorpe added: ‘It is generally accepted that a child gains by having two parents. 'It does not follow that the addition of a third is necessarily disadvantageous. ‘Human emotions are powerful and inconstant.’ He said the couples involved ‘may have had the desire to create a two-parent lesbian nuclear family completely intact and free from fracture. 'But such desires may be essentially selfish and may later insufficiently weigh the welfare and developing rights of the child.’","High Court's Family Division handed donors right to play part in child's life .

For over a century scientists have been baffled by what caused the terrible disfigurement of the Elephant Man Joseph Merrick. But now they will attempt to unlock the secret of his suffering by analysing DNA from his bones - and hope to finally diagnose his condition. Researchers intend to carry out tests next month to discover, if possible, Merrick's genome sequence which will highlight any gene alteration. Disfigured: Joseph Merrick the Elephant Man and his skeleton which could hold the key to his condition . His skeleton has been preserved at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel since his death at the age of 27 in 1890 after a life of being regarded as a freak in Victorian society. Screen star: A scene from the 1980 film 'The Elephant Man starring John Hurt as Joseph Merrick . Constant bleaching to keep it clean has degraded the bones, so scientists are facing a difficult task to get enough DNA from the abnormal area of his skull. Professor Richard Trembath, vice . principal and executive dean at Queen Mary, University of London is responsible for Merrick's remains and is in charge of  the research. He told the Sunday Independent: 'This is going to be extremely demanding. We need to know whether we can get sufficient [genetic material] from what we believe to be abnormal bone as well as sufficient from normal bone. 'In doing it, we have an absolute regard to make sure we preserve the skeleton. We can't just mash a whole amount of it up. We have to preserve it for future generations because it's an important historical record.' Merrick's earned his nickname because he was believed to be suffering from Elephantiasis, a condition caused by a parasitic infection leading to thickening and enlargement of the skin and tissue. But in 2001,there was speculation that Merrick suffered from a rare disease called Proteus syndrome which causes skin overgrowth and abnormal bone development. Merrick was born apparently health in Leicester 1862, but as he grew up his lips thickened and a bony lump grew on his forehead. He had to sleep . sitting up because of the weight of his head. There was a significant difference between the size of his left and right hand and both his feet became enlarged. His speech became difficult to understand. Finally, his parents and stepmother rejected him and forced him out onto the streets when he was 17. Because of his deformities, he wore a hat and hood to hide his scary looks. To earn money he . agreed to appear in a sideshow exhibited as a 'human curiosity'. Broadway show: Actor Brad Cooper plays the Elephant Man without the aid of  prosthetics . By chance surgeon Frederick Treves who worked at London Hospital opposite the show, saw Merrick and invited him to be examined and photographed. Merrick later lived his final years at the hospital where he became a celebrity and no longer shunned by society. He was even visited by Alexandra, Princess of Wales. The official cause of his death was asphyxia, although Treves, who dissected the body, said he had died of a dislocated neck. He believed that Merrick had been attempting to sleep lying down, to 'be like other people'. In death, the Elephant Man's story has fascinated the world. He was played by John Hurt in the 1980 film Elephant man and Hollywood heart-throb Brad Cooper is currently starring on Broadway in an adaptation of the screenplay.","They will extract DNA from his bones which could reveal his condition .

Alexia Douglas, 16, died on impact after Christina Shiver, who had only just passed her driving test, lost control of her SUV in St. Petersburg, Florida at 7pm on Friday and smacked into a barrier. The car jumped the curb onto the sidewalk. Authorities say metal . guardrails pierced through the passenger's side windshield, killing Alexia immediately. Christina, also 16, was treated in hospital but only suffered minor injuries. A witness said that she believed her best friend was still alive and wanted to ride with her in the ambulance to hospital. Tragic: Alexia Douglas (left) died after her friend Christina Shiver (right) lost control of their car . 'I just looked away for a second,' she said, according to Doug Ruppel, who spoke to the Tampa Bay Times after witnessing the deadly crash. Alexia's mother remembered how the girls were inseparable. 'They were always, always together,' Barbara Nicholl said. 'They got along with everybody, but they always said . they were each others' only friend. Every weekend it was Alexia and . Christina.' The girls, who met at middle school, would spend every Friday and Saturday night together and watch music channels, play computer games and chat about the next concert they would attend. Best friends: Relatives described the girls - who were hanging out as they did every weekend - as inseparable . Accident: Christina, right, told police she became distracted while driving and her car veered off the road . Loss: After Alexia died, Christina reportedly believed she was still alive and wanted to ride to hospital with her . On the night of the tragedy, the girls did not have any set plans, but discussed going to the mall or watching films together. The girls attended Northeast High School, where counselors are on hand to speak with students. Alexia ranked in the top one per cent of her sophomore class, the Times reported. 'Everybody is just distraught about it,' principal Kevin Hendrick said.

'I'm afraid I'll ask too many questions, and I'm . not ready to hear the answers. Not yet.'

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, pictured arriving at Number 10 yesterday, said coalition reforms mean future generations would only need the state pension . The next generation of pensioners should not need to receive extra benefits like free TV licences and help with heating bills, Iain Duncan Smith suggested today. The Work and Pensions Secretary left the door open to removing universal benefits in return for a single-tier pension and encouraging extra saving. He repeatedly insisted David Cameron’s pledge to protect state help for all pensioners was only until 2015, and vowed to ‘detach’ older people from means-tested help. Mr Cameron told pensioners before the last election that the Winter Fuel Allowance, bus pass, Pension Credit and free TV licence were all ‘safe’. ‘You can read my lips, that is a promise from my heart,’ he added. Mr Duncan Smith insisted the commitment was ‘fair and reasonable’ because pensioners are less able to increase their income than someone in work and could then ‘plan for those five years'. ‘The problem with pensioners is they have less flexibility, they find it much less easy to make  provision to change if things are changed for them,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘So you need to take more time and take longer over changes to pensioners.’ But he suggested that beyond 2015 new pensioners might not enjoy the same perks. ‘There’s a cohesive message which says for the most vulnerable people as possible we will try to protect them and for the next generation coming through to ensure that they make the kind of savings and provision that allow themselves to be taken above any extra dependence on the state whilst they receive a decent basic state pension.’ Nick Clegg and David Cameron launched the coalition's Mid-Term Review with a pledge to link rises in the state pension age with life expectancy . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has demanded the universal benefits for pensioners be reconsidered before 2015. But . Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘If there are going to be any changes made as a . proposal those are the sort of changes that have to go into a manifesto. But you would have to be talking about those in advance. We don’t make . plans for the next government at this stage.’ Aides said he was not speculating about the next manifesto. 'What . we are trying to do is detach pensioners from the position of being . dependent on a means test which actually damages savings so we are . restoring the savings culture. 'But these things take time because there is basically a lifetime in work to provide for the time you are on pensions. 'I . think its fairness to pensioners to give them time to make sure you . support their income but at the same time reform the way they save. The . last government damaged the savings culture so we had the worst savings . culture on record.' A spokesman for Mr Duncan Smith said . later: 'Iain made it very clear this morning that we have protected all . the pensioner benefits for the whole of this parliament and there are . absolutely no plans to change that.' Ministers are expected to set out details of an improved state pension 'that . rewards saving', with a new flat rate expected to be up to £155-a-week. The coalition's Mid-Term Review, published yesterday, also committed to linking the state pension age with average life expectancy. Campaigners warn it will mean making people work into their 70s. 'We will put in place a new mechanism to . ensure that the state pension age reflects future changes in life . expectancy so that the state pension system continues to be sustainable . and affordable,' the review said. The . Public and Commercial Services Union said people in the UK could have . to work until they are 70 and beyond before receiving a state pension. And Dot . Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said: . 'Despite the warm words in the mid-term review, the coalition's plans to . reform the state pension system will end up making people work longer . but contains no pledge to give a higher state pension to existing and . future pensioners.'","Work and Pensions Secretary insists handouts like winter fuel allowance and TV licence are safe for current pensioners .

A university team has uncovered a massive Roman mosaic in southern Turkey - a meticulously crafted, 1,600-square-foot work of decorative handiwork on the fringes of the Roman Empire. While Turkey was under the Roman Empire for a time, it was pushed back by the Carthaginians - making this find a demonstration of the surprising reach . and cultural influence of the Roman Empire in the area during the third . and fourth centuries AD. Since 2005, Michael Hoff, professor of art history at University of Nebraska–Lincoln, and a 60-strong team have been . excavating the remains of the ancient city of Antiochia ad Cragum on the . southern Turkish coast. Scroll down for video . New foundations: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln archeological team uncovered the massive Roman mosaic in southern Turkey . Hoff, director of the excavation, said: 'Its size signals, in no small part, that the outward signs of the empire were very strong in this far-flung area. 'We were surprised to have found a mosaic of such size and of such caliber in this region – it's an area that had usually been off the radar screens of most ancient historians and archaeologists, and suddenly this mosaic comes into view and causes us to change our focus about what we think (the region) was like in antiquity.' Antiochus of Commagene, a patron king of Rome, founded the city in the middle of the first century. Hoff said: 'This region is not well understood in terms of history and archeology. 'It's not a place in which archaeologists have spent a lot of time, so everything we find adds more evidence to our understanding of this area of the Roman Empire. 'We're beginning to understand now that it was more Romanised, more in line than the rest of the Roman world than was suspected before. '[The nature of the mosaic] hammers home how Roman this city truly is.' Ancient remains: The mosaics and ancient structures imply the area was once a bustling city . How Europe was won: The Roman Empire - at the height of its reign - covered most of what we now know as Europe, as well as the north of Africa . Antiochia ad Cragum had many of the trappings expected of a Roman provincial city – temples, baths, markets and colonnaded streets, said Hoff. The city thrived during the empire from an economy focused on agricultural products, especially wine and lumber. Excavation has focused on a third-century imperial temple, and also a colonnaded street lined with shops. In July, the team began to explore the mosaic, which was part of a Roman bath. The decoration consists of large squares, each filled with different colored geometric designs and ornamentation. Roman (Red) | Celtic (Green) | Carthaginian (Blue) | Persia (Cyan) | Egypt (Yellow) | Barbarians (Black) 20BC: The Roman Empire begins, spreading out as just a tiny dot from Rome to encompass Italy. At this time, Turkey (outlined) was in the hands of the barbarians and the Carthaginians . 100-200 AD: At the height of the Empire, the Romans encompassed 2.2million square miles . 300-400AD: But as Rome expanded beyond a manageable size, the barbarians pushed back . 'This would have been a very formal associated pavement attached to the bath,' Hoff said. 'This is a gorgeous mosaic, and its size is unprecedented' – so large, in fact, that work crews have uncovered only an estimated 40 percent of its total area. Hoff said it appears the mosaic served as a forecourt for the adjacent large bath, and that at least on one side, evidence shows there was a roof covering the geometric squares that would have been supported by piers. Those piers' remains are preserved, he said. Meanwhile, the middle of the mosaic was outfitted with a marble-lined, 25-foot-long pool, which would have been uncovered and open to the sun. A corner of a Roman bath discovered during the summer . Still intact: The mosaic was buried for centuries, before excavations began in 2005 . The other half of the mosaic, adjacent to the bath, has yet to be revealed but is expected to contain the same type of decoration, Hoff said. Crews expect to unearth the entire work next summer. Team members first noticed the mosaic in 2001 when a large archaeological survey project that included Hoff noticed plowing by a local farmer had brought up pieces of a mosaic in a field next to a still-standing bath structure. The find was brought to the attention of the archeological museum in Alanya, who two years later made a minor investigation that revealed a small portion of the mosaic. Last year, the museum invited Hoff to clear the mosaic and to preserve it for tourists and scholars. Hoff's 60-person team also included Birol Can, assistant professor of archaeology at Atatürk University in Ezrurum, Turkey, a sister university to the University of Nebraska as well as more than 30 students. Hoff said the significance of this summer's discovery has him eager to return to the site and see what the rest of the excavation uncovers. 'As an archaeologist, I am always excited to make new discoveries. The fact that this discovery is so large and also not completely uncovered makes it doubly exciting,' he said. 'I am already looking forward to next year, though I just returned from Turkey.'","Mosaic measures 1,600sq ft and was once part of lavish Roman bath in southern Turkey .

Midsomer, that has a body count of an average 2.6 murders per episode, is based on the books by Caroline Graham and first aired in the UK in 1997. It is set among fictional villages including Great Pelfe, Midsomer Vertue and Luxton Deeping with the county town of Causton, where Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby lives with his wife and where the Criminal Investigation Department is located. Many of the villages and small towns of the county have the word Midsomer in their name, which is inspired in part by the real county of Somerset, and specifically the town of Midsomer Norton. In 2009 John Nettles announced he would retire after the 13th . series of ten episodes, at the end of 2010. Neil Dudgeon replaced him in . the 14th series, playing Tom Barnaby's cousin DCI John Barnaby. The Killing, which was screened in the UK on BBC4, tells the story of dogged . detective Sarah Lund (Sarah Linden in the remake), investigating a . murder. Each hour-long episode represents a day of the inquiry. Audiences were gripped from episode one to 20, and the series went on to win numerous awards including a Bafta. Even David Cameron gave it the Prime Ministerial seal of approval, . revealing that he and wife Samantha often watched the series in bed.","Danes can't get enough of ITV's quaint 'feelgood' crime drama .

Accused: Leeds United youth player Simon Lenighan is standing trial over the alleged rape of a woman in a city centre hotel . A Leeds United youth team footballer raped a drunk woman in a hotel after a night out and filmed the attack on a mobile phone, a court heard. Simon Lenighan, 18, is alleged to have carried out the sex attack on the woman with another man, Nathan Campbell, 23, in the Etap Hotel in Leeds. Leeds Crown Court heard the woman, aged in her 20s, was woken by a chambermaid the next morning and had no idea where she was how she got there. The court heard yesterday that Lenighan and Campbell had left and her mobile phone and money were missing. Police were contacted and video footage was found on Campbell's mobile phone, the court was told. Robin Mairs, prosecuting, said: 'What we say is both Campbell and Lenighan used their video phones to film (the woman) while she lay naked in bed.' Mr Mairs said the men were laughing on the video but did not want to be seen on camera. He added: 'This video, the Crown says, is more than simply a sordid souvenir of what happened in that hotel room. It is more than a lack of decency.' Lenighan, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice. Campbell, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape, one of sexual assault and perverting the course of justice. Mr Mairs said Lenighan and Campbell met each other for the first time on the night of the alleged incident, August 29 last year, when they were drinking in the Tiger Tiger bar in Leeds. The woman, who knew Lenighan, had also been drinking in the bar and agreed to go back to the hotel with the two men. Mr Mairs said the girl had been drinking vodka and friends had been concerned for her safety because she had so much to drink. Attack: The rape is alleged to have happened at the Etap Hotel in Leeds city centre . The jury heard staff at the Etap, which is now the Ibis hotel, noticed that the woman was 'particularly drunk' and the two men appeared 'more sober' when they checked in at 4.15am. One worker was so concerned that he followed them to the room and listened at the door but couldn't hear anything and left. After they were arrested both men claimed the woman was a willing partner in the sexual intercourse that took place between them. Mr Mairs said: 'If someone becomes so intoxicated, so drunk, that they no longer have the capacity to choose, then there cannot be any meaningful consent.' The case continues.

Complaint: Aides of Prince Harry (pictured here serving in Afghanistan) have said pursuing the complaint would be a 'distraction' from his work as an Apache helicopter co-pilot . Prince Harry has decided not to make a formal complaint to the press watchdog over the Sun’s decision to publish nude photographs of him. The tabloid was the only newspaper to defy advice from the Press Complaints Commission not to print the pictures of Harry taken during a game of strip billiards in Las Vegas. The PCC received 3,600 complaints from the public about the photos which showed Harry – along with two naked girls – in his £5,100-a-night suite at the Encore Wynn Hotel last month. Harry, an Apache helicopter co-pilot gunner, has now deployed to Afghanistan. A St James’s Palace spokesman said: ‘Prince Harry is currently focused entirely on his deployment in Afghanistan, so to pursue a complaint relating to his private life would not be appropriate at this time and would prove to be a distraction. 'We have concluded that it would not be prudent to pursue the matter further.’ The PCC, which had warned that publication could breach the editors’ code of practice on  privacy grounds, has already said it would be ‘inappropriate’ to open its own investigation into the Sun’s printing of the photos. The Sun defended its decision to publish, claiming ‘Harry has compromised his own privacy’ and pointing out that the photos were on the internet. He had been photographed while on a short break in Las Vegas just a few weeks before he was sent back to Afghanistan. The Sun’s front-page image showed Harry holding his genitals and another inside showed him with his bottom exposed while apparently playing strip billiards with an unknown blonde. Party time: Prince Harry was enjoying a holiday with friends in Las Vegas (pictured above left and right) when the nude pictures were taken of him .

"By . James Slack and Jack Doyle . UPDATED: . 05:52 EST, 19 July 2012 . Abu Hamza and five other dangerous terror suspects could follow Abu Qatada in being freed to walk Britain’s streets. Unelected Euro judges are preparing to rule if the six – who are accused of running terror camps and extremist websites or plotting atrocities – can be extradited to the U.S. And, in the wake of Europe’s ruling that fanatic Qatada cannot be kicked out of Britain, Whitehall officials are braced for defeat. Following his lead: Hate preacher Abu Hamza, left, could be set free to walk Britain's streets if European judges rule he cannot be extradited to the U.S., repeating the precedent set by Abu Qatada, left . Hate preacher Hamza is claiming that his potential jail term in America could constitute a breach of his human rights because it is potentially ‘inhuman’ or ‘degrading’. Once there is a Euro court ruling that any of the six cannot be extradited, British judges are expected to follow the precedent set by the Qatada case and free them on bail. In a worst-case scenario, it could mean Hamza and his fellow fanatics being released in the run-up to the London Olympics – the biggest security challenge this country has faced in peacetime. Experts have already warned there are up to 200 would-be suicide bombers in the UK, including ‘lone wolves’ seeking religious justification from the likes of Hamza or Qatada to carry out atrocities. The Strasbourg judges are considering whether jail terms of up to 50 years in the U.S. without parole – the sentences faced by Hamza and the others – would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which bans ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’. For all the defendants, except Hamza, they also agreed to examine whether their potential detention in ‘supermax’ high security prisons was a breach of human rights. Considering their verdict: Judges at the European Court in Strasbourg are deciding whether sentences the extremists would face in the U.S. breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights . The court said Hamza had no case against the conditions at a supermax prison because his disabilities – he lost his hands in an explosion in Afghanistan and is blind in one eye – mean he would spend only a short time there before being transferred to a prison with a less severe regime. The latest revelations came after another day dominated by the disclosure that Qatada, one of the world’s most dangerous fanatics, will be released on bail within days. Immigration judges ruled he could be released in the wake of the European Court of Human Rights ruling that he cannot be deported to Jordan in case some of the evidence used against him in a planned terror trial has been obtained by torture. Unacceptable: Home Secretary Theresa May said that she 'vehemently disagreed' with the decision to bail Abu Qatada . Home Secretary Theresa May was called to the Commons to explain how she intends to protect the public from Qatada, a man rated so dangerous that he will be placed on a 22-hour curfew. She told the Commons she ‘vehemently’ disagreed with the bail decision, saying: ‘It simply isn’t acceptable that, after guarantees from the Jordanians about his treatment, after British courts have found he is dangerous, after his removal has been approved by the highest courts in the land, we still cannot deport dangerous foreign criminals.’ She added: ‘The right place for a terrorist is a prison cell and the right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell, far away from Britain. ‘That’s why we will do everything we can within the existing legal regime to deport Qatada, and we’re doing everything we can to reform that regime to avoid these cases in future.’ But backbench Tories queued up to demand Britain’s immediate withdrawal from the European Court of Human Rights and moves to neuter the power of the Strasbourg judges. Shipley MP Philip Davies told Mrs May: ‘It is no good you huffing and puffing about the decision – what the British public want to know is if we cannot secure the reforms we need from the European Court of Human Rights, are we going to withdraw from the European Convention?’ Mark Pritchard, secretary of the Tories’ powerful 1922 committee, said the ECHR was ‘undermining British justice and British national security’. It emerged yesterday that Qadata could be free from all controls within just two years if he stays in Britain. By the end of 2014 both bail and control order powers will have expired – leaving him entirely at liberty. David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Qatada could be subject to a new type of control order known as a TPIM only for a maximum of two years before it expires. Previous control orders could be repeatedly renewed. TPIMs can be renewed in exceptional circumstances, but this is expected to be extremely difficult. A ruling by the Euro judges is expected as early as this month on whether it would be a breach of human rights to extradite Hamza and the five others who the Americans are desperate to put on trial. They include Hamza’s trusted lieutenant Haroon Aswat, who is wanted by the U.S. authorities for plotting to set up a jihadi training camp in Oregon. Trusted lieutenant: Haroon Aswat is wanted by the U.S. authorities for plotting to set up a jihadi training camp in Oregon . Hamza was jailed for seven years in February 2006 for preaching hate and inciting murder at Finsbury Park Mosque in North London. His sentence has now been served and, if extradition proceedings are abandoned, he would be eligible for release. Baba Ahmad and Seyla Ahsan, accused of conspiracy to commit terrorist atrocities overseas and supporting terrorist groups, have been held in high-security British jails for between five and seven years while they fight extradition on human rights grounds. Another man, Khaled Al Fawwaz, has been in jail here since 1999. Allegedly a close associate of Osama Bin Laden, he was arrested in connection with bomb attacks on two U.S. embassies in east Africa which killed more than 200 in 1998. The sixth man, Adel Abdul Bary, is also wanted in connection with the embassy bombings and has been held in prison for 13 years. The British court’s ruling on Monday that Qatada should be freed on bail is based on the fact that, if the prospect of extradition or deportation becomes unlikely, it is unfair to continue to hold a suspect indefinitely. Officials fear this principle would also be applied in the case of the six wanted by the U.S., in the event of an adverse verdict from Europe. Releasing the men would give security officials a massive headache in the run-up to the Olympics. Monitoring fanatics round-the-clock is hugely expensive and time consuming. Bugged: Usman Khan was heard by MI5 discussing plans to recruit radicals to a terrorist training camp in Kashmir . An extremist inspired by Al Qaeda called on British Muslims to claim benefits to fund a terrorist training camp, a court heard yesterday. Usman Khan, 20, was bugged at his home by MI5 discussing plans to recruit 100 radicals to attend the camp in Kashmir to learn to use guns. Discussing fund-raising during a late-night meeting, he declared radicals could receive in benefits in a day what people earn in a month in the disputed region split between India and Pakistan. ‘On Jobseeker’s Allowance we can earn that, never mind working for that,’ he said. Khan added that there were only three possible outcomes for him and fellow jihadists: victory, martyrdom or prison. Members of the group also discussed launching a ‘Mumbai-style’ atrocity in London while others talked about setting off pipe bombs in the toilets of two pubs in Stoke, the court heard. The group’s other targets included the London Stock Exchange and the capital’s Mayor Boris Johnson, Woolwich Crown Court heard. Andrew Edis, QC, prosecuting, said members of the group were recorded in December 2010 calling the late Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden ‘beautiful’. Khan, of Stoke-on-Trent, is one of nine men being sentenced for terror offences. He has admitted engaging in the preparation of terrorism. The hearing continues.","Judges to rule on whether Hamza and five others can be extradited to U.S.

A mother who abandoned her three young children to go clubbing has been spared jail despite it being the second time she had left them home alone. The 40-year-old, of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, spent a day shopping with her boyfriend before heading to a night club in London. She had taken an overnight bag with her and was planning on staying in a hotel. Her reckless actions were exposed when police were called to a heated dispute between her and her partner at the Coronet nightclub in New Kent Road in south-east London. 'Put pleasure before children': A mother left her three youngsters home alone to go clubbing at the Coronet nightclub (above) in London has been spared jail . The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted to officers she had left her three children at home, but claimed they were with a babysitter. Metropolitan Police contacted their counterparts in Essex and officers were sent to her home where they found lights on inside but nobody would answer the door. It was only when police warned they would force their way in to the home, that the mother finally admitted her three daughters - aged 12, six and four, were home alone without a minder. Basildon Crown Court was told the mother had left a mobile phone with the girls but did not have one with her so there was no way that she could be contacted. At her sentencing hearing yesterday, it emerged she had received a police caution for a similar offence in 2009 when she left her girls home alone. The mother, who appeared in the dock in a white blouse, wept as Judge Owen Davies QC told her she would not be jailed. Irresponsible: Basildon Crown Court (pictured) was told the mother had left a mobile phone with the girls but did not have one with her so there was no way that she could be contacted . She was instead sentenced to a 12-month supervision order having pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to neglecting and abandoning her children. During the hearing, Judge Davies said: 'Here we have for the second time, little girls left alone to fend for themselves whilst their mother thinks only of herself. 'It was her choice to leave her children, to take a change of clothes and go to a night club and to plan on staying in a hotel. Sentencing her, he said: 'You abandoned three little girls aged 12, six and four. The picture appears to be very clear. 'You put your own pleasure and desires before their safety and left them at great risk.' As the sentence was passed the mother wailed from the dock: 'I am so sorry, I am very sorry to everyone here. 'I will never do it again.' Judge Owen Davies . Peter Clark, prosecuting, told the court: 'There are no previous convictions but there was a police caution from four years ago for child cruelty. 'She abandoned three children aged between nine months and nine years same children and was given a police caution.' He said when officers quizzed the woman about her latest abandonment she initially said there was a babysitter back in Essex before later tearfully telling them 'I lied'. The children were taken into the police station and cared for - an experience described by the judge as 'frightening'. The court heard that the oldest daughter had been 'primed' to tell officers that their mother had only left them 20 minutes previously. Paul Vickers mitigating, said his client had suffered domestic abuse and was not able to say 'no' to her partner when he suggested that they go out together. The woman admitted a charge of wilfully assaulting, neglecting, abandoning, exposing or ill-treating children, in a way likely to cause them unnecessary suffering or injury.","Essex mother shopped then went clubbing in London .

A mother from Washington has been charged with assault after it was alleged she repeatedly put bleach into her young daughter’s eyes. Jennifer Mothershead, 29 from Bonney Lake, is thought to have caused permanent vision loss in her 15-month-old daughter’s right eye. Authorities became suspicious in May last year when the little girl was airlifted from Tacoma to Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center after suffering a blow to the head, according to Q13 FOX News. Accused: Jennifer Mothershead has been charged with assault after prosecutors alleged she put bleach into her daughter's eyes . When she was treated, medical staff observed a previously diagnosed eye condition had got worse. Doctors became suspicious that the head injury was a result of abuse and called the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department. Mothershead did not explain how her daughter had got the head injury, and according to a detective, did not show any emotion about the girl’s injuries. The 15-month-old was taken into protective custody. When hospital staff and detectives examined the girl’s eye drops that she had been using for her condition more closely, they noticed they had a strong smell. A detective tested a few drops on his wrist and said they caused a minor burning sensation. Warning signs: Medical staff at Seattle Children's Hospital were concerned that the girl's eye condition was not getting better . 'One of the things our detectives were concerned about was a lack of concern for the toddler from the mom and we started looking into it,' Pierce County Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Troyer told Q13 FOX News. 'We found one of the eye drop bottles of chemicals, which basically burned our detectives. It obviously wasn’t something that should be going in someone’s eyes.' The eye drops were sent for testing to the Food and Drug Administration’s Forensic Chemistry labs, where scientists found that they contained bleach. Explanation: Detective Ed Troyer said detectives were concerned Mothershead showed a lack of concern for her daughter . The eye injuries suffered by the little girl matched up with the symptoms of bleach exposure and she had suffered to such an extent that medical staff ruled out the possibility that the dropper had simply been cleaned with bleach. The girl's condition has improved, but doctors say she has permanently lost vision in her right eye. Now two years old, she has been living with her father since last spring. Mothershead has pleaded not guilty and her bail was set at $150,000.","Authorities became suspicious when they noticed the eye drops Jennifer Mothershead had been administering to her 15-month-old daughter had a strange odour .

A schoolgirl in so much pain she became hooked painkillers by the age of 14 has spoken of her ordeal - and how she got her life back on track. Louiselle Morris, from Cardiff, was 13 when her crippling back pain was diagnosed as scoliosis - an extreme curving of the spine. She was given a morphine-like drug for the pain, but soon became dependent on it to get through the day. It was only thanks to an intense course of physiotherapy that Louiselle, now 20, has learned to deal with the pain without medication. Louiselle Morris (with mother Susan) was given a morphine-like opiate for her excruciating back pain, but by the age of 14 was relying on four tramadol and eight paracetemol a day . Her problems began at the age of 13 when she went to the doctor with what she thought was a common cold. Instead, she was shocked to learn that her back was severely bent and she was suffering from scoliosis. She was told that left untreated, it could lead to fatal heart and lung problems. Her spine had a 48 degree curve and there was a risk that her rib cage could shift and move her internal organs. The only treatment for the chronic condition was a high risk operation where two metal rods would be stuck into her spine and then fused solid. But her condition was borderline and doctors also refused to operate because she was in too much pain. Louiselle Morris has scoliosis - an extreme curving of the spine . Within months, she was suffering from chronic pain and could not walk more than 50 metres or go to school without collapsing. Her mother Susan, 499, said: 'Three months after she was diagnosed, Louiselle had changed. She had gone from being a typical, active teenage girl to living life as an 80-year-old woman, confined to the four walls of her bedroom. 'She would try walking around, lying on her back and on her front, but nothing helped.' Doctors prescribed Louiselle a strong painkiller, Tramadol, to cope. The drug is similar to morphine and is only used as a short term answer to chronic pain. Yet she was so reliant on painkillers that she was taking four Tramadol and eight paracetemol every day. Her mother said: 'She was in a terrible state, it was horrendous. 'She lost so much confidence and I was desperate. I tried everything to get her off the medication. 'To see her in so much pain was so scary. I would have driven to the end of the world to try and help her. 'I felt so let down by the people who should have helped me. How could they leave a child to get into this state? How could they allow a teenage girl to become reliant on drugs?' Louiselle said: 'I was sleeping and I just didn't see a way out of it. I couldn't see how the situation was going to resolve itself. 'I was just trying to cope with the here and now and that was the only way I could at that time.' Her mother added: 'By the time I found a clinic that could help Louiselle, I was at breaking point. 'I remember speaking to the clinic, Scoliosis SOS, who understood everything I was saying. They knew how I felt as a parent and how traumatic it could be for the child involved.' They drove six hours to the clinic with Louiselle doubled over in pain on the back seat of the car. Four days after the consultation, she was put on an intensive exercise therapy course, comprising six hours of strengthening and stretching each day for four weeks. She was also prescribed individual physiotherapy treatment and taught more about scoliosis and the effect it has on the body. Louiselle said: 'I was going through withdrawal because I had been taking so many tablets. It was one of the worst pains you can imagine. 'My whole body felt like it was turning in on me, it was absolutely horrendous. 'I was throwing up violently for about a week and had nausea and muscular cramps.' It was only thanks to an intense course of physiotherapy that Louiselle, now 20, has learned to deal with the pain without medication . By the end of the second week of therapy, Louiselle was off the painkillers. Her mother said: 'Tramadol is so highly addictive and the person taking it has to want to stop, or else you haven't got a hope in hell. 'We got her down to one tramadol a day. Stopping her take the last one was such a battle but she realised how important it was to stop. She said to me, ""right, it's going to go in the bin"".' Louiselle said: 'The exercise therapy changed my life. I have no idea where I would have been if my mum had not found the centre when she did. 'I could not do anything and my whole life was just slipping away from me.' Her pain had been caused by an imbalance of the muscles and after her muscles had been strengthened and stretched, it had almost disappeared, from excruciating to a dull ache. She returns to the clinic every two months for a 'top-up' session and instead of numbing the pain with drugs, she now exercises or takes a hot bath to ease her aching back. Louiselle said: 'I can now manage a day without feeling like I've been hit by a sledgehammer. 'My . school attendance was erratic and I couldn't walk more than 500 metres. Since the physiotherapy I can go to university and to work without . being in too much pain. 'The clinic has given me the confidence . to believe in myself. I feel like I am in control again and scoliosis no . longer rules my life.' Doctors at the clinic have since told the 20-year-old that her back looks better than it would have if she'd had surgery. Louiselle returns to the London clinic every couple of months for a two-hour session with a highly qualified specialist to review her progress and keep her on track. She is now studying psychology at Cardiff Metropolitan University and wants to help other young girls. She said: 'I have loved every second of university and I really do put my happiness down to these exercises. 'I don't feel like a hunchback anymore. I am normal and I can finally look forward to my future.' For more information: www.scoliosisSOS.com .","Louiselle Morris was diagnosed with scoliosis - extreme curving of the spine .

'It's time to get behind one candidate and get the job done so we can move on to the next challenge, bringing us one step closer to defeating Barack Obama.' Keep smiling: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was given a drawing of himself on the campaign trail in Illinois. He beat rival Rick Santorum in the Puerto Rico primary . Victory: Mitt and Ann Romney both spoke after his win in the Puerto Rico primary on Sunday night . Late on Sunday night, with 61 per cent of the Puerto Rican votes counted, Romney had 83 per cent of them. He won all 20 delegates to the . national convention at stake because he prevailed with more than 50 . percent of the vote. That padded his comfortable lead over Santorum in . the race to amass the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Romney announced the Puerto Rico win . at the Illinois rally and told the crowd, 'I intend to become our . nominee and I intend to get Latino voters to vote for a Republican and . take back the White House.' The Santorum campaign accused Romney . of pandering. 'Mitt Romney says he supports English as the official . language of America while on the mainland, but then says Puerto Ricans . don't have to learn English while he's on Puerto Rico,' Santorum . communications director Hogan Gidley said in a press release. OK by me in America: Today, Santorum slipped and called Puerto Rico a Spanish-speaking country . Behind: Rick Santorum's controversial remarks about English and Spanish damaged his chances in Puerto Rico . As the day began, Santorum claimed he was in contest for the long haul because Romney is a weak front-runner. 'This is a primary process where . somebody had a huge advantage, huge money advantage, huge advantage of . establishment support and he hasn't been able to close the deal and even . come close to closing the deal,' Santorum said. 'That tells you that . there's a real flaw there.' Yet Santorum sidestepped when asked if . he would fight Romney on the convention floor if he failed before . August to stop the former Massachusetts governor from getting the . required number of delegates. Romney, in turn, expressed confidence that he'd prevail. 'I can't tell you exactly how the process is going to work,' Romney said. 'But I bet I'm going to become the nominee.' Both campaigned in Puerto Rico last . week - in a campaign focused on statehood for the U.S. territory - but . Romney cut short his trip so he could head to Illinois and Santorum . spent Sunday in Louisiana. Illinois, a more moderate Midwestern . state, votes on Tuesday and is seen as more friendly territory for . Romney, while Santorum is the favorite in the more conservative Southern . state of Louisiana, which votes on Saturday. X marks the spot: Puerto Rico's Governor Luis Fortuno shows his ballot to the press after marking it with an 'X' under the photo of Mitt Romney during the Republican presidential primary election . After the Puerto Rico victory, Romney . had 521 delegates in his camp and Santorum had 253, according to The . Associated Press's tally. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich trailed . with 136 delegates and Texas Rep. Ron Paul had 50. Enrique Melendez, the Republican . representative on the Puerto Rican State Electoral Commission, told the . AP that Romney 'won the Puerto Rican primary by a huge margin and we are . granting him the 20 delegates.' At this rate, Romney is on pace to . capture the nomination in June unless Santorum or Gingrich is able to . win decisively in the coming contests. Both have said they would stay in the . race and perhaps force the nomination to a fight at the GOP's convention . in Tampa if Romney doesn't amass enough delegates to arrive with a . mandate. That would turn the convention into an intra-party brawl for . the first time since 1976. Even as Santorum declined to commit to . forcing a brokered convention, his advisers were working behind the . scenes on a plan to persuade convention delegates to switch candidates . if the former Pennsylvania senator fails to derail Romney before that. Inevitable? Mitt Romney is seeking to cast his candidacy as unstoppable in an effort to end the race quickly . Romney's aides call this a fantasy scenario even as they try to prevent delegates from defecting. Half of the states have yet to weigh . in on a race with seemingly no end in sight anytime soon. That's . prompted fresh speculation within the GOP over whether a contested . convention is likely. Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus insisted that party will have a nominee sooner rather than later. 'We're only at halftime,' Priebus . said. 'I think that this process is going to play itself out. We will . have a nominee, I think, fairly soon - one, two months away.' In Puerto Rico, the race was focused . on the issue of statehood, and Melendez said, 'This proves Governor . Romney's electability and his ability to reach out to Hispanics and . minorities.' Whether that's true or not, Romney . told Puerto Ricans he would support statehood while Santorum said . English would have to be the official language of the island if it were . to join the United States - a statement that roiled residents. 'In Puerto Rico, we get along fine . with both languages,' said Francisco Rodriguez, a 76-year-old architect . who supported Romney and hopes Puerto Rico becomes the nation's 51st . state. Support: One of the reality TV Duggar clan hands out campaign signs at a Santorum rally . Even as Puerto Rico voted, Romney and Santorum traded barbs from afar. 'Senator Santorum has the same . economic lightweight background the president has,' Romney told a crowd . in Moline, Illinois. He went a step further in Rockford, saying, 'We're . not going to replace an economic lightweight with another economic . lightweight.' That drew a Santorum retort: 'If Mitt Romney's an economic heavyweight, we're in trouble.' Aside from a pair of TV interviews, . Santorum spent the day visiting a pair of churches in Louisiana, sharing . how his faith has shaped his political career and his opposition to . abortion rights and gay marriage. He didn't mention Romney or any of his . other Republican opponents during talks at both churches. He made clear he didn't plan to exit . the race anytime soon, saying in Bossier City, Louisiana, 'One of the . great blessings I've had in every political campaign is people . underestimate me, people underestimate what God can do.' But he was curt when asked about his . odds in Illinois. 'Keep working,' Santorum said after services there. 'That's all we can do.'","Romney won all 20 delegates from the U.S. territory .

A fifth of income tax goes straight to funding Britain’s vast benefits bill, new figures show as Tory MPs step up their call for more cuts to welfare. The average taxpayer now spends more than £1,100 each on benefits, excluding pensions, while a further £370 goes on paying interest on the nation’s debts. Chancellor George Osborne is coming under Cabinet pressure ahead of this month’s Budget to find more savings from welfare as ministers resist deeper cuts to defence, police and business. Scroll down for video . Official Treasury figures show the average income tax payer sees 22 per cent of the tax go on beneifts . David Cameron yesterday defended cutting benefits, saying the country would not be able to afford to fund care for the elderly if the nation is 'squandering billions on welfare for people who could work'. Speaking in West Yorkshire, the Prime Minister said there was no ‘magic money tree’ that allowed the Government to spend and borrow more. As early as next year, every taxpayer . will get a personal annual statement revealing how each pound taken from . them by the Revenue is spent. However . a breakdown released in a parliamentary question shows that welfare . payments, not including the bill for the state pension, account for 22.4 . per cent of income tax paid – worth £1,166.32 for the average worker. Treasury minister David Gauke revealed debt interest payments amount to 7.1 per cent of income tax . bills, or £369.91. Speaking at precision grinding engineers Kinetic Landis Ltd, Mr Cameron said warned there was no 'magic money tree' to fund tax cuts or spending . Downing Street has made clear that . £3.5billion of extra cuts to welfare were announced in last year’s . Autumn Statement, and do not necessarily expect more. However, Tory MPs believe taking the axe to benefits will be more popular with voters than cutting spending elsewhere. Mr . Osborne will deliver his fourth Budget on March 20, as Cabinet . colleagues battle it out to defend their departments from more cuts. The revelation that one pound in five of our income tax goes on benefits will alarm those demanding the axe between to the welfare state. Tory MP Robert Halfon said the figures showed the need to cut welfare more . Tory MP Rob Halfon, who obtained the . figures, told MailOnline, said: ‘These figures from the government show . the astonishing amount of tax low earners are paying for welfare . benefits. ‘The Labour party want to impose a . further welfare tax on low earners by spending billions more on benefits . and oppose every measure the government takes to try to cut low . earners’ tax bills. ‘These figures are why we need to continue to reform welfare urgently.’ Mr Halfon warned against increasing . public spending in any areas, adding: ‘We should reallocate existing . spending on tax cuts, for cutting fuel duel duty for example.’ In a major speech on the economy yesterday, Mr Cameron refused to change course but hinted at further welfare cuts. He rejected the accusation from opponents, including the Labour party, that the government is ploughing ahead with austerity to make 'the numbers add up with no care whatsoever for what it means for people affected by the changes we make'. The Prime Minister said: 'Nothing could be further from the truth.  My motives for sticking to the plan are exactly about doing the right thing to help families and business up and down the country. 'Why? Because we want to look after people in their old age, and we won’t be able to do that if we’re squandering billions on welfare for people who could work. 'Because we want to help people into work and break the cycle of poverty, and we’ve seen that ever increasing working-age welfare is not the answer.' Mr Osborne has faced resistance from senior ministers over demands for more cuts to their budgets from 2015. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said at the weekend that there is a ‘body of opinion within Cabinet who believes that we have to look at the welfare budget again’. He added that he would resist further cuts to the defence budget, and would not offer more troop number reductions in the 2015-16 spending review. Home Secretary Theresa May is also resisting further cuts to her budget. Mr Osborne is understood to be 'relaxed' about Cabinet ministers 'fighting it out amongst themselves' over where future spending cuts should fall. A Treasury source said: 'We have been clear that if we want to do less on cutting departments we have to do more on cutting welfare because the overall envelope is set.' Mr Osborne is under pressure to ease the cost of living. Using 2005 as a baseline, the Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation has risen markedly, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics . However, Business Secretary Vince Cable has broken ranks to suggest capital spending, funded by borrowing, may be needed to kick-start growth. He told the New Statesman that the Government’s decision to stick to Labour’s plan to cut capital spending was a mistake which had ‘economic consequences’. Mr Cable said there was now a legitimate debate about whether the Government should ‘borrow more, at very low interest rates, in order to finance more capital spending - building of schools and colleges, small road and rail projects, more prudential borrowing by councils for house building.’ He told the magazine that the strategy ‘does not undermine the central objective of reducing the structural deficit, and may assist it by reviving growth’. The Prime Minister warned abandoning Plan A would mean interest rates will rise, homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bust . Mr Cable also launched a withering attack on the Tory Right, describing their analysis of Britain’s economic problems as a ‘saloon-bar whine about health and safety inspectors, newts and birds that block new development, bloody-minded workers, equalities legislation and Eurocrats who dream up regulations for square tomatoes and straight bananas.’ He said the coalition had been right to clamp down on spending more broadly in order to restore market confidence in the UK. The Prime Minister warned abandoning Plan A would mean interest rates will rise, homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bust . However, Mr Cameron used his pre-Budget speech to warn Britain must stick to its deficit reduction programme or risk being plunged ‘back into the abyss’. 'There are some people who think we don't have to take all these tough decisions to deal with our debts,' he said. 'They say that our focus on deficit reduction is damaging growth. And what we need to do is to spend more and borrow more. 'It's as if they think there's some magic money tree. Well, let me tell you a plain truth: there isn't.'Margaret Thatcher understood that a tax cut paid for by borrowed money is no tax cut at all when she said: ""I’ve not been prepared, ever, to go on with tax reductions if it meant unsound finance"".' Mr Cameron added: 'So yes, we are doing a great deal to help hard working families.  But all of these changes have to be paid for – and they have been paid for.' The remarks will be seen as a sharp rebuttal to the calls from both Tories and Lib Dems for a change of direction.","Average worker sees 22.4% of their income tax spent on benefits, not including the state pension .

The body of a 52-year-old woman who fell to her death in the Pyrenees was devoured by Griffon vultures before emergency services were able to retrieve it. Furious locals are demanding that authorities take action against the endangered carrion-eaters after they left only the woman's bones, clothes and shoes for burial. Fear of the birds has been growing in recent years, which have reportedly also begun attacking live animals since a European edict that dead livestock must not be left in the fields. Protected: A Griffon vulture in flight. The body of a 52-year-old woman who fell 1,000ft to her death in the Pyrenees was devoured by the carrion eaters before emergency services were able to retrieve it . Farmers want to be given the right to shoot the protected birds, which they say have started to prey on live sheep and cows. The campaign is gathering pace after the latest incident, in which a woman slipped and fell down a 1,000ft slope on the Pic de Pista after taking a short cut while walking with two friends. Major Didier Pericou of the gendarmerie told The Times that they believed the woman died in the fall, but added that there was little left of her by the time a search party found her body. 'When we first went out in the helicopter looking for the body, we saw numerous vultures without realising what they were doing,' he said. 'There were only bones, clothes and shoes left on the ground. 'They took 40 to 50 minutes to eat the body.' 'Conservation issue': An EC ruling that dead animals must be burned due to danger of BSE transmission has critically lowered the vultures' food supply . The incident is the latest in a series to cast the griffon vulture in a villanous light, which has prompted rural French and Spanish of the region to ask for the right to shoot the protected birds. For centuries, the Pyrenean farmers lived in symbiotic harmony with the griffon vulture. Wheeling over their flocks and fields, the birds were seen as neither a threat nor even a nuisance, but as a vital part of the ecosystem. When farmers had to dispose of a dead animal, they would simply take it to one of hundreds of carcass dumps scattered across the moutains where the scavengers gathered to do their work. But now, after an EC ruling that dead animals must be burned due to the danger of BSE transmission, the vultures' food supply has been critically lowered and they have been forced to spread further afield. Fear of vultures has been growing in recent years as they have spread from their mountain eyries. French . news weekly Le Nouvel Observateur, in 2007 reported of 'mutant . vultures', with one woman saying that a group of the birds, whose . wingspans can exceed seven feet, gathered menacingly near to where her . children were sitting. One . farmer, Alain Larralde, said he saw a group of vultures attack and start . eating an adult cow. There have been reports of live animals carried . off. 'You can't imagine what it is like to see an animal eaten alive,' Mr Larralde was reported to have said. But ornithologists say the real threat is not posed by the birds, but rather to them. Grahame . Madge, European bird of prey expert at the Royal Society for the . Protection of Birds, said: 'We are seeing three-figure vulture flocks . over Belgium and Holland. These birds are fanning out across Europe in . search of food. 'There is a conservation issue here.'","Carrion-eaters swooped on the woman after she fell from the Pic de Pista .

Kim Henningsen, editor-in-chief of Denmark's Se & Hoer magazine said he intends to publish 70 topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge . Police yesterday raided the offices of French magazine Closer in the hunt for the photographer who took topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge. Detectives confirmed they were looking for evidence at Closer’s  Paris headquarters ‘which might lead to the identity’ of the paparazzi photographer responsible. But as they searched for evidence a Swedish magazine was publishing the intimate photographs. And a Danish celebrity weekly publication called Se Og Hor (See And Hear) announced that it was planning to reproduce over 60 photos today spread across a 16-page supplement. Kim Henningsen, Se Og Hor’s editor in chief, declined to say who sold the photographs or how much was paid for them. But the news underlined fears that the landmark injunction won by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 48 hours ago will do little to halt the worldwide spread of the pictures. St James’s Palace said it was aware of the Danish magazine’s plans, but reissued a statement made at the weekend, saying: ‘As we’ve said, we will not be commenting on potential legal action concerning the alleged intended publication of the photos save to say that all proportionate responses will be kept under review.’ William and Kate have won a court order banning French Closer – which first published the topless photos in what French judges said was a ‘brutal’ invasion of privacy – from selling or republishing the photographs, under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine. Stop-off: The Duke and Duchess made a brief stop at Brisbane Airport in Australia today on their way back to England . Smiling: The Royal couple wave to cheering and probably surprised people as they walk through the airport . However, it is the unknown . photographer – not the magazine – who is thought to own the copyright to . the photographs, and there is as yet nothing to prevent them from . continuing to cash in on the controversial images. With French authorities so far unable . to discover the name of the person who took the photographs at a chateau . in the south of France, there is no injunction banning him or her . selling the pictures in France or around the world. Christophe Bigot, a barrister who . specialises in media law, questioned the legality of the Paris raid – . suggesting it had been authorised solely because members of the Royal . Family were involved. Journalistic sources, including photographers, are strictly protected by French law. ‘A law of January 2, 2010, protects . the confidentiality of sources, as do numerous decisions of the European . Court of Human Rights,’ said Mr Bigot. ‘In the case of William and . Kate, I do not see how a prosecutor could justify a search of Closer.’ Storm: Police closed the building of French Closer magazine after the pictures appeared in an issue last week. Right: Denmarks Denmark's Se & Hoer, magazine has said he intends to print 70 pictures . A police source close to the case said . the raid – carried out by officers from the Paris Judicial Police . working under the instructions of prosecutors – had been authorised by a . ‘judicial request’ for information, specifically the name of the . photographer involved. The pictures are already widely . available on the internet and have been printed in Ireland’s Daily Star . newspaper and Italy’s Chi magazine. Earlier this week it was revealed that photographer Valerie Suau filmed the Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing at the French chateau . And any financial penalty Closer might . incur will be heavily outweighed by a massive rise in revenue and . circulation: the Kate topless pictures issue sold 500,000 copies, about . 100,000 more than usual. Mr Henningsen says his Danish magazine . was offered 240 photographs but is using only 60 or 70. They will be . available only in the print version of the magazine, not published on . its website. He reportedly told one Copenhagen . newspaper that the French injunction did not affect his magazine as he . had been in possession of the photographs for several days before the . Paris court ruling. He said: ‘It’s a set of unique photos . from an A-class celebrity. We are a leading gossip magazine in Denmark, . and it is my job to publish them. ‘If the British royal family want to sue us, then it will happen and we’ll deal with it. ‘Our readers love to follow the lives . of celebrities and royals and are always looking for news that brings . them up close. It is in Se Og Hor’s DNA to entertain and satisfy our . readers’ curiosity. ‘Therefore it is always relevant for . us when a duchess and the future queen of England is topless and . willingly reveals her breasts towards a public road.’ The magazine’s sister publication in Sweden, Se & Hor, published 11 of the Kate photos yesterday. ‘It is nothing new to us to publish . nude photos of celebrities on holiday,’ said its chief editor Carina . Lofkvist, who added that the pictures were bought last Friday ‘from . photographers and photo agencies, the way we always do’ and ‘before . everything erupted’.

A teenager has been jailed for just three years after killing his friend in a horrific crash after crashing into a field where he rolled his car after driving at speeds of up to 101mph. David Powell, 20, was killed when Joseph Salah-Eldin, 19, drove his Vauxhall Corsa near Kings Lynn in Norfolk last September. A court heard Salah-Eldin, who had only been driving for a couple of months, was almost twice the drink drive limit and was changing the radio when his car careered off the road and overturned. It killed Mr Powell instantly and left two other passengers with injuries. Horror:  Drunk teenage driver Joseph Salah-Eldin, left, was doing up to 101mph in a 40mph zone when he smashed into a field and killed his best friend David Powell, 20, right . Yesterday, Salah-Eldin was jailed for three years four months. He was also . banned from driving for five years after he admitted causing death by . careless driving when unfit through drink. After seeing Salah-Eldin jailed yesterday, Mr Powell's grief-stricken family . gave a statement. 'Sudden car crash . tragedies, caused by speeding and alcohol, devastate families and change . lives forever. 'No-one can foresee the impact of the loss, grief, anger, bewilderment and heartbreak of losing a loved one so suddenly. 'Cars, . alcohol and young men are a lethal combination and young drivers and . passengers need to be aware of the destruction this can cause - not only . to those involved in collisions, but the families and loved ones left . behind. New driver: Salah-Eldin had passed his test just two months before he caused the crash. His wrecked Vauxhall Corsa is pictured following the incident . 'Our family has been robbed of its future, our son robbed of his life - so many dreams and plans unfulfilled.' The catastrophic crash happened just after midnight on the A149 at Heacham, near King's Lynn. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Salah-Eldin, of Dersingham, lost control about 60 metres into a 40mph zone . Mr Youell said: 'The only vehicle in the area at that time was the vehicle being driven by the defendant. 'There was no reason for that vehicle to leave the road at that time other than the admitted careless driving of the defendant.' He said Salah-Eldin had only passed his test at the third attempt two months before the crash. Mr Youell said he was travelling at an 'excessive speed' and 'adjusting the sound system in the car' at the time. Salah-Eldin swerved across the road before hitting a pavement, hedge and repeatedly rolling before ending up on its roof in a field. Mr Powell, a back seat passenger, . suffered a head injury and died instantly. Another friend in the car . sustained bruising and a broken finger and another a broken nose. Justice: Mr Powell's family are pictured leaving court after seeing Salah-Eldin jailed yesterday . Mr Youell said . Salah-Eldin, who suffered a dislocated shoulder, was believed to be . driving between 74mph and 101mph when he crashed. He said he had been drinking with friends at Dersingham Social Club earlier that fateful night.Salah-Eldin was breath tested by police and had 65mcg of alcohol in 100mls of breath. The legal limit is 35. Jailing him at Norwich Crown Court, judge Stephen Holt told him: 'No words I can say will possibly help the friends and family. It's an utter tragedy that has occurred.' The . judge added: 'It's said time and time again in these courts that young . drivers who speed cause these sort of terrible events which ruin . people's lives.' Judge Holt said that cases like this go to show 'just how dangerous it is for anyone, let alone young drivers, to be drinking'. Mr Youell read out a statement on behalf of Mr Powell's shattered mother Margaret. She said the family had been 'devastated' by his death. Mr Powell was a chef at Sandringham visitors' centre and was 'proud' to have worked on the Queen's grand estate - at the request of a senior member of the royal family. Mr Youell said the death of Mr Powell, who wanted to be a 'policeman and father', had left a 'huge hole' in the life of his family, including parents, sister and girlfriend. Jonathan Morgans, defending, said Salah-Eldin wanted to express his 'remorse' and say sorry. Locked up: Salah-Eldin was jailed for three years four months at Norwich Crown Court yesterday . Mr Morgans said: 'He takes full responsibility for his actions and the result of his actions is that his best friend has died. He misses him and it's his fault. There's nothing he can do to turn back the clock but his remorse is total as is his regret. 'He has real insight into the family's loss because he shares it. To apologise can only ever be inadequate but it's heartfelt and sincere. He will have to live with the consequences of his actions forever.' Steve Matthews, senior investigating officer with Norfolk Police Serious Collision Investigation Team, said Salah-Eldin was a newly-qualified driver. He said that combined with alcohol and excessive speed was a 'recipe for disaster'. Chief Inspector Chris Spinks, of Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit, said: 'This tragic incident has had an enormous impact on the lives of all those involved, their friends and their families. 'One young man has had his life cut short, and another faces time in prison and must live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. Two other young men have experienced first-hand the dangers of drinking and driving.' Every high school and college in Norfolk is now being urged by police to educate young drivers in a bid to prevent accidents. Salah-Eldin was told he must serve half his sentence before being released on licence.","Joseph Salah-Eldin, 19, lost control of car as he fixed the sound system .

Accused: Leeds United youth player Simon Lenighan is standing trial over the alleged rape of a woman in a city centre hotel . A Leeds United youth team player raped a drunk woman in a hotel after a night out and filmed the attack on a mobile phone, a court heard. Simon Lenighan, 18, is alleged to have carried out the sex attack on the woman with another man, Nathan Campbell, 23, in the Etap Hotel in Leeds. Leeds Crown Court heard the woman was woken by a chambermaid the next morning and had no idea where she was how she got there. The court heard that Lenighan and Campbell had left and her mobile phone and money were missing. Police were contacted and video footage was found on Campbell's mobile phone, the court was told. Robin Mairs, prosecuting, said: 'What we say is both Campbell and Lenighan used their video phones to film (the woman) while she lay naked in bed.' Mr Mairs said the men were laughing on the video but did not want to be seen on camera. He added: 'This video, the Crown says, is more than simply a sordid souvenir of what happened in that hotel room. It is more than a lack of decency.' Lenighan, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice. Campbell, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape, one of sexual assault and perverting the course of justice. Mr Mairs said Lenighan and Campbell met each other for the first time on the night of the alleged incident, August 29 last year, when they were drinking in the Tiger Tiger bar in Leeds. The woman, who knew Lenighan, had also been drinking in the bar and agreed to go back to the hotel with the two men. Mr Mairs said the girl had been drinking vodka and friends had been concerned for her safety because she had so much to drink. Young star: Lenighan, 18, is a youth team player for Leeds who play at Elland Road (pictured) The jury heard staff at the Etap, which is now the Ibis hotel, noticed that the woman was 'particularly drunk' and the two men appeared 'more sober' when they checked in at 4.15am. One worker was so concerned that he followed them to the room and listened at the door but couldn't hear anything and left. After they were arrested both men claimed the woman was a willing partner in the sexual intercourse that took place between them. Mr Mairs said: 'If someone becomes so intoxicated, so drunk, that they no longer have the capacity to choose, then there cannot be any meaningful consent.' The case continues. [preview] .

"By . Steve Robson . PUBLISHED: . 05:48 EST, 29 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:43 EST, 29 November 2012 . Child abuser Sir Cyril Smith admitted spanking young boys when interviewed by detectives in the 1960s, it was claimed today. A former detective who investigated the former MP said he believes he would have confessed to his guilt if he had been put on trial. The claims emerged as the MP's autobiography reveals he was friends with the late DJ Jimmy Saville - also accused of being a serial paedophile. Friends: Sir Cyril Smith revealed in his autiobiography how he had met Jimmy Savile at a medieval banquet when he joined in communal singing in 1977. He impressed the late DJ so much he was invited to appear on his BBC show Clunk Clink . According to the Sun, Smith wrote in his 1977 autobiography Big Cyril: 'I once attended a medieval banquet at Worsely, Lancashire, along with Jimmy Savile. When I joined the community singing, Jimmy blurted out, 'You've got a nice voice there Cyril, you must come on my programme!' 'That's how I ended up singing 'She's a Lassie from Lancashire' on Clunk Clink. He continued: 'Jimmy Savile openly admits that his work as a disc jockey is a joke, but his record of public service and charity must be unequalled.' It was revealed yesterday how prosecutors missed three chances to convict Smith for indecent assault, despite the fact detectives 40 years ago were convinced he was guilty. His original file was passed back to the police by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 1970, arguing the allegations were too old, not corroborated and made by boys with dubious characters. Today, a retired officer told how he was drafted in to investigate Smith a year earlier, when the Rochdale force was absorbed into Lancashire Constabulary. He said that another detective who previously worked on the case, Rochdale-based Derek Wheater, had warned him his attempts to expose Smith had been ‘blocked’ at every turn by influential friends of the politician. Instead, Mr Wheater wanted a new officer - one not already known in the town - to take over and have another attempt. The ex-detective, who asked not to be named, said: 'He said they had made numerous attempts to investigate Cyril Smith but was getting obstructed by dignitaries. He said you are unknown officers and may fare better.' Over the following months, he compiled a dossier on the politician which he believed proved his guilt. He said: 'He didn’t deny certain things. He admitted he spanked them - his last words were ‘this will kill my mother’. 'We had enough, I think. To be quite honest I think if it had gone to trial he would have had admitted it. It suggested he was scared.' Missed opportunities: Both Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said if Smith, right, had been accused today he would be charged and prosecuted . In a striking similarity to Jimmy Savile, bachelor Smith lived with his mother Eva until her death in 1994. When he became mayor of Rochdale in the 1960s, she was his lady mayoress. The retired detective, who was based at Whitefield, said that, just as he was completing the investigation, he was forced to hand over the file to senior officers from force HQ - and never saw or heard of it again. Shortly afterwards the DPP marked it ‘no further action’. Meanwhile, a former special branch officer claimed the file eventually landed in his office because it was so politically sensitive. Tony Robinson, based at Preston at the time, said: 'You can imagine them saying: ‘What are we going to do with this? It’s a bit of a political hot potato, send it to special branch, get it buried’.' He said he eventually received a call in around 1977 - when Smith’s Liberal party was hoping to form a pact with the Labour government - from MI5 ordering him to send it to London via a personal courier. He added: 'It’s plain to see why MI5 wanted the file. Cyril Smith was being investigated for a position at the top table.' Yesterday, alleged victim Chris Marshall said he was just seven or eight when he was sexually abused by Smith at a notorious school for vulnerable boys. Abused: Chris Marshall, left, says he was just seven or eight when he was sexually abused by Sir Cyril Smith at a notorious school for vulnerable boys in Rochdale . Mr Marshall, now 40, moved into Knowl View in Rochdale in 1979. Just months later, he says, he was forced to perform a sex act on Smith – known to the pupils as ‘the fat man’ – after being ‘summoned’ from his dormitory in the dead of night. He said: ‘A member of staff came up and took me from the room. He took me into this flat. The fat man was on the bed and another kid was there too. ‘We were told to go back afterwards to our rooms, not to wake anybody else up and have a good breakfast in the morning. ‘It was a dreadful, dreadful experience but I was so confused I didn’t tell anyone until much later. But the school was rife with this type of behaviour and there were all sorts of sexual things going on.’ After the abuse, he begged staff for his own room. When he got his wish, he slept with a chair against the door so no-one could get in. Mr Marshall said that it was only when he was in his teens and saw photos of the high-profile politician in a newspaper that he realised who his abuser was. He said: ‘It was definitely Cyril Smith. The truth is he was a child abuser and targeted vulnerable children. People need to know this is what he was – he was a paedophile.’ Smith died in 2010, having retired as an MP in 1992. Two alleged victims of Sir Cyril Smith are considering legal action against Rochdale council for abuse suffered in a boys’ hostel. The . men - both now in their 60s - have approached Manchester legal firm Pannone in the hope of winning compensation. They say they were molested . as teenagers by Smith while living at Cambridge House hostel. The council says it is looking into its involvement in the hostel, which was set up by Smith in 1962. It was largely set up using cash from the local . Rotary Club, but was also given a council grant on its foundation, according to the Manchester Evening News. However, in 1965 the council refused to give a larger grant - thought to be around £700 - and the hostel shut. One . of the alleged victims, now 67, made allegations of abuse to police at . the time. The second had not previously come forward, taking the tally . of people who claim they were abused by Smith to 13. A spokesman for Pannone said it is investigating the extent of the council’s involvement. Linda . Fisher, director of corporate services at the council, said: 'The . sexual abuse of children is an awful crime carried about by the worst . kind of criminals. 'Cambridge . House was a privately-run care home and we have contacted the solicitor . quoted in the media to clarify the details behind the claims being made . against the council. 'We encourage anyone with allegations to contact Greater Manchester Police so they can be looked into immediately.'","Former detective says Smith 'didn't deny certain things'

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:25 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:14 EST, 23 April 2013 . A tour of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum begins in a bright area representing his early domestic agenda, but with one turn, visitors find themselves in a darkened room surrounded by chilling reminders of the September 11 terrorist attacks. This contrast, symbolizing Bush's abrupt shift in priorities less than eight months into his first term, is among the most poignant exhibits at a museum being dedicated this week that also chronicles the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Hurricane Katrina, the Florida recount and various other historical events. Bush told The Associated Press last week that he wanted to make sure the part of the museum devoted to 9/11 was powerful enough to remind visitors of how much the world changed that day. '43': The George W. Bush Presidential Center, which includes the library and museum along with the 43rd president's policy institute, will be dedicated Thursday on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas . 'It's very emotional and very profound,' Bush said. 'One of the reasons it has to be is because memories are fading rapidly and the profound impact of that attack is becoming dim with time, and we want to make sure people remember not only the lives lost and the courage shown but the lesson that the human condition overseas matters to the national security of our country.' The George W. Bush Presidential Center, which includes the library and museum along with the 43rd president's policy institute, will be dedicated Thursday on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. All the living presidents, including President Barack Obama and Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, plan to attend. It will open to the public on May 1. Thursday: The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, pictured, in Dallas opens to the public on May 1 . 9/11: A large part of the exhibit is dedicated to the 9/11 terrorist attacks . World Trade Center: Twisted steel beams from the devastated World Trade Center site in New York are displayed in the museum area at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas . Memorabilia: Various campaign memorabilia is shown in the museum area at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas . The museum uses everything from news . clips to interactive screens to artifacts to tell the story of Bush's . eight years in office. A container of chads — the remnants of the famous . Florida punch cards — is part of an exhibit about the 2000 election, . which Bush won after the Supreme Court ordered Florida to stop its . recount process more than a month after Election Day. In the 9/11 display, called the 'Day of Fire,' video images from the attacks flash around a twisted metal beam recovered from the wreckage of the World Trade Center. The exhibit also includes the bullhorn Bush used days later to address a crowd of rescue workers at ground zero: 'I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.' Longtime Bush adviser Karen Hughes was standing just a few feet away from the president when he began making the unplanned speech. Hughes said she remembers turning to Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Joe Allbaugh and saying, 'That's going to be in his library someday.' Brendan Miniter, who served as the liaison for the Bushes as the museum's exhibits were developed, said the idea was to present the facts and 'let them speak for themselves.' He said they also did not want to shy away from more controversial aspects of the administration. 'I suspect that people would have thought that we wouldn't have talked about say enhanced interrogation techniques or the decision to create the prison in Guantanamo,' he said, adding that former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is featured in a video about why the administration felt both were necessary. Remembered: The museum uses everything from news clips to interactive screens to artifacts to tell the story of Bush's eight years in office . Katrina: Hurricane Katrina is another major event that is remembered in the museum . Free people: In this photo taken April 16, 2013, an exhibit displaying various images of freedom and democracy are seen in the museum area . Football: A football presented to president George W. Bush by the University of Texas Longhorns among the items . Visitors also are taken through a timeline of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. A display at the end makes the case against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, including that he ignored 17 United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding he disclose his weapons programs and fired at British and American pilots monitoring the U.N.-imposed no-fly zone. The exhibit also acknowledges the biggest controversy about the justification for war: No weapons of mass destruction were found. A 'Decision Points Theater,' lined with rows of interactive screens, seeks to put visitors in the shoes of a president. It provides facts for them to decide such questions as whether to invade Iraq or provide bailout money during the financial crisis. 'It's conflicting,' Miniter said. 'You go to the Capitol Hill and somebody will say you need to provide some resources to stabilize the financial industry, and then somebody else will say no, work let it work itself out, don't do anything.' First pets: Statues of Barney, left, and Miss Beazley, the beloved Scottish Terriers of president George W. Bush and Laura Bush, are included in the exhibit . Letters: Letters written from around the world and sent to the White House offering thoughts and prayers after the 9/11 attacks are displayed in the museum area of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas . Dedication: The George W. Bush Presidential Center, which includes the library and museum along with 43rd president's policy institute, will be dedicated Thursday on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas . Open: The museum will open to the public on May 1 . A 'Freedom Wall' in the museum features pictures including a soldier greeting children, former first lady Laura Bush supporting women's rights and the Bushes meeting with freedom advocates. The impact of AIDS around the world — a focus of Bush's international outreach efforts — is illustrated with a large map of the world. Small photographs of the faces of those suffering from the disease are placed into the shapes of the continents of the world, with those with more AIDS cases, including Africa, looming larger. The museum also features a section on life at the White House, displaying a ball that obviously got some heavy use by the Bushes' late dog Barney. A full-scale replica of the Oval Office leads outside to an actual rose garden. The center also features a 15-acre park recreating a Texas prairie. Bush said his focus will continue to be the George W. Bush Institute, which has featured programs focused on education, economic growth, global health and human freedom. Through the institute, his activities have included yearly bike rides with wounded military veterans and traveling to Africa as part of an effort among several groups to fight cervical and breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa. He also recently took up oil painting, inspired by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Bush, who was the 43rd president, signs his works '43.' 'I'm a beginner and I tell people that the signature on my paintings is worth more than the paintings,' Bush said.","The George W. Bush Presidential Center, .

A former Disneyland princess has revealed the tough demands placed on the real-life actors playing classic animated characters including Snow White, Alice In Wonderland and Tinkerbell. Known as ‘face characters,’ the princesses not only have to look the part, they need to remember quotes from their movies, stay in character at all times, and know how to sing and dance. A former Snow White actress, known only as Reddit user doublenn recently held an Ask Me Anything Q&A session in which she revealed how tough it can be working at Disneyland. Scroll down for video . In order to play a Disney princess an actor must have the right body type, the right age, and have the right temperament, reports Business Insider. According to doublenn, becoming a Disney princess requires a long and drawn out audition process. First the girls are checked to see which character they could potentially look like, then follow several other tests including dancing, acting in character and an interview. There are certain height restrictions involved as a Disney princess is typically between 5ft 4inches and 5ft 7inches, although for fairies such as Tinkerbell, Alice and Wendy must be more petite - between 4ft 11inches and 5ft 2inches. Age is another important factor. Most girls are between 18 and 23, some last until they are 27, but it is almost unheard off for a princess or fairy to be played by someone over 27. Disney face characters are required to stay in character at all times and always smile . Once chosen, the lucky actors go through an intensive five day training course during which they study Disney movies so they can quote lines said by their character. Each day requires a lot of preparation for the actor to become their character. Doublenn told Reddit that it would take her an hour to get read, including 20 minutes just putting on Snow White’s dress. Throughout the day she was then required to touch-up her makeup to ensure she always looked her best. Doublenn also revealed that being a face character isn’t a lucrative career and during her time as Snow White she started on $13.50 an hour which increased to $16. Actors playing Disney princesses go through a tough selection process and their careers are over before they become 27 . Disney also has lots of rules for its actors to follow, with the main one being that princesses need to remain in character at all time. Other rules include not being allowed to sit down while working, always smiling, always doing the character's voice. Doublenn revealed that as a result of straining her voice to sound more like Snow White over several years she developed inoperable vocal nodes. However she also says she enjoyed her time at Disney and made some long lasting friends with the other princesses.

After two days of endless sandbagging, Cottrell thought he could rest . Saturday night, but the constant beeping of heavy equipment outside and . flood worries kept him up. 'I had a rough night last night. I had an anxiety attack,' said Cottrell, who also owns a downtown antique store. Trish . Connelly, 57, was optimistic the town would beat back the river. Her . plan to open a new fine arts gallery downtown this weekend were on hold . “until we know what the river is going to do,” she said. Towns are bracing themselves as flood waters are expected to crest Sunday and could reach record heights . A boat sits in a flooded portion of a neighborhood in Chiilicothe, Ill. 'This is frustrating for people,' Connelly said. 'This isn’t as bad as 2008, but thank God it stopped raining.' Gov.

'The . water is continuing to rise but it is our full hope and expectation . that these walls will hold,' Nixon said of the sandbag levees. Clarksville has a flood protection system in which a temporary levee — . aluminum slats filled with sand — can be built if the river rises, but . the Mississippi was too quick this time.

Ariel Castro left a special needs student on his own on the school bus he ordering the teen to 'lie down bitch.' The details emerged as the 52-year-old prepares to appear in court today on kidnapping and rape charges. Castro worked as a Cleveland school bus driver for over 20 years until last fall when he was fired from his job. 'I enjoy working with children,' the accused Cleveland predator wrote on a job application before he was hired in February 1991. 'I plan to drive a bus, and working (sic) with young people.' The trouble began in Castro's job a year after he allegedly abducted his first victim Michelle Knight, 32, who was 20 years old when she vanished in 2002. In 2004 Castro abandoned a special-needs student on his bus so he could get fast food. He told the teen 'Lay down bitch' before going into Wendy's - Castro was suspended for 60 days as a result. He kept his head down for five years, until 2009 when he was suspended for another 60 days after making an illegal U-turn with a busload of kids on a busy Cleveland street.

Nasa has unveiled a breathtaking image that shows a year in the life of the sun - and a video that condenses three years of activity on the solar surface into three minutes. It reveals solar flares and coronal mass ejections . caught in the act in unprecedented detail. The images from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory also reveal space weather that can send radiation and solar . material toward Earth and interfere with satellites in space. Scroll down for video . A composite of 25 separate images spanning the period of April 16, 2012 to April 15, 2013, revealing the zones on the sun where active regions are most common during this part of the solar cycle . In the three years since it first provided images of the sun in the spring of 2010, NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has had virtually unbroken coverage of the sun's rise toward solar maximum, the peak of solar activity in its regular 11-year cycle. The image above and video below video shows those three years of the sun at a pace of two images per day. Each image is displayed for two frames at a 29.97 frame rate. The SDO’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) captures a shot of the sun every 12 seconds in 10 different wavelengths. The images shown here are based on a wavelength of 171 Angstroms, which is in the extreme ultraviolet range and shows solar material at around 600,000 Kelvin. In this wavelength it is easy to see the sun’s 25-day rotation as well as how solar activity has increased over three years. June 2, 2010 to April 15, 2013 at a cadence of two frames per day, or one frame every 12 hours. The images were captured at 171 Angstrom light, which highlights material around 600,000 Kelvin and shows features in the upper transition region and quiet corona of the sun. The still image shows a partial eclipse of the sun by the moon from SDO's perspective. During the course of the video, the sun subtly increases and decreases in apparent size. This is because the distance between the SDO spacecraft and the sun varies over time. The image is, however, remarkably consistent and stable despite the fact that SDO orbits the Earth at 6,876 miles per hour and the Earth orbits the sun at 67,062 miles per hour. 'Such stability is crucial for scientists, who use SDO to learn more about our closest star,' says Nasa, which operates the craft. 'These images have regularly caught solar flares and coronal mass ejections in the act, types of space weather that can send radiation and solar material toward Earth and interfere with satellites in space.' Researchers hope the images will improve our ability to predict this space weather.","Nasa timelapse shows images from its Solar Dynamics Observatory since it was launched in 2010 .

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 10:31 EST, 21 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:08 EST, 21 September 2012 . A woman who had twins with a long-time friend is locked in a complicated custody battle after he told her he was gay, had only used her as a surrogate and was keeping the children with his partner. Cindy Close, 48, met businessman Marvin McMurrey in Houston, Texas in 2005 and, as they were both in their 40s, not married and without families, they decided to have children together. 'I've always wanted to be a mom,' Close told Fox. 'That's my biggest dream and it always has been. He came across as a very kind man, a very good man, and I trusted him.' The pair, who had planned to co-parent the children, decided to use in-vitro fertilization with anonymous donor eggs for the pregnancy. McMurrey paid for the procedure, the lawsuit claims. Scroll down for video . Heartbreak: Cindy Close breaks down as she recounts how her long-time friend agreed to have a baby with her and then said she was a surrogate when they were born. He has temporary custody . When she found out earlier this year that, after two rounds of IVF, she was pregnant with twins, 'I was absolutely thrilled,' Close said. 'I always wanted twins.' But feelings of joy were quickly replaced with betrayal when she gave birth to a boy and a girl in July - and McMurrey told her he was taking the children. 'The social worker came to me and said we . had a surrogate situation,' she said. '[The worker] claimed I was a surrogate for him and his . domestic partner that I didn't even know he had.' He became so enraged when he saw Close breastfeeding the children in hospital, he took out a restraining order against her, she said. Betrayal: After the birth, Marvin McMurrey (left) told Close he was gay and the babies would be brought up by him and his partner, Phong Nguyen (right). The children are currently staying with Nguyen . Battle: Close said that even though she used donor eggs to get pregnant there was never a surrogate contract . Cindy Close's case is complicated as a doctor advised her to use donor eggs due to her age, so she is not the children's biological mother. Marvin McMarrey claims she was a surrogate, but typically, a contract must be agreed and the mother and father are spelled out if this is the case. However, attorneys said Texas law does not exclude other arrangements for surrogates, which is an issue the courts may take up here. In normal surrogate cases, the intended mother's eggs are used inside a different woman. Even though the intended mother does not carry the children, she is legally the 'mother' due to an agreement. In this case, an anonymous donor was used and the child would have no legal mother, as is required. An issue that could also work . against McMurrey, who wants to bring up the children with his gay partner, is that the intended parents have to be married for a . surrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by the state. Traditional surrogacy - where parents use a surrogate woman's eggs and body to carry a child - is not recognised in Texas. McMurrey filed a lawsuit against . Close in August, demanding he be named as the father as she was simply a . surrogate and had no rights. He has temporary custody of the children, and they are now living with McMurrey's partner, Phong Nguyen - even though the father does not live there. Close said she is only allowed to see . her children for two hours a day on Monday to Friday, and claims the . couple has placed cameras in the room to watch her as she holds her . babies. 'I only ever wanted to be a mom and... after giving me my dream, he's taking that away,' she said, breaking down in tears. The courts will now determine what rights Close has as she struggles to define in legal terms what it means to be a mother. 'We've alleged he duped Cindy into have . her children on the basis on him attempting to have her declared a . surrogate once they were born,' her attorney, Grady Reiff, said. He . explained that, in Texas, the mother does not need to prove she is the . parent but McMurrey must prove Close was a surrogate. They never signed a . contract or agreement, he said. 'This was not a surrogacy, so it never . occurred to me that I would ever need a written agreement,' Close told the Houston Chronicle. 'If anything, I thought he would lose . interest because I didn't expect him to be a very involved father.' Reiff . added: 'It's our position that a woman who gives . birth is the mother, unless there is a [surrogate] agreement.' If . McMurrey had his way, the children would have no legal 'mother'. Taking a stand: Attorney Grady Reiff said Cindy was duped and McMurrey must prove she was a surrogate . In surrogate cases, the intended . mother's eggs are used and, while she does not carry the child, she is . the 'mother' because of the agreement. In Texas, it's not the mother's burden to prove she is the parent, Reiff, said, so the onus is now on McMurrey to prove Close was a surrogate. Another issue that could work . against McMurrey is that the intended parents have to be married for a . surrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by the state. 'The father is arguing a very technical . legal position,' Jim Paulsen, a professor at South Texas College of Law, said. 'But it's one of those cases that you . hope the judge will be able to look at more than just preliminary . technical matters.' McMurrey's attorney, Ellen Yarrell, did not comment on the case. He and Close will appear in court on Monday. See below for video .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 16:36 EST, 2 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:39 EST, 2 May 2013 . An Oregon family who became . desperately ill after unknowingly buying a former meth lab last summer has finally settled with Freddie Mac, which sold them the property. Beth and Jonathan Hankins, who moved into the property with their infant son last year, are also working with lawmakers to require sellers to disclose if a home has been tested for contamination. The couple bought the home through HomeSteps, a listing service for Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing organization. Freddie Mac has now said it will review its selling policies. 'After speaking to the Hankins and hearing their concerns first hand we were able to work closely together and come to a mutually agreeable resolution,' the company said, ABC reported. Relief: Beth and Jonathan Hankins have finally settled with Freddie Mac, which last year sold them a foreclosed home which had previously been a meth lab, making them desperately ill . 'We will continue to review and update our policies to protect our buyers and their confidence in HomeSteps homes.' The settlement amount has not been disclosed. The couple has now moved 25 miles from the original property in Klamath Falls. The bought the first home for just $36,500 - but had no idea about its history. Within days of moving into the property with their infant son, Ezra, they began experiencing breathing problems and, after weeks, they were struck with agonizing mouth sores, nose bleeds and migraines. More than they bargained for: The Klamath Falls, Oregon house on Radcliffe was visibly in need of repair but methamphetamine toxins are invisible and they had no idea of the property's history . 'We mostly experienced extreme dry mouth and had mouth sores, making it extremely painful to even drink water,' Mr Hankins told ABC News at the time. They were about to call the doctor when a neighbour revealed . the truth about the home's previous tenants and just as . quickly as they had taken ill, their dream purchase became their . nightmare. They bought a $50 testing kit and found that the house on 2427 Radcliffe was . not only a meth lab but that its contamination level was nearly 80 . times higher than the Oregon Health Authority limit. The . couple promptly moved in with relatives before renting another property . nearby, and now lament that they are facing financial ruin. Mr and Mrs Hankins, the owner of a coffee house and an ER . nurse,  had bought the home from Freddie Mac for what . they considered a steal, even though they knew it needed work. Superficial: Before disaster struck, Jonathan Hankins and his two-year-old son Ezra painted the walls of their new home thinking they only had to make minor repairs and give the house a little love to resurrect it . Good as new? The Hankins spent about $5,000 on upgrading rooms like the bathroom before discovering the shocking news about their beloved home . Decline: Beth Hankins, an ER nurse, started experiencing breathing problems before her husband started suffering from migraines and nosebleeds and Ezra developed mouth sores . 'We said, ""It needs a little bit of love, but it's got good bones,""' Jonathan Hankins told Yahoo News. 'We just had no idea that those bones were poisonous - the walls were poisoning us.' After learning of its former use as a meth lab, they contacted Freddie Mac to find out why they had not been told. They learned the local . authorities had not contacted the Oregon Health Authority, as is . customary, as there had not been any recent drug-related enforcement . actions at the home, ABC reported. Freddie . Mac said it encourages buyers to check federal agency listings kept . about meth labs, but the Hankins said the organisation only encouraged . them to test how structurally secure the home was. The couple delivered a petition . to Freddie Mac's New York offices at the end of the year to ask the . organisation to require testing of homes for meth residue before they . are sold. Unaware: Within days of moving in, Beth started developing breathing problems and just weeks later, the couple's son Ezra, started getting mouth sores and was unable to drink water . Kicked out: A neighbour told them the home had been a meth lab and the couple moved out . Though in 23 states, including Oregon, . laws require sellers to disclose if a property was ever used as a . clandestine drug laboratory, Freddie Mac claims it had no idea of the . Klamath Falls house's history. Freddie . Mac spokesman Brad German told ABC: 'We certainly empathize with the . situation, but we had no prior information about the way the home had . been used. If we had, of course, we would have disclosed it.' Joe . Mazzuca of Meth Lab Cleanup admitted that even with disclosure laws, . only one in ten labs are busted and since the toxins are invisible 'you . don't always see the meth residue.' 'It's extremely dangerous stuff,' he said of methamphetamine. He also explained that information . regarding the history of a property routinely falls through the cracks . by the time the bank or government agency has reached the point of . foreclosure. Trouble: The local authority did not alert the Oregon Health Authority about the meth lab, like that pictured, before the house was sold as there had been no recent law enforcement action at the house . The Hankins delivered a petition to Freddie Mac headquarters demanding they take more responsibility . According . to Mr Mazzuca he receives calls from people in exactly the same . position as the Hankins every three to five minutes and recently heard . from a man in Michigan who unknowingly bought a contaminated home that . killed his 14-year-old daughter after two years. But . there is hope: Republican state representative Gail Whitsett has . introduced house bill 3499, which asks for foreclosed or auctioned homes . to be tested for methamphetamine  - or to let would-be owners know the . property has not yet been tested. 'A lot of people don't think about . it,' Whitsett told ABC. 'If you buy a home, it's not something that . comes to the forefront. You don't necessarily think about . methamphetamine.' She added that she hopes the meth . test will become as standard as the lead and mold tests in the state. She said around 800 homes scheduled for auction currently have no . information about their history.","Family suffered nose bleeds, breathing problems, migraines and mouth sores before they discovered the shocking truth from a neighbor .

Police in Japan have arrested a woman over the 1995 nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subway that killed 13 people, leaving only one cultist still wanted for one of the nation's worst ever mass-murders. Police said Naoko Kikuchi was being held on suspicion of murder after being arrested late Sunday in the city of Sagamihara, west of Tokyo, with local media reporting that officers swooped after a tip off. Kikuchi, 40, was one of only two remaining members of the Aum Supreme Truth doomsday cult still at large, and was wanted for being part of the team responsible for producing the sarin nerve gas used in the subway attack. Arrest: Naoko Kikuchi, a former member of Japan's Aum Supreme Truth doomsday cult responsible for the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway is driven away by police following her arrest in the city of Sagamihara west of Tokyo . 'It is true that I was involved in producing sarin gas, but I did not know what we were making at that time,' she was quoted as telling police. Kikuchi's arrest leaves only Katsuya Takahashi, 54, still on the wanted list. In the 17 years since the deadly attack, which injured thousands and caused havoc throughout Tokyo, Kikuchi had lived under an assumed identity, telling neighbours she worked as an accountant for a nursing care company, reports said. As she was: Naoko Kikuchi is seen in the police picture released 17 years ago . Kikuchi was quoted by Jiji news agency as telling police: 'I have lived as Chizuko Sakurai, but I'm relieved that I don't have to run away anymore.' The agency said she also told police she no longer believes in the teachings of Aum guru Shoko Asahara, adding: 'I will tell you everything. I am sorry for running away for a long time.' Police said she had been living with a 41-year-old man, who was not an Aum member and who stayed with her even after she revealed her true identity. Local media reported the proposed to Kikuchi soon after the pair met in around 2005. The woman told him that she had 'a reason she could not marry,' and revealed to him her true identity, Jiji reported, citing investigative sources. The man was also arrested early Monday accused of harbouring a criminal. The 1995 subway attack was one of Japan's worst mass-murders, in which sarin, first developed by the Nazis, was released onto several packed rush-hour trains. The coordinated attacks at stations near the centre of Japan's seat of government sowed panic throughout Tokyo's heaving metro system. The Aum cult was also responsible for an attack on the city of Matsumoto in . central Japan a year earlier, when sarin -- which Saddam Hussein deployed against the Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988 -- killed eight people. As well as those who died, thousands more were injured, some of them seriously and permanently by inhaling or coming into contact with the gas, which cripples the nervous system. Ramshackle: Journalists gather outside the house where Kikuchi was arrested in the city of Sagamihara near Tokyo. She had been on the run for more than 17 years . Investigation: A team of forensics officers arrive to inspect the building where Kikuchi was arrested . At large: A Tokyo wanted poster shows Katsuya Takahashi, now aged 54, the last cult member suspected in the subway attack still on the run . The end of Kikuchi's life on the run came just months after the surrender of Makoto Hirata, 47, a former Aum member who gave himself up at a police station in central Tokyo minutes before midnight on New Year's Eve. Aum guru Asahara, whose real name is Chizuo Matsumoto, preached a blend of Buddhist and Hindu dogma mixed with apocalyptic messages, and developed an obsession with sarin gas, becoming paranoid that his enemies would attack him with it. Nearly 200 members of the Aum Supreme Truth cult have been convicted in the gas attack and dozens of other crimes. Carnage: Injured commuters lie on the ground outside Tokyo's Tsukiji subway station following the gas attack on March 20, 1995 . Leaders: Guru Shoko Asahara (left) led the secretive sect Aum Supreme Truth cult and (right) senior cult member Tomomasa Nakagawa. Both men remain on death row convicted of numerous murders including the  sarin gas attacks . According to prosecutors the cult wanted to disrupt police moves to crack down on them and at the same time enact Asahara's vision of an apocalyptic war. Asahara was arrested at a commune near Mount Fuji two months after the attack on Tokyo and sentenced to hang, having been convicted of crimes resulting in multiple deaths. He remains on death row. The guru used a mix of charisma, mysticism and raw power to commit one of Japan's most shocking crimes with his disciples, who included doctors and engineers educated at elite Japanese institutions.","Naoko Kikuchi, 40, arrested on outskirts of Tokyo following tip-off .

A Nepalese woman has pulled off the extraordinary feat of climbing Mt Everest TWICE in a single season, reaching the summit just 11 days after her first ascent. Last night Chhurim Sherpa, 29 – known only as Chhurim – was being lauded as the heroine of Nepal after reaching the 29,035ft peak of the world’s highest mountain twice within the same month. She beamed with happiness when Nepal’s Tourism Minister, Mr Posta Bahadur Bogati handed over a certificate marking her astonishing victory over the mountain that has claimed hundreds of lives. Chhurim Sherpa has been awarded by Guinness World Records as she was the first woman to climb Mount Everest twice in one season . Chhurim Sherpa, from Kathmandu, has been described as a 'very brave woman' for climbing to the summit of Everest twice. Miss Chhurim reached the peak on May 12 last year before returning to base camp for a well-earned rest. But the call of the mountain overcame any desire to return to her home in the hills to the north east of the capital, Kathmandu – and she repacked her bag, checked over her equipment and set out for the peak again with a different climbing team just over a week later. 'She showed strong willpower and extraordinary zeal,’ said a Himalyan climbing group’s spokesman. ‘She is a very brave woman.’ Chhurim Sherpa shows off her award. She said the most difficult part of being a woman on the mountain was the lack of toilets . Mount Everest is the world's highest peak and is the ultimate challenge for professional and amateur climbers . The mountain has always been a formidable challenge for the women Sherpas of Nepal. The . first local female climber to reach the peak was 32-year-old Pasang . Lhamu, who accomplished the feat in 1993 but tragedy struck on the . descent when bad weather moved in and she succumbed to the cold. Since then 21 other Nepalese women have climbed to the top, but Miss Chhurim is the first to make two ascents in one season. The . greatest hardship for a woman climber like herself, Miss Chhurim said . in Kathmandu yesterday, was making the ascent with a team of male . sherpas. ‘It turns out to be very tough for women like me because there are no toilets,’ she said with a straight face. ‘Five of us had to share a tent – it was a bit awkward.’ Some 3,000 people have reached the top of Mt Everest since Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay conquered it in 1953. The 'summit season on Everest begins in late April when a small window between spring and the summer monsoon offers the best conditions for making the climb.

It is also called 'Chomolungma' by Tibetans and Sherpas, which means 'Mother Goddess of the Earth.' From the peak it is possible to see Tibet, India, and Nepal. Sir Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay were the first to reach the summit on May 29, 1953. There are two main routes to the top, one from Nepal and the other from Tibet. The southern route from Nepal is the most popular, and the simplest to do. There are also 16 other recognised routes.","Chhurim Sherpa, 29, is the first woman to reach the top twice in one season .

'We didn't believe it was him.' The group of students wondered aloud if they should walk downstairs and knock on Tsarnaev's dorm room door. 'What if he had a gun?' Bettencourt said. A school spokesman . declined to say whether at that point on Thursday Tsarnaev was still on . campus, about 60 miles south of Boston. Just as disturbing, said Bettencourt, was the casual way Tsarnaev chatted about the bombings during his gym workout. 'I don't know how . he talked about it. I don't know what was going on in his head,' Bettencourt said. 'I was driving here and thinking ""Wow, he actually did . it.""' The unnamed student who spoke to ABC . said that Tsarnaev, who was often referred to as Jahar, said blended . right back into normal college life and was 'convinced' that nothing . was off about him. 'I . thought as it was just regular old Jahar. We had a typical . conversation, he was not startled, he was not scared, he was not . anything. He was just the same old Jahar,' he said. Glasby said that Tsarnaev had even offered to give him a ride home to Waltham, Massachusetts, on Friday. Wounded: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, seen here moments after he was pulled from the boat where he was hiding, suffered a throat wound and a leg wound . But instead, Glasby spent Friday evacuating the campus, which is about an hour’s drive south of Boston.

Retired teacher Betty Yates, 77, who was found murdered in her cottage had been 'stabbed in the neck', an inquest revealed today. Mrs Yates' body was found at the foot of her stairs at the house down an isolated track in Bewdley, Worcestershire, after a friend who could not contact her called the police. Officers went to the cottage, which overlooks the River Severn, on January 4 where they discovered the widow's body. The inquest at Worcestershire Coroners Court heard that a post mortem examination determined Mrs Yates died from stab wounds to the neck. Coroner Geraint Williams released the body of Mrs Yates, who was born in Birmingham, back to her family for a funeral service. The court heard she is to be cremated. The inquest hearing has been adjourned until March 1 for further inquiries to be made and where the progress of the case will be reviewed. Mrs Yates is . believed to have been killed sometime between Monday, January 2, and Wednesday, January 4. Police are investigating whether Mrs Yates was stabbed after disturbing a burglar at her home. On . Saturday, a contributor to a memorial page on Facebook suggested she was . killed by an attacker who believed the cottage, called Riverscroft, was . empty. In a post full of . grammatical errors, someone calling herself Katie Eldridge wrote: ‘She . wasnt meant 2 b home, the lad panikd and stabd her cus she told them off . 4 bein in her house. It was meant 2 b a clean sweep but she was home, . she didn’t stand a chance.’ Picturesque: Mrs Yates' riverside home was at the end of a mile-long track. She lived there alone after her husband died . Police said they were investigating the posting, which was quickly removed. Neighbours described Mrs Yates as a ‘feisty’ woman who would ‘put up a good fight’. One local told how a friend had reported seeing a man wearing a red . hooded top running away from the house early last week. Another resident told the Daily Mail . he had seen a man walking through the Riverside Caravan Park near Mrs . Yates’s home on New Year’s Eve. Around . ten minutes later, he saw the stranger, who he said was aged around 40, . getting into a silver VW Golf GTI in Bewdley town centre. West Mercia Police said reports of the two men seen in the area would be investigated by detectives. In . a statement on Saturday, Mrs Yates’s children, Hazel, 53, and David, . 51, described their mother as ‘vivacious, independent’ and a ‘true . lady’.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 08:19 EST, 23 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:19 EST, 23 April 2013 . Noah Wall, pictured with his mother Shelly, was born with spina bifida and very little normal brain tissue . A baby has defied the odds to reach his first birthday despite being given such a low chance of survival that his parents bought a coffin for him before he was born. While still in the womb, Noah Wall was diagnosed with a catalogue of problems including spina bifida, rare chromosomal abnormalities and fluid on the brain. His parents, Shelly and Rob, were advised to have him terminated but they refused, determined to give their son the chance of life. Noah was born paralysed from the chest down and with a tiny amount of normal brain tissue – most of his skull was filled with cerebrospinal fluid. However, he has stunned doctors by reaching his first birthday and has even learned to move his arms, smile, wave and say ‘mama’ and ‘dada’. Mrs Wall, 41, from Abbeytown, Cumbria, said: ‘He is an absolute gift and we are very lucky that he is here.’ Noah was diagnosed with spinal bifida, a condition which affects the development of the spinal cord, when his mother went for her 12-week scan. Doctors also told the couple that the condition had left a massive hole in Noah’s back which they said they would be unable to stitch up. The couple were offered a termination but they stood firm, adamant that their son deserved the chance to live. However, they realised that the odds of survival were extremely low so they began organising the unborn baby’s funeral. Mrs Wall said: ‘Before he was born we received a letter saying he would not be resuscitated if he couldn’t breathe on his own because his condition was so serious. ‘To be pregnant and have to go to a funeral parlour to pick a coffin for your unborn baby is absolutely horrible. ‘My sister made a Christening outfit for him and we had a birthday cake because we thought it could be the only birthday he would ever have. Noah is also paralysed from the chest down and has chromosomal abnormalities . His parents were advised to have the pregnancy terminated as Noah's chance of survival was so low . ‘I was always positive right the way through but we obviously needed a back-up plan. ‘But keeping strong and positive as a family was important. It was a frightening situation to be in, really scary, but we never gave up on Noah.’ Astonishingly, when Noah was born on March 6 last year, he took his first breath and began crying. As a result, doctors changed their minds and carried out a five-hour operation to stitch up the hole in his back. He was allowed home after ten days but had to return to hospital for two months when doctors discovered an infection in the fluid in his head. Noah's brain scan shows how little normal brain he has - the grey area near his forehead is the only normal brain tissue, the black area is fluid . Mrs Wall said: ‘The first thing we heard when he was born was him taking a breath and then crying, which was unbelievable. ‘We had been told that he wouldn’t be going down to the baby care unit because they were adamant that he wouldn’t take a breath and said it would be cruel to keep a baby alive on oxygen. ‘It is amazing the things that he can do with such a small amount of brain - he folds his arms, can open his eyes, wave to you, say ‘mama’ and ‘dada’ and tell you when he is hungry.’ Noah requires constant supervision, has to be massaged five times a day and requires regular sessions of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy. His skull is fitted with a shunt which is used to drain the cerebrospinal fluid from his head. Mr Wall, 47, Mrs Wall and Noah’s sisters Steph, 21, and Ally, 16, are forced to live day to day knowing that every day could be the last they spend with him. His parents were told that he would not be resuscitated if he was unable to breathe on his own . But they remain positive and are making plans to prepare his legs for the possibility of him being able to stand. Mrs Wall said: ‘We don’t know how long he will live but we won’t put a time on him. We just enjoy every day and do as much as we can with him. ‘We spend a lot of quality time with him and he gets a lot of attention. We don’t know what he will be capable of but he is going in the right direction.’ Mrs Wall now raises money for Noah, and awareness about spina bifida by running a shop which sells products such as clothes, bags and teddy bears. Noah is now celebrating his first birthday but his family do not know how long he will live . She said: ‘By telling our story we want to inspire others who are pregnant with disabled babies not to give up hope. ‘We also want to make sure mothers take folic acid and vitamin B12 before their pregnancy as well as during as a lack of these vitamins can cause spina bifida. ‘There are 900 pregnancies with spinal defects every year and only 200 babies are actually born. ‘I wish someone had told me about the importance of taking folic acid before pregnancy. I had taken it, but not early enough.’","Noah Wall has spina bifida and is paralysed from the chest down .

But at 5ft 9in tall and weighing 13½ stone, that was how her friends and family referred to her — until now. Dawn, 47, lives in London with her husband, Dougie, 48, and their 23-year-old  daughter, Kirsty. She bought the 2-Day Diet book in  February when it was  serialised in the Daily Mail and has stuck to it ever since. 'In the first week I lost 7lb,' she says. 'The change was so dramatic that it was almost frightening.' Slimline: Dawn is losing an astonishing 7lbs a week on the 2-day diet which advocates fasting twice a week . The 2-Day Summer Diet: All new recipes in your Mail . She has shed more than 21lb so far and is determined not to stop until she reaches her 11-stone goal. 'In fact, even when I get there I’m not going to stop,' she says. 'This has changed my life and this is how I eat now.' Her impetus to lose weight came when Dawn was  diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. She had a mastectomy and was told by her GP that if she lost a bit of weight she could reduce the chance of the cancer returning. 'I tried WeightWatchers and Slimming World, but it never worked,' she says. Dawn works as a printer and the long hours and 6am starts meant she kept up her energy levels with chocolate, crisps and endless rounds of  supermarket sandwiches. The 2-day diet meant changing her eating habits completely: 'Now I count out 15 squares of chocolate each week and wrap five squares in clingfilm in three portions — that’s my three treats for non-diet days if I want them. 'I cook brown pasta and smother it in chilli tomato sauce (I’ve never used so much chilli and garlic in my life!) and roast a load of vegetables and throw them into a frittata,' she says. 'I love not being ""the big girl"" any more, but the most incredible thing is  how healthy I feel. I sleep brilliantly without waking up hungry, I’ve lost the hormonal mood swings and I feel so happy. 'This is by far the easiest diet I’ve ever done. It has changed my life. I just wish I’d known about it years ago.' Picky: With the 2-Day Diet you don't have to make difficult choices and allow yourself the odd treat . As spring finally breaks, it’s time to consign those boots, coats and jumpers to the attic and start thinking about a summer wardrobe — and a summer body. And if you’re keen to shed a few pounds, there’s no better way than the Daily Mail’s 2-Day Summer Diet. When we unveiled the 2-Day Diet earlier this year, thousands joined the revolution, losing weight and becoming healthier. Now, whether you’re already on the plan and want to give it a boost with fabulous new meal options, or you’re starting from scratch, the 2-Day Summer Diet is the perfect way to slim for summer parties and the beach. We began the new stage of the diet in Saturday’s Mail with a fabulous 32-page booklet packed with exciting recipes to tempt you. In today’s paper, we have even more dishes to keep you on the straight and narrow. The beauty is that you have to diet for only two consecutive days a week. Just 48 hours of low-carb, low-calorie meals in every seven days will help retrain your appetite for good. During the other five days you can enjoy delicious Mediterranean-style meals. The 2-Day Summer Diet is the brainchild of award-winning dietitian Dr Michelle Harvie, who specialises in food and exercise plans to prevent breast cancer, and renowned oncologist Professor Tony Howell, research director of the University of South Manchester’s Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention Centre. Their diet is unique because it has been clinically tested and proven to be more effective at shifting fat and easier to stick to than daily calorie-counting. It also leads to dramatic health improvements. Dr Harvie and Prof Howell’s studies showed a reduction in cancer risk for those who tried the 2-Day Diet. They also found it triggered a more dramatic drop in the hormone insulin than a conventional all-week-long diet. Though insulin is vital for regulating sugar levels in the body, an excess is believed to be the root of many weight-related health problems — not just Type 2 diabetes, but also heart disease, some cancers (particularly breast cancer) and possibly dementia. The 2-Day Diet has also been specifically designed to stop you feeling hungry and so you do not have to count calories. You just avoid certain foods and stick within portion limits on others. Diet days are low in carbohydrates (bread, pasta, potatoes), which can make you feel hungry. A low-carb diet also boosts fat-burning: when carbohydrates are kept to a minimum, your body quickly shifts from storing fat to burning it. On non-diet days, Dr Harvie and Professor Howell suggest you opt for healthy Mediterranean-style meals, which should include plenty of fresh produce, including  fruit and vegetables, healthy fats and dairy products. Their blueprint should re-educate you to eat in the healthiest way possible, boosting the benefits of diet days and establishing eating habits that should keep you trim — for ever.

"By . Graham Smith . UPDATED: . 05:35 EST, 12 January 2012 . A diary documenting the rapes and sexual assaults of underage girls and women was found alongside posed photographs of two murder victims in the home of a suspected serial killer, a court has heard. Joseph Naso, 78, owned journals that contained dozens of sexual and violent images of women. They were discovered in the former photographer's home in Reno, Nevada, by a probation officer in April 2010, a preliminary hearing in San Rafael, California, was told yesterday. Representing himself: Joseph Naso, 78, owned journals that contained mages of dead women, a preliminary hearing in San Rafael, California, was told yesterday . Naso, who is acting as his own lawyer in what is likely to be a death penalty case, has pleaded not guilty to the murders of four prostitutes in the 1970s and 1990s. He is alleged to be the infamous alphabet killer - also known as the double initial killer - and is said to have kept a numbered list of ten women. These included the prostitutes he is charged with killing - Roxene Roggasch in 1977; Carmen Colon in 1978; Pamela Parsons in 1993; and Tracy Tafoya in 1994. All four had matching initials and were found in northern California. One journal entry is said to have read: 'Girl in north Buffalo woods. She was real pretty. Had to knock her out first. Detective Richard Brown, of the Nevada Department of Public Safety and lead investigator on the case, said the journal was filled with such descriptions, and that Naso used the word rape in other sections. White-haired and wearing leg shackles, Naso sat alone at the courtroom defence table with his head rested on his hand. He listened as Marin County prosecutor Dori Ahana and Detective Brown detailed dozens of sexual and violent photographs of women seized from his home, objecting at times to their relevance. Naso's home in Reno, Nevada, where police say they found a diary documenting the rapes and sexual assaults of underage girls and women alongside posed photographs of two murder victims . The photographs showed many women . unconscious or appearing dead, including two prostitutes Naso is charged . with killing, Pamela Parsons and Tracy Tafoya. 'Who is paying for all of this entertainment?' Naso asked after hours of detailed testimony about the photos. 'This . is my private work, my photography. The women have been violated. What . happens in a home is sacred and private. The whole thing is disgusting, . and I don't see the relevance at all.' The first victim was Roxene Roggasch, whose body was found in Fairfax in Marin County in 1977. Police are investigating whether Carmen Colon (pictured) was killed by Naso in Rochester, New York, in the early 1970s. He is accused of killing another Carmen Colon in 1978 . According to news archives, investigators interviewed a prostitute at the time who claimed her pimp kidnapped, tortured and killed the 18-year-old Roggasch. No one was ever arrested. The second victim was Carmen Colon, whose body was found near Port Costa in Contra Costa County a year later. Pamela Parsons and Tracy Tafoya were separately found dead in Yuba County in 1993 and 1994 respectively. Tafoya was 31 when she was killed, according to death records. Parsons was a 38-year-old waitress whose body was found on a Marysville road, according to news archives. Police are also investigating possible links to the notorious 'double initial murder' in Rochester, New York, in the 1970s. Wanda Walkowicz, Michell Maenza and another Carmen Colon (pictured above) were all killed between 1971 and 1973. The girls - aged 10 and 11 - were all abducted, raped and strangled. Judge Andrew Sweet overruled Naso's objection. In one photograph of Parsons, Brown said she appeared to be dead. Describing the image, he said: 'I thought she was deceased. Her face doesn't appear natural.' Other photographs taken of the lower halves of women appeared to show the reddish-purple discolouration of the skin seen in dead people, Detective Brown said. In a bedroom in Naso's home, investigators also found a 'List Of Ten' that contained scrawled descriptions of ten women, including four references that prosecutors believe described the murder victims he is charged with killing. The matching letters of each woman's first and last names gave rise to the 'Double Initial' moniker for the case. Six other women referred to on the list have not yet been identified, but prosecutors say the investigation is ongoing. Authorities seized thousands of documents, calendars, ledgers, journals and photographs from Naso's house. In two safety deposit boxes, Naso kept $152,400 in cash, along with news clippings covering the murders of Parsons and Tafoya, and other personal items from women, the court heard. Nevada probation Officer Wesley Jackson testified that he arrived in April 2010 to check Naso's Nevada home for violations of his probation agreement and found food rotting on the kitchen counter and debris strewn about. All the bedrooms were locked, and Mr Jackson said Naso resisted opening them for a time. In Naso's bedroom, Mr Jackson said, he found mannequin parts and a full mannequin clad in a red dress. Women's lingerie was in the dresser drawers. In his garage, suitcases were found packed with mannequin legs clad in hosiery. Further searches of the home turned up a box of knives and guns hidden behind a refrigerator in Naso's garage, authorities said. Naso was forbidden to have weapons due to probation from a felony larceny conviction in California. Parsons' strangled body was found in the Yuba City area of northern California in 1993, where Naso was living at the time with his mentally ill son. Court documents state that Naso had photographed Parsons. A 1993 calendar Naso kept had an entry for September 15, Detective Brown said, that placed him in the area. 'Stayed in (Yuba City) all day long. Took care of some old business,' Detective Brown read from the calendar. 'September 15 was the last time Parsons was known to be alive,' he added. Tafoya was killed in the area when Naso lived in Yuba City. Her body was found on the side of Highway 70 near Marysville Cemetery in 1994. In a calendar entry dated August 6, 1994, Naso referred to meeting with a woman in Marysville near the time of Tafoya's death. 'Picked up a nice broad in (Marysville). 4pm. She came over for four hours. Took photographs. Nice legs. She ripped me off,' Detective Brown read, adding: 'That's the last date Tracy Tafoya was known to be alive.' Investigators have said Naso might have used his then-wife's panty hose to strangle Roggasch, a prostitute whose 1977 murder went unsolved for decades. Colon's decomposed body was found near Port Costa 1978 by a California Highway Patrol officer in Contra Costa County. Authorities have said DNA evidence collected from her fingernails could tie Naso to her slaying. Officials have previously said Naso was being investigated for possible links to New York's 'Double Initial Murders' of three girls in the early 1970s.However, no charges have been filed. Due to his work as a photographer, Naso travelled between New York and California extensively for decades. At the end of the preliminary hearing, the judge will determine if prosecutors have enough evidence to take Naso to trial.
