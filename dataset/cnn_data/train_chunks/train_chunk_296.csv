"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Celebratory gunfire erupted across the capital Sunday when Iraq's soccer team won the Asian Cup, in a 1-0 shutout against three-time champions Saudi Arabia. A soldier takes position Sunday in central Baghdad after a vehicle ban was announced in the Iraqi capital. Stray bullets killed four people and wounded 17 others in the capital, an official with the Iraqi interior Ministry told CNN. An Iraqi woman who was among military workers watching the game from a U.S.-Iraqi military base labeled the team members ""heroes."" ""This is our victory,"" said the woman, who was interviewed by CNN but would not allow her face to appear on camera because of security concerns. U.S. soldiers at the base joked that, with the victory, the war was over and they could return home, CNN's Arwa Damon reported. Iraqi state television showed the players, draped in Iraqi flags, hoisting pewter cups aloft as they reached out for the main trophy held by a player on a dais that had been set up in the field.  Watch Iraqis celebrate in Baghdad Â» . Confetti filled the air and fireworks lit up the night sky after the game, which was played in Jakarta. The Iraqi team's players ran a victory lap around the field before posing for photographs. Each of the 23 members of the Iraqi team is to receive $10,000, a prize promised them by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki before the final match, whatever its outcome, Iraq's Youth and Sports Minister Jasim Mohammed Jaafar said. The team is scheduled to return Wednesday to Baghdad, where they will be greeted by government officials and awarded a special gift from the prime minister, Jaafar said. During the past week, as the Iraqis ascended to the finals, dozens of people died in soccer-related violence, some from celebratory gunfire and some from attacks. In an effort to prevent further violence, authorities on Sunday clamped down on security in Baghdad. Vehicles were banned from the streets of the capital as part of a curfew that began at 4 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) and was scheduled to end at 6 a.m. Monday (10 p.m. Sunday ET). In the Jordanian capital of Amman, Iraqi exiles drove through the streets, waving Iraqi flags and honking their horns, CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reported. In a western Amman neighborhood, hundreds of Iraqi women, children and men danced in the street in celebration. A smiling young man in a wheelchair maneuvered himself through the crowds while an old woman who could barely walk held a small Iraqi flag aloft. ""Baghdad is victorious!"" some chanted, while others chanted ""Down with terror!"" One woman said the team's victory represents a sign of unity among Iraqis. ""We are Shiite, Sunni, Kurd and Christian, we are all united,"" she said. Wiping away tears of joy, she said it was the first time in years living outside of Iraq that she felt she was at home. About an hour into the spontaneous celebration, the mood in Amman was dampened as Jordanian security forces used force to disperse the Iraqis. As onlookers booed, the forces shoved a middle-aged Iraqi man into the back of a police SUV. Nearby, a Jordanian policeman could be seen kicking a young celebrant. A Jordanian government spokesman referred CNN to police for comment on the matter. Police said the crowds were being dispersed for security reasons.

"(CNN) -- Having conquered the desktops, music libraries and phones of millions, Apple reportedly wants to adorn one more spot in the life of the gadget-obsessed -- their wrists. The company is developing a smart watch that would run on the same iOS operating system that powers iPhones, iPads and some iPods, according to a report in The New York Times. The watches would include a curved glass screen, according to the Times report, citing ""people familiar with the company's explorations."" Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Last year, Corning, which makes the Gorilla Glass used for iPads and iPhones, unveiled a thinner, more touch-sensitive version of their product that could make it easier to produce a watch with curves. And, yes, assuming it includes chat-feature Facetime, Dick Tracy fans could actually live out those decades-old dreams of having a video-enabled Two-Way Wrist Radio. What other features might such a watch have? Observers have speculated about monitoring of the wearer's vital signs or turn-by-turn directions, spoken by Siri, Apple's ""voice assistant."" Of course, such reports are no sure thing. Over the years, Apple has reportedly poked around into products ranging from cars to cameras without any commercially available product ever coming from it. An Apple TV has been in the rumor stages for years now, and while many observers still expect one to surface eventually, there have been no signs yet. If the plans are indeed sincere, Apple may be taking a cue from the interest the market already has shown in such a product. Pebble, a watch that uses Bluetooth technology to link up with the user's smartphone, racked up a record $10.2 million on Kickstarter last year. TikTok and LunaTik, two styles of a wrist-strap gadget that turns an iPod Nano into a smart watch, raked in another $942,000. At least one analyst told the Times that the move makes sense, although it might be a while before an ""iWatch"" hits the shelves. ""Over the long term, wearable computing is inevitable for Apple; devices are diversifying, and the human body is a rich canvas for the computer,"" said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester Research analyst who specializes in mobile technology. ""But I'm not sure how close we are to a new piece of Apple hardware that is worn on the body.""","The ""iWatch"" would have a curved screen and run on iOS, report says .

"Hartford, Connecticut (CNN) -- If you have a TV you have heard, or heard of, vuvuzelas. They're the cheap plastic horns played by tens of thousands of spectators in World Cup soccer stadiums in South Africa and buzzing like so many unswattable mosquitoes in the ear of an irate camper. To hear most viewers tell it, ""vuvuzela"" -- like ""abattoir"" -- is a beautiful word for an ugly thing. The horns drone for the entire 90 minutes of every game, and that is the perfect word for what they do: drone, like the male bee that does no work -- idling pointlessly, unproductively, infuriatingly, to no end. Or so say the multitudes that now watch the games with the sound muted. I've tried muting the TV. The vuvuzelas still ring in my ear long after the sound is turned off and even after the game has ended. The world of sports has given us swimmer's ear, tennis elbow and athlete's foot. Here, at last, is an affliction named for the spectator at home: couch potato's tinnitus, turning every World Cup fan into a Metallica roadie. There is no clear etymology for the word vuvuzela, but my guess is it derives from the Latin ""vuvu"" (blood) and ""zela"" (issuing from both ears). The buzz it has created for the World Cup is not the kind FIFA intended. TV viewers and newspaper writers this week have demanded that vuvuzelas be banished from South African stadiums for the monthlong tournament. They argue that the horns drown out singing and chanting, the traditional soundtrack for soccer. To read the editorials, you'd think that the Vienna Boys Choir has been serenading Manchester United and Liverpool when they play each other in the English Premier League. I've been to plenty of English, European and World Cup matches. Many of the songs and chants now being drowned out by the vuvuzelas are in far worse taste than the plastic horns. Trust me. They make the vuvuzela sound like Louis Armstrong playing Gabriel's trumpet on a cloud in heaven. Perhaps it's the Stockholm Syndrome, but I've grown to like the vuvuzela, for any number of reasons. With the 2010 World Cup, the vuvuzela joins the ticking stopwatch on ""60 Minutes"" and the piercing signal of the Emergency Broadcast System in the pantheon of nonmusical sounds that instantly tell you what is on TV even before you've entered the room. It denies us tranquility, sure, but the vuvuzela is a little bit like tranquility: a beautiful word for a beautiful thing. Long after the World Cup final is played on July 11, the sound of the vuvuzela will remain instantly evocative of South Africa -- as the didjeridoo is to Australia, the bagpipe is to Scotland or the car horn is to New York City. And even if I didn't like the vuvuzela, I would keep my objections to myself. It isn't polite to tell another country how to watch a soccer match. The sound that issues from the vuvuzela is cacophonous -- joyful and infuriating at the same time. It calls to mind mosquitoes on a continent tragically ravaged by those malaria-bearing insects. For better and worse, the vuvuzela is the sound of South Africa. As Charlie ""Bird"" Parker said: ""If you don't live it, it won't come out your horn."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Rushin.","Steve Rushin says buzzing at World Cup is vuvuzelas, horns played by South African fans .
They drive people crazy, he says; even muting TV won't take the sound out of your ears .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Palestinian President Mahoud Abbas put forth a historic U.N. membership bid for an independent state of Palestine on Friday; a move Israel says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns. The formal application -- viewed as a largely symbolic gesture because an American veto is all but assured should the request come to a vote in the Security Council -- drew applause in the assembly when the Palestinian leader raised the document at the podium during his speech at the 66th annual session of the General Assembly. The time has come for a ""Palestinian Spring"" to join the Arab Spring in reshaping the Middle East, he said. ""My people desire to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humanity."" But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, later taking his turn to address the General Assembly, said Palestinians are looking for a ""state without peace,"" ignoring security concerns important to Israel. He said Palestinians are not armed only with their ""hopes and dreams,"" as Abbas said in his speech. To that he added ""10,000 missiles, and Grad rockets supplied by Iran, not to mention the river of lethal weapons flowing into Gaza."" ""Palestinians should first make peace with Israel, and then get their state,"" he declared, adding that peace must arrive through a two-state solution that recognizes Israel as a Jewish state. If that occurs, Israel ""will be the first"" to recognize Palestinian statehood, the prime minister said. Representatives from the United Nations, the United States, Russia and the European Union -- a group commonly referred to as the Quartet for the Middle East -- discussed the request later Friday, and issued a statement saying the bid is now before the U.N. Security Council. The group called for a ""preparatory meeting,"" to take place within one month and intended to outline how peace negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders might take place. Each side would then be tasked with producing a comprehensive proposal on territory and security issues within three months, and ""to have made substantial progress with six months,"" the statement said. The timetable for an agreement is not to exceed the end of 2012, countering any anticipation of immediate change in the region. The Security Council is expected to meet Monday to further discuss the issue. Abbas' speech, meanwhile, provoked cheers and chants from flag-waving Palestinians who watched the address on a big-screen television in a square in Ramallah, the West Bank. Moments after handing over the formal letter seeking full United Nations membership, Abbas said Israel continues to stymie peace and flout international law, and he called on United Nations to act urgently. ""We aspire for and seek a greater and more effective role for the United Nations in working to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in our region that ensures the inalienable, legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people,"" said the Palestinian leader. His speech was closely watched across the Middle East. The hundreds who gathered in Ramallah greeted the news that he had formally filed the request with cheers, song and dance. Demonstrations took place Friday in New York and in cities across the Middle East as demonstrators waved Palestinian flags and chanted slogans in a show of solidarity. U.S. Embassies across the region warned citizens to avoid the expected demonstrations, saying they could turn violent with little warning. An increased police presence was visible in Jerusalem, where the military had stockpiled riot-control gear against the possibility of greater violence. Ahead of the speech, Palestinian youths lobbed rocks and bottles at Israeli security forces at a West Bank security checkpoint leading to Jerusalem, a fairly routine Friday occurrence. There were no injuries, but rock-throwing between Israeli citizens and Palestinians in Qusra led to three injuries, one of them fatal, according to the Israel Defense Forces. No immediate action is expected on Abbas' request that Palestine become a member state of the international body, and such a U.N. declaration is almost certainly doomed to failure because of the United States' veto power in the Security Council. ""Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N.,"" President Barack Obama said in a speech to delegates at the General Assembly earlier this week. ""If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now."" Obama and Abbas met Wednesday as part of behind-the-scenes wrangling that has accompanied the controversial request. The American president said he supports Palestinian statehood, but reiterated a long-standing U.S. position that Israel must be part of the discussions. Israel has described the bid as counterproductive, and has called for an immediate resumption of talks to begin in New York and to be continued in Ramallah and Jerusalem. Negotiations broke down last year. And while a U.S. veto would block the bid for full U.N. membership, the General Assembly could still vote to upgrade the status of Palestinians, who currently hold the status of non-voting observer ""entity."" The body could change that status to permanent observer ""state,"" identical to the Vatican's standing at the United Nations. Despite a breathtaking year of change that has seen popular revolutions mark political upheaval in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and other nations, talk of Palestinian statehood dominated the General Assembly's session this week. ""The membership effort sends a strong message by Abbas to Palestinians that he is working to advance the Palestinians' cause,"" said Steven Cook, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations . ""Right now, he's thinking about his domestic political situation in order to maintain his position,"" Cook said. ""So he's not eaten alive."" Hamas, the dominant of two Palestinian political groups, has maintained that neither a U.N. application nor direct negotiations with Israel would provide the Palestinian people ""with what they're looking for."" ""Abbas' emotional speech succeeded in moving people's feelings but his description of Palestinian suffering is different from reality,"" said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri. Hamas controls Gaza while Abbas' Fatah organization holds the West Bank. CNN's Kevin Flower and Fionnuala Sweeney contributed to this report.","It is time for a ""Palestinian Spring,"" President Abbas tells the United Nations .

"(CNN) -- Dealing with deep drug war wounds is a top issue on Mexico's presidential campaign trail, but the election results could have an impact on both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border. As candidates across party lines suggest new strategies, like reducing violence and taking troops off the streets, some U.S. lawmakers say they're nervous that cross-border cooperation could wane after Mexican voters pick a new president July 1. Last week, a Republican congressman told the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration that he was concerned about Mexico's ""impending change in power."" And Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in February that he feared at least one Mexican presidential candidate was not committed to continuing his country's campaign against organized crime. Worries in Washington as Mexico's election looms are a reminder of the close ties binding the neighboring nations. The two countries share billions of dollars in trade and a border that stretches for nearly 2,000 miles. Millions of U.S. citizens travel to Mexico every year, and millions of Mexican immigrants -- legal and illegal -- live in the United States. ""Almost no other country affects the United States as much on a day to day basis as Mexico,"" said Shannon O'Neil, a Latin American studies fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""What happens in Mexico is hugely important for the United States."" For nearly six years, a brutal drug war in Mexico with a staggering death toll of more than 47,500 people has dominated discussions between the two countries. Photos: Violence in Juarez . Announcing a crackdown on cartels and sending troops into the streets to help fight the battle were among the first major moves by President Felipe Calderon after he took office in December 2006. The United States voiced its support and offered $1.6 billion to aid in the fight. U.S. officials have praised growing cooperation with the Mexican government as a key weapon in the war on drugs. But on the campaign trail in Mexico this year, the three leading candidates have stressed the need to shift strategies. Is Mexico's drug war strategy working? Leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the opposition Democratic Revolution Party has summed up his security policy as ""abrazos, no balazos"" (hugs, not bullets). He started his campaign with a pledge to pull back troops from Mexico's streets, but he said last month that the military would remain deployed until there is a ""trained, skilled and moralized"" police force. Josefina Vazquez Mota of the ruling National Action Party has apparently tried to distance herself from Calderon's policies with a simple slogan: ""Josefina Diferente"" (Different Josefina). ""The results will be measured not just by criminals captured, but by how stable and secure communities are,"" her campaign website says. The Mexico drug war: Bodies for billions . Enrique Pena Nieto of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has pledged to focus more on reducing violence and less on catching cartel leaders and blocking drugs from reaching the United States. He told CNNMexico that federal, state and local authorities would coordinate a better security plan on his watch. ""I propose adjusting the strategy and making a national front that involves the three levels of the government, focused on diminishing the violence in the country,"" he said. Some political opponents of Pena Nieto, whose party governed Mexico for more than 70 years until 2000, have warned that negotiating with drug cartels and gangs could be on his agenda -- an accusation that Pena Nieto has repeatedly denied. Fareed Zakaria: Mexico on the rise . But his denials haven't squelched speculation on both sides of the border that negotiating with cartels -- or at least easing the pressure on them -- could be on the table. In a congressional hearing last week, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner said the war on drugs was nearing a ""potential crossroad,"" referring to Pena Nieto's plan and his party's political history. ""While in power, the PRI minimized violence by turning a blind eye to the cartels,"" the Wisconsin Republican said, noting that Pena Nieto ""does not emphasize stopping drug shipments or capturing kingpins."" Minutes earlier, DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart had testified that Mexico had extradited more than 200 accused suspects to the United States since 2010. ""Without reservation, I would characterize the cooperation between United States and Mexico at an all-time high,"" she said. Sensenbrenner said the close teamwork could be short-lived. ""I worry that the relationship could be at a high water mark with the impending change in power,"" he said. In a statement the next day, Pena Nieto's campaign said he was committed to combatting organized crime. ""The law is applied, it is never negotiated,"" the statement said. No matter who wins, the election will likely mark ""a change from where U.S.-Mexico security strategy has been,"" said O'Neil of the Council on Foreign Relations. But the shift is something U.S. officials who work with Mexico have prepared for, she said. Robert Pastor, director of the Center for North American Studies at American University in Washington, said a change in presidential leadership will give Mexican officials a chance to consider fresh approaches to deal with drug-related violence and other issues that affect the United States, such as economic and energy policies. ""Between the three candidates and the predecessors, there would be an opportunity to reflect on what worked, and what didn't work, and how, perhaps things should be changed,"" he said. The concerns from some U.S. lawmakers about a shift in drug war strategy are overblown, he said. ""All three of the major candidates have committed themselves to fighting drug trafficking and reducing the violence,"" Pastor said. ""All three are very much committed to working with the United States."" That itself is a notable shift from past elections, when cross-border relations soured or sweetened based on who won the presidential vote, according to Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""The U.S.-Mexico relationship has now matured to a point where changes in party and personality matter less than they used to,"" he said. ""This is a country that matters enormously for the U.S., and for the first time, perhaps, what happens in the elections won't change [that relationship] much."" Mexico's candidates vow a different kind of drug war . CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","Deadly drug war among top issues as Mexican presidential hopefuls suggest new strategies .

"(CNN) -- Protesters carried a Mexican flag stained with fake blood in the country's capital this week -- a symbol, they said, of President Felipe Calderon's six-year term. Just a few hours later, Mexican television broadcast video of the outgoing president brushing his hand across a pristine flag as triumphant music played in the background. The images showed two drastically different interpretations of Calderon's legacy: a fed-up public that has grown weary of a brutal drug war; and a president who maintains that his fight against organized crime was necessary and, by some measures, successful. ""I leave having accomplished my duty and responsibility to serve Mexico,"" said Calderon, whose term ends this week. ""I have worked to leave a stronger, healthier country, with a better justice system and a solid economy."" But activists offered a much harsher assessment, staging a protest in Mexico City dubbed ""A Recounting of the Damage: A Six-Year Term of Death."" ""Felipe Calderon leaves as a traitor to the country, as the president of devastation and contempt,"" the Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity said in a statement, slamming Calderon's ""clumsy attempt to reduce crime."" Mexico's new leader to CNN: The key weapon in drug war . Calderon: We had to make 'difficult decisions' In his farewell address, broadcast Wednesday night, the president thanked the country's public officials, military and police for ""defending Mexican families."" Calderon noted that his government had passed universal health care and kept Mexico's economy stable in the face of the global financial crisis. But he did not explicitly mention the controversial six-year crackdown on drug cartels that began in 2006, when he deployed federal troops to fight organized crime. The battle became a hallmark of his tenure, and has sparked mounting criticism in recent years. Government statistics estimate that 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence since Calderon took office. More: How the drug war started . The Mexican government has not released official figures since January, and others estimate a much higher death toll. Officials have repeatedly said that brutal battles between rival cartels fueled the violence. And in earlier speeches, Calderon has noted that 25 of the country's 37 most-wanted drug traffickers were killed or captured during his tenure. ""Thanks to all Mexicans for your understanding before the very difficult decisions that we had to make in order to face so many complicated challenges,"" Calderon said in his address. ""Beyond my capabilities and limitations, I assure you that I have put all my willingness and understanding to work toward the common good of Mexicans."" A recent national survey by the Mexican firm Gabinete de Comunicacion Estrategica (Strategic Communications Office) revealed that nearly 66% of Mexicans questioned believe that drug traffickers were winning the organized crime fight. In that same survey, 52% of the 2,000-person sample questioned said they approved of Calderon's approach to combating cartels. Analysts offer different assessments of whether Calderon's drug war strategy worked. Some have argued that the president entered the battle without realizing the enemy's capabilities. ""I think the adversary was larger and more harmful than we thought,"" security expert Eduardo Guerrero told CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol in 2010. ""It was much more capable of responding to the government's strategy, and getting stronger."" Others have said Calderon had no choice but to move forward. ""When Calderon came to power, it was already going on. The only option was to use the army and the federal police. If he hadn't done it ... in no time you would have organized crime controlling the country,"" Jorge Chabat, who studies security at Mexico's Center for Research and Teaching in Economics, said last year. ""If he had waited until the army and police were prepared, Mexico would have more kidnappings, more extortion. He had no other option. It was a bad option, but the others were worse."" Defiant former Mexican mayor assassinated . But critics, like the peace movement that protested Wednesday, have said Calderon's administration hasn't done enough to help the drug war's victims. And activists have accused his government of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses committed by police and troops fighting the drug war. In his September state of the union address, Calderon defended his approach, and said abuses by authorities combating cartels were the exception, not the rule. ""And far from hiding them,"" he said, ""in all the cases that were brought to light, action was taken against those responsible."" This week, in his home state of Michoacan, where Calderon first announced his crackdown on cartels, banners with farewell messages addressed to him hung from prominent bridges. They were purportedly signed by the Knights Templar, a splinter cartel that surged in the state last year. Calderon heads to Harvard . President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto, who takes office Saturday, has said he plans to take a different approach, focusing on reducing violence. He has offered few specifics about how his security policies will differ from Calderon's strategy, but he's said that change is coming. ""We will keep the policies that I think work,"" Pena Nieto said this week, ""including cooperation with the United States to effectively fight organized crime."" As Pena Nieto prepared to take the reins this week, Mexicans learned the answer to a question that has been the subject of much speculation: Where will Calderon go, now that his term is ending? Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government announced Wednesday that the outgoing Mexican president will spend the next year as a global public leaders fellow at the school. ""President Calderon is a vivid example of a dynamic and committed public servant, who took on major challenges in Mexico,"" David T. Ellwood, the school's dean, said in a statement. Hours after the announcement, a Mexican researcher who is studying ethics and corruption at Harvard this year said university officials should reconsider the move. ""I am alarmed that Harvard will protect a person as unethical as Felipe Calderon,"" Irma E. Sandoval wrote in a Twitter post. Sandoval, who is a fellow this year at Harvard's Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and also heads a corruption and transparency research laboratory at Mexico's National Autonomous University, said she was hoping others at Harvard would join her in protesting Calderon's appointment. The outgoing president, she told CNN, does not deserve the one-year fellowship. ""He is handing over a country in flames,"" she said. At the end of the video released by the Mexican president's office Wednesday, Calderon strides down the steps of his official residence. ""As a citizen I will continue serving the country passionately until the end of my days, always grateful for the privilege I have been given to be Mexican. Many thanks, and see you soon, Mexico,"" the president says. He looks up toward a flag, fluttering in the sky.

"(CNN) -- A young, beloved teacher found killed in the woods. A 14-year-old student in custody, charged with her murder. That much we know. But hours after both were found -- one dead, one alive -- in suburbs northeast of Boston, much remains unknown as to why Colleen Ritzer was brutally slain. ""It's just surreal how quickly someone can go, and how much we take for granted everyday,"" said Danvers High School student Chris Weimert, describing Ritzer as ""the nicest teacher you could ever have. ... I can't believe it."" Authorities had been looking for the student, Philip Chism, first, after he was reported missing -- with police sending out messages via Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday evening, noting he'd been last seen around 6:30 p.m. and asking for the public's help in finding him. They got a call around 11:20 p.m. about another missing person, 24-year-old Ritzer, after she, too, hadn't returned home and was not answering her phone, according to Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett. A flurry of activity came next. Police in Topsfield, the town just north of Danvers, around 12:30 a.m. spotted Chism walking alongside a busy road there. Authorities also converged on Danvers High -- where Ritzer taught and which Chism attended -- finding blood in a second-floor bathroom, the district attorney said. The teacher's body was soon discovered behind the school. Chism was tied to Ritzer's death after police interviewed him and reviewed video surveillance from the school, a criminal complaint states. In court, it was alleged the teenager ""did assault and beat"" Ritzer, leading to her death. ""Based on his statements and the corroborating evidence found at multiple scenes at ... Danvers High School and surrounding wooded area, the juvenile was subsequently placed into custody and booked for murder,"" adds the complaint. Read the complaint . The 14-year-old was arraigned Wednesday afternoon in a Salem, Massachusetts, court for murder, then ordered held without bail. A grand jury could decide if Chism will be charged as an adult. Meanwhile, the tight-knit community of Danvers is at a loss to explain why someone might take the life of Ritzer, a 24-year-old known for posting inspirational messages on her Twitter account and offering students extra help when they needed it. As the greater Bay State community paid its respects with a moment of silence before the Boston Red Sox began Game 1 of the World Series at Fenway Park, many heartbroken former students of hers gathered for a vigil outside the town's high school. All seven schools in the North Shore town closed Wednesday, as investigators did their work and students and residents mourned the loss of Ritzer. Everything will reopen Thursday except the high school, but counselors and grief specialists will be available there for two hours during the day, said Superintendent Lisa Dana. Classes throughout the town are set to resume Friday, she said. ""I don't know why she had to die,"" freshman Spencer Wade said of Ritzer, adding that the mysterious and bloody nature of her death made it even harder to deal with. ""She was such a wonderful person."" Suspect had lived in 3 states in recent years . Just Monday, the Danvers Police Department was tweeting its support for families and first responders affected by the shooting death of a Sparks, Nevada, teacher -- allegedly at the hands of a 12-year-old boy. While no motive has been spelled out in Ritzer's death, some details have started to emerge about the the young suspect. Chism attended fourth grade at a Clarksville, Tennessee, elementary school, said Clarksville-Montgomery County, Tennessee, school system spokeswoman Elise Shelton. He then spent fifth grade at Hammock Pointe Elementary in Boca Raton, Florida, according to Palm Beach County school spokesman Owen Torres. The next three years, he was back in Tennessee at Rossview Middle School in Clarksville, according to Shelton. Then his family moved about 1,150 miles northeast to Massachusetts. Specifically, he was in Danvers, a town of about 26,000 people, and went to its lone public high school. Students said Chism played soccer there, describing him as somewhat quiet but still an active participant in class who had friends. ""He ... seemed quiet and reserved, but he just seemed normal,"" said Ariana Edwards, who was in Chism's English class. Chism didn't drink, do drugs and came from a good family, one of his closest friends said. He described Chism as a good athlete who was shy at first but eventually warmed up to people, adding he hadn't been acting strangely lately. This friend and others got their first hint something was awry when Chism didn't show up for soccer practice. The team ended up setting out to look for their teammate, after seeing texts that he was missing. As they and police were looking for him -- and after Ritzer was killed -- Chism went to the movies, a source with knowledge of the investigation said. Blodgett declined Wednesday to offer specifics on the relationship between the suspect and the late teacher, though his office said Chism attended one of Ritzer's classes. When authorities first reported Chism missing on Tuesday, people responded on the police department's Facebook page with prayers for his ""safe return."" One neighbor described him as ""a polite and friendly boy."" The tenor of the comments changed significantly once he was linked to Ritzer's killing. ""I'd say he's less 'polite and friendly' than you thought,"" wrote one Facebook commenter. ""Everybody has to keep their eyes open. It's no longer safe to say that you can take everybody at face value."" 'The sweetest, most harmless person ever' Ritzer graduated from Assumption College in 2011, that school said on Twitter. She was pursuing a master's degree in school counseling at Salem State University, that school said. ""She believed children have much to offer and often do not realize how special they are as individuals,"" the university said. ""In her application to Salem State she said she was dedicated to 'helping students in times of need.'"" Charlotte Dzerkacz in 2011 taught at the same middle school with Ritzer, during which time the two became close friends. At all times, Ritzer wore a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike. ""She was energetic, she was compassionate,"" Dzerkacz said. ""You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend."" Like Dzerkacz, Ritzer's aunt Shirley Martellucci said her niece never had any trouble with students -- including during the past two years, when she was at Danvers High. ""She always wanted to be a teacher, all her life,"" Martellucci said. ""It's just unbelievable that someone would take her life at such a young age."" On her Twitter account, Ritzer interspersed homework assignments and exhortations to work through tough math problems with cooking talk and inspirational messages. ""No matter what happens in life, be good to people,"" she wrote in August. ""Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind."" Her family issued a statement seeking privacy as they mourn their ""amazing, beautiful daughter and sister."" ""Everyone that knew and loved Colleen knew of her passion for teaching and how she mentored each and every one of her students,"" the family said in the statement. Students at Danvers High echoed that sentiment, as well as that of her school district describing Ritzer as ""a dynamic and brilliant ray of light."" In the halls, she was guaranteed to offer a warm smile. In class, she could be counted on to give an appreciated pat on the back. Even once the final bell sounded, she could always be counted on to offer teaching, guidance and support. ""She was always the teacher (who would) go the extra mile for students, always the teacher to be there for students after school,"" said Kyle Cahill. ""It's just crazy."" Debate unfolds after teacher slayings in Nevada, Massachusetts . CNN's Dana Garrett, Laurie Segall, Eden Pontz, Rob Frehse, Rose Arce, Chandler Friedman, Stephanie Gallman, Alexis Weiss and Bob Crowley, as well as journalist Alexandra Field, contributed to this report.","NEW: The suspect went to a movie theater after allegedly killing his teacher, source says .

"Orlando (CNN) -- ""Oi -- Sejam bem-vindos!"" -- meaning ""Hi, welcome!"" -- is a Portuguese phrase heard more and more these days at Florida's tourist spots. That's because Florida is the top U.S. vacation destination for Brazilians, who are taking advantage of a favorable exchange rate and low prices. Brazilians outnumbered all other international travelers to Florida in 2011, up 41% from the previous year, according to state tourism officials. And there's no sign of this Brazilian invasion slowing down: The U.S. Commerce Department projects 1.5 million Brazilians will visit the United States in 2012 -- and most of them will head to Florida. Floridians are used to seeing Brazilian tour groups marching through outlet malls and theme parks, usually dressed in matching T-shirts in single-file lines behind their leader. These Brazilian tourists are usually loaded with cash and ready to clear the shelves of the name-brand outlets. That's because even at regular price, many goods and services in the United States are much cheaper than in Brazil, where tariffs, taxes and transportation costs can mean higher prices. ""We [took] about 15,000 passengers on shopping tours, and they on average spend about $300 to $400 each person,"" said Claudia Menezes, vice president of Pegasus Transportation. And those were just the Brazilian tour groups visiting outlet malls and theme parks in South Florida and Orlando. Menezes says she expects her business to double in 2012. That could be a conservative estimate as the United States plans to expand its global entry program, which aims to speed up the visa approval process for international visitors. President Obama announced the expansion of the plan last week at a news conference at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. He said he hopes to make it easier for visitors from countries ""with rapidly growing economies, huge populations and emerging middle classes"" like Brazil and China to visit the United States. He said he wants the plan expanded ""this year."" He said Brazil was ""especially important for Florida"" because it has ""a huge population that loves to come to Florida ... but we make it too hard for them."" ""We want them spending money here, in Orlando, in Florida in the United States of America, which will boost our businesses and our economy,"" he said. It's a long process for many Brazilians to get to the United States: On average, people have to wait 76 days just to get an interview at the largest U.S. consulate in Brazil, in Sao Paulo. And with only four U.S. consular offices in a country that is bigger than the continental United States, a lot of Brazilians trying to visit the U.S. must travel long distances for their interview. As a result, many are opting to travel to Europe because the visa process is easier. Menezes says her tour business depends on the United States improving its visa process: . ""If they make it easier, it would be even more people coming here,"" she said. On a recent afternoon at the Orlando Premium Outlets near Disney World, one of the hottest-selling items among the Brazilian tourists is luggage. They buy the suitcases, then stuff them with recently purchased shoes, clothing, bags and electronics until the luggage is almost bursting at the seams. That kind of spending has translated into billions of dollars in revenue for the United States. In 2010, Brazilian visitors spent nearly $6 billion on U.S. travel and tourism-related goods and services, nearly 30% more than the prior year, according to a report from the U.S. Commerce Department. It's a trend that has been going on since 2003 and has, according to the report, ""propelled Brazil up the rankings to become the fifth largest international market for U.S. travel and tourism-related exports."" Florida's retailers aren't the only ones getting an economic boost: Many of Central Florida's numerous theme parks have also seen a large increase in Brazilian tourists. Disney World says 2011 was a record-breaking year for Brazilian guests at its parks. As a result, Disney hired 54 Portuguese-speaking ""Super Greeters,"" most of them from Brazil, to assist Brazilian tour groups throughout Disney's parks. SeaWorld Orlando has seen a steady increase in guests from Brazil over the past five years, says Peter Frey, senior marketing officer with SeaWorld Parks. As a result, SeaWorld recently launched a website in Portuguese, and Frey says the company is looking to expand its Portuguese-speaking employees. ""We are offering classes for employees to learn the basics of Portuguese,"" he said. Brazil's economy is booming after a quick recovery from the global economic downturn, and a new class of Brazilians is traveling and spending money, giving Florida a much-needed economic shot in the arm, according to Sean Snaith, an economics expert at the University of Central Florida. ""There is an emerging middle class [in Brazil] who has disposable income,"" he said. Only a few years ago, Brazilian tourists were not always welcomed by shop owners in Central and South Florida, a tour guide said. Today, businesses are catering to these cash-laden Brazilian tourists. Brazilians are also investing in Florida's sagging real estate market, particularly in South Florida, either for a vacation home or just as an investment. The prices in Miami are a bargain, compared with the prices in Brazil, according to Miami Realtor Cristiano Piquet. ""In Brazil or Rio, high-end real estate is around $1,000 per square foot, while in Miami, you can find high-end oceanfront property, like the Trump Towers, for only $500 per square foot,"" said Piquet, who gets 80% of his business from Brazilians. He has 75 agents. ""Brazilians love Miami, the weather is similar to Brazil, [it's] very safe ... [and there are] daily flights from Brazil to Miami,"" he said. Diego Gasques from Rio de Janeiro, who owns two condominiums in Miami, agrees. ""It's kind of a vacation place for us,"" he said. ""Of course Miami is a beautiful place, a lot of nice people around -- a lot of bodies ... it's a nice place to hang out to have some fun."" While Spanish is still the most popular second language in most South Florida businesses, these days it's becoming more common to hear, ""Obrigada e volte sempre!"" -- Portuguese for "" Thank you, come again!""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Bartendaz of New York want to serve as many young people as possible -- and that's a good thing. One of the Bartendaz, Metaphysics, performs the flag move during a demonstration at an Atlanta-area school. These fitness gurus aren't promoting underage drinking. Named for the creative moves they perform on the pull-up bar, the Bartendaz are empowering youths through calisthenics. By ditching free weights and weight machines in favor of using their own body weight on the bar and the floor, the Bartendaz have developed a series of acrobatic strength exercises that have sparked attention on YouTube and from such celebrity clients as rapper Ludacris and mixed martial arts champion Rashad Evans. Some members also earned a stint with New York's Apollo Circus of Soul. But Bartendaz founder Hassan Yasin's proudest achievement is his program's impact on youths. ""My number one claim to fame [is] ... when I walk in the park and they're not chilling on the benches, they're at the bars,"" said Yasin, 40. ""All the guys that [were] hanging out there, taking up space, [are] now leaving because there's too many youth coming back."" Dozens of New York City schools have adopted Bartendaz moves into their physical education programs through grass-roots networking, Yasin said. He believes the exercises resonate among students who have been otherwise tough to reach.  See the Bartendaz in action Â» . The Brooklyn Academy High School for at-risk students incorporated the program into its curriculum to motivate students to become more involved in physical education, said principal Elaine Lindsey. But the kids love it so much, she said, that it became ""a tool to motivate the students to actually come to school."" The minimal equipment makes it financially and logistically accessible without the need of a gym. And the use of body weight, instead of free weights, keeps it safe for young bodies, said Dr. Stephen Sanders, the director of the School of Physical Education and Exercise Science at the University of South Florida. As a general rule, children should not lift heavy weights until after puberty, when their muscles are more mature, said Sanders, who is not affiliated with the Bartendaz. The Brooklyn Academy was unable to afford the Bartendaz visits this year, which Yasin says cost about $400 to $600 per session for 25 to 30 students. But, Lindsey said, ""Once they mastered it here, they could always do it [at] home or anywhere."" The Bartendaz have also found success teaching juvenile and adult inmates at Rikers Island, the New York jail facility -- an idea met with resistance about five years ago. "" 'Don't bring fitness in there. They're in jail, what are you doing?' "" Yasin said, quoting early critics. ""I said, 'It's like stress management. Give us an opportunity to present it.' Once we presented it, that was it. We started putting bars in the yard so the young men can work out."" ""They put us in the worst buildings, the most violent, and we became a breath of fresh air because there [are] no organizations going inside. So for one to come inside, it gives ... the inmates the opportunity to come out and say, 'Let me listen to what they have to offer. And now I can get out of my cell,' "" Yasin said. Learning from someone who's been there . This wasn't Yasin's first experience with the New York City Department of Corrections. A native of Manhattan's Lower East Side, he spent four years behind bars in his early 20s and did time at a juvenile facility at age 17, both for drug-related charges. After his release in the early 1990s, Yasin cleaned up his act and became a motivational speaker -- talking to New York youths about substance abuse awareness, conflict resolution, gang prevention and leadership -- which evolved into his nonprofit, Giant Thinking. Meanwhile, he was honing his acrobatic skills on the pull-up bars at local parks, and eventually gained a following and partners-in-training. Having built up respect from teachers and administrators at New York City schools, Yasin and his team were tasked with developing a program to get kids to stop cutting gym class. ""The ultimate thing was ... how can we do this in a way we don't have to use a whole bunch of equipment?"" said Dr. G (short for Dr. Goodbody), one of the Bartendaz whom Yasin consulted in developing the school initiative. ""So the concept of anytime, anywhere exercises came about."" Today, as the Bartendaz visit schools and other facilities, they divide their time between spreading the positive messages of Giant Thinking and the fitness training of Bartendaz. The model effectively held the attention of students at Crossroads Second Chance South. Through a partnership with Atlanta, Georgia, nonprofit Next Century Youth, the Bartendaz recently held a series of demonstrations in the Atlanta area, including Crossroads South, an alternative high school for students who have been expelled. After high-fiving one another for successfully naming 10 fruits that promote good health, the Crossroads South students gave a standing ovation for their classmates as they joined the Bartendaz for compound moves on the pull-up bar and on the floor for pushups. Exercising at the pull-up bar brings a camaraderie that you don't see among weight lifters, Yasin said. ""[You see] healthy competition and a lot of smiling going on, versus the aggression"" involved in weight lifting, Yasin said. There's ""nothing to talk about when you're lifting weights. They're dead serious."" Crossroads South PE teacher Rachelle Bradley said she hoped to work further with the Bartendaz to incorporate their moves into her teaching. ""It's very practical, not something structured. ... Our students don't like structure, and this is more creative,"" Bradley said. Bartendaz fan Justin Kemp, 18, found the group on YouTube about a year ago and took on its exercise techniques soon after. Before long, he went from doing three pushups during television commercial breaks to being able to do 100 to 150 consecutively, he said. ""I feel challenged,"" Kemp said. ""I love when I'm challenged because ... it keeps me on top of my game.""","Bartendaz perform compound fitness moves using a pull-up bar, body weight .

"Atlanta (CNN)  -- Imagine paying as much for water as you do for your mortgage. Residents throughout Atlanta are outraged by hundreds, even thousands of dollars in monthly spikes in their water bills, and have questioned the legitimacy of the charges for years. Now, they're demanding answers. ""I thought we were sinking in a hole of water,"" said Debbi Scarborough. ""It scared me to death. I thought we had a major leak when I got the bill."" Over two months last summer, her family's monthly water bill, shot up to $1,805 In July and then $1,084 in August, leaving a balance due of more than $3,000. She said in the past her bill has averaged $200 to $250. ""I'm not paying a $3,000 bill. And for those three months, we were pretty much out of town most of the time and there's no leaks,"" she said, showing CNN a copy of her plumber's report. The city installed a device on her meter to track daily usage. In the meantime, Scarborough's bill remains unpaid while she disputes the charges. She is not alone. While similar complaints about huge water bill spikes have popped up in Cleveland, Ohio; Charlotte, North Carolina; Tampa, Florida; and Brockton, Massachusetts; it appears that the issue has lasted the longest in Atlanta. See how top 50 cities rank . It's led to a class-action lawsuit, countless meetings with city officials and continuing complaints from fed-up residents. Thousands of residents who have seen unusual spikes have appealed their high water bills. Just last year, the city issued credits totaling $466,368 to customers. Atlanta, with more than 500,000 residents, says it already has the highest water rates of any major city in the United States, due in part to federal consent decrees to overhaul the city's water supply infrastructure. Many of the problems arose after the installation of new, automated water meters, which began nearly five years ago, and involved contracts for meter installations, the electronic meters and software equipment. The automated meter-reading technology eliminates the need for city workers to manually check every meter. Instead, they retrieve the data by driving by each property. The meter electronically transmits data showing the amount of water used. From the beginning, there were problems. In 2007, city auditors found they were ""unable to verify electronic meter readings"" because of ""meter read errors, equipment failures or human errors."" Specifically, the audit said ""about 9% of the meters could not be read due to broken or malfunctioning equipment."" Two years later, another audit concluded that a ""high number of accounts"" were not getting ""actual meter readings"" because of ""meter read errors, equipment failures or human errors."" CNN reviewed hundreds of complaints from Atlanta residents as well as city e-mails obtained through a public records request. On August 26, 2010, Mitch Elliott, a sales executive of Neptune Technologies, which manufactured the meters, wrote to a city official: ""It has been an industry experience that typically when a utility does an AMR (automatic meter reading) meter changeout and also switches software billing companies that generally high bill complaints are either due to new meter accuracy and/or a billing multiplier error."" Elliott would not comment, referring CNN to city officials. Peter Aman, the city of Atlanta's chief operating officer, said in an interview that he realized at that time the situation was serious. He's been on the job since January 2010. Last September, he replaced senior management in the Atlanta Dept. of Watershed Management. He said the city has sampled about 9,000 of the 132,954 residential meters and made a major discovery: About 1% of the meters' registers, which show how much water is being used, and the meter base underneath do not properly fit. That mismatch could result in a doubling of the water bill, Aman said. ""These two components don't match and guess what? They're labeled. This one says three-quarter (inch) on it and this one has a ""1"" (inch) on it. Now, it's small print but it's big enough to see,"" Aman said. That would explain a billing multiplier error, which leads to higher bills, he said. He added that the problem was first ""identified in the audit back in (2007) and [the city] put in place, or were supposed to put in place, a whole system of checks and balances as they went through the rest of the system upgrade, and clearly they failed because we're still finding these mismatches out there."" Experts: U.S. water infrastructure in trouble . Operators of Lenox Square Mall and Phipps Plaza, two large shopping malls, complained about water billings ""nearly $300,000 over last year for this same period of time,"" according to another e-mail. ""There appears to be serious errors in the water billings that are creating huge hardships for both centers,"" wrote Michael F. Romstead, regional vice president of Mid Atlantic Mall of Georgia. ""We need the city's full attention to correct the problem."" The city responded by changing the meters' registers. Romstead did not return calls to check whether the bills had gone back to normal, but there are no follow-up complaints in the city records supplied to CNN. Asked about problems with the rest of the meters, Aman said, ""The majority of the people who complain about high water bills have some issue that is not associated with the meter. Many, many of them have either leaks, or increases in usage through irrigation or pool filling that they didn't fully understand the impact of, but that's not to minimize the fact that we do have some cases of meters that aren't functioning properly. And we're addressing those on a case-by-case basis and giving people their money back. To me, the story here is there has been a complete loss of trust between the city and its citizens and its customers."" The city has not found issues with meter manufacturer Neptune Technologies Inc. or Systems and Software Inc. which installed the billing software, Aman said. Executives at both companies declined interview requests. Two other contractors that installed meters at commercial locations did not return calls. ""We have not found a smoking gun, if you will, in terms of a system problem,"" Aman told CNN. However, he said the company that installed the residential meters should be held accountable. KHAFRA, an Atlanta-based firm, joined a Pennsylvania company to carry out the $40.3 million contract. After months of calls, KHAFRA President Valentino Bates agreed to an interview, but only after CNN had spoken to Aman. ""When we ended the contract in December of 2009, we had a 90-day window to come in and address any concerns. No concerns were brought to us. So as of today sitting here with you, it is our understanding that the meters are functioning properly as they were supposed to when we installed them,"" Bates said. He said the company had identified 968 meters that had the mismatching problem, and fixed all of them by last March. The project, he said, was ""very successful"" and he added that he had not been informed about additional meter issues. Asked if his company would repair any other meters the city said were not correctly installed, Bates told CNN, ""If it is our problem, we will do that."" Meanwhile, Atlanta residents continue to complain to the city, which received more than 22,000 calls to its Department of Watershed Management in January. And last year alone, there were a total of 12,291 water bill disputes, according to the city. ""Clearly, people are upset, and one of the things that we said to people is that we hear you and that we do believe we have problems in the water meter and billing system,"" Aman said. That doesn't convince residents like Wilda Cobb, who is astounded at a water bill that now totals $10,071. Her bill spiked to more than $1,200 in November, then skyrocketed to $6,879 in December. ""I am furious, I am upset, I'm confused,"" Cobb said. ""I can't get an answer from the city because they won't admit there is a problem."" A city official reviewed Cobb's bills, and said the unusually high usage for the two months would normally mean there was some kind of leak, possibly with the irrigation system. The city installed a data logger meter that tracks usage during each day. Her latest bill is down to just $34. Ironically, Cobb knows something about water issues. She's an attorney for the Environmental Protection Agency. ""As I person, I know something's wrong here,"" Cobb said. ""As an attorney, what can I do about it? But, I don't think it takes a law degree to say $7,000 for a month's use of water by one person in a small home is just crazy without a leak."" Watch CNN Newsroom weekdays 9am to 3pm ET and weekends.

"LAREDO, Texas (CNN)  -- Rosalio Reta sits at a table inside a Laredo Police Department interrogation room. A detective, sitting across the table, asks him how it all started. Gabriel Cardona, who shows his tattooed eyelids, worked as a hit man for a Mexican cartel. Reta, in Spanish street slang, describes his initiation as an assassin, at the age of 13, for the Mexican Gulf Cartel, one of the country's two major drug gangs. ""I thought I was Superman. I loved doing it, killing that first person,"" Reta says on the videotape obtained by CNN. ""They tried to take the gun away, but it was like taking candy from kid."" Rosalio Reta and his friend, Gabriel Cardona, were members of a three-person cell of American teenagers working as cartel hit men in the United States, according to prosecutors. The third was arrested by Mexican authorities and stabbed to death in prison there three days later. In interviews with CNN, Laredo police detectives and prosecutors told how Cardona and Reta were recruited by the cartel to be assassins after they began hitting the cantinas and clubs just across the border.  Watch how the teens turned into drug cartel hitmen Â» . CNN has also obtained detailed court records as well as several hours of police interrogation videos. The detective sitting across the table from Reta and Cardona in those sessions is Robert Garcia. He's a veteran of the Laredo Police Department and one of the few officers who has questioned the young men. ""One thing you wonder all the time: What made them this way?"" Garcia told CNN. ""They were just kids themselves, waiting around playing PlayStation or Xbox, waiting around for the order to be given."" Over a nearly one-year period starting in June 2005, the border town of Laredo, Texas, saw a string of seven murders. At first glance, the violence looked like isolated, gangland-style killings. But investigators started suspecting something more sinister. Then Noe Flores was gunned down in a clear case of mistaken identity. Investigators found a fingerprint on a cigarette box inside the suspected shooter's get-away car. That clue unraveled the chilling reality and led police to arrest Gabriel Cardona and Rosalio Reta. Prosecutors say they quickly discovered these two teenagers were homegrown assassins, hired to carry out the dirty work of the notorious Gulf Cartel. ""There are sleeper cells in the U.S.,"" said Detective Garcia. ""They're here, they're here in the United States."" The cases against Cardona and Reta -- both are in prison serving long prison sentences for murder -- shed new light into the workings of the drug cartels. Prosecutor and investigators say Reta and Cardona were recruited into a group called ""Los Zetas,"" a group made up of former members of the Mexican special military forces. They're considered ruthless in how they carry out attacks. ""Los Zetas"" liked what they saw in Cardona and Reta. Both teenagers received six-month military-style training on a Mexican ranch. Investigators say Cardona and Reta were paid $500 a week each as a retainer, to sit and wait for the call to kill. Then they were paid up to $50,000 and 2 kilos of cocaine for carrying out a hit. The teenagers lived in several safe houses around Laredo and drove around town in a $70,000 Mercedes-Benz. As the teens became more immersed in the cartel lifestyle, their appearance changed. Cardona had eyeballs tattooed on his eyelids. Reta's face became covered in tattoo markings. (Prosecutors say during his trial Reta used make-up to cover the facial markings.) And both sported tattoos of ""Santa Muerte,"" the Grim Reaper-like pseudo-saint worshipped by drug traffickers. ""These organizations, these cartels, they function like a Fortune 500 company,"" Webb County, Texas, prosecutor Uriel Druker said. ""We have to remember that the United States is the market they are trying to get to."" In Cardona's interrogation tape, there are clues that ""Los Zetas"" are reaching deeper and deeper into the United States. Cardona is asked, ""Where else are the Zetas?"" And Cardona responds, ""I've heard in Dallas and Houston."" And that's why the cartel recruited these young Americans. Cardona and Reta could move freely and easily back and forth across the border with Mexico. Just hours before they were arrested, federal authorities taped a phone conversation between them in which Cardona brags about killing 14-year-old Inez Villareal and his cousin, a Cardona rival. Cardona laughs as he describes torturing the two boys and dumping their bodies in large metal drums filled with diesel fuel. He says he made ""guiso,"" or stew, with their bodies. As the call ends, Cardona says, ""There are three left to kill, there are three left.""","U.S. teens are accused of acting as Mexican cartel hit men in Laredo, Texas .

"(CNN) -- What's better than a bull in a China shop? Three cows in a parking lot -- elephant cows, that is. The trunked trio -- all circus stars in St. Louis, Missouri -- found a way out of their enclosure Saturday and went for a stroll. Eyewitnesses told CNN affiliate KSDK that loud noises from circus goers had spooked the elephants, and they fled. But the three only made it to the parking lot, where they dinged two cars and were eventually rounded up by their handlers, according Dennis Burkholder, spokesman for St. Louis' Shriners. The parking lot belongs to them, and the elephants may well, too -- they work for the Moolah Shrine Circus, where they strut their stuff on their hind legs under the big top to earn their keep. One handler trying to corral the elephants wanted to tempt them with treats, circus goer Allie Tunncliff told KSDK. She captured video of an elephant between cars. ""She yelled to one guy, 'I need anything, just pretzels, any kind of food,' "" Tunncliff said. Burkholder said the parking lot is private and not accessible to the public. The damaged cars belong to circus employees or Shriners -- whom the circus website describes as men in ""funny red hats, who drive little yellow cars, dress like clowns."" The elephants didn't get any significant dents or scratches, but after their ordeal, the circus gave them a break for Saturday's night's performance, Burkholder said. The show goes on on Sunday.

"(CNN) -- J.D. Salinger, the famously reclusive author whose 1951 novel, ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" became a touchstone for generations of readers, has died. He was 91. The author died Wednesday of natural causes at his home in New Hampshire, according to a family statement that his literary agent, Phyllis Westberg, provided Thursday. ""Despite having broken his hip in May, his health had been excellent until a rather sudden decline after the new year,"" the statement said. ""He was not in any pain before or at the time of his death."" Salinger has long been known for his reclusiveness, and ""in keeping with his life long, uncompromising desire to protect and defend his privacy there will be no service,"" the statement said. ""The family asks that people's respect for him, his work, and his privacy be extended to them, individually and collectively, during this time."" Though he wrote more than 30 short stories and a handful of novellas -- many published in The New Yorker and collected in works such as ""Nine Stories"" and ""Seymour: An Introduction"" -- Salinger's fame rests on ""Catcher,"" his only novel. The book is narrated by a teenage boy, Holden Caulfield, who is expelled from a private school, Pencey Prep, in Pennsylvania, and spends the next three days wandering around New York. Caulfield is mistrustful of authority, railing against corrupt adults and ""phonies,"" and plans to decamp for the west. iReport: Tell us what 'Catcher' meant to you . ""An unusually brilliant first novel,"" The New York Times called it, one of many raves. Though intended for adult readers, the book touched a nerve among teenagers attracted by Caulfield's nonconformist attitudes and has remained a best-seller since its release. It has gone through dozens of printings in its simple mass-market paperback edition, clad in a simple maroon cover adorned with the title and author's name on the front and back. It's also been a lightning rod for controversy. Schools have banned it -- troubled by Caulfield's language and attitude as well as his adventures with a prostitute -- and some readers have been obsessed by it, most infamously Mark David Chapman, who murdered John Lennon in 1980. In 2009, Salinger -- always protective of his work -- sued to stop the publication, sale and advertisement of ""60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye,"" a novel written by an author calling himself J.D. California. Jerome David Salinger was born January 1, 1919, in New York City, the son of Sol -- a wealthy meat importer -- and Miriam Salinger. He attended Valley Forge Military Academy in Pennsylvania and spent time at three colleges. He published his first stories in the early 1940s. In 1942, he joined the U.S. Army. He fought in the D-Day invasion at Normandy as well as the Battle of the Bulge, but suffered a nervous breakdown and checked himself into an Army hospital in Germany in 1945. In December of that year, ""I'm Crazy,"" the first story featuring Caulfield, was published in Collier's. In 1947, his short story ""A Perfect Day for Bananafish,"" featuring the troubled Seymour Glass, was published in The New Yorker. The Glass family, a group of bright siblings who agonized over their lives, would become the subject of many subsequent stories, all of which were published in The New Yorker and later collected in ""Nine Stories,"" ""Franny and Zooey"" and ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction."" His last published story, ""Hapworth 16, 1924,"" appeared in 1965. In his later life, Salinger became as well-known for his desire for privacy as his work, and when that privacy was shattered, he would sometimes lash out with lawsuits. A 1987 biography by Ian Hamilton was blocked by a U.S. appellate court; it eventually appeared, in heavily revised form, as ""In Search of J.D. Salinger."" Salinger also sued a writer, Stephen Kunes, for impersonating him. He had a nine-month affair with the 18-year-old Joyce Maynard in the early '70s; she later wrote about it in a memoir and auctioned off his letters. (The buyer, Peter Norton, said he would return the letters to Salinger.) Salinger's daughter, Margaret, wrote a memoir, ""Dream Catcher,"" which was published in 2000. Neither Maynard's nor Margaret Salinger's books were positive, describing the author as controlling and having a host of unusual habits, including drinking his own urine. Throughout it all, Salinger remained determinedly reserved. He gave interviews sparingly, the last one in 1981 to The (Baton Rouge, Louisiana) Advocate. Occasionally he would release terse statements about his work. Thursday's statement from Salinger's literary agent acknowledged the writer's isolation. ""Salinger had remarked that he was in this world but not of it. His body is gone but the family hopes that he is still with those he loves, whether they are religious or historical figures, personal friends or fictional characters,"" the statement said. ""He will be missed by the few he was close to every bit as much as by the readers who loved reading him."" Salinger was married three times, most recently to Colleen O'Neil, who survives him. He had two children, Matthew and Margaret, with his second wife, Claire Douglas, whom he divorced in 1967.","Reclusive author dies Wednesday at New Hampshire home .

"(CNN) -- I'm proud to be Ukrainian. Born in America and raised in a bilingual home, pierogies, borscht and pysanky (Ukrainian Easter eggs) were all staples in my life. So was Ukrainian school -- where I was taught history, culture, literature and grammar every Saturday morning for 13 years -- and Ukrainian scouts and Ukrainian dancing. It is nearly impossible to separate me from the culture. And I would never want that. That's what makes it so hard to see the images of escalating violence on TV among the Ukrainian people -- with whom I feel such a connection. To many of them, the protests are fueled by memories of Soviet control and fears that Russia will use its economic pressure to pull Ukraine back into its orbit. The oppression of the Soviet system is why my father fled the country 75 years ago, when he was only 18. He loved Ukraine but escaped Soviet rule to build a new life in America. Transplanting that Ukrainian identity into Parma, Ohio, was not always easy. And growing up in the Midwest, when I would tell someone I was Ukrainian, I was often met with a confused look. That was generally followed by, ""So you speak Russian?"" I can't blame them for making that assumption. After all, Ukraine was the second biggest country in the USSR. But there was no particular pride in that: Hatred of the Soviets runs deep among many Ukrainians. For my father, the flight from Ukraine -- with his two brothers, sister, father and mother -- was dangerous and difficult. He made his way to America via Germany during World War II. He survived the bombing of Dresden, and his family got separated. They eventually found each other once they all landed safely in the United States, but for a frightened interval, they had no idea whether the others were alive or dead. My sister, brother and I grew up riveted by my father's and uncle's stories about dodging the authorities to escape. My father told of avoiding soldiers as he walked among the dead after the bombing in Dresden; they had shoot-to-kill orders for anyone who might be looting. It was like listening to a live thriller or spy novel. My father may not have spoken English when he arrived in America, but he was determined. He mastered the language and went on to become a chief financial officer of Cardinal Federal Savings & Loan in Cleveland. He dreamed of the day Ukraine would become independent, as did my mother -- a Ukrainian born in America. Both died before they could see it. But I saw it. And in 1992, I traveled to the country on a Teach English program sponsored by a Ukrainian organization. It was a time when Ukraine was like the Wild West. The country had just elected a new president and was newly independent -- but many didn't really know what that meant. When I arrived in Kiev, I assumed everyone would speak Ukrainian and that I would fit right in. I was mistaken, as many spoke Russian. More alarming to me was when I realized I didn't know who to ask for help in finding a telephone. In America, it was easy. You just ask a cop. In Ukraine, there were many different uniforms -- not so easy. (Hint: Ask the old lady, or babushka -- works every time.) One thing was crystal clear: There was a thirst for the West. After years of oppression, my students wanted to learn everything they could from me about America. One young girl even said her dream was to go to Disneyland (whose isn't?) As a ""homeland journey,"" for me it was at times a surreal experience. I was suddenly seeing all the things I had only learned about in books. (Swimming in the Black Sea was not something you just dreamed about in Ukrainian school!) Even more precious was when my sister and I traveled to Ivano-Frankivsk, the city of my family. My sister and I saw the school where our grandfather taught and the pond where our father and his siblings went skating. That my father and his family could leave such a place -- leave behind everything they knew -- and make a courageous leap of faith into a new country where they could not even speak the language filled me with admiration. I have never felt more grateful to them for making that trek as when I met some local Ukrainians who said they wished their families had done what mine did. That's when it really hit me that I could leave that country, but their lives were going to be much more difficult. As I watch the violent and deadly protests from afar, I think now about all these people. I see in the Ukrainians locked in confrontation the same national pride with which I was raised. They no longer want to leave. They want to have a strong independent nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Catherine Tymkiw.","Catherine Tymkiw is a proud Ukrainian-American, raised in traditions of parents' homeland .

"(Mashable) -- Is it just me or is the ICANN plan to corral online porn going terribly wrong? We already have reports that universities are snapping up XXX domains in an effort to get ahead of porn pranksters who want to besmirch a few good online names with smut. I guess this turn of events was obvious to anyone with half a brain. Legitimate porn sites have little interest in the triple X domains, which went on sale earlier this week, for their businesses because they see them as potential censorship and, more importantly, they thrive on people accidentally stumbling on their URLs. In the early days of the web this was common because porn purveyors snapped up known names and brands -- none of which had to feature an obvious porn domain label. That's how ""Whitehouse.com"" ended up, for a time, as a porn site. .XXX was designed to improve the situation. No more accidentally typing in, well, something you didn't intend. With a designated porn domain, it's unlikely anyone would end up in the wrong place. Better yet, corporations and homes could easily block all .XXX domains. That's the plan, but if pornographers stay away and legitimate people, companies, businesses and universities race to snap up any and all XXX domain names that could be construed as theirs, then this triple XXX domain could be an embarrassing failure for the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Think I'm exaggerating? The AP reports that 80,000 XXX domains were sold in presale and many companies like Pepsi and Nike lined up to purchase adult domains. The University of Kansas reportedly just paid $3,000 for a variety of XXX URLs. It's unlikely anyone will ever type in www.KUgirls.xxx, but that's not the point. The university just wanted to be safe. I understand the impulse. Even as I'm writing this, I'm wondering if I, too, should try to protect my good name by buying the LanceUlanoff.xxx domain. I know where to go. GoDaddy.com is registering them for $99 a year, making these domains considerably more expensive than standard domains (which you can buy at various sites at anywhere from $1.99 or $9.99 -- yearly maintenance fees are then more expensive). According to the website, if I wanted to launch an adult website under that URL, I actually have to become an ""Internet Community Member"" and then confirm my status of ""the sponsored adult entertainment community"". My guess is that this is how the ICANN polices the URLs, to ensure that someone isn't registering someone else's brand as a porn site. I have no plans to do so, which conveniently means I do not have to become a part of the ""Community."" GoDaddy tells me this too, and is -- fortunately, I guess -- only too happy to help me park my URL for the same exorbitant fee. Atop GoDaddy's XXX domain registration page is this: ""Let's be adult about it. Create an adult Web presence or protect your brand."" This is followed by an explanation of why you'd want to register an XXX domain. Note what it starts with: . ""Secure your brand. Protect your reputation."" ""Perhaps you'd like to create an adult entertainment website. Or maybe you're here to keep your brand from being registered as a .XXX by someone else. Whatever your reasons for wanting a .XXX domain, you've come to the right place. To check the availability of your domain, type the name you want into the search box above. "" GoDaddy has built its brand with coy references to sex (check out any of its Super Bowl ads), but it's not being coy here. The message is clear: If you don't want someone launching a porn XXX domain with your name or brand, you'd better let GoDaddy take your money and register it for you. While I see the parallels with the early days of the web, this situation is different in one fundamental way: Those snapping up the domains for protection will never use them. No one outside the porn industry wants to run a live XXX domain website. These businesses and universities are simply buying them in what GoDaddy actually calls ""Defensive Registrations"" to hide them from view forever (and they'll pay GoDaddy yearly fees to do so). Instead of creating a solution, the ICANN's apparently misguided efforts have spawned a new anxiety: ""Your Brand Name in Porn."" The fear is so strong that it's got all these people buying up domains just so the wrong people can't get them. As I see it, this could be quite a windfall for GoDaddy. The company should send the ICANN a thank-you note. See the original article at Mashable.com . Â© 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The National Basketball Association will proceed with a vote to force a sale of the Los Angeles Clippers, rebuffing an effort by co-owners Donald and Shelly Sterling to sell the franchise voluntarily, NBA spokesman Mike Bass said Friday. ""We continue to follow the process set forth in the NBA Constitution regarding termination of the current ownership interests in the Los Angeles Clippers and are proceeding toward a hearing on this matter on June 3,"" Bass said. His announcement followed reports earlier Friday about how Donald and Shelly Sterling agreed to a voluntary sale of the NBA franchise as the league prepares a vote on a forced sale, according to a source familiar with the situation. The couple have an agreement to allow Shelly Sterling to do the negotiations, and there have already been discussions between her and the NBA, according to the source. Attorneys for the Sterlings, who earlier declined to comment about the couple's effort for a voluntary sale, weren't immediately available to react to Bass' statement. The Clippers declined to comment on the NBA statements, spokesman Seth Burton said. Friday's events signal how the NBA is standing by its ultimatum that a vote will be held on a forcible sale. For their part, the Sterlings appear to be running out of options -- short of suing the league -- and analysts say such a lawsuit wouldn't be inconceivable, as Sterling is an attorney well versed in litigation. Meanwhile, pressure grows for Donald Sterling, a real estate billionaire. He faces a deadline Tuesday to respond to the NBA's proposal to terminate his ownership in the team because of racist remarks he made. The NBA has banned Donald Sterling for life, and the league is advancing a vote by other team owners that would force the couple to sell the franchise. The ban and pending vote -- along with a $2.5 million fine against Donald Sterling -- arise from how he slurred African-Americans. A voluntary sale would be a new maneuver for the Sterlings. Last week, Donald Sterling hired an antitrust lawyer to fight the NBA about the proposed forced sale. And his wife has said she wanted to keep an ownership stake in the team but doesn't want to be the controlling partner. The couple own the team through a trust. They are also estranged, Shelly Sterling's attorney has said. The NBA contends it was damaged by the 80-year-old's racist remarks to associate V. Stiviano, 31, that were captured on an audiotape and posted online in April by TMZ and in an interview with CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360ÃÂ°."" ""Among other things, Mr. Sterling disparaged African-Americans and 'minorities'; directed a female acquaintance not to associate publicly with African-Americans or to bring African-Americans to Clippers games; and criticized African-Americans for not supporting their communities,"" the NBA said in a recent statement. In order to terminate the Sterlings' franchise rights, three-fourths of the team owners (23 of 30) would have to vote to sustain the charge and force a sale. Because Sterling is banned from any NBA activities, he is not allowed to vote, but the Clippers will have a vote, the NBA said. Report: NBA says Donald Sterling asked V. Stiviano to lie .

"(CNN) -- Nearly a million acres were burning as 21 wildfires raged in the Pacific Northwest on Sunday, fire officials said. The unconfined fires in Oregon and Washington, mostly ignited by lightning from thunderstorms that swept through the region a week ago, covered 942,247 by Sunday, Northwest Interagency Coordination Center spokeswoman Carol Connolly said. The 21 large fires are the most the region has seen on the landscape at one time, she said. According to Okanogan County, Washington, Sheriff Frank Rogers, one person died attempting to protect his home from the flames. Authorities arrested two people over the weekend on suspicion of arson, the sheriff said. They set backfires to protect their property. More than 150 structures have been lost. The sheriff expects that number to go up. ""I've been here 30 years, never seen anything like this,"" Rogers said. According to Connolly, firefighters from across the United States, including Mississippi, Illinois, New Mexico, Utah and Montana, have joined the battle, bringing to 8,928 the number of people involved in trying to contain the fires. There are 35 ""hot shot"" crews involved, she said. Health officials in Washington and Idaho are warning residents that smoke drifting eastward from the Washington wildfires would create unhealthy air.

"(CNN) -- We have all been duped in the Trayvon Martin case. Bamboozled. This case was never ""open and shut"" as Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump insisted in a news conference at the start of the trial. I doubted it was that easy from Day One. Said Crump then: ""The jury will have to hear all of the evidence. We think this is a simple case. No. 1: Zimmerman was a grown man with a gun. No. 2: Trayvon was a child with no blood on his hands. Literally."" When I heard Crump's words, I was immediately suspicious. Could it really be that simple? Or was the attorney just trying to placate a grieving family and spin an angle for the media? Did Crump really believe that ""Justice for All"" had finally arrived in our nation? And that the damning stereotypes associated with race and class would have no room in a Florida courtroom where George Zimmerman is being charged with second-degree murder in the death of Martin? Get the latest updates at HLNTV.com's live blog . I'm no cynic but I am a realist. A realist who's covered enough criminal trials to know for certain that the trial that plays out in the public over pep rally vigils and celebrity protests is never the trial that unfolds in the courtroom. I understand that race still matters deeply in our courtrooms, just as it does in our nation. And there's no getting away from that fact. As the trial of Zimmerman continues, nothing is as simple as it seems. ""This case is a perfect storm,"" says Xavier Donaldson, a defense attorney and former prosecutor in New York. ""You have to look at the nature of the case and the racial, political and social economics of the defendant and accused. You have a young black kid, walking with a sweatshirt on and some guy, who wants to be a cop, assumes he's a criminal and shoots him dead."" Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. Trayvon Martin Shooting: Fast Facts . ""Zimmerman had an image in his community as a good guy, who wanted to protect people. So he -- and not Martin, the victim -- has gotten the benefit of presumption of innocence. Normally, in murder cases that doesn't happen. People generally believe that if you've been arrested and charged that you must have done something wrong, but those lines are blurred here,"" says Donaldson. It seems Zimmerman, in part because he belonged to his neighborhood watch group, has been granted the status of a police officer. He even has police officers testifying in his favor that Trayvon's father, Tracy Martin, told them that the voice screaming for help on the 911 call was ""not his son"" when he heard the tape for the first time. The father strongly denies he said those words to the police. Normally, the prosecutor in a high-profile murder case puts forth evidence to prove the defendant's guilt and aggressively goes after any notion that suggests that the victim is at fault. The prosecution's goal is to do anything it can to convince a jury that the killer is a menace that needs to be taken off the street. That's how the battle is won in the courtroom. But in the trial of Zimmerman, the prosecution -- Richard Mantei -- appears to be lying low and taking too many punches. Could it be that Mantei himself buys into the theory that Zimmerman is some misunderstood do-gooder in the community? It's just puzzling. Words matter, as we have seen over the course of the trial. So when Mantei told the court before resting his case: ""There are two people involved here. One of them is dead, and one of them is a liar,"" I was shocked. This is a murder case. One person is dead, and the other person is a murderer. Those words more accurately describe the facts presented in the case. There is no question that Zimmerman killed Martin, so there's no reason to tiptoe around the words. And that's exactly what is so troubling for myself and many others, especially in the black community. It has been all too easy an idea for people to entertain that Martin did something to cause his own murder. History tells us that in our nation's courtrooms and even outside of those walls, my son, your son, our sons still don't have the presumption of innocence, even when they are the victims of a murder. ""I would have told Martin's parents, 'prepare for hell,' "" says Donaldson. ""It will not be easy. They will present evidence that will make your son look like the worst criminal. The defenses' goal is to turn your son into the criminal here and make him guilty of the crime."" No one knows yet how this trial will end. Donaldson feels it's too close to call until rebuttals are made and the case wraps up. ""It could go either way,"" Donaldson says. But I do know one thing: We should not have to wear a Trayvon T-shirt to an awards show or attend a pep rally to remind America that when an unarmed child is confronted and gunned down in the street by a grown man who's trained to kill, that's murder.

"(CNN) -- After years spent fighting in some of the world's worst wars, former U.S. Navy SEAL Kristin Beck says she knows what she wants. ""I want to have my life,"" she told CNN's ""AC360."" ""I fought for 20 years for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I want some happiness."" Beck recently came out as transgender.

It chronicles her life as a young boy and man, known then as Chris Beck. Beck deployed 13 times, serving in places such as Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. She earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart along the way. Though she's felt trapped in the wrong body since grade school, Beck didn't come out until after she left the military in 2011. Doing so earlier would have been too big a risk. Transgender men and women are banned from service. ""That's a chance that if I took it, I might be dead today,"" she said. ""There's a lot of prejudice out there. There's been a lot of transgender people who are killed for prejudice, for hatred. When the book came out -- some amazing support and some amazing praises -- but also some pretty amazing bigotry and hatred."" Beck says she doesn't need people to love, or even like, her. ""But I don't want you to beat me up and kill me. You don't have to like me, I don't care. But please don't kill me."" 'No one ever met the real me' Beck explains her years of hiding as living like an onion. Deep down, under various layers, or skins, she hid her female persona. ""It is a constant, but as you suppress and as you bottle it up, it's not like on that surface,"" she said. ""You would never notice it because I can push it so deep, but then it does kinda, like, it gnaws at you. So it's always there."" Looking back, Beck believes she might have wanted to become a SEAL because they are ""the toughest of the tough."" She thought: ""I could totally make it go away if I could be at that top level. ... Maybe I could cure myself."" But the feeling of being born in the wrong body never went away. And for her entire career, Beck kept her mouth shut. She says virtually no one, out of the thousands of people she worked with, knew her secret -- it was so well hidden. ""No one ever met the real me,"" she said. Though her identity was hidden, the rest of what Beck offered was true. ""I gave true brotherhood.

"(CNN) -- Rebecca MacKinnon: We're losing control of our digital privacy . The erosion of privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment, written to protect us against unreasonable search and seizure, began in earnest under President George W. Bush. The Patriot Act, passed overwhelmingly but hastily after 9/11, allows the FBI to obtain telecommunication, financial, and credit records without a court order. Moreover, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act's 2008 amendment act grants U.S. companies immunity from being sued by their customers when they comply even with blatantly illegal government surveillance requests. As a presidential candidate in 2008, Barack Obama pledged to reform the Patriot Act and rescind the FISA Amendments Act, but as president he reversed his position. The Obama administration has fought bipartisan efforts in Congress to bring the change he once championed.

We can use an alias on Facebook. We can turn our cell phones off and spend cash. But increasingly, none of it matters. There are simply too many ways to be tracked. The Internet, e-mail, cell phones, web browsers, social networking sites, search engines: these have become necessities, and it's fanciful to expect people to simply refuse to use them just because they don't like the spying, especially since the full extent of such spying is deliberately hidden from us and there are few alternatives being marketed by companies that don't spy.

Amitai Etzioni: Despite Facebook, privacy is far from dead . If you read closely the various alarmist articles about the death of privacy, you soon will note that many deal either with public spaces or with hypotheticals. They claim that police could abuse these tools, might use them to ill effect and so on. The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, criticized the use of drones by law enforcement by arguing that such use ""could eventually eliminate the privacy Americans have traditionally enjoyed in their movements and activities."" Facebook has been caught in the same crossfire between strong privacy advocates and the social benefits it generates for hundred of millions who use it to communicate with their families and friends, close and not so close. It improved its privacy settings, though it still takes a considerable amount of effort to set them at the specific level one prefers. However, if Facebook users choose to ignore the risk to their privacy when they log in to this domain, which is known for its openness, their complaints must be taken with a grain of salt.

"Dongguan, China (CNN) -- The Chinese factory floor ain't what it used to be. Heavy industry machines now sit idle, where once hundreds of workers would have crammed into Dickensian sweat shops, slaving away for little pay. China's army of migrant workers are smarter than ever, demanding higher pay and better conditions, armed with tough government labor laws. Ben Schwall has ridden the wave of China's economic boom and now says the tide is turning. ""When I first came to China you had 200 people outside the factory gate trying to get in,"" he says. ""People would ask favors -- 'can you get my cousin a job?' Now that's gone and I'm asking -- 'do you have a cousin who can come help me?'"" Schwall is an old-style middle man. For two decades he's matched product-hungry Western companies with Chinese manufacturers. It worked for him, and it worked for the buyer and the supplier. But it also left him branded a traitor: an American helping China steal American jobs. It's a catch-cry that's making a comeback in this U.S. election year. Already anti-Chinese television commercials are playing to blue-collar fears. Schwall says it is nonsense. ""China's not taking these jobs, the jobs have left... the question is where are they landing?"" he says. Yes, it is true those jobs landed in their millions in China, transforming mid-sized towns into booming cities. China became the world's factory, running up breakneck economic growth. But Schwall says that was another era. ""Cheap China"" is finished. Increased costs, he says, are just part of the equation. The nature of work in China is changing; out with the old dirty factory jobs and in with cleaner high-tech industries. Yang Chunhong is feeling the brunt of these changes. He was once a factory worker himself. Now he is the boss and simply can't find enough staff. The orders keep coming, he says, but who will fill them? ""The lack of workers will definitely have an impact on my business. We turned down many orders from our clients because we don't have enough workers to make these products. It definitely has a huge impact,"" he says. While bosses may struggle, for now at least China's army of migrant workers is reaping the rewards. Hu Yalan, 23, came here to Guangdong in southern China from her home province two years ago. Her first job paid her RMB1700 a month, about $300. Now she wants double that and is scouring Guangdong's busy job market to upgrade. ""I think it's a matter of improving my ability,"" she says. There are big factories offering ""good salary"" and ""job training,"" she says. China is following a path chartered by the United States a generation ago. It is in transition. Old industries will fold as it enters a new era of higher paid, smarter work. Ironically, President Obama is leading the call for manufacturing to return stateside. It is seen as an answer to America's stubbornly high unemployment. Old China hands like Ben Schwall say, forget about it. ""The reality is jobs like this are not coming back to the U.S. It may be unpleasant, you may say I'm un-American but it is just the reality of it,"" he says. But with an election looming, that's not really a message U.S. politicians are keen to send to disenchanted voters. In meetings in Washington with China's presumptive President, Xi Jinping, President Obama has continued to raise his concerns about China's economic policies, what he argues is an artificially low currency and unfair export advantage. China's real challenge is to bridge the gap between the old and new industries, between the low paid and better paid, more demanding workers. If it fails the task, China may soon have its own political slogan: ""India is stealing Chinese jobs!""","One U.S. middle man in China says ""the jobs have left""

"Washington (CNN) -- Two commercial jets that nearly collided north of Hawaii last month were at altitudes assigned to them by air traffic controllers, the National Transportation Safety Board tells CNN. The cause of the near-disaster in the skies east of the Hawaiian Islands on April 25 is still under investigation. But a source with knowledge of the probe said the early focus is finding out why the planes were assigned to altitudes that put them dangerously close. The incident was brought to public attention when a passenger on one of the planes wrote a blog titled: ""Two Weeks Ago, I Almost Died in the Deadliest Plane Crash Ever."" In the incident, United Airlines Flight 1205, which was headed east to Los Angeles from Kona International Aiport on the Big Island of Hawaii, had to descend quickly to avoid a westbound US Airways jet, approximately 200 miles northeast of Kona. The United pilots received an audible warning that the plane was in danger from its traffic collision avoidance system, which monitors airspace around a plane. Both planes were Boeing 757s. Flight-tracking websites show the United plane descended 600 feet in 60 seconds. The passenger who wrote the blog post, Kevin Townsend, described feeling weightless as the United plane suddenly plunged. ""I felt my body float upwards and strain against my seatbelt,"" Townsend wrote. ""Passengers around me screamed. There was a loud crash in the back -- a coffeepot clattering to the floor and tumbling down the aisle. Our tray tables began rattling in unison as the 757 strained through the kind of maneuver meant more for a fighter jet."" Townsend estimated a total of 590 people were on the two planes -- based on the assumption that the other plane carried the same number of passengers and crew as the 295 people aboard his flight. Thus, according to Townsend, the death toll in a collision would have been the worst air disaster in history, surpassing the 583 who died in the 1977 runway collision of two Boeing 747s on a runway on the Spanish island of Tenerife. However, airlines officials this week declined to say how many people were on the two passenger jets in last month's incident. Townsend said he believes it was his report that led the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate. He said he wants to make sure near collisions are thoroughly investigated. ""I don't think there's some epidemic of near accidents that occurring, but it was a jarring experience dodging another plane,"" he said. An FAA official, speaking on background, said the agency began investigating immediately after the incident, and independent of Townsend's report. On Thursday, a joint FAA-NTSB team arrived at the Honolulu Control Facility to continue the investigation, the NTSB said. Commercial airline pilot Les Abend said the collision avoidance systems worked as designed. ""You're going to run into this situation, unfortunately. Nothing is perfect. I know that's not a comforting answer, but indeed the system worked,"" Abend told CNN. New video surfaces of teen stowaway jumping out of plane in Hawaii .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin will co-host NBC's ""Today"" show on Tuesday, according to Megan Kopf, a spokeswoman for NBC Universal. ""She'll reveal a different side of her than you've seen before,"" the morning show's website boasted Sunday. Last week ABC announced that former ""Today"" host Katie Couric will fill in for Robin Roberts as co-host of ""Today's"" rival morning show, ""Good Morning America,"" all week. Couric co-hosted ""Today"" for 15 years before leaving for CBS. The matchup of the two women brings to mind Couric's infamous 2008 interviews with Palin for CBS News when Palin was the GOP vice presidential candidate. Among the details revealed in the course of those interviews was the fact that candidate Palin could not name a single newspaper or magazine that she regularly read. Palin is now a paid contributor for the Fox News Channel. In addition to rekindling memories of 2008, the two announcements come at a big moment for the competing morning talk shows. According to Nielsen, ""Today"" has won the ratings war for some time, but recently ""Good Morning America"" has been making a steady comeback, threatening to overtake ""Today"" as the top-watched morning show.","Sarah Palin will co-host 'Today' on NBC on Tuesday .

"(EW.com) -- Holding off a nice run from ""22 Jump Street,"" the romantic comedy ""Think Like a Man Too"" took the top spot this weekend with a $30 million opening. That's great news for Kevin Hart, the gleeful star and narrator of the Steve Harvey-inspired ensemble piece, though early estimates predicted the sequel performing closer to the tune of $35 million. The sequel didn't match the original's 2012 opening weekend kitty of $33.6 million, but the laffer also cost a modest $24 million to make. Sony predicts a strong weekday play going forward, buoyed by Man's strong word-of-mouth and A- CinemaScore rating. There's a couple of great jokes in ""Think Like a Man Too"" where the lone square fella of the core Vegas bachelor party suggests the boys eschew a night of gambling and strip clubs and catch a performance of ""Jersey Boys"" instead. ""It won like eight Tonys!"" he says when the men recoil. Whether or not it was a pointed reference to ""Think Like a Man Too's"" fellow new release or not is unknown, but the Clint Eastwood adaptation of ""Jersey Boys"" hit a bit of a flat note in fourth place with $13.5 million. Going forward Broadway fans and older audiences may seek it out as a break from the jarring noise of superheroes and metal machines clashing angrily into each other. (Though I'm not sure Kevin Hart and his Vegas buddies would make that bet.) But with a budget of $40 million, ""Jersey Boys,"" which earned an impressive A- CinemaScore vote, still has some major singing to do for its supper. Meanwhile in its second week of release ""22 Jump Street"" nearly had its teeth in the No. 1 spot. The Channing Tatum/Jonah Hill buddy comedy took in $29 million this weekend, bringing its domestic grosses past $111 million. With a second-week drop of 49.8% in domestic markets, and a $14.1 million pickup in international territories, Sony executives should be bumping chests. Also holding strong is the parent-tested, kid-approved ""How to Train Your Dragon 2,"" which pulled in $25.3 million in its second week of release. All four aforementioned movies would do well to bow down to month-old ""Maleficent,"" the Angelina Jolie phenom that dropped just 29.7% this weekend with $13 million. The fairy queen will not go gentle into that good night. Here is how your top five shook out this weekend: . 1. Think Like a Man Too -- $30 million . 2. 22 Jump Street -- $29 million . 3.

"(CNN) -- The garden is overflowing with weeds and trash is riotously strewn across the lower floors. Upstairs, a makeshift curtain dangles by a string while an assortment of shelves and cupboards clutter the untidy space below. Not quite what you'd expect from a $1.1 million (Â£650,000) property -- but that's the price sought by the overseas owners of a house in London that until recently was the domain of illegal squatters. The three-bedroom home came on to the market in the Peckham area of the British capital last week and is described by estate agents as ""spacious"" and an ""exciting opportunity"" for potential buyers despite the obvious need for ""modernization."" Clearly, the owners are hoping to cash in on the city's red-hot property sector. But $1.1 million? ""Peckham as an area has witnessed a phenomenal uplift with property prices almost doubling in certain regions of the area,"" said Jason Morris, managing director of JT Clarke London, the estate agents in charge of selling the house when contacted by CNN. ""For example in November 2012, our company sold a three bedroom period mid-terraced, in need of some modernization but nothing too major, for Â£350,000."" ""Properties on that same street with an identical footprint are now currently on the market and achieving prices in the region of Â£650,000 ($1.1 million). This is not an isolated case but can be seen to be true of most properties within the locality regardless of style and size."" It's not just Peckham feeling the heat. Property prices in London increased by an average of 18.5% year on year in May according to the UK Land Registry, their fastest annual rise in 11 years. This stands in comparison to a rise of 6.5% across the rest of the UK, leading some experts to conclude that the capital's property market is overheating. Relatively low numbers of affordable new homes being built, generous government lending schemes designed to make deposits more affordable for first-time buyers and an influx of foreign investors plowing vast amounts into London's most salubrious districts have all played their part in the booming prices. While Peckham isn't traditionally one of the city's most exclusive neighborhoods, its favorable location, good transport links as well as its up-and-coming vibe has ensured its status as a desirable spot. Morris still believes there's more to come from the area given the underlying market conditions and high-demand for property -- although he cautions that other parts of London may soon start to cool off. ""Although prices have gone up in general, this is the one part of Peckham that has not yet peaked,"" he said. Even still, Morris acknowledged that it is highly unusual for owners to put their property on the market in such an unkempt manner. ""I would never advocate that any vendor puts their property on the market in such a condition unless they are open to offers that reflect the state and cost of remedial works,"" he said. ""(But) such is the strength of the market at the moment that there are many who will still purchase the property as is, demonstrating that property (and especially in London) is still the number one choice for many not only as a home but also as a sure investment.""","London property recently lived in by squatters on market for $1.1 million .

"(CNN) -- New York police have collected DNA evidence in the case of nighttime acrobats who replaced two American flags atop of the Brooklyn Bridge with two white flags, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation Friday. The swapped-out bleached flags were spotted by construction workers at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday. The DNA was taken from tin pans used by the vandals to cover bridge lights, according to the official -- a clever move to elude detection while the flags were raised. The tin shields were held in place with zip ties. So far there is no match in existing databases where DNA evidence of solved and unsolved crimes are kept, the official added. Among other leads investigators are following are five nicknames who tipsters suggest might be associated with the incident. Investigators are trying to learn the real identities behind the nicknames or street names. It's too soon to know whether any of them were involved, the official said. The motive is unclear: Was it a stunt, prank or something more sinister? Officials have said they are looking at whoever had access or familiarity with the bridge, including maintenance workers or anyone who worked on the fireworks extravaganza over the East River on Independence Day. The event this year included pyrotechnics shooting from the bridge. Cell phone calls are being tracked and about 18,000 license tags were checked from vehicles that crossed the bridge in the overnight hours, according to the official. More than 120,000 vehicles, 4,000 pedestrians and 3,100 bicyclists cross the Brooklyn Bridge every day, according to the city Department of Transportation, which maintains the bridge. The oversized white banners -- American flags that were pre-bleached -- have prompted investigators to talk with flag manufacturers and check websites for anyone who may have recently purchased large Stars and Stripes, according to the official. Intelligence analysts are also looking into any possible significance of the day that was chosen to see whether that may yield clues. The NYPD's Intelligence Division has even reached out to other countries to see whether similar stunts have occurred elsewhere. NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence John Miller said at a news conference Wednesday that the NYPD has video that shows four or five people crossing the bridge just after 3 a.m. Tuesday. Within the hour, the light that normally illuminates the flag on the Brooklyn side of the bridge flickered and appeared to go out. A few minutes later the same thing occurred on the tower on the Manhattan side. ""At this time, it appears it has no particular nexus to terrorism or even politics,"" Miller said Tuesday. ""This may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at making some kind of statement, but at this point it's not clear what the statement is."" Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called the incident a matter of concern and requested the help of the public as investigators search social media for claims of responsibility. ""If flying a white flag atop the Brooklyn Bridge is someone's idea of a joke, I'm not laughing,"" Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said in a statement. ""The public safety of our city is a paramount of importance, particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high-risk targets."" Adams announced that he is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to the arrest of the person or people responsible. The Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883. At the time it was the longest suspension bridge in the nation, according to the Department of Transportation. The bridge has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service, and a New York City Landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.

"(CNN) -- An outbreak of mumps, first reported at The Ohio State University, has spread beyond campus and into the community, health officials said. As of Monday, 63 cases of mumps were reported in Franklin County, Ohio, according to Columbus Public Health. Forty-five of those are linked to the university outbreak, said Jose Rodriguez, spokesman for the health department. ""The university cases have occurred in men and women between the ages of 18 and 48, while the community cases have occurred in residents of Columbus and Franklin County between the ages of 4 and 50,"" the department said in a statement. The first OSU cases were reported on February 11, Rodriguez said Monday. CNN Health Library: Learn more about mumps . The department is working with other universities to make sure they are ready to vaccinate members of the university community and promote infection control measures. The most important of those are: wash your hands, cover your cough and stay home if you're sick, he said. Mumps is ""a highly infectious disease"" that spreads the same way as a cold or flu does -- through respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes. Five days of isolation is required, ""and that can be complicated in a university setting,"" he said. Even more frightening -- one-third of cases have no symptoms, he said. The 63 cases are those who became ill; others may be spreading the disease unknowingly. OSU students went on spring break ""right as this was exploding,"" Rodriguez said, and local health officials contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to warn other departments to be on the lookout. ""The numbers doubled when the kids came back,"" he said. Cases of mumps were also reported at Fordham University in New York last month. Some 97% of those in the Ohio outbreak have been vaccinated, he said. The vaccine is 80% to 90% effective, meaning 10% to 20% of people who have been vaccinated might become ill anyway. Mumps typically begins with a fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite, which is followed by the swelling of salivary glands, according to the CDC. There is no specific treatment for mumps, and patients usually recover after a week or two, but occasionally the disease can cause serious complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, deafness or inflammation of the breasts or ovaries in girls who have reached puberty, the CDC said. Children should receive their first vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella at 12 to 15 months, and the second dose at 4 to 6 years, according to the CDC. Columbus Public Health is urging those at high risk -- including those who have not been vaccinated or those who only received one dose -- to get vaccinated. 2013: East Coast mumps outbreak linked to nightclub .","As of Monday, 63 mumps cases have been reported in one Ohio county .

"(CNN) -- It's been nearly two years since Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez was shot dead, but the Mexican teenager's family still doesn't know who pulled the trigger. Now his mother and the American Civil Liberties Union say the U.S. Border Patrol agents who they accuse of gunning him down must be brought to justice. In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday, they argue that the agents, who haven't been identified, used excessive force when they opened fire. Elena Rodriguez was 16 when he was found face-down in a pool of his own blood on the Mexican side of the border in October 2012. His family says there's only one way to describe the shooting: as a crime. ""We want to know the names. We want to know who they are. ... those who killed him, because they are criminals,"" grandmother Taide Elena said. In addition to demanding a jury trial, the lawsuit also seeks punitive damages and a declaration that the Border Patrol agents violated the Constitution. At the time of the shooting, the U.S. Border Patrol said agents in Nogales, Arizona, opened fire after people on the Mexican side hurled rocks their way. Tuesday's lawsuit, filed by the ACLU on behalf of Elena Rodriguez's mother, describes the 16-year-old as an innocent bystander, calling his killing ""brazen and lawless."" ""Just prior to the shooting, Jose Antonio was visible and not hiding; an observer could see that he did not pose a threat. He was doing nothing but peacefully walking down the street by himself when he was gunned down,"" the lawsuit says. ""He was not committing a crime, nor was he throwing rocks, using a weapon, or in any way threatening U.S. Border Patrol agents or anyone else."" An autopsy report from the state attorney general's office in Sonora, Mexico, last year said Elena Rodriguez was shot at least 10 times. Most of the bullets hit him in the back, according to the report. The teen, according to the lawsuit, was walking on a sidewalk along the border -- just a few blocks from his home in Nogales, Sonora -- when he was shot dead by the Border Patrol. Attorney Luis Parra told CNN the lawsuit is the family's only recourse. ""There is no other way in which the family can seek justice. There is no other alternative. ... What happened was an egregious act of violence and it should never happen again,"" he said. Border Patrol spokesman Andy Adame declined to comment to CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol on Tuesday, saying the agency does not comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit is the latest twist in a case that drew sharp condemnation from the Mexican Foreign Ministry and caught the attention of the United Nations' top human rights official. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the ACLU, said there's a key question with national importance at the heart of the case: ""Can a U.S. Border Patrol agent shoot into Mexico and kill a Mexican national and say that the U.S. Constitution doesn't protect you?"" Border Patrol: Smugglers spotted before shooting . Citing preliminary reports of the 2012 shooting, the Border Patrol said at the time that agents saw smugglers drop drugs on the U.S. side of the border in Nogales, Arizona, then return to Mexico. ""Subjects at the scene then began assaulting the agents with rocks,"" the Border Patrol said in a written statement at the time. ""After verbal commands from agents to cease were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm,"" the Border Patrol said. ""One of the subjects appeared to have been hit."" After the shooting, Mexico's Foreign Ministry argued that it was the latest in a series of cases that showed U.S. border patrol agents were unnecessarily -- and unjustly -- using deadly force. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in 2012 that the United States was using excessive force along the border. ""There have been very many, many, young people, teenagers, who have been killed at the border,"" Pillay said then, calling for a swift, transparent investigation. In May, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was changing its use of force policies, requiring more training and increased transparency. The Border Patrol has not released the results of its own investigation into the October 2012 case, nor the names of the agents involved. ACLU: U.S. agents have 'systemic problems of abuse' In addition to allegations about the October 2012 shooting, Tuesday's lawsuit also alleges that U.S. Border Patrol agents have ""systemic problems of abuse."" ""The Border Patrol consistently denies public access to basic information about its operations, including whether agents responsible for abuse are disciplined in any way, thus shielding the agency and individual agents from public accountability for abusive policies and practices,"" the lawsuit says. ""Even after many fatal shooting incidents involving Border Patrol agents, the agency has refused to release the names of those involved."" The lawsuit alleges that Border Patrol agents caused 46 deaths nationwide from 2005 to 2014, citing media reports and government data. A report by the Police Executive Research Forum released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in May said investigators had reviewed 25 cases from January 2010 to October 2012 that involved shots fired by Border Patrol agents who were attacked by rocks. The report did not provide details about the October 2012 incident. ""Some cases seemed to be a clear-cut self-defense reaction to close and serious rock threats or assaults, while other shootings were of more questionable justification,"" the report says. ""More questionable cases,"" according to the report, involved shootings that took place through the border fence ""at subjects who were throwing rocks at agents from Mexico.""

"(CNN) -- It's not the way most Americans spent Easter weekend, but then again, most Americans aren't Mitt Romney. And that's the potential problem that will be leveraged against him in the battle for the White House. The former Massachusetts governor and likely Republican presidential nominee spent the past few days with his family at his beach house in expensive and exclusive La Jolla, California. That's the same three-bedroom home, purchased for $12 million four years ago, that has made headlines over the past couple of years after reports of plans for a major remodeling and expansion. The home was in the media spotlight again just a few weeks ago, amid reports that the proposed renovations, which would quadruple the size of the structure, included an auto elevator for a four-car garage. Romney's GOP presidential campaign released a photo on Friday of Mitt and wife Ann Romney decorating Easter eggs with their grandchildren. On Sunday, Romney's son Matt tweeted out a photo of the family taking part in an Easter egg hunt on the expansive lawn belonging to their next-door neighbor. Also over the weekend, a photo of Romney walking across the beach, wearing a wetsuit and holding a boogie board, made its way onto the political blogs. A day later, in response, son Matt, who's seen in the beach picture with his father, tweeted ""water temp was low 60s. I was freezing in my full-length wetsuit. Guess my dad was just happy to be out there."" Are the photos much ado about nothing? Or are they an example of a candidate who might be tone-deaf to how most of the public actually lives. In 2004, opponents used images of then-Democratic presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts windsurfing to tag him an elitist, lumping in windsurfing with some of his other expensive pastimes, including skiing and flying himself between vacation homes. But boogie-boarding is not an expensive hobby, and a source close to the Romney campaign says it doesn't see a problem with the photos, and that like millions of other Americans, Romney spent the holiday weekend with his family. ""We had 11 of our grandkids staying with us and three of my boys and three of their, of course, their spouses,"" Romney said Monday, describing his weekend in an interview on former Arkansas governor and former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee's radio program. ""We had the Easter egg roll over the neighbor's lawn. He has a big lawn we use. We made Easter eggs, we went swimming and surfing in the water. We are in California. It is absolutely delightful."" Romney made millions at Bain Capital, the investment firm he founded in 1984, and at Bain and Company, a management firm he eventually ran. According to a financial disclosure form released by his campaign last year, Romney has assets totaling $190 million to $250 million in value. He made $42.7 million over the past two years and paid $6.2 million in taxes, according to tax documents released earlier this year by his campaign. Mitt and Anne Romney filed a joint 1040 reporting $21.7 million in 2010 income and $3 million in federal taxes. They also said their 2011 income was $21 million and the tax bill was $3.2 million. Besides the beach home in La Jolla, Romney owns a property along Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. He used to own a multimillion-dollar ski home in exclusive Deer Valley, Utah. The ""rich guy"" and ""Wall Street"" images were issues for Romney when he first ran for the GOP presidential nomination four years ago. This time around, Romney has been more casual, often shedding the suit for a less buttoned-up look. But he was attacked earlier in this primary season by rival Republican candidates, including Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, over his wealth. According to a CNN/ORC International poll released two weeks ago, Republicans nationwide said that Santorum cares more about average Americans than Romney by 47% to 34%. On the campaign trail, Romney talks bluntly about his financial status, saying, ""I've been very successful and I'm not going to apologize for that."" And GOP strategist Ana Navarro says the worst thing Romney can do is be insincere. ""The worst thing Romney can do is pretend to be what he's not. We all know he's a wealthy man. He's a successful man. He's made his money. He doesn't need to apologize about it and the best he can do is embrace it, accept it, and not be awkward about it,"" Navarro told CNN. ""It's part of a package deal and -- let's face it -- we live in America. In America, being successful and being wealthy is a good thing, not something we resent,"" she added. Another GOP strategist said Romney's success should be admired. ""The fact of the matter today, though, is that the American people are hurting. They're worried about their financial future, they're worried about their kids' financial future, and they look at Mitt Romney, who is a self-made guy and very successful, very successful over a number of different enterprises, and I think he's the kind of guy that the American people can look at and say we need this kind of success as a country,"" said Gentry Collins, who served as political director for both the Republican National Committee and the Republican Governors Association and who ran Romney's 2008 operations in Iowa, but who says he is neutral this cycle. Will photos of Romney on the beach, or at the La Jolla beach house, be used by the Democratic National Committee or the Obama re-election campaign? Stay tuned. But Democrats are already making an issue of Romney's wealth through his opposition to the so-called ""Buffett Rule,"" a push by the president and congressional Democrats to get those making more than $1 million a year to pay a higher percentage of their income in federal income and payroll taxes than those who make less. The bill is named for billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has argued that it's unfair that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. The measure would require that millionaires pay at least 30% of their income in taxes. The legislation is opposed by most Republicans, and the Obama re-election team is targeting Romney for his opposition. ""Romney supports tax policies that reward people like him, and now he's just trying to obscure just how much he would benefit,"" said Obama re-election campaign manager Jim Messina, in a conference call Monday. ""... Our message to Mitt is simple: If you don't have anything to hide, release your taxes just like every other candidate for president.""

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old Army private was arrested Thursday, one day after airport screeners allegedly found a small amount of C4 explosive in his checked luggage at Yuma, Arizona's International Airport. Officials said they found no evidence to suggesting he intended any harm with the explosives. According to an account from the U.S. attorney's office, Pfc. Christopher Eric Wey was attempting to board a United Airlines flight to Los Angeles on Wednesday when Transportation Security  Administration screeners detected the presence of explosives in Wey's luggage. TSA personnel subsequently found one-half ounce of C4 explosive hidden in a tobacco can inside one of Wey's bags, officials said. Wey was detained and interviewed by FBI agents. He has been charged with attempting to carry an explosive on an aircraft and transportation of a stolen explosive. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. A federal complaint filed by the Justice Department alleges that Wey stole the C4 while attending a recent explosive training course. Wey's attorney from the federal defender's office did not immediately return a call for comment. TSA Administrator John Pistole praised the work of the TSA officers involved in the case. ""At airports across the country, TSA employees are on the frontlines every day, working to mitigate threats and keep the traveling public safe,"" Pistole said in a statement.  ""With a concerted effort to identify and find explosives, this incident demonstrates the abilities of our highly trained officers and cutting-edge technology.""

"(CNN) -- Fernando Torres rediscovered his scoring touch as Spain soared to the top of Euro 2012 Group C and knocked the Republic of Ireland out of the tournament. The much-maligned striker, who spurned several chances in Spain's opening game against Italy, scored twice as the defending champions cruised to a 4-0 win in Gdansk. Strikes from David Silva and Cesc Fabregas helped to see off Giovanni Trapattoni's Ireland, who become the first team eliminated from Euro 2012. In Thursday's other game in Group C, Croatia fought back to hold Italy to a 1-1 draw. The Italians dominated the first half and evergreen playmaker Andrea Pirlo put his side in front with an exquisite free-kick. But in-form striker Mario Mandzukic, who scored twice in Croatia's first match, brought his tournament tally to three with an emphatic finish to earn a point. Spain 4-0 Ireland . Fernando Torres bagged a much-needed double as Spain thrashed the Republic of Ireland and cemented their status as Euro 2012 favorites. After being frustrated by Italy in their opening game, Vicente Del Bosque's world champions looked close to their best in a display that dazzled the Irish. Giovanni Trapattoni's side struggled to create a meaningful chance in the whole match and they limp out of the tournament following two defeats. Spain outclassed their opponents from the first whistle and led after four minutes when Torres skipped away from Richard Dunne's challenge and blasted high into the net. Goalkeeper Shay Given kept his side in it until halftime, making several saves as the Spanish controlled possession and created chances at will. But Ireland's dreams were extinguished shortly after the break when Given could only parry Andres Iniesta's strike straight to David Silva, who placed a remarkably cool finish past the keeper's despairing dive. But the night belonged to Torres, who was restored to the starting lineup as Spain ditched the unusual 4-6-0 formation employed against Italy. The Chelsea striker notched his second of the evening when Ireland carelessly lost the ball in midfield and Silva sent him through to tuck a calm finish past Given. The rout was complete when substitute Fabregas took advantage of more ponderous Ireland defending to lash a ferocious angled drive in off the post. Croatia 1-1 Italy . Mario Mandzukic's third goal of Euro 2012 secured a precious point for Croatia as Italy let a lead slip for the second successive time in the tournament. The elegant Italians controlled much of the game and lead though a superb free-kick from Andrea Pirlo but they were thwarted by Mandzukic's close-range strike 18 minutes from time. Cesare Prandelli's side will now go into their final Group C game against Ireland in desperate need of a win, while Croatia will feel they are one step closer to surviving the so-called ""Group of Death."" Despite another impressive showing from Italy following their much-heralded draw with Spain, they were left to rue a lack of cutting edge in attack. Flamboyant striker Mario Balotelli kept his place up front and looked dangerous, but he failed to convert the several half-chances that came his way before being substituted on 68 minutes. Italy's star performer was veteran midfielder Pirlo, who was at the heart of his side's fluent passing game and gave them a deserved lead on 33 minutes. After Balotelli has been fouled 22 yards from goal, Pirlo stepped up to curl a wonderful free-kick over the wall, beating Croatia goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa at his near post. The Italians looked in control but they had never previously beaten their Adriatic neighbors -- and the run continued thanks to Mandzukic's late leveler. When defender Giorgio Chiellini misjudged Ivan Rakitic's cross, Mandzukic took a brilliant touch and smashed the ball in off the post from six yards.","Fernando Torres scores twice in 4-0 victory for defending champions Spain .

"(CNN) -- Two Iranians were convicted in a Bangkok court Thursday over a botched bomb plot last year that resulted in one losing both of his legs as he hurled an explosive device while trying to escape arrest. Saied Moradi, 29, was found guilty of attempted murder, causing explosions and violating gun laws, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, Thai police spokesman Phanom Chuathong told CNN. Muhammad Khazaei, 43, was sentenced to 15 years jail for causing explosions and causing damage to public and private property. Israel has maintained the explosives were part of a plot aimed at assassinating Israeli diplomats in Bangkok Ã¢â¬â a claim Tehran has refuted. Both men -- who were charged with criminal rather than terrorism offenses -- denied any involvement in a plot, saying they were unaware of explosives in their home. The court also demanded the two men pay reparations valued at around 2 million baht ($62,300) to compensate for the damage caused. Thai authorities said five suspects escaped from a villa in the Thai capital following the blast, two of whom are still on the run. Moradi was injured when he detonated two bombs -- one when a taxi driver refused to give him a ride and another when he tried to throw a bomb at police officers as they closed in on him. The court heard that Khazaei ran out of the house after the first explosion and headed to the airport where police arrested him at the boarding gate. A third man, Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, managed to board a plane to Malaysia. Chuathong told CNN the court ruling would ""certainly have an impact on the High Court of Malaysia's decision on the extradition request from Bangkok."" Zadeh has been in custody in Malaysia since last year, pending a High Court decision on his extradition to Thailand. At the time of the blasts, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Iran is a threat to the stability of the world. They are targeting innocent diplomats. ""The international community has to denounce the Iranian actions and to indicate red lines concerning the Iranian aggression."" Ramin Mehmanparast, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, responded by condemning the blasts on Iran's state-run Press TV in an article on its website, but added: ""Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts.""","Iranians jailed over botched February 2012 bomb attack .

"(CNN) -- A Scottish court has convicted eight men of child sexual abuse in what police say is the largest pedophile ring ever dismantled in Scotland. The eight men were all convicted Thursday of offenses related to indecent photographs of children. Three were also convicted of the sexual abuse of young children, and five were convicted of conspiring to take part in the sexual abuse of a child, identified only as Child F. ""Tens of thousands of photographic and video images of children being sexually abused were recovered,"" said Morag McLaughlin, the prosecutor for the Lothian and Borders region. ""All of those involved in the investigation and prosecution of the case have been profoundly affected by it."" Two of the men, Neil Strachan and James Rennie, face a maximum of life in prison when they are sentenced July 29, said a spokesman for the High Court in Edinburgh, where the men were convicted. The others, who will be sentenced June 11, face a variety of lesser sentences. The police investigation revealed a network of people who shared a common interest in child sexual abuse, said Detective Superintendent Allan Jones, of Lothian and Borders Police. Information from the probe yielded information on 70 others around Britain and led to ""numerous arrests,"" he said. ""They made initial contact via the Internet and used it to share vile imagery and discuss the abuse of children,"" Jones said.  Watch a report on the convicted men Â» . Strachan was the only one of the eight who was previously known to police, he said. ""All of them led classic double lives. Some of them were respected members of their professions and communities,"" Jones said. The family of Child F released a statement after the conviction that detailed how Rennie betrayed the family's trust to abuse their son. Rennie was ""the closest of family friends"" for more than 15 years and even offered support and friendship during difficult times, they said. ""To subsequently learn that he abused our son, and invited others to do the same, has been devastating,"" the family said. ""As a family we have had to learn to live and cope with the effects these horrific events have had."" The mother of another child involved in the case, identified only as Child JL, described her ""anguish"" about what Strachan had done to her son. ""I will never be able to forgive him for the sick acts that he committed against my son,"" said the mother, whose name was not released. ""I feel that no matter what punishment given to Mr. Strachan, it will never be able to compensate for the hurt, devastation and great deal of stress brought to me and my family. Mr. Strachan used and abused our trust in order to satisfy his and others' sick needs."" Police and prosecutors gathered important evidence from overseas and used new scientific expertise in order to prosecute the case, the court said. Lothian and Borders Police said it received ""invaluable"" expertise from the FBI in the United States and other British and Scottish agencies -- including the Serious Organized Crime Agency and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Center. Microsoft helped police trace e-mail addresses and identities, Jones said. Police also had help from two U.S. academics, Professors Hany Farid of Dartmouth University and Miroslav Goljan of the State University of New York at Binghamton, who are experts in steganalysis, a forensic technique that links an image to the camera on which it has been taken, Jones said. Jones praised the forensic scientists who had to examine the imagery in the case. ""They do not have the option to look away and have to live with the memory of what they have seen,"" he said. ""It is a testament to their expertise that they did this day in, day out.

"(CNN) -- Donald Sterling can't seem to avoid trouble over recorded phone calls. In the latest twist to a downfall triggered by more recordings, the Los Angeles Clippers' owner allegedly threatened to ""take out"" his wife's lawyer and sue two doctors who declared him mentally unfit. He made several calls to the doctors this month and left profanity-laced voice mails to intimidate them out of testifying next month, according to attorneys for his wife, Shelly Sterling. ""I'm not incompetent. You're (expletive) incompetent, you stupid (expletive) doctor,"" he said in a June 9 voice mail provided by his wife's attorneys. 'How dare you' In the message, he identifies himself and expresses anger about the release of his medical records. ""There's an ethical issue here. ... How dare you give my records to a lawyer for the purpose of using it against me?"" he demands. ""You're nothing but a fraud and a liar and a cheat, and I'm going to see that you lose your license, and I'm suing you for conspiracy."" Sterling made the calls to two doctors, James Spar and Meril Platzer, who diagnosed him as mentally incapacitated. Both will present their evidence in court on behalf of Shelly Sterling, who's vying to uphold a negotiated sale of the Clippers. Death threat? His wife's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said Sterling targeted him as well and threatened to ""take you out."" ""I took that as a death threat,"" O'Donnell said. ""That hasn't happened in 40 years as a trial lawyer."" Donald Sterling waived doctor-patient confidentiality in connection with his mental evaluation, Shelly Sterling's attorneys said in court papers, an assertion denied by his lawyers. She asked a judge to order her husband and his legal team to stop contacting and harassing witnesses involved in the court battle. Los Angeles Judge Michael Levanas on Thursday rejected the wife's request to keep her husband and his lawyers away from witnesses, saying her assertions don't ""rise to the level of great and irreparable injury."" ""It is probably no surprise to anyone that this case might involve high emotions and some litigation posturing,"" the judge wrote. Deal to sell the team . Donald Sterling's attorneys admitted he left the voice mails, but they said he meant no harm and was just distressed that his medical records were publicized. The two physicians who examined Donald Sterling didn't have his permission to talk to third parties, said Bobby Samini, another attorney for Donald Sterling, . In next month's probate court trial, Shelly Sterling will ask the court to uphold her deal to sell the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion. Her decision to go to probate court follows a ruling by three physicians that her 80-year-old husband is mentally incapacitated and shows early Alzheimer's or other brain disease. The couple co-owns the basketball team. If one of the trustees is declared mentally incapacitated, the other becomes the lone trustee, according to records. His wife used that provision to negotiate the deal with Ballmer. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life and fined him $2.5 million after a different recording appeared in April in which he made a series of racist comments to a friend.","Sterling allegedly left intimidating voice mail messages for two doctors .

"(CNN) -- Moscow, Russia, authorities have cut the daily sales hours for beverages with more than 15 percent alcohol, making it illegal to buy such beverages in stores between 10 p.m. and 10 a.m., according to Russian state-run news agency RIA-Novosti. The move, which reduces by three hours a day the time those beverages can be sold in stores, will go into effect at the beginning of September, RIA-Novosti said. The tightened limits on alcohol sales also prohibit local prefectures from issuing 24-hour sales permits to shops. The cut in sales hours doesn't affect bars, restaurants or night clubs in Moscow, which can still obtain 24-hour liquor licenses and serve beer, wine or bottled cocktails with less than 15 percent alcohol. The move is part of a continued effort led by the Kremlin to reduce Russia's drinking problem. It is a problem that annually leads to thousands of deaths and a male life expectancy lower than anywhere else in Europe. The new law will only affect the Moscow region because there is no nationwide alcohol sales regulation, leaving alcohol available on store shelves 24 hours a day throughout the rest of the country, according to RIA-Novosti.","A new law in Moscow restricts alcohol sales in stores .

"(CNN) -- It's the biggest milestone yet for the aircraft affectionately known as the ""Queen of the Skies."" The 1,500th Boeing 747 has been delivered to German carrier Lufthansa -- a figure unsurpassed by any other wide-bodied plane. To celebrate, the plane was greeted with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and given a special logo in honor of its status. History of an icon . The revolutionary jet is beloved not only for its mammoth size and recognizable shape, but for the way it's influenced the aviation industry during a five-decade career. After debuting in 1969 at the Paris Air Show, it opened up air travel to millions of passengers previously unable to afford taking to the skies. Able to fly longer and carry twice as many passengers as its ancestor, the 707, the plane's arrival led to a drop in ticket prices and ushered in a new era of mass tourism. Tom Ballantyne, aviation journalist and chief correspondent at Orient Aviation magazine, said the 747 also heralded a new standard for in-flight comfort. ""And let's not forget the freighter version also changed the air cargo scene, allowing air transport to move large items and freight in bulk it had not been able to handle previously,"" he told CNN. The 747's milestone comes as the aviation market is shifting away from jumbo jets. Many airlines now prefer to run medium-sized twin-engine planes -- such as the Boeing 777 or Airbus A330 -- on more frequent timetables than operate four-engine double-decker jets. The smaller planes seat fewer passengers but cover the same distances and need less fuel. Japanese carrier ANA made headlines earlier this year when it retired its last two 747s for economic reasons, despite the airline's professed emotional ties to the aircraft. Biggest fan . Lufthansa remains one of the few champions of the new Intercontinental, as its newest incarnation, the 747-8, is known.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray left the Los Angeles County jail under sheriff's escort, avoiding reporters and Michael Jackson fans waiting for his release early Monday. Murray, who served two years of a four-year sentence for causing Michael Jackson's death, was driven away in a sheriff's car for the ""safety and security"" of the jail, sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The handful of Jackson fans gathered outside the jail accused the Los Angeles County sheriff of showing favoritism to Murray by slipping him out of the jail through a back exit, instead of the door where freed prisoners normally leave. Murray, who the sheriff's spokesman described as an exemplary inmate, was kept away from the general inmate population during his two years in the jail. He was also allowed to have liberal use of a telephone inside his cell during his last year. Murray's lawyer told reporters outside the jail that he would try to get his medical licenses reinstated in California, Texas and Nevada so he can resume the medical career interrupted by his conviction on the involuntary manslaughter in 2011. A jury concluded after a two-month trial that Murray's negligence led to Jackson's death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol. The cardiologist, who was hired to serve as the pop icon's personal doctor for his comeback tour in 2009, told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his intractable insomnia for two months so he could rest for rehearsals. Prosecutors argued that his negligence included leaving Jackson unmonitored and unattended while the powerful anesthetic was being pumped into his vein through an IV drip. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, arguing for the maximum four years in jail, said Murray was ""playing Russian roulette with Michael Jackson's life every single night,"" by using propofol to put him to sleep in ""a reckless, obscene manner."" Murray's lawyers unsuccessfully argued that Jackson self-administered the drug while Murray was out of his bedroom. He remained unremorseful during his two years in jail. ""My entire approach may not have been an orthodox approach, but my intentions were good,"" Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper interview last April. He said his intentions were to wean Jackson from propofol. He said he succeeded in eliminating propofol from his insomnia treatment three days before Jackson's death. ""I explained to Michael that this is an artificial way of considering sleep. It was basically sedation, minimal sedation,"" he told Cooper. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor imposed the maximum sentence on Murray, even though the doctor was technically eligible for probation. Pastor, in a 30-minute speech explaining his sentence, cited Murray's ""pattern of deceit and lies. That pattern was to assist Dr. Murray."" Jackson died ""not because of an isolated one-off occurrence or incident,"" Pastor said. ""He died because of a totality of circumstances which are directly attributable to Dr. Murray ... because of a series of decisions that Dr. Murray made."" Murray, he said, became involved in ""a cycle of horrible medicine.""

"(CNN) -- At least 137 people have died in the last few days from flooding caused by intense monsoon-season rains that have been lashing parts of Asia for weeks, according to government and media accounts. Pakistan's government reported Friday that up to a foot of rain (313 mm) in eastern parts of the country Thursday caused heavy flooding that left at least 56 people dead and 68 injured. That's up from 40 on Thursday, when the National Disaster Management Authority said many had died from collapsing roofs or electrocution by downed power lines. Thirteen of the deaths were in Lahore, one of Pakistan's most populous cities. News of the rising death toll in Pakistan came a day after reports out of Indian-administered Kashmir, where 50 people died when a bus carrying a wedding party overturned in a flash flood. They were among 70 killed in Jammu and Indian-administered Kashmir as a result of flooding, Indian officials reported according to CNN sister network CNN-IBN. In Thailand, the state-run MCOT news agency reported that authorities have urged residents along waterways in the country's central region to move to higher ground. The risk of flooding has increased there after a decision to release more water from a dam to reduce water levels in the flood-hit north, MCOT reported. The government had deployed more than 600 soldiers to aid in flood prevention work, the Bangkok Post reported. Emergency officials were concerned about the possibility of flash floods and mudslides, MCOT reported. On Wednesday, China's state-run CCTV reported 11 people had died and 39,000 had been evacuated in the southwestern city of Chongqing after heavy rains there. More than 2,200 homes collapsed in the deluge, CCTV said. Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal were also hard-hit in August.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- A day after officials announced the cancer diagnosis of Argentina's president, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez wondered Wednesday if the United States could be infecting the region's leaders with the illness. Five current or former Latin American presidents have battled cancer in the past few years, including Chavez himself, who claims to have beaten an unspecified cancer. Chavez prefaced his remarks at a military event in Caracas by saying, ""I don't want to make any reckless accusations,"" but the Venezuelan president said he was concerned by something he finds ""very, very, very strange."" ""Would it be strange if (the United States) had developed a technology to induce cancer, and for no one to know it?"" he asked. Chavez cited the revelation this year that the United States, between 1946 and 1948, had carried out human experiments in Guatemala where subjects were exposed to sexually transmitted diseases. That was 50 years ago, Chavez said, and he posited: Will it be discovered 50 years from now that the United States was infecting presidents with cancer? ""I don't know. I'm just putting the thought out there,"" Chavez said. Victoria Nuland, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman, told reporters Thursday that Chavez's assertion was ""horrific and reprehensible."" The Venezuelan president, who has a firm anti-U.S. stance, frequently hurls accusations at his political enemies, domestic and foreign. He has repeatedly said the United States is trying to destabilize his government. Documentary: Alleged cyberplot points to Venezuela and Iran .

New York is one of those places, Tokyo too, but there are only a handful of cities in the world that have that kind of energy. CNN: You used to be a DJ -- what's your opinion of Moscow's nightlife? CH: For some people the nightlife is the best in the world, but for me it's very commercial and posh. You can sum it up in one sentence, which is a general thing about Moscow: people here live ""Sex and the City."" They just want to go out and spend money and pretend they're rich and successful and live this dream. I recently had a conversation with the club editor of Timeout Moscow and I asked her if she thought the clubs were suffering right now with the economy. She said that in the modern ""New Russian"" culture people would rather sell their Mercedes than not go out and spend anywhere between $4,000 and $6,000 on a table in a club and admit that they're not rich anymore. Moscow is dominated by posh parties, but it's no different at a subculture place like a techno club -- you're always judged by the labels you wear, the car you drive and the music you identify yourself with. CNN: Where do you like to go in the city? CH: Novodevichy Monastery is a really beautiful old monastery. Stalin demolished a lot of churches and monasteries but this one was spared. There's a pond below it that you can walk around, and all the Russian Orthodox popes are buried in he cemetery. It's a very nice place. Another place is would be Vorobyovy Gory (Sparrow Hills), where you can look out over Moscow. It's pretty industrial looking but it has good views. I also enjoy the center of Moscow. I like hanging out on the roof bar of a hotel, having a drink, looking out over Red Square. It makes you feel like you're away from the noise of the city. What makes Moscow special to you? Let us know. CNN: What do Muscovites do at the weekend? CH: It depends on the time of year, but in the summer they take every opportunity to get out of the city. Everyone has a little weekend house called a ""dacha"" and every Friday night after work people leave the city. From 4pm in the afternoon to 10pm at night you have long traffic jams on all the roads out of the city. People will spend three or four hours in traffic jams just to travel 60km -- and on the way back on Sunday and Monday mornings it's the same. Some ""dachas"" are really basic wooden houses and some are palaces but every family has one, or even two or three. People go out to the woods or lakes and they have barbeques, they drink and they do some gardening. They value this ""dacha"" life so much that they're willing to spend 6 hours in traffic to spend 1 Â½ days in the woods. CNN: So is Moscow is deserted in the summertime? CH: Moscow is very quiet in the summertime -- it's my favorite time. You can already notice that there are less people in the clubs and less people in the streets at the weekend. Towards the end of June, Moscow is really empty. You really notice it from the middle of July until September, when it's school vacations. CNN: Has Moscow change a lot since you moved there? CH: Yes -- you can see it renewing itself. I know how it went with Berlin -- in 10 years you won't recognize Moscow anymore. Streets have changed so much in the last five years, in a good way and a bad way. A lot of cool-looking brick buildings were torn down to create business centers, but on the other hand you have great new modern buildings and hotels -- the Ritz Carlton for example. There are lots of new museums popping up, art centers, alternative art, new shops and cafes. It's so different to when I came here five years ago and to be honest, I never would have expected it. CNN: What do you miss about Moscow when you're away? CH: I miss the excitement. There's something going on all the time. There's so much choice in terms of theater, classical ballet, the nightlife, the galleries. You have that in Berlin but it's harder to find and not as exciting, and New York has lost a lot of its flavor, glamour and energy at the moment. CNN: If Moscow were a person, what would he or she be like? CH: An ugly princess who wears a lot of makeup and tries to be pretty! She would probably seem pretty rude, but inside she's a good person.","Chris Helmbrecht is a 37-year-old German who now lives in Moscow .

"(CNN) -- He seemed a little confused and unsure of his surroundings. Karl Kraus sat alone in a cell, his blue, watery eyes following me as I entered the holding area of a Chiang Mai courthouse. Karl Kraus is 90 years old, hard of hearing, frail and, according to the police, a dangerous pedophile. I'd wandered into the cells sure I would be rebuffed. Instead, the Second World War veteran seemed keen to talk to me. He explained how the allegations against him are motivated by greedy neighbors. He claimed they are trying to blackmail him. It's an argument he will make to judges in the coming weeks. Karl Kraus is thought to be the oldest person ever accused of child molestation in Thailand's over-burdened penal system. Last year, 2,888 people were charged with having sex with children under 15 in Thailand. Thailand has become the destination of choice for sex tourists looking to prey on children. But now the police are raising their game, determined to turn the tide. Police Lt. Col. Apichart Hattasin leads a small but very determined unit of officers in Chiang Mai, all dedicated to tracking down pedophiles. The workload is going up each month; officers here aren't sure whether that is because they are simply uncovering more cases, or whether more and more pedophiles are choosing to relocate to Thailand. But Col. Apichart is on a mission to catch them and that's not easy. He opened his files to CNN, showing us dozens of surveillance videos, photos and cases histories of suspected pedophiles. While he and his men may be convinced someone may be sexually molesting children, proving it in court is another matter. Often a case pivots on the testimonies of the young victims and that means defendants are often tempted to buy off families. ""Money can change a lot, it can change even the mind of the victims."" he said. ""The suspect might try to approach the victim or the family of the victims, to convince them or give bribery to make them change their statement. And if they change their statement, it could be different or totally different I would say. That is the most challenge."" And Col.Apichart is clear the law needs reform. ""There is no specific law about having child pornography in possession,"" he said. ""Thailand should issue the new law about child pornography specifically."" Ronnasit Proeksayajiva is with a small NGO called the Counter Human Trafficking Unit. He works closely with Col. Apichart, often accompanying officers on raids. His assessment is frank -- and bleak. ""Honestly right now I don't think it is getting better, I think it is getting worse, because I don't know, maybe they believe that Thailand is the best place for them to come to have sex with the children."" Karl Kraus is alleged to have lured girls into his modest rundown bungalow in Doi Saket near Chiang Mai. Just a few houses away, I met the mother of the four girls Karl Kraus is accused of abusing. She denied his claim that she is trying to extort money from him. Instead she breaks down and weeps as she goes into harrowing detail about the ordeal her daughters endured. The youngest girl Kraus is accused of abusing is just seven years old. Kraus' case has received media attention because of his age, but there are many thousands of other cases in Thailand, which largely go unreported. Like Swiss banker Cornel Wietlisbach, who pleaded guilty to abusing young boys in Chiang Mai -- he was facing a four year sentence, but this was halved because he cooperated with the police. In the end, he was granted parole immediately and was deported back to Switzerland after he'd paid a 4,000 baht fine (about $125). Such cases do little to discourage pedophiles from coming to Thailand. Col. Apichart says online forums are abuzz with talk about Thailand being a child molesters' paradise. ""There is a group of the pedophiles online, it is a community, they talk with each other and they like to come to a third world country where the criminal justice system is not strong enough to deal with them."" Another case working its way through the penal system is that of Robert Cutler, a U.S. Fulbright Scholar teaching biology at a Chiang Mai University. The police accuse him of sexually abusing young boys, something Cutler denies. Col. Apichart had him under surveillance for weeks. The photos show Cutler talking to groups of young boys on the street and taking other boys swimming at a local pool. A video of a police search of his apartment revealed semi-clothed youths in his bedroom. All this will form part of the case against him, which is due to start later this month. Col. Apichart has this message to pedophiles thinking of coming to Thailand: ""I would welcome them to come here, I'm looking for them and if they think they can escape let's try. I will get them one way or another. I will make sure they get punished.""","Last year, 2,888 people were charged with having sex with children under 15 in Thailand .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A teenage boy has become the focal point of growing public anger in China at the bratty behavior of children from privileged backgrounds. Last week, the son of an army general and celebrity singer in China rear-ended a Buick sedan carrying a family of three. It turned out that Li Tianyi 15, was driving his BMW without a license, according to the Beijing Evening News. After the collision, Li and an 18-year-old friend, who was driving an Audi behind him, reportedly jumped out of their cars and attacked the driver and his wife, berating them for stopping abruptly. As the couple's child cried in the back seat, the newspaper described how Li had threatened bystanders, daring them to call the police. The husband was taken to hospital after sustaining injuries to his head and ribs. Li had previously racked up 36 traffic violations while driving without license, according to media reports. Beijing's Public Security Bureau told CNN that Li has since been sent to a juvenile detention center for a year. The teenager grew up in an elite family, his parents both singers who frequently appear on stage and on television. His father, Li Shuangjiang, has long been a household name in China, best known for his renditions of patriotic military songs. After the incident, Li issued a public apology for spoiling his son and asked that he be given another chance, CCTV reported. However, this failed to stop the tide of public anger. Many voiced their anger on Sina Weibo, China's popular micro-blogging site. ""We will give him another chance, but the law can't."" posted @ Gujingyema. ""For kids with family and social connections, the only way to deal with this kind of kid is to go by laws."" @Sisirukou2265 observed: ""Nowadays, you are special if you have a special dad."" This is not the first time the children of the rich and famous in China have triggered public outrage. In October last year, a young drunk-driver hit two students on a university campus, killing one and injuring the other. According to Chinese media reports, the driver exclaimed ""My dad is Li Gang!"" as he tried to warn away security guards who tried to detain him. Li Gang is a senior policeman in Hebei province. Though the young driver was later sentenced to six years in prison, many people complained the punishment was too lenient. ""How can this be right?"" said @kakayazai on Sina Weibo. ""He deserves life in prison!"" @LeewuzhiV commented: ""Li Qiming (the driver) only sentenced 6 years in prison. I was taught since kindergarten that one life pays for one life. This case shows money can do everything."" Many in China speak of ""taizidang,"" or ""princelings,"" when referring to the children of high-ranking officials and rich families. According to one blogger, more and more people feel a sense of injustice when they hear about these children breaking laws and getting away with infractions by using their family's connections. ""Public anger rages whenever there are negative reports involving the off-spring of high-ranking officials and wealthy families,"" said Liu Yiming. He added that only by exposing their crimes would the situation improve in China.","Son of general reportedly attacked couple during road-rage incident last week .

"London (CNN) -- Jimmy Savile was once one of the most beloved people in Britain, a radio DJ and television star with big hair, a big cigar and an even bigger attitude. But since he died in 2011, Savile has become one of the most reviled figures in the country as it becomes clear that he sexually abused untold numbers of people over decades -- many of them children, hospital patients or mentally handicapped.

"(Careerbuilder.com) -- To most Americans, David Beckham is a soccer superstar. But to the rest of the world, he's pretty much an average professional footballer -- at least in terms of salary. Beckham's nearly $6.5 million annual contract doesn't even crack the list of the top 20 highest-paid soccer stars, and barely puts him onto the list of the top 50 earners in the sport. Soccer versus American football salaries . Although top athletes in neither sport are lacking in terms of base pay, the salaries of NFL players surpass those of professional soccer players. For the NFL's 2009-2010 season, average salary for the top five highest-paid players (not including endorsement deals) was $20.32 million. For the top five footballers, salaries averaged $14.67 million. In honor of the World Cup, here's a look at the paychecks that go with being a star of the world's favorite sport. The top 5 . 1. Coming in at No. 1 is 25-year-old Portuguese player Cristiano Ronaldo, who earns $17.06 million* per year as a forward for Spanish football club Real Madrid. Ronaldo, who also captains the Portuguese national team, is the most expensive soccer player in history. Real Madrid bought him from English club Manchester United in 2009 for a cool $132 million. 2. Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic comes in at No. 2, earning a reported $15.7 million for the 2009-2010 season. The 29-year-old striker plays for Barcelona and the Swedish national team. Until Ronaldo's Real Madrid deal was inked in 2009, Ibrahimovic was soccer's highest-paid player. 3. At 22, Lionel Messi is the youngest player to make the top 20 list of highest-paid soccer stars. Messi's 2009-2010 contract is worth $13.74 million. Messi, a striker for Spanish champions Barcelona, will represent his home country, Argentina, at this year's World Cup. 4. Samuel Eto'o is the captain of Cameroon's national team and a member of Italy's Inter Milan club, the European champions. The striker was part of the team that won the 2000 Summer Olympics and will participate in his third World Cup tournament this year. His experience has paid off; his current contract is worth $13.74 million. 5. Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, more commonly known as Kaka to fans, rounds out the top five. Kaka, 27, hails from Brazil and will make $13.13 million as a midfielder for Real Madrid this year. Before teammate Ronaldo's Real Madrid deal, Kaka also spent time at the top of the highest-paid players list. The rest of the top 20 . 6.

"(CNN) -- Pulling Ukraine closer than ever militarily to NATO, the embattled nation's president affirmed Thursday his desire to combat ""Russian aggression"" while expressing cautious optimism that peace, even if it's temporary, could soon be in reach. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko spoke from the NATO summit in Wales about new steps strengthening his country's security partnership with the European-North American alliance following months of fighting against what he claims are Russian-backed -- despite Moscow's denials -- rebels. This fighting has gone on for months in spite of rhetoric preaching peace from all sides and a host of diplomatic initiatives, the next of which is a meeting Friday in Belarus' capital that will include representatives from Ukraine, the rebels and Russia. ""As president of Ukraine, (I am) ready to do my best to stop the war,"" Poroshenko said. ""And ... I have, I can say, a careful optimism for tomorrow's meeting ... in Minsk because beforehand (Russian and rebel leaders said) they are ready for an immediate ceasefire."" Standing alongside Poroshenko, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that ""the best way forward would be to find a political solution."" But he expressed reservations that Moscow's latest public comments on its desire for peace will be an different than its past ones, after which the violence has ratcheted up rather than slowing down. ""What counts is what is actually happening on the ground,"" said Rasmussen, who accused Russia of having thousands of troops inside Ukraine who have fired on Ukrainian military positions. ""Previously, we have seen similar statements and initiatives. And they have actually just been smokescreens for continued Russian destabilization."" Rebels: Open to ceasefire with 'a political settlement' Rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions said in a joint statement Thursday that they would be prepared to order a ceasefire as of 3 p.m. Friday ""if agreements are achieved and Ukrainian officials sign a plan for a political settlement of the conflict."" These heads of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics will take part in talks in Belarus on Friday, the statement said, when they will present their proposals on ensuring compliance with the plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently presented a seven-point road map to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, though that plan was quickly dismissed by Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a rescue plan for pro-Moscow rebels. Putin and other Kremlin officials have voiced sympathy for separatists, many of whom are ethnic Russians, while harshly criticizing the Kiev-based government for what they say is a heavy-handed military assault that's killed innocent civilians and contributed to a humanitarian crisis that's affected many others. But they say they haven't sent Russian troops into the war-torn region in eastern Ukraine -- a claim that Poroshenko, Rasmussen and their allies aren't buying. The United States believes Russia now has three to five ""battalion task groups"" conducting military operations inside Ukraine, according to two U.S. military officials. Each group can have as many as a thousand troops. Many more Russian troops control the border with Ukraine for thousands of miles -- from Rostov to Donetsk, the U.S. officials say. NATO offers funding, military assistance to Ukraine . The reported incursion into Ukraine, and the threat that Russian forces could move even deeper into the country and perhaps into neighboring ones, has caught the attention of many in the West. ""This is the first time since the end of World War II that one European country has tried to grab another's territory by force,"" said Rasmussen. ""Europe must not turn away from the rule of law to the rule of the strongest."" To curb this push, NATO isn't sending troops to the front lines in Ukraine, but it is bolstering its partnership with the Kiev government. That includes a focus on improving the Ukrainian military's cyber-defense, logistics and command and control capabilities, as well nearly $20 million in NATO funding for Ukraine on top of other monetary contributions from its member states, Rasmussen said. Furthermore, Poroshenko said there's a push to achieve ""full interoperability between Ukraine and NATO"" plus systemic reforms that could lead to Ukraine some day formally joining the alliance. That would be significant because all NATO forces are obliged, per the terms of the alliance, to come to the defense of any other NATO member country that's been invaded. ""A friend in need is a friend indeed,"" Poroshenko said. ""And (what NATO countries have done so far) was a very strong demonstration of solidarity with Ukraine."" President: 'Ukraine ... pays the highest price, every single day' While the sides offer divergent views about who is involved and who is to blame, there's no doubt the violence -- for now, at least -- is in full swing. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters Thursday that Russia continues to fly reconnaissance drones over its territory and shell Ukrainian military positions. In the town of Debaltsevo, for instance, Ukrainian troops are being shelled and are nearly surrounded, Lysenko said from Kiev. A CNN team in Mariupol saw a large plume of smoke from artillery fire less than three miles from the main Ukrainian checkpoint heading out of the southeastern port city toward the border town of Novoazovsk, which Kiev said last week was seized by Russian troops. Another CNN staffer with a Ukrainian spotter unit about six miles east of Mariupol witnessed sustained artillery bombardment of the area, with firing on a wide front and coming from the Russian border area. This indicates that the rebel positions are now are much closer to the city than they were previously. Poroshenko said ending the conflict -- which since mid-April has cost the lives of about 840 Ukrainian troops, with over 3,000 more injured -- will require Russia to pull back its troops from Ukraine and from the border. ""Ukraine (is the) object of the aggression, and we have have to do our best (to) immediately stop the aggression,"" the President said. ""Why? Because it is exactly Ukraine that pays the highest price, every single day."" CNN's Nic Robertson, Diana Magnay, Tim Lister, Jason Hanna and Barbara Starr, as well as journalist Victoria Butenko, contributed to this report.","Ukraine's president meets with the heads of NATO countries in Wales .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of killing a migrant from Kyrgyzstan and leading recent riots that drew thousands in Moscow has been arrested, state media reported. Ilya Kubrakov and three other rioters were arrested on Friday, a Moscow court announced, according to the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti. Kubrakov could face life in prison for the stabbing death of the Kyrgyz migrant in southern Moscow, whose body was found on Sunday, RIA Novosti said. On December 11, about 5,000 nationalists and ""football hooligans"" clashed with Moscow police as an unsanctioned nationalist-tinged mass memorial for a fellow supporter turned violent, according to state media. The fans were protesting alleged police negligence over the death of Yegor Sviridov, 28, who was killed in a fight with migrants from Russia's North Caucasus region, according to RIA Novosti. The confrontations took place in Manezh Square, outside the Kremlin, and led to the arrests of 65 Spartak Moscow fans for ""disobedience,"" Moscow police spokesman Viktor Biryukov said last weekend, according to the official Russian news agency Itar-Tass. The head of the Spartak Moscow fan club has told RIA Novosti that the showdown had nothing to do with sports but instead was rooted in problems in Russian society. More disturbances followed on Wednesday, when ethnic Russians and internal migrants met for a confrontation in Moscow, and other riots have also taken place in St. Petersburg and other Russian cities, RIA Novosti said. According to the news agency, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev blamed the rash of race-hate violence on investigators who released suspects in Sviridov's death. Medvedev called on authorities to take measures to punish those responsible for the crime, RIA Novosti said.

"(CNN) -- Singapore's first public housing blocks built to be environmentally sustainable have become the testing ground for future projects. From afar, the high-rises of Punggol Eco-Town look unremarkable, but they are the first large-scale experiment to make public housing eco-friendly in Singapore, a tropical city-state that is hot year-round. Over 80% of Singapore's residents live in public housing, called HDBs, after the government agency that builds them. ""What we have done is that we put in various eco friendly features that helps in terms of capitalizing on the wind, enhancing greenery, reducing energy consumption, water usage, how to promote waste recycling, et cetera, all in one development,"" said Ng Bingrong, the project director, Treelodge@Punggol. The eco-friendly methods range from commonplace and practical to highly innovative. Plant-covered roofs naturally lower the buildings' temperature, and the towers' orientation, facing away from the sun, helps too. Painting the buildings white helps keep them cool and bring in sunlight. But white walls also look dirty more quickly, so the government is testing self-cleaning paint, which breaks down grime as it is triggered by sun exposure. Alan Tan, the director of HDB's Environment Sustainability Research team says the project's variety of experiments will have wider implications for future housing in Singapore. ""Punggol Eco-Town is in fact a living laboratory for us,"" said Tan. ""This is where we test bed a lot of urban solutions for us to identify which of those are workable and for us to adopt, for us to introduce more to our public housing,"" Inside the apartments, tap water that goes down the drain is used to flush toilets. Solar energy powers elevators, lighting and water pumps. And various indicators placed around the buildings, like the ones found in the elevators that show the amount of solar energy being outputted, provide constant reminders to the residents of the different lifestyle they are living. But being eco-friendly comes at a higher price -- the sustainable buildings cost 7% more to build than traditional apartments. The cost concerns have also sparked fiscal innovation, pushing the government to think of ways to make the eco-friendly features less expensive. One solution has been to lease, instead of buy, the building's solar panels from private companies. ""It's very difficult for the government to continuously provide the funding. So what we have done is that we will try to partner with the private industry,"" said Ng. Under the scheme, the government subsidizes start-up costs, while the solar energy companies install the panels, maintain them and sell back the energy to the power providers to recoup their costs.","Punggol Eco-Town is Singapore's first large-scale experiment to make public housing eco-friendly .

"(CNN) -- Police have released more than 60 soccer fans detained Saturday in downtown Moscow riots that injured 29 people, an interior department spokesman said Sunday, according to state-run media. Hundreds of soccer fans clashed with Moscow police as an unsanctioned nationalist-tinged mass memorial for a fellow supporter turned violent, according to state media. The confrontations took place in Manezh Square, outside the Kremlin, and led to the arrests of 65 Spartak Moscow fans for ""disobedience,"" Moscow police spokesman Viktor Biryukov said, according to official Russian news agency Itar-Tass. An undetermined number of people -- including several police -- were hurt in the clashes, news agencies reported. Russian football has been in the spotlight since the country was named as the host of the 2018 World Cup finals earlier this month. The head of the Spartak Moscow fan club told the semi-official news agency RIA Novosti that the showdown had nothing to do with sports but instead was rooted in problems in Russian society. Nationalist group members stirred the clashes, Russian Football Union president Sergei Fursenko told the news agency. Some 5,000 fans of the Moscow soccer club had gathered to remember a fellow fan, Yegor Sviridov, who was killed December 6 in northern Moscow by several men from Russia's Caucasus region. Police blocked their rally, but fans then started a fight with men from Caucasus, reported Itar-Tass. Hundreds of fans chanted nationalist slogans, with some throwing flares and smoke pellets at police. Video on the independent Russia 24 network showed helmeted police officers clubbing protesters and dragging them away. Anti-riot police used batons to try to break up the gathering and help facilitate traffic through the area, according to Itar-Tass. Some fights broke out, and several police officers were injured. Moscow police chief Vladimir Kolokoltsev used a megaphone to urge the crowd to disperse, saying, ""You have let (your) steam out. Now you'd better go home,"" reported Itar-Tass. Kolokoltsev later credited Interior Ministry official Yuri Demidov for giving ""exhaustive answers"" to fans' questions and calming them down. Still, according to Itar-Tass, about 300 supporters ""crushed everything"" on their way from the square to the subway, breaking lights on escalators and smashing windows on a train. Kolokoltsev said that he was confident that all those involved in the December 6 confrontation in northern Moscow would be arrested.

"(CNN) -- The Archdiocese of Philadelphia barred two more priests from ministry on Friday amid allegations of child sexual abuse, bringing the tally to nine clergymen banned from the embattled church since May. Archbishop Charles Chaput said Rev. John Bowe, 64, and Rev. David Givey, 68, did not sexually abuse minors, but violated what the church defines as the ""boundaries of appropriate behavior in all interactions with children and young people."" ""We're not commenting on specifics for what could be a variety of reasons,"" said archdiocese spokesman Kenneth A. Gavin, who declined to elaborate. Connecticut priest charged with possession of child porn . Bowe and Givey, who both have served as clergymen for nearly four decades, have the right to an appeal. They could not be immediately reached for comment Friday. The announcement leaves 12 pending cases of the 26 Philadelphia priests suspended following a February 2011 grand jury investigation into the archdiocese's handling of child sex abuse allegations. The report determined that at least 37 priests had been permitted to keep working ""despite reports that they have engaged in improper behavior with minors."" In May, five priests were barred from ministry following a church investigation into accusations of child sex abuse. Less than three weeks later and in a separate probe, two others were barred due to allegations of sexual abuse of minors. With nearly 1.5 million members, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia is one of the largest in the nation. Friday's announcement comes exactly two weeks after Monsignor William Lynn was convicted of child endangerment in the landmark case. The jury was unable to bring a verdict against his co-defendant, the Rev. James Brennan, who was charged with attempted rape of a 14-year-old altar boy and endangering the welfare of a child. Defrocked priest Edward Avery was due to also go on trial with Brennan and Lynn, but pleaded guilty in March to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse after admitting to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-99 school year at St. Jerome Parish.

"(CNN) -- Suddenly, Europe is talking about growth and not just austerity. The French and the Greeks have followed voters in a series of other European countries in rejecting a pro-austerity government. The Greeks just denied their ruling parties a majority vote in the parliamentary elections, throwing into question the country's commitment to structural and fiscal reform. And the French elected Francois Hollande, who will be France's first Socialist president in 17 years. America has a large stake in European prosperity. Twenty-two percent of U.S. exports are sent to Europe and the two economies are stitched together with cross-border investments, interdependent capital markets and a shared view of global economic governance. Our mutual dependence has grown to the point that when either economy catches cold the other one risks more than a mild sniffle. The European elections add a degree of uncertainty for American companies thinking about investing in slow growth economies. But the impact is likely to be short-lived. As Europe goes through the process of finding a way to combine some growth with long-term deficit reduction, U.S. exports are likely to suffer. As expected, the Hollande victory and the political upheaval in Greece triggered strong reaction from markets around the world. European banks that have been harboring reserves are likely to be even more cautious going forward. And again, there is talk of Greece having to leave the eurozone. But for some time now, calls for growth have been heard from Ireland to Italy. The Dutch government suffered recently as it failed to heed calls for policies to foster growth. The new emphasis on growth reflects both a political and economic necessity. Greece has already plunged into high rates of unemployment. In Spain, the overall unemployment rate is approaching 25%. Almost half of younger Spaniards are out of work. Adding austerity to the mix is simply politically unsustainable in mature democracies, as the election results in France and Greece demonstrate. Moreover, short-term austerity policy does not revive economic growth. Just take a look at Britain. There, the fiscal deficits have grown rather than shrink. The French government will be looked over carefully by international investors. If France was to adopt short-term tax cuts or increases in spending, it will likely be met by investors demanding higher interest rates on government bonds, which would constrain the government in its ability to promote growth. If France pursues a stimulus package, investors will want to see not only how much money is spent but also how the money is spent. For example, investments in infrastructure, technical education and scientific research should produce very different results than traditional policies of tax cuts and added unemployment compensation. What the struggling European countries should really do is learn some lessons from Germany, which has extended the retirement age, made adjustments to the social safety net and kept a tight rein on fiscal deficits. But it's not easy to emulate the Germans. As France and its neighbors craft out new policies, slow growth in Europe will reduce some pressure on global commodity markets, particularly oil. That could be a plus for the United States. But, a decline in U.S. exports to Europe will drag down an already anemic job market at home. Economic and financial trouble in Europe is not good for the American economy. Neither is the political turmoil caused by too much austerity imposed too quickly. Traders will do well with a period of volatility caused by the changes in governments. Longer-term investors in Europe or the United States will be fine as long as they keep their eyes on economic and corporate fundamentals. The leaders of France and Germany are expected to meet next week, shortly after Hollande takes office. They have every reason to pursue reasonable policies that will benefit everyone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kent H. Hughes.","French and Greeks reject their pro-austerity governments in elections .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Federal authorities announced Tuesday they dismantled an international child pornography ring that allowed its 35 male members to trade thousands of images and videos of boys in sexually explicit situations through a website. The announcement was made in the wake of Monday's guilty plea by a Georgia man to transporting child pornography using a secret Internet bulletin board called ""Lost Boy."" That website operated from September 2007 to January 2009, when authorities shut it down and began investigating the men who operated it, officials said. ""After a two-year investigation, we believe we have pursued all avenues, and our comments won't jeopardize the investigation,"" said Andre Birotte Jr., the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, where authorities first discovered the existence of the global child porn ring. ""We felt this was the right time to come forward,"" Birotte added. ""We are not talking about innocuous photographs.... I'm talking about serious graphic images of boys being sexually exploited."" David Michael Fagerness, 44, pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to conspiracy to transport child pornography, officials said. Fagerness, whom authorities said was from the Atlanta area, had relocated to the Czech Republic after being convicted of possessing child pornography in a Florida state court in 2005, but the Czech Republic ordered his return to the United States to face the federal charges, officials said. Fagerness now faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence, and his sentencing is scheduled for June 6, 2011, prosecutors said. Another alleged ring member, who was a registered sex offender, even used public library computers to access the Lost Boy website, but James Criscione, a 53-year-old Los Angeles attorney, died in custody earlier this year while facing charges, authorities said. In all, 16 of the shuttered website's 35 male members have been charged in the United States for their roles in the ring, and five of them have entered guilty pleas, with two more expected to plead guilty later this month, authorities said. Eight of the defendants face federal charges of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, which carries a mandatory 20-year sentence, officials said. Four more defendants are named in an indictment but remain in Belgium, New Zealand, Germany and France, authorities said. The remaining men in the child pornography ring are being sought, but in many cases, authorities have only their screen names and not their identities, officials said. The investigation has also led to the identification of 27 victims of child abuse in the United States, including some whose images were posted on the Lost Boy bulletin board, officials said. Authorities discovered the Lost Boy website after Eurojust, the judicial cooperation arm of the European Union, provided U.S. officials with leads from Norwegian and Italian authorities indicating that a man in North Hollywood, California, was communicating with an Italian national about child pornography and how to engage in child sex tourism in Romania, officials said. Authorities found that the Lost Boy bulletin board had 35 adult male members, 15 of whom were U.S. nationals, officials said. Home countries of other members also included Brazil and Canada, officials said. ""Through unprecedented cooperation with foreign law enforcement partners, we have brought down a global online group whose principal purpose was to victimize children,"" said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. The network had a vetting process for new members, most of whom had to post child pornography to join the organization, officials said. Once accepted, members had to post child pornography to remain in good standing and not be removed from the board, officials said. Members traded techniques to evade detection by law enforcement, which included using screen names to mask identities, officials said. The bulletin board also had a ""Handbook Project,"" where members contributed to a guide on how to find and groom boys to engage in sex and how to move on to other victims when the current victim grows too old to be attractive to the members, authorities said.","A secret internet bulletin board devoted to child pornography was called ""Lost Boy""

"Washington (CNN) -- Radiation from airport body scanners penetrates organs beneath the skin but at low doses that meet national standards, according to a study by Marquette University's Department of Biomedical Engineering. But the study's author, professor Taly Gilat-Schmidt, said the research does not answer the biggest question on travelers' minds: Are scanners safe? She said more independent research is needed. The Marquette study subjected government and vendor data to sophisticated computer modeling to estimate the radiation doses travelers receive when they are scanned by backscatter machines, one of two types of imagers used to detect weapons at security checkpoints. The Transportation Security Administration has maintained that the machines are safe, exposing travelers to about the same radiation they receive by flying about two minutes at cruising altitude. A passenger would have to receive more than 17,000 screenings in a year -- about 47 screenings a day, 365 days a year -- to exceed government standards, the TSA says. The Marquette study says that the backscatter dose is ""comparable"" to one minute of exposure to cosmic radiation and considerably lower than radiation levels of other X-ray procedures, such as a mammogram. But it balks at calling the exposures safe, saying cosmic and backscatter radiation are different and that both the risks and benefits of backscatter need to be quantified. Experts: Body scanning 'woefully inadequate' abroad . John Sedat, a University of California, San Francisco, professor of biochemistry and biophysics, is against the TSA's use of backscatter technology. He criticized the Marquette report, saying it was based on TSA data instead of independent testing of machines. ""It's a valid criticism,"" responded Gilat-Schmidt. ""I think that's valid, and we put that criticism (in the paper). But that's how research is. It's not the whole enchilada. It's one step; not the whole step."" ""I think it's very important to have independent studies,"" she said. Gilat-Schmidt said that she goes through backscatter X-ray machines, but ""I don't feel comfortable putting my kids through them."" ""That's because in the medical imaging community, it's always stressed that the (radiation) dosage should be as low as possible. And in this case, the lowest possible is not going through them. There's an alternative technology out there,"" she said. Two options are millimeter wave machines, which use radio waves, and physical pat-downs. The Marquette paper will be published in the June issue of Medical Physics, an international journal of medical physics research and practice, produced by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. The research was conducted by Marquette student Michael Hoppe with Gilat-Schmidt's assistance. A TSA spokesman said the agency was aware of the Marquette study but had not yet done a thorough analysis of it.","The Transportation Security Administration maintains the machines are safe .

"(CNN) -- Picture a field full of heavy-set men sporting shaved heads and covered with tattoos. They pump their fists in the air and dance raucously in front of a stage festooned with Nazi flags and racist skinhead symbols. Others, including a few women, watch around the perimeter. Onstage, people are playing deafening music, shouting more than singing, with lyrics urging white people ""to stand up and fight."" Without the racism element, this might just be another concert. But this is music with a message -- a white power music concert. Every year, versions of this scene play out across the United States, if not in a field, perhaps in an old warehouse or, more rarely, an actual music club. Some white supremacists drive for hundreds of miles to attend. Others purchase or download white power music from the Internet. Since white power music arrived in the United States in the late 1970s, it has become a pillar of the subculture permeating the white supremacist movement. White supremacist groups strong . It is in this subculture that Wade Page, the white supremacist responsible for the massacre earlier this week at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, moved, made friends, and fully immersed himself. Page, 41, was a white supremacist skinhead who played in two white power music bands, End Apathy and Definite Hate, affiliated with the Hammerskins. The Hammerskins are a longstanding hardcore racist skinhead group with a history of violence and hate crimes. Page was a member, identifying himself as a Northern Hammerskin, part of the group's upper Midwest branch. White power music is a small music scene, not comparable to any mainstream music genre. The largest concerts won't attract more than 300 people; most organizers would be happy to see half that number. Music, military marked Sikh temple gunman's path . At any given time, about 100 to 150 white power bands are in the United States. The bands' own names defiantly express feelings of hate or violence: Aggravated Assault, Angry Aryans, Attack, Definite Hate, Final Solution, Force Fed Hate, Fueled by Hate, Hate Crime, Jew Slaughter and White Terror, among others. Most of these bands are the white supremacist equivalents of garage bandsÃ¢â¬ânobody is getting rich from this music. Behind them are small record labels or distributors that specialize in white power music: Label 56, Tightrope Records, Final Stand Records, and others. Many bands are associated with a racist skinhead group such as Volksfront, the Vinlanders Social Club or, especially, the Hammerskins. The Hammerskins dominate much of the white power music scene. Many bands are Hammerskins-affiliated, while the group itself organizes hate music concerts, including Hammerfest, its largest annual event. Temple killings put spotlight on hate rock . The music comes in many flavors. The oldest is a racist form of Oi!, associated with the original skinhead subculture in Great Britain. Also popular is hatecore, a white supremacist version of hardcore punk. A white supremacist form of death metal music, known as National Socialist Black Metal Music or NSBM, has become popular. There are other small subgenres of hate music; even a few white power hip hop artists, though most white supremacists dislike hip hop. White power music conveys many messages. Obviously, it conveys hatred: antagonism toward Jews, immigrants, nonwhites, Muslims, gays and left-wingers. But songs can convey other messages, too. Some white power songs may glorify heroes or martyrs of the white supremacist movement. Some are essentially self-promotional, praising a group or leader. Songs that urge or celebrate generic violence are also common, emerging from a subculture in which violence is easily condoned. A number of songs attempt to convey some sense of commonality, to strengthen the sense that listeners are in a movement with shared ideas, goals -- or enemies. What are the effects of white power music? It's often hard to know exactly how music of any kind may affect someone. Music is universally acknowledged as powerful, yet its effects are often indirect. Hate music does sometimes create direct effects. Incidents of hate crimes being committed by people who had just been at a hate music event have been reported. More indirectly, hate music certainly contributes to the shared ideas and notions of the white supremacist movement, including its willing acceptance of violence. But there is a ""chicken and egg"" question, too. It is almost certainly the case that, for many white supremacists, the music doesn't motivate them to violence so much as reflect attitudes about hate and violence they already possess. Does the music motivate them to be hateful, or does the fact that they are hateful cause them to appreciate the music? For each individual, there's probably a different answer. White power music is often cited as a recruiting tool for white supremacists. This is certainly true to some degree, although most of their recruitment tends to be passive rather than active. Organized attempts are made from time to time by white supremacist groups to use white power music to attract young people, but none of these attempts has truly been successful. Of more importance is simply the existence of hate music. A certain number of people will like the music or the message, or both, and some may be drawn into the movement itself. The Internet has allowed more people to encounter this music than previously. What can be done about this music and the violence it seems to beget? One solution is to shine the light of day on the hateful lyrics and subculture, so that more people will speak out and reject their disturbing and sometimes violent message. This is part of the work we at the Anti-Defamation League do every day. A previous version of this commentary incorrectly included the band Hatebreed in a list of white power bands. Hatebreed is a self-described ""hardcore metal"" band. CNN regrets the error. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lonnie Nasatir.","Lonnie Nasatir: Tattooed men pump fists in front of Nazi flags at white power music concerts .

"(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama met Monday afternoon with Mexican President Felipe Calderon in the first face-to-face talks of the incoming U.S. leader with a foreign head of state. Mexican President Felipe Calderon discussed immigration and trade issues with Barack Obama. The meeting at the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington fulfilled a tradition in effect since 1980 of U.S. presidents talking with their Mexican counterparts before being sworn in, to underscore the special relationship between the two nations. Obama takes the oath of office on January 20. Speaking to the press afterward, Obama said the tradition is ""appropriate"" because of the ""extraordinary relationship"" between the two countries. ""My message today is that my administration is going to be ready on Day One to build a stronger relationship with Mexico,"" he said. Calderon and Obama said the two leaders discussed a wide range of issues, including security, the economy and immigration. Security is a primary concern for Mexico, where drug-fueled violence reached record levels last year. The nation recorded around 5,400 slayings in 2008, more than double the 2,477 reported in 2007. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich characterized the battle among drug cartels and with government authorities as a ""civil war"" on a news program Sunday. ""The more secure Mexico is, the more secure the United States will be,"" Calderon said, first in Spanish and then in English, to make sure no one missed the point. Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, attended a three-hour private dinner Calderon hosted Sunday night for non-governmental U.S. specialists and experts on Mexico. Security was a prime topic. ""Both countries share a long border,"" Hakim told CNN on Monday. ""They are terribly worried about the violence from organized crime in Mexico and slipover into the U.S.""  Watch how the meeting will highlight the two countries' special ties Â» . That's a message Calderon wanted to make sure Obama heard. ""This common problem of organized crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, which is an international problem, we can fight together,"" Calderon said after the meeting, again in both Spanish and English. ""Mexico wants to make clear what they are doing about this,"" Hakim said. ""They're investing a lot of money into it and the extensive reforms they are going through now."" Those reforms include revamping police and judicial systems, trying to root out corruption and using new technology, Hakim said. ""The message he has is that Mexico is investing its heart and soul into this,"" Hakim said. Obama will likely be receptive to that message, said Michael Shifter, a vice president at the Inter-American Dialogue. ""I think Obama is going to understand that Mexico is very important to the United States,"" Shifter told CNN last week. ""This isn't an issue that he has focused a lot of attention on up until now. But he's going to understand that if Mexico really deteriorates or if the violence spills over into the border states, this is a war that he really has to deal with."" Mexico is also concerned, Hakim said, because of the vast number of firearms being smuggled from the United States into Mexico. Many of those weapons end up in the hands of drug traffickers. Robert Pastor, a former National Security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and now a professor of international relations at American University in Washington, said weapons sales are a thriving business along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. ""There are 7,600 gun shops within 50 miles of the Mexican border, and they're selling primarily to drug lords,"" Pastor told CNN recently. ""We are part of this problem and we haven't been significantly supportive."" Calderon probably told Obama Mexico does not want U.S. money but does want the United States to help curb that flow of lethal firepower, Hakim said. ""Mexico wants the U.S. to be helpful where it can be most helpful,"" he said. The economy is another area of concern to Mexico, and Calderon would like the United States ""to get its economy back in shape,"" Hakim said. ""Mexico has done everything right and is suffering the U.S. meltdown,"" he said, noting that Mexico has kept budget deficits and inflation down and its banks are in good shape. ""They come with a clean bill of health,"" said Hakim. ""It's the U.S. that overborrowed, overspent and ran up huge trade deficits. Mexico had none of that."" Obama and Calderon said they also discussed immigration, though Hakim noted that Mexico understands that issue is not a top priority right now for the United States. Asked how he sensed the mood of Mexico's leaders toward the incoming administration in Washington, Hakim said, ""They're very hopeful."" But he noted that there are some concerns, especially with trade issues and the North American Free Trade Agreement that the two countries and Canada signed in late 1993. Obama has said he would like to renegotiate the pact. ""It's no secret they're a little bit concerned about his statement during the campaign about redoing NAFTA,"" Hakim said. ""But my suspicion is that this is less of a concern than the other issues I mentioned."" In addition to Hakim, Calderon's office said other participants at Sunday night's dinner meeting included Sidney Weintraub of the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas; former U.S. Rep. James Thomas Kolbe, now a fellow at the German Marshall Fund public policy institute; and Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute. Calderon is scheduled to meet with President Bush on Tuesday.","NEW: Obama: Ready ""to build a stronger relationship with Mexico""

"New York (CNN) -- Chad, a 46-year-old father, is still afraid to tell his mother about the woman nearly 25 years his senior who used to sneak into his room at night and crawl into his bed. He doesn't want her to feel guilty. She was his mom's best friend. ""She would get into my bed naked. Make me take off my clothes and make me touch her. Then, she'd touch me. We would masturbate and ... do stuff,"" says Chad, pausing to recall what happened so long ago. ""It went on for a long time. She said it was our secret. That she loved me. That's how I learned about sex."" He was 10 years old when the abuse began. ""After her, I got my girlfriend pregnant a few years later. I don't know ... maybe that's why I'm so messed up now. I have problems with relationships."" Until the Penn State child rape case took over our national conversation, Chad (all names have been changed at the request of the interview subjects) had never told his story. He wasn't even sure he'd been abused. No doubt he'd feel very differently if he were talking about his 10-year-old daughter lying in bed with a 35-year-old man. According to national studies, one in every six boys are sexually abused before the age of 16. And yes, the majority of pedophiles are men, but as much as 40% of sexual abuse is perpetrated by women. Chad's story is not unusual. It is unusual that he's talking about it. And it's healthy. For many reasons, experts say, men face different feelings of shame and guilt than women experience when reporting childhood sexual abuse. Men don't want to be viewed as weaklings for allowing the abuse. They worry that their sexuality will be questioned if the abuser was another man. And in cases like Chad's where the pedophile was a woman, men may even feel societal pressure to brag about the early unwanted sexual activity. Either way, the long-term mental effects can be devastating. Don Lemon: No matter the gender, rape is rape . Boys who are sexually exploited can have problems later with anger, self-loathing and drinking. They often live recklessly and have intimacy problems, among other serious long-term issues, says Kali Munro, a psychotherapist with more than 25 years' experience. As a mother of a teenage son and Penn State alum, I am struggling to grasp the horrific details surrounding the Penn State case. Jerry Sandusky, 67, a former Penn State assistant coach, faces 40 criminal charges in the alleged rape and sexual abuse of eight boys over a 15-year period. But as the disturbing story unfolds, I have begun to notice the beginning of something very positive. Grown men are talking openly about abuse they experienced as boys. Men are beginning to heal. Across my neighborhood, friends and families are sharing their painful secrets over kitchen tables -- and often a glass of wine -- without the fear of ridicule or shame men often face around this topic. Sports have always been a safe conversation. But it's tricky. Abuse experts say that men under-report these childhood incidents when they are called ""abuse,"" but when they are asked about ""unwanted sexual experiences,"" the numbers may be higher than one in six. Not surprising in a world where men are not supposed to be victims, even as little boys. For Gary, it was his priest. A huge football fan and happily married father of three, Gary says the Penn State story hurts. He grew up in the Catholic Church and was an altar boy. He was 9 years old, he says, when his priest began being nice to him, giving him special assignments around the church and making him feel special. ""I would stay after and help clean up the church,"" he says, nearly tearing as he remembers. But then, the touching started, he says, the wrestling, the horseplay -- words consistently used by Sandusky's alleged victims. ""One night, we were wrestling and the priest pinned me underneath him. He grabbed my genitals and started rubbing me there. I didn't know what to do,"" Gary says. ""But somehow, I got out of his grip. I think I may have hit him and I ran home crying."" But when Gary got home and told his mother what the priest had done, she didn't believe him. The priest was beloved in their community. Gary got into trouble for telling lies. It's not uncommon for parents to be in denial, and feel guilt or anger at a child, when first hearing of abuse, experts say. One of the most upsetting things about the Penn State story is it appears that so many adults knew about the abuse allegations, as far back as 1998, but kept silent, in order to save the reputation of the university's football program. It was disgusting behavior. Those people should all go to prison. I'm hopeful that these are different days from when Chad and Gary grew up. And at least one boy I know thinks so. Jason turns 12 Saturday. His family is planning a big party, he says, a reward for getting A's in school this year. It's taken a lot of hard work and counseling to get Jason to this happy place. Jason was 7 when his father introduced him to hardcore pornography. ""I didn't know what it was, but I knew it was bad. Dad said not to tell Mom,"" he told me the other day. His father said he would beat him if he told anyone. He was afraid. As Jason started to have trouble in school and became moody at home, his mother worried. She didn't know what was wrong. ""It took him years to tell me about what was going on with his father,"" she says. When I asked Jason how he found the courage to tell, he says easily: ""Mom always said not to lie. I was scared Dad would be mad, but I was more scared of keeping a secret."" After Jason told about the porn sessions, his father left the family and never came back. ""I miss him,"" Jason says quietly. But he knows he made the right decision and has a message for boys who feel they have been violated in any way: . ""If something bad happens to you and the person tells you not to tell, you should definitely tell right away. Tell a parent or the cops. Tell somebody."" I'm wishing Jason a very happy birthday.

"(CNN) -- Zilda Arns Neumann, a Brazilian doctor and care worker dedicated to helping the people of Haiti, was among those who died in Tuesday's devastating earthquake. She was 75. Brazilians were shocked at the loss of Arns, who founded a well-known charity in Haiti called Children's Pastoral. It specialized in providing education and aid to children, pregnant women, and families. The Nobel Peace Prize nominee was back in the country attending a religion conference and teaching classes to motivate leaders and volunteers of her organization, according to a statement on the Children's Pastoral Web site. For her work in Haiti, Arns earned comparisons to India's Mother Teresa, according to local media. Her nephew, Brazilian Sen. Flavio Arns, told the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency that her death came after she finished a speech at a church. As people were leaving, she stayed behind to speak with the pastor and was inside when the structure collapsed, he said. ""The Arns family hopes that this awakening of international solidarity will continue beyond the tragedy imposed by nature, always in defense of full dignity to people,"" Flavio Arns said. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is among dignitaries who will attend Arns' wake Friday in Brazil, according to the Children's Pastoral Web site. As of Thursday afternoon, Brazilian authorities had confirmed 15 Brazilians killed in the quake.","Brazilian doctor founded Haitian charity dedicated to helping women and children .

"(CNN) -- How do you imagine the computer of the future? In movies like ""Iron Man"" and ""Minority Report,"" characters reach out and move virtual objects around in midair with their hands, sending windows and images sailing through 3-D space without touching a keyboard or controller. That future is now here. The new Leap Motion controller, which starts shipping preorders Monday and costs $80, is the first commercial gadget that will bring some of that Hollywood magic to laptops and desktops. The screen is still two-dimensional for now, but fingers and hands are free to poke, grab and flick in 3-D to move through applications. The device will go on sale at Best Buy on July 28. CNN tested out the new controller to get a taste of this touch-free future. (Full disclosure: Last month we named Leap Motion as one of our 10 startups to watch for 2013.) Here are our impressions: . Motion detection . Motion-detection sensors are presumed to be the next big input device for computers, complementing existing input technology like the mouse, keyboard, touchscreen and voice control. The Leap Motion controller follows in the footsteps of the Microsoft Kinect. But where the Kinect tracks large movements for the entire body, the Leap is meant for small, subtle hand movements made close to the screen. Leap says its technology can track precise movements to within one-hundredth of a millimeter. Optimally, the Leap controller sits about an inch in front of the keyboard, lined up with the middle of the computer screen. Its sensors can pick up movement as far as 2 feet up in the air and 2 feet out from each side of the device, creating an invisible oblong field for moving your hands around. The Mac- and Windows-compatible controller plugs into a USB port and is remarkably small -- close in size to a pack of gum. The half-inch-high and 3-inch-long rectangle is also impressively light, weighing in at a tenth of a pound. The device isn't just a another way to nudge a cursor around or input data. ""Our philosophy is not that the Leap is intended to replace the mouse and keyboard,"" said Michael Buckwald, Leap's co-founder and CEO. He says the Leap controller can tap into a new way of working with applications that is richer than existing methods, but will never be a more efficient way to do certain tasks, like enter data into a spreadsheet. ""The Leap is not binary,"" he said. ""The mouse can only be clicking or not clicking."" Leap has been working with developers to create apps specifically for the controller. The Leap Motion apps are cordoned off in their own launch application, called Airspace. To buy new apps, you are taken to the Web-based Airspace store where they are sorted by category or platform. There are a few professional apps, lots of casual games, tools for learning a new instrument like a harp or piano, and educational programs. Most are platform agnostic, but about 30% are only for Windows or Mac. Windows users can install Unlock, which lets you unlock your computer by waving your hand above the controller. It recognizes your unique hand shape and uses it as a password. Drawbacks . Using the Leap to navigate this added dimension has its challenges. Gestures are not unified across all apps. Scrolling might be a forward circular motion with a single finger in one app, and left to right in another. Apps include instructions, but getting the feel for each one takes time. The Leap works best when your hands are parallel to the desk. If a hand is too vertical, the sensors can't pick out individual fingers. The Leap sensors are extremely sensitive. This is great for when you want to make small precise movements, but maddeningly finicky when you're just trying to do something simple like select a button. In the app Frog Dissection, pinning a virtual amphibian to a table to dissect it requires a steady hand. Keeping your arms and hands very still -- a requirement in many programs to select something on the screen -- is harder and more tiring than it looks. Leap suggests using the device with your elbows propped on the desk. When you are in the zone in an app -- having mastered where your hands need to be and how much movement is just enough -- the tracking can be incredibly accurate and the results impressive. This is best demonstrated in creative apps that help users make music or art. It's also fun for zipping through the universe in your own private planetarium using the Exoplanet app. The effort it takes to make an app decipher your 3-D movements can make some tasks more difficult, not less. Take the clean, simple New York Times app for Leap. The app shows one row of articles and a few simple gestures for selecting and scrolling through them. It takes practice to get the hang of it, and even once you do, the experience is halting. Sometimes you'll send the queue racing off in the wrong direction. Other times you'll wonder why your article-closing hand wave isn't being picked up by the controller. The New York Times app hits on a common issue with many of these early Leap applications: Using 3-D gestures doesn't improve on many experiences. Reading the Times, playing ""Cut the Rope"" and dissecting a digital frog would all be more satisfying experiences on a touchscreen device (or, for the latter, on an actual frog). A promising future . Despite these limitations, the Leap technology has a bright future. Developers are working on new apps and on integrating Leap support into existing ones -- the Google Earth app is an early example. Another app called Touchless attempts to bring Leap controls to regular Mac and Windows OS actions. Buckwald said that while the company has been focusing on this controller for now, the hardware is small enough to be built into mobile devices like a tablet. Working directly with an equipment manufacturer could result in a more controlled and consistent experience. The Leap Motion controller is a promising foray into desktop 3-D gesture control. The technology feels like the rough first draft of something that will grow more polished over time. It's still young, and will hopefully improve as developers pinpoint the best ways to use it. The Leap is a curiosity worth watching. But for now, don't ditch your keyboard and mouse.","Leap Motion controller lets you manipulate computer apps with hand gestures .

"(CNN) -- ""Be not afraid"" was the message of Pope John Paul II's Inaugural Mass. It's a message American conservatives need to take to heart again in the era of Barack Obama. From TV and radio come warnings that the unwise policies of the Obama administration threaten or doom the United States. We are treading the road to serfdom, it's said. Time is running out. The brilliant Peggy Noonan gave voice to these fears in a highly perceptive column a couple of weeks ago: . ""I see two central reasons for the tea party's rise. The first is the yardstick, and the second is the clock. First, the yardstick. Imagine that over at the 36-inch end you've got pure liberal thinking -- more and larger government programs, a bigger government that costs more in the many ways that cost can be calculated. Over at the other end you've got conservative thinking -- a government that is growing smaller and less demanding and is less expensive. You assume that when the two major parties are negotiating bills in Washington, they sort of lay down the yardstick and begin negotiations at the 18-inch line. Each party pulls in the direction it wants, and the dominant party moves the government a few inches in their direction. ""But if you look at the past half century or so you have to think: How come even when Republicans are in charge, even when they're dominant, government has always gotten larger and more expensive? It's always grown!"" Noonan aptly describes the despair that many conservatives these days feel. The good news is this despair is wrong. The yardstick does not measure only one way, the ratchet does not always grip against us. In fact, the story of the past 50 years has been that the American economy has become freer and more dynamic. Think back to 1960. The federal government regulated the price of every airfare. It regulated every rail, truck and shipping route. It regulated the price of natural gas. It regulated stockbrokers' commissions. It regulated the interest rates that could be paid on checking accounts. It told most farmers how much they could grow of what commodity. It regulated what kind of political and religious comment could be expressed on the airwaves. And of course it conscripted millions of young men beginning their careers into the armed forces. All of that is gone, gone, gone. True, in other ways society is more regulated than it used to be. There was no Clean Water Act back then, no Americans with Disabilities Act. I think most Americans -- even most Tea Party members -- support the new environmental and antidiscrimination acts that have replaced the old regulation of transport, energy and financial pricing. But whether you support the new laws or oppose them, it's just wrong to say we're treading a one-way road to serfdom. Yet Noonan is exactly right in her assessment that this is what the Tea Party followers think: That we're on a road of no return and that we're running out of time to correct our ways. This is what Noonan calls ""the clock"": . ""It's getting late. If we don't get the size and cost of government in line now, we won't be able to. We're teetering on the brink of some vast, dark new world-states and cities on the brink of bankruptcy, the federal government too."" Anybody who has spent time with conservative-minded Americans can attest to the sense of foreboding and urgency reported by Noonan. It's five minutes to midnight; freedom is on the verge of permanent extinguishment. In these tough economic times, who will deny that there is much reason for foreboding? Yet conservatives sell our own accomplishments and principles short when they represent them as so fragile. The fact is: our win-loss ratio is actually pretty good. Free-market ideas have rescued states in much worse trouble than post-Obama America: Mao's China to name one outstanding example. I can see why an anticapitalist radical would want to insist that capitalism is fragile and ready to collapse. But why would an American conservative concede such a preposterous claim? ""The facts of life,"" as Margaret Thatcher so powerfully said, ""are conservative."" And as Ronald Reagan said, paraphrasing John Adams, ""Facts are stubborn things."" Those facts will reassert themselves. And so will the strength, dynamism, and creativity of the American economy. Yes, Americans have some urgent decisions to make. Yes, the bad decisions of the Obama administration will be hard and painful to correct. But they are correctable. No good decision was ever made in panic. So don't panic. Don't despair. Take a deep breath. Have confidence. Assess the challenge without complacency, but also without exaggeration. Think, organize and act. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Some conservatives lament U.S. has moved decisively toward socialism .
He says the reality is that the U.S. is much freer today than in 1960 .
Government control of the economy and of expression is much reduced, he says .
Frum says the ""strength, dynamism and creativity of the American economy"" will prevail ."
"(CNN) -- The highly-fancied Russia team and co-hosts Poland crashed out of Euro 2012 on Saturday as the Czech Republic and Greece became the first nations to secure quarterfinal berths. Russia led Group A going into the third and final round of matches, needing just a draw against Greece to progress into the last eight. However, a superb strike from veteran Greece captain Giorgis Karagounis just before halftime proved enough to send Dick Advocaat's side home. ""When we left Greece, we all said, 'We will give everything when our compatriots aren't having the best of times,' said Karagounis, referring to Greece's economic problems. ""I believe that this tonight puts a smile on their faces. We're happy we managed to do this for Greece, for our country, for Greeks all over the world."" Euro 2012: Day 9 as it happened . The Russians had a better goal difference than the Greeks, who won the tournament in a huge shock in 2004, but went out on head-to-head record. Poland needed to win to go through, but a 72nd-minute strike from Petr Jiracek sent the Czechs top of the table and facing a quarterfinal against the runner-up from Group B -- which will be decided on Sunday. Greece 1-0 Russia . Karagounis experienced the high of sending his country through to the knockout stage of a major tournament for the first time in eight years, but the 35-year-old may not get the chance to break his country's appearance record at Euro 2012. The midfielder will miss the quarterfinal after receiving his second yellow card of the group stages, having been controversially booked for diving when it appeared that he had been fouled in the penalty area in the second half. With Greece leading 1-0, a second goal would have killed off Russia's hopes -- but instead a furious Karagounis missed a nailbiting climax to the match after demanding to be substituted before he was sent off for further remonstrating with Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson. Karagounis, who matched 2004 captain Theodoros Zagorakis' mark of 120 caps for Greece, repeated his act of scoring at the European Championship, having done so in the opening match against Portugal eight years ago. He surged through the Russian defense after Sergei Ignashevich failed to deal with a throw-in and fired a low shot past goalkeeper Vyacheslav Malafeev in time added on at the end of the first half. Giorgos Tzavellas almost made it 2-0 with 20 minutes to play, but his curling left-foot free kick bounced to safety off the post. After that it was all Russia, but Igor Denisov was twice denied by goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis. It marked a disappointing end to the two-year reign of Advocaat, who will now return to his homeland with a post at Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. ""The other team just defended. With all due respect, it was hard to play against them. But it's not that we didn't play well,"" Advocaat said. ""We were undefeated for 16 games but we didn't win today. That's football. All compliments to Greece."" Czech Republic 1-0 Poland . Poland had high hopes of making the most of home advantage in Wroclaw, but could not beat a Czech team that bounced back from their opening 4-1 crushing by Russia to top the group with six points. Jiracek followed up his opening goal from the 2-1 win over Poland with another vital strike. The 26-year-old midfielder, who plays for German club Wolfsburg, cut inside to beat goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton after being fed by veteran striker Milan Baros on the counter attack following good work by Tomas Hubschman. Poland poured forward in search of an equalizer, which by itself would not have been enough, but Michal Kadlec cleared a late effort off the line. ""We started badly and let the occasion get to us a little bit, the home side capitalized on our mistakes,"" Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech said. ""But with time we got better, we created chances and then scored a deserved goal."" The Czechs will next go to Warsaw on June 21, where their opponents will likely be Portugal, Denmark or Holland. The Greeks are likely to face unbeaten Germany in Gdansk. Poland coach Franciszek Smuda is now expected to be replaced, as his contract has ended. ""We know we had the chance to win but they (the Czech) played excellent football and they scored a goal,"" he told reporters. ""We had several opportunities in the first half but we didn't take our chances.""","Czech Republic and Greece first teams into quarterfinals at Euro 2012 .

"(CNN) -- It is 10 years since Maria Sharapova became the darling of Wimbledon's hallowed Center Court. Just 17 and with a mere six grand slam appearances to her name, she was a huge underdog against Serena Williams -- then already a formidable force in women's tennis. But Sharapova did the unthinkable, demolishing the defending champion and delighting the crowd, as the smiling teenager opened up her mobile phone on court to contact her mother. It was ""the jump start of my career, where it all began for me,"" says the first Russian woman to win Wimbledon. ""To think back that I was holding that trophy as a 17-year-old girl is really special. It really makes me feel really happy inside when I look back on those years,"" Sharapova told CNN's Open Court ahead of this week's return to London's hallowed grass courts. ""Of course it was a little bit of a blur, so young, I was in this incredible dream, this incredible run to the finals. And then winning it, it takes a while to realize, 'Yes, I've done it, I've accomplished that, I've won Wimbledon.' "" A decade later, the two women are again favorites to win Wimbledon -- even if the grass surface has not always proved a happy stomping ground for Sharapova in the intervening years. She has reached the final just once since those heady days in 2004 -- losing to Czech surprise package Petra Kvitova in 2011 -- and made a shock second-round exit last year to Portugal's 131st-ranked Michelle Larcher de Brito. Meanwhile, Williams has won three more championships in London in the past decade. The dream for many fans is of a repeat Sharapova-Williams final showdown, but last Friday's draw means they could meet in the last eight. ""For both of us 10 years later to still be grinding, and working, and loving what we do -- I think it's really inspiring for a lot of people around the world because we've gone through a lot in those years,"" says Sharapova, who won her fifth grand slam title at this month's French Open, while Williams exited early. ""We've battled through injuries, through losses, through wins and we're still there."" Baby-faced teen to sports star supreme . Right now, Sharapova's confidence is sky-high -- though it wasn't always the case. The five-time grand slam winner sacked coach Jimmy Connors last year after just one match together, which she lost. Her new partnership with Sweden's Sven Groeneveld appears to be working out a lot better; in Paris she regained the title that Williams took from her the previous year. But it was her first Wimbledon win that really set Sharapova on her way to global superstardom. Within a week she was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and today banks about $30 million a year, of which barely a fifth comes from on-court prize money thanks to lucrative sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike and Head. It makes her the world's highest-paid female athlete on Forbes' list. ""No matter how prepared you may be, I actually think it's better not to know what will happen,"" she says of her Wimbledon win. ""Because everything that comes your way seems so better and so much more when you don't have expectations and you have incredible opportunities,"" ""I look back and I go, 'Wow, I was on the cover of Sports Illustrated as a 17-year-old girl.' ""I was not naive but I didn't know how cool these things really were and I think that is why I kept myself really grounded, because I was happy and I smiled and I had a great time doing those other things."" Love match . And with fame, came intense media scrutiny. Today, Sharapova's every move on and off the court is followed by the press -- from her burgeoning business empire to her blossoming relationship with fellow tennis player Grigor Dimitrov, who won the Wimbledon warmup tournament at London's Queen's Club last week. The Bulgarian -- nicknamed ""Baby Fed"" after comparisons with men's legend Roger Federer early in his career -- credited partner Sharapova for the victory. She appears similarly enthused by the 18-month romance. ""He's so talented out on the court and so smart at what he does. It's really inspiring to watch him play -- even when he doesn't have a good day and loses, I am really inspired by what he is able to produce out there,"" she says. ""It's really fun, we enjoy watching each other play. It is also always nice to have good company, that understands what you go through, the tough and the good. To be able to share that, I am certainly lucky."" Brand Sharapova . In the last decade Sharapova has become a lucrative brand in her own right, signing a three-year advertising deal with Porsche last year among her many endorsements, and launching her own confectionery called Sugarpova. Where does this business drive come from? ""I am actually really scared of doing nothing,"" she says. ""Because all my career, all my life I've woken up, made my tea or coffee and then am ready to do something, to commit to something. ""It has been tennis for many years and especially when I missed out a year from shoulder surgery, it gave me time to think 'well, this can happen on any given day and you cannot play sport anymore, what are you going to do?'"" It might be hard to believe that the businesswoman leading this sporting empire, still sees herself as the teenage girl who climbed up to hug her father Yuri in the players' box after her Wimbledon triumph. ""I think from a very young age, I knew I didn't have so many strengths in my game,"" she says. ""I knew I wasn't the strongest athlete out there, I knew I didn't have an incredible amount of weapons out there but I knew from a young age that focus, especially in tennis, was one of the biggest weapons that you can have."" For the next fortnight, that focus is firmly on Wimbledon. Insight: The mom giving tennis parents a good name .","Maria Sharapova won Wimbledon title as a teenager a decade ago .

"Washington (CNN) -- The president of South Korea has vowed ""resolute"" measures against North Korea for its alleged attack on a South Korean warship, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported Thursday. A five-country committee announced Thursday morning in Seoul that they had concluded a North Korean submarine fired a torpedo that sunk the South Korea warship in March. Investigators recovered a propeller from the torpedo that blew the Cheonan in half on March 26, Yoon Duk-yong, the committee's co-chair, told reporters. The propeller was from the kind of ""torpedoes that were exported from North Korea and the letters and the fonts on the torpedo are the are the same that are used by North Korea,"" Yoon said at a Thursday morning news conference. ""This torpedo was manufactured in North Korea."" Yoon said that the investigation found that a small to mid-sized North Korea sub ""fired the torpedo that sunk the Cheonan vessel and retreated back to their border."" As the 1,200-ton vessel went down, 46 sailors were lost near disputed waters in the Yellow Sea. ""(We) will take resolute countermeasures against North Korea and make it admit its wrongdoings through strong international cooperation and return to the international community as a responsible member,"" President Lee Myung-bak told Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in phone talks, according to Lee's office, Yonhap reported. North Korea denied torpedoing the warship just as the team of investigators in Seoul unveiled their report. ""We had already warned the South Korean group of traitors not to make reckless remarks concerning the sinking of warship Cheonan of the puppet navy,"" North Korea's National Defence Commission said in a statement, according to the Korean Central News Agency. ""Nevertheless, the group of traitors had far-fetchedly tried to link the case with us without offering any material evidence."" ""It finally announced the results of the joint investigation based on a sheer fabrication"" the defense commission said, according to the state-run KCNA. The commission called the new report part of a ""smear campaign."" The White House backed the report issued Thursday in Seoul, saying it ""points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that North Korea was responsible for the attack."" ""This act of aggression is one more instance of North Korea's unacceptable behavior and defiance of international law,"" said a statement by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. ""This attack constitutes a challenge to international peace and security and is a violation of the Armistice Agreement."" President Obama spoke with South Korean President Lee bak on Monday and ""made clear that the United States fully supports the Republic of Korea, both in the effort to secure justice for the 46 service members killed in this attack and in its defense against further acts of aggression,"" Gibbs said. ""North Korea must understand that belligerence towards its neighbors and defiance of the international community are signs of weakness, not strength,"" Gibbs' statement said. ""Such unacceptable behavior only deepens North Korea's isolation. It reinforces the resolve of its neighbors to intensify their cooperation to safeguard peace and stability in the region against all provocations."" The United States has a mutual defense treaty with South Korea and Japan to defend ""against any aggression,"" so if a military confrontation develops, the United States would be responsible for defending South Korea, a U.S. military official said. ""I don't think it will come to that,"" the official said. ""They know they need to have a response, but there is too much at stake for South Korea to have a confrontation on the Korean peninsula. North Korea has nothing to lose, but South Korea is a serious country with a huge economy."" There are military options for South Korea beyond firing missiles, said John Delury, who studies North and South Korea at the Asia Society. Anything combative would hurt South Korea economically, Delury said, but the country could increase its naval presence along the line that divides South and North Korea in the waters surrounding the countries. He notes that comes with a risk. ""Those actions could trigger a conflict,"" he noted. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who will visit Seoul next week, will talk with the South Korean government about the investigation, Assistant Secretary Campbell said. Clinton will also visit Japan and China during her trip, and the North Korean issue is likely to be high on the agenda. Clinton will have ""the closest possible consultations with Japan, China and South Korea about the next phase,"" Campbell said. On Monday, President Obama spoke on the phone about the investigation with President Lee. The president reiterated ""the strong and unwavering commitment of the United States to the defense and the well-being of its close friend and ally, the Republic of Korea,"" a White House statement said about the conversation.

"Washington (CNN) -- Russian military exercises near Ukraine are raising concerns that Moscow may be putting troops in position to move across the border if such orders are issued, a senior U.S. official familiar with the most recent administration assessment told CNN Thursday. But the United States still believes that Russia doesn't plan to order its forces into its tumultuous neighbor, the official said on the condition of anonymity. U.S. officials -- who are monitoring the area 24 hours a day -- have not yet seen signs that Russia is preparing to secure supply and transportation routes that would be crucial to any such movement, the official said. Russian military activity levels observed by the United States also ""appear to be within normal range,"" the official said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov offered reassurances Thursday to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry that the exercises were previously planned and were not being carried out because of the upheaval in Ukraine, echoing an earlier conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian Defense Ministry has said the combat readiness evaluation is being carried out in territory overseen by the western and central military commands. That puts some of the exercises near the Ukraine border. ""All in all, about 150 thousand military personnel of different services of the armed forces and military commands are involved in the check,"" Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said in a statement released by the ministry. ""Up to 90 planes, more than 120 helicopters, up to 880 tanks, over 1,200 defense equipment units and about 80 ships will be used."" U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, where he was meeting with NATO defense ministers, that the United States was following the developments in and around the Ukraine. ""Until we really know more details -- what's really happening there, who is in charge, I think the focus should be ... let's keep the tensions down. Let's see no provocative actions by anyone, any military,"" he said. One concern is that with Russian troops out of their garrisons near Ukraine, they could be in a position to move swiftly across the border -- leaving little time for U.S. officials to try to mount diplomatic efforts to stop them, the official said. But, for now, U.S. officials believe Putin is using the hastily ordered exercises only as a message to U.S. and Ukrainian officials that he has the ability to move his military into Ukraine to protect Russian interests if he chooses to, the official said. Russia has significant interests in Ukraine. Not only does it neighbor Ukraine, the two countries are major trading partners. Many ethnic Russians live in Ukraine's east, and Russia has a major military base at Sevastopol, Ukraine. Russian officials have complained that opposition figures who have taken control of Ukraine's government are threatening pro-Russian Ukrainians. The United States is reviewing Russian tactics in its 2008 move into Georgia for clues about how Moscow might act in this instance. In that incident, Russian forces fought troops from Georgia in a brief conflict that followed Russian promises to defend Russian citizens in the restive Georgian province of South Ossetia. U.S. officials worry about a repeat of that incident, in which both sides perceived provocative actions and Russia finally moved in on a large scale. Any military intervention by Russia would be a ""grave mistake,"" Kerry warned Wednesday. ""For a country that has spoken out so frequently in the last year ... against foreign intervention in Libya, Syria, elsewhere, it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of Ukraine,"" he said. CNN's Ingrid Formanek and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report from Kiev.","NEW: About 150,000 personnel are participating in the exercises, Russia says .

"(CNN) -- Cyndi Lauper is one fabulous and fun sage. The girl had it goin' on way back in 1984 when she sang ""Money Changes Everything."" It does. Oh, I hear you. Everybody knows that. But not so fast. Fresh off her ""we were dead broke"" when we left the White House gaffe, Hillary Clinton told the British newspaper The Guardian that people in the middle class ""don't see me as part of the problem."" Why? Because, she says, when it comes to income inequality, ""we [Bill and I] pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off ... and we've done it through dint of hard work."" The Clintons do come from humble backgrounds and they did work hard back to get to where they are, but Clinton's hard work today is in the eye of the beholder. Writing a speech then delivering it for $200,000 takes some brain work, but it's a lot easier than digging ditches. Or rushing home after an eight-hour shift at Walmart to cook dinner, take care of the kids, do the laundry and then do it all again six hours later. Let's face it, when you and your beloved are worth $100 million, most Americans find it difficult to relate to your past ""hard work"" when you now have the luxury of drivers, maids, Secret Service and a mansion in Chappaqua, New York. The Guardian reporter observed in his article that laughing appears to be Clinton's ""way of acknowledging pain."" Perhaps she realized her inelegance on some level, because she let out a burst of laughter after her response. As Lauper said, money changes everything. Wouldn't it have been grand if Clinton had said, ""I worked hard, yes, but I've been blessed for so many years. I can't say I totally understand your life, but having been there once, I promise you, I'll try."" But, it's a rare wealthy politician or millionaire who will admit they don't ""get"" the middle class or the working poor. What other explanation is there for Mitt Romney's comments during his 2012 presidential run about 47% of Americans? ""All right, there are 47% who are with [President Obama],"" Romney said, ""who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them. ...These are people who pay no income tax. ... My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."" Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy) was so awesomely right when he said in the movie, ""Trading Places,"" ""The best way you hurt rich people is by turning them into poor people."" Take Sting. The rock legend is worth a mint, but he, too, came from modest means. He so desperately wants his kids to know what it's like to have a ""work ethic"" that he expects them to earn their own money. In other words, don't count on a giant inheritance from mom and dad. It's worthy exercise, except you can't change entitled people by simply withholding cash. Alfred Lubrano, an award-winning journalist and author of ""Limbo,"" said Sting's exercise is ""doomed to fail."" ""When you grow up in a white collar home, kids have absorbed so many lessons of being entitled. It's no one's fault; it's simply how it works,"" Lubrano said. In other words, Sting's kids will never know what it's like to be ""seen and not heard."" They're used to having a place at the table, not working for one. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, says if the wealthy really want to understand those with more modest means, they should resurrect Sen. Bob Graham's 100 ""Workdays."" Back in 1977, when Graham was running for governor of Florida, he told voters he would ""experience the lives of ordinary Floridians firsthand by working their jobs."" In order to accomplish that, as Graham's website put it, he worked 100 days laboring at everything from ""changing bedpans and cleaning invalids in a nursing home to wielding blowtorches as a steel worker and going without sleep as a long-haul trucker."" Graham told me, ""I learned a lot of intangibles. I learned by actually doing something as opposed to learning by listening to a lecture or reading it in a book."" Not only that, Graham said, he learned ""a lot about what government does that doesn't make sense in the real world."" Wow! Perhaps millionaire politicians should give Graham's workdays a try. Or at least get a grip on their talking points. Joe Biden did -- yes, our vice president. He told a group of people at the Summit on Working Families: ""Sometimes we talk about this stuff, about struggle. My struggle -- my God, compared to where I grew up and the way people are trying to go through things -- but here is the point I want to make -- I have been really, really fortunate."" Did our VP just admit that money does change everything?","Hillary Clinton said she pays ordinary income tax and made money through hard work .
Carol Costello says when the Clintons are worth $100 million, it's hard for Americans to relate .

""I simply cannot sit idly by as a (Republican) member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform suggests, as happened this week, that law enforcement and government employees who devote their lives to protecting our citizens be considered ""accessories to murder,'"" Holder said in a letter to members of Congress. ""Such irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric must be repudiated in the strongest possible terms,"" he said. The bitter debate follows the release this week of Justice Department documents on Capitol Hill that prompted Republican critics to charge Holder knew about the now-discredited Fast and Furious gun operation before he previously claimed in testimony before the Oversight Committee. Holder did not mention by name anyone other than Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa in his stinging rebuke of the charges that have been leveled at the attorney general. Holder insisted, as his Justice Department aides have for several days, that he was not inconsistent in his testimony. ""My testimony was truthful and accurate,"" Holder said. ""I have no recollection of knowing about Fast and Furious or of hearing its name prior to the public controversy about it. Prior to early 2011, I certainly never knew about the tactics employed in the operation."" The tactics Holder referred to center on Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents allowing illegally purchased guns to ""walk"" from Arizona gun stores to Mexico. The ATF plan was to track the weapons to Mexican drug cartels. However, many of the guns were lost in the operation, and two of them ended up at the scene where U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was murdered. New boss at AFT announces major shake-up . Holder insists that when he learned of those tactics he stopped ""uncontrolled crossing of guns across the border,"" and called for an inspector general investigation to get to the bottom of the matter. Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the committee chaired by Issa, issued a statement in response to Holder's letter. ""If Attorney General Holder had said these things five months ago when Congress asked him about Operation Fast and Furious, it might have been more believable. At this point, however, it's hard to take at face value a defense that is factually questionable, entirely self-serving, and a still incomplete account of what senior Justice Department officials knew about gun walking,"" Hill said. Holder's five-page letter included detailed explanations in response to various points raised by his critics. He concluded by saying: ""Until we move beyond the current political climate, where real solutions take a back seat to both political posturing and making headlines on cable news programs, and is deemed more important than actually solving our country's difficult challenges, nothing is going to change. I hope we can engage in a more responsible dialogue on this subject in the future.""

"(CNN) -- Last week the news broke that the world's largest permissions-based e-mail marketing company, Epsilon, had been hacked -- compromising the security of an unknown number of e-mail addresses and names. Major companies with millions of customers, such as JP Morgan Chase and Target, sent e-mail notices alerting customers of the breach. CNN's John Sutter explained that the main problem consumers face from this breach is an increased risk of targeted ""phishing"" attempts -- ""a sneakier and more sinister version of spam ... fake e-mails that try to look real because the scammer knows something about you."" Recent research from Trusteer, an internet security firm, indicates that mobile users may be three times more likely to fall victim to e-mail phishing attempts. This is becoming increasingly important since recent ComScore research shows that more Americans are shifting their e-mail use to their mobile devices. Also, recent statistics from Nielsen indicate that U.S. mobile users spend more time on their phones doing e-mail than using Facebook. In January, Trusteer analyzed the ""log files"" (access records) of several Web servers that had hosted phishing sites. The records showed how many users accessed these nefarious sites, when they visited them, whether they entered their account login information and which devices they used to access the sites. Here's what Trusteer learned: . 1. Mobile users typically arrive first after the phishing e-mails are sent out. ""This makes sense since mobile users are 'always on' and are most likely to read e-mail messages as soon as they arrive. Meanwhile, desktop users only read messages when they have access to their computer,"" wrote Trusteer CEO Mickey Boodaei. ""Also, most fraudulent e-mails call for immediate action. For example, they usually claim that suspicious activity has been detected in the user's account and that immediate action is required. Most victims who fall for this ploy will visit the phishing site quickly."" This is crucial, since internet providers and web hosts watch for phishing-style activity on their networks and often act quickly to block phishing sites. In a Marketplace Tech Report interview, internet security expert Anup Ghosh warned that one of the most insidious parts of e-mail phishing is that the fake alert e-mail might actually say the company is notifying you in response to a recent publicized security breach -- that is, the one they perpetrated. ""It's a perfect cover,"" Ghosh noted. 2. Mobile users are three times more likely than desktop users to enter login information. The good news is that most people (mobile or not) don't enter any login information when they land on a phishing site. But among those who do, mobile users clearly were more likely to take this step into the phishing trap. 3. iPhone users are eight times more likely than BlackBerry users to access phishing sites. According to ComScore's latest figures, there are still more BlackBerry phones than iPhones in use in the U.S. market. According to Boodaei, it's ""equally difficult to spot phishing websites on BlackBerry and iPhone devices."" So why the disparity? Boodaei speculates that many BlackBerry users are business users who were issued their BlackBerry by their employer, ostensibly with at least some security training. In contrast, the iPhone is overwhelmingly a consumer device. How to protect yourself: Be skeptical of any e-mails that claim to come from companies that you do business with. Although phishing attempts are most likely immediately after a data breach, they can occur weeks or months later. So remain vigilant. Logos, e-mail addresses, and other visual clues to authenticity can be faked. Never click a link in an e-mail message that you don't trust 100%. Many web browsers (including mobile browsers) can be ""infected"" by malicious code just by accessing a website. But if you do click a link in an e-mail, make sure you never enter personal information on the resulting website. If you receive what may be a phishing attempt and have questions about whether your account may have been compromised, do this: Open a fresh Web browser window (on your computer or phone), access the real website of the company in question and log in to your account that way. Then check whether they've issued any security alerts. Or just look up the company's phone number and call them, an action that's especially easy from your mobile phone. Just make sure you don't just call whatever phone number is listed in the e-mail message. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Epsilon, the largest permissions-based e-mail marketing company, was hacked .

"(LifeWire) -- At Sara Champion's previous job as a project engineer for one of the country's top construction firms, visible tattoos for professional staff were against company policy. Sarah Champion's former employer told her that she had to conceal her tattoos while at work. She found this ironic -- not to mention frustrating -- given that her position entailed inspecting job sites filled with tattooed construction workers. ""I was out on site all day, and I wasn't allowed to show any of my tattoos,"" says the 28-year-old Florida native, whose six large tattoos on her arms and back include a brightly colored sunflower, a marigold and a rendition of a Dia de los Muertos bride and groom on her upper left arm. ""Ninety-eight degrees and long sleeves is not so cool when you're in Miami."" After six years with the construction firm, Champion decided to move north and find an employer that wouldn't needle her about her body art. She found her ""perfect job"" in Danbury, Connecticut, as a project manager at a design and branding agency. Now, ""I have no problem showing up to meet a big client in a T-shirt and jeans,"" tattoos in plain view, she says. ""I wish more companies were like this."" iReport.com: Share your tattoo stories . The times, they are not a-changing? According to a 2006 report in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 24 percent of Americans ages 18 to 50 have at least one tattoo, and 14 percent have at least one body piercing. Researchers questioned 253 women and 247 men via random telephone survey. So, does the fact that body art is as prevalent today as mullets were in the 1980s mean that the tattoo-friendly tide is turning in the workplace? ""That question is best answered by [corporate] culture and by industry,"" says Jackie Valent, director of human resources in the Milwaukee office of accounting giant Deloitte. ""If you look at a company like Google, a very entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley organization, tattoos are more acceptable."" ""But if you look at the other end of the spectrum, which is where I happen to [work],"" says the 20-year human resources veteran, ""the answer is absolutely not. If you have six piercings and a big tattoo, we're going to tell you to cover the tattoos and take out the piercings."" (For the record, a Google spokesperson said that the company does not have a policy on tattoos.) Amy Derick, a dermatologist from Barrington, Illinois and a co-author of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology study, isn't surprised that a few companies or industries are still opposed to body art. ""Eight percent of people with tattoos report trouble at work,"" from being forced to hide them to being restricted from performing certain tasks, Derick says. For example, a grocery store employee with a tattoo on their hand might be asked to perform tasks less likely to bring them into contact with the public, like stocking shelves instead of working a register. Better safe than cited . What's the solution for body art aficionados who work in one of the more conservative business sectors? Hide your body art or starve? Pretty much, says Dave Kimelberg, who photographed 15 professionals with large-scale tattoos they conceal at work for the book ""INKED Inc."" and runs InkedInc.com, a related Web site. ""I think in some ways, it's a 'don't ask, don't tell' understanding,"" says the 37-year-old Boston lawyer, who works as general counsel for a venture capital firm. ""There's kind of this Superman element to it, like this crazy blue and red skin-tight suit underneath my Clark Kent exterior."" Like many of the secretly inked doctors, lawyers, and architects he's met over the years, Kimelberg sticks to tattoos he can easily conceal under clothing at work -- in his case, three-quarter ""ink sleeves"" that extend from each shoulder to the middle of his forearms but allow him to roll up his shirt sleeves on warm days. And while the ink's out of the bag now that Kimelberg's published his book, he still keeps his tats under wraps for fear of them being ""a distraction in the workplace."" The same goes for Kasey Broach, a public relations specialist at a Phoenix law firm. To commemorate turning 25 and getting her MBA this year, she got a small omega symbol tattooed at the base of her neck in ultraviolet ink, which can only be seen with a black light. ""No one knows about it unless I show them,"" she says. ""I have to bring the black light out from my high school years."" Where the body art roams . But what if you're not a doctor, lawyer, or accountant, but a creative type determined to find a job where you can bare your body ink? That's when it's time to play detective, says career coach Janet Scarborough Civitelli. ""Visit the employee parking lot to see how they are dressed and whether many of the employees have visible tattoos,"" says the psychologist and founder of Bridgeway Career Development, a career counseling firm in Seattle. ""Also ask colleagues and friends if they know anyone who works there who can give you some insider info."" ""The Web is also a gold mine of information,"" she says, adding that the Web site ModifiedMind.com, which is dedicated to body art and other modifications, features a database of companies reportedly open to tattoos. Then again, if a no-tattoo policy is your deal breaker, you could take a gamble like Sara Champion did during the interview for her current position: . ""I said, 'Are you tattoo friendly?'"" Fortunately, the answer was yes. LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

"(CNN) -- ""My beat is looking for ways to create a future which is sustainable, dynamic, prosperous and fair -- a future which is both bright and green."" Alex Steffen, eco-crusader and founder of Seattle-based environmental Web site Worldchanging.com, wants to save the world; and he thinks we've got 25 years to do it. Alex Steffen, founder of Worldchanging.com . ""Our climate is ripping apart at the seams at a rate that's surprising even the so-called alarmists,"" he writes. ""Natural systems are collapsing. The ocean seems headed towards a series of catastrophic tipping points. Economic inequity is producing a planet of billionaires and a billion desperate people."" Steffen says the world's challenge stems from the inherently unsustainable systems embedded in our culture. He quotes statistics that say we're each using 2.3 hectares of land to support ourselves, instead of the 1.9 per person available. But, he adds, we're not sharing the world's resources fairly. ""The average American uses nearly 10 hectares, the average Chinese uses only about one and a half, while the average Pakistani has only about 6/10 of a hectare,"" he says. Steffen and his friends were hanging out one day, talking about how potentially world-changing solutions weren't getting media coverage. As Steffen said to CNN, ""There was plenty of space for talking about what was going wrong, but very little for talking about how to make things go better."" So they decided to do something about it. ""We decided that -- as a little bit of a hobby project really -- we'd start a blog called Worldchanging and note all the various solutions we found that we thought were interesting."" Within six months, the site was so successful that Steffen had to give up his day job. Three and a half years later, Worldchanging.com is one of the most popular environmental campaigning sites on the Internet and has led to the publication of a successful companion book, ""Worldchanging: A User's Guide to the 21st Century."" The site -- and the book -- cover all aspects of sustainability, from living spaces to locally-produced food to green advocacy, and focuses on cutting-edge developments. Steffen's team of writers, a mixture of journalists, scientists, architects, academics and designers, share his passion for positive thinking. ""It's really a kind of fun, amorphous group. It's almost more of a tribe than a business in some ways,"" he told CNN. And they pull no punches when it comes to the future of the planet. Steffen is bold enough to state the harsh truths that refusing a plastic bag, turning the TV off standby or switching to a duel-fuel car isn't enough to turn things around. He's frustrated by the rise of the eco-consumer and its embracement by the media, which he describes as ""muddle-headed, style-over-substance, 'lite green' environmentalism."" He calls this ""greenwashing."" ""We don't need more carpool lanes. We need to eliminate fossil fuels from our economy,"" he writes. ""We don't need more recycling bins. We need to create a closed-loop, biomimetic, neobiological industrial system. We don't need to attend a tree-planting ceremony. We need to become expert at ecosystem management and gardening the planet... We need a bright green revolution."" This might sound extreme, but Steffen is in touch with a large audience who share his beliefs and his vision for the future. He describes them as ""some of the best people -- people who really care and are working really hard to try and make a difference."" And Steffen's lasting message is that each one of us can -- and should -- make that difference. He says, ""Fundamentally, sustainability is a small problem writ big by six billion people. Each of us has a part to play on that team in making this new society possible."" ................................................... What do you think of Alex Steffen's vision?

"(Mashable)  -- South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook -- the director of 2003's critically acclaimed ""Oldboy"" -- says his new film was shot entirely on the iPhone. The fantasy-horror film ""Paranmanjang,"" which means ""life full of ups and downs"" in Korean, is about half an hour long, and was made on a budget of 150 million won ($133,000). According to the Associated Press, Park says the iPhone's small size and light weight, as well as the fact that ""anyone can use it,"" made it a good tool. His brother, Park Chan-kyong -- also a director who collaborated on the film -- says a wide variety of camera angles and edits were possible because a number of cameras could be used. Park Chan-wook is one of the best-known filmmakers in South Korea, where his iPhone-directed film is set to hit theaters on January 27. In addition to helming the previously mentioned ""Oldboy,"" he also directed ""Cut"" in the horror collaboration ""Three... Extremes,"" as well as longer films like ""Lady Vengeance"" and ""Thirst."" Park is not the first South Korean filmmaker to shoot a project with the iPhone 4. As The Wall Street Journal points out, KT Corp. -- the iPhone distributor in South Korea -- sponsored a film festival, featuring 12 short movies made with the iPhone 4, last October. KT Corp. also helped with some of the production costs for Paranmanjang. The practice of using phones to shoot videos -- other than home movies uploaded to YouTube -- seems to have become a bit of a trend in recent months. The iPhone 4 has been used to shoot music videos, while generally striking a chord with those who do not have access to big budgets. Meanwhile, the Nokia N8 was used to shoot ""The Commuter,"" a seven-and-a-half minute flick starring Dev Patel and Pamela Anderson. It will be interesting to see what effect such efforts will have on both mainstream and independent filmmaking in the future. Â© 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- A gunman killed three people and wounded at least five at the house of a mayoral candidate in the Philippines before polls opened on Monday, a military spokeswoman said. The attack happened around 2:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. Sunday ET) when an unidentified gunman raided the house of a mayoral candidate in Zamboanga del Sur province, said spokeswoman Steffani Cacho. The incident is under investigation, she added. More than 50 million ballots have been printed with a dizzying number of candidates to choose from -- nine for president alone, among them front-runner Sen. Benigno Aquino III, son of a former president; and Joseph Estrada, a former president himself. Family dynasties also play a role: Former first lady Imelda Marcos is running to fill the Congressional seat of her son, Ferdinand ""Bongbong,"" who is running for Senate, while her Congresswoman daughter Imee is running for governor. Boxing champion Manny Pacquiao also threw his hat in the ring: He's running for Congress too. In all. voters must fill some 17,000 other positions at the executive, legislative and local levels. A faulty test run of automated machines raised questions as late as Wednesday of whether the elections would even happen. A postponement would have stirred fears of a power vacuum on June 30 when President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is scheduled to end her nine years in office. Polls opened to crowds of waiting voters, CNN's Arwa Damon reported from Manila. ""People are very excited,"" Damon said, adding that the election-day mood was ""tinged with anxiety."" Polls were scheduled to remain open until 6 p.m. local time (10 a.m. GMT). ""It's a very crucial litmus test to our democracy, our fragile democracy,"" said Leila De Lima, chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines, which will be serving as an independent election monitor. ""The administration has been hounded by issues of corruption, human rights violations. People are looking forward to a new administration that will hopefully usher in meaningful changes. So, it's very, very important."" ""The right of suffrage is a fundamental human right,"" she added. The Philippine National Police (PNP) has been placed on nationwide full alert since last week, with all leaves canceled, and all 130,000 officers required to report for duty. An election ban on liquor sales and public consumption went into effect Sunday, with violators subject to one to six years in prison. Exemptions are made for hotels and tourist-oriented establishments with prior approval. A nationwide gun ban has already been in force since January 10 at the start of the election period. Vote buying is ""currently the most common form of cheating,"" the PNP quoted its chief and director-general Jesus Verzosa as saying. Whereas in the past, people were paid to vote, this time they are paid to waive their right to vote and have their index fingers marked with ink, making them ineligible, according to PNP. Reports indicated some candidates were willing to pay identified supporters of their opponents not to vote, the PNP said on its Web site. The proliferation of guns and private armies, particularly those attached to political families, has contributed to a violent atmosphere, particularly in the country's southern province of Maguindanao, where 57 people were massacred in November. The transparency of the election process also has also been called into question. Election watchdog group Kontra Daya on Saturday condemned the Commission on Elections' approval of presidential son Juan Miguel Arroyo as first nominee of a political party made up entirely of security guards. The party is running as one of 187 ""party-list groups"" that are designated as marginalized and underrepresented and would together comprise one-fifth of the House of Representatives. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video . Last month Kontra Daya identified 40 questionable party-list groups, showing their links to various people in the Arroyo administration or the president's family, including her sister-in-law, who represents a party of small entrepreneurs. Not to be outdone is the inclusion on millions of ballots of a person whose name may appear at the top of the list of presidential candidates -- and above Aquino's -- despite being disqualified in March: Vetellano Acosta. The Commission on Elections said Acosta, who is listed under the ""KBL"" party founded by Ferdinand Marcos, would remain on the ballot because so many ballots had already been printed. CNN's Elizabeth Yuan contributed to this report.","NEW: Killing of three people at mayoral candidate's house under investigation .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has expressed regret over a NATO air strike earlier in the week that resulted in the deaths of nine Afghan boys, according to a White House statement released Thursday. The president, during a video teleconference Wednesday with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, indicated his ""deep regret for the tragic accident in Kunar Province,"" the statement said.  Obama ""conveyed his condolences to the Afghan people and stressed that he and (top American commander Gen. David) Petraeus take such incidents very seriously."" Obama and Karzai ""agreed that such incidents undermine our shared efforts in fighting terrorism,"" the statement said. U.S. Lt. General David Rodriguez released a video statement earlier Thursday describing the incident.  Rodriguez said that on Tuesday, insurgents in mountains above a coalition base launched a rocket attack that wounded a U.S. civilian. Troops returned fire, and insurgents later shot another rocket at the troops. Two attack helicopters flew to the location where ""they were told the rockets came from,"" identified who they thought were insurgents and killed nine people. Later, they found that the slain people were boys cutting wood. Rodriguez called the incident ""a terrible mistake"" and promised disciplinary action if warranted. Civilian casualties during warfare in Afghanistan have hurt NATO's International Security Assistance Force.  The statements from top U.S. officials reflect the high priority coalition leaders place on avoiding such accidents. Rodriguez said such incidents are ""rare"" when considering all of the operations the coalition undertakes.  He said a lot of time is spent training soldiers on how to ""engage the right targets,"" and directives are constantly reviewed. ""We have done much better preventing civilian casualties,"" he said. ""But we acknowledge we have to do better."" Rodriguez said the military understands families' grief over such deaths, and he said soldiers ""feel worse than they can express"" when they ""do something terrible like mistakenly killing young boys."" ""They have to live with that for the rest of their lives,"" he said. Rodriguez also urged Afghans to help their security forces battle insurgents. His statement followed a public apology Wednesday from Petraeus. ""We are deeply sorry for this tragedy and apologize to the members of the Afghan government, the people of Afghanistan, and, most importantly, the surviving family members of those killed by our actions,"" Petraeus said. ""Regrettably, there appears to have been an error in the hand-off between identifying the location of the insurgents and the attack helicopters that carried out the subsequent operations."" Karzai condemned the incident ""in the strongest terms possible."" He noted the incident occurred less than 10 days after another incident ""that left many civilians dead in the same province."" On February 20, Kunar Gov. Sayed Fazlullah Wahidi said 64 civilians had died in a joint operation by ISAF and Afghan security forces over several days. The dead included 20 women and 15 children, he said. Petraeus recently directed military commanders in Afghanistan to review changes meant to minimize civilian casualties. He has ordered commanders to brief helicopter attack crews again on the changes, he said.","NEW: Obama expresses regret for the deaths of the Afghan boys .

"(CNN) -- He didn't win, but Tiger Woods showed why he is still the No. 1 drawcard in golf with a brave bid for victory at The Barclays tournament Sunday. He had been tied for the lead after three birdies on his opening nine holes, but a recurrence of his back injury seemed to have scuppered his chances of a sixth PGA Tour title this season. The American crumpled to his knees in pain after sending an approach shot into the murky water hazard at 13, and he registered a bogey before dropping another shot at 15. However, he birdied the next two holes to give himself a chance of a playoff against clubhouse leader Adam Scott, but his 27-foot putt from the fringe stopped an inch short of the hole. A grim-faced Woods received a standing ovation from the gallery crowd at Liberty National in Jersey City, before explaining how his back had gone into ""spasm"" even before the 13th. The problem started before the tournament, caused by a ""too soft"" mattress at the hotel where he was staying. ""I had a chance. I hit a good putt. I thought I made it. It was a little double-breaker and I thought I had it,"" said the 37-year-old, who remained top of the FedEx Cup playoff standings after finishing tied for second with U.S. Open winner Justin Rose, Canada's Graham DeLaet and American Gary Woodland. Rose could also have made a playoff, but surprisingly three-putted at the last for bogey and a final round of three-under 68. Woodland also had a chance, but the joint third-round leader could only par as he closed with a disappointing 73. DeLaet surged up the leaderboard with a seven-birdie 65, but it was not enough to beat Scott as the Masters champion prevailed on 11-under after a flawless 66 to claim the $1.44 million first prize. Scott, whose caddy Steve Williams helped Woods to many of his successes, said his turning point had been three late birdies on Saturday. ""I'd been playing like a dog,"" he said. ""I don't know if it's been my best golf since the Masters, but I played consistently well to win here."" Scott, who also had top-five finishes at the British Open and PGA Championship, moved up to second in the FedEx Cup standings ahead of the next event in Boston -- the Deutsche Bank Championship this coming week, which features the top 100 players. British Open champion Phil Mickelson finished two shots off the Australian on 275 following his 65, which left him tied for sixth with fellow Americans D.A. Points and Jim Furyk. The veteran left-hander moved up to third in the playoff standings. Matt Kuchar, who won the tournament in 2010, dropped back from sharing the third-round lead to a tie for 19th. His birdie at the last was mere consolation after a triple-bogey seven at the ninth and five other dropped holes. The 35-year-old slumped to fifth in the standings, from second.","Adam Scott wins The Barclays by one shot after a dramatic final round .

"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (CNN) -- Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee announced Friday. Confetti flies in Rio de Janeiro after the IOC announces the city will host the 2016 games. The announcement brought tears to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who dabbed his eyes with a handkerchief several times in a news conference afterward. ""Our hour has arrived,"" he said. ""It has arrived."" In Rio, jubilation erupted at the world-famous Copacabana beach, where thousands of people gathered to hear the announcement. Rio organizers promised to start working immediately to make the games a success. ""Maybe some of the people tomorrow can rest,"" said Rio 2016 President Carlos Nuzman. ""I'm not [resting]."" Rio beat Madrid, Spain, in the final round. Chicago, Illinois, and Tokyo, Japan, were eliminated in earlier rounds. For Rio, a major appeal was bringing the Olympics to South America for the first time. IOC President Jacques Rogge said in the news conference afterward that in addition to its excellent bid, Rio had the ""extra added value of going for the first time to a continent that's never had the games."" He also noted that Brazil helped its chances this year when it did not get the 2012 games awarded four years ago. ""Rio remained humble,"" he said. ""They wanted to listen, to repair their shortcomings."" More than half of Rio's Olympic venues are built, including state-of-the-art facilities constructed for the 2007 Pan and Parapan American Games: the magnificent Joao Havelange Stadium (the proposed 2016 venue for athletics), the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center, the Rio Olympic Arena (which will host gymnastics and wheelchair basketball), the Rio Olympic Velodrome, the National Equestrian Center and its close neighbor, the National Shooting Center. Rio will hold the games from August 5-21 and its theme will be ""Live your passion.""  Watch Brazil delegation celebrate as Rio is announced winner Â» . According to Rio's bid, the games will be held in four zones with varying socioeconomic characteristics: . â¢ Barra, the heart of the games, is an expanding area of Rio that will require ""considerable infrastructure and accommodation development."" It will house the Olympic and media villages and some venues. â¢ Copacabana, a world-famous beach and major tourist attraction, will host outdoor sports in temporary venues. â¢ Maracana, the most densely populated of the zones, will contain an athletic stadium and the Maracana Stadium, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies. Major redevelopment is planned for the zone. â¢ Deodoro has little infrastructure, but the highest proportion of young people. It will require construction of Olympic venues. The city's bid was helped by a strong economy and guaranteed funding. Brazil's economy is the 10th largest in the world and predicted to be fifth by 2016. Brazil told the IOC its commitment to the Olympics could be seen in the  investment already under way in Rio. Maracana Stadium will close next year for two years of refurbishment. The areas around it will be renovated, with improved access and transportation links. The entire neighborhood will be reborn, the Rio committee said, to host the final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Work is already under way on the ongoing development of the Olympic Training Center, which includes many of the state-of-the-art venues built for the 2007 Pan and Parapan American Games. This was Madrid's third attempt at hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Summer Games. Madrid presented a ""very capable"" bid, with good transportation infrastructure and a number of venues already in place, said Ed Hula, editor of the Olympics Web site Around the Rings.  Watch Madrid celebrate making it to final round Â» . Madrid's chances might have been hampered, however, by a recent tradition that consecutive Summer Olympics aren't staged on the same continent. The London, England, 2012 Olympics will have happened just four years before 2016. ""Although there's no rule against it, the IOC has yet to award consecutive summer games to the same continent since 1952 in Helsinki,"" Hula said. Chicago was the first city to be eliminated. The announcement -- unexpected by many -- came just hours after President Obama and his wife, Michelle, delivered personal pleas to the Olympic committee praising the virtues of their home city.  Watch Obama makes his pitch to IOC Â» . ""You can play a great game and still not win,"" Obama said after returning to the White House. ""Although I wish we had come back with better news ... I could not be prouder of my hometown."" Obama said he believed Chicago had made ""the strongest bid possible."" ""I'm totally stunned. I thought we had a great opportunity,"" said former NBA great Michael Jordan. Jordan, who led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles, said the city would have been ""perfect for the world to explore."" He said Chicago is ""deserving of an event of that magnitude"" and hopes it will try again. U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, a Chicago Democrat, said the loss is ""kind of heartbreaking. ... A tremendous amount of effort has been put into trying to win the bid."" The response around the city was not all negative, however. Many residents are ""almost glad the distraction of the Olympics"" won't be there, noted CNN's Ali Velshi, who was in downtown Chicago when the news was announced. Many residents feel it will allow local political and business leaders to ""focus attention back on what Chicago needs to do,"" Velshi said. Obama, the first U.S. president to make an Olympic bid in person, was flying back to Washington when the announcement was made. He was disappointed with the outcome but not sorry he made the trip to Copenhagen, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. The heads of state for the other three finalists also made personal pitches. Spain's King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia and Spanish President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero pushed the case for Madrid. Recently elected Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama made a bid for Tokyo. Brazilian President Lula da Silva was joined by soccer legend and Brazilian native PelÃ© as they advertised the benefits of a Rio games. An animated Lula da Silva, surrounded by Rio supporters, said at a news conference after the announcement, ""Among the 10 major economies of the world, Brazil was the only country that had not received the Olympic and Paralympic Games. For us, it will hardly be our last Olympics. For us, it will be an opportunity to be equal. It will increase self-esteem for Brazilians, will consolidate recent conquests and stimulate new advances.""","International Olympic Committee names Rio de Janeiro as host of 2016 games .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Geeta was 9 when she began wearing makeup, staying up until 2 a.m. and having sex with as many as 60 men a day. ""I used to be really sad and frustrated with what was happening in my life,"" she said. The daughter of Nepalese peasant farmers, Geeta -- now 26 -- had been sold to a brothel in India by a member of her extended family. The family member had duped Geeta's visually impaired mother into believing her daughter would get work at a clothing company in Nepal. ""The brothel where I was ... there [were] many customers coming in every day. The owner used to verbally abuse us, and if we didn't comply, [she] would start beating us with wires, rods and hot spoons."" It was not until Geeta was 14 that a police officer rescued her and brought her to a safe house compound run by Anuradha Koirala. The 61-year-old woman and her group, Maiti Nepal, have been fighting for more than 16 years to rescue and rehabilitate thousands of Nepal's sex trafficking victims. ""Families are tricked all the time,"" said Koirala. ""The trafficking of the girls is done by people who are basically known to the girls, who can lure them from the village by telling them they are getting a nice job. It's a lucrative business."" By raiding brothels, patrolling the India-Nepal border and providing safe shelter and support services, Koirala and Maiti Nepal have helped rescue and rehabilitate more than 12,000 Nepali women and girls since 1993. Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero? Nominations are open now . According to the U.S. State Department, some 10,000 to 15,000 women and girls from Nepal are trafficked to India and then sexually exploited each year. Koirala's own history in an abusive relationship led her to her crusade. For most of her young adulthood, she taught primary school English in Nepal. But when her relationship took a violent turn, her life's ""purpose and responsibility completely changed,"" she said. ""Every day, there was battering. And then I had three miscarriages that I think [were] from the beating. It was very difficult because I didn't know in those days where to go and report [it], who to ... talk to."" After the relationship ended, Koirala used a portion of her $100 monthly salary to start a small retail shop to employ and support displaced victims of sex trafficking and domestic violence. By the early 1990s, an increasing demand for help and persistent cases of violence against women compelled Koirala to do more. Maiti Nepal was her brainchild for giving voice, legal defense and rehabilitation to victims of sex trafficking. Roughly translated, Maiti means ""Mother's Home."" The group has facilities throughout Nepal and India, but most of the rehabilitation work takes place at its main campus in Kathmandu, Nepal. Koirala said girls from the brothels arrive empty-handed, sick, in many cases pregnant or with small children, and ""psychologically broken."" ""When the girl first comes to Maiti Nepal, we never, never ask them a question. We just let them [be] for as long as they need. We let them play, dance, walk, talk to a friend,"" Koirala said. ""They are afraid at first, but eventually they will talk to us on their own."" The group also takes in rape and domestic violence survivors, as well as abandoned children. ""I cannot say no to anybody,"" Koirala said. ""Everybody comes to Maiti Nepal."" Accommodating its population of close to 400 women and children requires a large staff of teachers, counselors and medical personnel -- and dozens of bunk beds. Many of the staff are sex trafficking survivors now committed to helping rehabilitate other girls. The work is funded by grants and donations from around the world. Post-rescue recovery is comprehensive. Maiti Nepal provides medical treatment, psychological and legal counseling, formal court filings and criminal prosecution, all for free. While some of the girls are able to return to their families, many of them -- particularly those with HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases -- become socially stigmatized and are no longer welcome in their home communities. For these girls, Maiti Nepal becomes their new, and possibly last, home. A hospice on the compound's grounds houses terminally ill patients. ""The hardest part for me is to see a girl dying or coming back with different diseases at an [age] when she should be out frolicking,"" Koirala said. ""That's what fuels me to work harder."" The group's ultimate goal is to help girls become economically independent and reintegrated into society. ""We try to give them whatever work they want to do, whatever training they want to do, because when you're economically empowered, people forget everything. People even forget [she is] HIV-positive or was trafficked,"" Koirala said. Koirala and at least 50 trafficking survivors also participate in what she calls social preventive work outside the campus. Their community awareness camps educate families in rural villages and city slums about the dangers of sex trafficking, and a daily patrol at crossing points along the India-Nepal border successfully rescues an average of four Nepali girls a day. ""Our girls are border guards who have been trafficked themselves. They easily recognize a girl that is being trafficked or will be trafficked,"" Koirala said. ""The girls need no motivation from me. They know the horrors of the brothel, and they are here to save their sisters."" Some girls who are trafficked choose to remain prostitutes for life because their home villages will not accept them. But Koirala says that among those rescued by Maiti Nepal, there isn't a single case when a girl has returned back to the streets. Geeta's recovery is one of the group's success stories. Today, she works at Maiti Nepal as a peer educator and also helps with the group's awareness camps. She credits Koirala and Maiti Nepal for the strength to keep living and the confidence to join the fight against sex trafficking. ""Anuradha is a hero. ... She's courageous,"" Geeta said. ""She gave me my faith back. ... If Maiti Nepal wasn't there for me, I would be dead by now."" Want to get involved? Check out the Maiti Nepal website and see how to help.

"(CNN) -- South Africa -- it's the part of the continent most of us know at least a little about. Now almost two decades removed from apartheid, the country at the bottom of the continent has taken up the place it deserves as one of Africa's top tourist destinations. The country of approximately 52 million people is already well known for Cape Town, Table Mountain, the wine route and game viewing in the Kruger National Park. But there's much more to discover. More: 26 most stunning spots in Africa . 1. KwaZulu-Natal province inspired one of the world's best-selling albums . Paul Simon introduced the world to isicathamiya music, a form of Zulu a cappella, when he teamed up with Ladysmith Black Mambazo for his album ""Graceland."" Named after the KwaZulu-Natal town they come from, Ladysmith Black Mambazo is but one of hundreds of similar groups that can be seen and heard performing regularly at shows that resemble sporting competitions. Often involving as many as 30 groups, these competitions usually take place in large cities, such as Johannesburg and Durban, starting on a Saturday night and carrying on until well after the sun comes up on Sunday morning. 2. Hippos eat lawns in downtown St. Lucia . The town of St. Lucia sits in the middle of iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a subtropical estuary that's part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Chances of getting mugged or hijacked are virtually nil, but chances of meeting a hippo while walking to dinner are high. The estuary contains one of the largest concentrations of hippos in the world. In the evenings, when the sun goes down, they walk into town to munch on lawns in the residential areas.

It's a common misconception among tourists who trek to the Cape of Good Hope and climb the steps to the lighthouse to assume there's no land between them and Antarctica. It certainly looks that way from this magnificent viewpoint. Except for the inconvenient fact that those truly wishing to be at the bottom of Africa have to travel about another 170 kilometers southeast to the rocky outcrop at Cape Agulhas. One more myth to bust: The Indian and Atlantic oceans don't meet at Cape Point, they meet at Cape Agulhas. 4. There's 'summer' skiing . Yes, there's downhill skiing in South Africa. In fact, there's downhill skiing in two countries in southern Africa: South Africa and neighboring Lesotho. Tiffendell Ski Resort in South Africa's Eastern Cape Highlands and Afriski in Lesotho's Maluti Mountains (both ranges are part of what's more widely known as the Drakensberg Mountains) offer a relatively short season running between June and August, the Southern Hemisphere winter. Runs aren't long -- about a kilometer in total at each resort -- but there's real snow and when there isn't enough falling from the sky, both Afriski and Tiffendell have snow-making equipment. More: Safari pioneer Geoffrey Kent's incredible African odyssey . 5. One street, two Nobel Peace Prize winners . Vilakazi Street punches way above its weight. Before the arrival of democracy in South Africa, Vilakazi Street looked like any other nondescript dusty street full of matchbox houses in Soweto, near Johannesburg. But for decades it has been different from its neighbors; it has been and remains a place of pilgrimage as the only street in the world that has been home to two Nobel Peace Prize winners. Former South African President Nelson Mandela and former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu lived a few doors from each other on Vilakazi Street. Tutu and his wife, Leah, still live there. Mandela's house is now a National Historical site and open to the public as a museum. Vilakazi Street is no longer dusty. The gravel has been replaced by pavement and brick sidewalks and the new neighbors include restaurants, bars and local craft sellers. 6. There's a space shuttle emergency landing strip in the Kalahari Desert . Upington is perhaps the world's most over-achieving small town. It has a population of just around 75,000 and most South Africans have never been there, but it bills itself as the capital of the Green Kalahari, a setting similar to Cairo on the Nile. At 4.9 kilometers, the local airport runway is one of the longest in the world and was designated an emergency landing area for the space shuttle should it have had to make an unscheduled landing in southern Africa. Upington Airport is also the final resting place for numerous commercial aircraft; the dry air helps preserve them in case they're ever called into service again. The Orange River, South Africa's largest, winds through the city, creating a greenbelt that only just manages to keep the Kalahari Desert at bay. More: 9 top South African spiritual retreats . 7. Once you remove the quills, porcupine skin is delicious . Finding traditional dishes that originate in South Africa is a tall order (much of the cuisine is a product of mixing cultures). But C. Louis Leipoldt, a sort of Renaissance man from the early 20th century, made it one of his lifelong pursuits. The smallest villages in the Western Cape still try to whip up some of his more famous recipes when the ingredients are available. Porcupine crackling is one of them. From his Cape Cookery book, Leipoldt's preparation instructions call for plunging the animal into boiling water, scraping off the quills and hairs, scrubbing the skin until it's perfectly smooth and white and then discarding the meat, which, he says, isn't very nice to eat. 8. It's the site of Britain's most shocking military defeat . In early 1879 the British army had state of the art equipment. Commander-in-Chief Lord Chelmsford thought the barefoot, spear-wielding Zulu forces he was about to attack in what is today the central part of KwaZulu-Natal province would be a walkover. What he didn't count on was the technique used by the Zulu troops under King Cetshwayo. In a formation representing the horns and chest of a buffalo, and using short, thrusting spears, the Zulus overwhelmed the British; more than 1,300 of the 1,800 troops the British brought into battle were dead at the end of the day. The battle is re-enacted regularly and the site at Isandlwana is well maintained with accommodations nearby. 9. SKA isn't music, it's a telescope . Ska is the roots of reggae music that began in Jamaica. SKA is the Square Kilometer Array, a giant radio telescope being built in the Karoo, a large, semi-desert that fills much of the southwestern part of the country. The Karoo is located in one of the most remote corners of South Africa. The place is extremely quiet and there's no artificial light nearby. The SKA telescope will one day look into the universe and collect data 10,000 times faster than has ever been done before. Covering a square kilometer, the infrastructure won't be completed for another decade. It's hoped that this multinational megaproject will help us understand where the universe has come from as well as where it's going. More: Zimbabwe proposes Disneyland in Africa . 10. You can have a drink inside a tree . Africa's biggest and oldest trees, baobabs, are found in one of South Africa's driest regions, Limpopo province. Also known as cream of tartar trees, monkey-bread trees and upside-down trees, kids know them from the ""Madagascar"" films. The pulp from the tree contains citric and tartaric acids used as common baking ingredients. The seeds can be roasted and turned into oil and the fruit is used to make a lemonade-type drink. Limpopo province is home to a hauntingly beautiful forest of the trees near the border of Zimbabwe. The tree that locals claim is the largest baobab in the world is in nearby Modjadjiskloof.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Israeli rescuers pulled a 22-year-old man from the ruins of a three-story building on Friday, 10 days after the massive earthquake killed tens of thousands of people. The man, who was not immediately identified, was rescued near the quake-ravaged presidential residence south of the capital, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Maj. Zohar Moshe said American and French doctors asked for the Israeli team's assistance after trying to rescue the trapped man themselves. The rescuers ""were able to release him whole and healthy"" and take him to an IDF field hospital in stable condition for further treatment,"" he said. Rescuers continue efforts to find survivors who have defied the odds, including a 7-year-old boy and 11-year-old girl who were found Tuesday. Another 5-year-old boy, Monley, was pulled alive from rubble nearly eight days after the 7.0-magnitude quake had leveled much of Port-au-Prince. More than 121 people have been pulled alive from the rubble, the United Nations said this week. Fires are expected to flare up in the quake's aftermath, from broken mains and other damage. A massive blaze consumed a textile factory in Port-au-Prince Friday night as U.N. workers tried to contain the flames and spare nearby buildings. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Meanwhile, aftershocks from the 7.0-magnitude quake have become a way of life for people here as they spend their days searching for food, water and shelter. Haitians brace for each aftershock as they wait for supplies and sustenance to reach them. More than $355 million in donations in the United States alone has been raised for the relief effort, but stacks of aid -- baby formula, pain medication, antibiotics and other much-needed supplies -- are sitting on the tarmac and in warehouses at the airport in Port-au-Prince, the capital. What is reaching the hands of survivors is getting there at a snail's pace. ""It's a shame, because you would hope that everything could get out there within seconds,"" Air Force Col. Ben McMullen told CNN's chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, at the airport. ""But that kind of infrastructure just isn't in place."" Full coverage | Twitter updates . Each new aftershock -- smaller earthquakes that follow a more powerful one -- slows down the relief effort even further. Friday morning's 4.4-magnitude quake was much less powerful than the 7.0-magnitude one that struck January 12, leaving widespread death and destruction in its wake. A 5.9-magnitude earthquake Wednesday was the strongest aftershock of the week -- enough to cause considerable damage, the U.S. Geological Survey said, though the extent of damage that any earthquake causes depends on factors such as its depth, its proximity to dense population centers and the strength of structures where it hits. An American adoption service provider in Haiti wrote in a blog that the aftershock Wednesday sent ""a wall tumbling down on our heads."" Save the Children said its staff ""heard already-weakened structures collapsing"" as a result. Still, the 7.0-magnitude quake was more than 40 times stronger than the 5.9-magnitude aftershock, researchers said. The death toll is estimated at 200,000, according to the European Union, whose commissioner for development and humanitarian aid, Karel De Gucht, got a firsthand view of the situation in Port-au-Prince this week. About 250,000 people are in urgent need of aid and another 3 million have been affected, the EU reported. Despite all the obstacles, some progress was made Friday. The city's south pier was operating, though slowly. Authorities pushed Friday to get operations moving faster at the port. The north pier remained unusable, and the south pier is the smaller of the two. In addition to the aftershocks, bottlenecks at all points of entry -- the airport, roads and ports -- have delayed food and medical aid to the estimated 3 million Haitians affected by the quake. Canadian troops have been working to open an airport in Jacmel, a seaside town about 8 miles from Port-au-Prince. About 120 to 140 flights a day were coming into the single-runway Port-au-Prince airport, compared with 25 a day just after the quake struck last week. But there was still a long list of flights waiting to come in, Lt. Gen. Douglas Fraser of the U.S. Southern Command said Thursday. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? To improve air traffic, the U.S. military said Wednesday it had obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic's air base at San Isidro, about 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of Port-au-Prince. Dominican troops will start patrolling a critical corridor between Jimani and Port-au-Prince, the United Nations said. The patrol should speed the delivery aid into Haiti, it said. In the meantime, working under adverse conditions with limited supplies, medical teams have been forced to improvise. Renzo Fricke, field coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said this week staffers had to buy a saw in the market so surgeons could do amputations. A CNN crew loaned a medic a pocketknife for another operation. Lacking rubbing alcohol, doctors have used vodka to sterilize equipment and instruments. Surgical patients are receiving over-the-counter pain medicine because doctors lack stronger medication. One nurse used a string of Christmas lights as a makeshift extension cord. The USNS Comfort, a U.S. naval hospital off the coast, received about 240 patients over 36 hours, said Capt. James Ware, the commanding officer. ""Most of those individuals are critical care types of injuries,"" he told CNN's ""American Morning."" Virtually all are being brought to the ship by air. The ship has 80 doctors, including 24 surgeons, and 140 nurses, he said. ""I think when we're totally mature, which will be in the next two to three days, we believe that we'll be able to push about 150 patients through to the ship and off the ship every day for surgical care, and the government of Haiti is giving us guidance exactly on where those patients will receive their follow-on care,"" he said, adding that officials hope the international community and the United Nations will oversee that process. More than 300 aid distribution sites are up and running, a senior U.S. administration official said. More than 700,000 meals and 1.4 million bottles of water have been delivered, along with 22,000 pounds of medical supplies, Fraser said. Impact Your World . Puerto Rico's 250-feet long, 80-feet wide Barge of Hope -- loaded five pallets high with food and water, medical supplies, generators and sundries -- set sail Friday afternoon. Puerto Rican authorities say that when it arrives in Haiti on Monday morning, it will be the single largest shipment of aid to arrive there to date. The roughly 4 million pounds of food are enough to feed the people of Port-au-Prince for a week. Organizers say it would take 150 planes to carry as much cargo. A group of rescuers told CNN Friday that each rescue gives them hope to keep working. ""Every time we find a live victim that's the energy that keeps us going to the next day,"" said Capt. Louis Fernandez of Miami-Dade Urban Search and Rescue. ""These are some of the harshest conditions I've ever seen,"" he said, adding, ""Nothing has ever prepared us for what we've seen here this week."" At least 9,288 Americans and some of their family members in Haiti have been evacuated, according to the U.S. State Department, though the whereabouts of nearly 5,000 other Americans remain unknown. Some 75 others from the United States -- including five government officials -- are either confirmed or presumed dead.

"(CNN) -- The future in video games is usually depicted in one of two ways. There is the techno version of the future, filled with personal electronic implants, space travel and laser weapons. Or there is the apocalyptic version, where a world has been bombed back into the Stone Age -- and somehow still has laser weapons. ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II,"" the first-person shooter game that hit stores Tuesday, transports players into two separate time periods: the 1980s and the not-so-distant future of 2025. The relatively narrow time lapse was necessary to build a story around a new villain, Raul Menendez, a terrorist bent on revenge against a world he feels has wronged him. The battles in the 1980s will use traditional weaponry expected for the time. However, Treyarch Studio Head Mark Lamia said the bigger challenge for the game's developers was creating futuristic tech for 2025 that would be both recognizable and unpredictable. ""Once you go beyond 10 years out, I think there is quite a bit of discussion about what does this mean, where do energy weapons come into play, where does (artificial intelligence) and advanced robotics go?"" Lamia said. The game is a sequel to 2010's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops,"" which sold more than 13.7 million units in the U.S. alone to become one of the best-selling console games of all time. For the new game, creators tapped author Peter Singer to help them imagine and design a world not too unlike the present day, but with a feel of advancement. Singer is a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution whose book, ""Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century,"" projected a vision of the future of war that developers were seeking. Singer told CNN he tried to identify key trends happening right now to help writers build a narrative for the new ""Call of Duty"" game. ""We focused on everything from technical trends, the emergence of robotics, some of the greater attention to warfare, and then also political trends,"" Singer said. ""The potential emergence of a proto-Cold War between the [United States] and China."" The two superpowers are competing over a valuable new resource -- the rare earth elements used in the construction of nearly all smartphones, tablets and other electronic gadgets. Singer suggested this dwindling supply of rare earth elements could be a feasible backdrop for a new Cold War. ""I was not aware of the significance of them and we all educated ourselves and became quasi-experts,"" Lamia said. ""(Singer) was more than our military consultant. He became our political consultant for the future."" Review: 'Halo 4' is franchise's best yet . Singer said the world is no longer just driven by the motives of countries but the actions of non-state actors, such as terrorists or criminals. In creating a future for the new game, developers chose not the most likely scenario but one that is more entertaining for gaming purposes. ""You're not just trying to identify what's likely and important, but also frankly, what's cool,"" he said. ""What gives you the most ground to cover ... (is it) going to be cool for the gamers to play with?"" As development was progressing, some of Singer's projections for the future began appearing in the news. The game's creators were excited but a little unnerved to be building the future before it happened. Referencing Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law -- ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"" -- Singer said the 2025 setting allows a familiarity with future technology that makes it seem more real. He tried to put his ideas into three different categories for developers. ""(First,) it's here and it's being deployed in small numbers but you may not have heard about it,"" Singer said. ""Secondly, it's here but it's in prototype stage. It's in the stage where it is working somewhere, a lab, and we should expect to see it on the battlefield in the next coming years."" Singer's third category includes tech that's still at the research stage and hasn't emerged into a viable, working form. This is where Lamia and his team focused much of their effort. ""We didn't want it to feel too sci-fi. That was a term we used a lot,"" Lamia said. ""We wanted it to feel grounded. It was also important on how it fit into the game."" Lamia expected and planned for future tech to be smaller and more powerful, but Singer pushed them into going farther with their thinking. Lamia also told him the designs had to work within the game's narrative. ""It isn't that we didn't want to take a leap of faith in mankind. You look at military technology and some things advance, but you see things that hang around for a while,"" he said. ""For example, there are a fair bit of weapons (in the game) that exist right now and that's because we actually think they'll be around (in 13 years)."" Designers also came up with new some equipment that's never been seen before. ""You'll know it when you see it,"" Lamia said about what felt futuristic enough without being too much like science fiction. ""Sometimes, it was just art direction. It's just a gut call, but we have to create our universe."" Lamia hopes gamers will be impressed with their vision of the future. ""I think when people start to play with the drones, they feel pretty badass,"" Lamia said. ""There's a sequence where we have a jet wing (jet pack) insertion that people are going to crap themselves over. Pretty cool. Pretty epic."" Today's cutting-edge weaponry inspired what appears in the game's futuristic battles. But the influences also went the other way, too. An early trailer for ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" showed a piece of future military hardware that isn't on the current battlefield. A military contractor asked why it wasn't being built and is now showing a prototype at trade shows, Singer said. ""I say it half in jest, but this is one of the ways I will have a great deal of influence in shaping that future,"" he said. ""The world of science fiction continually inspires the real world in everything."" ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" is available for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC. It is scheduled for release on the Wii U on November 18 in North America and November 30 for Europe and Australia.","""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" hit stores Tuesday .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's government announced Friday that at least 682 inmates were participating in a hunger strike in at least 67 prisons across the country, but it insisted that no protesters were in critical condition. The statement by Turkey's Justice Ministry directly contradicted reports issued by members of two opposition parties. Read more: Police, protesters clash at Republic Day march . Dr. Aytug Atici, a medical doctor and a lawmaker from the secularist Republican People's Party, told CNN that prisoners he met during a tour of detention facilities were starting to lose basic brain functions and were showing symptoms of starvation. ""None of the people who have been on strike for 50 days, at the time when we spoke to them (Wednesday), could stand,"" Atici said in a phone interview with CNN. ""They have begun to bleed anally and nasally. They are in critical condition."" Read more: Turkish government asks Kurdish prisoners to end hunger strike . The Justice Ministry said that government doctors were checking the health of hunger strikers daily and that they were being regularly fed rations of salt, honey, lemon, sugar and vitamins. The maximum weight loss of protesters at one prison, the ministry reported, was 8 kilograms (about 18 pounds), though it said that it was impossible to determine weight loss with some detainees because they ""refused to be weighed."" The hunger strike began more than a month ago, and has since spread throughout Turkey's penal system. Most, if not all, of the protesters are ethnic Kurds. Their demands, according to officials from the Peace and Democracy Party -- Turkey's largest and best-organized Kurdish nationalist party -- are twofold: permission to use the Kurdish language in education and in courtrooms, and an end to the solitary confinement and eventual liberation of Abdullah Ocalan.

The movement has been fighting a guerrilla war against the Turkish state for 30 years. Turkey, the U.S. and the EU officially label the PKK a terrorist organization. The hunger strike comes against a backdrop of steadily worsening PKK violence. According to a report published last September by the nonprofit conflict mediation organization International Crisis Group, the violence has killed more than 700 people in a 14-month period. Turkey's prime minister has shown little sympathy for the hunger strikers. ""There is no hunger strike or anything. It's a show,"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a statement before journalists during a visit to Berlin on Wednesday. He went on to suggest that the PKK had ordered the protesters to starve themselves.

Atici, the opposition lawmaker who toured prisons this week, said Erdogan's remarks appeared to have stiffened the protesters' resolve. ""They were furious at the prime minister's remarks ... they felt as if they were being mocked,"" he said. ""Like their demands or not, they have put their bodies on the line."" Read more: Turkey releases 4 jailed journalists pending trial's end . The prison hunger strike is a phenomenon that harkens back to turbulent past decades of Turkish modern history. It was a protest measure used by leftists and communists in the 1990s and at the turn of the century that left scores of people dead. ""When we think about hunger strikes, we always think about people getting killed,"" said Mehmet Ali Birand, a veteran journalist and anchor on Turkish television. ""I remember at that time in 1996 and 2000, public opinion was very much against the government's handling of the situation,"" he added. ""But this time ... public opinion is not buying it ... they are not looking favorably at the hunger strikers."" On Friday, Turkey's semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported another fatality in the long-simmering PKK conflict, which has claimed more than 30,000 lives over the last three decades. The news agency said that at least one soldier was killed and six wounded during a suspected PKK attack on a post in southeastern Turkey on Friday.","Government: There are at least 682 hunger strikers in at least 67 prisons across Turkey .

"(CNN) -- Did Andi Dorfman choose wisely with her final rose? At the very least she chose geographically, as the Atlanta-based former assistant district attorney selected former baseball player Josh Murray, who also lives in her city. No long-distance romance for this pair, but plenty of speculation about whether their engagement will actually result in a marriage. Left holding his heart in his hand was Chicago-based businessman Nick Viall, who was dumped in a very nontraditional ""Bachelorette"" way. Instead of waiting for the final rose ceremony, Dorfman went to his room and broke the news to him. ""Honestly, the last date, I wanted to just have fun and relax, and hard as I tried I couldn't do that with you. ... With you I overanalyze everything,"" Dorfman told him. ""A life with you would be overanalyzing every single moment."" That left Murray to receive the final rose after a few minutes of ""suspense."" But the real drama came during the live ""After the Rose"" show, in which Viall questioned Dorfman's decision in light of some of the moments fans didn't see on camera. ""If you weren't in love with me,"" he said, ""I'm just not sure why you made love to me."" Thus went another ""Bachelor/Bachelorette"" unspoken ""tradition"" in that much can be hinted at -- but contestants are never, ever to spill the sexual beans.

"Havana (CNN) -- Cuban President Raul Castro on Thursday met with a delegation from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a powerful lobbying group championing capitalism and free markets. ""We talked about steps forward that might be taken by both countries"" to improve U.S.-Ã¢â¬ÂªCuba relations, Thomas Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said as the delegation prepared to board a private plane back to the U.S. at the end of its three-day visit. ""It was positive and we expect to talk again,"" Donohue said on meeting Castro. The 12-person delegation included executives from Cargill, one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products and foods, and Amway, the direct-selling mega-corporation. Most trade between Cuba and the U.S. is outlawed by the latter's 52-year trade embargo on the island. The delegation met owners of small businesses in Cuba and toured a state auto repair shop that has been turned into a private cooperative. Donohue spoke to students and government officials Thursday about the power of free markets at the University of Havana, where Fidel Castro studied law before embarking on the path to revolution. ""Those of us who oppose the embargo are often accused of excusing or ignoring the Cuban government's record on human rights and personal freedom,"" Donohue told the crowd. ""In fact they need to be addressed by our governments in a constructive and ongoing dialogue."" Donohue praised Cuban government efforts to attract more international investment and allow more of its citizens to work for themselves but said the island had to go further with its economic reforms. ""We deeply believe that countries with strong private sectors, free of excessive government control and ownership, will have the most successful and productive economies."" Under reforms initiated by Raul Castro, nearly 500,000 Cubans have started their own businesses, activity that was strictly forbidden for much of the Cuban revolution. In March, Cuba's National Assembly passed a new foreign investment law that aims to attract billions of dollars in international financing. Despite the changes slowly unfolding in the Cuban economy, it remains unclear if there will be any significant alteration to the current stalemate in Cuba-U.S. relations. Although President Barack Obama allowed Cuban-Americans to make unlimited visits to the island and lifted the cap on remittances they could send to relatives, the improving relationship between the two countries was overshadowed by the arrest of U.S. State Department contractor Alan Gross in 2009. Gross is serving a 15-year sentence in Cuba for importing illegal satellite communications equipment to the island as part of what Cuban officials have called a plot to foment dissent. Cuban officials have said they wish to discuss Gross' case along with those of three Cuban intelligence officers imprisoned in the U.S. But so far, U,S, officials have said relations will not improve between the two countries until Gross is released. Despite the challenges, Donohue said the President struck an optimistic note about the future of the two nations' relations. ""I think he's a hopeful man,"" he said.","The 12-person delegation included executives from Cargill and Amway .

"(CNN) -- Some 518 days after she first set off alone in her sailboat, 16-year-old Laura Dekker glided into a Caribbean port on Saturday to complete her historic, and controversial, voyage around the globe. The Dutch citizen arrived in Sint Maarten around 3 p.m. (2 p.m. ET), her spokesman Anton Van de Koppel told CNN. And a picture linked from Dekker's official website Saturday shows her standing behind a group of children holding a sign, ""Congratulations Laura Dekker ... Welcome back to St. Maarten."" While other teens have made similar sea voyages -- some of them without stopping, as Dekker did -- the Dutch girl unofficially appears to be the youngest to do so sailing alone. In 2010, Australian Jessica Watson finished a non-stop, unassisted solo circumnavigation days before her 17th birthday. But sailing journalists have said, and her team didn't dispute, that her route was less than 21,600 orthodromic (or, in the same direction for a great circle) nautical miles, which is the length of the equator and the distance generally used for round-the-world sailing records. Dekker states on her website that she traversed about 27,000 nautical miles on her own solo voyage aboard her 38-foot yacht, which she has dubbed Guppy. She was 14 when she began August 21, 2010, in Gibraltar and then headed west across the Atlantic Ocean, through the Panama Canal, across the Pacific, through the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope, and ultimately to her final destination in the Caribbean. The trip almost didn't happen -- not because of problems at sea, but rather due to a high-profile legal fight by Dutch authorities to prevent the teen from setting sail, for her own safety. 14-year-old attempts world record . In August 2009, Dekker was put under state care for two months, following her parents' refusal to prevent her from undertaking the voyage. Then, in October 2009, a Dutch court ruled the girl couldn't sail around the world because she was not considered experienced enough to do so. But it left the door open for a future trip, deciding that she could depart if she fulfilled certain requirements the court had established for her. ""As a 13-year-old girl, it was never my intention to be the center of world news,"" Dekker wrote on her blog three days before docking in Sint Maarten. ""Now, after sailing around the world, with difficult port approaches, storms, dangerous reefs, and the full responsibility of keeping myself and the Guppy safe, I feel that the nightmares the Dutch government organizations put me through, were totally unfair,"" she added. 16-year-old circumnavigates the globe . Dekker made stops in numerous coastal sites during her trip, in places such as the Galapagos Islands, Bora Bora and Cape Town, South Africa. According to multiple published reports, including in the St. Maarten newspaper Today, she had once planned to return to Gibraltar by going through the Suez Canal, but altered her route and headed around South Africa toward Sint Maarten to avoid pirates. The day before docking for the last time, she reflected on the early days of her voyage, including her initial time in the Caribbean more than a year earlier. ""It feels like it was just yesterday but at the same time it seems like it was an eternity ago,"" wrote Dekker, who was actually born on a boat in port in New Zealand. ""Back then I had no idea I would be back now with a life load of new experiences and 27,000 nautical miles under Guppy's keel. ""But here I am having almost circumnavigated the whole world. Yes, that idea is slowly sinking in... But I don't really believe it."" CNN's Sherri Maksin contributed to this report.","Laura Dekker was at sea or in port for 518 days, her website states .

"(CNN) -- The tiniest iPhone rumors can cause a big uproar. The latest: The blog TechCrunch on Wednesday published a story claiming the next-generation iPhone will have a new connection port that's about a third the size of the one on the current model. The reaction on blogs and on Twitter has been largely negative, with commenters saying the new port -- used to charge the phone and connect it to other devices -- would render obsolete existing chargers and accessories such as speaker sets. ""Every other phone manufacturer decided back in 2008 to conform to the MicroUSB standard, and that's been wonderful,"" one commenter, identified as Scott Ableman, wrote on the TechCrunch story. ""But Apple wants people to feel they have to buy proprietary accessories from them. Don't get me wrong. I respect them as marketers and profiteers. I just hate their contempt for me as a customer."" ""Are standards just too easy for Apple to use?"" asked Calob Horton, a writer for the blog Pocketables, which focuses on mobile technology. ""Does the company feel the need to create its own, proprietary hardware to feel special, more profitable or even more popular?"" He added: ""I understand the lust Apple has towards thinness and being able to cram more tech into a small package, but it can be achieved without its own port designs that can make the devices incompatible with other companies' products."" Apple hasn't announced whether or not it's working on a new iPhone, much less confirmed specifications such as the type of dock that will be included, and the company did not respond immediately to CNN's request for comment. Most observers expect Apple to introduce its next iPhone this fall since the current 4S model was launched last October and the company has a history of releasing upgraded phones each year. TechCrunch said its report is based on interviews with three independent manufacturers of Apple accessories that said the new iPhone will include a 19-pin dock instead of the current 30-pin model. In 2003, Apple introduced the 30-pin dock connector on the third-generation iPod. Since then, the port has been a fixture at the bottom of Apple's mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPad. The connection type is proprietary, meaning cords and accessories that use the 30-pin dock only work with Apple devices. Still, the dock has become ""insanely ubiquitous,"" as Pocketables writes, to the point that it's almost a standard of its own. It's unclear if the new dock will be another only-Apple standard. Writing for the site ZDNet, Jason D. O'Grady said the new port ""presumably"" adheres to the Micro USB standard, which is used on most other mobile phones. If that's the case, he said, the switch could have all kinds of advantages, including saving consumers money (a 30-pin cord from Apple costs $19; Micro USB cords start at less than $1) and making it easier for Apple to comply with a European law that requires Micro USB ports on new mobile phones. (Apple gets around this by selling an adapter in Europe.) Either way, if the Apple standard changes, iPhone owners may be left, as @shmidtb writes on Twitter, with ""a bunch of worthless cords"" on their hands. What do you think? Would you welcome a new connector format? Let us know in the comments.","The next-generation iPhone will have a smaller connection port, according to a report .
A different-size port would mean existing iPhone charging cords won't work on new model .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban President Fidel Castro published a thinly-veiled complaint Tuesday that he is not being kept up to date on happenings in Cuba. In a short note signed by Castro, 87, on the front page of the Cuban communist party daily Granma, Castro lamented that he was tardy in paying his respects at the passing of Eugenio George, the longtime coach of Cuba's female volleyball team. George, 81, died Saturday and was buried the next day, according to Castro's note. ""Many comrades noticed the absence of a floral arrangement from us,"" Castro wrote. ""I always admired him but did not know of his passing until some hours later."" During his 47 years in power, Castro was famous for his marathon speeches and micromanagement of Cuba's economy and international affairs. But following a still-undisclosed intestinal illness in 2006, Castro was forced to step down, eventually being replaced by his brother Raul as President in 2008. Absent from public view for months at a time, Castro briefly returned to the spotlight in 2012 when he began to publish short ""reflections"" columns in the Cuban state press. But Castro stopped publishing the columns, which detailed varied topics such as the former leader's interest in yoga and medicinal plants, after he said he no longer had time to write. Castro is still referred to as ""the historic leader"" of the Cuban revolution by the island's state-run press and government officials say he is consulted before major decisions are taken. But in May, Bolivian President Evo Morales, a close ally to Cuba, told the Spanish language edition of the magazine Vanity Fair that Castro ""isn't aware of what's going on any more.""","Fidel Castro writes that he was tardy in paying respects after the death of a well-known coach .

"(CNN) -- When I hear about an outrageous story involving kids -- and we know there is another crazy one just about every day -- I often try to put myself in the shoes of the parents at the center of the controversy. How would I have acted? What would I have wanted my daughters to do? In the case of a teen recently punished by her school for trying to drive a drunk friend home, I find myself firmly siding with the girl and her parents -- and wondering what on Earth the school administrators were thinking. Two weeks ago, Erin Cox, an honors high school student who lives near Boston, got a call from a friend at a party who was too drunk to drive. Cox went to the party to get her friend, and shortly after she got there, police arrived and arrested a dozen kids for underage drinking, warning 15 others, including Cox, they would get a summons for drinking, according to the Boston Herald. Even though Cox wasn't drinking and a police officer vouched for her sobriety in a written statement, according to the Herald, her school, North Andover High, charged that she violated its zero-tolerance policy when it comes to alcohol and drug use. Her punishment? She was demoted from her position as captain of her volleyball team and told she would be suspended for five games. What sways teens not to drink, drive? Stories, not stats . All because she did the right thing, as far as this reporter mom is concerned. I would hope my girls, now in elementary school, would do what Cox did if they ever found themselves in a similar situation. ""She did what we teach our kids to do!! Friends don't let friends drive drunk!"" wrote Stevie Street, one of the thousands of commenters on CNN's Facebook page expressing outrage and disappointment at the school's decision. For some, the issue is very personal. ""My daughter was killed at age 17 riding in a car with a drunk driver. How I wish she would have called us or asked a sober friend to drive her home. The girl should be rewarded, not punished, for potentially saving a life,"" Karen Donahue Moses said, also on Facebook. ""I know someone ... who was raped at a party after passing out drunk. Her friends had left without her,"" a commenter named David wrote in an e-mail. ""Looking out for your friends, making sure they get home safe, that's the responsible thing to do. If that student had just left her friend there, she could have been assaulted, she could have driven drunk or ridden with a drunk driver."" Cox's family filed a lawsuit to force the school to reverse its decision, but a judge ruled that the court did not have jurisdiction over the school's decision, according to reports. Now, she and her family plan to file formal legal action against the school district ""in the hope that officials there will think twice before imposing sanctions on any student whose only offense involves trying to prevent yet another drunk-driving tragedy,"" Wendy Murphy, Cox's attorney, said in a statement. ""(Erin) wants to really raise awareness of the issue to the point where people understand it's much better to encourage kids to help each other and that by pursing additional legal action, she hopes that her school and other schools will understand why it's so important for young people to watch out for each other,"" Murphy said. Repeated calls and e-mails to the school, the school district and the school's lawyer have not been returned. In a comment to the Herald, Geoffrey Bok, who represented the high school in court, said the school had basically no choice once the police got involved. ""The school is really trying to take a very serious and principled stand regarding alcohol,"" he said. ""And we all get that. Teen drinking is a serious problem."" Kendra Vinson Sales, in an e-mail and on her blog, said that Cox should be ""the example of what to do when you need a ride home from a party."" ""Instead, now students at this school are filled with mixed signals and contradictory messages,"" wrote Vinson Sales. ""From now on, students will think twice about calling a friend for help or worse, they may not reach out to help a friend in a similar situation."" CDC: Teen drinking and driving rates cut in half . Although 95% of the comments we've received via e-mail or on Facebook were wildly critical of the school for its decision, there were a few voices of support online. ""While I am not a fan of zero tolerance policies, zero means zero. If you are going to put the policy in place, you must enforce it,"" Jill Worden Benjamin wrote on CNN's Facebook page. ""She wasn't punished for driving a friend home. Why do people keep saying that? She was actually punished for being in a place (where) alcohol was served,"" Nancy Taylor said, also on Facebook. ""I'm sure she is well aware of the school's policy. She chose to violate that policy."" ""Just because she was an honors student and the captain of the volleyball team shouldn't give her a free pass to disregard the school's known zero tolerance policy,"" Elyse Bruce said on CNN Living's Facebook page. ""To let her off the hook is to discriminate against those who are not honors students or captains of sports teams who take the school police seriously and abide by it."" YouTube confession: Sincere or slick manipulation? ""This is the second time in a week CNN has gauged levels of national outrage over a ridiculous K-12 school policy applied in a ridiculous manner,"" Adam of Alexandria, Virginia, wrote in an e-mail. He was referring to last week's story, which we covered on CNN Parents, about a school banning the use of most balls during recess and even requiring supervision of rough games of tag while the schoolyard space is restricted due to a construction project. Adam said these stories reflect a failure of common sense in education. ""Let's hope North Andover High's administrators pick humility over hubris, amend their anti-alcohol policy to prevent such unintended consequences, pardon the student caught up in their mistake, publicly apologize and move on,"" he added. ""Then let's hope the school district responsible for next week's episode of '(Administrators) Gone Wild' does the same."" What do you think of the school's decision? Tell us below in the comments.

"Washington (CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush left the White House more than five years ago and has since stayed out of most Washington debates. But it would be hard to tell that if you have been listening to Hillary Clinton over the past month. From defending her record at the State Department to defining her economic vision, Clinton has used Bush as her primary rhetorical device to both explain her vision for the future and defend her past. ""The biggest accomplishment in the four years as secretary of state was helping to restore American leadership and we did that in a number of ways,"" Clinton said earlier this month before faulting Bush for the U.S. standing on the world stage when he left the White House in 2009. Democrats have always been fond of faulting Bush and it was part of President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. But the fact that Clinton, who is admittedly thinking about running for president in 2016, is attacking him says as much about how she views her future as it does about the state of the Republican Party. The former first lady has started pointing to the Bush administration when talking about the turmoil in Iraq, too. When pressed about Obama removing troops from the country, Clinton regularly points out -- and did so at a CNN town hall on Tuesday -- that the withdrawal decision was made by Bush, not Obama. When asked earlier this month in New York about troops in Iraq and the failure to get a status of forces agreement, Clinton said, ""The deadline on Iraq was set by the prior administration, that if there were not a status of forces agreement... there would not be American troops."" Strategy not without problems . Democrats close to Clinton love the Bush lines. ""Seems to me Hillary thinks George W. Bush was a terrible President,"" Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and a longtime Clinton confidant, said before enumerating a number of ways he feels Bush failed, including two ""botched"" wars, turning ""a massive surplus into a crippling debt"" and presiding ""over an economic collapse."" ""I hope she keeps it up,"" Begala said. But the strategy does not come without problems. While Bush was unpopular in office -- and still is with Democrats -- his standing has improved since leaving Washington. His overall approval rating hit a seven-year high in 2013 with 47% of Americans approving how he handled his tenure. While 50% said they disapproved, the trend has been been up in recent years. Most presidents experience this when they leave the job. By bashing Bush, Clinton is also looking backward. Her book tour/campaign has carefully tried to keep her looking forward. She told an audience in Canada on Wednesday that she doesn't think much about her legacy because she is ""very present-oriented and future-oriented."" Republicans see any strategy that has Clinton looking backward as a winner for them. ""She is the personification of a political system that voters believe needs new blood and new energy,"" said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former Mitt Romney spokesman. ""So looking back, Clinton may feel that she has an advantage because she gets to point fingers at George W. Bush, but it is problematic for a candidate who is essentially part of the status quo for the last 25 years,"" Madden said. People close to Clinton reject that idea. ""Part of charting a new course for the future is a clear-eyed assessment of where we are and how we got here,"" Begala said. ""Hillary is simply speaking her mind. Radical candor -- I love it."" The enemy of my enemy is my friend . For Clinton, bashing Bush might be more than just a standard red and blue tactic, though. In front of a liberal audience at the New America Foundation in Washington last month, Clinton brought out her most fiery Bush rhetoric. The speech was, in part, an attempt to make inroads with progressive Democrats, some of whom have been apprehensive about Clinton's more moderate positions. Bush, she said, ""allowed the evolution of an entire shadow banking system that operated without accountability"" and failed ""to invest adequately in infrastructure, education, basic research and then the housing crash, the financial crisis hit like a flash flood."" Clinton then went on to say that the Bush years showed that ""we can turn surpluses into debt, we can return to rising defects, that is what happens when your only policy prescription is to cut taxes for the wealthy."" CNN contributor and progressive activist Sally Kohn said if she were in Clinton's camp, bashing Bush ""is exactly what I would be doing."" Kohn is an outspoken Clinton critic. In a recent CNN opinion piece she asked, ""Does Hillary Clinton have to be so boring?"" Other than changing her positions on a number of fundamental issues, Kohn said, siding with the left by showing her distaste for a shared bogeyman could be effective. ""He is a universally known quantity,"" Kohn said. ""It is a way for her to run against something that is concrete because she can't run against President Obama."" To Kohn, Bush is Clinton's foil against the left. She shows that she shares their opinion on him, but subtly says to progressives that she doesn't ""want too much noise or else"" you will get another Bush. Don't elevate anyone current . Few president run for elected office again and Bush seems more content these days with painting than politicking. And Clinton knows that. By focusing on Bush, Clinton isn't elevating any other potential rivals who don't have the name recognition she does. When Clinton is asked about gridlock in Washington or the lack of legislation getting passed on Capitol Hill, she regularly mentions House or congressional Republicans in general terms and never mentions some of her possible 2016 contenders -- like Sen. Ted Cruz or Sen. Rand Paul - by name. ""There is no distinctive Republican head of the party for her to post up against,"" Madden said. ""So she is again going to this habitual reflex: Just blame Bush."" On the contrary to Clinton, Republicans like Cruz and Paul are ready and willing to be mentioned with Clinton. Paul regularly jumps at the opportunity to fault Clinton and frequently says the Benghazi terrorist attack should disqualify Clinton from holding higher office in the future. Asked about Paul's attacks last week, Clinton told ABC that ""He can talk about whatever he wants to talk about. And if he decides to run, he'll be fair game too."" Clinton did not, however, refer to Paul by name in her answer. Cruz, too, is eager to confront Clinton. ""Secretary Clinton from the beginning has stonewalled on this rather than acting as a partner getting to the bottom of what happened,"" the Texas Republican said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" after the town hall. This strategy, Madden says, helps elevate their profile on a level with hers and may be the most potent way to build ""a strong national profile as a potential Republican candidate.""","Hillary Clinton has used Bush to defend her record, explain vision for the future .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Top House Democrats Tuesday proposed a ""war surtax"" to pay for the war in Iraq, a plan quickly condemned by Republicans and opposed by the House leadership. Rep. Dave Obey Tuesday said the surtax is a way for ""this generation"" to pay for the Iraq war. The surtax would be ""a percentage of your tax bill,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey, D-Wisconsin. ""And if you don't like the cost, then shut down the war."" The measure -- sponsored by Obey, Rep. Jack Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, and Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts -- would require low- and middle-income taxpayers to add 2 percent to their tax bill, while higher-income taxpayers would add 12 to 15 percent, Obey said. The House Democratic leadership made it clear Wednesday that they had not signed off on the measure. In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, House speaker Nancy Pelosi blasted President Bush for not asking Americans to sacrifice and ""adding hundreds of billions of dollars in debt for future generations to repay."" But Pelosi said she will not back the measure. ""Some have suggested that shared sacrifice should take the form of a draft; others have suggested a surtax. Those who oppose a tax and the draft also should oppose the president's war,"" Pelosi said. ""Just as I have opposed the war from the outset, I am opposed to a draft and I am opposed to a war surtax."" A spokesman for the House Ways and Means committee, which handles all tax measures, told CNN ""there's no expectation that this proposal will come before the committee."" The proposal comes as the Bush administration requested an additional $190 billion for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obey estimated the surtax would annually generate between $140 and $150 billion dollars which is equivalent to the annual cost of the war in Iraq.  Watch Obey say he will not give the White House a blank check"" Â» . ""This is the first time in American history that when a president has taken a country to war and said 'by the way folks, we're going to have to sacrifice and the way to sacrifice is by cutting your taxes.'"" Obey said. ""It makes no sense."" Speaking at a Capitol Hill press conference, McGovern said families of troops serving in Iraq would be exempt from the surtax, and that the tax was similar to ones imposed during War War II and the Vietnam War. The Republican leadership was quick to condemn the proposal. ""Raiding every taxpayer's wallet for the purposes of playing politics with our national security amounts to one of the most irresponsible proposals I've seen in a long, long time,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner said in a statement. ""It's time for Democrats to support our troops and the strategy that has led them to make undeniable progress in Iraq."" A Democratic leadership aide dismissed criticism from the GOP, saying, ""Republicans are talking about something [surtax proposal] that's never going to see the light of day, but they're doing it at their own peril because the more they talk about the costs of war, the more Americans will listen."" Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said he agreed ""this generation ought to help pay for"" the war but that there was no agreement on backing the bill. ""One of the stories I just read said 'the Democrats propose,'"" Hoyer said. ""This is a proposal by Mr. Obey. Mr. Murtha and Mr. McGovern. This is not a party proposal.""  E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Belarus investigators described a suspect in Monday's subway bombing that killed 12 people as a 27-year-old man, but they were unsure about motives or if the bomber had help. ""We do not rule out that he had accomplices,"" Belarusian State Security Committee head Vadim Zaitsev said Tuesday. Three other men have been held for questioning, Zaitsev said at a news conference. Preliminary findings suggest the blast was caused by a radio-controlled device, and that no suicide bombers were involved, Belarusian officials said. The Belarusian KGB is considering three possible motives behind the bombing, including an attempt at destabilizing the security situation in Belarus, revenge by extremist organizations, and an act by a madman, Zaitsev said. He added that the KGB has not ruled out that the suspect, who was wearing a brown jacket and a brown wool hat, may have been a paid mercenary. Police are studying closed-circuit TV camera recordings that might shed light on the crime, Belarus Interior Minister Anatoly Kuleshov said. A train was standing at the Oktyabrskaya metro station in Minsk when a handmade bomb planted under a bench exploded Monday, officials said. The incident is described by officials as an act of terrorism. The bomb, with estimated power equivalent of 5 kilograms of TNT, was stuffed with shrapnel, nails and small metal balls, the state-run news agency Belta reported, citing security officials. The death toll rose to 12 when one of the victims died in a hospital early Tuesday, RIA Novosti reported. ""Experienced investigators and criminalists"" from Russia's investigative committee were on their way to Minsk to help with the investigation, according to the committee's website. Zaitsev said Belarus welcomes the international help. ""We will not refuse help from other countries either,"" he said. Victims' families will receive $10,000 from the government and their funeral expenses will be covered, Belarus state media reported Tuesday.  Funerals are expected to take place Wednesday and Thursday, according to the city hall in Minsk. More than 150 people have been hospitalized, and some of the wounded are in serious or critical condition, Russian media said. The government declared there will be a national day of mourning on Wednesday, Belta said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued his condolences. British Minister for Europe David Lidington expressed his shock. ""I understand that the Belarusian authorities believe this was an act of terrorism.  The United Kingdom utterly condemns all such actions, and our thoughts are with all of those affected by this tragic event,"" he said. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called the blast a ""terrorist attack"" and offered to help investigate who was behind the explosion, the Kremlin said in a statement. Medvedev made the remarks in a telephone call with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who later said at an emergency government meeting that he accepted the offer of assistance. Lukashenko ordered officials to increase public transport security, according to the state-run news agency Belta. He also instructed security officials to investigate whether this latest blast could have any connection with an explosion in downtown Minsk in July 2008, Belta reported. That bomb went off during an open-air concert, injuring some 55 people. ""Perhaps, they are linked. Establish who could benefit in disrupting the calm and stability in the country and find out who is behind the attack,"" Lukashenko said, according to Belta.

"(CNN) -- If you have lived a happy, normal, American life, you have probably never heard of something so tedious and alien as a Miscellaneous Tariff Bill. I envy you. But strange as it sounds, the obscure MTB is at the heart of a very small -- but very significant -- fight for American freedom. So, what is an MTB? It works like this. Every day, you and I use materials that come from other countries. From umbrellas to medicines to cars, even if they are made in the USA, their plastics and chemicals and other raw components are often imported. Frequently, these raw materials are taxed at the border with federal tariffs, even if such products aren't produced in the United States and therefore must be imported. And so, every year, hundreds of American companies ask Washington for relief from one or another tariff in the form of a ""duty suspension"" - essentially a waiver on the tariff. These suspensions can typically save an American company hundreds of thousands of dollars that in turn allows them to keep more Americans employed, while giving consumers access to less expensive, higher quality products we might otherwise go without. Each particular duty suspension must first be introduced as its own bill. They all get referred to the same congressional committees, which then pass them along to the International Trade Commission, which vets the merits of the application and sends back the approved ones packaged into -- you guessed it -- a Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, which passes the House and Senate without any objection from anyone. It's a bipartisan no-brainer. Except, well, look at that first step again. Each individual tariff suspension has to be turned into a special bill and introduced by the company's representative or senator. Why? Why can't companies just petition the International Trade Commission directly, since they're the agency that reviews the applications anyway? I mean, who could possibly benefit from a process whereby nonpolitical companies, rightly focused on their customers and products, are forced by Congress to hire a lobbyist and pony up cash for re-election campaigns in order to get something the law says they deserve? Who, indeed? The process is worse than unfair and inefficient; it's fundamentally un-republican and un-democratic. If an application to suspend a tariff has merit, small businesses shouldn't be forced to grovel and kiss the ring of their own public servant to get it suspended. This is why this bad process has been treated just like spending earmarks under House and Senate rules for years and why Republicans in the House and Senate included limited tariff benefits as part of the earmark ban after 2010 elections. Some want to restart this part of the political favor factory and hope Americans don't notice Republicans breaking their own earmark ban, and others want to redefine earmarks to create a loophole for tariff suspensions. But the whole purpose of the earmark ban was to change the way we do business, not to change the definitions and rules of earmarks to pretend bad behavior is suddenly alright. And we wonder why Congress's approval rating is in the single digits. That's why I have introduced bipartisan legislation to end this odious practice and reform the MTB process once and for all. The bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, streamlines the MTB process by allowing manufacturers to petition the trade commission directly. Under our reformed process, once these requests have been properly vetted, the trade commission can make its recommendations to Congress. Congress would retain its authority over trade policy and the ability to assist constituent companies with the MTB process, while the time and money saved from cutting out the lobbying process will benefit small businesses and their consumers, to say nothing of disinfecting the ugly, quasi-feudalism of the current pay-to-play racket. Our legislation would level the playing field for small businesses. As it is, the companies that obtain duty suspensions are too often those that can afford the most expensive, well-connected lobbyists. Our proposal allows every business to bring its case before a group of independent commissioners at the trade commission right from the start; no longer will large corporations be able to buy their way to the front of the line. Cleaning up bureaucracy and giving small businesses a fair shake in Washington is just one small step toward helping a few more citizens to go back to enjoying a happier and more normal American life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim DeMint.","Sen. Jim DeMint: Manufacturers who want tariff exemptions must get OK from Congress .

"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers could turn anything into a joke, and that includes her own funeral. As unearthed by Mashable's Brian Ries, the comedian concocted a very specific, and very funny, burial service wish list in her 2012 book, ""I Hate Everyone ... Starting With Me."" Needless to say, Rivers was not planning a simple farewell. ""When I die ... I want my funeral to be a huge showbiz affair with lights, cameras, action,"" Rivers says in the book. Joan Rivers was a pointed, pioneering comedian . ""I want Craft services, I want paparazzi and I want publicists making a scene! I want it to be Hollywood all the way,"" she continues. ""I don't want some rabbi rambling on; I want Meryl Streep crying, in five different accents."" Mourners can skip the eulogy, because Rivers would rather have ""Bobby Vinton to pick up my head and sing 'Mr. Lonely.' I want to look gorgeous, better dead than I do alive. I want to be buried in a Valentino gown and I want Harry Winston to make me a toe tag."" And, last but definitely not least, ""I want a wind machine so that even in the casket my hair is blowing just like BeyoncÃÂ©'s."" We can only hope Rivers gets her wish.

"(CNN) -- For Canada, the cost of either meeting its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, or failing to do so, was too much to bear. On Monday, the country became the first signatory of the landmark climate treaty to back out of the deal, citing the huge potential cost of legally binding commitments. Confirming the move, environment minister Peter Kent said to meet its obligations under the accord Canada would have to take every single vehicle off its roads. ""Every car, truck, ATV, tractor, ambulance, police car,"" he elaborated in a media briefing, before giving another equally unpalatable option of closing down the country's entire farming and agricultural sector and cutting heat to every home, building and factory. If the country failed to do so, Kent said taxpayers would have to give $14 billion to other countries ""with no impact on emissions or the environment."" How did it come to this? Canada's move was not unexpected. Since being elected into power in 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has made it clear he was not a supporter of the controversial pact. Canada quits climate pact . The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997 by the previous Liberal government, which committed Canada to cutting greenhouse gas emissions 6% below 1990 levels by 2012. In fact, levels have been rising, according to readings submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The announcement came after the end of the latest round of talks involving the 195 parties to the UNFCCC in Durban, South Africa. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had just finished saying that a ""significant agreement"" had been reached, which has been dubbed ""The Durban Platform,"" when Canada pulled the plug. But while Kent repeated his claim that Kyoto, for Canada, ""is in the past,"" he described The Durban Platform as ""the way forward."" What is The Durban Platform? The new deal, agreed Sunday, brings in major emitters of greenhouse gas emissions including the United States, China, India and Brazil. For that, it was hailed a success, although critics still argue that the timetable is too loose. The parties agreed to extend the Kyoto Protocol, which was due to expire at the end of 2012, and to discuss a legally binding pact to cover all major emitters by 2015, with any agreed deal to start in 2020. ""Right now the global climate regime amounts to nothing more than a voluntary deal that's put off for a decade,"" said Kumi Naidoo, the international executive director of environmental campaign group Greenpeace. ""This could take us over the two degree threshold where we pass from danger to potential catastrophe."" The package includes the first contributions to a $100 billion Green Climate Fund to help developing countries to invest in clean energy and adapt to climate change. An Adaptation Committee will be formed to co-ordinate adaptation activities worldwide with agreement on a ""Technology Mechanism"" to smooth the way. What impact will Canada's departure have on the treaty? Canada is just one of the 41 ""Annex 1"" countries and the European Union to have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and its departure is not expected to lead to any kind of collapse. However, its decision to formally leave the pact does send a symbolic message to other countries which might be looking for a way out, according to Greenpeace. ""The Kyoto Protocol is still quite shaky with many countries wanting to jump out of the ship. This Canadian position to leave behind the Kyoto Protocol does destabilize the positive action,"" said Li Yan, the group's climate and energy manager in Beijing. Li said the new deal, to be agreed before 2015, will also include legally binding commitments so countries that opt out now are only delaying the financial pain. ""There really is no escape from the responsibility,"" she added. Opinion: World needs climate change 'Plan B' Which countries could follow? Russia and Japan have already made it clear they're not in favor of extending the Kyoto Protocol, but are yet to formally pull out. Nick Nuttall, spokesman for the United Nation's Environment Program, said any further departures would seem premature with new the treaty negotiations underway, as agreed in Durban. Before the Durban talks, Russia's chief negotiator Alexander Bedritsky said the Kyoto Protocol ""neither resolves the problems of global warming, nor ensures meeting the global two-degree target, nor provides for environmental integrity."" The U.S. has long refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on the grounds that it doesn't bind other major emitters, including China, to legally binding limits. On Tuesday, Beijing expressed regret at the Canadian decision. ""It is regrettable and flies in the face of the efforts of the international community for Canada to leave the Kyoto Protocol at a time when the Durban meeting, as everyone knows, made important progress by securing a second phase of commitment to the Protocol,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said at a news briefing, according to Reuters. What does the most recent science say? Leading scientists agree that the world is on a path to rising average global temperatures which could have a disastrous humanitarian and environmental impact. Global carbon dioxide levels rose to an average of 389 parts per million in 2010, compared with 386 ppm in 2009, according to figures released in November by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A level of 350ppm is considered by scientists to be the safe upper limit for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In Copenhagen in 2009, countries agreed to work towards keeping the increase in global temperatures below two degrees Celsius to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. Extreme weather the norm in 2011 . According to the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) provisional status report, 2011 was the 10th warmest year on record and warmer than any other year with a La Nina event. ""Our science is solid and it proves unequivocally that the world is warming ..."" WMO secretary-general Michel Jarraud said.","Canada pulls out of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on climate change .

"(CNN) -- A Wyoming man was charged Friday with four counts of first-degree murder after, authorities say, he shot dead three of his children and another relative inside his home. According to the warrant for his arrest, Everett E. Conant III is also charged with attempted first-degree murder, aggravated battery and possession of a deadly weapon with unlawful intent. Magistrate Scott Cole ordered Conant held with no bond, following his arraignment Friday afternoon in Platte County. In addition to the four dead, law enforcement said that Conant shot and injured an adult woman -- identified in court records as Suzette Ann Conant, the suspect's wife. Wheatland Police Officer Doug Wiggins wrote in a criminal affidavit that he encountered the woman on the street shortly after 5 p.m. Thursday, soon after he'd arrived to investigate a report of screaming and shots fired. The woman, who had been shot in the leg and shoulder, identified her husband as the shooter and said her children may have been shot as well, according to the affidavit. She said that Conant was still in the house and armed. Wiggins said he then confronted the suspect through a doorway, at one point observing something black in his hand during the conversation as well as ""what appeared to be a lifeless body of a male juvenile on the couch, surrounded by blood,"" the affidavit said. The suspect -- later identified as Conant -- was coaxed out of the home, unarmed, after about 10 minutes and was arrested ""without incident."" More officers from Wheatland and the Platte County Sheriff's Office then arrived and went through the house. There, they found the dead bodies of three minors -- who were born between 1993 and 1999, according to charging documents, which did not identify them by name or birthdate. Another adult male, 33-year-old Nacuma Roland Conant, was found shot and struggling to survive. Officers began efforts to try to save the man's life, but he was later pronounced dead at Platte County Memorial Hospital, according to the affidavit from Wiggins. The incident occurred in Wheatland, a town of about 2,400 people that is located about 70 miles north of Cheyenne. Convictions of any of the four first-degree murder charges are punishable, potentially, by the death penalty.

"(CNN) -- Treacherous storm conditions have plagued southern Brazilian states for nearly a week, causing flooding and landslides and displacing thousands of people, a senior official told CNN Saturday. A power outage affects traffic lights in Brazil's Sao Paulo area after a heavy storm. In Santa Catarina, the severe weather started Monday, with a tornado with estimated winds reaching 200 km/h (125 mph) striking the western part of the state, said Santa Catarina Civil Defense Secretary Marcio Luiz Alves. Heavy downpours have continued due to a low pressure system, he said. In one area, video from CNN affiliate TV Record showed people wading through knee-high water. Alves said officials have counted five weather-related deaths and at least 120 injuries. Flooding and landslides have wreaked havoc across the state, especially in the southern region. More than 1.5 million people have been affected by the severe weather, with as many as 1.1 million losing electricity for a day earlier in the week, Alves said. At least 1,906 people are staying in government shelters, while nearly 10,650 have sought safety at the homes of relatives and friends, he said. So far, 67 municipalities in Santa Catarina have declared states of emergency; the western municipality of Guaraciaba has declared a state of ""public calamity."" Eleven municipalities declared a state of emergency in a second battered state, Rio Grande do Sul, according to the state's Web site. Rio Grande do Sul is south of Santa Catarina and shares a border with Uruguay. Close to 200 families were in shelters and parts of the state's capital, Porto Alegre, was flooded. Some traveled in motor boats in flooded areas and homes were almost entirely covered by rain water, video from TV Record showed. The water level of the state's Taquari River is more than 32 feet above normal, officials said. In Santa Catarina, the September rainfall average is about 8 cubic inches. However, at least 11 cubic inches fell over three days this past week, Alves said. Forecasters expect total rainfall for the area to top 24 cubic inches this month, he said. The weather was expected to clear Sunday evening, but heavy rains likely will return Wednesday, Alves said.

"(CNN) -- Weapons, creepy critters and bodily fluids are timeless sources of inspiration for children's toys. But perhaps no franchise capitalized on all those themes better than ""Garbage Pail Kids,"" the gross-out trading cards of the 1980s that parodied Cabbage Patch Kids. To many from that generation, they were the raddest cards your parents wouldn't let you have. Or, maybe you found ways to procure them on your own and became the coolest kid at the lunch table. Those kids are now adults, and the release of a book that compiles ""Garbage Pail Kids"" art allows fans to stroll down a blood-soaked, snot-infested memory lane -- one littered with pudgy limbs and heads that bear a disturbing resemblance to the wholesome Cabbage Patch dolls. ""They fell into a genre that works really well for boys, (one that) that capitalizes on the gross-out, icky, hysterical factor,"" said Adrienne Appell, spokeswoman for the Toy Industry Association. ""This is how young boys play. That's what they find funny and trading cards continue to be popular, affordable options. Kids love to collect, so combining several areas that appeal to kids makes a lot of sense for that specific audience."" Trading card company Topps launched the first set of ""Garbage Pail Kids"" in 1985 as a follow-up to the grotesque creatures of Ugly Stickers and the product parody Wacky Packages, which recast products like Cap'n Crunch as ""Cap'n Crud."" That history was the ""amniotic fluid that the Garbage Pail Kids floated in"" before their release, wrote cartoonist Art Spiegelman, part of the creative team that produced Wacky Packages. The series found quick success with sales at convenience stores and toy stores -- and sparked immediate outrage among parents who didn't see the joke in characters like Nervous Rex, a chain-smoking, nose-picking baby surrounded by cups of coffee and soda bottles, or Guillo Tina, a girl with her head in a guillotine. ""Garbage Pail Kids offered something that was not so benign and parent-friendly,"" Spiegelman wrote in the book's forward. ""Rather, it provoked: 'Oh my god, what is that? Where did you get those? Your allowance is cut off. And you're grounded.' The dolls were pricey and had to appeal to adults. The stickers were available for chump change and appealed to the inner beast in all kids."" Even the publisher that released Spiegelman's Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel, ""Maus: A Survivor's Tale,"" in 1986 expressed relief that his name wasn't attached to the images. ""'If this gets out, they'll review your book and call it 'Garbage Pail Jews,' "" Spiegelman said his editor at Pantheon told him at the time. Somehow, the cards found their way into the homes of children and Topps released five series from 1985 to 1986. ""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie"" was released in 1987 to widespread criticism, with the movie rating website Rotten Tomatoes calling it a ""hastily-assembled live-action film"" meant to capitalize on ""that childish joy in the disgusting."" Another version is reportedly in the works from Michael Eisner's Tornante Company. Or, as Spiegelman put it: ""We were trying to help another generation of juvenile delinquents come of age, to offer them a counterculture. But not one that was counter to our American Way of Life -- we're talking about the bubblegum counter. This was Topps, after all."" Topps asked various artists to contribute sketches of ideas, including Wacky Packages veteran and underground cartoonist John Pound. ""Art said to make the kids gross, nasty, disgusting and rebellious, and I saw that shock value was a huge part of the idea,"" Pound told CNN. ""But as I worked on the sketches, I realized I also wanted the kids and artwork to feel good to look at. Topps hadn't asked for that, but I needed it, so I would enjoy making the art, and so people would enjoy seeing the stickers."" Pound estimates he generated about half of the sketches for the first series, with others sketched out by Topps artists including Mark Newgarden. Pound started with a quick doodles, to see how to best pose the character and the action and then drew it full-size, filing in all the details. Once Topps OK'd the image, he did a quick color study on another copy of the pencil art before painting in acrylics on paper, working from light colors to darker ones. ""Because I could only spend a few hours per painting, I came up with an organized process, that was like doing a jigsaw puzzle. First I painted the shapes for the flesh and hair. Then the clothes. Then the props. And then I airbrushed the background,"" Pound said in an e-mail. For each series, Topps came up with the names after the paintings were done, though sometimes Pound wrote ideas for names in the margins around the paintings, he said. ""The name Garbage Pail Kids was easy to understand, as a parody of the famous Cabbage Patch Kids. The GPK jokes were lowbrow humor for kids, gross and rebellious, something most parents wouldn't like. And I believe the art was appealing, despite the subject matter,"" he said. His favorites? ""Today, I'm liking Phony Lisa, with her mellow, old world glow. Maybe it's because of her chubby hands and cheeks and smug smile,"" he said. ""And Rappin' Ron, because he looks so, well, presidential, and good-natured, for a Garbage Pail Kid. What kind of damage could he possibly do? Because after all, he's just a cute little doll, at the White House podium."" Who was your favorite character?

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Pro-Russian activists and Ukrainian riot police clashed Thursday inside the compound of the prosecutor's office in the eastern city of Donetsk, as simmering tensions escalated into violence. As a result of the clashes, 26 people sought medical help, four of them for gunshot wounds, the Donetsk regional administration's health department said. Two remain hospitalized. At least one police officer was injured in the clashes, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said, adding that shots were fired and small grenades and stones were used in the attack. Police fired tear gas and stun grenades in an effort to disperse the activists, who were armed with clubs, batons and shields but did not appear to be carrying firearms. Some of the activists smashed windows and broke down doors as they sought to enter the building. ""We're going floor to floor looking for people ... for the people who were here beforehand,"" one of the militants said. One woman earlier told a CNN team on the ground that she helped a wounded man who she said was shot by someone from inside the building. Paramedics were called to help the wounded at the site Thursday afternoon. Protest march in Donetsk, rally in Kiev . Earlier in the day, crowds marched through Donetsk, demanding greater autonomy for the restive eastern region. At the head of the march, which was held to mark May Day, was a speaker who accused the authorities in Kiev of pushing pro-Russian supporters to a position where they are demanding a referendum on May 11 and a federal state. Many in the region view the interim government in Kiev as a ""junta"" that seized power thanks to backing from ultranationalist groups, and they are angered by its actions. Eastern Ukraine was a heartland of support for pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, ousted in February after months of protests by people upset that he had turned away from Europe in favor of Moscow. Pro-Russian protesters already control a number of key government buildings in Donetsk, after seizing them last month, and have declared it to be the ""Donetsk People's Republic."" From the industrial city's Lenin Square, where the march started, masked men could be seen atop a building next to a flag signaling support for the pro-Russian camp. The yellow and blue Ukrainian flag, which had been flying until a short time before, was thrown off the side of the building, a symbol of the spreading unrest. Pro-Russian protesters in the city of Luhansk, closer to the Russian border, said Wednesday that they had seized additional government buildings because they wanted to be sure of holding the planned referendum. The crisis has sparked deep divisions in Ukraine. Many also want to see the country remain united, but unhappiness about government corruption and ineffectiveness runs deep. In Ukraine's capital, Kiev, hundreds of people joined a rally Thursday for peace and unity, organized by student and trade union groups and left-of-center parties. The protesters called for constitutional reform, decentralization of power and new parliamentary elections. They also called for a national referendum to decide whether Ukraine should become a federal state; if the Russian language should become the official language in some regions; and whether Ukraine should integrate with the European Union. $17.1 billion bailout approved . Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov acknowledged this week that the central government has effectively lost control of the country's Donetsk and Luhansk regions to the pro-Russian separatists. A controversial referendum in Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region in March resulted in its annexation by Russia, a step widely condemned by the international community. Like Crimea, although not to the same extent, many in eastern Ukraine are Russian-speaking and have close cultural ties to Russia. The interim government, which is struggling with a dire economic situation, has promised constitutional reforms to try to ease tensions ahead of national elections scheduled for May 25. In a key sign of international support, the International Monetary Fund approved a $17.1 billion bailout for Ukraine on Thursday. ""It's obviously not without risk. But it's a necessity to respond to a member's request. And we have tried everything we could to mitigate the implementation risks,"" IMF chief Christine Lagarde told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Lagarde also noted that ""clearly there have been consequences"" for the Russian economy as a result of its intervention in Ukraine. ""If you look at the monetary policy, if you look at the capital flows, if you look at their own forecasts -- there have been consequences on the Russian economy as a result of the geopolitical situation, the uncertainty and the sanctions that have been decided,"" she said. The European Union and United States say Moscow has not so far acted in support of an April 17 international deal aimed at easing the crisis and this week imposed additional sanctions on Russian officials and companies judged to be close to President Vladimir Putin. Diplomat accused of spying . Meanwhile, Ukraine has ordered the expulsion of a Russian naval diplomat after alleged spying this week, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said on its Facebook page Thursday. The statement said the attache was detained ""while he was committing spying activities on April 30th."" The ministry said the diplomat has to leave Ukraine as soon as possible. Ukraine and Western nations have accused Russia, which NATO says has tens of thousands of troops massed by Ukraine's border, of supporting and coordinating separatist unrest in its eastern region. But Russia denies any direct involvement in the disorder, which has seen pro-Russian militia groups seize government and police buildings in more than a dozen towns and cities across the region. Separately, a senior military official told CNN the United States was awaiting additional recommendations from NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Philip Breedlove on potentially expanding current military exercises and adding new ones in Eastern Europe. The goal would be to bolster ""alliance readiness."" NATO allies, particularly those close to Ukraine, have requested a more robust alliance presence, including larger, permanent deployments on their soil. Additional troops would come from U.S. and NATO forces already in Europe. Britain also would contribute, the official said. Ukraine military conscription order . Turchynov signed a decree to introduce compulsory military service ""to increase the defensive powers of the country,"" his office said in a statement Thursday. Men aged 18 to 25 will be subject to the order. The move takes account of the further escalation of the situation in eastern and southern Ukraine, as well as ""instances of overt aggression"" and the actions of pro-Russian militants, the statement said. The aim is to maintain the armed forces and help them ""give an adequate response to real and potential threats to Ukraine,"" according to the statement. Turchynov said Wednesday that the country's armed forces have been put on full combat readiness because of the threat from Russia. Speaking at a meeting with the heads of regional state administrations, he said authorities' task was to prevent the spread of the ""terrorist threat"" from separatists and pro-Russian saboteurs to other regions of Ukraine. A military ""anti-terrorism"" operation launched last month has achieved little or nothing. The government in Kiev has said it wants to show restraint and appears reluctant to embark on military operations against militants who are embedded in residential areas. Russia's Foreign Ministry responded to Turchynov's remarks late Wednesday by denouncing what it called ""these militaristic statements of Kiev authorities."" Meanwhile, militants in the town of Slavyansk continue to hold seven military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, detained last Friday despite their diplomatic status.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani protesters flooded onto Constitution Avenue in Islamabad for another day of demonstrations Sunday, demanding a solution to the growing political crisis wracking the country. At least three people have died in the fighting so far, according to Dr. Ayesha Isani, the spokeswoman for the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad. Local news crews, including cameramen from three different channels, were attacked by police trying to disperse protesters Sunday. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is vowing to remain on the job, despite the violent demonstrations against his government. Security is tight on Constitution Avenue, Pakistan's main political artery, where the nation's major state institutions, including Parliament and the Supreme Court, are located. Protesters again threatened to march on the prime minister's house in Islamabad, as they did Saturday. Sharif has failed to negotiate a solution with the protesters and last week asked the military for help brokering an end to the crisis. About 450 people have been injured in clashes, according to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences and Polytechnic Hospital. Pakistan's defense minister defended the use of tear gas. ""Tear gas is a normal practice undertaken all over the world to disperse a crowd. It is something that is an alternative to using force,"" Minister Khawaja Asif said. ""The situation had precipitated to a point that if action had not been taken then it would have been a free fall for the government."" At least 8,000 people have rallied in the city's center after allegations of vote-rigging during last year's election. Negotiations between Sharif's government and his opponents, some of whom are calling for his resignation, have reached an impasse. Sharif has said he will not resign -- a demand he has called ""unconstitutional."" Imran Khan -- an enigmatic former cricket star who leads one of Pakistan's largest political parties -- has led the two-week protests. Khan is demanding new elections, while outspoken cleric Tahir ul-Qadri -- who wants to overhaul the country's political system -- is demanding much more sweeping reforms. ""The leaders of this country should forget that we will ever back down,"" Qadri told the media Sunday. As the protests have grown in size and scope, the army has stationed personnel at government buildings in case protesters try to occupy them. In Karachi, the scene was stable but tense Sunday as the Muttahida Quami Movement party called for a day of mourning. Shops were closed, and there was little activity on the streets of Pakistan's largest city. Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad and Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Damn those extreme Republicans. President Obama and White House press secretary Jay Carney have found Republicans guilty of extortion and blackmail. Joe Biden, per a report in Politico, once christened Republicans as terrorists. Liberals have led a media assault, calling the GOP anarchists, jihadists, ""gun to head"" hostage takers, and the political equivalent of the Taliban. White House advisor Dan Pfeiffer has likened Republicans to suicide bombers ""with a bomb strapped to their chest."" What could be more extreme? The Democratic Party. True, the Ted Cruz wing in the House of Representatives is relentless, uncompromising and unmoved by practicality. As we all know, there are perhaps 40 or so ""bullet-proof Republicans"" in the House, in safe GOP districts, invulnerable except to Kryptonite. They fear a fellow Republican getting to their right in a primary more than a long-shot Democratic opponent who would paint their district blue in a general election. No doubt, the GOP is a party divided, but there are a lot of Democrats in safe districts, too. Why don't they fear a fellow Democrat getting to their left in a primary? Why aren't the Democrats a party divided between a centrist mainstream and a more extreme, radicalized left? Let us count the reasons: Barack Obama has taken the Democratic Party left of Clinton. He left blue-dog, centrist Democrats to be punished for his sins and they were wiped out in the GOP's 2010 Congressional landslide. All the while, the Internet has empowered and organized the party's remaining and most extreme elements. The Democratic Party can't go left. It is left, in entirety. They already occupy America's left fringe. Bill Clinton's New Democrats are dead. This is not Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party. Today's Democratic Party belongs to Elizabeth Warren. It is the party that just nominated a Sandinista trainee who returned from Nicaragua with ""a vision of unfettered leftist government"" for mayor of New York City, according to the New York Times. And today's Democrats think this is a good thing. They dream audaciously, as Ruy Teixeira wrote in the Atlantic, of a new ""Emerging Democratic Majority."" As Peter Beinart noted in a Daily Beast piece, ""The Rise of the New New Left,"" ""Bill de Blasio's win in New York's Democratic primary isn't a local story. It's part of a vast shift that could upend three decades of American political thinking."" The Democratic Party is now animated by the ""mobilized left,"" Beinart writes, emboldened by Internet activism. Their cause was galvanized by President Obama's seemingly impossible re-election. Once, Obama may have campaigned as a centrist, but that was long ago. He has since governed as an old school economic liberal from the '60s. As Fred Thompson has noted, Barack Obama has been ""George McGovern without the experience."" Obama's answer to every economic challenge has been top-down. Our governing class knows best, he believes, especially since Washington's elite now includes him. If the world has changed in eight decades, our President hasn't noticed. His view of government is cast from the bronze of Franklin Roosevelt and the '30s. He puts our big, dumb, inflexible public sector at the top of American life, to mandate redistribution and prosperity. At every opportunity, he has grown the public sector's archaic program-and-policy factory. This empty presidency tries only to cure too much old government with even more of it. Though little of what he has tried has worked, it has not seemed to deter his party. It hasn't deterred him. His government doesn't govern education: The U.S. educational system barely edges out nations such as Slovakia, in international rankings. His government doesn't govern retirement: Our public-sector retirement system is akin to an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. His government doesn't govern health care: The Affordable Care Act is making health care more unaffordable for many seniors. His old government doesn't govern our economy: A record high 89 million Americans don't participate in the workforce and 300,000 more dropped out this August. Barack Obama is building the largest public sector since World War II and, yet, our government governs nothing. Still, an intellectually exhausted Democratic Party proposes nothing new. If at first you don't succeed, keep trying until you are $20 trillion in debt and failure litters your streets. The rollout of the Obamacare website is but another symptom of an old, hierarchical bureaucracy incapable of keeping pace with the complexities of a modern, adaptive America. Healthcare.gov is the best old Washington can do, not the worst. While our world transforms itself through revolutions in energy, technology and communication, the ideologists of the left stagnate. Barack Obama's Democratic Party is intellectually exhausted. Their old Democratic Party has nothing up its sleeves but more of the same. How our young President could only offer such dated ideas will be studied for decades. For now, we can mark candidate Obama's transformation from agent of hope and change to defender of liberal calcification as one of the great sleight-of-hand tricks in political history. With any luck, he will be the last President who tried to teach our dinosauric public sector to dance to the music of a new and adaptive era. Others, beyond Obama, will not expand but instead transform what we now pretend ""governs"" us. As for his legacy, today's tweeters and texters will remember Barack Obama as the last President of the Industrial Age and once he is gone, there will be no cover for his party's intellectual barrenness. Obama will leave a Democratic Party epitomized by ancient ideas, radically positioned left of our political center. The political trouble Barack Obama inherited from George W. Bush is nothing compared to what Obama has teed up for a future contender such as Hillary Clinton. Our former secretary of state has had no choice but to campaign for president earlier than she would have chosen. Clinton can see that this radicalized Democratic Party could easily leave her behind and find another champion. It did so before, to her distress, in 2008. No other member of the old Democratic elite can possibly hold its left-sliding legions together, yet Hillary Clinton has only one credential that appeals to her party: She could be our first female president. Elizabeth Warren's growing followers, more in tune with today's radicalized, populist Democrats, are likely to find that distinction unimpressive. If Clinton's rationale begins to fray, all hands on deck: The Democratic Party's 2016 nomination process is going to look like the casting call for ""One-Flew-Over-The Cuckoo's Nest."" Howard Dean may have screamed his way past the Democratic nomination in 2004, but the revolution he started has borne fruit. The 2016 nomination battle may be a fight between Elizabeth Warren, Governors Martin O'Malley and Deval Patrick, an unpolished pack of ideological duds and even a reinvigorated Dean, all vying to out-crazy each other and take the Democratic Party over a precipice. They'll make the troupe that sought the 2012 GOP nomination look like the committee awarding the Nobel Prize for Physics. Which party is more extreme? A Republican Party divided between 180 mainstream House members and 40 Ted Cruz mini-me's? Or a Democratic Party united to preserve our fossilized, ineffective public sector? A Republican Party advocating a path to fresh, natural, economic growth? Or a Democratic Party offering young voters the outdated economics of conformity, artificially imposed by Washington's elites? A Republican Party being driven to offer change? Or a Democratic Party united against it? Entrepreneurs, start printing tie-died shirts now. They will be hot sellers at the next Democratic Convention. Both sides are in for an interesting ride, but for Democrats, it's going to be an extreme 2016. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Castellanos.","Alex Castellanos: While everyone focuses on GOP's right, the Democrats are being ignored .

"(CNN) -- Saddam Hussein let the world think he had weapons of mass destruction to intimidate Iran and prevent the country from attacking Iraq, according to an FBI agent who interviewed the dictator after his 2003 capture. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in an unknown location in Iraq after his capture in 2003. According to a CBS report, Hussein claimed he didn't anticipate that the United States would invade Iraq over WMD, agent George Piro said on ""60 Minutes,"" scheduled for Sunday broadcast. ""For him, it was critical that he was seen as still the strong, defiant Saddam. He thought that (faking having the weapons) would prevent the Iranians from reinvading Iraq,"" said Piro. During the nearly seven months Piro talked to Hussein, the agent hinted to the Iraqi that he answered directly to President Bush, CBS said in a posting on its Web site. ""He told me he initially miscalculated ... President Bush's intentions. He thought the United States would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four-day aerial attack,"" Piro said. ""He survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack."" ""He didn't believe the U.S. would invade?"" Correspondent Scott Pelley asked. ""No, not initially,"" Piro answered. Once it was clear that an invasion was imminent, Hussein asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks, Piro said. ""And at that point, it would go into what he called the secret war,"" the agent said, referring to the insurgency. But Piro said he was not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of Hussein's plan. ""Well, he would like to take credit for the insurgency,"" he said. Hussein had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that, Piro said. ""He wanted to pursue all of WMD ... to reconstitute his entire WMD program."" Hussein said he was proud he eluded U.S. authorities who searched for him for nine months after the U.S.-led invasion, Piro said. ""What he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us,"" Piro said. ""He told me he changed ... the way he traveled. He got rid of his normal vehicles. He got rid of the protective detail that he traveled with, really just to change his signature."" Hussein was hanged in 2006.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A northwest Montana town where asbestos contamination has killed more than 200 people will get more than $130 million in cleanup and medical assistance from the Obama administration, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday. Libby, Montana, will  get new help dealing with asbestos contamination. The declaration is the first issued by the agency, which has grappled with the ""toxic legacy"" of a mine outside Libby, Montana, since 1999, Administrator Lisa Jackson said. The town was heavily contaminated with asbestos-laced dust that federal prosecutors said resulted in more than 200 deaths and 1,000 illnesses. ""For decades, the disease and death rate from asbestosis in the Libby area was staggeringly high -- much higher than the national average,"" Jackson told reporters. Not only did dust from the mine spread all over Libby and the neighboring town of Troy for decades, but tailings from the facility also were used as fill for driveways, gardens and playgrounds, she said. ""Literally no matter where these residents turned, they were being exposed yet again,"" Jackson said. She said the declaration ""should be a reminder of the serious consequences of mismanaging hazardous material."" EPA spokeswoman Adora Andy said $6 million from the Department of Health and Human Services will go to local health care providers to screen, diagnose and treat asbestos-related illnesses, while $125 million will go toward cleaning up contaminated areas. The new commitment brings the total amount the EPA has designated for the Libby area to $333 million, she said. The agency still needs to conduct ""significant research"" into the health effects of the type of asbestos that has been spread around town since the 1920s, she said, and does not yet know how many properties will need to be cleaned up. During Jackson's confirmation hearing in January, Montana Sen. Max Baucus said the valley's 12,000 residents had been ""hung out to dry"" and pressed Jackson to review the issue. Wednesday, Baucus presented Jackson and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius with a photo of one of his constituents, former miner Les Skramstad. ""He died, and others in Libby have died,"" said Baucus, a Democrat. ""But the decision is the beginning of what needed to be done. It's the first time in American history that we've had this declaration, and I cannot think of a more fitting time and place for it than Libby, Montana."" Baucus is the former chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and now leads the Finance Committee. He is a key architect of a still-being-drafted health care bill the Obama administration has said it wants to see pass this year. The Libby operation began producing vermiculite -- a mineral often used in insulation -- in 1919. Dust from the plant covered patches of grass, dusted the tops of cars and drifted through the air in a hazy smoke that became a part of residents' daily lives. But the product was contaminated with tremolite asbestos, a particularly toxic substance that has been linked to mesothelioma, a cancer that can attack the lining of the lungs, abdomen, or heart. In May, a federal jury acquitted mine operator W.R. Grace and three of its former executives of criminal charges related to the contamination. Grace operated the facility from 1963 until it closed in 1990, and prosecutors argued that its executives knowingly released the substance and tried to hide the danger from the community. Baucus said that despite the verdict, he still believes the company ""knew it was contaminating the town."" ""Regrettably, the trial did not conclude the way I thought that it should,"" he said. There was no immediate response from the company to the senator's remarks. During the three-month trial, Grace did not deny that the asbestos came from its mine, but it said it acted responsibly to clean up the contamination. It also paid millions in medical bills for area residents, and agreed in 2008 to pay $250 million to reimburse the EPA for its cleanup efforts.","Environmental Protection Agency declares health emergency in Libby, Montana .

"(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, arrived in Libya Saturday to visit with the country's post-Gadhafi leaders. Libya's National Transitional Council will use the one-day visit by al-Bashir to discuss ""unsettled matters"" between the two countries, NTC member Mohammed al-Sayeh told CNN. During the uprising in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi hired mercenaries who came from the Darfur area in Sudan to the Libyan border, al-Sayeh said. As the conflict tilted in favor of the rebels, al-Bashir tried to stop mercenaries from coming through and gave the Libyan rebels some guns and tanks, he said. There is also the issue of illegal immigration from Sudan into Libya through the country's southern border, al-Sayeh said. ""We had a lot of unsettled matters that we had to discuss with President Bashir,"" he said. Libyan authorities, however, have no intention of handing al-Bashir over to the International Criminal Court, where he is wanted for crimes committed in Darfur. Gadhafi, who the Libyan rebels killed after capturing, was also wanted by the ICC. The new Libyan authorities said they are willing to work with the ICC on cases involving Libyans. Richard Dicker, Human Rights Watch's director of the international justice program, said by not turning over al-Bashir to the court, it breaks the spirit of cooperation with the ICC. ""Welcoming to their capital a head of state accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes is deeply disturbing in what it suggests about the new Libyan authorities' commitment to human rights and the rule of law,"" Dicker said.

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A German court Monday refused to intervene in the case of Bishop Richard Williamson, who is facing prosecution for denying the Holocaust -- a crime in Germany. Bishop Richard Williamson, shown in the recent Swedish TV interview, has been removed from his seminary post in Argentina. Williamson asked the court to order Swedish Public Television to restrict broadcast of an interview in which he doubts the existence of Nazi gas chambers and a systematic Nazi plan to annihilate European Jewry. Williamson sought the help of the court because Holocaust denial is punishable in Germany only if it is publicized there. The court refused the request, it announced Monday. His lawyers argued that giving an interview to a Swedish television station did not constitute denying the Holocaust in Germany -- although he was physically in the country when he made the remarks. Williamson hit the headlines last month when he and three other ultra-conservative bishops were welcomed back into the Roman Catholic Church, more than 20 years after Pope John Paul II excommunicated them on a theological question unrelated to the Holocaust. The state court of Nuremberg-Fuerth ruled that the bishop would have had to notify Swedish reporters of any restrictions before the interview. According to the court, Williamson also wanted the interview removed from the network's Web site. The court said it is clear that the Swedish network is available on satellite in many countries and that he knew they had a Web site which can be seen around the world. A German district attorney announced February 4 that he had launched a criminal investigation against Williamson on January 23. Regensburg District Attorney Guenther Ruckdaeschel said authorities are investigating whether his remarks can be considered ""inciting racial hatred."" Denying the Holocaust in Germany is punishable by up to five years in prison. ""I believe that the historical evidence is strongly against -- is hugely against -- six million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler,"" Williamson said in the interview, which also appeared on various Web sites after broadcast. ""I believe there were no gas chambers."" Williamson and three other bishops who belong to the Society of Saint Pius X were excommunicated in 1988. The society was founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebrve, who rebelled against the Vatican's modernizing reforms in the 1960s, and who consecrated the men in unsanctioned ceremonies. The rehabilitation of Williamson sparked harsh condemnation from Israel, American Jewish leaders and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, among others. The Vatican has pointed to several statements by Pope Benedict XVI in the past few years condemning the destruction of European Jewry, including his visits to concentration camps. He has also said he did not know of Williamson's views on the Holocaust when he lifted the excommunication. The Vatican has said Williamson will not be allowed to perform priestly functions until he recants his Holocaust denial. He has apologized for ""distress"" his remarks caused the pope, but he has not retracted them. On Sunday, Merkel phoned Pope Benedict about the issue, though neither side seemed to have shifted its position over Williamson. In addition, Williamson was removed over the weekend as head of a seminary in Argentina. The views of Bishop Williamson, who has led the seminary in La Reja since 2003, do not reflect those of The Society of St. Pius X, said Christian Bouchacourt, head of its Latin American chapter. Bouchacourt said, in effect, Williamson had no business discussing the Holocaust issue. ""It's obvious that a Catholic bishop cannot talk with the ecclesiastical authority but to things related to faith and morality,"" Bouchacourt said in a written statement.","Bishop Richard Williamson loses bid to restrict access in Germany to a TV interview .
He told Swedish TV he did not believe there was a Nazi plan to wipe out Jews .
He wanted Swedish TV to be banned from airing interview in Germany or on Internet .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama recast the U.S. fight against terrorism as no longer a ""boundless global war"" but a targeted effort to dismantle specific extremist networks. He said America was at a ""crossroads"" and should no longer see it as a ""self-defeating"" perpetual fight, but one that must at some point end, ""like all wars."" Obama said ""the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on a path to defeat,'' but its affiliates elsewhere pose dangers. He also touched on new overseas and homegrown threats, and explained publicly the use of drones against terror suspects overseas. Obama: U.S. will keep deploying drones -- when they are only option . He renewed his push to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also sought to calm criticism around his administration's investigation of national security leaks. Obama, 'troubled' by leak investigations, asks for review . He even paused his prepared remarks to take on a woman in the audience from ""Code Pink"" who interrupted him several times in open disagreement. Obama interrupted . ""I think that the, and I'm going off script as you might expect here .... the voice of that woman is worth paying attention to,"" Obama said to applause. ""Obviously I do not agree with much of what she said and obviously she wasn't listening to me in what I said but these are tough issues and the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong."" Here are five things we learned from the speech: . 1. Using drones are OK, but... The Obama administration for the first time revealed Wednesday that drones had killed four American citizens since 2009. Obama used the speech to more definitively explain the U.S. policy on the use of lethal force and sought stricter review of its use. Still, he said drones were both legal and effective to combat terrorists, and added that Americans overseas who wish to do the United States harm were fair game, in the most extreme cases. ""When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America -- and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens; and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot -- his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team,"" Obama said. He said ordering strikes is a heavy burden, but added that ""to do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties."" Obama said he is asking his administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of war zones that go beyond reporting to Congress. CNN's senior political analyst Gloria Borger says Obama defends the use of drones. ""But he also really acknowledged that it can be overused, even by a president, and that you cannot just depend on drones for your national security."" 2. I wasn't kidding about closing Gitmo... When he was first elected in 2008, Obama vowed to shut down the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, also known as Gitmo. But in the years since, Congress has enacted significant restrictions on the transfer of detainees from the prison that made its closure impractical. And, as costs of running the facility balloon and detainees wage hunger strikes protesting their imprisonment, the administration has quietly dialed back the intensity of the push to shut down the facility. But that changed Thursday. ""The original premise for opening GTMO -- that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention -- was found unconstitutional five years ago,"" said Obama. ""In the meantime, GTMO has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law."" He called on Congress to ""lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO,"" appointed a special envoy to ""achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries,"" and lifted the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, where 56 of Gitmo's 86 detainees are from. At Guantanamo, a costly confinement . Daily life at Guantanamo: Hunger strikes, sprays of filth . 3. No leaks, but there's that freedom of the press thing... Obama has come under fire for recent investigations into leaks by his Justice Department where phone records were seized from reporters and editors at The Associated Press and a Fox News reporter was labeled in a Justice Department affidavit as ""potentially being an 'aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator'"" to the crime of disclosing secret information. Justice Department tracked Fox News reporter's e-mail, movements . So he used the speech to try to quell criticism for those intrusions. ""As commander-in-chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field,"" Obama said. ""But a free press is also essential for our democracy. I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable."" ""Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law,"" he added. He vowed to push for a federal shield law for journalists and convene a group of media organizations to review existing guidelines about investigations that involve reporters. 4. A new term brings a new policy . Obama clearly used the speech to redefine U.S. policy on the so-called ""war on terror,"" acknowledging that where once the battle was fought on foreign soil, the threats have moved. ""Now make no mistake: our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. We must recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. With a decade of experience to draw from, now is the time to ask ourselves hard questions - about the nature of today's threats, and how we should confront them."" ""From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions we are making now will define the type of nation -- and world -- that we leave to our children,"" Obama said. ""I was listening to a president who was saying to us, 'Let's get beyond where we were when I first took office, and let me tell you how my thinking has evolved since I've been president of the United States,'"" said CNN's senior political analyst Gloria Borger. ""He said, 'We must define the nature and scope of this struggle or it will define us.'"" But Obama will face opposition as he attempts to shift U.S. policy. ""Both on drones and on Guantanamo, he's going to get some pushback,"" said Borger. 5. Free speech also means 'you listen' A loud woman interrupted the president several times during his speech, calling on Obama to close the Guantanamo Bay facility. But the president was talking about just that when he was interrupted. ""You are commander-in-chief -- you can close Guantanamo today,"" she yelled. ""It's been 11 years!"" Obama stopped in the middle of his remarks and shot back. ""This is part of free speech, is you being able to speak but also you listening and me being able to speak, alright?"" Obama said. The woman was identified as Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of the protest group Code Pink and was later escorted out of the building and released. Photos: The face of Code Pink . Later, he even tweaked his closing line to incorporate the heckler in the audience. ""Victory will be measured in parents taking their kids to school, immigrants coming to our shores, fans taking in a ballgame, a veteran starting a business; a bustling city street, a citizen shouting their concerns at a president,"" he concluded. CNN's Kevin Liptak, Elise Labott, Chris Lawrence, Barbara Starr and Dan Merica contributed to this report.","Obama says America at ""crossroads,"" and fight against terror must be more targeted .

"Romulus, Michigan (CNN) -- Part of an explosive device that failed to take down a plane last week was sewn into the underwear of the Nigerian man accused of igniting it, a law enforcement official told CNN Monday. Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab is being held for allegedly trying to blow up a flight carrying 300 passengers on Christmas Day. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility Monday for the attack, saying it was in retaliation for alleged U.S. strikes on Yemeni soil. In a message written in Arabic, dated Saturday and published Monday on radical Islamist Web sites, the group hailed the ""brother"" who carried out the ""heroic attack."" The group said it tested ""new kind of explosives"" in the attack and hailed the fact that the explosives ""passed through security."" ""There was a technical problem that resulted in a non-complete explosion,"" the message said. A preliminary FBI analysis found that the device AbdulMutallab is said to have carried aboard the flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate, an explosive also known as PETN. The amount of explosive was sufficient to blow a hole in the aircraft, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Sunday. In his first public comment since the Christmas Day incident, President Obama said he directed his national security team to ""keep up the pressure on those who would attack our country."" ""We do not yet have all the answers about this latest attempt, but those who would slaughter innocent men, women and children must know that the United States will do more than simply strengthen our defenses,"" Obama told reporters in a break from his Christmas holiday in Hawaii. U.S. investigators have not determined whether the al Qaeda claim of responsibility was true, but one U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN on Monday that the group might have some involvement. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said that if al Qaeda operatives in Yemen were behind the Christmas plot, that would represent a significant advance for the group. ""Most of the attacks we have seen in the past have been in Yemen or Saudi Arabia, and the [al Qaeda] affiliate there has not been able to do out-of-the-area operation,"" Bergen said. A federal security bulletin obtained by CNN said AbdulMutallab claimed the explosive device used Friday ""was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used."" Yemen's government launched airstrikes and other raids against al Qaeda operatives on its territory over the past two weeks, and Monday's statement by al Qaeda accused the United States of assisting with cruise missile attacks launched from offshore. U.S. officials privately acknowledge they have provided secret intelligence on several al Qaeda targets to Yemen's government but won't say whether U.S. aircraft or drones took part in the strikes. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula threatened further attacks in its statement, saying, ""We have prepared men who love to die."" ""By God's permission, we will come to you with more things that you have never seen before,"" it said. Yemen's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Friday's attempted attack in a statement released Monday. ""Yemen has long suffered from terrorism and condemns such criminal acts that kill innocent civilians. Yemen is and remains an active partner of the international community in the war against terrorism. Efforts of Yemeni security agencies to continue ongoing operations and prosecutions against terrorist operatives from al Qaeda will not falter,"" it said. Mohammed Albasha, spokesman for the Yemen Embassy in Washington, confirmed to CNN Monday that AbdulMutallab was in Yemen between August and December. According to the ministry's statement, AbdulMutallab had obtained a visa to study Arabic at a language institute in Yemen where he had previously studied. Relatives of the suspect said Monday that they told authorities weeks ago about AbdulMutallab's ""out of character"" behavior and hoped authorities would intervene. AbdulMutallab, 23, was studying abroad when he ""disappeared"" and stopped communicating with his relatives, they said in a statement. His father, Umaru AbdulMutallab, contacted Nigerian security agencies two months ago and foreign security agencies six weeks ago, the statement said. A senior U.S. administration official said one of those agencies contacted was the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria. The embassy, which has law enforcement, security and intelligence representatives on staff, reported the father's concern to other agencies, the official said. ""We were hopeful that they would find and return him home,"" the family said. ""It was while we were waiting for the outcome of their investigation that we arose to the shocking news of that day."" AbdulMutallab, a Nigerian who had a multiple-entry visa to the United States, had been added to a watch list of 550,000 potential terrorist threats after the information provided by his father was forwarded to the National Counter-Terrorism Center, a senior administration official said. But ""the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no-fly list,"" the official said. Obama said Monday he has ""ordered a thorough review, not only of how information related to the subject was handled, but of the overall watch-list system and how it can be strengthened."" Do you feel safe in the skies? The father of the suspect contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria with concerns his son had ""become radicalized"" and was planning something, a senior U.S. administration official said. ""After his father contacted the embassy recently, we coded his visa file so that, had he attempted to renew his visa months from now, it would have triggered an in-depth review of his application,"" a U.S. official said. Passengers on the Christmas Day flight described a chaotic scene that began with a popping sound as the plane was making its final approach, followed by flames erupting at AbdulMutallab's seat. The suspect was moved Sunday from a hospital, where he was treated for his burns, to an undisclosed location in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. He is charged with attempting to destroy the plane and placing a destructive device on the aircraft. Authorities have focused their investigation on how AbdulMutallab, 23, allegedly smuggled the explosives aboard the flight and who might have helped him. ""We're ascertaining why it was that he was not flagged in a more specific way when he purchased his ticket, given the information that we think was available, allegedly was available,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CNN's ""American Morning"" Monday. Meanwhile, tighter security measures in the wake of the incident triggered long lines at security checkpoints at airports in the United States and abroad. Airlines and their crews have been given discretion over implementation of a ""one-hour rule,"" which prohibits passengers from leaving their seats during the last hour of flight, sources said. The Transportation Security Administration invoked the rule for international U.S.-bound flights after the botched attack. Airline security will be the focus of hearings by the Senate committees on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Commerce, Science and Transportation; the House Committee on Homeland Security is also slated to hold a hearing on the incident. AbdulMutallab's trip originated in Lagos, Nigeria. There, he did not check in a bag as he flew on a KLM flight to Amsterdam, said Harold Demuren, director-general of Nigeria's Civil Aviation Authority. Demuren said the suspect underwent regular screening -- walking through a metal detector and having his shoulder bag scanned through an X-ray machine. He then underwent secondary screening at the boarding gate for the KLM flight, according to officials of the Dutch airline. After arriving in Amsterdam, AbdulMutallab boarded the Northwest Airlines flight to the United States. The Netherlands' national coordinator for counterterrorism told CNN that AbdulMutallab had gone through ""normal security procedures"" in Amsterdam before boarding the flight to Detroit.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- They stepped onto the evening ferries in Hong Kong's crowded harbor to watch the sky light up with fireworks to celebrate China's National Day. Instead, the night ended in chaos and tragedy. Two ferries collided Monday night, upending one of the vessels and sending passengers into the water. At least 38 people died. Rescuers picked up 123 survivors and are still searching for a countless number of others who are missing. Passengers on board the ferries said they had only moments to escape. ""First it was up to here and then here. The water rose so quickly,"" one woman, who declined to be named, told CNN affiliate i-Cable. ""We thought we were going to die for sure."" The boat rolled violently before it partially sank. ""I opened the window and pushed a child out. I put a life jacket on him and pushed him out first,"" he told i-Cable. ""At the time, it was very chaotic. The boat was completely standing straight up in the water. It was chaotic. All the tables and chairs were everywhere. It was like a slide; everything was sliding down."" Read more: Survivors recount chaos, horror of ferry collision . Authorities are investigating what caused the crash, Hong Kong's most lethal maritime accident in more than 40 years. Police have arrested seven crew members from the vessels on suspicion of endangering passengers. The collision involved a passenger ferry traveling from Hong Kong Island to Lamma Island and a vessel owned by the Hong Kong Electric Company, which was carrying company employees and their families to watch the scheduled fireworks display. Government officials said it occurred off Lamma's coast about 8:20 p.m. Photos: Deadly Hong Kong ferry crash . ""I thought we'd hit a rock or a lighthouse,"" said Chris Head, a teacher who was on the passenger ferry. He said the vessel went from what felt like full speed to ""an abrupt halt."" Head said the force of the impact threw him out of his seat at the back of the ferry, which was not very full of people. As the damaged ferry began to move toward a pier in the small town of Yung Shue Wan on Lamma, Head said, he could see the other boat had started to sink into the water vertically, like the Titanic. ""It was very dark,"" he said. ""There were very few lights on board."" According to the Hong Kong Fire Services Department, which led the rescue, the vessel began to sink quickly after the impact. It said low visibility and many obstacles on board made work difficult for rescuers. ""After 10 minutes out, a boat crashed into ours from the side at very high speed,"" one male survivor from the accident told the South China Morning Post, a local newspaper. ""The rear of the ferry started to sink. I suddenly found myself deep under the sea. I swam hard and tried to grab a life buoy. I don't know where my two kids are."" Residents on Lamma, a lightly populated island southwest of Hong Kong Island, reported being awakened in the middle of the night by the massive rescue operation going on offshore. Were you there? Share your stories, images and videos. On Tuesday, the front of the stricken vessel was still sticking out of the water, tethered to a barge equipped with a crane just a few hundred meters from the coast of Lamma. Emergency services boats surrounded the scene, and divers conducted a search. Despite a hole torn in its bow, the passenger ferry was able to dock safely after the crash. Government officials have not confirmed whether passengers aboard that vessel were injured, but Head said nobody around him appeared to have been hurt. The narrow sea lanes leading into Hong Kong's main deepwater harbor are some of the busiest in Asia, with giant commercial freighters, ocean liners, passenger ferries and private boats of all sizes sharing the waters. Hong Kong is home to more than 200 outlying Islands, including Lamma. Hong Kong Island is on the south side of Victoria harbor, with Kowloon forming its northern shore. North of Kowloon lie the New Territories, which stretch all the way to mainland China. Monday's crash is Hong Kong's most lethal maritime accident since 1971, when 88 people died after the ferry Fat Shan capsized between Hong Kong and Macau amid a typhoon.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 69 years ago, Theodore ""Dutch"" Van Kirk navigated a U.S. B-29 Superfortress called the Enola Gay over Hiroshima, Japan, on a sunny August day. Once over its target, the Enola Gay unloaded the first atomic bomb dropped in war. A single bomb blast killed some 140,000 people and helped end World War II -- and pushed the world suddenly into the nuclear era. On Monday, Van Kirk died of natural causes at the Park Springs retirement community in Stone Mountain, Georgia, according to his eldest daughter Vicki Triplett. He was 93. His death means there are now no surviving members of the Enola Gay's crew who, by doing their jobs, became an early and integral part in the ongoing narrative over nuclear weapons. World War II's atomic bombs . While in the U.S. military, Van Kirk flew dozens of missions in Europe and North Africa. Yet the history books will largely remember him and others aboard that B-29 for the morning of August 6, 1945. By then, Van Kirk had flown about 15 missions out of England and about 10 more out of North Africa. He then returned to the United States with new orders, training ""primarily to make the rapid turn and running away from the bomb,"" Van Kirk recalled decades later to CNN. They dropped the bomb dubbed ""Little Boy"" around 8:15 a.m. ""You didn't see anything except a bright flash and the airplane,"" Van Kirk recalled. ""You saw a white cloud hanging over the city. You saw the -- underneath the cloud the entire city was just entirely covered with smoke and dust, and it looked like a pot of boiling oil down there."" His first thought when the bomb fell was ""'God, I'm glad it worked ... Number two, the thoughts were, 'This war is over.' And that was good. That was good.'"" Three days later, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered soon after that, ending the bloody war in the Pacific and, in so doing, preventing a U.S. land invasion. Hiroshima atomic bomb memorial site attracts tourists, shares history with new generations . It also set the stage for what would become known as the Cold War -- a nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and United States that would go on for decades -- as well as concerns about developing nuclear weaponry that persist in places like North Korea and Iran to this day. Tom Van Kirk told CNN on Tuesday that his father ""felt no regrets about"" the Hiroshima mission. At the same time, he said ""Dutch"" Van Kirk's life was much more than that. After the war, Van Kirk left the military, got his master's degree in chemical engineering at Bucknell University, then had a long career working for DuPont. He retired in 1985 -- a decade after his wife's death -- and remained active, eventually settling in Georgia near one of his daughters. He will be buried in Northumberland -- the central Pennsylvania city in which he was born -- alongside his wife, Tom Van Kirk said. Together, the couple had four children, seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren. ""We treasure the fact that we had my dad for 93ÃÂ½ years,"" said Tom Van Kirk. ""He was a great father.""

"(CNN) -- University of North Carolina whistle-blower Mary Willingham did not just review numbers on a spreadsheet, she emphasized to CNN, but worked with the ""overwhelming majority"" of the athletes she analyzed in a study about literacy -- one that was summarily dismissed by university officials the same day. Her findings, that 8% of a sample of UNC students playing the money-making college sports of football and basketball were reading below a 3rd grade level, were met with scathing criticism by the university during a faculty council meeting Friday afternoon. In the meeting, Provost James Dean said the university's initial analysis of Willingham's research determined that she made a ""range of serious mistakes"" in how she arrived at the reading levels of the athletes she assessed. Dean said Willingham used the wrong measurement, and relied on data that isn't supposed to be used to determine the grade level of reading comprehension. A second independent analysis of her research will be sought, Dean said. ""Our judgment at this point is that claims made based on this data set are nearly meaningless and grossly unfair to our students."" The university has not explained why it did not do this analysis, or take the time to review her claims, prior to a CNN report on the literacy of college athletes. CNN had asked for comment on Willingham's study as early as September. Willingham said after the meeting: ""My data is 100% correct. In addition, I worked with the overwhelming majority of the students in the data set on reading and writing skills between 2004 and 2010."" Willingham's study was part of a report by CNN on UNC -- and dozens of other public universities -- and whether student-athletes in revenue sports are able to keep up with their peers academically. After meeting with university officials in the wake of the CNN story, Willingham got a letter informing her that her approval to research using university records was being pulled because she broke a rule related to having the identities of the athletes she was studying. She immediately said she would reapply to continue her research. ""It's interesting that my (permission to do research) was pulled and I was told that I could not talk about it until it was resolved. Meanwhile the provost is allowed to discuss the findings,"" Willingham said, talking about the rescinding of her permission to continue research. ""That is what is truly erroneous about all of this -- and at a research university -- wow. At UNC, we protect our brand at all costs."" ""The gap in academic preparedness between profit-sport athletes and students at NCAA (Division 1) institutions perpetuates educational inequality,"" Willingham said. ""Until we acknowledge the problem, and fix it, many of our athletes, specifically men's basketball and football players, are getting nothing in exchange for their special talents."" Willingham is one of just two people in the country CNN found who have researched the reading levels of student-athletes in the revenue-generating sports of football and basketball. In talking to CNN, she also shared several compelling stories about working with unnamed student-athletes who could not write, could not sound out multisyllabic words and who could not have read a paragraph when they started school at UNC. CNN also sought data from 37 other public universities. It asked for entrance exam scores of athletes on the SAT and ACT, because the kind of research that Willingham did is simply not available from other institutions. Since September, UNC has been aware of CNN's reporting and was asked to comment several times including on Willingham's research. The university said it could not comment on her findings or methodology. Not until after the story aired did the university release any data. On Thursday, it released an analysis of entrance exam scores that included all student-athletes --- not just the profit sport players. Based on that analysis, UNC said Willingham was wrong about the percentage of athletes who were not academically prepared for the rigors of college classes. Included in the UNC analysis was a disclosure that 34 football or basketball players since 2004 scored below a 400 on the SAT verbal test, or below a 16 on the ACT reading and English test. At those levels, experts have told CNN a student would not be able to read a college text book. UNC, again, disputes that expert opinion, and says all but four of those athletes are in, left in or graduated in good academic standing. It's not the first time UNC has faced questions about the quality of its academics for athletes. Two years ago, a scandal was unearthed where students, many of them athletes, were given grades for classes they didn't attend, and where they did nothing more than turn in a single paper. The local newspaper, The News & Observer, did extensive reporting on that no-show class scandal and, based on public records and interviews, uncovered how counselors with the athletes' tutoring program used the fake classes to help keep academically challenged athletes eligible to play sports. Willingham, who has been vocal in her criticism since that scandal was uncovered, informed the university of her latest research as far back as August.","UNC claims Mary Willingham made ""serious mistakes""

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams continued her miserable run at grand slam tournaments in 2014 crashing to defeat against France's Alize Cornet in the third round at Wimbledon on Saturday. The five-time champion, who lost in the second round at Roland Garros last month and in the fourth round at the Australian Open in January, looked to be on course for another routine win after taking the opening set 6-1 in a rain-interrupted match. But Cornet, who beat Williams earlier this year in Dubai, came storming back into the match taking the second set 6-3. With the initiative seized, Cornet drove home advantage opening up a 5-2 lead in the deciding set before Williams mounted a mini-revival to move within one game of her opponent at 5-4. But Cornet held her nerve in the tenth game serving out to love to seal victory against the world No. 1 in just over two hours. ""To beat Serena at Wimbledon, wow, it is just a dream,"" 24-year-old Cornet said. ""It is the biggest upset in the tournament because she is the world number one and has won here so many times. ""I thought it was going to be tough when I lost the first set but finally I did it. I can't believe that I did it myself. It is a great moment. I've been working so hard and this is the reward."" The 25th seed will now meet Eugenie Bouchard in the fourth round following the Canadian's straight set 6-3 6-4 win over Germany's Andrea Petkovic. Williams was left to ponder her earliest singles exit at Wimbledon since 2005 when compatriot Jill Craybas beat her at the same stage, but found time to praise her opponent. ""You know, she was going for her shots. She just played really well today,"" Williams said. ""I thought I was playing well. I worked really hard coming into this event. It's ok, though. Sometimes it happens. You work hard, but maybe it's not for today, maybe it's for tomorrow. ""But, yeah, so I've just got to keep going."" Williams quest for an 18th grand slam singles title will resume at Flushing Meadows in August. Only an handful of matches were completed on Saturday as rain swept across the grounds at SW19. Maria Sharapova dropped just three games against Alison Riske of the U.S. winning out 6-3 6-0 under the roof on Centre Court. The reigning French Open champion will now face ninth seed Angelique Kerber in the fourth round following the German's 3-6 6-3 6-2 victory over Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens. Simona Halep is also safely through to the second week after beating Switzerland's Belinda Bencic 6-4 6-1. The Romanian third seed, who was runner-up to Sharapova at Roland Garros, will play Zarina Diyas from Kazakhstan. Last year's beaten finalist, Sabine Lisicki was tied at one game all in the second set, after taking the opening set 6-4 against Serbia's Ana Ivanovic when play was stopped. The pair with resume their match on Monday. In the men's draw both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are safely through to the second week. Seven-time champion Federer was a straight sets (6-3 6-1 6-3) winner over Colombia's Santiago Giraldo. Tommy Robredo awaits Federer in the next round after the Spaniard, seeded 23, beat Jerzy Janowicz in five sets 6-2 6-4 6-7 (7/5) 4-6 6-3. Compatriot Nadal dropped the opening set for the third straight match before steamrollering Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan 6-7 (7/4) 6-1 6-1 6-1.

"(CNN) -- Recently, a federal judge blocked the enforcement and implementation of the indefinite military detention authority that Congress passed late last year as part of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act. It's a welcome sign from our courts that constitutional safeguards still exist. When this provision was debated last year, we argued that it was an unwise expansion of law that jeopardized the freedoms of all Americans. We were heartened that the court has wisely chosen to block this policy for much the same reason we opposed it. However, this federal court injunction is only temporary, and the debate over whether the military has the authority to indefinitely detain individuals captured on U.S. soil without trial is far from over. Earlier this year, we introduced legislation, recently co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, that would require that civilian law enforcement, including the FBI and civilian courts, take the lead with respect to those captured or detained in the United States. Some, however, have argued that this approach to national security -- one that involves law enforcement and not solely the military -- is tantamount to ceding ground to al Qaeda. This argument, designed to paint members of Congress as ""soft on terror,"" is wrong on two fronts. First, enemies who want to attack us on our native soil -- particularly would-be suicide bombers -- do not intend to be captured and are not lured to America by the identity of their potential jailer or prosecutor. The strange assertion that our civilian courts and law enforcement system serves as an incentive for terrorists to come to America ignores the terrorists' true motivations. The question of civilian versus military authority is irrelevant to our enemies. It is, however, incredibly important to protecting Americans' constitutional rights and freedoms while still allowing us to effectively fight terrorism. Second, our civilian law enforcement and justice system have worked exceptionally well in prosecuting, convicting and jailing dangerous terrorists. To say that the military is the only institution up to the task is an unfair indictment of the valiant work done by the men and women who have kept us safe since 9/11. We have convicted hundreds of terrorists in our federal civilian courts, with many of them incarcerated at the ""Supermax"" prison in Florence, Colorado. Yet military commissions in Guantanamo Bay have only resulted in seven convictions, and two of those terrorists have already been released. As Congress works to update our national defense policy and the courts continue to weigh the implications of allowing indefinite military detention without trial, we remain committed to defending our country from those who seek to do us harm, both abroad and here at home. The debate over protecting constitutional liberties alongside our counterterrorism efforts is not now and has never been an issue of rewarding terrorists -- just ask any inmate at Supermax. Rather, as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, FBI Director Robert Mueller and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper advocated during last year's debate, it's about giving our law enforcement community the maximum ability to protect us within our constitutional system. This is a system that guarantees freedom and liberty to the American people alongside their safety and security. Inviting our armed forces into our cities and towns with the power to indefinitely detain Americans without trial is a misguided attempt that erodes our rights to due process and limits the effectiveness of civilian law enforcement. This approach also would unnecessarily burden our military with a responsibility it does not want and, most importantly, does not make us safer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","A federal judge temporarily blocks law allowing indefinite detention of terrorism suspects .

"(CNN) -- There will be no room for homophobia at the 2014 NFL Draft, according to San Francisco 49ers owner and co-chairman John York. When the three-day event, taking place between May 8-10, rolls into town, much of the media's attention is likely to be focused on Michael Sam -- the former Missouri Tigers defensive end who came out as gay in February. The college football star is expected to be drafted in the latter rounds, and if so, he will become the first active player in the NFL to have publicly declared his homosexuality. A handful of teams are reportedly interested in recruiting the 24-year-old, and York insists that -- regardless of Sam's sexuality -- he would have him at the 49ers should he be deemed good enough. ""If he is the right person and we have a need at that position and he shows the capability on film, what his sexual orientation is would not matter in our locker room,"" York told CNN. Sam's decision to come out earlier this year means he joins the growing list of sports stars who have opted to reveal their homosexuality. Former German international footballer Thomas Hitzlsperger, Puerto Rican featherweight boxer Orlando Cruz and NBA player Jason Collins have all come out in recent years, however, they have decided to do so during the latter stages of their careers. A small number of NFL players, too, have chosen to come out in the past, but only once their professional careers had come to an end -- starting with David Kopay in 1975. The prospect of Sam becoming the first openly gay athlete in the league is simply a natural progression for the sport, according to York, given that Kopay's own admission occurred nearly 40 years ago. ""The truth of the matter is even though we haven't had players who are playing come out openly, we're further along in this curve than people want to make out,"" he said. ""I think it's just natural that there are players in any sport and in any other area of business that there are people of different orientations throughout the population."" Should Sam move on to the 49ers next month, he could find himself lining up next to Jonathan Martin, who has also had his own personal problems to deal with. Martin, who arrived in San Francisco from the Miami Dolphins last month, was the target of harassment and bullying from three former teammates. An independent report found the 24-year-old had been the victim of ""sexually explicit remarks"" and ""racial insults"" from Richie Incognito, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey, while it was revealed that Martin contemplated suicide as a result of their actions. But while there has been much sympathy for the offensive tackle in the weeks since, some have suggested he broke the locker room's code of silence -- a claim that York is quick to refute. ""No I don't believe so,"" he said. ""The locker room needs to be a professional atmosphere. ""Obviously there's an element of privacy that's in the locker room but there's also an element that needs to be professional and Jonathan will be a part of that professional locker room in the 49ers."" York added: ""There is a code of conduct that needs to be modeled everywhere, no matter where it is. People have to be treated with respect, with dignity and given the opportunity to maintain their own lives."" York feels the signing of Martin, who has worked with 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh in the past, is proof that his team is doing its best to further the NFL's boundaries. ""I think that we've played a role in that being the San Francisco bay area in trying to be a leader and recognizing that individual rights play a role within sports as they do in the rest of the world,"" he said. Expanding NFL's reach . While York is keen to further the NFL's boundaries when it comes to giving players room to express themselves for who they are, he is also committed to helping the sport expand overseas. The NFL's profile in England is continuing to grow, with London's Wembley Stadium having hosted the International Series since 2007, while there has even been talk of a franchise based in the nation's capital. The Jacksonville Jaguars -- whose owner Shahid Kahn also owns English Premier League side Fulham -- are reportedly the most likely to relocate to London. York, a former chairman of the NFL's international committee, believes a franchise in London would be a great way to boost the sport's popularity outside of the U.S., although he does not necessarily feel a team would need to relocate across the Atlantic completely. ""I don't think it will ever come down to that choice [of moving] because I think it's a totally different market. I think it will be fantastic to have a franchise in both Los Angeles and London,"" he said. ""[But] I think you're going to have to develop a new way to think about the way teams play."" York added: ""There are times where you play three games away [in a row] or you play three games at home [each season]. We look at that right now as a potential flaw in the schedule. ""But when you take a team and put them at the distance that London is from the west coast of the U.S., all of a sudden maybe that's not a flaw, maybe that's a good point.""","All eyes on Michael Sam ahead of May's NFL draft .

"(CNN) -- Administration officials have said that neither the U.N. Security Council nor the actions of allies would affect their response to Syria. Apparently producing conclusive evidence to link the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to the use of chemical weapons against the nation's citizens may not matter either. And yet even a brief review of 25 years of U.S. military action teaches the tragedy of ignoring law and facts. Just two years ago President Barack Obama recognized the need for a U.N. Security Council resolution to allow military action in Libya. Resolution 1973 authorized ""necessary measures"" to protect civilians. The resolution was needed because the use of military force is banned by the U.N. Charter unless it is in self-defense to an armed attack, has Security Council authorization, or, perhaps, is taken with the consent of a government fighting an insurgency, as in Afghanistan. Even officials from the George W. Bush administration recognized the need for a Security Council resolution when the United States and United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 2003. The two nations tried to recycle resolutions from the 1990-1991 Gulf War when it became clear Security Council members would not vote for a new resolution to attack Iraq. The case for war with Iraq was too weak; Security Council members wanted to give U.N. weapons inspectors more time. Secretary of State Colin Powell also tried to justify the Iraq invasion by referencing NATO's 1999 intervention in Kosovo, which also went forward without the required Security Council authorization. Authorization had been withheld because the Security Council doubted bombing would get the Serbs to grant Kosovo independence and were not sure who was responsible for some of the conflict's mass killings. Indeed, rebels have an interest in showing that they are victims in order to draw in assistance. Just a few years before the Kosovo intervention, President George H.W. Bush had declared a new world order under the rule of law. He could point with well-earned pride at how, in the Gulf War, the United States led a worldwide coalition, authorized by Security Council Resolution 678, to liberate Kuwait -- in 100 hours of combat. The United States received generous assistance to support its military action, with allies sending either troops, material or financial support. That war was fought against Saddam Hussein, the last known leader to have used chemical weapons in war. He used them to suppress Kurdish Iraqis and against Iranian soldiers during the Iran-Iraq War. He likely then used them against his own soldiers to cover up the use against Iranian troops when U.N. weapons inspectors came to investigate Iran's claims of chemical weapons use. Obama is right to speak against chemical weapons use in the most categorical of terms. But the use of chemical weapons is banned by international law. Responding by violating the international law ban on resorting to force will only undermine America's standing to condemn the crimes of others. Washington officials should put their prodigious talents and resources to use finding a lawful and effective way to respond to chemical weapons use in Syria and to aid in ending a tragic war without creating more tragedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Ellen O'Connell.","Mary Ellen O'Connell: U.S. says U.N. approval won't affect plans for response to Syria .

"(CNN) -- Jean Jennings Bartik, the last of six women programmers who debugged and operated the earliest general-purpose computer, has died. Bartik, 86, died Wednesday in New York, said Jon Rickman, vice president of information systems at Bartik's alma mater, Northwest Missouri State University, and director of the Jean Jennings Bartik Computer Museum. Bartik was profiled in a CNN.com story last month about women mathematicians who were recruited by the U.S. military to do ballistics research during World War II. Bartik and five of her fellow ""computers"" went on to program the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, but they didn't receive recognition for their work until years later. ""Jean is probably one of the most significant pioneers in computing,"" Rickman said. ""Jean worked hard and, as a woman in a man's world at that time, especially in the business world, it's amazing what she was able to accomplish."" Bartik graduated from Northwest Missouri State Teachers College in 1945 as the school's one math major. She recalled living on her parents' farm, refusing the teaching jobs her father suggested and avoiding all talk of marrying a farmer and having babies. Instead, she took a train to Philadelphia to work for the military. There, she learned ballistics calculations and was quickly hired to work on the ENIAC, created during the war by University of Pennsylvania scientists John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert Jr. Bartik and her colleagues debugged the computer, which weighed 30 tons, contained about 18,000 vacuum tubes and completed the same work the women ""computers"" did but in a fraction of the time. Bartik went on to work on the BINAC and UNIVAC computers and to work in the fledging high-tech publishing field. Her children and grandchildren all grew up to be good with numbers, she said in February. Bartik and the other ENIAC programmers didn't receive much attention for their work after WWII, but their story was recently featured in the documentary ""Top Secret Rosies: The Female Computers of World War II."" Bartik wrote an autobiography that is being edited; Rickman said he hopes it will be published this year. In 1997, Bartik was inducted into the Women in Technology Hall of Fame, along with her fellow ENIAC programmers, Kathleen McNulty Mauchly Antonelli, Frances Snyder Holberton, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Frances Bilas Spence and Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum. In 2008, Bartik was one of the Fellow Award honorees at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, along with Robert Metcalfe, an inventor of Ethernet, and Linus Torvalds, who began the development of the Linux kernel, or operating system. Northwest Missouri State University opened the Jean Jennings Bartik Computing Museum in her honor. ""I'm going to miss her terribly. It's such an end of an era,"" said Bill Mauchly, the son of ENIAC pioneers John and Kay Mauchly. After John Mauchly's death in 1980, Bartik and Kay Mauchly renewed their friendship and gave talks about their experience in the early days of computing. Both women wrote autobiographies, Bill Mauchly said, and remained close until Kay's death in 2006. ""(Bartik) was such a ball of fire and so much fun,"" Bill Mauchly said. ""They made a great team, because my mother was more demure. That's the part I remember, them traveling around like a traveling band, the Jean and Kay Show. They finally got to have their own little audience."" ""They're going to continue to be an example of women in technology from the very beginning. I think (Bartik) gave us what we needed to remember her by."" In February, Bartik said women hadn't gotten far enough in technology, but she saw a promising future. ""Women are busily working on it,"" she said. ""I have high hopes for them.""","Jean Bartik was among the women recruited to do ballistics calculations during WWII .

"(CNN) -- Relations between the Vatican and Ireland deteriorated sharply as the Holy See appeared to ignore a commission looking into complaints of physical and sexual abuse of children by Irish priests, according to U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks. One cable from earlier this year says the Vatican was angered by the way the Murphy Commission -- which was looking into the how complaints of abuse had been handled by the Church and Irish government -- sidestepped normal diplomatic channels. The commission had written directly to the Vatican to seek information and requested a meeting with the Vatican's representative in Ireland. The Vatican envoy did not respond, according to the cable. The cable was one of several published Friday by the Guardian newspaper in London. The Murphy Commission was appointed after another inquiry issued a report in May 2009 detailing horrific abuses, including 325 alleged cases of abuse by priests, and concluding that the problem was endemic. ""The Vatican believes the Irish government failed to respect and protect Vatican sovereignty during the investigations,"" the charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See, wrote in February 2010. ""Adding insult to injury, Vatican officials also believed some Irish opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply."" But the cable added: ""Much of the Irish public views the Vatican protests as pettily procedural and failing to confront the real issue of horrific abuse and cover-up by Church officials."" ""Resentment toward the Church in Rome remains very high, particularly because of the institutionalized cover-up of abuse by the Catholic Church hierarchy."" But U.S. diplomats credit the Vatican with responding to the unfolding crisis in Ireland ""with uncharacteristic speed."" ""The Vatican's relatively swift response to this crisis showed it learned key lessons from the U.S. sex abuse scandals in 2002 but still left some Catholics -- in Ireland and beyond -- feeling disaffected,"" the U.S. charge d'affaires wrote. Victims' associations were complaining at the time that Pope Benedict XVI had not issued an apology for the abuses and had not ordered the removal of the remaining bishop accused of the cover-up, even though he said he shared the ""outrage, betrayal, and shame"" of Irish Catholics. The following month the pope did offer an apology to the victims. ""You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry. I know that nothing can undo the wrong you have endured,"" he said. Looking to the longer term, the U.S. diplomat wrote that the prestige and power of the Irish Catholic Church had been falling ever since its peak with the 1979 visit of Pope John Paul II. The abuse scandals had come amid increasing secularization of society and might further reduce the influence of the Catholic Church, she wrote. ""Our contacts at the Vatican and in Ireland expect the crisis in the Irish Catholic Church to be protracted over several years, as only allegations from the Dublin Archdiocese have been investigated to date,"" the cable says.","Cable: Vatican was angered that commission sidestepped diplomatic channels .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration is sending letters to all 50 states warning that it will limit road construction spending beginning August 1 unless Congress acts to fund a dwindling federal trust fund that helps pay for such projects. For motorists, that could mean everything from renewed encounters with axle-crunching potholes to more congestion as traffic is managed more tightly on outdated bridges. For state and local governments, it means juggling infrastructure maintenance and upgrades with an unsteady source of funds to carry out those priorities. Like the situation involving many of the roads nationwide awaiting attention, there is nothing new going on here. The on-and-off legislative wrangling over related construction spending is another year older and like a lot of other things caught up in bitter partisan politicking in Washington, no closer to a resolution. Obama makes new pitch . President Barack Obama aimed on Tuesday ahead of the July 4 holiday travel period to make another pitch for Congress to boost investment in infrastructure spending to address pressing highway and transit needs and spur job creation. Obama proposed a long-term highway construction bill earlier this year. Other lawmakers have their own plans as well. Some are calling for a hike in gas taxes to help pay for federal transportation priorities. Others would like to see less government involvement and spending, and more private financing and creative financing approaches. The current two-year law allowing the government to send from the trust fund expires in September, a deadline that can be extended if more money is found. This is how road funding works now: Motorists pay gasoline taxes each time they go to the pump. The federal portion -- just over 18 cents per gallon -- goes into an account called the Highway Trust Fund. The money is mainly dedicated to projects spearheaded by individual states. These can include that highway widening job, repairing curbs on Main Street, and replacing a rusting bridge. Over the years, the trust fund balance has gone down sharply. The recession and high gas prices were blamed for people driving a lot less and the push for greater energy independence has led to more fuel efficient cars. This all means less money spent on gas and less money collected in related taxes. Over the years, the trust fund balance has fallen and now there's concern it will run out of money. Running low on money . The federal highway account started last October with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, and then received nearly $10 billion more from general tax revenues. At the start of June, the balance was roughly $8 billion, according to Transportation Department figures. The Transportation Department is now warning states that it will use a different method for distributing money to them once the fund balance dips below $4 billion in less than a month. Normally, they get reimbursed once an invoice is submitted, but now the money will go out as part of a new formula. States will instead get two installments in August -- one toward the middle of the month and another at the end. At the end of August or early September, the fund will reach zero. ""I believe this cash management plan is a sound one,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx wrote to state highway administrators. ""It treats all states equitably and provides you with as much certainty as we can in an uncertain situation. Will Congress act? But ""there is still time for Congress to act on a long-term solution,"" Foxx wrote. Similar spending for mass transit is also in rough shape, prompting a similar response from federal transportation officials. Moreover, summer is high season for road construction. Fox told CNN that congressional inaction would mean delays in road repairs Ã¢â¬â and traffic jams. ""Those potholes that you saw this winter, well we may not be able to see many of those potholes get fixed Ã¢â¬â or as many of them get fixed,"" Foxx said. ""But more importantly, I think is that congestion, travel times are lengthening in many parts of the country. They're getting longer. People are sitting in traffic longer, and the types of solutions that are needed to relieve that congestion are ones that are paid for by the Highway Trust Fund."" CNN's Jennifer Liberto and Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.","States being notified that the federal government will limit road construction financing .

"(CNN) -- NFL offensive lineman Richie Incognito has been on the defense since November after fellow Miami Dolphins player Jonathan Martin abruptly left the team citing emotional abuse by Incognito on and off the field. Incognito adamantly maintains the two were friends who just had a crass rapport, though an NFL-sanctioned investigation found racial slurs used by Incognito and sexually explicit messages about Martin's mother and sister constituted a ""pattern of harassment."" The report also concluded that the two developed ""an odd but seemingly close friendship."" Jonathan Martin-Richie Incognito investigation report released . Incognito took to Twitter in a series of messages on February 12 to clear his name, including: ""I'm ready to move on with my life and career. I've been dragged through the mud for months by my 'best friend'. #betrayed #railroaded."" He would publicly apologize online -- again -- to Martin less than five days later. The public beef has caused some to question Martin's toughness and others to examine the harsh environment of the pro sports locker room. But it's also worth acknowledging that the dynamic between Incognito and Martin isn't so rare -- many of us have been embroiled in what pop psychology would call a ""toxic friendship."" For Iz Zakaria's 21st birthday, her good friend of more than 10 years sent her a self-help book on dating -- effectively throwing a burning match into the powder keg that was their relationship since seventh grade. ""It seems tiny and ridiculous, but it came near graduation, when I was facing the prospect of being unemployed and moving back home,"" Zakaria, now 22, wrote in an e-mail to CNN from Brunei. ""It was a reminder of another part of life that I am failing at -- my love life."" Zakaria wrote about her ""toxic friendship"" and subsequent fallout on the Web journal Thought Catalog. She attributes her self-deprecating sense of humor and fear of confrontation, in part, to the pair's drawn-out, dysfunctional accord. ""Most of the time, she exploited that, she built on those jokes and got everyone to laugh at me,"" she says. ""She made me feel like I knew nothing, that I was a child and I was immature."" What you don't get about NFL bullying . What made the dynamic even more confusing, and complicated to stop, is that there were, of course, jolly times -- especially when nobody else was around to impress. But the dating book was the final chapter in their storied love-hate relationship. ""You can't keep victimizing yourself like that,"" she says. Communication expert Lillian Glass decided to pen the book ""Toxic People: 10 Ways of Dealing With People Who Make Your Life Miserable"" after hearing many tales like Zakaria's. ""The definition of friendship is admiration and respect, and if you don't have those two, you have nothing,"" Glass told CNN. When friends become bullies . There are two types of toxic friendships, says Glass: Those that start out toxic, and those that start to require a Hazmat suit over time. When a friendship starts out overly contentious or competitive, it's worth asking why you're pursuing it in the first place. You might be recreating an unhealthy pattern, perhaps modeling your relationship with a parent who belittled you as a stand-in for showing affection. ""Sometimes what we don't resolve, we repeat,"" Glass says. On the other hand, pals can simply evolve in opposite directions -- this is particularly true in friendships that have endured since adolescence. Change, though, isn't inherently a bad thing. It's more when there is a ""discrepancy in personality and values"" or a friend discourages success, says psychologist Irene S. Levine. Levine also wrote a book on prickly pacts, titled ""Best Friends Forever: Surviving a Breakup with Your Best Friend."" ""Since friendships are voluntary relationships, it makes no sense that they bring you down,"" she says. She stresses in the book that people make many friends in life but only a few stick for prolonged periods. Those long-standing bonds, Levine says, are particularly hard to navigate -- or end -- because of the significant losses in cutting ties. ""These people are like scrapbooks of our lives, collection of our memories. It's very nice to be able to reminisce and have someone know your roots and know you in a different phase,"" she says. An uncordial split could put mutual friends in an awkward situation. If the toxic friend's nature is spiteful or vengeful, there's also the potential that he or she could unleash a firestorm of secrets and confidences you shared through the years. But, Glass says, if that's their nature, they're probably already talking behind your back. ""Deny it or ignore it and distance yourself,"" she says. ""Then again, as they say, don't tell your best friend what you wouldn't want your worst enemy to know."" Short of ""dumping"" the friend, Levine suggests there are other ways to attempt to ease the tension: Take a break from the person by speaking and seeing them less frequently. If the other party is persistent or guilt-trips you for not being around, a little white lie about scheduling could be in order. Levine says it's nice to want to maintain a longtime connection, but if none of these fixes work, the offended party must find a way to end it. Although it might be hard to address awkwardness, try to be direct but ultimately kind. And never end a friendship impulsively. ""You really need to think very carefully before you do it,"" Levine says. ""There's no going back. People will never forget that conversation."" Are you or have you been in a toxic relationship? Did you make amends or call it quits? Share your experiences in the comments below.","The ""friend or foe"" dynamic between Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin isn't so rare .

"(CNN) -- The Vatican on Monday recalled its envoy to Ireland in the wake of a blistering report accusing church leaders of covering up extensive abuse of young people by priests. Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza was recalled to Rome ""for consultations with the (Vatican) Secretariat of State,"" the official Vatican Information Service said in citing a statement from the Roman Catholic Church's leadership. The move came in reaction to this month's release of the Cloyne report about ""allegations of abuse of minors by clergy ... and, in particular, in the wake of subsequent reactions."" Released July 13, the 421-page report into abuses in the diocese of Cloyne -- near the southern city of Cork -- demolished claims by the Catholic Church in Ireland that policies it put in place in 1996 had enabled it to get a handle on the problem. It details how complaints against 19 clerics in the diocese were dealt with between 1996 and 2009. It also accused Bishop John Magee, who was responsible for policing abuse in his diocese, of not backing the policy himself and failing to take action against abusers. The Vatican last week had promised action, with the Rev. Federico Lombardi, director of the Holy See press office, saying in a statement the church ""will respond appropriately."" He added the Vatican's aim is to promote the protection of children and restore ""an atmosphere of trust and collaboration in the Church and in society."" His comments came days after Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny launched a stinging attack. He claimed that the Cloyne report exposed the Vatican as seeking to frustrate an inquiry into child sex abuse for its own benefit, even after the scandal blew up worldwide. On listening to the evidence of humiliation and betrayal, Kenny said, ""The Vatican's reaction was to parse and analyze it with the gimlet eye of a canon lawyer ... this calculated, withering position being the polar opposite of the radicalism, humility and compassion upon which the Roman Church was founded."" The report exposed ""a tale of a frankly brazen disregard for protecting children,"" the prime minister added, as he praised the courage of the victims of abuse who had spoken out to investigators. Lombardi responded in a statement saying some criticisms of the Vatican went too far and ""demonstrate little awareness of what the Holy See has actually done over the years to help effectively address the problem."" One point of contention is a 1997 letter from the Vatican's envoy to Ireland that warns bishops to follow church law while investigating cases of suspected child sex abuse by priests. The envoy expresses ""serious reservations"" about requiring that such cases be reported to the police. That letter, since being revealed recently, has stoked harsh criticism in Ireland. Numerous Irish victims of sexual abuse, for example, wrote collectively in January that they are ""disgusted"" by the message. The Vatican, in turn, has called the letter ""deeply misunderstood.""","Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza is recalled to consult with Vatican officials, the church reports .

"(CNN) -- Latino activists said Monday they are planning a national ""day of action"" to protest President Barack Obama and demand an end to a controversial program involving local officials in immigration enforcement. Actions are scheduled for Tuesday in 10 U.S. cities, including Atlanta, New York, Houston and San Francisco. ""Since signaling a new course in our immigration policy a few weeks ago, President Obama has continued his aggressive persecution, jailing, and deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who he has labeled 'criminals' and whose lives are being destroyed through traffic violations and similar minor infractions,"" said Roberto Lovato of Presente.org, a Latino rights organization. Protesters want an immediate end to Secure Communities, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that seeks to find unauthorized immigrants who have criminal records and deport them. Federal officials have praised the program, arguing it allows authorities to catch criminals who would otherwise fall through the cracks. But critics say it results in the deportations of immigrants who are in the United States illegally but have no criminal arrest records. Tuesday's protests are timed to coincide with the airing of ""Lost in Detention,"" a PBS Frontline documentary about immigration detention and enforcement strategies. More than 1 million immigrants have been deported since Obama took office, activists say. The president won two-thirds of the Hispanic and Latino vote in the 2008 presidential election, according to national exit polls. Keeping that vote is key to his re-election chances. ""We will be mobilizing our community and educating them on how to fight back against abuses on the street, in prison and at the ballot box,"" said Adelina Nicholls of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, which is planning a town hall-type meeting in Atlanta on Tuesday. In an August 2 report, the Department of Homeland Security said Secure Communities was active in more than 1,500 jurisdictions across the country.","Actions are expected in 10 U.S. cities .

"(CNN) -- The head of the Irish Catholic Church, Cardinal Sean Brady, admitted Wednesday that the church's response to abuse had been ""hopelessly inadequate."" ""The church must continue to deal with the enormity of the hurt caused by abuse of children by some clergy ... and the hopelessly inadequate response to that abuse in the past,"" Brady said Wednesday. Church leaders must ""own up to and take responsibility for any mismanagement or cover-up of child abuse,"" he said. The cardinal also apologized for his role in the church's investigation into an abusive priest in 1975. ""I want to say to anyone who has been hurt by any failure on my part that I apologize to you with all my heart,"" he said at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh, Ireland. ""I also apologize to all those who feel I have let them down. Looking back I am ashamed that I have not always upheld the values that I profess and believe in,"" Brady said, according to a copy of the remarks released by Ireland's Catholic Communications Office. Has the Catholic Church reached a tipping point? The deeply Catholic country has been badly shaken by a government-backed report that found the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up child abuse by priests from 1975 to 2004. Child sexual abuse was widespread then, the report found. Pope Benedict XVI said Wednesday he has finished writing his official statement, or pastoral letter, on the child abuse scandal facing the Catholic Church in Ireland. He will sign the letter Friday and send it ""soon after,"" Benedict told the faithful in an address on St. Patrick's Day. ""My hope is that it will help in the process of repentance, healing and renewal,"" he said. Brady has been under fire over the investigation into the Rev. Brendan Smyth, one of the country's most notorious child-abusing priests. Cardinal haunted by handling of abuse case . Brady's office said Tuesday the cardinal -- then a priest and teacher with a doctorate in canon law -- had been asked to investigate two complaints against Smyth in 1975 but had no decision-making power. He reported his findings to Bishop Francis McKiernan, his office said, and McKiernan recommended Smyth get psychiatric help. But John Kelly, founder of Irish Survivors of Child Abuse, said Brady should not have remained silent about what he learned in the course of investigating Smyth, who later was convicted of dozens of counts of child abuse in both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Smyth died in prison. ""He's basically using the Nuremberg defense -- he was carrying out orders,"" Kelly said, in reference to the justification many Nazis used in their war crimes trials after World War II. There has been particular outrage over the revelation that two boys who filed complaints against Smyth were asked to sign confidentiality statements as part of Brady's investigation. The oaths of secrecy were ""to avoid potential collusion"" between the two boys as church officials investigated the case, the Catholic Communications Office said this week. Despite his criticism of Brady, Kelly said it would not necessarily do any good for the cardinal to resign. ""He's lost all moral authority to lead, but by replacing him, it won't resolve the problem,"" Kelly said, arguing the Vatican would ""just replace guys with other guys."" The best solution, he said, would be for the Roman Catholic Church to let secular authorities deal with accusations of abuse, rather than trying to handle them itself. ""They have to accept secular authority, and they can get on with the business of religion,"" Kelly said. ""It would be in the church's own interest. Resignations in themselves aren't the answer."" Four Irish bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the government-backed report. The pope has been under fire since it was revealed a priest suspected of abusing children was allowed to move into his diocese when he was Archbishop Joseph Ratzinger in Germany in 1980. The Archdiocese of Munich and Freising said in a statement Monday it must have been clear at the time that the priest -- whom multiple sources identified to CNN as Peter Hullermann -- was coming to get therapy for allegedly molesting children. He was convicted of abuse in 1986 after Ratzinger moved to Rome. Hullermann was suspended Monday. Hundreds of allegations of sexual or physical abuse of children by Catholic clergy have come to light in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands this year . CNN's Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin, Germany, contributed to this report.","Cardinal Sean Brady apologizes for his role in 1975 abuse investigation .

"(CNN) -- Start-ups are fighting a war for talent in Silicon Valley, and the companies that actively welcome men and women are going to win it. Smart companies don't recruit ""brogrammers."" The term brogrammer is a joke, of course. Male software engineers don't actually pop their collars, wear sunglasses and lift weights while writing code and share hot tubs with bikini-clad women. But the joke is funny for some people because it reflects a truth about a community where certain places exclude great talent in favor of frat house fun. The tech industry's testosterone level can make the thickest-skinned women consider a different career. But the rise of the brogrammer joke and its ensuing backlash has some benefits: It helps talented women choose worthy employers, it gives a name and face to a problem that plagues the industry and it publicly shames some of the most sexist offenders. In 1999, Google's Marissa Mayer almost didn't take the job at the all-male start-up because there were more women at another firm that made her an offer. If Mayer had just graduated from college today with offers from two equally compelling start-ups -- one all-male and one not -- it's clear which one she would choose. If you write software for a living and you're located in Silicon Valley, you have your pick of employment options at an array of tech start-ups -- yes, even in this economy. When a recruiter's pitch is: ""Wanna bro down and crush some code?"" -- like San Francisco-based Klout's was -- you get a sense of what that company is looking for. If you're a woman, it's not you. That's pretty sad, but it's not all bad. As a woman and a software developer, crossing Klout off the list of places where I might work helps me narrow my options. I'd rather find out that an employer glorifies young dudes before I take a position than afterward. That's one small way brogrammer culture is actually useful. It's a red flag for women engineers, product developers, designers, project managers, marketers, business development and PR specialists. It says: This is a company that you'd want to avoid. Conversely, companies that assemble inclusive teams are more likely to snag great hires of all stripes. Tech start-ups founded by women are few and far between, but they're highly attractive to female and male candidates who don't want to join a boys' club. Established companies with executives who are vocal about women's issues, such as Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, also have an advantage. (Sandberg's TED talk is one of my all-time favorite career advice presentations for women.) The spotlight on Silicon Valley's brogrammer problem has focused on some of the worst public offenders. I find sexism in 2012 corporate America appalling, but I'm also an optimist. The folks perpetuating this culture are probably not overt misogynists. Most of the time, they simply don't know any better. Path's Matt Van Horn ""feels terrible"" about the sexist comments he made during a conference presentation that caused disgusted attendees to get up and leave. Geeklist began a women in technology committee after mishandling the retraction of a promotional video that featured a scantily clad female dancer. Cynics would argue that apologies won't resolve the underlying problem. But humiliation is an effective behavior modifier. I don't think these people will make these mistakes again. Sometimes the road to enlightenment is paved with public shaming. And there's a bonus: Onlookers have real life examples of what not to do at their companies. The tech industry has always been male-dominated. But the perception of those men has changed. Billionaire geeks of Silicon Valley are no longer considered awkward nerds who can't get a date. Instead, they're superheroes, the protagonist in epic movies and biographies. A new generation of young people from all walks of life aspires to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. They'll want to work for the most attractive companies -- the ones who built welcoming, diverse teams. Brogrammer culture celebrates frat house values, youth over experience and men over women. In the war for hiring great talent, the companies that embrace this culture rather than reject it will lose. That's a good thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gina Trapani.","Silicon Valley has a problem with brogrammer culture of frat house fun .

"London, England (CNN) -- A specter is haunting Eastern Europe: the ghost of Communism past. Twenty years after the collapse of Soviet-backed communist governments across the bloc, symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall, support for multiparty democracy has fallen in almost every country in the region, according to a wide-ranging new study. Majorities still support democracy over communism in all but one of the nine countries in the survey, but only two nations have seen a rise in approval for democracy. And support for capitalism as an economic system has fallen in every single country surveyed. Eastern Europeans do embrace democracy and capitalism in principle, one of the survey directors said, but they are frustrated in practice. ""They are frustrated with the way democracy is working in their countries,"" said Richard Wike, associate director of the Pew Global Attitudes Project. ""They see a gap between the way they want things to work and the way they see things are working. ""We don't see people saying they don't want free speech, free press or competitive elections; we see people saying they want those things,"" Wike said. But ""they are unhappy with how things are working out."" Russians ""stand out in some ways in this survey,"" he said. ""They are less likely to say certain features of democracy are important,"" he explained. ""There is some nostalgia for the Soviet empire."" A clear majority of Russians say it is ""a great misfortune that the Soviet Union no longer exists,"" while just more than one in three Russians disagrees. Just under half say it is ""natural for Russia to have an empire,"" up from just over one in three who felt that way in 1991, the baseline year for the survey. Communist governments fell across Eastern Europe in 1989, as populations rose against systems that had controlled them since the end of World War II. The Soviet Union itself collapsed at the end of 1991 as its constituent republics, including Russia, declared independence from the Soviet state. Despite the drop in support for democracy and capitalism, more people everywhere across the formerly communist nations in the survey are satisfied with their lives now than they were in 1991. The numbers of satisfied people doubled or tripled across the region but did not become a majority in any country. The Czech Republic came closest, with 49 percent of people saying they were satisfied. That's up from just under one in four 18 years ago. The results were different in the former West Germany, which essentially absorbed its communist other half, East Germany, at great economic cost in 1990. There, the number of satisfied people fell slightly, from just over half to just under it. Even so, West Germans are about as satisfied as the Czechs and ahead of anywhere else in the region. Young people were happier than older people about the change from communism to capitalism in every ex-communist country in the survey. More educated people also tended to say things were better now than less educated people did. There is ""a mixed picture about how people view minority groups within their countries,"" Wike said. ""Fewer people in Germany today have negative views towards Turks, Jews and Roma [Gypsies], but there are still very high negative views about some ethnic groups -- particularly Roma and Jews -- in some parts of the region."" The findings come from a survey of 14,760 people in 14 countries -- most in Eastern Europe but also the United States and a few Western European nations -- by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, based in Washington. They compared results to a survey conducted in 1991 by a predecessor, the Times Mirror Center. Interviews were conducted in August and September.","Study: Most support democracy over communism in all but one of nine countries .

"Jiuquan, China (CNN) -- The first thing I noticed were the bicycles. Those who weren't riding them were walking. I was beginning to wonder if we'd taken a wrong turn. We were looking for China's super-secret space center. Our four-hour drive from Jiuquan in China's west had taken us past picture postcard fields and fish ponds framed by looming snow-capped peaks, through an oasis of green and finally across the arid Gobi desert. READ MORE: Spaceship blasts off from Gobi Desert . We had pushed through numerous military checkpoints and past cameras that flashed and took our picture as we sped past the seemingly endless shimmering sand hills. There should be no doubt we'd arrived at the right place, it just didn't feel like it. Atmosphere 'electric' If this really was the epicenter of China's space race, then why did it feel so relaxed? A few hours later I'd be in a room crammed with TV cameras and reporters where the atmosphere was electric in a weird sci-fi way. But at that moment on those narrow scrubbed and manicured streets it felt almost like a vacation town. Tiny restaurants pulsed bright inviting neon lights at us as we drove by. Even the small stores had a come hither and loiter awhile holiday village quality to them. Our hotel when we arrived was so new gardeners were still planting the flower beds, and builders' white sheets covered the new red carpet. Sadly, in this town that claims to offer the ultimate in uplift, space rockets, the elevator was not working. The porters however were only too happy to help. Easy charm . Indeed, that seems to sum up Jiuquan space center as the town is known; its easy charm and friendliness. It's not until you rub shoulders with the town's power brokers that you see sense the purpose of this place. In one of the low rise buildings, barely visible from the road behind rows of trees I met one such person. Rather I saw her, than actually met her. In a conference room crowded with journalists she strode in on a mission. No sense of holiday about her, she oozes work. As deputy director of the space mission that means she has the hopes of the nation riding on her shoulders. Little wonder everyone in the room paid attention to her words. Every question that came about the imminent launch of China's next manned mission to space she answered in precise, accurate and minute detail. Well, almost every question. For no matter how much I waved my hand and waited my turn, it never came. Space race . I suppose, after all, this is a Chinese event and why would they want to answer a question from the only Western reporter they'd invited to the launch? But space race, yes, I caught a whiff of it right there. Before the Long March 2F rocket topped by the Shenzhou 10 space capsule does take off on Tuesday, I am told I will get to the launch pad. No doubt I'll catch the urgency right there. China has taken great strides since its first manned space mission 10 years ago but it still lags the U.S. and Europe, who share the permanently manned international space station. Everyone will be wishing the Chinese mission luck as they thrust into the skies on the quest to help future generations. The blue spacesuited heroes I saw will spend 15 days orbiting the earth after docking with their own unmanned space station. While by comparison, Russia's Soyuz craft docks with the International Space Station just six hours after liftoff, the Chinese will take two days from takeoff to docking. But six hours or two days; it doesn't really matter. China is in space and the people of this town fully understand what that achievement means.","CNN's Nic Robertson is the only Western correspondent invited to China's scheduled rocket launch .

"(CNN) -- You could say that a simple pair of running shorts was the trigger that launched a multimillion-dollar business and radically shifted the lives of basketball coaches Susan Walvius and Michelle Marciniak. In August 2007, Walvius, who was then the head women's basketball coach at the University of South Carolina, and her assistant, Marciniak, had just finished a long day teaching at a summer basketball camp. They sat exhausted in the gym, looking forward to a good night's rest. Then Walvius -- thinking about her comfy running shorts -- experienced what she describes as an ""aha moment."" ""I looked at Michelle and said, 'I love this fabric, and I'd love to have bedsheets from this stuff.' Michelle said, 'Let's do it.' "" And with zero formal business experience, the two women stepped boldly into the world of entrepreneurship. They paired with South Carolina's International Business School to research the market, quit their coaching jobs, formed a business and took their battles from the basketball court to business boardrooms. ""The biggest similarity between coaching and what we do now is raising capital,"" said Walvius, who took USC's women roundballers to the Elite Eight for the first time in 2002. She compares raising capital to recruiting players. Instead of selling the school basketball program, they're selling bedding -- heavy on the marketing side -- complete with PowerPoint presentations and glossy poster boards. Their business -- SHEEX -- makes and sells ""performance"" sheets and pillowcases made from specialty fabrics that wick moisture and transfer heat. They sell online and at upscale sporting goods stores, trendy home stores and other retail outlets. After working together as coach and assistant coach for five years -- and now as business partners -- the duo has developed a kind of unwritten playbook for themselves. ""We're great friends, and we have different strengths,"" Walvius said. ""Susan and I complement each other really well during presentations,"" Marciniak said. ""If I get stuck, she fills in, and if she gets stuck, I fill in."" Crisscrossing the country to build their business team and garner support, the two often find themselves working together for 16-hour days, said Marciniak, who gained attention as an All-American point guard on the University of Tennessee's national championship team in 1996. Local media nicknamed Marciniak and a teammate ""fire and ice."" ""I look at this team in a similar way,"" Marciniak said. ""I bring a more 'fiery' personality to our team, where Susan brings a calmer one."" Meetings are very calm they say. The fire and ice come while grinding through  everyday decisions. Marciniak proved on the basketball courts of the WNBA that she can play with fire. In a 2002 altercation that's ranked by FOX as one of the ""most outrageous moments in sports,"" a player with the Los Angeles Sparks hit Marciniak in the face with the ball, prompting Marciniak to charge toward the player, who then knocked her to the floor. Both players were suspended and fined ""a couple thousand dollars,"" Marciniak said. Recently, during meetings for SHEEX, the fight has come up in business conversation several times. ""I am amazed how many guys see the fight after we meet with them and then comment on it during the next meeting or in a follow-up e-mail,"" Marciniak said. ""They think it's cool."" ""I just smile and tell my side of the story,"" she said. Eventually, Marciniak learned to channel and focus that intensity, her former boss said. ""Michelle isn't emotionally popping off in a meeting like she was on the basketball court,"" Walvius said. ""She was such an emotional basketball player, and it was one of the reasons why she was highly successful. But with this, everything is about preparation and running our team."" Do they fight amongst themselves? ""Oh, we fight all the time,"" Walvius said with a laugh. ""We fight about business decisions and the pace of our business. I want to research everything."" Sometimes, she said, when they realize they can't resolve their differences, they just put them aside and move on. Do they see any parallels between male-dominated college and professional sports, and competing in the male-dominated business world? Not really, they say. ""In sports, there are constant reminders that you're not the same,"" Walvius said. She mentioned gender-based differences in ""practice times, modes of transportation, facilities -- you live that every day."" But in the business world, she said, they're ""competing in an arena today where that's not the case. It's truly about the bottom line."" The two say they don't have time anymore to shoot baskets or even talk basketball. It's all business as they prepare for a major retail launch at upscale department stores and sporting goods stores. ""What we're doing is trying to change the face of bedding in the world,"" Marciniak said. ""What we want to do is win a 'national championship' with SHEEX."" Now that they're playing ball with business barons, do Marciniak and Walvius miss their days on the hardwood? ""I miss some of the players who will really go to the wall for you,"" Walvius said. ""I miss the strategy of the game. Every once in a while, I'll see a game on TV and I'll see something that pulls me back there.""","Ex-college, WNBA guard Marciniak, ex-head coach Walvius team up for business .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI arrived in Havana on Tuesday amid speculation over whether he will meet with the island's former president, Fidel Castro, and how far he'll press the country for greater political and religious freedoms. Benedict visited both privately and publicly with President Raul Castro on Tuesday evening. Those meetings, at least one of which was expected to include Castro's family, prompted talk as to whether that also would include the president's older brother, who stepped down from power in 2006 after battling illness. The closely-watched trip is the second part of a two-country tour Benedict has used to spread the Catholic faith and address political issues -- at times subtly and on occasions more overtly. He had traveled to Mexico prior to heading to Cuba, and drew added attention when he said he prayed ""for those deprived of freedom."" Last week, the pontiff said that Cuba's Marxist political system ""no longer corresponds to reality."" A top Cuban government official responded to the pope's comments, saying his country's system is sustainable and that it will not change. ""In Cuba, there will not be political reform,"" said Marino Murillo, vice president of the island's council of ministers. Also arriving on the island over the weekend was Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, reported by Cuban state television to be in Cuba for radiation treatment for cancer. It's also not clear whether Benedict will visit with Chavez, who has frequently traveled to Cuba for medical care and to meet with the country's leaders, but the island was abuzz Tuesday with talk over what kind of behind-the-scenes discussions among the leaders, if any, were being had. On Wednesday, Benedict is scheduled to preside over huge crowds during Mass in the capital's Revolution Plaza, where 14 years ago Pope John Paul II addressed throngs of Cubans in the historic first papal visit to the island. Havana officials have been busy planning for his arrival, painting buildings and tacking posters across the city. The trip is timed to the 400th anniversary of Our Lady of Charity, Cuba's patron saint, but uncertainty looms over what more will be said, with whom the pope will meet and what the visit will actually mean for Cubans. ""For me, I'm very happy he's coming,"" said Juana DeArmas, a shopkeeper in the capital's Old Havana district. ""I was here when John Paul came, and there were always plenty of tourists that followed."" The visit is also seen as a possible tourism boost to the island's cash-strapped economy, as many residents seek to make use of a series of free market reforms that have slowly swelled the number of private businesses in the country. Small privately owned shops have since cropped up along side streets in the Cuban capital, and property, including real estate, can be bought and sold for the first time in decades. Benedict, 84, arrived in Cuba's southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba on Monday, later heading to the city's Basilica del Cobre where he prayed in front of the Virgin of Charity of Cobre, a wooden statue considered to be the shrine of the island's patron saint. Upon his arrival, the pontiff was greeted by Raul Castro and the country's clergy, including Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega. With a red carpet rolled out to meet Benedict's airplane, Castro walked beside the pontiff on Monday to a pair of large wooden chairs where the two stood for a brief photo op. A brass band played Cuba's national anthem and other tunes as they stood together, while artillery rounds were fired nearby in celebration. Benedict told the audience he seeks to emphasize ""the importance of faith,"" highlighting the need for good relations between the church and the Marxist state. ""I carry in my heart the just aspirations and legitimate desires of all Cubans, wherever they may be,"" he said. Castro welcomed Benedict, saying his country has worked for peace and justice, but also took the opportunity to deliver a swipe at the United States. Even ""14 years after John Paul's visit,"" the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba persists, Castro said. Clad all in white, Benedict walked with the Cuban president, who was dressed in a dark suit, and greeted other state officials and clergy. Crowds of flag-waving Cubans lined the street on which Benedict's motorcade traveled, as Cuban state television captured both ground and aerial footage of the trip. Benedict then celebrated Mass in the city's square, drawing huge crowds, as legions of musicians playing wind and string instruments performed during pauses in his sermon, supported by what appeared to be concert-grade sound systems. Cuba says it won't change its political system . In 1998, Fidel Castro greeted a much different pontiff when thousands were introduced to John Paul II, who famously urged the nation ""to open to the world, and the world to open to Cuba."" ""There was a kind of love affair between John Paul and Latin America,"" said CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen. ""It just isn't the same with Pope Benedict."" In Mexico, an archbishop urged worshipers to stop making comparisons between Benedict and his predecessor, who drew massive crowds across Latin America and visited every country in the region before he died in 2005. In Cuba, though John Paul helped to warm church-government relations, the country's ties with religion have remained complicated. Decades earlier, Castro's communist revolution sought to stamp out religious influence in Cuba, confiscating church property and expelling religious workers, some of whom had supported anti-Castro forces. The country was officially atheist until the 1990s when the constitution was amended, and references to atheism were replaced with secularism. Christmas was recognized as a holiday at that time, and Communist Party members were permitted to openly practice their faith, if they had one. Church officials now say the island is about 60% Catholic, though few openly practice. Still, religious access to state television and the administration of religious schools remain largely restricted, which could be a point of emphasis during the pontiff's trip, observers said. ""These papal visits can have an impact,"" Allen said. ""They can kind of jar things loose. And it seems that under Raul, Cuba is taking baby steps toward normalization."" But many on the island seem skeptical that the trip will yield lasting results. While the country's Roman Catholic Church has often been lauded for its role in recent reforms, it has also received heavy criticism for appearing too cozy with the government. Rights groups say the nation has largely emptied its jails of political prisoners, and yet it continues to harass the country's activists.","NEW: Pope Benedict XVI arrives in Havana, meets with President Raul Castro .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The debate over government spending is heating up on the campaign trail and raising greater focus on which presidential candidate will really change the way Washington does business. Sen. John McCain has criticized politicians who request millions in so-called earmarks. But will that sway the American electorate? Sen. John McCain has been a crusader against so-called earmarks and says his opponent, Sen. Barack Obama, has asked for almost $1 billion in pork-barrel projects for his state in just less than four years in the Senate. ""Nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in office! And that's change? My friends, don't be fooled,"" McCain said September 9. Earmarks are requests for money by a specific legislator, usually for her or his constituency, added onto often-unrelated government spending bills. According to the nonpartisan watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in earmarks during his Senate term. But the group gives him credit for disclosing his requests, which most members of Congress don't do. Obama has not made any requests for the next fiscal year, and even when he was asking for earmarks, he was far from the worst offender, the group says. ""Just to put it into perspective, he got $98 million worth of earmarks in fiscal year 2008. Sen. [Hillary] Clinton got more than $300 million in earmarks, and Sen. [Thad] Cochran, Republican of the [Senate] Appropriations Committee, got $800 million in earmarks,"" Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense said. Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, doesn't come close to that. But Biden also has never disclosed what he's asked for, until this year. Biden's office said he's requesting about $300 million. The Obama campaign points out that although McCain hasn't asked for earmarks, his running mate hardly has room to talk.  Watch McCain rail against earmarks Â» . ""When you've been taking all these earmarks when it is convenient and then suddenly you're the champion anti-earmark person, that is not change,"" Obama said Monday. According to state records and Taxpayers for Common Sense, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has asked for about $450 million in federal money since she became governor. But she also gets some credit. ""As governor, she has, by all records, started to reduce the number of earmark requests ... so it's a downward trajectory by our analysis but still significant earmark requests,"" Ellis said. Palin also got into the earmarking game early, before she became governor. According to state records and Taxpayers for Common Sense, she helped get about $27 million, some of which went to the small Alaskan town of Wasilla, during her second term as mayor there, from 1998 to 2002. The watchdog group said one of the reasons was that she hired a lobbying firm run by a former staffer for Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, one of Washington's most legendary earmarkers.","McCain has railed against politicians requesting earmarks .

"Washington (CNN) -- An entire class of statin drugs will get new labels that alert the public to safety concerns, the Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday. Statins, which treat cholesterol, now will come with labels that include a warning that the drugs, taken by almost 32 million Americans, can cause memory loss and confusion. The FDA says reports in general have not been serious, and the symptoms subsided when patients stopped taking the medications. The new labeling will also warn doctors and patients that statins can cause hyperglycemia, an increase in blood sugar levels and increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes. The FDA will no longer recommend routine and periodic monitoring of liver enzymes of patients taking statins. Instead, it said liver enzyme tests should be performed before a patient starts taking statins, and then only when clinically indicated. That's because according to the FDA, serious injury to the liver is rare, and routine monitoring doesn't detect or prevent it. The new label will tell patients who experience fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, upper stomach pain or jaundice to notify their doctor immediately. There also will be a label change specific to lovastatin (Mevacor). Certain medicines interact with this particular statin, increasing the risk of myopathy, or muscle damage. The agency says some drugs should never be taken with Mevacor including protease inhibitors, a class of HIV drugs and certain drugs used to treat bacterial and fungal infections. ""We want healthcare professionals and patients to have the most current information on the risks of statins, but also to assure them that these medications continue to provide an important health benefit of lowering cholesterol,"" said Dr. Mary Parks, in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Statins are used to prevent and treat atherosclerosis, the build up of plaque on the inside of blood vessels causing them to become thick and hard. The result can be heart attacks and stroke. Statins help lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ""bad"" cholesterol. The products that will have these label changes include Lipitor (atorvastatin), Mevacor (lovastatin), Crestor (rosuvastatin) and Zocor (simvastatin). Labels for combination statin products like Advicor, Simcor and Vytorin will also change. In a statement, Pfizer, maker of Lipitor, one of the top-selling prescription drugs in the world told CNN: ""The announcement today by the FDA provides additional information to physicians and patients regarding statins including Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium). The class labeling is based on FDA evaluation of all statin labels, entry of new interacting drugs on the market, and a review of clinical data and post marketing reports. Lipitor has been supported by a wealth of clinical research and real-world experience and has been studied in more than 400 ongoing or completed trials, including more than 80,000 patients and is backed by more than 19 years of clinical experience and more than 200 million patient-years of experience."" Amy Egan, deputy director for safety in the FDA's Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products, says the agency looked at the adverse events reported to determine the scope of the problem. They can't say what caused the memory loss and confusion, but it seems to be a class effect and a rare event. ""When we looked at these reports they ran the gamut -- memory loss, memory impairment, confusion -- and they were occurring anywhere from one day after initiation of the statin to years after initiation."" Egan said. ""We could not identify if it was age specific because it was across a range of age groups. We did not see it occurring as a drug interaction, where patients were also taking other medications that were reacting with the statin to cause the confusional state. But we really want to get the message out there that we do not consider this a major problem, and certainly it does not outweigh the tremendous benefits of statin therapy."" James Howard, director of the Lipid Clinic at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, DC, says the new changes are a real step forward. He says the concern over an increased risk of diabetes is valid but not a reason to shun statins. ""The diabetic has a significant increased risk for heart disease, and the most clearly demonstrated therapy that will affect that is to control their cholesterol and their blood pressure,"" Howard said. ""Statins are very important in diabetics to reduce their risk of heart attack and stroke. So the benefit they will receive in that reduction in risk far outweighs the risk of developing diabetes. It's a small risk, but it's a lot of people.""","Nearly 32 million Americans take statins, a cholesterol drug .

"(CNN) -- Days before Russia hosts the world for the Winter Olympics, authorities have acted to punish those they say violated a ban on ""gay propaganda,"" a prohibition derided by activists and defended by conservatives, who say it protects young people. Those penalized include Lena Klimova, the creator of an online support group for Russia's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender teens, state-run RIA Novosti reported Friday. According to the news agency, the support group features posts from gay teens about dealing with homophobia and trying to gain acceptance in Russia . Activists said Klimova, who set up the Children-404 group on the social networking website Vkontakte, faces a fine of up to 100,000 rubles (about $2,850 U.S.), after an ultraconservative lawmaker urged authorities to look into the site. Vitaly Milonov, who helped lead the push to enact the legislation, told RIA Novosti he made the request believing the group spurs teenagers to question their sexuality. ""Without such groups, no kids like that would exist,"" Milonov said. Passed last summer, the ""gay propaganda"" law makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. It has been widely criticized not only by LGBT advocates but also by Western leaders, who have called it archaic and discriminatory. RIA Novosti called Klimova's case the fifth related to the ""gay propaganda"" law since it has been enacted. Another case reported by the same agency on Thursday ended with the editor-in-chief of Molodoi Dalnevostochnik newspaper, in Russia's far eastern Khabarovsk region, being fined 50,000 rubles. Alexander Suturin was punished for a September article about a geography teacher and gay rights activist who said he was pressured into quitting his job and assaulted by neo-Nazis because of his sexuality, according to a RIA Novosti report. Suturin denied during his trial that this story was propaganda and vowed to appeal. These two incidents come about 10 days after Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he had not ""heard that this law"" -- meaning the ""gay propaganda"" prohibition -- ""was applied in practice."" ""There are many talks, but no application of the law, practical application,"" Medvedev said, adding that much of the criticism has come from outside Russia. ""So, I believe that this has nothing in common with the real situation in our country."" Days earlier, on January 17, Russian President Vladimir Putin defended a law that he said was about protecting children, not about banning homosexuality. Putin: Gays 'can feel safe' at Sochi Winter Olympics . ""We have just recently passed a law prohibiting propaganda, and not of homosexuality, but of homosexuality and child abuse, child sexual abuse. But this has nothing to do with persecuting individuals for their sexual orientation,"" he told reporters. ""So, there is no danger for people of such nontraditional sexual orientation who are planning to come to the games as guests or participants."" The scrutiny over the law comes at a time when Russia is under the spotlight as host of the upcoming Winter Olympics. They start February 7 in the Black Sea city of Sochi.","The founder of an online support group for gay teens is fined, state news reports .

"(CNN) -- President Obama on Tuesday outlined an ambitious agenda that requires ""significant resources,"" even as he aims to halve the deficit by the end of his first term. President Obama says the United States will overcome . its current economic struggles. In his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Obama said it's time to act boldly not just to revive the economy, but ""to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity."" ""While the cost of action will be great, I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater,"" he said. The president struck an optimistic tone, asserting that ""we will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before."" Obama focused on the three priorities of the budget he will present to Congress later this week: energy, health care and education. The president said he sees his budget as a ""vision for America -- as a blueprint for our future,"" but not something that will solve every problem or address every issue.  Watch Obama lay out his plan to ""save our children from debt"" Â» . ""It reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited -- a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession,"" he said. Obama said his administration already has identified $2 trillion in government spending cuts that can be made over the next decade.  See video highlights of the speech, issue by issue Â» . The president touted the $787 billion stimulus plan he signed into law last week, saying it will invest in areas critical to the country's economic recovery. He also made bold promises for what these investments will achieve. Obama predicted that because of the recovery plan, the United States will double its supply of renewable energy in the next three years. He also said the country will invest $15 billion a year to develop technology for green energy.  Grade Obama's speech Â» . Obama also pledged a ""historic commitment"" to health care and said the recovery plan could lead to a cure for cancer. He also promised the ""largest investment ever"" in preventive care. On education, Obama set a goal of having the highest college graduation rate in the world by 2020. He pointed to the billions for education -- from early childhood education expansion to college-loan programs -- in the economic stimulus package to ensure that every child has access to education ""from the day they are born to the day they begin a career."" Obama also said his budget will pay for more soldiers and Marines, increase their pay and expand veterans health care and benefits. iReport.com: Did Obama really deliver? Obama said the recovery plans already in the works are immediate steps to revive the economy in the short-term, ""but the only way to fully restore America's economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world."" ""Slowly, but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will recover,"" he said, asking Congress to join him in ""doing whatever proves necessary because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession."" Obama promised to reform the regulatory system to ""ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again."" The president also signaled that he was willing to take on entitlements, saying that Congress must take on the growing costs of Medicare and Social Security. Obama described the nation's financial woes as a ""reckoning"" for poor decisions made by both government and individuals.  Watch what Obama says about the ""day of reckoning"" Â» . ""A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future,"" Obama said. ""Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day."" Noting that is easy to ""become cynical and doubtful,"" Obama said he has learned that ""hope is found in unlikely places."" Obama avoided lofty rhetoric and instead used examples of specific people to personalize his points. Abess is a bank president from Miami, Florida, who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus and distributed it among people who had worked for him. Bethea is an eighth-grade girl from South Carolina who, in a letter to lawmakers, asked for help for her school and said, ""We are not quitters.""  Watch Obama talk about Bethea saying ""We are not quitters"" Â» . While the economy was the focus of the speech, Obama also touched on foreign policy. The president said he'll soon be laying out specifics on how to win the war in Afghanistan and end the one in Iraq. ""We are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war,"" he said.  Watch the entire speech Â» . Meanwhile, he said, both Afghanistan and its border with Pakistan will remain a key focus. Because Obama's presidency is just a month old, the speech is not technically considered a State of the Union address. The annual State of the Union speech is delivered in the House of Representatives before members of both the House and the Senate as well as the justices of the Supreme Court, the president's Cabinet and international dignitaries.

"(CNN) -- The next train arriving at platform three will be... completely stuck. That was nearly the scenario in France where, it's been revealed, the country's main train company ordered a fleet of new trains that were too big to fit in hundreds of stations. SNCF, whose swift and efficient services are normally a point of pride for the French, spent 15 billion euros ($20.5 billion) on the trains, only to belatedly realize they weren't quite slim enough. The revelation that the new TER trains were too ""paunchy"" for the regional stations they will be serving was made by investigative newspaper Le Canard Enchaine, and widely reported in the French media. The mixup is reported to have occurred when RFF, which operates France's rail network, gave station dimensions to SNCF in advance of the train order. Measurements were taken from more modern stations, but neglected to include older facilities where the gap between platforms is narrower. RFF and SNCF both released statements saying the new trains were part of a network upgrade to cope with a 40% increase in passengers over the next decade. They said 50 million euros were being spent on upgrading 1,300 platforms to accommodate the new trains.","France's rail operators face embarrassment after a mixup led to trains being ordered that can't fit through some stations .

"(CNN) -- A court hearing to determine whether a high-ranking cleric convicted of child endangerment will be placed under house arrest rather than jailed until his sentencing in August was delayed Monday until Tuesday. Monsignor William Lynn was found guilty Friday of one count of child endangerment, the first time a U.S. church leader has been convicted of such a charge. He was found not guilty on a second count of endangerment and on a charge of conspiring to protect a priest accused of abuse. The jury was unable to bring a verdict against Lynn's co-defendant, the Rev. James Brennan, who was charged with the attempted rape of a 14-year-old altar boy and endangering the welfare of a child. Opinion: Teach children to protect their bodies . Lynn was taken into custody after the verdict Friday, when the judge revoked his bail. His lawyer, Jeffrey Lindy, criticized the decision not to let his client remain free on bond prior to sentencing, calling it ""an unspeakable miscarriage of justice (for) a 61-year-old man with no prior record and long-established ties to the community."" He is to be sentenced August 13 and could face up to seven years in prison for his conviction on a third-degree felony. The trial marked the first time U.S. prosecutors have charged not just the priests who allegedly committed abuses but also church leaders for failing to stop them. Lynn is the highest-ranking cleric accused of imperiling children by helping cover up sexual abuse. Calling the verdict ""historic,"" Philadelphia District Attorney R. Seth Williams said the decision sends a message about the potential consequences of not reporting sexual abuse. ""Many people of many generations have unclean hands when it comes to this silence,"" Williams said, adding that others could also be investigated. Church report: Children are safer from abuse . Terence McKiernan, who heads the advocacy website BishopAccountability.org, called the conviction ""a watershed moment in the Catholic abuse crisis."" ""Because of the Lynn verdict, bishops and church officials are now accountable,"" McKiernan said. ""They are no longer immune from judgment and punishment."" And Marci Hamilton, a victims' rights attorney, said the jury's verdict on Friday -- as well as the decision by now-defrocked priest Edward Avery to plead guilty after admitting to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old altar boy -- suggests ""the picture is now clear that the Philadelphia archdiocese permitted crimes against children."" Trial takes a toll on very Catholic Philly . The archdiocese issued its own statement after the verdict, though it mentioned neither the trial nor Lynn or Brennan by name. It did, however, insist that ""the lessons of the last year have made our Church a more vigilant guardian of our people's safety."" Lindy, the attorney for Lynn, said he felt the jury agreed there was no ""far-flung conspiracy,"" though he conceded the prosecution ""scored a victory"" in securing the lone conviction. ""By finding him guilty, they're saying he helped endanger children,"" Lindy said. ""It's the last thing he wanted to do. ... I don't think he's the evil person the district attorney is making him out to be."" Bill Donahue of the Catholic League, an advocacy group devoted to challenging defamation of or discrimination against Catholics, called the verdict a defeat for overzealous prosecutors and victims' advocates, who he said had singled out church leaders unfairly. ""The witch hunt has come to an end, and those who have been clamoring for blood lost big time,"" Donahue said in a statement. ""They wanted the big prize -- they wanted to nail a high-ranking clergyman on conspiracy. ... Looks like their car ran out of gas in Philadelphia."" Archdiocese ousts two priests . More than 60 witnesses and alleged clergy abuse victims testified during Lynn and Brennan's criminal trial, which began March 26 and wrapped up May 31, with jury deliberations beginning the next day. Lynn's defense team argued that their client repeatedly told higher-ups about the alleged abuse and, under strict orders from the late Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, had no authority to remove priests from the ministry. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Blessington characterized Lynn's behavior as ""disgraceful,"" ""shameful"" and ""ridiculous,"" sarcastically calling him a ""hero"" who put young people in harm's way. ""He actually looked you in the eye and said he put victims first. How dare he?"" the prosecutor asked jurors during his more than 2ÃÂ½-hour closing argument. Lynn's conspiracy count related to an allegation that he schemed with Avery and other archdiocese officials to endanger children. Avery had been due to be tried with Brennan and Lynn, but he pleaded guilty in March to a sexual assault that occurred during the 1998-99 school year. The 69-year-old was sentenced to 2ÃÂ½ to five years in prison. Brennan himself was removed from an active ministry role in 2006. Two years later, he admitted that he had allowed the youngster to view pornography and sleep in the same bed with him in 1996, church investigators testified.

"(CNN) -- ""Planet in Peril: Battle Lines"" traveled to a place off the coast of South Africa known as ""shark alley,"" one of the best places in the world to see great white sharks. CNN traveled to ""shark alley"" off the coast of South Africa, one of the best places in the world to see great whites. Shark tourism has become big business, bringing in more than $30 million every year to South Africa. The experience is a major draw for tourists, but it's controversial. Local surfers and swimmers say it is changing shark behavior and may be causing more attacks.   Anderson Cooper swam with these great white sharks -- without a cage -- as part of his report for ""Planet in Peril: Battle Lines."" He talked about the experience Thursday morning with ""American Morning"" anchors John Roberts and Kiran Chetry. Anderson Cooper: We went diving with great white sharks. There is a big controversy over whether or not these cage tour operators are actually changing sharks' behavior. They chum the water to attract the sharks, tourists get in the water, and so we had the opportunity to go cage diving and also to go free diving with the sharks, which is a pretty rare thing. There's not many people on the planet who actually do it, probably for very smart reasons.    You'll see that tonight on ""Planet in Peril."" Actually, swimming with great white sharks without a cage, which is among the most remarkable experiences of my life, I've got to say.  Anderson dives with great whites Â» . Kiran Chetry: What do they call that, a free dive with sharks? Cooper: Yeah, we went free diving with the sharks. The water is chummed with blood, so it's bloody water, and I was just about to get in, and I turned to the guy and said, ""Do you have any recommendations?'"" And he said, ""Project confidence.""  See how great white sharks are lured to the surface Â»  Chetry: There you go. Thanks. John Roberts: He also told you not to breathe, right, because they don't like the noise of the bubbles? Cooper: Right, they don't like air bubbles. Roberts: So, meantime you're down there hyperventilating. Cooper: It's all well and good to say ""OK, don't take a breath,"" but your heart is beating so fast when a huge great white shark is close to you, that you can't hold your breath. So I was actually breathing more and causing more air bubbles. And the sharks open up their mouths and extend their jaws when they're nervous, and that makes me very nervous. Roberts: You're reminded of when Roy Scheider [in the movie ""Jaws""] said, ""We're gonna need a bigger boat.""

"(CNN) -- The NBA and the Los Angeles Clippers' organization may have upstaged Donald Sterling's latest soundtrack Friday afternoon with the announcement that Richard Parsons, former Citigroup and Time Warner chairman, is the new CEO of the team. The public relations contrast was stark: As the National Basketball Association and the Clippers were moving forward, Donald Sterling's statements were coming from surreptitiously (or not so surreptitiously) recorded phone conversations. But now, he has spoken out directly in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. Sterling says in that interview that he was ""baited"" into making his controversial statements. And he makes the argument that he shouldn't be thrown out of the NBA. ""I'm a good member who made a mistake and I'm apologizing and I'm asking for forgiveness,"" he said. ""Am I entitled to one mistake, am I after 35 years? I mean, I love my league, I love my partners. Am I entitled to one mistake? It's a terrible mistake, and I'll never do it again."" Sterling is not the only party suffering from this controversy. The NBA stands at the beginning of what will certainly be a protracted legal and procedural battle, one that will cost untold millions. It also will embroil the NBA in an unwanted controversy for years to come. Having a chief executive of Parsons' stature in control of the team may help the league gain an advantage as a battle over the team's ownership starts to play out, but the NBA's road ahead still will not be easy. But the NBA asked for this. The fact that players and the public largely supported the league will be of little solace to the NBA when it is paying legal fees for years to come. The legal fees may be the cost of doing business, but if banning and fining Sterling would have been adequate, this was an avoidable cost. The NBA's response to the Sterling controversy is a cautionary tale against meting out hasty, summary punishment. Here's why: The NBA likely had the authority to unilaterally fine Sterling as it did. It also appears to have had the authority to ban him from his team for life. If Commissioner Adam Silver had stopped there, Sterling might have been effectively vanquished, because the decisions of the commissioner are shielded from review by a court. For the privilege of joining the National Basketball Association, owners contractually give up certain legal rights and remedies. Fining and banning Sterling was probably well within the jurisdiction of the NBA. But in seeking to ""max out"" Sterling's sentence by forcing him to sell the team, the NBA is forging new legal territory, and doing so at a price. Sure, there are catch-all provisions of the NBA's rules that ostensibly allow for ouster of an owner who brings harm to the league, but the ouster rules on the whole appear designed for dealing with teams and owners suffering economic or management problems, like failing to make payroll -- not for owners who were private bigots. There will be an answer to the ultimate question of whether the NBA can legally oust Sterling. We just don't know what it is yet. The league and Sterling can purchase an answer to that question, at the cost of years of litigation and untold fortunes in legal fees. Moreover, if the NBA's objective was to distance itself from Sterling, they have done the opposite. After years of prolonged public litigation, they will cling to each other as two spent swimmers, choking their own business interests in the process. Early on, Silver made clear that the punitive measures were directed at Sterling, not at other members of his family. With this blessing, estranged wife Shelly Sterling has injected herself as a blame-free alternative owner. But does she have an ownership interest in the team? Determining true ownership of this team will be a Gordian Knot of litigation: First, there is the issue of whether the NBA can oust an owner where actual ""ownership"" is disputed. If the team is held in trust, as reported by the Los Angeles Times, and not by a single owner in Sterling, that changes the contours of ownership. A trust is a legal entity in which property (like a team) is held for the benefit of other persons. It's a protective device, designed for situations just like this: where a beneficiary of a trust is attacked, the property cannot be reached because the beneficiary does not actually ""own"" the property -- even though he may receive payments or otherwise profit from the property. The complexity doesn't end there, though. Even without a trust, in California, spouses acquire interests in family businesses when distributing property in a divorce. But that is only a general rule, and who knows what default rules Donald Sterling has attempted to deal with by contract? One thing is for sure, whether it's the NBA, Shelly, or Donald Sterling, each party will mount a different legal argument concerning ownership based upon their own best interests. Determining the ""owner"" of the Clippers will be a hodgepodge of legal issues worthy of the bar exam: divorce law, corporate dissolution, trusts and estates law. For now, Shelly Sterling is a cause for concern for the NBA, the other owners, and her own husband. She has leverage, possibly even 50% ownership of the team. The NBA owners must be longing for the ""good old days"" when their biggest problems were contract disputes and torn ACLs. We can only guess at the individual owners' respective positions at the moment Silver handed down verdict and sentence against Sterling. Now, the commissioner has placed the onus on the owners: They have the burden of deciding whether to oust one of their own. It is a Hobson's Choice, which is no choice at all: Even if the owners are privately sympathetic to Sterling, an owner who dares to defend the embattled Clippers owner commits social seppuku. On the other hand, NBA owners are independent thinkers and independently wealthy; if anyone can weather criticism, it's these captains of industry. Mark Cuban has already publicly observed that ""people are allowed to be morons."" Whether the owners ultimately cast their ballots for or against Sterling, all of these owners would rather be somewhere else. Public perception aside, the owners have other concerns: If this case goes to litigation, expect broad-reaching discovery demands and subpoenas for sensitive documents and information. This case is a minefield for them, with no real upside. At the moment, there appear to be a few winners in the Sterling controversy. Kia, CarMax, State Farm Insurance and Virgin America are just some of the companies that pulled advertising from the Clippers after the first tapes were revealed. Ironically, they garnered more buzz by not spending money advertising than they would have by actually spending money on advertising. It's the ultimate win-win, and it's not over yet. As long as someone else spends the time and money to excise Donald Sterling from the Clippers, the sponsors will have a second photo op. They will return triumphantly to advertising with the team, and take partial credit for the brave stance against one offensive octogenarian -- a stance that didn't actually require them to do, or spend, anything. Heading into the weekend, the advantage is with Shelly Sterling -- who may have a valid claim to ownership -- the NBA, and Parsons, the highly credentialed, newly anointed CEO. Donald Sterling's next moves will be interesting, though his first moves should be away from the telephone -- at least for now.","NBA named Richard Parsons as new CEO of the LA Clippers .

"(CNN) -- Protesters on Khreshchatyk, the main street of the Ukraine capital Kiev, have warned of ""blood and war"" from their position on a barricade made of snow and wood. Their would-be savior is Vitali Klitschko, a man all too familiar with blood and war during an illustrious boxing career which appears to have finally come to a close with Dr Ironfist announcing his plan to focus solely on politics rather than pugilism. The older of the Klitschko brothers is not used to losing -- he suffered just two defeats in his 47-fight professional career and has been World Boxing Council heavyweight champion since beating Sam Peter in October 2008. But the 42-year-old has a bigger fight ahead of him as an opposition leader to current president Viktor Yanukovych, and is seen as the popular choice to lead his country out of its current mire. Talking about a possible return to the ring, Klitschko, who has been named Champion Emeritus by the WBC, said: ""That is something I currently cannot imagine. My focus is on politics in Ukraine and I feel the people there need me."" The heavyweight is seen as the public's political savior in a country where foreign reserves fell 9% last month to $19 billion, with the treasury in the precarious position of having only sufficient funds to stay afloat for a few weeks. There had been talks of a loan from the International Monetary Fund and closer ties to the European Union but those discussions have since stalled with Yanukovych instead opening talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin over possible much-needed loans. Of that Putin meeting, Klitschko said: ""No one from the media or among Ukraine's citizens knows the true aim of this visit and we will only know afterwards. I'm sure that the visit is wrong and nobody knows the conditions of these negotiations."" Klitschko has entered politics under the befitting Udar (Punch) party banner, a nod to his illustrious sporting career. In a statement, the WBC paid tribute to the boxer following his decision: ""With the current extreme and delicate political situation in Ukraine, Vitali has answered his country's call to fight for human rights and equality. Accordingly, Vitali will not be able to provide the WBC with a predictable timeframe to return to the ring. ""In light of these considerations, the WBC Supreme Council and the WBC Board of Governors have voted unanimously to name Vitali Klitschko WBC Heavyweight Champion Emeritus. ""Very few fights have received such an honorable distinction, which will entitle Vitali to fight for the WBC heavyweight championship when he is ready to return to the ring."" Following the WBC's announcement, Klitschko added: ""I thank the WBC and its president Jose Sulaiman for the support in our battle for democracy and freedom in Ukraine.""","WBC heavyweight champion hints at end of career to fight political battle in Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- A Penn State assistant football coach who reportedly told Joe Paterno in 2002 he witnessed a young boy being sexually assaulted in a shower won't be at Saturday's Nebraska game because of ""multiple threats,"" the university athletics website said Thursday night. A graduate assistant at the time, Mike McQueary told a grand jury he had witnessed former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, now 67, assaulting the boy at the campus football complex. Questions over how university officials responded to reports of alleged abuse cost coaching legend Paterno and university President Graham Spanier their jobs. McQueary has been criticized for not calling police, but he has not faced any legal charges. According to a grand jury report, the graduate assistant entered a locker room on a Friday night in 2002 to stow away some sneakers. ""As the graduate student entered the locker room doors, he was surprised to find the lights and showers on,"" the grand jury report stated. ""He then heard rhythmic, slapping sounds."" The assistant looked into the shower and ""saw a naked boy ... whose age he estimated to be 10 years old, with his hands up against the wall, being subjected to anal intercourse by a naked Sandusky,"" the grand jury report stated. Read the indictment (PDF) (warning: graphic content) The graduate assistant reported the incident to Paterno, who in turn alerted Athletic Director Timothy Curley, Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said earlier this week. Kelly said the alleged failure of Curley and Gary Schultz, the university's senior vice president for finance and business, to report abuse claims to authorities ""likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many, many years."" Instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Curley and Schultz banned Sandusky from having children from the charity he founded, Second Mile, visit the football building, Kelly said. Sandusky's lawyer told CNN Thursday evening his client has already been tried in the court of public opinion. Sandusky, who faces child rape charges, disputes the 23-page grand jury summary of graphic testimony, said attorney Joseph Amendola. Penn State's new interim head coach carried a blunt message of solidarity for the alleged victims of sex abuse, firm confidence in his embattled players and a paean for Paterno. Tom Bradley, the longtime defensive coordinator for the team, faced a roomful of relentless reporters Thursday working to glean more details about a case rocking the sports world. Bradley didn't discuss the investigation, but he said he and his players were thinking about and grieving for the victims of the abuse and their families. ""We all have a responsibility to take care of our children,"" said Bradley, a Johnstown, Pennsylvania, native who played for the Nittany Lions in the 1970s and has been on the team's coaching staff for 33 seasons. The university's board of trustees on Wednesday night fired Paterno, the winningest coach in major college football, and Spanier, effective immediately, a bombshell announcement that punctuated the gravity of the scandal. A beloved national figure for his success on the field and his focus on academics and civics, the 84-year-old Paterno has faced withering criticism over his response to the charges against Sandusky. Paterno reported the allegations to his boss. Pennsylvania's attorney general said it appeared Paterno had met his obligations under state law, but critics have said the coach should have reported the suspected abuse to police. That perceived lapse led to the coach's downfall. State Rep. Kevin Boyle, a Philadelphia Democrat, told CNN's Anderson Cooper he plans to introduce a measure aimed at ensuring that people who witness or learn of the abuse of a child report it to the proper authorities. ""In light of the alleged child sex abuse scandal at Pennsylvania State University, it is clear that a loophole exists in our law,"" Boyle said in an earlier news release. ""My legislation would close that loophole by requiring those who are aware of the abuse to report it to law enforcement authorities, rather than simply following an in-house chain of command."" Boyle told ""AC360"" there was a deliberate ""plot"" by Penn State to cover up the allegations against Sandusky. Bradley wouldn't discuss his relationship with Sandusky, whom he once worked for. But he delivered high praise for Paterno, remarks reflecting the strong love and allegiance people across America have had for the coach. Paterno had a ""dynamic impact"" on many, and Bradley said he was ""proud"" to work for him. He said Paterno has ""meant more to me than anybody except my father."" Backers of the coach affectionately known as ""JoePa"" showed up angry Wednesday night after news of his firing. Hundreds of Penn State students spilled into the streets of State College in what started as an apparent celebration of Paterno, but it turned into a riot. The crowd tipped over a news van and decried the media in anger over Paterno's departure. Penn State's Daily Collegian newspaper reported that ""thousands of students gathered at Old Main at around 10:30 p.m., chanting ""f--- the trustees"" and ""we want Joe."" ""We stand united as students. We don't care what anyone else has to say. We want Joe,"" the Collegian quoted a student named Jimmy Gallagher as saying. The newspaper reported that people hurled rocks and lit a small fire. Police moved in to restore order amid dismantled lightposts, broken windows and the smell of gasoline, according to the Collegian. ""Penn State does not need to be put in a worse light than its leaders already have,"" the Collegian editorialized. ""The spotlight was on Penn State last night and we only drew more negative national attention to the Penn State name. The national media did not come for the students, but they stayed because we put on a show. The emotions brought on by the night varied from somber and respectful to angry and unlawful. This is not what Joe would have wanted."" Gov. Tom Corbett decried the violence. ""The eyes of the nation are on you,"" he reminded residents. ""Please behave and demonstrate your pride in Penn State. Your actions speak much louder than your words."" Bradley, noting the disturbances, said he isn't worried about safety on game day. Nebraska athletic director Tom Osborne said Thursday that while he expects fans of both teams to be respectful, he wants to be sure the environment for the visiting Cornhuskers is secure. ""When you have more than 100,000 people in a stadium, it's probably impossible to conjure up enough officials, security people to absolutely guarantee what's going to happen,"" Osborne told Lincoln, Nebraska, radio station KLIN. ""I just don't know how you do that. We will visit with them today and probably tomorrow and do everything within our power to make sure that there's adequate safety and security provided."" Nebraska's chancellor, Harvey Perlman, also released a statement, and expressed sympathy for the alleged victims in the Sandusky case. ""Looking ahead to Saturday's game, others will pour many issues into this football game,"" Perlman said in a statement. ""Nebraska's participation in no way condones the conduct that has been alleged or makes a statement about the truth or falsity of the allegations."" Speaking to about 15 students gathered outside his house late Wednesday, Paterno said it will take time getting used to his new status after more than 60 years of coaching. ""A tragedy occurred, and we all have to have patience to let the legal process proceed,"" Paterno said in a written statement. ""I appreciate the outpouring of support but want to emphasize that everyone should remain calm and please respect the university, its property and all that we value."" Pennsylvania's U.S. senators, Pat Toomey, a Republican, and Bob Casey, a Democrat, announced that they were rescinding their support for the nomination of Paterno for the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Sandusky, who was arrested Saturday, is accused of sexual offenses, child endangerment and ""corruption of a minor"" involving eight boys, most or all of whom he met through The Second Mile, the charity he founded to help troubled youths, prosecutors said. Sandusky's involvement with The Second Mile provided him with access to ""hundreds of boys, many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations,"" the grand jury said. The former coach is said to have engaged in fondling, oral and anal sex with boys over at least 15 years, according to the investigative grand jury's summary of testimony. Sandusky served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions football team before retiring in 1999. Free on $100,000 bail, he has been accused of sexually abusing boys between 1994 and 2009. CNN's Dana Garrett, Sarah Hoye, Stephanie Gallman, Ed Payne, Samuel Gardner III, Jason Carroll, Jason Kessler, Laura Dolan and Kiran Khalid contributed to this report.","NEW: Assistant coach who reported one incident won't be at Saturday's game .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama has waited too long to address the instability in Afghanistan, putting at risk the efforts to stabilize the troubled country, a pair of authors said Monday. Historian Simon Schama and journalist George Packer told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that U.S. policy toward Afghanistan has drifted as the Obama administration has tried to focus on domestic priorities. The president is scheduled to unveil a new policy toward Afghanistan with a much anticipated speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, on Tuesday night. Many observers expect him to announce he will send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops, on top of the 68,000 already in Afghanistan. ""Obama has to make the case that we need 100,000 American troops in Afghanistan, which is what it will be after this surge, in order to protect our own streets from al Qaeda,"" said George Packer, staff writer for The New Yorker magazine and author of the ""Interesting Times"" blog and several books. ""That is the case he tried to make in March, and he's going to have to make it again, because that is his strategy. It's not going to change very much."" Packer faulted the White House for concentrating on domestic issues, including health care reform and U.S. economic stability, and for the president failing to give a major speech on Afghanistan since March 2009, a silence that allowed public attention to slip. ""It's as if the White House thought, 'One speech and then we can turn our attention to other business, because we don't really want our first year to be about Afghanistan. We don't want the president out there continually, you know, beating the war drums when we've got all these other important issues, which are the issues that got him elected.' ""But Afghanistan didn't care about the White House's communications strategy, and the war went downhill very fast."" Packer said that the United States should look for success rather than victory in Afghanistan, with ""success"" being defined as a relatively stable government in Kabul capable of preventing extremists from taking over or making the country ungovernable. Columbia University professor Simon Schama, author of the multiple-volume ""History of Britain,"" urged Obama to return to the multifaceted role he had achieved as a candidate, willing to address many issues at the same time. ""He can't quite ever decide whether he's Mr. Focus or Mr. Multitask. He was actually elected to be President Multitasking, I think,"" Schama said. ""And there are certain moments in the life of our great republic, actually, when no matter what the health reform is, no matter how much in deep doo-doo the economy is, the nation really is hungry for the utterance of a commander in chief."" Share your views on Obama's Afghanistan decision . Schama called on the president to aspire to be like one of the country's greatest leaders, Abraham Lincoln, who has served as a kind of touchstone for Obama. The Obama presidential campaign actually began on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, in which Lincoln made his ""House Divided"" speech. ""Barack, you've got to be Abraham Lincoln tomorrow night,"" Schama said. ""You've got to tell the story beautifully, truthfully, honestly and bravely. You could do that.""","Barack Obama's U.S. policy on Afghanistan has drifted, writers say .

"PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Trash litters its cities. Electricity is sporadic at best. There is no clean water. Medical and educational services are limited. Basic infrastructure is severely lacking. ""Planet in Peril"" met in a secret location with members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta. These are not conditions that should plague one of the richest oil states in the world. Hundreds of billions of dollars has been made from the Niger Delta's oil reserves and many people have gotten very rich. Conversely, the average Nigerian has suffered as a result of the country's oil prosperity. The United States Agency for International Development says more than 70 percent of the country lives on less than a dollar a day -- the population is among the 20 poorest in the world. Oil companies are only part of the equation. The other is the Nigerian government. Transparency International, a global organization intent on stamping out corruption, has consistently rated Nigeria's government one of the most corrupt in the world. Nigeria's federal government and oil companies split oil profits roughly 60-40. The money is then supposed to make its way down to the local governments to fund various projects. Somehow, little money actually reaches its intended destination. Nigeria's own corruption agency estimates between $300 billion to $400 billion has been stolen or wasted over the last 50 years.  Lisa Ling travels to secret location to meet notorious Nigerian militant group Â» . Gov. Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers state, one of the largest oil producers of Nigeria's 36 states, acknowledges past problems with corruption, but thinks progress is being made. ""There's a lot of improvement,"" Amaechi said. ""The work being done by the corruption agency and the federal government has somehow been able to control the level of corruption in government."" Over the last few years, a culture of militancy and violence has arisen in the absence of jobs and services. Kidnappings for ransom, robberies and even murder happen with regularity. The biggest and most powerful armed group is the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND. They say they are at war against the Nigerian military and the oil companies operating there. MEND, formed in 2005, said it has more than 30 camps throughout Nigeria. Members are armed with high-tech weaponry they said was obtained from ""foreign sources."" Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides and countless oil workers have been kidnapped. Over the years, MEND's attacks on oil pipelines have halted oil production and, therefore, raised the price of oil around the world. They demand oil profits be distributed to average Nigerians of the Niger Delta and said they will not stop their attacks until their objectives have been fulfilled.  See environmental battle lines for ""Planet in Peril"" Â» . The battle is over oil -- one of the world's most valuable resources. But to most Nigerians -- oil is a curse. It has provoked an environmental disaster of monstrous proportions. Since the 1970s, the United Nations estimates there have been more than 6,000 oil spills in the Niger Delta -- that is equal to more than 10 times the amount spilled from the Exxon Valdez in 1989. Yet, there is no international outcry and rarely are the spills reported, even to most Nigerians. They are still happening and the consequences are nothing short of devastating. Communities along the Niger Delta have lived off subsistence fishing and agriculture for decades. Collecting food becomes impossible when a spill happens, like one that occurred in August. The waterways and mangroves are blanketed in thick brown oil sludge that goes on for miles. Toxicity overpowers the air and a sense of lifelessness pervades the landscape. Many say it will take 10-15 years for the area to be free of contamination -- if the cleanup effort commences in a timely manner. The August spill was a result of a leak from an old pipeline that had corroded. It took the oil company three months to clamp the leak, but the company said it wasn't reported for a full month after it began. Once the leak was reported, the company said it was denied access to the site by the community. Leaders of the village deny that, and the finger-pointing between the two sides is nothing new -- there is no love lost here.  Who is telling the truth? Who knows? Either way, the creeks are blackened. This is life in the Niger Delta.","Nigeria is one of world's richest oil states; people are among poorest in world .

Many anxious residents of the nation's capital, Harare, have been sleeping outside banks, waiting for them to open so they can make withdrawals before the institutions run out of cash.  Watch how Zimbabwe's children are suffering Â» . The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had capped maximum daily withdrawals at 500,000 Zimbabwean dollars: about 25 U.S. cents, or about a quarter of Thursday's price of a loaf of bread. Last week, restrictions on cash withdrawals -- due to severe money shortages -- triggered riots. Sixteen soldiers now face possible court-martial due to alleged looting and assaults on civilians and police during the unrest, police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena told The Herald on Saturday. ""We are still investigating the case,"" he said. ""But we expect the soldiers to appear before a court-martial once investigations are completed."" After spending several days waiting in bank lines, soldiers rampaged through downtown Harare, destroying shops and attacking riot police sent to disperse the protesters. Cash shortages are not the only crisis plaguing Zimbabwe. The United Nations has said that more than half of Zimbabwe's population is in dire need of food and clean water.  Watch how a cholera epidemic is affecting Zimbabweans Â» . Acute shortages of essentials such as fuel, electricity, medicines and food are key indicators of a failed economy, according to economic observers. ""The [Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe] is failing to deliver the demands of market, prices are doubling daily, and that demands more cash,"" Zimbabwean economist John Robertson said. ""The huge price increases are resulting from severe shortages of most goods."" The once-prosperous African nation is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis since attaining independence from Great Britain in 1980. Zimbabwe's official rate of inflation is 231 million percent, the world's highest. Critics of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe link hyperinflation to his policies on land distribution and unbudgeted payments to war veterans. Zimbabwe has had no Cabinet since the March presidential election. Its political troubles have aggravated its humanitarian and economic crisis, including a cholera outbreak that has killed close to 600 people since August.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- George Clooney told Esquire in September he had no ""aspirations"" to be married with children. That was a month before he was seen with Amal Alamuddin in October. Could Clooney finally have met his match in Alamuddin, a 36-year-old Oxford-educated British lawyer who reportedly shares the actor's passion for crusading for international human rights? There is plenty of speculation that Alamuddin may be the woman who converts Clooney -- with two Oscars and a firm hold near the top of Hollywood's A-list -- from confirmed bachelor to family man. The latest gossip started Saturday with reports from People magazine and the New York Post's ""Page Six"" column quoting unnamed sources saying the couple are engaged to be married. People source: 'This is real' The Post headline read: ""George Clooney, eternal bachelor, is engaged."" Its source said the couple had ""hoped keep the engagement quiet, but they can't hide the fact that they are very happy."" People quotes a ""source with knowledge of the situation"" saying ""George and Amal are trying to keep things very low-key but they also aren't really trying to hide this, it doesn't seem. I think it's like they want the people they love to know that this is real, that they plan on being together forever."" Alamuddin appeared to be ""showing off"" an engagement ring while dining with Clooney at a Malibu, California, restaurant Thursday night, the Post report said. People reported that Alamuddin ""had a conspicuous ring on her left ring finger."" Clooney's representative Stan Rosenfield responded to CNN's request for confirmation with a very short nondenial Saturday: ""I do not comment on his personal life."" Clooney watchers may be surprised by an engagement, but the clues were out there. Esquire's Alex Bilmes interviewed Clooney sometime in late September, just before ""Gravity"" was released in theaters. The article appeared in the magazine's December issue, which hit newsstands in November. Why isn't he married with kids, Bilmes asked. ""I haven't had aspirations in that way, ever,"" Clooney answered. He was married from 1989 until 1993 to ""No Strings Attached"" actress Talia Balsam. Clooney points to that brief period of matrimony as evidence he ""wasn't very good at it."" ""I was quoted as saying I'll never get married again pretty much right after IÃÂ got divorced and then I've never talked about it since,"" he told Esquire. He said in September that he realized being 52, unmarried and childless might not look good to the public, but that he shouldn't ""rush out and impregnate someone."" But Clooney said he has no ""dislike or distrust"" of being married with children. Alamuddin enters Clooney's life . While it's not confirmed when George met Amal, the two were photographed together in London in October. Clooney made an unusual public denial that he was dating Alamuddin, telling People in late October that the girlfriend reports were ""all made up."" There's good reason to believe the relationship did not start earlier, since Clooney had just split with Stacy Keibler in July. Although Keibler denied it was because she saw no hopes of a marriage to Clooney after two years, the TV host wasted no time finding a husband. She married entrepreneur Jared Pobre in March. If Clooney's relationship with Alamuddin did begin in October, it quickly accelerated. She was his date for a White House screening of his film ""The Monuments Men"" in February. ""They were holding hands,"" according to one of the World War II vets who attended the screening. Harry Ettlinger, 88, called her ""a beautiful lady."" People quoted another unnamed ""observer"" who said the two were ""stuck like glue."" People source: 'She's on his level' There was no doubt remaining about their closeness in March when Clooney took Alamuddin on an African safari. Photographers caught the cuddling couple watching the wildlife in Tanzania and later vacationing in the Seychelles. If Clooney's match is to be a lawyer, he's apparently picked an A-list attorney. A British website ranked ""The 21 Hottest Barristers in London"" last July. Alamuddin was at the top. She ""achieves the seemingly unattainable ideal of contemporary femininity: she is both breathtakingly beautiful and formidably successful,"" the rankers said. A ""source who has worked with Clooney"" was quoted by People earlier this year suggesting why Alamuddin might be different from the long list of Clooney's ex-girlfriends who've lasted for a few months or a year or two since his divorce in 1993. ""She isn't someone who is pursuing a career in acting or entertainment,"" the source said. ""She's on his level."" CNN's Joan Yeam contributed to this report.","Amal Alamuddin, 36, first appeared in Clooney's public life in October .

"(CNN) -- Marjorye Heeney knew something was wrong when she saw a bulging cloud of black dust darken the sky. Drought-like conditions dried this Kern River bed last year near Bakersfield, California. She then heard an eerie, train-like whistle as fierce winds rattled her front door and windows. When she looked outside, hordes of grasshoppers and crows swarmed over her father's barren farm. After the storm broke, her father walked outside and muttered curses as he scanned the horizon for rain clouds. ""I can remember my dad just watching the sky so closely,"" Heeney says. ""A sprinkle would excite him so much."" That's how Heeney, now 83, describes growing up on an Oklahoma farm during the Dust Bowl storms in the 1930s. For much of that decade, ""black blizzards"" -- formed by a prolonged drought and poor farming techniques -- ravaged much of the nation. Now a new generation of Americans is again anxiously looking to the sky. Drought has returned to the United States, and some warn that more tough days are ahead. The value of water is starting to become apparent in America. Over the past three years a drought has affected large swaths of the country, and conflicts over water usage may become commonplace in the future, climatologists say. ""Our focus is oil, but the critical need for water is going to make water the most significant natural resource that we're going to have to worry about in the future,"" says Larry Fillmer, executive director of the Natural Resources Management & Development Institute at Auburn University in Alabama. At least 36 states expect to face water shortages within the next five years, according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, several regions in particular have been hit hard: the Southeast, Southwest and the West. Texas, Georgia and South Carolina have suffered the worst droughts this year, the agency said. Yet most people don't need scientists to tell them there's a water shortage. Plenty of cities have implemented water bans while state squabbles over water usage are common in some regions. What may surprise people, though, are the causes for the recent drought. It's not global warming, some climatologists say. The droughts are caused by rapid population growth and unwise agricultural choices. John R. Christy, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, says the last three years have been drier than usual in many parts of the United States, but overall there's been no shortage of rainfall. He says the U.S. mainland experienced worse droughts in the 12th and 16th centuries. ""The demand for water has gone up,"" Christy says. ""The demand has skyrocketed in places like California and New Mexico because they've tried to grow crops in deserts."" Even drought conditions in the Southeast can't be blamed on a shortage of rainfall, Christy says. The region's water delivery systems can't keep pace with the growth, he says. ""The rain is still falling, but you're out of water because the storage facilities are not big enough,"" Christy says. There's also a public perception that ordinary people are wasting more water, but that's not true, says Mark Svoboda, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center. ""Per capita use of water is down because we're learning to be more efficient,"" Svoboda says. Water shortages don't have to remain a fact of modern life, drought experts say. Many offer the same solutions: Build better water delivery systems to accommodate population growth, develop more efficient uses of irrigation, and shift agriculture from the West to the East where it's easier and cheaper to water crops. Svoboda believes a change in attitude is even more vital than changing habits. ""We take water for granted,"" he says. ""We think it's a cheap commodity that's always going to be there."" Heeney, the Dust Bowl survivor, doesn't appear to need that lesson. She remembers how precious water was in the 1930s when people fetched water in buckets. And when the rains finally ended the Dust Bowl, she vividly remembers her joyous father driving his family out into his fields just to watch the water settle into the soil. Heeney, who now lives in Topeka, Kansas, gets upset when she sees people throw away bottled water or use too much water to wash their cars. ""We don't value water and we're going to regret it,"" Heeney says. ""We forget. We're as dumb as we can be and we don't learn.""","Over the past three years a drought has affected large swaths of the U.S.

"DALLAS, Texas (CNN) -- The FBI has seized a two-page, handwritten letter of condolence sent by Jacqueline Kennedy to the widow of Robert F. Kennedy shortly after he was assassinated in 1968. The family contends the letter was stolen. Jacqueline Kennedy sent her sister-in-law a condolence letter in 1968 which is now in the hands of the FBI. ""We're trying to determine who the legal owner is,"" said Mark White, a spokesman for the FBI. ""There's still an ongoing investigation."" The letter's path from the Virginia home of Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, to a locked evidence vault in the Dallas field office of the FBI is described in a six-page affidavit filed last month in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas by Special Agent John Skillestad. It says Max Kennedy, the son of Ethel and Robert, alerted the bureau in July 2006 to the letter's pending auction at Heritage Galleries and Auctioneers Galleries in Dallas. Max Kennedy, who said he is the sole person in charge of his parents' papers, ""stated that he had not given authority to sell, give, or donate any papers of Ethel or Robert Kennedy to anyone,"" the affidavit says. After the gallery pulled the letter from its auction, the FBI traced its provenance to Thomas Nuckols, who told authorities he had found it among the papers left by his father, Russell Thomas Nuckols, a plumber who died in 1999. ""Thomas Nuckols said he was dumbfounded upon discovery of the letter because he had never seen it before and did not know how it came into his father's possession,"" the affidavit says. Nuckols said he contacted the Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts, but ""the person on the telephone did not seem too interested in the letter"" and referred him to a Connecticut collector, who bought it for $6,000, the affidavit says. CNN has not been able to reach Nuckols. The letter was then resold to several other collectors, and was at one time valued at as much as $30,000 before it wound up with the Dallas auctioneer, who has cooperated with authorities, the FBI said. Last October, the FBI spoke with Ethel Kennedy, who said she remembers Russell Thomas Nuckols as a plumber who worked at the Kennedy house in Virginia during the 1960s and 1970s, the affidavit says. The 81-year-old widow of the former senator and attorney general said she ""never gave the letter to anyone to keep and under no circumstances would anyone have the authority to transfer ownership of the letter to anyone."" The affidavit concludes that the letter ""is considered as a stolen good."" Once the rightful owner is determined, it will be given to that person, FBI spokesman White said. ""I don't know how long it will take."" Jacqueline Kennedy was the widow of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963. In the letter she mentions ""Stas,"" an apparent reference to Stanislas Radziwill, her brother-in-law. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died in 1994. The letter is not dated, but appears to have been written shortly after Robert Kennedy died on June 6, 1968, the victim of an assassin's bullet. The Dallas News printed a copy of the letter, which White confirmed is authentic. It reads: . My Ethel -- . No one in the world could have ever been like you were yesterday -- except maybe Bobby -- We are going home now -- Your phone was busy . You don't want any more callers you must be so tired -- I stayed up till 6:30 last night just thinking -- and praying for you -- and for you in the months ahead -- . I love you so much -- . You know that anything -- Stas will take little Bobby to Africa -- I'll take them around the world + to the moon + back -- anything to help you + them now and always -- . With my deepest deepest love . Jackie .","FBI trying to determine who owns letter written by Jackie Kennedy in 1968 .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said Monday that the war on drugs in Mexico ""is not a failure."" At a press conference in Mexico City after meeting Mexican Interior Minister Alejandro Poire, Napolitano called the drug policies of both Mexico and the United States ""a continuing effort to keep our peoples from becoming addicted to dangerous drugs."" Napolitano also said that among the things discussed at the meeting with Poire was how to have a more regional approach to a number of security issues threatening the United States, Mexico and Central America. Asked why, in spite of efforts by both Mexico and the United States, the leader Mexico's most powerful criminal organization -- the Sinaloa drug cartel -- remains at large, Napolitano implied it's only a matter of time before Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman falls. ""It took us 10 years to find Osama bin Laden and we found him,"" Napolitano said. ""And you know what happened there. I'm not suggesting the same thing would happen with Guzman but I am suggesting that we are persistent when it comes to wrongdoers and those who do harm in both of our countries."" Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, and both Mexican and U.S. authorities are offering multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to his capture. Mexican reporters also asked whether the U.S. Homeland Security secretary still considers Mexico a safe destination. Twenty-two Carnival Cruise Lines passengers were robbed of valuables and their passports Saturday while they were traveling by bus in the middle of a shore excursion near the beach resort of Puerto Vallarta. Napolitano didn't specifically address that incident, but suggested she doesn't believe there is a generalized security problem. ""I think Americans come and go freely to Mexico all the time and I expect that to continue. It's a wonderful country. There are many, many places to go and to see. And obviously we also do a tremendous amount of commerce,"" Napolitano said. The meeting with Poire was Napolitano's first stop of a five-day regional tour that will also take her to Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama. Napoliticano was specifically asked whether the U.S. government is as concerned about the power of criminal organizations in Latin America as it is about terrorism. She called both terrorism and drug trafficking a global scourge, but pointed out there are important distinctions between the two. ""(Drug trafficking) has to be handled in a somewhat different way. It's a different type of crime and it's a different type of plague, but that's also why it is so important that we act not only bi-nationally, but in a regional way, to go after the supply of illegal narcotics,"" Napolitano said.","Homeland security secretary is on a 5-day tour that started in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Russian authorities have released from jail most of the members of a Greenpeace group arrested on their ship in September while protesting oil drilling in the Arctic. Four were let go Friday, bringing to 18 the total number freed so far from the original 30 who were detained, the environmental group said Friday. The so-called Arctic 30, made of 28 Greenpeace activists and two freelance journalists, were detained after two activists left their ship, the Arctic Sunrise, and attempted to scale an oil platform owned by Russian energy company Gazprom. Workers on the Prirazlomnaya oil rig in the Barents Sea thwarted the attempt by fighting the activists with fire hoses. Russian authorities boarded the Arctic Sunrise, drawing guns and smashing communications equipment, Greenpeace has said. After the ship's captain refused to sail into a Russian port, authorities confiscated the vessel and towed it to the nearby city of Murmansk, where the Greenpeace group members were incarcerated. They were transported by prison train to detention centers in St. Petersburg and charged with piracy. The court later dropped the charge, but the 30 still face the charge of hooliganism, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison, according to Russian news agency RIA Novosti. The original charge of piracy carried a sentence of up to 15 years. Greenpeace says the hooliganism charge is still ""wildly disproportionate."" Russian authorities accuse the activists of trying to take over the oil platform and of endangering the lives of the company's employees. They say the activists' actions could have led to an environmental disaster.","Russian authorities arrested the group called Arctic 30 in September .

"Washington (CNN) -- Some Triaminic and Theraflu products are being taken off the market because the child-resistant caps failed to function properly, U.S. officials said on Thursday. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Triaminic Syrups and Theraflu Warming Relief Syrups for cough, colds and fevers were voluntarily recalled by the manufacturer, Novartis Consumer Health, because the cap could still be removed by a child even with the tamper-resistant seal in place. Novartis said the last batch of products in question were distributed more than a year ago, so the company believes little remains for sale or in use. The agency said the products contain acetaminophen and diaphenhydramine, main ingredients in a number of cough, cold and allergy medicines. Acetaminophen is an anti-inflammatory used to treat pain, while diaphenhydramine is an antihistamine used to treat allergies and colds. Under federal law, products containing these drugs must be sealed with child-resistant packaging due to the risk of poisoning. The consumer watchdog said that consumers should stop using the recalled products immediately if they come across any of them and contact Novartis for information about refunds. According to the consumer agency's website, 24 different types of products are included in the recall. A consumer complaint in late November triggered the investigation. All of the products were made in the United States. Julie Masow, a Novartis spokeswoman, told CNN that there are 183 lots included in the recall - 142 of Triaminic Syrups and 41 of Theraflu Warming Relief Syrups. However, since they were distributed between May 24, 2010, and December 21, 2011, approximately 97% of the Theraflu and Triaminic inventory has already been consumed, returned to Novartis, or quarantined at a Novartis warehouse. It is likely that very little product remains on store shelves or in homes, Masow said. So far, Novartis has had 12 reports of children unscrewing the locked caps, including four who ingested the product. One child received medical attention. The Food and Drug Administration is working with the consumer safety commission on the investigation. As a precaution, 17 of the products are also being recalled in Canada. The complete listing can be found at the Novartis website .","Some products being recalled because child caps failed to function properly .

Martos said the flight crew decided to divert the plane and make an unscheduled landing at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

"(CNN) -- This might sound a bit nutty, but U.S. researchers are using robot squirrels to learn more about how real ones interact with their main predator, rattlesnakes. The lifelike robot, built by a team from the University of California, Davis, can replicate two behaviors squirrels display when confronted by a rattlesnake. Research by the late Donald Owings, professor of psychology at UC Davis, observed that rather than scamper off squirrels would approach a snake ""head-first in an elongated posture, making flagging movements with their tails."" He also discovered their tails heat up, which is picked up by a snake's infrared sensor. But in the wild there is no way to separate the ""heat"" and the ""flagging,"" say researchers. And that's where the robot comes in. Out in the field near San Jose, researchers set up ""robosquirrel"" and a video camera near a foraging snake before retreating out of sight. The snakes observed appear to accept the robot as real, with one snake even biting the robot's head, according to researchers. This doesn't happen often in the wild says Clark, because squirrels possess a ""remarkable ability"" to dodge a snake attack. ""Snakes will rarely strike a flagging adult squirrel, and if they do they almost always miss,"" said Rulon Clark, assistant professor of biology at San Diego State University. It's still not clear why squirrels approach such a deadly predator, but Clark says they maybe trying to assess the nature of the threat. In some cases snakes will leave the area after an encounter. ""Robosquirrel"" joins a growing list of robot creatures created by UC Davis which include a robot lizard -- used to study display behavior in anole lizards in the Puerto Rican jungle. Another saw the use of a robot sage grouse hen to study their real-life mating habits.","Researchers in California create robot squirrel to study behavior of rattlesnakes .

"(CNN) -- It's time for Team USA to put up or shut up in Brazil. Beat Germany, or at least eke out a tie, and the Americans go through to the knockout stage. Lose, and they open themselves up to the possibility that their World Cup 2014 run ends in the group stage. That's one of five things we'll be watching for and talking about Thursday: . 1. NOTE FROM THE BOSS . Could be quiet in the office . First came the trash talk between Germany and the United States -- at the United Nations, of all places! Now Team USA's German-born coach Jurgen Klinsmann is trying to rally fans stateside. The game starts at noon ET, right in the middle of the workday, so Klinsmann tweeted a form letter for employees to give their bosses. ""I understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace, but I can assure you that it is for an important cause,"" Klinsmann deadpanned. Between Klinsmann's own account and that of the U.S. men's national team, it was retweeted nearly 40,000 times in the first six hours after the coach tweeted it. 2. WILL FIFA BITE BACK? Clock ticking on Suarez . He bit a guy four years ago and got banned for seven matches. He bit a guy last year and got banned for 10. And now world-class striker Luis Suarez is accused of biting another guy Tuesday during Uruguay's vital match against Italy. He went face-first into Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder late in the match, no question. But were his fangs out? Chiellini yanked his shirt down to show what he says are tooth marks. Suarez responded that it was just a normal collision. Now world soccer's governing body is deciding what happened. If it rules that Suarez did bite Chiellini, it could ban him for up to two years. The decision is due Thursday. UPDATE: Three bites and he's out -- FIFA rules that Suarez did engage in unsportsmanlike conduct and banned him for nine matches and four months, starting immediately. That puts Suarez out of the World Cup, but it's significantly less than the maximum punishment he could have faced. He is barred from all soccer-related activity, even entering a stadium, and has to pay a fine of 100,000 Swiss francs (about $111,000.) Suarez can appeal. 3. WHO GETS THE BOOT? He shoots, he scores . The race is on to be the tournament's top scorer, with the winner getting the Golden Boot. Will it be Lionel Messi, who has given Argentina magical winning shots in their last two games? Or hometown favorite Neymar? They're not the only ones in the race. Germany's Thomas Mueller scored a hat trick in his first match, while Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri did the same in Wednesday night's game against Honduras. And it's not only the tournament's top teams that have great strikers. After Nigeria's Ahmed Musa became the first player from his country to score more than once in a World Cup match, his fans are ready to put him up against the best in the game. And don't forget there's more to the game than scoring goals. Check out this FIFA app for comparing two players and see how your favorite stacks up. 4. SHOW ME DA MONEY . Planeload of cash . Ghana battles Portugal on Thursday for one of the last places in the knockout round, but it's not prepared to do it just for the sake of national pride. Media reports say a planeload with more than $3 million in cash was sent from Ghana to Brazil after the Black Stars apparently complained they hadn't been paid their appearance fees since the start of the competition. The country's president personally intervened to make sure the money came through, according to the country's Football Association. But hours before Thursday's match, Ghana suspended two of its star players, claiming Kevin-Prince Boatang verbally abused the team's coach and that Sulley Muntari physically attacked a member of the country's Football Association. Good news for struggling Portugal? 5. BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS . Middle East unity . Iranians weren't the only ones rallying behind Team Melli at the World Cup. As the underdogs fought for a place in the knockout stage, an Israeli spotted this in a bar in Tel Aviv. Unfortunately, Bosnia and Herzegovina dashed Iran's hopes. Bosnia's 3-1 victory means both teams go home. Journalist James Masters contributed to this report.","NEW: Uruguay striker Luis Suarez banned for nine matches for biting Italian opponent .

"(CNN) -- A poor workman often blames his tools, and every four years the official World Cup football seems to provide the perfect excuse for poor play. As balls go, the ones created for soccer's showpiece tournament have often fallen a bit flat. At the 2002 tournament the Fevernova was deemed too light; four years later the Teamgeist was judged too heavy -- and then came the unloved Jabulani... Compared to a ""beach ball"" by Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas, called ""dreadful"" by England counterpart David James and described as ""very complicated"" by Argentina's star striker Lionel Messi -- who had actually been enlisted to help promote the ball -- the Jabulani left the 2010 tournament with a deflated reputation. So it's over to the Brazuca -- a colloquial term used to describe pride in the Brazilian way of life -- to pump up pride for German manufacturer Adidas, which has been official ball supplier for the world's biggest sporting event since 1970. Like those that have gone before it, the Brazuca is debuting innovative technology, as South America hosts the World Cup for the first time since 1978. It is formed from six identical panels -- two fewer than South Africa's Jabulani -- which are glued together at a certain level of heat and pressure. But the Brazuca has another important design difference which could kick the problems of its predecessors into touch. ""As soon as I got hold of the ball I could see how different it was from the previous two,"" says Dr. Simon Choppin, a research fellow at the Center for Sports Engineering Research at Britain's Sheffield Hallam University. ""Adidas have come up with a design where they've got a deeper and longer seam between the panels than on the Jubulani,"" he told CNN. ""It seems strange to say, but this is an innovation because it's more like the traditional, hand-stitched football where the seam is quite prominent on the ball. ""That seam size and the depth are really important in terms of how the ball behaves aerodynamically."" Choppin said the Jabulani ""misbehaved"" because of the smoothness it gained through its thermal bonding process. ""The player would strike the ball, and in certain regions of the ball the air was chaotic and in others the air was smooth,"" he explains. ""That creates an imbalance in the forces, so the ball tends to get pushed upwards or sideways or downwards. ""With the Brazuca you won't get that patchiness of air, you won't have areas of turbulent or smooth flow, and that will lead to its trajectory being more predictable, more like a normal football. ""It might be better than other balls in how it consistently rolls, and traveling through the air I think it will be more like the footballs that the players are used to in their domestic leagues."" Adidas is taking nothing for granted and has applied a policy of ""practice makes perfect"" to make sure its 2014 World Cup match ball is a success. It is even calling the Brazuca ""the most tested ball Adidas has ever produced"" -- and it has the statistics to prove it. ""It was tested in 10 countries, across three continents by more than 600 players and 30 teams,"" Matthias Mecking, Adidas business unit director of football, explained to CNN. ""The Brazuca was tested by teams including Argentina and Spain, Bayern Munich and Chelsea and current players such as Messi and Casillas. ""It was also tested in Brazil's diverse seasons and climate conditions. We tested it in June and July in various cities to replicate the conditions and temperatures during the tournament. ""The ball was also tested at altitude, at 1300m in Sao Paulo and 1600m in Colorado in the United States. ""It was also tested on dry, slightly damp and very wet pitches, and in windy conditions, gusts and heavy rain."" After such a huge tick list, it is no surprise that the Brazuca has received positive reviews from many of the players who hope to kick and curl it to World Cup glory over the next month. ""The weight is really good, which tells me it's going to be a very reliable and true ball,"" says England midfielder and captain Steven Gerrard, who is sponsored by Adidas. ""The players want to try to be as accurate as they can with the ball, and we get a better chance of doing that if the weight's right because it does what you ask it to do."" Four-time world player of the year Messi said in a similar press release: ""My first impression of the ball is that it's really good."" Even non-Adidas contracted players such as Wayne Rooney, Julio Cesar and Joe Hart have praised the ball in the buildup to the tournament. The first batch of Brazucas were dropped off to all 32 national federations competing in the World Cup in time for Christmas last year. In May, the 4,000 official match balls to be used arrived in Brazil and the training balls were, in turn, handed over to each federation when they arrived at their warmup camps. With such meticulous planning, the players have had plenty of time to get used to the Brazuca, but will armchair football fans be able to tell one ball from another? ""If a piece of sports equipment is doing its job, you won't notice it,"" says Choppin, who has spent much of his career analyzing the behavior of footballs and tennis racquets. ""Previously when these balls wobbled in the air they made the job hard for goalkeepers, so there were more goals, and that's quite good for the person at home watching. ""Adidas has remedied that behavior so I'm predicting the Brazuca is not going to do anything completely crazy or unexpected, so maybe we won't notice as much."" If the Brazuca does have any hidden idiosyncrasies, then the World Cup's most gifted players could still turn them to their advantage. ""When the football at one of the previous World Cups started behaving strangely and wobbling in a certain way Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo learned how to kick the ball in that way repeatedly,"" Choppin explains.. ""So if a piece of equipment starts behaving differently it potentially gives the player an advantage. ""The best players won't complain about it -- they'll exploit it and use it to their advantage. ""Once he had learned to control the ball, Ronaldo saw it was a big advantage and he started scoring lots of free kicks."" But for those without the rare ability to bend the ball like Ronaldo and Messi, could a perfect football be created? ""Maybe as technology progresses, we can do away with seams altogether and start with a blank canvas,"" Choppin predicts. ""Manufacturers will be able to choose ball behavior themselves by adding indented roughness. ""I imagine a future where you can make a football that's marble smooth and then you press in the roughness and seams like adding dimples to a golf ball."" Even if the perfect football was conceived and created, there may never be such a thing as a universal ball -- at least not in today's competitive, commercial market. The raison d'etre for the Teamgeist, the Jubulani and the Brazuca is to showcase Adidas technology and create demand for an exciting new product in front of a global audience. World football's governing body FIFA is expecting 3.2 billion people to watch some portion of the month-long tournament. As long as Adidas, Nike, Mitre, Umbro and other rival companies are competing to sell sports equipment, then a football with universal match appeal will remain as elusive as the gold World Cup trophy itself. As for the Brazuca, no matter how consistently it performs in Brazil, its fate on future football fields has already been decided. After the tournament the match balls rolled out in Brazil will become another Adidas marketing tool used in giveaways, exhibitions and retails. The march of technology and the demand of the dollar means in many ways the Brazuca has already been consigned to history before the World Cup kicks off.","The Brazuca will be in the spotlight as the new World Cup football for the 2014 tournament .

"(CNN)  -- It was one of the most surreal images in American history: A river, so fouled with industrial waste that it caught fire and burned. In June 1969, Cleveland's Cuyahoga River become the poster child for the birth of the modern American environmental movement. Concerns over air and water pollution helped spawn the modern environmental movement in the 1960s. No matter that this was at least the tenth time the Cuyahoga had ignited. The times, they were a-changing, and a burning river confirmed what many already believed: The environment was changing, too. Rachel Carson's book, ""Silent Spring,"" published seven years earlier, had lit the spark. The mild-mannered government scientist documented how the pesticide DDT was jeopardizing countless bird species, from tiny hummingbirds to the national symbol, the bald eagle. Smog from traffic and factories had become a national concern. And six months before the torching of the Cuyahoga, a massive oil spill soiled the shores of Santa Barbara, California. In the midst of the anti-Vietnam war movement, the women's movement, and more, a divided America also found room for an environmental movement. ""We have been acting out the classic cartoon image of a man sitting on the branch of a tree and sawing it off behind him,"" wrote Philip Shabecoff in his 1993 book, ""A Fierce Green Fire: The American Environmental Movement."" Shabecoff described environmentalism as a ""broad social movement"" that was attempting to build a ""desperately needed but difficult and obstacle-strewn road"" out of humankind's increasingly polluted predicament. The movement was sanctioned in April 1970 with a nationwide quasi-holiday, the first ""Earth Day."" New organizations formed to rally the masses: Friends of the Earth (1969), the Natural Resources Defense Council (1970), and Canadian-born Greenpeace (1971). Books touting recycling, vegetarianism, and all aspects of a ""green"" lifestyle hit the best-seller list. An ersatz Indian who called himself Iron Eyes Cody became a national icon thanks to a 30-second TV spot, where he canoes through an industrial wasteland and sheds a tear for Mother Earth. Stanford Professor Paul Ehrlich became a semi-regular ""Tonight Show"" guest. Rachel Carson was one thing, but this was Johnny Carson. The environment had arrived. Even Richard Nixon went green. A President besieged by Vietnam protests saw an opportunity to be the good guy. Nixon founded the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and signed a flurry of landmark environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act -- the vanguard of a new government ethic. The Earth was well on its way to being saved. Or so we thought. Then the movement stalled. Slowed by its own accomplishments, internal squabbles and a growing backlash that government and ""greens"" could be doing more harm than good, the environment waned as a cause. Jimmy Carter's energy-conservation message resonated for a time in the late '70's, but didn't outlast his presidency. Ronald Reagan's anti-regulation message swept the country in 1980, and enforcement of conservation and pollution laws dropped off dramatically. The pendulum swung the other way in the late '80's following a massive industrial accident in Bhopal, India (1984) and a nuclear calamity at Chernobyl (1986). After that, the bad news piled on: We learned about the ozone hole, the first dire reports on global warming, and widespread clearing of the world's rainforests. iReport.com: Share your ideas on little things you can do to save the planet . Smaller, but more telegenic, indignities told the rest of the story: an orphaned garbage barge, on a months-long sojourn in 1988, showed the folly of making too much waste, while some particularly odious waste in the form of sewage and syringes took up residence on the beaches of New Jersey. In the 1988 election, George H.W. Bush seized the issue for the Republicans, promising to serve as ""the environmental President"" and attacking his Democratic rival Mike Dukakis for failing to clean up his hometown Boston Harbor. A few weeks before the elder Bush's inauguration, Time Magazine lauded Earth as its ""Planet of the Year."" By 1990, the Earth had gone Hollywood. ABC ran a two-hour, prime time Earth Day Special whose celebrity-studded cast included Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Robin Williams and many others. Membership in environmental groups boomed, while retailers and manufacturers launched huge ad campaigns touting their newfound green-ness. In 1992, the U.N. held its ""Earth Summit,"" where 108 heads of state met to set goals and declare their good intentions for saving the earth. iReport.com: ""Redneck conservation"" by combining chores . But in Clinton-era America, the environmental movement soon hit political roadblocks. By 1994, Americans had once again had it with Big Government, and Newt Gingrich's ""Contract With America"" swept in a new Congress bent on curbing environmental regulations. A big booster of ""market-based"" environmentalism, the Speaker of the House outraged conservationists by neutering some of their favorite government programs. If environmental concern was blunted in 1994, it was buried in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. Despite a growing body of evidence about vanishing habitats, waning energy resources and global warming, green issues languished in the global focus on fighting terrorism. Also, President George W. Bush was not widely viewed as a friend of the Earth. The son of the ""Environmental President"" led a push to cut budgets, slow enforcement and open up wilderness areas to oil and natural gas exploration. Then, once again, the pendulum swung back. Melting ice caps and back-to-back horrific hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 rekindled widespread concern over global warming -- in spite of the fact that there's no proven link between an individual storm like Katrina and climate change. Several years after exiting the political stage, Al Gore parlayed ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" his global-warming slide show, into an Oscar and half of a Nobel Peace Prize. Journalists re-focused on the issue with ambitious projects such as CNN's ""Planet in Peril."" Which brings us to today. President-elect Barack Obama is promising a stronger focus on renewable energy and environmental stewardship. But Obama also is confronting a global economic crisis, which may limit the time and the resources he can devote to environmental problems. Will financial chaos turn America and the world away from environmental concern yet again? Or will refocusing on our energy and environmental problems restructure the way the world does business? We'll know soon enough. Maybe this time, green will help get us out of the red. CNN.com's Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.","The modern American environmental movement is four decades old .

"(CNN) -- The ""conservagencia"" is starting to give Jon Huntsman a second look. He deserves it. But the stirrings of respect may be too little, too late. Too bad, because he might stand the best chance of beating President Barack Obama. RINO hunting has become a reflexive sport inside the Republican Party. And so when Jon Huntsman entered the presidential race, the impulse was to smack him on style points as a Republican in Name Only. It made some sense on the surface -- after all, he was the former Obama ambassador to China, in addition to being the conservative former governor of Utah. At a time when tea party enthusiasm tended toward the hot, Huntsman was cool, promising a campaign of civility and ideas. He seemed to be courting independents and centrists at the outset of the GOP primary, openly dissing the anti-intellectualism of conservative populist candidates such as Texas Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann. In one infamous tweet, he pined: ""I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy."" All this was very out of step with the partisan tone of the times. And so his actual record as governor and his policy plans as candidate were overlooked. Forget the record of cutting taxes, reforming government, improving the business climate and balancing the budget. Forget that he was the one candidate with real-world foreign policy experience. He was an apostate in a cult-like atmosphere where any dissent is seen as disloyalty. No one was happier than the White House, which was apparently most worried about running against Huntsman (""I think our guys were worried about Huntsman. I think he was the one who people were most worried about"" recounted one Obama aide in Politico writer Mike Allen's and author Evan Thomas' new e-book, ""The Right Fights Back""). So Huntsman had the buzz but no support -- he seemed stuck in the low single digits and even would-be supporters shrugged their shoulders. It seemed to say more about the current makeup of the Republican Party than it did about Jon Huntsman. After all, he was the first candidate to embrace U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's plan for deficit reduction. His jobs plan was touted by The Wall Street Journal in uncommon terms: ""Mr. Huntsman's proposal is as impressive as any to date in the GOP Presidential field, and certainly better than what we've seen from the front-runners."" He even had the guts to proclaim a determination to end the collusion and market distortion of ""Too Big to Fail""-- a cause that could unite Tea Partiers and Occupy protesters. But even though 70% of Republican primary voters say that economic issues are their primary focus, Huntsman's conservative substance could not seem to override the centrist style: He would not pander or throw radioactive red meat. Even the statistical analysis by the fivethirtyeight blog at The New York Times, which found Huntsman would have the best chance of actually beating Obama in the 2012 general election, did not seem to change hearts and minds. But as the revolving door of not-Romneys spun faster and faster, spitting out candidates from Bachmann and Perry to Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich, a desperate search for an electable conservative alternative to Romney commenced. And now, all of a sudden, the Utah governor has started to get some respect. CNN contributor Will Cain was an early advocate of Huntsman's substantive record as a conservative, in contrast to the style he evinced at the start of his campaign. ""In this Republican primary, a candidate's conservativeness seems to be measured by his venom toward Barack Obama,"" Cain wrote in The Blaze. ""And I'm afraid we've elevated style to such a degree that it's clouding our view of what is conservative."" RedState.org editor and CNN contributor Erik Erickson is another unexpected voice lately arguing that Huntsman might just be the real conservative in the race: ""His record as a governor is more conservative than Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney combined. He is more pro-life than either of them. He is more economically wedded to the free market than either of them. He has better foreign policy experience than either of them. Huntsman should be a conservative hero in this race."" Conservative wise man George Will even seems to be making the case in comments delivered on the ""Laura Ingraham Show,"" saying: ""I think if you look at Jon Huntsman's record, what he's laid out, his proposals for taxes and the economy, his opposition to No Child Left Behind, you could make a case that he deserves a searching second look from conservatives. Huntsman's position on foreign policy is the most conservative. That is, it is the most modest in assessing the need and ability of the United States to control distant events."" Jon Huntsman is putting all his chips on New Hampshire, where he's been inching forward in the polls. Unlike the Iowa caucus, it's a state with an open primary where independents can vote and a principled center-right perspective might be rewarded. Tonight he will get a chance to shine in a Lincoln-Douglas style debate with Gingrich in New Hampshire. It might prove to be a highlight of the 2012 campaign -- a substantive and civil debate about ideas, providing more light than heat. As conservatives consider the choice between the two flawed front-runners, Gingrich and Romney, they might reconsider the wisdom of purging center-right candidates like Jon Huntsman on matters of style versus substance. In the process, they just might finally find the perfect marriage of ideology and electability for which they have been looking. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon says some conservatives are starting to give Jon Huntsman another look .
He says Huntsman a modern anomaly: a cool conservative with campaign of civility, ideas .
He says White House worries about him; as GOP candidates fall, his prospects are rising .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)   -- Air traffic controllers were forced to use their personal cell phones to reroute hundreds of flights Tuesday after the Federal Aviation Administration's Memphis Center lost radar and telephone service for more than two hours, snarling air traffic in the middle of the nation. The FAA's Memphis Center lost communication service Tuesday, affecting FedEx flights and others. A spokesman for FedEx, which has its hub in Memphis, Tennessee, said the package delivery company had diverted 11 aircraft to other cities. But most of its flights take off and land after 10 p.m., so FedEx expected the impact to be minimal, the spokesman said. Air traffic was halted at 12:35 p.m. ET when a major communication line that feeds all the telephones at the FAA's Memphis Center failed, said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. Service was restored at 3 p.m. The malfunction, which occurred inside a telephone company's switching office, made it impossible for air controllers at FAA's Memphis Center to communicate normally with adjoining centers to hand off control of flights, Bergen said. In addition, three of nine long-range radar systems were lost, causing the FAA to temporarily ground traffic within a 250-mile radius of the center, affecting flights in seven states, Bergen said. Adjacent centers in Atlanta, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Kansas City, Missouri; and Fort Worth, Texas; were pitching in to try to reroute planes, she said. There was no indication the failure was deliberate, she said. Doug Church, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, called the failure ""a major safety problem."" At the time of the outage, controllers ""were thrust into an immensely chaotic situation in which they had to use personal cell phones to talk to other air traffic control facilities about specific flights that they could not communicate with themselves,"" he said. ""Significant delays"" resulted at airports in the middle of the country, including Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, he said. Memphis Center's airspace includes 100,000 square miles of airspace, covering Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and parts of Alabama and Kentucky. Church predicted that flight operations in the affected area ""are not going to be 'normal' for quite some time."" A spokesman for Northwest Airlines said the impact on the airline was ""pretty minor,"" with 13 flights canceled and 19 others diverted out of 740 scheduled flights for the day. A spokeswoman for Delta Air Lines said it canceled six flights and rerouted several others as a result of the incident.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Narendra Modi took the oath of office Monday to become the 15th prime minister of India. The swearing-in took place in a tightly guarded ceremony at the Colonial-era presidential mansion in New Delhi. For the first time, leaders of an entire South Asian region attended, including Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of India's traditional archrival, Pakistan. But it's not just the guest list that makes this inauguration historic. Never in the past three decades has a political party taken up the reins of the world's largest democracy with an absolute majority. And never before has a provincial chief with no federal experience become head of a national government. Unprecedented invitation . In attendance on the sprawling forecourt of the sandstone palace were the premiers of Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Mauritius; the presidents of Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives; and the speaker of Bangladesh, officials say. ""A promising gesture,"" read the headline of an editorial in the Indian Express on Friday about India's unprecedented invitation to the leaders of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation bloc. Until his election to Parliament this month, Modi, a chief minister of the prosperous northwestern state of Gujarat, has been seen as hawkish by some political watchers, especially over relations with nuclear archrival Pakistan. His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has often accused the administration of outgoing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of being soft on its western neighbor, which New Delhi blames for a number of terror attacks in India, including the deadly 2008 assault in Mumbai. Both countries have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim as their own in its entirety. An editorial in the Indian Express said Modi's ""terrific"" move to invite regional leaders ""should help generate a more realistic appreciation of India's foreign-policy trajectory in the coming years."" ""What matters in the end, however, is the prospect of a more self-assured government in Delhi that is ready to engage the neighbors without standing on protocol and precedent,"" it added. Economic hope . Credited for his pro-business approach as the chief of Gujarat, India's new leader has also raised expectations that his government will succeed in turning around India's slowing economy, generate more jobs and rein in soaring prices and deeply entrenched corruption, issues that are widely believed to have brought about the fall of Singh's government. Modi's party won 282 seats of the 543-seat lower house of Parliament on its own, the first independent win by any single political party in three decades. India has since been ruled by coalitions of national and regional groupings with varied political and economic philosophies. ""The BJP's single-handed majority in the new parliament ensures at least one thing: no more excuses of fractured coalition politics compromising policies and reforms,"" said Jahangir Aziz, J.P. Morgan's chief Asia economist, in a column in the Indian Express. ""More growth, more employment, more infrastructure, lower inflation is just motherhood and apple pie. Identifying and articulating the binding constraints holding these back is the heart of the problem,"" he wrote. Political analysts also describe the debacle of Singh's Congress Party government as a vote against crushing prices. ""Moderation in prices of essential commodities is a potential challenge for Modi's government in a market-driven economy,"" political commentator K.G. Suresh said. ""The honeymoon period will not last longer if measures are not taken in the next 100 days to bring costs down,"" he added. Modi's Cabinet, observers say, will signify his government's model and course. ""It has to be a dream team that balances demands and side effects of growth with promises of low prices to millions of poverty-stricken Indians. It has to be a smart mix of youth and experience with a cohesive approach. With pressures of coalition politics no longer there, the last thing India would expect the new prime minister's core team to be is a chariot pulled by horses running in different directions,"" Suresh said.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Italian authorities are investigating the Vatican Bank over possible violations of money laundering regulations, the Bank of Italy told CNN Tuesday. Another Italian bank alerted Bank of Italy investigators to two Vatican Bank transactions that did not appear to comply with anti-money laundering requirements, the Bank of Italy said. When Bank of Italy investigators told legal authorities about the transactions, they were told that judicial authorities were already investigating the Vatican Bank, a source close to the investigation said. The Vatican said Tuesday that it is ""perplexed and baffled"" by the public prosecutor's actions and that the Holy See aims for ""complete transparency"" in its financial operations. The Vatican said it has ""full trust"" in Ettore Tedeschi, the head of the bank, which is officially known as the Istituto per le Opere di Religione. The Vatican Bank is ""the most secret bank in the world,"" money laundering expert Jeffrey Robinson said Tuesday. There is no way to find out how much money it controls, he said. The Vatican's sources of income include its vast real estate holdings, explained Robinson, author of ""The Laundrymen."" ""They are huge, huge landholders,"" he said. The Bank of Italy investigation was prompted by two wire transfers that the Vatican Bank asked Credito Artigiano to carry out, the Bank of Italy said. The Vatican Bank did not provide enough information about the transfers -- one for 20 million euros (about $26 million) and one for 3 million euros (about $4 million) -- to comply with the law, prompting the Bank of Italy to suspend them automatically, it said. Italian media reported that prosecutors had seized the $30 million. Prosecutors did not respond to requests for comment. It is not entirely clear how much legal authority Italian officials have over the Vatican Bank, since the Vatican is technically a sovereign state. An effort by Holocaust survivors to sue the Vatican Bank in the United States failed in 2009 when a U.S. court ruled that the Vatican Bank had ""sovereign immunity"" and was not subject to lawsuits filed in the United States. A lawsuit against related entities is still in court. The Vatican Bank was created by an order of the pope ""to carry on activities that are for pious causes,"" according to expert testimony related to the Holocaust suit. It accepts deposits only from top Catholic Church officials and entities, Settimio Caridi testified in U.S. District Court in 2006. It uses its funds ""for designated pious purposes"" and is ""an autonomous pious foundation,"" he said. Caridi, a top Italian legal scholar, said the bank was an integral part of the Vatican, calling it a ""central entity under the oversight of the Holy See."" It is ultimately overseen by a commission of five cardinals -- the top position in the Vatican hierarchy below the pope -- which is headed by the Vatican secretary of state. The Vatican Bank is subject to particularly stringent anti-money laundering regulations because Italian law does not consider it to be operating within the European Union. It must supply more detailed information about transactions than European Union banks have to give. CNN's Hada Messia in Rome, Italy, and Richard Allen Greene in London, England, contributed to this report.","The Vatican Bank is ""the most secret bank in the world,"" a money-laundering expert says .

"(CNN) -- Framed by the equator and Tropic of Cancer, the Philippines is one sunshiney place. Some locals cope with the heat by hitting the sugary beaches. Others turn air-conditioned malls into their second living room. Then there are those who seek refuge in the upland barangays (villages), such as Bucari in Leon or Mantalongon in Dalaguete, where the elevation offsets the Philippines' equatorial warmth. In its provincial boondocks, the Philippines has the ultimate paradox: the cool tropical town. Lower temps, however, aren't the only things that make these towns cool. 1. Baguio . Inspired by the British Raj, American colonists built a sanatorium in the chilly heights of Benguet Province in 1903 for heat-oppressed, homesick soldiers. By 1909, the place was transformed into an American town, Baguio, with the help of Flatiron Building architect Daniel Burnham. For a few summers, the American governor-general would move the seat of government here from humid Manila. At 5,200 feet above sea level, Baguio enjoys low temperatures -- in 1961 it dropped to a recorded low of 43 F (6.3 C). Even though the governors-general are long gone, the city remains a summer capital and vacation favorite, packed to the precipice, especially during Holy Week. Tourists eat peanut brittle and strawberries fresh from the nearby fields of La Trinidad. Getting there: From Manila, an eight-hour bus ride is the standard way to reach Baguio (flights are rare, save for the odd charter). Buses leave from Manila's Caloocan, Cubao and Pasay residential areas. 2. Tagaytay . Tagaytay is to Manila what the Hamptons are to New York City. Just more than an hour from Manila, this city hosts second homes of the capital's well off, who are drawn to the lower temps and authoritative views of Taal Volcano, the smallest active volcano in the world. Imelda Marcos once invited Ronald and Nancy Reagan here to check out her ""palace in the sky,"" a mansion roosting 2,300 feet above sea level. Today, moneyed locals live out only slightly less Imelda-like retirements in the city's Swiss-style log homes. Getting there: Tagaytay-bound buses travel along Manila's Taft Avenue near the MRT station or from the corner of Gil Puyat Avenue. If driving, follow the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) toward Tagaytay via the Santa Rosa or Carmona exits. Or get on Mabini Superhighway after SLEX, exit to Tanauan and follow the Talisay-Tagaytay route. 3. Sagada . Episcopal missionaries resided in Sagada in the 1900s, where they were pleased to discover the climate was cool enough to grow lemons. The locals still grow the lemons in their yards. Jutting 5,300 feet above sea level, the so-called Philippine Shangri-La offers an ideal climate to grow a variety of fruit. After dark, the town can turn wintry, reaching the low 50s F (10s C) in January and February. Kape alamid (civet poop coffee), one of many local delicacies, is one way to warm up. Travelers can see just how cool it gets by hopping into the teeth-chattering waters of Sumaguing Cave or climbing to the top of Kiltepan, a vantage point offering views over an ocean of clouds. Getting there: Regular buses and jeepneys depart Baguio's Dangwa terminal for Sagada, a five-hour ride. 4. Don Salvador Benedicto . ""Little Baguio"" is used to describe pretty much any place in the Philippines with any coniferous vegetation whatsoever. But the moniker fits Don Salvador Benedicto (DSB), a town 2,500 feet above sea level on Negros Island. From the 60 F chill (16 C) to the pine-lined thoroughfares and random lion monuments, DSB is a micro-Baguio, sans crowds. Fun experience for motorists: at Magnetic Hill along KM34 on SB13, the road's subtle incline creates the illusion of an invisible force tugging vehicles. Getting there: From Bacolod, DSB is an hour trip by bus or van; it's a half-hour flight or a day's ferry ride from Manila. 5. Canlaon City . Canlaon City rivals Don Salvador Benedicto as Negros Island's summer capital. At 2,600 feet above sea level at the foot of Canlaon Volcano, the city experiences a cool micro-climate warmed up by hot springs that dot the terrain. Numerous waterfalls, including some that have carved natural slides down the mountains, are a great way to experience the city's refreshing feel. It's colder on the Saddle in the Sky, the ridge dividing the volcano's two craters. Midsummer nights are dreamlike at the gargantuan balete tree, located in the city's Japanese-run agricultural estates. The famous tree, believed to be more than 1,300 years old, draws innumerable fireflies nightly. Getting there: Scenic land routes lead to Canlaon City from Bacolod, Dumaguete and San Carlos. 6. Davao City . Encompassing 244,000 hectares, Davao City on the island of Mindanao takes in towering mountains and dramatic green landscapes, as opposed to the heaven-scraping high-rises and concrete jungles that dominate other large Philippine cities. The durian capital of the Philippines, it's one of three cities that share Mount Apo, the highest peak in the country. You can walk a tough trail all the way to the top of Apo (9,692 feet/2,954 meters), but the hot and the restless can make faster, less grueling ascents in districts like Toril, Marilog and Calinan, whose mountain resorts offer untainted air, pine-canopied trails and invigorating falls. Getting there: There are direct flights to Davao City from Manila, as well as from regional points like Singapore. 7. Lantapan . Splayed on a high plateau, Bukidnon province is full of cool locales, such as the provincial capital Malaybalay (another ""Little Baguio"") and Dahilayan, a foggy barangay turned zipline resort. The coldest of the cold is Lantapan, a breakaway district of Malaybalay on the slopes of the Kitanglad mountain range. Lantapan is so cold that dew sometimes lingers as late as noon. Spared by typhoons and seated on fertile earth at 4,000 feet above sea level, the cool climate has made Lantapan one of the Philippines' prolific vegetable baskets. Mountaineers know Lantapan as the gateway to Dulang-Dulang, the country's second-highest point after Mount Apo. Getting there: Buses ply the scenic highway between Cagayan de Oro and Malaybalay every day. Jeepneys bound for Lantapan are stationed at the Malaybalay public market. Manila-Cagayan de Oro flights run daily. 8. Marawi . In a predominantly Catholic, tropical country, Marawi is an oddity, as much for its largely Muslim populace as its climate. Mosques and torogans (royal houses) dot the city. On the island of Mindanao, the city's 2,600-foot-high elevation ensures temperatures regularly plummet to at least 57 F (14 C). Marawi's reputation as a dangerous town has stunted its tourism potential. The local university is a ""zone of peace"" -- at 1,000 hectares it's virtually a city within a city, complete with a hotel. Getting there: Head to Iligan by bus or jeepney from Cagayan de Oro. Marawi is a jeepney ride away, along the Amai Pakpak Avenue from Iligan. 9. Banaue . Banaue is one of four towns in Ifugao province that make up the UNESCO-listed Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras. While these stunning monuments of ancient engineering are widespread in Asia, those in Ifugao trump most in terms of altitude and steepness. The highest ones tower around 4,900 feet above sea level. The variety of rice grown here adapts to freezing temperatures. Getting there: Overnight buses depart Manila for Banaue nightly. 10. Lake Sebu . With its flotilla of lilies and schools of tilapia fish, Lake Sebu on the island of Mindanao is full of postcard-caliber beauty. Even better, the namesake town feels good on the skin, with temperatures seldom warmer than 77 F (25 C). Sebu and two other lakes in the town empty down into seven waterfalls, two of which are connected by a high zipline. Tourists can also settle for canoe rides with the T'boli, a tribe of weavers. Weather-induced shivers are eased by their warm hospitality, if not the traditional cloth (t'nalak) that's sold around town. Getting there: Fly or sail to General Santos City, then take a bus to Koronadal. Ride another bus to Surallah, where vans and jeepneys shuttle you to Lake Sebu. 11. Itbayat . Itbayat is the only low-altitude town on this list. But what it lacks in altitude it makes up for in latitude. As the northernmost town in the Philippines, and thus the furthest from the equator, Itbayat experiences four seasons instead of two. It can out-winter Baguio between November and February, when temperatures crash to 44 F (7 C). Itbayat looks more like an English moor than a tropical island town. (English seafarers settled the area in the 17th century and called it Orange Isle.) Ivatans, the native inhabitants of this frontier town, brave the cold winds with thermal garments called vakul and kanayi. Their houses are built with sturdy walls of coral bound by lime. Getting there: Flights from Manila and Tuguegarao serve Basco, Itbayat's neighboring island, at least once a week. A four-hour boat ride or 10-minute flight links Itbayat and Basco.

"(CNN) -- Chinese pair Yuan Cao and Yanquan Zhang claimed gold in Monday's men's synchronized ten meter diving final. The reigning world champions scored 99.36 with a near faultless final dive to claim the Olympic title. The silver medal went to Mexican pair Ivan Garcia-Navarro and German Sanchez-Sanchez, who pushed the American team of David Boudia and Nicholas McCrory into the bronze medal position with a strong final set of dives. ""We're very happy. Coming from China, of course, we hope we can win more medals,"" said Cao. ""If we are strong at diving it comes from good coaching, diving every day and hard work. Nothing more."" Tom Daley, icon of the British team, and his partner Pete Waterfield led after two rounds, but blew their chances of a medal with a poor dive in round four. British Prime Minister David Cameron made his first trip to the aquatics center to see Daley and Waterfield in action, but he couldn't spur the pair to a podium finish. Cao, 17, and Zhang, 18, had been favorites to take gold in London after a dominating display in February's world championships, also held at the Olympic aquatic center. China now have two diving golds after Wu Minxia and He Zi won the women's synchronized three meter springboard diving on Sunday. ""We had the highest score we have ever got after the first three, but at this level of competition, you can't afford to miss a single dive,"" Daley said afterwards. The 18 year old diver refused to blame a mistake from Waterfield, 31, in the fourth round for their failure to win a medal, declaring that ""you win as a team and you lose as a team.""","Favorites Yuan Gao and Yanquan Zhang pick up China's second diving gold .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's time this debate was settled once and for all. Football or soccer? What do you think the round-ball game should be called? While it may be a basic discussion; arguing whether the beautiful game should be called ""football"" or ""soccer"" is one of the most fundamental debates of the code. On the face it, the answer should be simple. The world body -- FIFA -- has the word ""football"" in its title. End of story? Not quite. The term soccer was coined as slang for ""association,"" in England in the 1880s. The Oxford University Association Football Club's Web site explains that former England captain Charles Wreford-Brown is commonly credited with its origin. Soccer would have been used to differentiate between University sports rugby football (""rugger"") and ""association"" football. Therefore, contrary to popular belief, the word soccer is a British term, not an American one. Soccer is more commonly used in countries that play other forms of football, i.e. Americans also play gridiron football and Australians who play ""Aussie Rules"" football -- a completely different sport entirely. Soccer was initially referred to as football in the United States. In 1913 the United States of America Football Association was formed. In later years, it became the United States Soccer Football Association and today is known as the United States Soccer Federation. Meanwhile they now have the Football Federation of Australia, it's hard to imagine a change to the national side's ""Socceroos"" nickname anytime soon. The ""Footyroos"" doesn't quite have the same sound to it. Now, you may be sitting back in Britain reading this and wondering why there should be any debate at all about the name of football? If you are thinking that, just remember one of the most popular shows in Britain is called ""Soccer Saturday"", so it's not as clear cut as you may think! Even the sport's governing body seems to be open to both options. At next year's FIFA World Cup in South Africa, the area where fans will gather during the tournament is to be called ""Soccer City"". Maybe the word ""football"" just doesn't work? We'd like you to tell us whether the game should be called football or soccer and why. Let us know in the SoundOff box below. You can also vote in the quick vote on the Football Fanzone homepage. Or, if you really want to make your case -- why not post us a video or photos at the Football Fanzone page on iReport.com.

"(CNN) -- The celebrations of Paris Saint-Germain's first French title in 19 years have only just finished but the Qatari-owned club already face a fight to keep hold of one of the their most valuable assets -- manager Carlo Ancelotti. On Sunday, Ancelotti confirmed at the French Ligue 1's end of season awards, where he was named coach of the year, that he has asked to leave the Parc des Princes. Ancelotti is rumored to be a key figure in a game of managerial musical chairs which could see the Italian move to Real Madrid to replace Jose Mourinho, who is reportedly on the brink of a return to former club Chelsea. ""I have asked the club to leave and I am waiting for their answer because I am under contract,"" confirmed Ancelotti, who also guided PSG to the quarterfinals of the European Champions League. Ancelotti could become the second high-profile exit from PSG in quick succession following the announcement of David Beckham's retirement last week. While the Italian coach might be keen to leave, PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifa presents a major stumbling block to Ancelotti fulfilling that ambition. ""I think he signed a pre-contract with Real Madrid, but I can't imagine Real Madrid will make him sign an agreement or there will be a problem in law,"" he told Al-Jazeera. ""There will be no arm-wrestling. We just respect principles, contracts and what we said we would do. ""You have methods, situations in law and negotiations in order to make everything well."" A bullish Al-Khelifa sees no reason why Ancelotti will not see out the remaining year of his contract. ""Yes, we had discussions, he asked to depart for Real Madrid,"" Khelaifi told beinsport.fr. ""I said it is not possible because he has a contract for one year more, so that is our decision. ""It is his problem, it is not our problem. We have offered him another year more on his contract as well as the one he has. When you have a contract, everyone is normally obliged to honor that."" Mourinho is under pressure at Real following a trophyless season which has seen the Portuguese coach criticize a number of the club's established stars. A 2-1 defeat to Atletico Madrid in last Friday's Copa del Rey final, Real's first loss to their neighbors in 14 years, is thought to have been the last straw, with newspaper El Mundo reporting Mourinho will be sacked - possibly during this week. Real are certain to finish second in the Spanish First Division and sit 13 points behind champions Barcelona with just fixtures against Real Sociedad and Osasuna remaining. Mourinho is favorite to fill the current vacancy at Chelsea, where he won two English Premier League titles and one FA Cup between 2004 and 2007. Spain's Rafael Benitez acted as interim Chelsea manager from November, leading the club to Europa League triumph and a third-place finish the league. But Mourinho's name has been sung heartily by Chelsea fans at every recent match, with the Stamford Bridge faithful eager for the return of the coach known as ""The Special One.""","Paris Saint-Germain coach Carlo Ancelotti wishes to leave the French club .

"(CNN) -- Rick Santorum's contention that in order for Puerto Rico to become a state English must be its principal language drew criticism Thursday from the U.S. territory's sole representative in Congress. ""Santorum's view is narrow and a limiting view of what America is all about,"" said Pedro Pierluisi, a Democrat, on CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""English is the predominant language in the U.S. and will continue to be so, whether Puerto Rico becomes a state or not."" Puerto Rico will vote in November on a referendum regarding possible statehood. While campaigning Wednesday ahead of the island's primary on Sunday, Santorum told a newspaper that for Puerto Rico to become ""a state of the United States, English must be the principal language."" There is currently no law declaring an official language of the United States, though several attempts have been made to give English that designation. Thirty-one states have passed laws mandating English as their official language. The Constitution also makes no mention of a language test for territories or properties that wish to become states. Both English and Spanish are official languages of Puerto Rico, though Spanish is by far the dominant language on the island. Santorum was spending a second day in Puerto Rico on Thursday, courting voters ahead of the primary. Asked about his comments on Thursday, Santorum told CNN, ""English has to be learned as a language. It has to be a country where English is widely spoken and used. Yes."" Asked if it should be a requirement for the territory to become a state, Santorum said, ""I think English and Spanish. Obviously Spanish will be spoken here on the island. But this needs to be a bilingual country, not just a Spanish-speaking country. Right now it is overwhelmingly Spanish-speaking but it needs to have, in order for it to integrate into American society, English has to be a language that is spoken here also and spoken universally."" Mitt Romney is expected to win Puerto Rico's primary. He is scheduled to campaign on the island starting Friday. Republican Gov. Luis Fortuno endorsed Romney in January. Romney's campaign issued a statement on Thursday contrasting his position on the issue with Santorum's. ""Puerto Rico currently recognizes both English and Spanish as the official languages of the commonwealth,"" said Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul. ""Governor Romney believes that English is the language of opportunity and supports efforts to expand English proficiency in Puerto Rico and across America. However, he would not, as a prerequisite for statehood, require that the people of Puerto Rico cease using Spanish."" The primary in Puerto Rico comes two days before a showdown in Illinois, where polls show a tight race between Romney and Santorum. One of Santorum's delegates withdrew his support for the former Pennsylvania senator over the language matter, according to a local report. The Vocero newspaper reported that Hector Perez said he is no longer committed to Santorum. The party chair told the paper that one of the alternate delegates submitted by Santorum's campaign would fill the spot. Santorum's campaign was re-energized after key primary victories in the South that raised questions about conservative rival Newt Gingrich's viability as a candidate and portended a long battle with frontrunner Romney. Romney, rejected again by Southern conservatives in the Tuesday primaries in Mississippi and Alabama, won caucuses in Hawaii and American Samoa to claim about a third of the total delegates available and maintain his delegate lead. However, Santorum's twin primary triumphs -- while narrow -- reframed the GOP race as a one-on-one battle between the socially conservative former Pennsylvania senator and the more moderate Romney, with Gingrich's chances fading fast. Texas Rep. Ron Paul, the libertarian champion, continued to trail well behind the other three candidates in the campaign to face President Barack Obama in November. ""There is no end in sight,"" noted Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor who was White House press secretary under President George W. Bush. ""... For Republicans who thought that maybe Mitt Romney could come South and make this race look like it was coming to an end, this race is going on and on and on."" Delegate tracker: Who's got what . The Alabama and Mississippi victories give Santorum wins in 10 states so far to Romney's 18, and he poked at the frontrunner on Wednesday as he reiterated his stance that he is the viable conservative alternative to the former Massachusetts governor. ""It's pretty sad when all you have is to do math instead of trying to go out there and win it on substance and win it on what Americans want to hear about,"" Santorum told CNN in reference to Romney's claim of an insurmountable lead in delegates. ""We're a long, long way from over."" Romney, meanwhile, seemed to get the message from frustrated supporters who asked him to turn away from delegate math, stop arguing about electability and stop attacking Santorum and instead focus on making a stronger case on why he deserves to be president. ""Look, I'm perfectly pleased with the process we have,"" Romney said Thursday on Fox News, acknowledging that his competitors are ""tough"" and ""capable."" Illinois and its 66 delegates once looked safe for Romney, but recent polls show it could go either way. After a stop in Missouri, Santorum has two events planned Friday in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He's also getting help in the form of a $310,000 purchase in Illinois from the Red, White and Blue Fund -- a super PAC that has been supportive of his candidacy. Romney is bringing in New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to campaign for him in the state on Friday. Christie, who's popular with Republicans across the country for his tough talk and tough actions in taking on Democrats in New Jersey, disappointed many in his party last October when he announced he would not launch his own presidential bid. Instead he endorsed Romney and has traveled to a number of primary and caucus states to stump for him, including Iowa. Gingrich, who based his campaign on a Southern strategy after winning South Carolina and Georgia, appeared to be in major trouble after losing both Dixie primaries Tuesday. And he'll be in the South again Friday, as he's scheduled to make several stops in Louisiana. ""The fact is that in both states, the conservative candidates got nearly 70% of the vote, and if you're the front-runner and you keep coming in third, you're not much of a frontrunner,"" Gingrich said of Romney's performance in Mississippi and Alabama. Citing what he called Romney's vulnerabilities on health care reform, Gingrich said he doesn't ""believe that a Massachusetts moderate who created Romneycare as the forerunner of Obamneycare is going to be in a position to win any debates this fall,"" and that is part of the reason he's ""insisted in staying in this race."" Calls for Gingrich to drop out and unite conservative support for Santorum have gotten louder since Tuesday, but Gingrich argues that none of the candidates are likely to reach the 1,144 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination before May or June at the earliest, and probably not until the August convention. Santorum and Romney are expected to split the next few contests on the calendar. After Puerto Rico and Illinois, Santorum is expected to win in Louisiana a week from Saturday. Then the race turns north and eastward -- the District of Columbia, Maryland and Wisconsin vote on April 3 and Romney is the early favorite. But that's three weeks away and much has changed in such a span in the most volatile Republican race in generations. CNN's Jim Acosta, Dana Bash, Tom Cohen, Peter Hamby, John Helton, Joe Johns, Alan Silverleib, Paul Steinhauser, Rachel Streitfeld and Chris Welch contributed to this report.","NEW: A pro-Santorum PAC buys $310,000 in ad time in Illinois .

"(CNN) -- Celebrity business magnate Donald Trump endorsed Mitt Romney for president Thursday, telling reporters he will not mount an independent campaign if Romney is the Republican nominee. Trump, who has repeatedly flirted with the possibility of his own White House bid, revealed his decision in Las Vegas two days before Nevada's Saturday caucuses. ""It's my honor, real honor, to endorse Mitt Romney,"" Trump said, with Romney and his wife standing nearby. Calling Romney ""tough"" and ""smart,"" Trump said, ""he's not going to continue to allow bad things to happen to this country."" Romney responded by praising Trump for ""an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works and to create jobs"" and for being ""one of the few who has stood up to say China is cheating"" in international trade. It was unclear whether Trump's decision will have any impact on the Republican race. A Pew survey last month found that 64% of definite and likely GOP voters said an endorsement from the reality television star would make no difference to them. In the survey, 13% said it would make them more likely to back a candidate, while 20% said it would actually make them less likely. ""Endorsements rarely sway voters,"" Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said. But ""the Trump endorsement undermines (Newt) Gingrich's argument that it is just the Washington establishment that is out to stop him and nominate Romney. Trump is the ultimate outsider."" Trump was not always so positive regarding Romney's record. During an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" in April, Trump criticized Romney for eliminating jobs while in the private sector. ""He'd buy companies. He'd close companies. He'd get rid of jobs,"" Trump told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. ""I've built a great company. My net worth is many many times Mitt Romney."" Asked what changed since then to bring his endorsement of Romney, Trump told CNN later Thursday that his past comments were ""political talk."" ""That was a long time prior to my getting to know him,"" Trump said of Romney. ""But I have gotten to know him and he's a terrific guy. I don't know if he really comes out like he really is in person. He's a warm, smart, tough cookie and that's what this country needs. We need somebody that's tough, that will stop China and OPEC and all these other nations from just ripping us up. And i think he can do it."" Perhaps in reference to Trump's earlier comments, Romney said Thursday after thanking Trump for the endorsement, ""I spent my life in the private sector, not quite as successful as this guy but successful nonetheless."" News of Trump's endorsement of the Republican front-runner came as the GOP candidates stumped for votes across Nevada and Romney continued to wrestle with fallout from a CNN interview in which the former Massachusetts governor said he wasn't ""concerned about the very poor."" Poll: Romney's big lead in Nevada . ""We have a safety net"" for the very poor, Romney told CNN's Soledad O'Brien on Wednesday. ""If it needs repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich; they're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of America, the 90%, 95% of Americans right now who are struggling, and I'll continue to take that message across the nation."" Pressed by O'Brien, Romney noted that the poorest Americans have access to food stamps, Medicaid and housing vouchers. ""You can choose where to focus,"" he said. ""You can focus on the rich; that's not my focus. You can focus on the very poor; that's not my focus. My focus is on middle-income Americans."" Romney later insisted that his words were taken out of context and reiterated the full context of the quote, which was meant to stress his focus on the middle class. ""You've got to take the whole sentence, (or else) it sounds very different,"" he said. ""We have a safety net for the poor. ... If there are people that are falling through the cracks, I want to fix that."" The comment, however, sparked a new round of debate over an emerging narrative of Romney as a plutocrat unaware of the needs and concerns of ordinary Americans. It also evoked memories of previous controversial Romney statements, such as when he said he likes firing people who provide poor service. Gingrich hammers Romney over 'poor' comment . Romney is ""reinforcing the image of the national party that is elite (and) out of touch,"" said Mark McKinnon, a former campaign adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain. ""That's why he's having such problems with independent voters. ... Unless the Republicans turn that around, they cannot win this election."" Gingrich, the former House speaker, has blasted Romney for the remark over the past two days, declaring Wednesday that he is ""fed up with politicians in either party dividing Americans against each other."" On Thursday, Gingrich said that ""we should care about the very poor -- unlike Governor Romney. But I believe that we should care differently than Barack Obama. Both Governor Romney and Barack Obama seem to believe that a 'safety net' is all the poor need. I don't believe that. What the poor need is a trampoline so they can spring up and quit being poor."" Gingrich press secretary fights off Trump questions . Regardless of the extent of Romney's verbal miscue, the former governor is now the clear Republican front-runner. A national poll released Wednesday showed an immediate benefit for Romney, putting him in first place at 31% compared to 26% for Gingrich, 16% for Santorum and 11% for Paul. The Gallup daily tracking poll had Gingrich ahead of Romney after the former speaker won the January 21 South Carolina primary. Romney cemented his status as the GOP leader with an overwhelming victory in Tuesday's Florida primary. Romney won the primary with 46% of the vote, compared with 32% for Gingrich, 13% for Rick Santorum and 7% for Ron Paul, according to the Florida Department of State. The victory gave Romney all 50 of Florida's convention delegates and, more important, new momentum heading into a series of caucuses and primaries building up to Super Tuesday on March 6, when 10 states will hold nominating contests. Zakaria: Why I can't wait for the Republican convention . Gingrich's campaign asked the Republican Party on Thursday to allocate the 50 Florida delegates on a proportional basis, rather than the winner-take-all format that gave them to Romney. In a letter to the Republican National Committee, the Gingrich campaign argued that an RNC rule says early primaries and caucuses must award delegates proportionally. However, party rules say the issue can be addressed only at the August nominating convention in Tampa, Florida. Santorum also has expressed support for Florida to change its system, but the Florida Republican Party chairman, Lenny Curry, said in a statement Thursday that won't happen. ""Florida was winner-take-all before election day, we were winner-take-all on election day, we will remain winner-take-all,"" Curry's statement said, adding: ""It is a shame when the loser of a contest agrees to the rules before, then cries foul after losing."" CNN's Tom Cohen, Jim Acosta, Paul Steinhauser and Alyssa McLendon contributed to this report.","NEW: Trump said he previously criticized Romney before getting to know him .

"(CNN) -- It was a triumph that came with joy from above. When Charlotte Dujardin stood on the podium celebrating her second Olympic gold medal of the London 2012 Olympics, she felt somebody watching over her and smiling. ""The girl with the dancing horse"" -- as she became known afterwards -- wowed the watching world as she claimed top honors in the team and individual dressage events. Joy was the order of the day -- and perhaps that was apt as it was her grandmother Joy's generous gift which allowed Dujardin to canter her way into the history books. ""Sometimes I do feel like she's up there looking down on me and watching me,"" the English equestrian told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""We were very close and she was very into horses too. She had a massive farm with lots of horses. I used to love going there and having so much fun. ""It was only down to her inheritance that we could afford the horse, so I do think about her quite often."" Making her way . To compete in the world of dressage takes talent, hard work, dedication and money. While there was no doubt about Dujardin's ability, the lack of finance remained a huge hurdle in her battle to make it to the highest level. Horses cost serious money, as do all the extras which come with owning an animal primed for the very top. ""My family didn't have lots of money or anything,"" the 27-year-old said. ""I literally did it through hard work and dedication. People out there who think you have to have loads of money to do this sport ... it just shows you. ""I worked six days a week for very little money. But I did it because I wanted to and I loved it. I set myself goals. For me it was a challenge."" With the inheritance left by her grandmother and the guidance of a determined mother, Dujardin moved from riding ponies to the world of dressage. It was the $27,000 purchase of her first horse Fernandez which allowed Dujardin to lay the groundwork for an astonishing rise through the sport. At the age of 15, she began her ascent, joining up with coach Judy Harvey and spending four years learning the ropes and working to earn a living. The mentor . But it was her meeting with Carl Hester, a British Olympian and professional dressage competitor, which helped steer her towards that glorious day in London. She made such an impression that she was offered a job as a groom at his yard in Newent, Gloucestershire, where she would go on to learn her trade. ""I got asked to do a world-class training day, and Carl was one of the selectors for that,"" she said. ""He actually rode my horse Fernandez, which I was absolutely over the moon about because obviously someone like that riding my horse was like a dream. ""I then got my mum to ask him if it was possible to have a lesson. So I met him at our national championships at Stoneleigh and he said he would give me a lesson. ""I had four lessons; he asked if I would do 10 days' cover. I did it and I never went home."" Hester, the youngest British rider to ever compete at an Olympics as a 25-year-old in 1992, saw something special in Dujardin and handed her the horse which would transform her life forever. Love at first sight . Valegro, or ""Blueberry"" as he is known within the stables, turned out to be a ""dream horse."" Too young to compete at a Grand Prix event, the top level of competition, Hester wanted Valegro to learn the trade under his young apprentice. ""I just fell in love with Valegro when I saw him,"" Dujardin said. ""He was just a powerhouse at four years old. He had paces then that he couldn't control and he had a fabulous temperament. ""He was my dream horse. And then I managed to take him out and compete him at all the young horse classes."" In their seven years together, the pair have become near inseparable, with Duajardin describing him as ""my best friend and my partner."" From their first Grand Prix together in 2011, a journey which took five years in the making, the duo have not looked back. ""He always wants to please you,"" she said. ""He goes into that arena to do his best. He never lets you down. He's with you all the way. ""To find a horse that can cope with all the atmosphere as well is very difficult. He just does it all. ""As a rider he gives you so much confidence. You go in there and you know you can do it because you know he's behind you. ""I think it was the connection we had, the fact we'd learned everything together. If I got it wrong, or if he made a mistake, between the two of us we both learned how to get it right. ""That is what was so good. He was forgiving my mistakes and I was forgiving him."" International success . The relationship has blossomed beautifully, and they were part of the British team which won gold at the 2011 European Dressage Championship at Rotterdam. Dujardin and Valegro then won the FEI World Cup Grand Prix at London Olympia in 2011, and set a new world points record at the Olympic Grand Prix special event the following year. It was the prelude to the most exciting and most daunting challenge of Dujardin's career -- the London Olympics. Competing in both the team and individual event in front of a home crowd might have left lesser riders with stage fright -- but not Dujardin. ""I see the arena, the competition arena, as an arena at home,"" she said. ""I do the same thing wherever I am, whether it's at home or at a competition. ""I never think of who's in the competition. I never let myself get in that frame of mind, worrying about who I'm against. ""I keep myself away, I keep myself very focused. I keep myself in that zone of what I have to do and deliver. I'm really lucky that I can control my nerves; it doesn't seem to get to me."" London calling . Just 18 months after making her Grand Prix debut, Dujardin headed out onto Greenwich Park as part of the British team seeking to win its first ever medal in dressage since 1912. The discipline was originally used to train horses during the Renaissance period. The ""piaffe"" is a signature move where the horse jogs on the spot, while there are also the ""flying changes"" -- where it skips on alternate legs. Following two controlled rounds, where competitors are marked out of 10 and awarded a percentage score, they then go on to perform a freestyle routine. Riding alongside her mentor Hester and Laura Bechtolsheimer -- granddaughter of a German billionaire -- it was a dream come true. With 23,000 people packed inside the arena and the world watching on, Dujardin delivered in style, becoming the new Olympic score record-holder with 83.286%. ""We had high expectations to deliver that gold medal,"" she revealed. ""Everybody expected us to win it, we had such a strong team. But you know at the end of the day they are horses. ""You never know what can happen. And I think it probably put pressure on us a little bit more that everybody expected that. ""But I'm the sort of person, I don't think of things like that. I just do my best. And that's what I did."" The victory of the British team reverberated around the world as it finally broke the German stranglehold on the sport. Magic moment . But for Dujardin there was still work to do. ""Going into the individual, I honestly was going to be absolutely delighted with any medal,"" she said. ""I wasn't even thinking of getting the gold. I was thinking any medal would be amazing. ""And you know, I went in there, and Adelinde Cornelissen had just come out with a huge score of 88%. ""They announced that just before I was going in. So I heard that as I was going down."" The Dutch rider's score had left Dujardin requiring an Olympic record to claim top spot, but that didn't faze the home favorite, who was the final competitor to perform. ""I went in there and I thought, 'Do you know what, I can do this, I know I can do this,' "" she said. ""And I went in there and I can't even tell you how it felt. It was just indescribable."" Sitting on her beloved Valegro, Dujardin had the horse dancing majestically to the sounds of ""Land of Hope and Glory,"" ""The Great Escape"" and the chimes of London's iconic Big Ben. The beautifully artistic routine appeared to compensate for any technical deficiencies as she wowed the judges. 'A dream come true' ""The moment I finished my test it was like uproar,"" she recalled. ""It was like everybody screaming, shouting and standing. It was unbelievable. ""And I didn't know I'd won. I looked over and there was this lady hanging over the stadium, and she said, 'You've done it! You've done it!' ""And I'm looking, and then I heard the crowd just go crazy. And then I realized I'd actually got the individual gold. And for me that was just unbelievable. ""To think in 18 months what I had achieved and come away with. Just to be at the Olympics in your home ground anyway was a huge achievement for me. ""But then to come away with two gold medals was a dream come true."" Dujardin received an overall mark of 90.089 in the individual event, which was lifted by a mammoth 93.429 for artistic merit. ""I still find it really hard to let it all sink in what I've achieved, because everything happened so quickly,"" she said. ""From 2011 to 2012 I didn't stop. We just kept going. Then you stop and you sit down and you look back at what you've done and what you've achieved."" It certainly would have made her grandmother proud.","Charlotte Dujardin won two gold medals at the London Olympic Games .

"(CNN) -- As we gear up for the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, allow us to turn the focus to the real winners of the show: besties Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Ever since the pair impressed viewers with their hosting capabilities, there have been calls for them to helm any and all such events. It seems like fans can't get enough of their hilarity, and all eyes will once again be on them to keep the Globes flowing. In honor of the BFFs whose friendship and careers have been pretty impressive, here are five trivia facts about Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and the duo that is TAmy (as we like to call them, because that's what you do with beloved Hollywood couples). Tina Fey: . 1) You really could call her Liz . Fey will always be known as the woman who gave us the quirky character of Liz Lemon on ""30 Rock."" But did you know that her real name is Elizabeth Stamatina Fey? 2) And just like Liz Lemon ... She's a self-described ""supernerd,"" having spent her teen years hanging out at game nights instead of dating. 3) She made 'Saturday Night Live' history . In addition to being one of the stars of the late-night comedy show, the show's creator and producer Lorne Michaels hired Fey as a writer in 1995, and she would later become the show's first female head writer. 4) Fey is a 'Mean Girl' One of the greatest achievements we would like to thank her for is writing the script for the now almost cult classic 2004 film, ""Mean Girls."" Fey also appeared in the movie as Ms. Norbury. 5) '30 Rock' had a family connection . Fey is married to composer Jeff Richmond, who wrote music for her hit NBC show. The couple are the parents of two daughters. Special coverage: Awards season 2014 . Amy Poehler: . 1) She's got a theater in New York City . Poehler is one of the co-founders of New York's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, which sprang from the original improv group in Chicago where she got her start. The theater offers affordable comedy shows and Poehler has been known to pop up here and there in more than a few. 2) Poehler is tied to history . The actress made her ""SNL"" cast member debut on the first show after 9/11. 3) She's also made some history . Snagging a gig on ""SNL"" isn't easy, but Poehler managed to be promoted from bit player to full cast member in her first season -- the first woman to do so. 4) Girl power! She may be a celeb, but Poehler isn't too big to take it to YouTube with her Amy Poehler's Smart Girls series, where she interviews interesting women and answers questions from fans. 5) Fey has her beat . The ""Parks & Rec"" actress has never won an Emmy, though she and Fey have competed against one another for best actress in a comedy series four times. Neither has won in those years, though Fey won in 2008 before Poehler was nominated. Keep up to date with the Awards tracker . The pair: . 1) Improv brought them together . The aspiring actresses met in a 1993 improv class where Poehler was reportedly impressed by Fey's joke about Catherine the Great. 2) They are used to working together . Ever since Poehler became co-anchor with Fey of SNL's ""Weekend Update"" in 2004 they have worked together, including in the 2009 film ""Baby Mama."" 3) Flip sides of the mommy coin . Both women take motherhood very seriously and have spoken lovingly of their roles as moms. But while Fey has two daughters, Poehler has two sons. 4) People like them together . An evening with the pair was once auctioned, raising $72,000 for charity. 5) You will be seeing more of them . The Golden Globes organizers were smart enough to lock Fey and Poehler in to a two-year contract to host the show.","Guess how Tina Fey and Amy Poehler met?

"(CNN) -- Concern over the spread of the Ebola virus has caused the cancellation of an African Cup of Nations football match. The Seychelles was due to host Sierra Leone in a qualifying game on Saturday, but the tiny island nation's ministries of health and immigration prevented the visiting players from entering the country. At least 525 cases of Ebola have been reported in Sierra Leone since March, 224 of which have been fatal. Seychelles, which was trailing 2-0 after losing the away leg of the second-round qualifier in Sierra Leone on July 19, has forfeited both the tie and its hopes of reaching next year's tournament finals. Sierra Leone players were on Friday reportedly prevented from boarding a plane at Kenya's Nairobi Airport that would have taken them to the Seychelles. Seychelles Football Federation president Elvis Chetty told CNN that there was little choice but to follow government advice and forfeit the match, which was to be held in the capital Victoria. ""After being advised by the ministry of health to postpone the match for an indefinite period, the ministry of immigration informed us it would not allow the team from Sierra Leone to enter the Seychelles,"" Chetty said. ""Subsequently, the SFF felt it was prudent to forfeit the scheduled match as opposed to asking for a postponement. ""We respect the decisions taken by the authorities to safeguard the health interests of our country. ""Our thoughts are with the Sierra Leone people in their hour of need."" There have been more than 1,300 confirmed or suspected Ebola cases in West Africa since March, when cases of the virus were first reported in Guinea. Other countries to be affected include Liberia and Nigeria. Sierra Leone president Ernest Bai Koroma has declared a public health emergency in his country in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus. One of the country's athletes at the Commonwealth Games in Scotland was taken to hospital last week to be tested for Ebola after feeling unwell. However, cyclist Moses Sesay was cleared and was able to compete in Thursday's men's individual time trial. Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever, affecting multiple organs and accompanied by bleeding. There is no known cure or specific treatments. The World Health Organization has said that drastic action is needed to contain what has fast become the worst outbreak on record.","Sierra Leone football players prevented from entering Seychelles over Ebola fears .

"(CNN) -- Some people see The Hague as Amsterdam's more sedate (read stodgier) cousin. Fact is, The Hague can be a welcome, peaceful diversion from the nonstop energy (read crowds) of Amsterdam. The streets are wider, the buildings grander and thanks to nearly 1,000 acres of green space, The Hague is a place where you can catch your breath and take in your surroundings at a leisurely pace. You may know it as home of the International Court of Justice, a city of diplomats, the seat of the Dutch government, the official residence of King Willem-Alexander and maybe even as the home of the notorious World War I spy, Mata Hari. (Her former residence is the pretty but nondescript Nieuwe Uitleg 16.) It's also a city rich in the arts. Less than an hour by train takes you to The Hague -- Den Haag -- from Amsterdam. Here are a few of the most intriguing things to see when you go: . Mauritshuis museum . Topping the list is this jewel box of a museum, which reopened on June 27 after a two-year renovation. The project connected the original 17th-century residential building to an early 20th-century building across the street via an underground passage. In the process, the museum doubled its size yet left most everything at street level unscathed. You'll visit -- as everyone does -- to see Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl With a Pearl Earring."" She's flanked by two equally charming domestic scenes by Dutch Golden Age painter Gerard ter Borch. In an adjacent room is ""The Goldfinch"" by Carel Fabritius, now best known as cover art on Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Other paintings you'll recognize include Rembrandt's ""The Anatomy Lesson of Doctor Nicolaes Tulp,"" a portrait of Jane Seymour by Hans Holbein the Younger, ""Laughing Boy"" by Frans Hals, and ""Old Woman and Boy with Candles"" by Peter Paul Rubens. The genius of the Mauritshuis is its small but exceptional collection -- 800 paintings, with about 260 on display here and another 150 at the Prince William V Gallery. ""As you go through the rooms you see masterpieces everywhere,"" says museum director Emilie Gordenker. ""There is so much to see, but not too much."" www.mauritshuis.nl . Gemeentemuseum . At the opposite end of the Dutch art continuum is Piet Mondrian, the modern artist and proponent of the holistic art movement known as De Stijl. The Gemeentemuseum contains the world's largest collection of Mondrian's work presented in a chronological display that lets you appreciate the evolution of his style from realism to the abstract blocks of primary colors for which he's famous. The highlight is ""Victory Boogie Woogie,"" left unfinished with bits of masking tape still in place on the surface of the canvas when Mondrian died in 1944. You'll see it behind the waves of tourists posing in front of it, one of whom was President Barack Obama when he visited The Hague for the International Nuclear Security Summit in March. The museum also has an excellent permanent collection of Delftware ceramics and will open a major retrospective of American modern artist Mark Rothko starting September 20. www.gemeentemuseum.nl/en/ . Peace Palace . To the world at large, The Hague is most closely associated with the Peace Palace, which houses the International Court of Justice, the judicial arm of the United Nations. Constructed between 1907 and 1913, the grand Peace Palace seems to embody the international unity it was intended to foster: A French architect designed the structure built of Dutch brick and Belgian stone, with German iron gates at the entrance, English stained glass in the windows, a Swiss clock in the clock tower and so on. Ironically, World War I commenced a year after the Peace Palace opened, effectively quashing the dreams of world peace its founders envisioned. Although the visitors' center is open regularly, guided tours of the building are conducted sporadically based on the court's schedule. The current window for visits runs through August 27. If you happen to be in town, take advantage of the opportunity to see the Peace Palace from the inside. Should you be interested in watching international courts at work, trials at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, in a separate courthouse nearby, are open to the public. www.vredespaleis.nl . Het Binnenhof . The seat of the Dutch parliament is Het Binnenhof, a complex of buildings with roots that extend to the 13th century. The Ridderzaal, or Hall of Knights, is the most interesting and historic of them. In the 15th century, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, held meetings with his Knights of the Golden Fleece here. His son, Charles the Bold, used it as a court of law. On its vaulted ceiling, made to resemble the inverted hull of a ship, are the carved heads of ""eavesdroppers"" -- little men with big ears who heard everything, prevented secrecy and conspiracy and ensured that justice was served. Today, it's a ceremonial venue, especially important on Prince's Day (the third Tuesday of September), when the reigning monarch makes a speech to begin the new parliamentary year. English audio tours and brochures are available for the parliament buildings. Tours with historical or political themes are conducted by ProDemos, a nonpartisan, government-funded, nonprofit created to educate the public and encourage participation in the political process. english.prodemos.nl . Escher in Het Paleis . It's rare to find an artist whose admirers include a devoted community of mathematicians, but such is the case with M.C. Escher. The 20th-century artist is known for his graphic optical art linking infinity and impossibility, which famously inspired the great British mathematicians Lionel and Roger Penrose (not to mention the fashion designer Alexander McQueen) and has graced an incalculable number of dorm room walls. The Escher Museum is actually three museums in one: the building itself is the former working palace of four generations of Dutch queens; the rooms contain whimsical crystal chandeliers by contemporary artist Hans van Bentem (Madonna owns one); and then of course there is the Escher artwork. All the museums mentioned here have programs designed to appeal to children, but Escher might be the artist that will blow their little minds (in a good way!), particularly when they reach the optical illusion room. www.escherinhetpaleis.nl/ . Panorama Mesdag . And speaking of optical illusion ... long before the IMAX theater, people wrapped their heads around the panoramic paintings of the 19th century -- full 360-degree visual experiences intended to transport the viewer to another place and time. In their heyday there were hundreds of them, depicting subjects from ancient Jerusalem to the battle of Waterloo, each displayed like a carnival attraction in a cylindrical structure specially built for the purpose. Only 23 survive (one is the Cyclorama in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, depicting Pickett's Charge). The Panorama Mesdag, painted by Hendrik Willem Mesdag in just four months, is one of the finest examples, not least because it's displayed in its original structure. Although you're standing just 14 meters (45 feet) away from the 120-by-14-meter (393-by-45-foot) canvas, your eye is fooled into believing you're seeing the Dutch seaside resort of Scheveningen from a great distance. Because the painting is illuminated by natural light, the view literally changes with the time of day and the weather. In its quiet way, it's a marvel. Even Vincent van Gogh thought so; he attended the panorama's opening in 1881. panorama-mesdag.com . Scheveningen . The real seaside at Scheveningen is a quick tram ride or an easy bike ride from the city center. It no longer resembles the 19th-century coastal enclave depicted in the Panorama Mesdag, but it remains a popular ""day out"" spot for residents of The Hague. The centerpiece is the Steigenberger Kurhaus Hotel, a 19th-century bath hotel that gained a certain infamy when the Rolling Stones played there on August 8, 1964. They were four songs into their set when a riot ensued, and police were called in to shut down the show. That event largely ended the hotel's days as a rock venue, although Bon Jovi played there in 2010. The beach offers a boardwalk lined with kiosks and amusements, a lighthouse and the chance to cool your toes in the North Sea, plus the picturesque dunes that have drawn nature lovers to the area for centuries.","The Hague is home to the newly renovated Mauritshuis museum .

"(CNN) -- In an apparent first at the tradition-minded Supreme Court, an advocacy group surreptitiously recorded video of an oral argument that was interrupted by a spectator. The group 99Rise.org, which supports campaign finance reform, posted the video of Wednesday's proceedings on YouTube as part of a protest over the issue. No electronic devices, or still or video cameras are permitted in the court's public sessions. All spectators, including members of the media, are screened with magnetometers at the entrance to the ornate courtroom. There was no immediate explanation of how a camera was smuggled past security. ""The court became aware today of the video posted on YouTube,"" court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement. ""Court officials are in the process of reviewing the video and our courtroom screening procedures."" The taping as well as an interruption by a spectator who witnesses said began talking loudly about campaign finance reform, apparently occurred near the end of arguments in a patent case. The video confirms what witnesses told CNN-- that the well-dressed man spoke about the need to keep campaign finance reform laws in place to regulate election spending and contributions. ""Money is not speech,"" he said. ""Overturn 'Citizens United!'"" referring to a 2010 high court decision loosening a century of federal restrictions on corporate spending by ""independent"" groups like businesses and unions. Noah Newkirk of Los Angeles was only able say a few words before police escorted him from the courtroom, and he did not resist. Newkirk was charged with violating federal law that makes it a crime to ""harangue"" or utter ""loud threatening or abusive language"" in the Supreme Court building. The justices ignored the incident. Court officials said the last disturbance was eight years ago during an oral argument over an abortion-related issue. A similar interruption occurred about two decades ago. There are only two photographs of the court in session -- and those cameras were smuggled in -- in the 1930s. CNN and other media outlets have been allowed to shoot video and still pictures of the empty courtroom. Sketch artists are allowed to portray the oral arguments and other public sessions of the court. There have been calls for years to allow cameras in the court, for public benefit. A new television ad released last week urged the justices to do just that saying, ""It's time for a more open judiciary."" The sponsor of the commercials is the Coalition for Court Transparency, not affiliated with the group that secretly recorded the oral argument Wednesday. The biggest concerns raised by the justices are that cameras would upset the personal dynamic between them that make oral arguments so unique and useful to their later deliberations and opinion-writing. The courtroom has about 330 seats available to the public. Court security instructs spectators before each public session to remain seated, not to speak, or demonstrate.","Advocacy group on campaign finance reform recorded video during an oral argument .

"(CNN) -- Rick Santorum awoke to a new reality Wednesday after sweeping all three Republican presidential contests a day earlier, reshaping the contest that will decide who runs against President Barack Obama in November. Santorum won caucuses in Minnesota and Colorado, as well as a nonbinding primary in Missouri to energize his campaign and raise questions about front-runner Mitt Romney's ability to attract broad conservative support. The victories by Santorum bolstered his contention that he is the strongest conservative challenger to the more moderate Romney for the GOP nomination, and the most formidable conservative candidate to take on Obama. ""I don't stand here and claim to be the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney,"" Santorum declared to cheering supporters outside St. Louis. ""I stand here to be the conservative alternative to Barack Obama."" Colorado was the most competitive state of the day, with Santorum winning 40% of the vote to 35% for Romney, 13% for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and 12% for Texas Rep. Ron Paul. After a night of returns trickling in and the lead shifting between Santorum and Romney, Colorado Republican Party chairman Ryan Call announced live on CNN that Santorum was the winner. In Minnesota, Santorum got 45% of the vote to 27% for Paul, 17% for Romney and 11% for Gingrich, with 88% of the total counted, according to the secretary of state. The victory in a state Romney won in his unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid was a strong statement by Santorum that he represents a major conservative challenge to both Romney and Gingrich. However, a low turnout in all three races signaled possible dissatisfaction among Republican voters with the candidates. All the 70 delegates available Tuesday came from the Minnesota and Colorado caucuses, while the Missouri primary was nonbinding with no delegates at stake. The two caucus states didn't officially award delegates Tuesday night -- that will happen down the road at district and state conventions -- but the news media, including CNN, will use them to make unofficial delegate count estimates. With 100% of the Missouri vote counted, Santorum had 55% to 25% for Romney and 12% for Paul, according to unofficial results. Gingrich didn't make the ballot in Missouri. Such a dominating victory by the conservative Santorum showed his appeal to Missouri's large blocs of evangelical and tea party supporters. ""Conservatism is alive and well in Missouri and Minnesota,"" Santorum declared before the Colorado count had been completed. While Tuesday was a stunningly successful night for Santorum, it was a terrible night for Romney and Gingrich, who has been competing with Santorum for the support of conservatives against the more moderate Romney. Gingrich spent little time or money in the three states, instead focusing his now limping campaign on the Super Tuesday contests of March 6 that will be worth more than 400 delegates from 10 states. Romney, however, campaigned hard in Colorado and to a lesser degree Minnesota, and the stinging losses cost him any momentum from his two straight victories in Florida and Nevada prior to Tuesday. A senior adviser to Romney signaled the campaign would take a tougher approach toward his resurgent rival and portray him as a Washington insider. ""Look, I just don't think it's a time when people are looking to Washington to solve problems with Washington,"" senior Romney adviser Stuart Stevens said of Santorum, a former U.S. senator. Stevens downplayed Tuesday's results, saying: ""We'd like to win everywhere, but you can't. And we've focused on key states for how we see a path to the nomination."" In Denver, Romney congratulated Santorum for his good night before the Colorado result was known. Rather than continuing criticism of Santorum, Romney sounded conciliatory in saying Republicans would unite behind the eventual nominee and that he expected to be that candidate. Perhaps in response to Santorum's success, Romney struck a populist note by telling the crowd how his father never graduated college but went on to head a business and become governor of Michigan. ""For my dad, this was the land of opportunity,"" Romney said, later adding: ""I refuse to believe America is just another place on earth with a map. We stand for freedom and hope and opportunity."" To Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chair from Florida, Tuesday's results showed an underlying weakness in Romney's candidacy. ""What should have been a night where he began to consolidate Republican support instead has shown that Republicans are reluctant to get behind him,"" Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. ""Republicans are giving the field of candidates another look, demonstrating that the more people get to know Mitt Romney, the less they like him. They know he'll say anything to get elected, and they don't want a candidate they can't trust."" She also cited ""the lack of enthusiasm and low turnout we're seeing in these contests,"" adding that ""no candidate embodies that dissatisfaction more than Mitt Romney."" In Missouri, a state official told CNN that the turnout would be ""significantly lower than predicted."" The secretary of state's office had estimated turnout would be 23%. Romney's campaign appeared to consider Colorado its best chance of victory Tuesday. He canceled stops in Minnesota scheduled for Monday to concentrate on Colorado, where he spent caucus night. Romney, who won big in the state's 2008 caucuses, has been working Colorado since last summer and arguably has the strongest structure in the state. Santorum needed victories or an overall strong showing to prove the viability of his campaign. ""I think we need to win in the sense that we need to perform very well,"" he told CNN's John King earlier Tuesday. Paul, meanwhile, predicted his focus on the caucus states would yield results. He spent the past week stumping in Colorado and Minnesota, and spent Tuesday night in Minnesota. ""We're gonna win some delegates. Whether we come in one or two or three, I don't know exactly that,"" Paul said on CNN's ""John King USA."" ""But we feel positive about moving along and picking up more delegates. We'll have to wait and see."" Paul stressed his strength in the upcoming Maine caucuses on Saturday. ""Nobody else is about to at this point jump ahead of Romney,"" Paul said. ""But we think we're going to keep doing. We have a very good chance on what's happening up in Maine."" Gingrich had gotten a late start in Colorado and Minnesota, and failed to get on the ballot in Missouri. The former speaker is looking ahead to Super Tuesday in what he hopes will be friendlier territory in his native Georgia and other conservative states. As part of that strategy, Gingrich spent Tuesday night in Ohio, one of the Super Tuesday states. In an interview with KOA Radio in Denver, Colorado, Gingrich said Romney's multimillion-dollar attack campaign against him has paved the way for Santorum to do well on Tuesday. ""The guy who hasn't been attacked has gained some ground and has done a good job, worked very hard and so my prediction is when tonight's over between Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri, the whole race will be muddled and Romney's role as the frontrunner will be deeply discounted as compared to where it was a week ago,"" said Gingrich, speaking from Ohio. After weeks of bitter campaigning in Florida and Nevada, the candidates have focused on Obama in recent days. Romney, Gingrich and Santorum criticized the president over the administration's new rules requiring all hospitals -- including those run by the Catholic church -- to provide workers health insurance that covers contraception, including sterilization, which the church opposes. Obama's re-election campaign has pushed back on Romney's criticism, pointing to his refusal when governor of Massachusetts to exempt Catholic hospitals from providing emergency contraception to rape victims. ""Mitt Romney continues to show that he will do or say anything to get elected,"" Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said. ""He is even attacking the president for providing women with the same access to contraception and preventive health care services that he did as governor of Massachusetts. And now, in an effort to pander to the most conservative parts of the Republican base, he has embraced the extreme personhood amendment, which would ban many forms of birth control, including birth control pills. ""This sends a clear message to women across America,"" Smith added. ""Mitt Romney can't be trusted and his hypocrisy knows no bounds."" Gingrich also pounced on Romney's stance Tuesday, telling an Ohio crowd: ""The fact is Governor Romney insisted that Catholic hospitals give out abortion pills against their religious belief when he was governor. So you have a very similar pattern again. Over and over you get the same pattern. And I think a Massachusetts moderate finds it very hard to draw a sharp contrast with someone who is an Illinois radical."" Whether Paul, Gingrich, or Santorum will have the financial resources to compete with Romney over the long haul remains an open question. Obama's campaign, however, remains well-financed. In a major development for the general election, the president's re-election team encouraged donors Monday night to start raising money for a Democratic super PAC -- a reversal of his previous stance on the issue. Obama has been an outspoken critic of current campaign financing laws, most notably the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that allowed the creation of super PACs. Until now he has kept his distance from the Democratic group, Priorities USA Action, which has lagged behind its Republican counterparts in fundraising. ""The president's views ... haven't changed,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. ""He strongly opposed"" the Supreme Court ruling in 2010 and ""holds those views today."" But ""the rules are what they are,"" Carney added. The president's campaign ""cannot compete effectively if there are two sets of rules,"" and the Democrats ""cannot unilaterally disarm.""

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Earthquake victims, writhing in pain and grasping at life, watched doctors and nurses walk away from a field hospital Friday night after a Belgian medical team evacuated the area, saying it was concerned about security. The decision left CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta as the only doctor at the hospital to get the patients through the night. CNN initially reported, based on conversations with some of the doctors, that the United Nations ordered the Belgian First Aid and Support Team to evacuate. However, Belgian Chief Coordinator Geert Gijs, a doctor who was at the hospital with 60 Belgian medical personnel, said it was his decision to pull the team out for the night. Gijs said he requested U.N. security personnel to staff the hospital overnight, but was told that peacekeepers would only be able to evacuate the team. He said it was a ""tough decision"" but that he accepted the U.N. offer to evacuate after a Canadian medical team, also at the hospital with Canadian security officers, left the site Friday afternoon. The Belgian team returned Saturday morning. Gijs said the United Nations has agreed to provide security for Saturday night. The team has requested the Belgian government to send its own troops for the field hospital, which Gijs expects to arrive late Sunday. Responding to the CNN report that Gupta was the only doctor left at the Port-au-Prince field hospital, U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said Saturday that the world body's mission in Haiti did not order any medical team to leave. If the team left, it was at the request of their own organization, he said. Edmond Mulet, the U.N. assistant secretary general for peacekeeping operations, told reporters later that local security officers deemed the makeshift hospital unsafe. ""It seems that we've heard some reports in the international media that the United Nations asked or forced some medical teams to not work any more in some clinic -- that is not true, that is completely untrue,"" Mulet said Saturday. CNN video from the scene Friday night shows the Belgian team packing up its supplies and leaving with an escort of blue-helmeted U.N. peacekeepers in marked trucks. View or add to CNN's database of missing persons in Haiti . Gupta -- assisted by other CNN staffers, security personnel and at least one Haitian nurse who refused to leave -- assessed the needs of the 25 patients, but there was little they could do without supplies. More people, some in critical condition, were trickling in late Friday. ""I've never been in a situation like this. This is quite ridiculous,"" Gupta said. With a dearth of medical facilities in Haiti's capital, ambulances had nowhere else to take patients, some of whom had suffered severe trauma -- amputations and head injuries -- under the rubble. Others had suffered a great deal of blood loss, but there were no blood supplies left at the clinic. Gupta feared that some would not survive the night. He and the others stayed with the injured all night, after the medical team had left and after the generators gave out and the tents turned pitch black. Gupta monitored patients' vital signs, administered painkillers and continued intravenous drips. He stabilized three new patients in critical condition. At 3:45 a.m., he posted a message on Twitter: ""pulling all nighter at haiti field hosp. lots of work, but all patients stable. turned my crew into a crack med team tonight."" Are you in Haiti and safe? Share your photos . He said the Belgian doctors did not want to leave their patients behind but were ordered out by the United Nations, which sent buses to transport them. ""There is concern about riots not far from here -- and this is part of the problem,"" Gupta said. There have been scattered reports of violence throughout the capital. ""What is striking to me as a physician is that patients who just had surgery, patients who are critically ill, are essentially being left here, nobody to care for them,"" Gupta said. Sandra Pierre, a Haitian who has been helping at the makeshift hospital, said the medical staff took most of the supplies with them. ""All the doctors, all the nurses are gone,"" she said. ""They are expected to be back tomorrow. They had no plan on leaving tonight. It was an order that came suddenly."" She told Gupta, ""It's just you."" A 7.0 magnitude earthquake flattened Haiti's capital city Tuesday afternoon, affecting as many as 3 million people as it fanned out across the island nation. Tens of thousands of people are feared dead. Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere, lacked adequate medical resources even before the disaster and has been struggling this week to tend to huge numbers of injured. The clinic, set up under several tents, was a godsend to the few who were lucky to have been brought there. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who led relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said the evacuation of the clinic's medical staff was unforgivable. ""Search and rescue must trump security,"" HonorÃ© said. ""I've never seen anything like this before in my life. They need to man up and get back in there."" HonorÃ© drew parallels between the tragedy in New Orleans, Louisiana, and in Port-au-Prince. But even in the chaos of Katrina, he said, he had never seen medical staff walk away. ""I find this astonishing these doctors left,"" he said. ""People are scared of the poor."" CNN's Justine Redman, Danielle Dellorto and John Bonifield contributed to this report.","NEW: Belgian team chief says he decided to leave when U.N. could not provide security .

"(CNN) -- Patrick Vieira knows what it takes to win football's greatest prize -- and the former France star believes Africa is close to claiming a historic first World Cup title. Only three teams from the continent have ever reached the quarterfinal stage of the tournament -- Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010 -- yet none have made it to the last four. Despite high expectations, first sparked by Pele's prediction in 1977 that ""an African nation will win the World Cup before the year 2000,"" there have been a series of disappointments. Undoubted talent has often fallen foul to ill-discipline on the pitch, arguments off it, ego problems, administrative issues and sheer bad luck. Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Algeria will all be hoping to overcome these hurdles in Brazil this time and perhaps go even further than their predecessors. And Vieira, who helped France to World Cup glory on home soil in 1998 -- coming on as a substitute to set up Emmanuel Petit's goal in the shock 3-0 final win over Brazil -- is convinced it will not be too long before an African champion is crowned. ""I believe (they can) and I really hope they will win the World Cup in the near future because I think that will help African football to develop even better, even more,"" says Vieira, who was born in Senegal but moved to France as an eight-year-old. ""And when you look at how many big names African football has produced in the last few years, it's unbelievable,"" he told CNN. Those big names include the likes of Samuel Eto'o, Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure, who would all love nothing more than to add a World Cup winners' medal to their lengthy list of honors in Brazil. But while Cameroon and Ivory Coast have such world-beaters among their ranks, Vieira feels they will need to be at the top of their game to avoid past disappointments. Quality . Ivory Coast has earned the nickname ""the chokers"" -- cruel given the quality of opposition the nation has faced -- after a talented set of individuals struggled to perform when it counted most, failing to make it out of the group stage in both the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. ""You need quality. When you look at the African national teams individually, they are really talented so they've got talent,"" Vieira says. ""But I think to be in the World Cup, you need your talented players to be at their best because the quality will make you win, the quality will make the difference. ""Quality will make the player make the difference at the right time when your team needs you. You may just go on to create one chance and you need to score the chance to go to the next round."" Vieira, though, believes that for talented players to flourish they must be in a team that has togetherness and unity. Cameroon lacked in that department during its disastrous 2010 campaign, where the ""Indomitable Lions"" had been expected to do well in the first World Cup held on African soil. Eto'o threatened to snub the competition after being criticized by compatriot Roger Milla, himself a former World Cup star for Cameroon. And when he did turn up, the four-time African player of the year -- who had just won the European Champions League for the third time, on this occasion with Inter Milan -- struggled in South Africa after not being used in his customary striker's role. Arsenal's Alex Song, meanwhile, found himself on the bench and coach Paul Le Guen was forced to quit after the team failed to register a point for the first time in six appearances at the finals. ""I would say togetherness (is important), and I think if you want to do well in the championship, in the World Cup, the team has to be together,"" Vieira says. ""It has to fight for the same objective and I believe that togetherness will make them go to the end."" Unity . Togetherness certainly played a role in France's 1998 win. Aime Jacquet's squad was seen as representing a new France, with Vieira born in Senegal, Marcel Desailly from Ghana, Lilian Thuram from Guadeloupe, Zinedine Zidane's family hailing from Algeria, while others were of Polish and Armenian descent. ""We had the players from all around the world and I think we showed the diversity of the French national team, we showed what the diversity of the French people are,"" Vieira says. ""We showed to the French nation what France is really."" If an African side's unity can ever be questioned then it could be argued that it has been a result of African football's structural failings. The Federation Camerounaise de Football temporarily suspended Eto'o from playing for the national team in 2011 for instigating the boycott of a friendly in Algeria over unpaid bonuses. Emmanuel Adebayor, meanwhile, has criticized the Togo Federation in the past for its poor organizational skills, blaming the governing body for his late return to English club Tottenham following the 2013 African Cup of Nations. ""The only problem in Africa is our leaders, who do not respect us,"" Eto'o told the Confederation of African Football's (CAF) official website. ""Until we are respected, other (continents) will never have any consideration for us."" Vieira adds: ""I think what African football needs is better organization, better structure, and I think after that we'll help the players to be more professional when they're coming to play for their national team ... I think the structure around these players is not strong enough and I think if we don't have that, it will take time (for an African nation) to win the World Cup."" The man in charge of African football -- CAF president Issa Hayatou -- however, feels the structures put in place by his confederation and its member associations should allow for a nation or two to go far in Brazil. ""I do not see why Africa cannot have one or two of our representatives reach the semifinals or even the final,"" he told CAF's official website. Discipline . Two representatives from Africa reaching the semifinals or final would make for huge progress, given that there has never been more than one at a time to reach the knockout stages. That statistic could well have been banished in 1998 had Cameroon's players kept their heads when it mattered most. The Indomitable Lions picked up three red cards in just three games, including two in the final group clash against Chile -- a match they drew, when victory would have been enough for a place in the second round alongside Nigeria. ""I would talk about discipline (as being vital if an African team wants to win the World Cup),"" Vieira says. ""Discipline and sacrifice, so that means you have to concentrate on your objective, you have to concentrate on what you have to do for the months to get at your best, and be at the peak of your game."" Focus . Hand-in-hand with discipline often comes focus -- something Nigeria lost for a split-second in 1994, denying the team a quarterfinal spot, long before Senegal and Ghana's heroics. The Super Eagles were just two minutes away from becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight at their debut World Cup, but let a 1-0 lead slip against Italy before conceding again in extra-time. ""(You must) focus on your objective because when you are in the World Cup, you can get your head a little bit all over the place,"" Vieira says. ""And I think it's important for you to get focused on your objective, focused on what you want to achieve as a team."" Luck . Having all these ingredients is no guarantee for success, however, as at a major international tournament the winning team often needs a little luck along the way. Ghana found this out the hard way after a run to the last eight of the 2010 World Cup that captured the imagination of much of Africa -- but was brought to an end in the most controversial of circumstances. With the Black Stars' quarterfinal clash against Uruguay destined for penalties with the scores tied at 1-1 and just seconds remaining, Dominic Adiyiah saw his goal-bound header cleared off the line by Luis Suarez's hand. Suarez was sent off for his actions -- and widely condemned by the world of football afterwards -- but the damage had already been done as Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting spot-kick, before Uruguay went on to win the ensuing penalty shootout. Luck was not on the side of Algeria in 1982, either. With the Desert Warriors having already played their final group game, West Germany knew that a one- or two-goal win over Austria would take the neighboring nations through to the second round at the expense of the debutant team. After 10 minutes, West Germany took the lead, before the two teams proceeded to kick the ball around aimlessly for the rest of the match. ""You need luck, because you will not win the best competition if you do not have luck. But the luck, you have to provoke it to make it happen,"" says Vieira. ""I think when you look at all the African teams who are playing in the World Cup, they lack one of the five ingredients (quality, togetherness, discipline, focus or luck). ""So hopefully they will have built it all up in the last few weeks so they will get to the first game where the togetherness, the quality of the players, the focus, and of course the luck at the end (is all there), because luck is very important.""","Patrick Vieira believes an African nation will one day win the World Cup .

"(CNN) -- That ""miracle"" weight-loss product you've seen on TV may not live up to the hype. The Federal Trade Commission has charged four companies with deceptive advertising related to their weight loss products. ""Operation Failed Resolution,"" as the FTC calls it, is an effort by the federal agency to crack down on companies' misleading claims about products that allegedly help consumers slim down. ""Resolutions to lose weight are easy to make but hard to keep,"" Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. ""And the chances of being successful just by sprinkling something on your food, rubbing cream on your thighs or using a supplement are slim to none. The science just isn't there."" Only three weight-loss drugs are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for long-term use by certain adults: Belviq, Qsymia and Orlistat (sold over-the-counter as Alli). The FTC has reached a settlement with Sensa, Inc. and a partial settlement with LeanSpa, LLC., according to an FTC press release. The release also announced the charges filed against L'Occitane and HCG Diet Direct. Users sprinkle Sensa on their food to allegedly reduce hunger. It contains maltodextrin, tricalcium phosphate and silica, as well as natural and artificial flavors. Sensa's advertising claimed the product is clinically proven to help people lose an average of 30 pounds in six months without dieting or exercise. ""Simply sprinkle Sensa on, eat all the foods you love and watch the pounds come off,"" one commercial promised. ""It's that easy."" A one-month supply of Sensa is $59.00 (plus shipping and handling). Profit from the sales of Sensa in the United States between 2008 and 2012 totaled nearly $364 million, according to court documents. The FTC complaint named Sensa Products LLC, Sensa Inc., Sensa CEO Adam Goldberg and Sensa creator Dr. Alan Hirsch. All were charged with making unsubstantiated claims. ""SENSAÃÂ® made a business decision to settle with the FTC so it could focus on the core of its business: its customers,"" the company said in response on its website. ""The settlement includes no admission of wrongful conduct by the company... The company has agreed to make changes to its advertising claims but otherwise will continue business as usual."" The FTC shut down LeanSpa leader Boris Mizhen's weight-loss companies in December 2011, claiming they were using fake news websites to promote acai berry and colon cleansing products. The FTC said consumers were being ripped off by paying up to $79.99 in shipping and handling charges for a ""free trial."" In a statement, LeanSpa said that it ""regrets that it was forced by heavy-handed government tactics and financial circumstances, including an unwarranted freeze of the personal assets of LeanSpa principal Boris Mizhen and his wife (who wasn't even involved in the business and has been accused of no wrongdoing), to enter into this settlement. LeanSpa never should have been named in this lawsuit and has been ruined by it. ""LeanSpa was an excellent company with first rank scientific advisors and an excellent, clinically tested weight loss product. It did not mislead consumers in its product claims or billing practices, and was itself a victim of deceptive and fraudulent conduct by its marketing partners. The settlement is a pragmatic compromise which admits no wrongdoing by LeanSpa and Mr. Mizhen and spares them expensive, protracted litigation. Could they have had their day in court, they are confident they and their actions would have been wholly vindicated."" The company's website, LeanSpa.com, appeared to be down Wednesday. L'Occitane sells beauty products and fragrances that are ""inspired by the Mediterranean lifestyle,"" according to the company's website. L'Occitane launched an advertising campaign in 2012 that claimed its Almond Beautiful Shape and Almond Shaping Delight skin creams could help consumers slim down. Commercials said Almond Beautiful Shape could ""trim 1.3 inches in just 4 weeks"" while Almond Shaping Delight would ""visibly refine and reshape the silhouette."" Seven ounces of the products sold for $48 and $44, respectively. ""L'Occitane takes enormous care in developing our entire line of products and we want our customers to make well-informed decisions,"" the company said in a statement. ""When the FTC raised concerns in April 2012 regarding the way research findings for Almond Beautiful Shape and Almond Shaping Delight were communicated, we immediately took steps to review our advertising and marketing processes, and cooperated fully with the FTC. As a result of the FTC inquiry, L'Occitane has implemented a set of even more rigorous policies and procedures that will guide future clinical testing and ensure that our marketing and advertising comply with FTC regulations and guidelines."" HCG Diet Direct sells a liquid form of the hormone chorionic gonadotropin, which is produced by the human placenta and has long been said to promote weight loss. HGC products are sold online and in stores as pellets, sprays or oral drops, and are supposed to be taken with a very-low calorie diet of less than 800 calories per day. In November 2011, HCG Diet Direct and six other companies received warning letters from the FTC and the FDA. ""These HCG products marketed over-the-counter are unproven to help with weight loss and are potentially dangerous even if taken as directed,"" said Ilisa Bernstein, acting director of the Office of Compliance in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, at the time. ""A very low-calorie diet should only be used under proper medical supervision."" The company falsely claimed the drops were approved by the FDA and charged approximately $35 for a seven-day supply, according to the FTC. It had sales totaling $3 million between 2009 and 2012. Executives from HCG Diet Direct did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Three of the four companies charged owe money to reimburse customers, according to the FTC: Sensa will pay $26.5 million; L'Occitane, Inc. will pay $450,000; and LeanSpa will surrender ""cash, real estate and personal property"" totaling $7.3 million. HCG Diet Direct has submitted financial statements to the FTC saying it is unable to pay the $3.2 million judgment; the fee has been suspended. The companies and defendants named in the legal charges are barred from making any other weight-loss claims about dietary supplements, food or drugs unless they have reliable scientific evidence, according to the FTC. Americans spend billions of dollars every year on supplements. The industry reported an estimated $25 billion in sales in 2009. ""Market analysts suggest that the downturn in the economy has led to increased spending on these products, as consumers attempt to manage their own health care and avoid expensive doctor visits and prescription medications,"" the FTC said on its website.","FTC says it has settled with Sensa, LeanSpa .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- The Colombian president has dismissed as ""media spectacle"" a decision by Colombian rebels to release an American captive to civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson said Sunday that FARC rebel leaders have agreed to release U.S. Army veteran Kevin Scott Sutay. ""They have released him already,"" he said. ""But we must go to get him. He's in Colombia in the jungle. That involves the permission of the government of Colombia and the Red Cross and the facilitating our going into the jungle. Because it's a war zone and there needs to be a cease-fire."" FARC guerrillas captured Sutay on June 20 while he was backpacking through Colombia. Saturday, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos tweeted, ""Only the Red Cross will be authorized to facilitate the delivery of the North American kidnapped by FARC. We will not allow a media spectacle."" A statement on the presidential website went further: ""They need now all kinds of media shows to free a detained person after they promised they would never kidnap anyone."" Colombian officials previously said they feared FARC would use Sutay's release to garner media coverage. 'A humanitarian gesture' Jackson said FARC invited him to Havana, where the group has been holding peace talks with the Colombian government since last October. ""It's a humanitarian gesture of their own volition, demanding nothing in return,"" Jackson said at a news conference in the Cuban capital Saturday. ""I consider it as a gesture to reinforce the peace negotiation."" FARC guerrillas said in a statement they had previously offered to free Sutay but that ""the Colombian government did not provide the minimum necessary conditions we need for this procedure."" The presidential website statement said that if the rebels are indeed acting in good faith, ""they should release him quickly without any strings attached."" The U.S. State Department said it was aware that Jackson had ""expressed a willingness to assist"" and that it was in close contact with the Colombian government. 'He is a tourist' Jackson said he hopes the Red Cross in Colombia will provide a helicopter to remove Sutay from the remote area of the country where he is being held and that the Colombian government will designate the area a cease-fire zone during his release. Despite the 10-month old peace talks, the Colombian government has resisted calls for a cease-fire with guerrillas, saying the rebels have used previous cease-fires to strengthen their forces. Sutay served in the U.S. Army from November 2009 to March 2013. He served in Afghanistan for a year starting in November 2010, according to the U.S. Defense Department. He is from Willow Spring, North Carolina, and won a number of awards, including an Army Commendation Medal and a National Defense Service Medal. The Pentagon lists his rank as private. Despite Sutay's military background, Jackson said the Army veteran had peaceful motives for visiting Colombia. ""The fact is, he is a tourist,"" Jackson said. FARC, whose name in Spanish is the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, began fighting the government in the 1960s, making it Latin America's oldest guerrilla force. There have been sporadic peace talks between the rebels and the government since the 1980s. The last attempt failed in 2002.

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- A great deal has been said about the five week long election underway in India. The world's largest democracy. 814 million people going to the polls. A candidate representing a family dynasty versus a firebrand chief minister. But this race will likely boil down to three simple numbers that impact every citizen in the country: growth, inflation and interest rates. To be blunt, they do not favor the incumbent Congress party which has ruled for the last decade. What's at stake? Economic growth came in at only 4.5% in the last fiscal year, the worst performance in a decade. We are awaiting the final tally for last year, but bets are it will be below 5%. Consumer inflation for February came in at a 25-month low of 8.1%, but that is incredibly high when the rest of the world is trying to fight off deflation, not the rising cost of food. With prices soaring over the past year, the relatively new but high profile central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan was forced to raise interest rates three times since last September. The repo rate for the Reserve Bank of India stood at 8% as Indians began their journey to the polls. Whether it is on the campaign trail in the U.S., Europe or Asia, pocketbook issues dominate. By the numbers: The world's biggest exercise in democracy . It is widely viewed in the Indian business community that the competent, but aging Prime Minister Manmohan Singh lost his zeal for reform and that Rahul Gandhi committed too late in the game to express a desire to lead in a party which has run out of ideas to jumpstart growth. Prior to the global banking crisis India was humming along, with growth of over 9% for a handful of years. You probably remember when comparisons were being made about the two towers of the emerging markets, China and India. A state-run apparatus stacked up against the sprawling democratic structure of India, with chief ministers of states controlling so much power. In the Congress party era, names like Tata and Infosys came to the fore. We understood the vibrancy and productivity of Bollywood. And we are well aware of the rising middle class in India. But this is an election where one should keep an eye two core voting blocks: the youth and those in the vast rural lands. 11 things to know about the world's biggest election . India is a young country. Nearly half are under the age of 26. Despite the wealth creation in the past decade, about 850 million Indians live outside major cities and remain dependent on farming. According to a poll by Pew Research ahead of the vote, both these blocks favor the BJP party by a margin of 3 to 1. They think Chief Minister Narenda Modi is better positioned to cut bureaucracy, tackle corruption and revive growth. They were probably were led to that position by the three numbers that have clearly undermined support for the Congress party. More from John Defterios: Why the world is watching the Fragile Five .

"(CNN) -- Nigeria woke up on Sunday to a brand new economy, apparently. The federal government had changed the baseline for calculating Gross Domestic Product for the first time since 1990, and as a result the economy was boosted by around 75%. This was thanks, in part, to the contributions of accelerated sectors like telecoms and entertainment. Overnight, the economy of the ""giant of Africa"" had grown from $292 billion to $510 billion. It could now claim to be Africa's largest economy, and the world's 26th. It was another headline-grabbing moment for a government already smug from Nigeria's status as one of the ""MINT"" economies, which also includes Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey. They are seen as successors to the now-famous BRICs as profiled by former Goldman Sachs economist, Jim O'Neill. But more interesting than this news is the countrywide response. In summary, it was a loud hiss. To hear one columnist tell it, ""until Iya Ramota, the tomato seller at Mile 12 Market, can be guaranteed uninterrupted power supply... any economic statistic indicating that Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa ... cannot be worth more than the paper it is written on!"" To be sure, this is not a particularly bright argument. No country is changed overnight. After all, statistics matter. To dismiss a decade of annual growth averaging 7% in real terms is to insist on ignorance about how nations are changed in the long term. And, in terms of how the world views our country with respect to investment and risk, this news cannot hurt. But the argument against has some merit. There are some urgent numbers that, alas, wont go away. Despite our new status, South Africa's GDP per capita is $7,352 compared to our $1,555, according to 2012 statistics. South Africa produces 40,000 megawatts, set to double by 2025, while we battle a miserly 3,000 with no prospects of improvement, if our immediate history is any guide. Barely a week ago, in a nod to the over 100 million living far under the poverty line, the World Bank president said Nigeria was one of the world's poorest countries. Then there is our biggest and most urgent crisis -- a debilitating lack of jobs. The National Bureau of Statistics has youth unemployment at over 54%, although some commentators insist the true number is almost 80%. Our work with Aiki.ng, a portal to expand access to jobs and opportunities for young people, suggest they are closer to the truth. If anyone disagrees with the numbers, they must accept the visual aids. In February, Nigerians were hit with the harrowing image from the nation's capital, Abuja. At least half a million youth fought for 4,500 positions available in the Nigerian Immigration Service, with tens of thousands gathering at the National Stadium. Amid the crush, 16 people died. In Northern Nigeria, hundreds continue to die as the vestiges of state control have completely broken down, in a war that terrorist organization Boko Haram is clearly winning. How much direct foreign investment can our brand-new economy truly bring if Nigeria is still defined by insecurity, rampant inequality and a government that suspends its central bank governor, after he warns of missing oil revenues? Not much, Nigerians believe. And they have saying this loudly for months and years. There was a time when the president's people would dismiss the naysayers as a vocal minority on social media. But this has changed. According to the NOI-Gallup Polls -- the country's most credible barometer -- Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's approval ratings for March took a 10-point hit, continuing a trend from last year that makes it clear he is no longer a popular president. That is why numbers that should give a psychological boost to a battle-weary citizenry instead lead to scorn, to disbelief, to nationwide derision. Because people are tired of pointless numbers and meaningless chest thumping. Nigerians are tired of waiting for their leaders to lead. Last week, the International Youth Foundation released its first Global Youth Wellbeing Index. Nigeria youth ranked lowest for wellbeing. The country was ranked near bottom in terms of economic opportunities, near bottom in use of Information Technology. Nigeria's education system -- as seen by young people aged 12 -- 24 - is ranked the worst in the world. Much can fall apart, but when your youth lose faith in the present, and are incapable of seeing hope in the future, that is the worst possible thing that could happen to any country in the world. That's not so easy to rebase. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chude Jideonwo.","Nigeria's economy was ""rebased,"" making it Africa's largest and the world's 26th.

"(CNN) -- The number of states reporting widespread seasonal flu activity jumped from 10 to 25 last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Widespread activity was reported in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington state and Wyoming, according to the CDC's weekly flu advisory report, covering the week ending December 28. ""Widespread"" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. It addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity. However, 20 states experienced a high proportion of outpatient visits to health care providers for flu-like illnesses. The most severe activity seems to be located in the Southeastern states. So far, ""it's a typical influenza season, if I can use that word,"" Dr. Michael Jhung, a medical officer in the CDC's flu division, told CNN last week. The season usually begins in the winter months and peaks in January or February. The only atypical thing seen this year is that the most common strain has been H1N1, which became known as swine flu during a 2009 outbreak. ""It's the same virus that we saw in 2009 that caused the pandemic,"" Jhung said. At the time, it was called swine flu since it was seen for the first time in humans. But since then, ""it's established itself very nicely in the human population,"" Jhung said. ""We've seen it every season since 2009 in people."" The virus is no longer referred to as swine flu, but instead as a human seasonal virus. The strain is so common that it was included in this year's vaccination, he said. 5 ways to combat flu in your home . Two new pediatric flu deaths were reported to the CDC last week, according to the report. One was associated with the H1N1 virus; another was associated with an influenza A strain. Six pediatric flu deaths have been reported since September 29, according to the CDC. The agency does not track adult deaths related to the flu, although some states do, and deaths have been reported. The exact number of flu-related adult deaths is hard to track and varies from year to year. The CDC has estimated that from 1976 through 2007, between 3,000 and 49,000 people died of flu-related causes. ""It depends on the season; it depends on the virus,"" Jhung said. Last year, 381,000 people were hospitalized and 171 children died in what's being called a relatively severe season. However, the CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented 6.6 million illnesses last year, 3.2 million doctor visits and at least 79,000 hospitalizations. Flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older, especially pregnant women and those at high risk of complications, including the elderly, children younger than 5 years and those with underlying medical conditions such as asthma or diabetes. Antiviral medications are a good treatment if you do get sick, Jhung said, particularly those at high risk for complications. Ideally, antivirals should be started within two days of when symptoms appear. CNN's Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","25 states are reporting widespread seasonal flu activity, the CDC says .
The cases appear to be those of a typical season .

"(CNN) -- A computer virus campaign is targeting opponents of Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin, according to anti-virus software maker Symantec. ""A wave of spam e-mails promoting a rally"" against the newly elected president is delivering the spyware as an attachment that appears to be a Word document. In reality, the file is a software program known as ""Trojan.Dropper."" The spam e-mails began circulating sometime around March 5, according to an entry Wednesday on Symantec's official blog. The subject lines in the e-mails call demonstrators to action with phrases like: ""all to demonstration,"" ""instructions what to do,"" or ""meeting for the equal elections."" The body of the e-mail pushes the recipient to open an attachment, purporting that it contains need-to-know information. When the user opens the file, a document does actually open revealing an announcement for a supposed anti-Putin rally with a map indicating its apparent location. But at the same time, the file drops a Trojan horse virus onto the unwitting user's computer. Once on the computer, the virus overwrites many of the user's files then deletes them thoroughly. ""The Trojan also attempts to connect to IP address 193.104.153.31 (down at the time of analysis),"" Symantec says. This server address is located in Switzerland, but it is associated with another ""notorious"" virus that once operated off of a Web address with a Russian domain name. At the end of its virulent rampage, the malware crashes the victim's computer, causing it to blue-screen. Symantec characterizes the spam attack as ""unusual -- mainly because of its size."" These messages average 500 KB in size -- 50 times the usual size of junk e-mails. ""Most spam messages do not exceed 10 KB,"" the IT security company points out. Antivirus software has been adjusted to recognize the malware, but Symantec warns on its blog: ""As always, be aware of any unsolicited e-mails containing attachments, which might take advantage of current events like the recent election result in Russia.""","Spam e-mails promoting a rally against President-elect Putin contain spyware .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The American commandos who died when their helicopter crashed in eastern Afghanistan were targeting a Taliban commander directly responsible for attacks on U.S. troops, military officials with knowledge of the operation said Sunday. The crash killed 30 U.S. service members, the Afghan war's worst single-day American toll. Among the dead were 22 Navy SEALs who were being flown in to assist an Army Rangers unit pinned down by enemy fire in restive Wardak province early Saturday morning. The current whereabouts of the Taliban leader targeted in the raid were unclear, said the military officials, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of ongoing operations in the crash area. One civilian translator and seven Afghan commandos were also killed in the crash, officials said. NATO troops were still combing through the wreckage of the downed helicopter on Sunday, said Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. ""They're just trying to recover everything from the crash at this point,"" Cummings said. Elsewhere, four other NATO soldiers were killed in separate insurgent attacks on Sunday. Two were killed in the country's volatile east, while another two service members died in southern Afghanistan, NATO reported. Their deaths add to a heavy blow against American military operations in the region just as NATO troops are drawing down and a handover to Afghan security forces is under way. The majority of the SEALs -- considered to be among America's most elite warriors -- belonged to the same covert unit that conducted the May raid that killed Osama bin Laden, though they were not the same men, a U.S. military official said. The Taliban has taken responsibility for the attack, claiming to have downed the helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade. Provincial council head Mohammad Hazrat Janan also said insurgents used a rocket-propelled grenade in the attack, though the actual type of weapon is still unclear. While military officials in Afghanistan have not confirmed that an attack brought down the helicopter, they have acknowledged it was operating in an area rife with insurgent activity. Afghan officials say the craft crashed in Wardak's Tangi Valley, a corridor located roughly 60 miles southwest of the Afghan capital and situated amid mountainous and rocky terrain. Tangi village elders reported that insurgents shot at the craft when it was returning from an operation that left eight insurgents dead, according to Janan. NATO declined to comment on the details of the operation or the circumstances of the crash. The specifics of the incident were first made public by way of a written statement from Afghan President Hamid Karzai. ""It was amazing to me that the first details came from the presidential palace,"" said Baktash Siawash, a parliament member from Kabul. ""At the same time, we didn't hear anything from NATO."" Siawash said Karzai's swift release of the crash details amounted to helping the Taliban quickly claim responsibility for the incident. The Afghan president has come under increasing criticism by anti-Taliban lawmakers over his willingness to negotiate with insurgent leadership. He has traditionally said he is trying to bring an end to the near decadelong conflict. A presidential spokesman dismissed Siawash's allegations as ""nonsense,"" saying Karzai's initial statement on the crash was meant to express condolences over the loss of American life. Meanwhile, Karzai called a security meeting of his top advisers Sunday to discuss the incident, according to a statement from his office. He spoke to U.S. President Barack Obama, who ""noted the extraordinary service of the Americans who gave their lives, and expressed his condolences for the Afghans who died serving by their side,"" according to the White House. Obama also placed calls to Gen. John R. Allen, International Security Assistance Force commander, and Gen. Joseph Votel, head of the Joint Special Operations Command, in Afghanistan. Reflecting on the sobering loss, Obama said the deaths were ""a reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and women of our military and their families, including all who have served in Afghanistan."" Among those killed was Aaron Carson Vaughn, 30, his grandmother told CNN Saturday night. She called him a brave warrior and gentle man. Geneva Carson Vaughn of Union City, Tennessee, said Aaron lived with his wife and two small children in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The SEAL told her in June not to worry about his well-being, she said. ""He said, 'I'm not afraid. Because I know where I am going if something happens to me,' "" Vaughn recounted. ""He is with the Lord now,"" she added. ""I will see him again someday."" Saturday's fatalities came as about 10,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to depart by year's end, with the full drawdown expected to take place by the end of 2014. Ryan Crocker, the newly minted U.S. ambassador in Kabul, has pledged that no permanent U.S. bases would remain inside the war-torn country -- but he also has suggested that American military commitments to Afghanistan could extend beyond the draw-down date. Saturday's incident has also raised concerns among Kabul lawmakers over the perceived strength of the insurgency. ""This shows the Taliban are now more mobilized than before,"" said Khalid Pashton, a parliament member from Kandahar province, the traditional heartland of the Taliban. ""Now there is an organized play in Afghanistan that seems (to suggest) that U.S. forces will soon leave."" Meanwhile, officials are being especially tight-lipped because recovery operations -- which began immediately following the crash -- are still under way and body identifications and family notifications are just beginning, a U.S. military official said. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul said ISAF ""is still assessing the circumstances that resulted in these deaths."" Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi said it's too early to say if the Taliban caused the crash. He called for an investigation. ""Information is still coming in about this incident. I think it's important that we allow investigators to do their work before jumping to too many conclusions,"" said Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""It's also important that we respect the process of notifying family members, no matter how long that takes."" There are 150,000 ISAF troops in Afghanistan, including just under 100,000 from the United States -- the largest NATO presence in the region since the U.S.-led war began in 2001. David Ariosto reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Barbara Starr and Steve Brusk reported from Washington.","The Navy SEALs were aiding trapped members of the 75th Army Ranger regiment .

"Tacloban City, The Philippines (CNN) -- The day after the typhoon, Father Edwin Bacaltos stepped out of the compound of the Church of Our Mother of Perpetual Help in central Tacloban and began his work. The scene was one of unspeakable horror. Dead bodies were strewn all over the place. The debris of shattered buildings and their contents filled the street. Father Bacaltos' self-appointed task that day was to bless the bodies that lay scattered around his parish. He crossed the road to the hospital opposite the church compound, tending to each of the corpses in its grounds. He then moved onto other areas that weren't blocked off by walls of wreckage. His day of work took a heavy mental toll. ""It was difficult for me,"" he said. ""It was a really emotional experience."" The next day, he said, ""When I celebrated the Eucharist, I broke down because of all the suffering I had seen."" Hundreds of survivors were taking refuge in the church compound, much of which withstood Super Typhoon Haiyan's ferocious winds and destructive storm surge. Many of them asked the pastor how God could let such a calamity befall this predominantly Catholic city. His response, he said, was to tell them that ""God is not the cause of the suffering. God cannot prevent this. This is the work of nature."" But why it had to happen to Tacloban and its more than 200,000 residents, Father Bacaltos acknowledged, is ""difficult to explain."" As the people who remain in this broken city attempt to come to terms with the catastrophe that engulfed them a week ago, religion is offering a degree of solace for some of those who have suffered incalculable losses. It's also providing basic elements of community and support to residents of an area where local government ceased to fully function for several days and is still only slowly sputtering back into action. In Santo Nino Church -- situated a few blocks north of Father Bacaltos' compound -- Joan Norcio, 26, sat on one of the wooden pews near the back, waiting for Mass to begin. Her home has been destroyed, she said, and three members of her family are still missing. She's received no food from authorities, relying on the charity of her neighbors instead. Attending Mass at Santo Nino has been ""a big help"" during this time, she said, sitting solemnly next to a motherly neighbor and the neighbor's young son. The storm ripped off most of the roof of the church. A large pool of dirty water sits in the center of the floor. And the adoration chapel is filled with brown sludge and broken chairs. But the altar is still largely intact. Masses resumed the day after the typhoon and are now being held two or three times a day, said Father Isagani Petilos, one of the two senior pastors at the church. Father Petilos, who also blessed the bodies in the area surrounding his church soon after the storm, said he didn't know if religion was helping the survivors endure the aftermath. ""Only God knows,"" he said. ""Only these people know. We are all victims. There are whole families lost."" He and his colleagues have encouraged people to write the names of those killed in the storm on a board, so that they can be included in the congregation's prayers. Norcio said she has made use of another board at the back of the church where people can put details about missing loved ones in the hope that others who might know of their whereabouts can alert them. Sitting a few rows farther forward, Arsenia Orioque, 74, had come to the church to pray and to take advantage of the medical services being offered there each afternoon. Since the storm washed out her home and mini-grocery store, she has developed a bad cough, she said. All her clothes were ruined, leaving her to wear a red t-shirt that a neighbor took for her from a nearby shopping mall during the looting in the typhoon's aftermath. She seldom came to church before the storm struck, but now she says she can find peace there. ""In my prayers, I give thanks that I survived the typhoon,"" she said. In the Philippines, more than 80% of the population describes itself as Roman Catholic, and only a tiny fraction of those surveyed in the national census say they have no religion at all. Many of Tacloban residents feel close to the nation's Catholic history. In 1521, the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan landed on Honmonhon Island, which sits on the Gulf of Leyte not far from Tacloban. Though he was eventually killed in a fight on another Philippine island, his arrival marked the beginning of the conversion of most of the archipelago to Catholicism. The missionary spirit is alive and well in Father Bacaltos' chuch. It has provided food and shelter to more than 300 families since the storm, he said. Inside the church, children played in the aisle and pieces of meat were cooking in a pan on a small fire. Sitting shirtless on one pew with a cigarette in his mouth, Eddie Cinco disagreed with the pastor's view of the cause of the storm. ""It was an act of God,"" he said, a silver crucifix hanging from his neck and a wound gradually healing on his right arm. ""Only God is strong enough to do this."" Rubbing one of his bare feet, he said that God had perhaps decided to punish Tacloban, but he couldn't think why. Cinco said that he was thankful that he and his six family members staying in the church had been spared, even if their home had been flattened. In his prayers, he said, he asks for no more calamities. The churches are doing their best to help the living, but the dead are not being afforded a great deal of dignity - despite the pastors' initial efforts. Corpses have lined the streets here for days, festering in plain view. Many of them are now encased in body bags, and workers are gradually collecting them and moving them to an outdoor morgue. In front of the Church of Our Mother of Perpetual Help on Friday, a row of body bags was being hauled onto the back of a truck. Last in line was a rudimentary coffin with a wooden cross leaning against it. Determining that the coffin wouldn't fit on the truck, the workers picked up the wooden cross and used it to smash open the lid. They pulled out the decaying bodies of a young woman and an older man, loosely wrapped in plastic, and deposited them on the road. In front of a growing crowd, many of whom covered their noses with their hands or shirts, the workers placed the corpses in body bags and added them to the pile on the truck. On the outskirts of town, bodies that hadn't been claimed by relatives who had to examine corpse after corpse at the morgue near the city hall were being lumped into mass graves. There was no sign of religious rites at the proceedings. But Mayor Alfred Romualdez said a priest would conduct a ceremony at the mass graves, once the national authorities had given their approval. Such grim scenes remain harrowingly abundant in and around Tacloban. But Father Petilos urged people not to focus only on the misery. ""Even if we have this kind of situation, there is still hope,"" he said, noting that some families in the city had begun the long, slow process of rebuilding their lives. ""Yes, we may have been damaged,"" he said. ""Devastated. But we're not dead."" BELIEF BLOG: Jesus statue unscathed by Typhoon Haiyan . Are you there?

"Paris, France (CNN) -- It's been a life filled with the highest of highs, and the lowest of lows for tennis great Martina Navratilova. ""I think anybody that survives the communist system, they're pretty tough!"" Navratilova told CNN. ""And then being gay on top of that, that wasn't helpful. As they say, that which does not kill you makes you stronger, so I am pretty strong."" This year she needed all the strength gained from her amazing life to fight breast cancer while continuing to play tennis and commentate. CNN International was granted rare access to document Navratilova's treatment. She decided to tell her story because she wants women to take better care of themselves and get regular mammograms -- not put it off like she had. ""I heard on February 24, which is kind of my 9/11. You don't forget the day when your life is completely changed forever. Although I did not hear the word cancer, your biopsies (are) positive. I am like 'positive is usually good, wait a minute, that is not good, what does it mean?'"" Navratilova said. She was diagnosed with the most common type of non-invasive breast cancer: ductal carcinoma in situ, or D.C.I.S. In Navratilova's case, the news was encouraging because the cancer was isolated and had not spread to surrounding tissue. Navratilova underwent a successful lumpectomy to remove the cancerous cells on March 15. She said: ""I didn't need to have chemo. The surgery was minor. I was out of the hospital that day so nothing to really knock me on my butt and really suffer from, so I was fortunate that I got the kind of cancer that you can control this way."" In true Navratilova fashion, she wasted little time. Less than two weeks after the surgery, she competed in the 24.9-mile cycling portion of a triathlon in Waikoloa, Hawaii. Tennis legend Billie Jean King wasn't surprised by Navratilova's approach. ""She didn't miss a beat. That's very Martina. She doesn't sit around wondering or fidgeting. She just gets into action. She's a woman of action. The way she played was that way and that's how she lives her life. I mean, she's still incredibly so fit in so many ways."" A couple of weeks after the triathlon Navratilova played an exhibition tennis match against Lindsay Davenport in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Davenport was impressed with how Navratilova coped with her diagnosis. ""She will beat this, if anyone can beat this she can, she is strong. It did strike me as odd that someone so physically fit who takes such pride in her health, in her eating, and all aspects of her life, was just amazing that you realize cancer can reach anybody. ""Martina is handling it so well and being such a leader about it and hopefully, obviously inspiring other women to continue to be checked, because if it can happen to Martina, it can happen to anybody."" The second part of Navratilova's cancer treatment was radiation. She began her treatment on May 12 at L'Institut Curie in Paris, France. Her doctor, Alain Fourquet, said: ""We know that if we just do the surgery and nothing more there is a significant risk ... and by doing the whole breast radiotherapy we're able to importantly and significantly decrease the rate of recurrence, which becomes very low after that kind of treatment."" Navratilova underwent radiation treatments at least four times a week over the course of six weeks. At first, she didn't notice much change. ""It's very individual, I'm feeling nothing. It's weird you lay on the table and the treatment only lasts three or four minutes you know, they organize you... I'm marked on my breast where the radiation goes so that you're positioned just right on the table,"" she said. One of the reasons Navratilova wanted to undergo treatment in Paris was her commitment to the French Open. She was scheduled to commentate for the Tennis Channel and also compete in the legends doubles tournament with 1998 Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna. Weeks three and four of her treatment coincided with the tournament. Navratilova would start her day at the hospital, commentate in the afternoons, and then play tennis in the evenings. She said: ""I can work during the French Open and I'll be finished just before Wimbledon, so it's like you know, lucky me, it all worked out. It's like the gods were saying everything's not perfect for you but we're still giving you a break because I have a non-invasive form of cancer and the way the treatment worked out I was able to stay with my life, with the way I had planned it."" As the French Open was ending though, Navratilova found herself at the low point of the treatment. ""I'm getting a little sore and getting a little run down. I go upstairs, I take the steps, two stories, and I'm getting a little more tired when I get to the top these days. Not bad... but overall, yeah just a little sore, sort of like a pressure on your breast, like somebody puts you in sort of a grip and doesn't let go, it's not horrible yet, we'll see."" Despite not feeling 100 percent, Navratilova competed in the French Open legends final on June 5 and won convincingly. She raised the trophy with Novotna by her side. Navratilova was ready for a break then. She wanted time to herself, out of the limelight to complete her remaining two weeks of radiation. The CNN team returned on the day of her final treatment and Navratilova was more than ready to be done with this chapter of her cancer treatment. On June 16, Navratilova pulled up to the hospital -- like she had done more than two dozen times before -- but this time Novotna was with her. ""I said to Martina many times I am really grateful that I have this opportunity during this difficult time to spend this time with you, not only off the court, but also on the court and be part of something that is very special,"" Novotna said. When the pair walked out the hospital later that day, Navratilova had the biggest smile on her face, she did a little dance, and then she tried to slide down the banister. ""Last day! Last day! Hallelujah! We're going to have a little party tonight to celebrate. It's a different kind of celebration, but a celebration nonetheless and it was like saying to the (machine): 'F*** you, I'm out of here! Never again. I'm never going to see you again. Done, finished.'"" When asked if this was a time of forward thinking or reflection, Navratilova said: ""I'll think about it, but I'm just thankful that I caught it when I did, that I didn't wait another year and think, ""Oh I'll just do that mammogram later"" ... I'll be very meticulous now about going to the doctor and getting those six month check ups and one year check ups. I'm not going to let that lapse again."" Just two days later, Navratilova was on the move again -- to Wimbledon. It's the tournament were she won a record nine singles titles. She was again providing analysis for the Tennis Channel and competing with Novotna for another legends crown. By then, Navratilova had started to feel like herself again. She said: ""You know because it was so gradual, I didn't realize how flat I was. I knew I didn't feel like myself but today I feel like I hit up in another higher plateau. The skin is pretty sensitive on my breast but one place, the rest is pretty good, but I didn't realize that emotionally I was just so flat, you know, because it happens so gradually."" During Wimbledon, Navratilova started feeling strong again. She was able to balance countless interview requests, appearances, Tennis Channel work -- and most importantly her time on the court. Novotna said: ""She needs tennis to feel good. Tennis means everything to her and I asked her: 'Martina, do you think you'll be playing tennis when you're 90 or 100?' She said, for sure. I said, 'Well, if you're still playing at 100, I want to play with you."" Novotna and Navratilova won all three of their matches to reach the final and needed only two sets to win the Wimbledon legends title. They treated their fans to a special victory lap around the edges of court 1 -- each with one hand on the championship trophy. Navratilova said: ""Now I am happy that I sort of get to rest and take care of myself. I haven't really had a chance to cry. Ever since I was diagnosed it's been pretty much non-stop, so I'm glad to have some time in July and August to myself and really reset the clock and re-evaluate everything.""","Martina Navratilova tells inside story of beating breast cancer .

"(CNN) -- Iran has been targeted by a new computer worm named Stars, according to an Iranian official. ""The damage is very slight in the initial stage,"" defense official Gholam Reza Jalali told the semi-official news agency Mehr. It was unclear how long ago the worm was discovered or which systems in Iran it was designed to penetrate. ""It is compatible with the (targeted) system,"" Jalali said, and ""it is likely to be mistaken for executable files of the government."" The announcement comes less than a year after Iranian nuclear facilities were targeted by a highly specialized computer worm called Stuxnet. It was apparently designed to secretly infiltrate the centrifuge machines that refine uranium and make them spin so fast they would break, according to David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security. ""About 10% of the centrifuges were destroyed by Stuxnet,"" he said, which resulted in a setback for the Iranian nuclear program by as much as a year. Iranian officials have said they believe last year's Stuxnet cyberattack originated in Israel and the United States, but officials from neither country have commented on the malware's origin. An American and an Israeli representative reached by CNN about the latest report again declined to comment. An official with Symantec, a computer security firm that decoded the Stuxnet program last year, said a sample would be required for the company to forensically study the latest program for clues to its origin and its target. ""Until we have that, we can only guess at this point,"" said John Harrison, with Symantec's security response group. An Iranian official at the United Nations, Alireza Miryousefi, said he could provide no further details on the latest attack. But in a statement, he said, ""These sabotages -- (such) as producing computer viruses and the assassination of our nuclear scientists -- are outright criminal and illegal, aimed at preventing Iranians from implementing their peaceful nuclear rights."" Last year, in addition to the computer worm attack, two Iranian nuclear scientists were attacked by unknown assailants with car bombs. One of them was killed. Albright warned that the latest cyberattack on Iran could prompt a response. ""Iran doesn't usually take things lying down,"" he said. ""I'm sure they will start thinking about retaliation. They'll probably think of trying to launch a cyberattack."" CNN's Brian Todd and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","The announcement comes less than a year after Iranian nuclear facilities were targeted .

"(CNN) -- At first glance a reality-TV hosting gig might seem beneath a megawatt star like Jennifer Lopez. But, according to insiders, Lopez needs ""American Idol"" just as much as it needs her. ""She's tried a couple comebacks. They really haven't worked for her,"" says Stuart Levine, managing editor at Variety. Levine added, ""She's not the celebrity she was 15 years ago. But she's not stupid. ... She's a smart businesswoman."" With a first look deal with Fox Films and a contract rumored to be worth $12 million , it looks like Jenny from the Block could be making out like a bandit. But neither party seems to be holding the short end of the stick. She's viewing ""Idol"" as a way to jump-start her film and TV career, Levine said. In turn,  Fox is banking on some star power to boost ratings during its first season without Simon Cowell. A first-look deal with Lopez means the studio will get the initial dibs on projects backed by her production company, Nuyorican Productions. According to Levine this isn't a big deal for Fox. "" 'Idol' is such a big money maker ... I don't think they had to twist too many arms for that,"" Levine said. ""Studios have so many first-look deals with so many production companies that one more is not a make or break situation. If this was someone they didn't want, they wouldn't have done it."" With last season's ratings dipping below 20 million viewers in April, J.Lo and Steven Tyler could be the magic formula for viewers. It's likely that ""Idol's"" audience share will soar at the beginning of the season, with viewers tuning in for the first few weeks to see the new judges in action. But then again, the same was said last season of recently resigned judge Ellen DeGeneres and everyone knows how that turned out, said Abbey Goodman, executive editor of RollingStone.com. ""No one thought Paula Abdul would be someone we would care about or miss when she was first announced,"" said Goodman. ""[Lopez] has the opportunity to get back that fan support through this. Whether she will remains to be seen."" In order to harness that support from fans, Lopez may need to return to her ""Jenny from the Block"" roots. Before there was ""American Idol,"" there was the ""Bennifer"" era, when Lopez engaged in a very public relationship with Ben Affleck. But before that, she was just a young girl growing up in New York trying to make it big. A dancer from the Bronx, Lopez landed a role as a Fly Girl on Fox's ""In Living Color"" in 1991. (J.Lo wasn't the only Fly Girl to become a judge on reality TV. Carrie Ann Inaba of ""Dancing With the Stars"" got her start on the comedy series in 1990.) iReport: Will you watch Lopez on ""Idol?"" After leaving the hit TV show in 1993, Lopez finally found a place in the music industry with her debut album, ""On the 6,"" in 1999. The album, which featured hits like ""If You Had My Love"" and ""Waiting for Tonight,"" earned the singer multiple Grammy Award nominations. J.Lo officially became a triple threat when she played the lead in the 1997 biopic ""Selena."" This breakout role led to other film opportunities, including 1998's acclaimed ""Out of Sight,"" in which she starred alongside George Clooney. She's since headlined romantic comedies like ""The Wedding Planner,"" ""Shall We Dance,"" ""Monster-in-Law"" and her most recent flick ""The Back-up Plan,"" which Levine jokes made about $12 at the box office. (According to BoxOfficeMoJo.com, the film made more than $12 million in its opening weekend.) For Lopez, who has two children with husband Marc Anthony, the benefits of her new gig don't end with a paycheck. On Wednesday, Lopez said she looks forward to settling down in Los Angeles for a while. ""This is a sweet deal,"" said James Cantiello, MTV News' ""American Idol"" expert. ""It's mutually beneficial for everyone involved."" This is the last season ""American Idol"" is guaranteed to be culturally relevant, Cantiello said. ""'Idol' lives and dies by the quality of the contestants,"" he added. ""As long as they cast good people this year, 'Idol' will remain on top.""","Fox has offered J.Lo a first look deal with Fox Films and a rumored $12 million salary .

"(CNN) -- A former member of Mexico's Tijuana Cartel was shot and killed in the popular Cabo tourist area, authorities said. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix was shot Friday night at a ""party venue"" at a beachfront hotel in Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California peninsula, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. The agency said authorities received some reports that the attack was carried out by two men, one of whom may have been dressed as a clown. Arellano Felix, 63, was killed by gunfire to the head, according to a statement by the deputy attorney's special investigations unit. Arellano Felix had served time in prisons in Mexico and the United States, Notimex said. He was released from an American prison in 2008 on a conviction for selling cocaine. Authorities said there were no pending criminal charges against him. The U.S. Justice Department has said the Tijuana Cartel, which was responsible for kidnappings and murders in addition to drug and gun offenses, was run by members of the Arellano Felix family. As of mid-2013, three members of the family were in American prisons. Another was killed in a shootout with police in 2002. State and military forces erected roadblocks in a search for the gunmen, but no arrests had been made Saturday night, Notimex reported. Police find stash of 213 grenades buried in El Salvador .

"(CNN) -- As Android devices get more popular (today comScore reports Android phones comprise 40% of the U.S. smartphone market), they're becoming a more attractive target for cybercriminals. If you use an Android smartphone, you are now 2.5 times more likely to encounter malware (malicious software) than you were six months ago. This isn't just about apps. This year, 30% of Android users are likely to encounter a Web-based threat such as phishing scams, ""drive by downloads"" and browser exploits. This is according to a new threat report from Lookout Mobile Security. Obviously, Lookout is selling mobile-security tools. However, individual and collective mobile security risks are real. Whether you opt to pay for mobile security, use a free service or manage it yourself, you should be aware of the risks and use basic mobile safety skills. Cybercriminals aren't simply targeting Android devices more often, they're also getting sneakier about it. Specifically, Lookout notes that attackers are using new techniques to distribute malware to phones. These include ""malvertising"" (ads served up through legitimate apps that lead you to a fake Android market and trick you into downloading malware, like GGtracker) and ""upgrade attacks"" (where the initially downloaded app is clean, but later upgrades deploy malware). How can mobile malware harm you? First of all, cybercriminals can rack up charges to your phone bill through ""carrier billing,"" a payment option that wireless carriers are increasingly pushing -- and which Google is starting to make possible for Android market app purchases. Malware also can sign you up for ""premium SMS"" text messaging services. Furthermore, mobile malware and spyware can pull sensitive data from your phone -- such as your credit card numbers, online banking or e-mail account login credentials or your contacts list. Infected phones also can become part of a ""botnet,"" which means your phone could be used without your knowledge as part of a larger attack scheme. This can also drive up your data traffic, which can push you toward your data plan's cap faster. Why is Android a bigger mobile security concern? It's an open platform, which presents significant pros and cons. On the bright side, Android's openness has made it easier for vendors to offer cheaper smartphones (especially without costly two-year contracts) to a much broader consumer market. On the downside, Android's openness also makes it especially susceptible to malware. Users of Apple and BlackBerry mobile devices are not immune to mobile security threats. But the closed nature of those platforms does make it harder for cybercriminals to infiltrate those devices with malware. However, threats such as e-mail phishing attempts and PDF exploits can put any mobile user at risk -- even on the iPhone. (Apple recently patched its latest PDF vulnerability, but future iOS risks are always a possibility.) Learn more about mobile security risks . John Hering, co-founder and CEO of Lookout, explains that a credulous user mindset has been a key factor in mobile security risks. ""We've observed that most mobile users are far more trusting about how they download and install software on their phone, compared to their computer,"" he said. ""But fortunately that's starting to change. Android users especially are starting to get more discerning."" However, the way people tend to use smartphones can also put them at risk. Hering noted that mobile users tend to be in distracting environments, so they generally provide only short bursts of divided attention to their phones. Kevin Mahaffey, Lookout's CTO and co-founder, explained that spotting malware on mobile devices is a bigger technical challenge than on computers. ""Personal computers have lots of power -- both energy and processing capacity -- so it's easy to run security analyses in that environment. If it were even possible to run the same types of analytics on a mobile phone, that would destroy battery and take two decades to build,"" Mahaffey said. ""So we had to consider, what if we could change the way malware detection is done? Instead of doing it on individual devices operating out in the world, what if we put it all on a big server and treat it as a data mining problem?"" This concept formed the genesis of Lookout's Mobile Threat Network, which provides mobile device security through an online platform that aggregates and constantly scans anonymized data gathered from over 700,000 mobile apps. One advantage of this approach is speed. Also, users don't have to remember to update Lookout security software; the system constantly updates itself. Mahaffey notes that if your phone is running an older version of the Android operating system, you face greater mobile security risks. On Android phones, OS updates get deployed via a variety of manufacturers and wireless carriers. Because of this complexity, on many phones system updates lag behind -- sometimes far behind -- the latest ""flavor"" of Android (currently 2.3 ""Gingerbread"" for phones). Unless you've rooted your Android phone to gain complete control over it, it's up to the carrier and manufacturer, not you, when your phone will get a system update. In contrast, iPhone system updates get deployed by a single source: Apple. So at any given time most iPhones in use probably have a fairly up-to-date version of iOS (unless it's a much older device, such as the iPhone 3G). Complicating this picture, to keep costs down some Android phone manufacturers skimp on processing power and other device capabilities. So some cheaper phones simply are not able to run the latest version of Android well, or at all. This is why some brand new but cheaper models come with vastly outdated flavors of Android -- like the Huawei Ascend, currently sold by MetroPCS for $99 on a $50/month no-contract plan, which comes with Android 2.1 (""Eclair,"" released back in January 2010). What red flags should mobile users watch for? According to Hering and Mahaffey, strange text messages coming from unknown sources are a common clue that you may have been subscribed unwittingly to a premium SMS service. You should contact your carrier immediately to report these. Also, check your phone bill online periodically -- probably more often than once a month. Malware can cause a lot of surreptitious activity on your phone, so battery performance might be a clue. ""If your battery suddenly starts draining really fast, consider that it might be malware,"" Mahaffey said. Hering also recommends healthy skepticism. ""Scrutinize permissions for Android apps before you download them. Does that game or utility really need permission to send premium SMS messages? Probably not,"" he said. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Attackers are using new techniques to distribute malware to phones .

"Dallas (CNN) -- Sara Rogers-Smith considers herself one of the lucky ones. She, her husband and two kids were allowed to return to their home Monday and found it in one piece after a wildfire swept the area. Some of their neighbors were not as fortunate. ""We definitely feel lucky,"" Rogers-Smith said in a telephone interview from her home in southwest Austin. ""The wind was blowing in the complete opposite direction of our house."" Have you been affected by wildfires? Send photos, videos . She said several other homes in her area were damaged and that at least two were burned to their foundations, leaving just metal and ash as reminders of what was. Dozens of large fires continued to burn out of control Monday in Texas in what officials have described as unprecedented conditions that show no signs of abating soon. ""We're experiencing conditions never seen in Texas before,"" said Marq Webb, a spokesman with the Texas Forest Service. ""Yesterday, we had 1,400 people and that number will go up today,"" he said in a telephone interview Monday from the service's incident command center in Merkel just west of Abilene. Perfect storm for wildfires . In all, the Forest Service has been asked to help battle fires covering some 700,000 acres, said Webb. Thirty-one fires were being fought in East Texas; another 11 fires in West Texas, officials said. ""We've had 19 consecutive days of just super-dry weather, relative humidities in the single digits,"" said Forest Service spokeswoman C.J. Norvell in Midland. ""What we're seeing right now is winds that are typical of spring, but everything else is typical of late summer -- no rain, vegetation that's just super dry. When you combine those two, it really has not boded well."" The Wildcat Fire just north of San Angelo has led to the evacuation of hundreds of people from their homes, Norvell said. The same fire threatens three small communities just north of San Angelo -- Robert Lee, Bronte and Tennyson, she said. A predicted change in wind direction from south to southwest could worsen the prognosis, she said. ""This little change is going to test some infrastructure and fire lines that we've set up,"" she said. The fires have a variety of causes -- some of them acts of nature, such as lightning strikes -- but most of them acts of man, said Webb. Those include anything from fence welding to debris burning, despite the fact that burn bans are in effect for 195 of the state's 254 counties, he said. Texas authorities have made an arrest in connection with one of hundreds of blazes scorching the state in what a Forest Service official called the ""perfect storm for wildfires."" A man was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, which is a felony under Texas law, Austin Fire Department Battalion Chief Palmer Buck said early Monday. The man, whom authorities did not immediately identify, was being held under a $50,000 bond. According to Buck, the man started a campfire at a homeless camp in a remote area, which got out of control and prompted evacuations. The fire burned about 60 acres. ""We're experiencing conditions we've never seen in Texas before,"" he said. ""We have a huge area of Texas with abundant fuels and they are tinder dry -- and I'm talking about probably half of the state."" Monday's forecast was worse than Sunday's, ""and tomorrow's supposed to be worse than today,"" he said. Though temperatures are expected to dip Wednesday, they were predicted to ramp back up on Thursday and Friday. Such weather has taxed the resources available to fight the fires. ""We're stretched pretty thin right now,"" Webb said. Conditions this spring are the driest they've been in Texas since 1917, said a Texas Forest Service spokeswoman. Authorities have responded to 7,807 fires across more than 1.5 million acres since this year's wildfire season began, Gov. Rick Perry wrote over the weekend in a letter to President Barack Obama. Perry requested that the federal government declare Texas a disaster area. Fires have affected all but two of the state's 254 counties. Perry noted that one firefighter has died and 18 others have been injured, while 244 homes have been destroyed and another 8,514 threatened residences ""saved."" CNN affiliate WFAA in Dallas-Fort Worth reported Bill Morris was one of the many Texans forced from his home by the fires. He spoke to the station as he was putting photographs and his wife's jewelry in the car, preparing to leave -- again. ""I've spent the night in a hotel three different times. And then I'm told I can come back, and come back just to get evacuated the next day,"" he said. In the Possum Kingdom complex west of Fort Worth, approximately 90 head of cattle were killed by the fire, said Webb. In southwest Austin, 10 homes suffered major damage and six suffered minor damage in a 100-acre area, said Matt Curtis, a spokesman for Mayor Lee Leffingwell. Curtis said Monday morning that the fire was contained, though firefighters were expected to spend the day looking for potential flareups and hot spots. ""Luckily, this fire happened in a somewhat unpopulated part of that neighborhood,"" he said. The multi-jurisdictional effort included the Austin Police Department, the Austin-Travis County Fire Department, the Austin-Travis County EMS, the Travis County Sheriff's Department and the Texas Forest Service. ""The mayor, who has lived in Austin all 72 of his years, described this as the largest fire he had ever seen in Austin and largest multi-jurisdictional effort,"" said Curtis. CNN's Leslie Tripp and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","Spring winds combined with dry conditions typical of late summer have ""not boded well""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Democratic presidential hopefuls stressed their common ground with the gay and lesbian community in a televised forum, but one significant exception loomed -- same-sex marriage. A panel that included lesbian rocker Melissa Etheridge questions Sen. Barack Obama. Thursday night's forum in Los Angeles was sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. It was broadcast on the gay-themed cable network Logo, making it the first-ever televised presidential forum on gay issues. The group said it offered Republican presidential candidates the opportunity to participate in their own forum, but they declined. The HRC, which claims 700,000 members, is the nation's largest advocacy group for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered communities. While officially non-partisan, the HRC overwhelmingly backs Democrats. In 2006, just 11 of the 219 federal candidates endorsed by the group were Republicans, and the HRC also backed the losing presidential bids of both Sen. John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000.  Watch how Democrats consider the gay community a key constituency Â» . With varying degrees of success, the front-running candidates in the Democratic field tried to reconcile their opposition to opening up marriage to gay and lesbian couples with their stated beliefs in gay and lesbian equality. Asked what was at the heart of her opposition to same-sex marriage, Sen. Hillary Clinton said, ""I prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions."" ""It's a personal position,"" she said. ""For me, we have made it very clear in our country that we believe in equality. How we get to full equality is the debate we're having."" Sen. Barack Obama said his view is that ""we should try to disentangle what has historically been the issue of the word 'marriage,' which has religious connotations to some people, from the civil rights that are given couples."" ""My job as president is going to be to make sure that the legal rights that have consequences on a day-to-day basis for loving same-sex couples all across the country ... are recognized and enforced,"" he said. John Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina and the Democratic Party's 2004 vice-presidential nominee, offered an apology for a previous statement that his religious faith was at the heart of his opposition to same-sex marriage. ""I shouldn't have said that,"" said Edwards, who has previously said he has struggled with his position. ""I believe to my core in equality. My campaign for the presidency is about equality across the board."" ""All I can tell you is where I am today,"" he said. ""I do not support same-sex marriage."" New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson cast his opposition to same-sex marriage in pragmatic terms, saying ""it's a question of doing what's achievable"" and trying to move the country forward on the issue. ""In my heart, I'm doing what is achievable,"" he said. ""And I'm not there yet, and the country isn't there yet."" However, two long-shot candidates in the field who do support same-sex marriage -- Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Mike Gravel, a former senator from Alaska -- made it clear they don't see why their rivals are so conflicted. ""This is really a question of whether you really believe in equality,"" Kucinich said. ""When you understand what real equality is, you understand that people who love each other must have the opportunity to be able to express that in a way that's meaningful."" Gravel accused his better-known rivals of ""playing it safe"" on the marriage issue and said he believes same-sex marriage ""will be a nonissue in the next presidential campaign"" in 2012. ""Marriage is a commitment between two human beings in love,"" Gravel said. ""And if there's anything we need in this world, it's more love."" A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Thursday found that a majority of Americans -- 57 percent -- oppose same-sex marriage. Forty-three percent oppose both same-sex marriage and civil unions, which offer most or some of the protections and benefits of marriage. All of the 2008 Democratic candidates are on record as supporting civil unions, a position also taken by President Bush, an opponent of same-sex marriage, during his 2004 re-election campaign. While just 3 percent of voters in the 2006 election identified themselves as gay or lesbian, the community has outsized influence, particularly among Democrats, because it is politically active and a source of campaign contributions. Reflecting that sway, six of the eight 2008 Democratic hopefuls -- all but Sens. Christopher Dodd and Joe Biden -- attended Thursday's event. Eschewing the usual debate format, candidates appeared on stage one at a time, where they sat in an easy chair and fielded questions from a panel that included lesbian rocker Melissa Etheridge. One area where the Democratic candidates were in clear agreement with gay rights advocates was on the question of ending the don't-ask-don't-tell policy, which allows gay men and lesbians to serve in the military only if they do not publicly disclose their sexual orientation. Clinton -- whose husband, former President Bill Clinton, originally proposed the policy in 1993 -- said she changed her mind in 1999 and that repealing it would be ""one of my highest priorities"" as president. Edwards also voiced his is opposition, but he noted that ""'don't-ask-don't-tell is not just wrong now, it was wrong when it began. It's been wrong the entire time."" Thursday's poll also found strong public support for ditching don't-ask-don't-tell. Fifty-seven percent of those polled opposed the policy itself, while 79 percent said openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Substitute John Brooks' headed goal four minutes from time gave the United States a dramatic 2-1 victory over Ghana in a Group G opening round World Cup match on Monday. Brooks scored from a corner kick just four minutes after Andre Ayew of Ghana equalized by giving Ghana the goal that had eluded its grasp much of the night. Clint Dempsey had given the United States a 1-0 lead with the quickest goal ever for the U.S. in a World Cup match. He netted just 29 seconds into the match, breaking into the penalty area and striking home a left-footed shot past sprawling Ghana goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey. It was the fifth fastest goal in World Cup history. ""We have a great spirit and (we) fight until the last second,"" U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. ""There is undoubtedly things that we need to improve. At the end of the day we got the three points."" The 2-1 scoreline was familiar but a turnaround from the 2006 and 2010 World Cups when Ghana eliminated the United States each time by the same score. After a frustrating first half, Ghana threatened more often in the second 45 minutes, finally getting the goal that seemed would be their destiny eight minutes from the end. Ayew finished neatly with the outside of his left boot after a flowing move that saw him collect a back heel from striker Asamoah Gyan. The favored Ghanaians spent much of the game in the U.S. end. They often knocked the ball around as the Americans sat back on defense, trying not to be beaten by the Africans' speed. Ghana, the youngest team in the tournament, attacked incessantly down the right side of the field in the first half, only to be undone by poor crosses that sailed high and wide. The United States chose to rely on counterattacks and in the 19th minute almost doubled its 1-0 lead when striker Jozy Altidore had a good chance that was thwarted by a sliding defender. It was heartbreak for the young American, who left the match with a hamstring injury two minutes later. He was replaced by Aron Johansson. The Americans spent much of the second half chasing the ball and only mustered a Dempsey shot in the 79th minute that was easily saved by Kwarasey until Brooks' stunning goal, his first in an international match. U.S. goalie Tim Howard had four saves. Kwarasey had three. The United States faces Portugal on Sunday, while Ghana plays Germany on Saturday.","Clint Dempsey scored after 29 seconds and the United States led for the next 81 minutes .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- If you are a young person living in Africa right now, it can be pretty confusing knowing what to believe: is it a hopeful place or is it trapped in a vicious cycle? Is it the site of the world's fastest growing economies, or is it a place where more than 200 schoolgirls are kidnapped and held captive for two weeks with no hope of recovery? On the one hand, much more than half of the employable young population is out of a job and there are many caught in wars and rumors of wars, from Sudan's two sides to the Central African Republic. But on the other, there's growth and palpable excitement: Africa is the continent to watch; investment is pouring in for technology and a whole range of businesses both new and traditional, many countries boast impressive GDPs; democracy is solidifying, and with it free speech and citizen engagement, a flourishing sense of enterprise and a groundswell of creativity. There is no greater symbol of this confusion than Nigeria at this exact moment. On the one hand, we are the focus of the world, with our GDP rebased and our economy enjoying something of a rebirth; and yet on the other, we are the focus of the world, with bombs tearing through our nation's capital, and girls abducted in broad daylight by domestic terrorists. With the World Economic Forum coming to Abuja this week, I see myself frenziedly planning alongside other Global Shapers across Lagos, Abuja and Kano to welcome the world to our country and to show its vast potential, looking forward to the sessions and the panels focused on inclusive growth and job creation. At the same time I sit on the board of Enough is Enough Nigeria, which is passionately, angrily demanding that the world cancels the World Economic Forum on Africa to send a message to our lethargic president that he must find the 234 girls who have been missing for 18 days, and stop the violence that has taken the lives of over 1,500 in the north of Nigeria this year. How can I be excited about going to Abuja next week for the Forum when a bomb just went off in the city's center? Should I tweet #WEFAfrica, or #BringBackTheGirls? Talk about schizophrenia. I find myself confused, pulled in both directions. Yet I find both imperatives compelling, almost inevitable. I believe this is the most urgent challenge for young people like me, growing up in a time of great flux. The world has so much faith in young Africans at the moment -- and with good reason; see what we've done with technology, the creative industries and civil society, for instance -- urging and willing us to fulfill the promise that is in abundance amongst us, to become the ""turning point generation."" But if only the world understood how frustrating it can be to have hope in the future of Nigeria when its power sector remains comatose, corrupt ministers collude with the legislature, people die in stadiums while jostling for jobs, and governments strangle small businesses with multiple taxation and out-of-touch policies. We have the important duty to maintain hope, keep up the excitement; channel the energy and take advantage of the opportunities that exist around us. But at the same time, we must maintain perspective, and avoid burying our heads in the sand; we must demand better governance and speak with clarity and integrity about the failings of our leaders in government and the private sector. Our eyes must be fixed on the stars, but our feet must stand firmly on the ground. It is a delicate balance, but we have no choice. We must play the hand our continent has dealt us. We have no choice.","Nigeria hits headlines because of kidnap of 200 schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The South Korean president on Monday warned North Korea that any provocative moves will be met with ""a strong response"" as the United States deployed stealth fighter jets in the tense region as part of joint military exercises. ""If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations,"" President Park Geun-hye said at a meeting with senior defense and security officials, according to her office. Her comments came after North Korea rattled off fresh volleys of bombastic rhetoric over the weekend, declaring that it had entered a ""state of war"" with the South and labeling the U.S. mainland a ""boiled pumpkin,"" vulnerable to attack. Read more: Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . The two Koreas are technically still at war after their conflict in the early 1950s ended in a truce not a peace treaty. The secretive regime of Kim Jong Un has delivered a steady stream of verbal attacks against South Korea and the United States in recent weeks, including the threat of a nuclear strike. It has lashed out at the U.S.-South Korean military drills currently under way and at the tougher U.N. sanctions that were slapped on it after its latest nuclear test in February. Analysts have expressed heavy skepticism that the North has the military capabilities to follow through on many of its melodramatic threats. But concerns remain that it could carry out a localized attack on South Korea, as it did in November 2010 when it shelled Yeongpyeong Island, killing four people. Displays of strength . The United States has sought to show its willingness to defend its South Korean ally by drawing attention to displays of its military strength during the drills taking place in South Korea. Washington's recent announcements concerning practice flights over South Korea by B-52 bombers and B-2 stealth bombers, both of which can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons, have not been lost on Pyongyang, which has described them as acts of U.S. hostility. Read more: N Korea readying rockets to aim at U.S. targets . There was no immediate reaction on North Korean state media Monday to the U.S. statement saying the stealth fighters, F-22 Raptors, were sent to the main U.S. Air Force Base in South Korea to support air drills in the annual Foal Eagle training exercises there. U.S. and South Korean officials have been trying to strike a balance between acknowledging that the North's rhetoric is cause for concern and at the same time playing down the severity of the threat. Park said Monday that she was ""viewing the threat from North Korea in a serious manner."" But a senior U.S. Defense Department official said late last week that there were ""no indications at this point that it's anything more than warmongering rhetoric."" South Korea has noted that scores of its workers have continued in recent days to enter and leave the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas situated on the North's side of the border. That is despite Pyongyang cutting a key military hotline on the border and threatening to shut down the complex. Read more: Why N Korea regime is scary . Moscow and Beijing call for calm . The heightened tensions have prompted North Korea's traditional allies, China and Russia, to urge the different sides to keep a lid on the situation. ""Moscow expects all parties to exercise as much responsibility and restraint as possible in light of North Korea's latest statements,"" the Russian foreign ministry said Saturday according to Russian state broadcaster Russia Today. China, which expressed frustration over Pyongyang's most recent nuclear test, also called for calm. ""We hope relevant parties can work together to turn around the tense situation in the region,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Friday, describing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula as ""a joint responsibility."" But the coming weeks appear laced with potential for more bouts of saber-rattling. North Korean delegates are currently gathered in Pyongyang for the Supreme People's Assembly, the country's rubber stamp parliament. And April 15 is the anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. That day, the biggest national holiday in North Korea, is usually marked by large-scale parades. Meanwhile, the U.S.-South Korean military exercises that have already stirred so much ire from the North are due to continue until the end of the month. Finally, some analysts have noted that Pyongyang has carried out some sort of military provocation within weeks of every South Korean presidential inauguration. Park, the current president, took office on February 25, five weeks ago. CNN's K.J.

"(CNN) -- Denise Garrido seemed stunned when she was announced the winner of Miss Universe Canada on Saturday. The 26-year-old, who has a black belt in taekwondo and a degree in biomedical sciences, waved to the crowd in Toronto before being surrounded by the 56 other contestants. At one point she had trouble keeping her crown on; she got some help to keep it stabilized. It wouldn't stay on for long. The next day, the organization that operates the pageant -- which chooses the country's contestant for the Miss Universe competition -- announced it had made a mistake. Garrido was third runner up. The winner was actually Riza Santos, 26, who has served in the Canadian military and studied engineering. ""It was definitely shocking,"" Garrido said on CNN's ""Starting Point"" Wednesday. ""You go through this complete high and your entire family, your town is all celebrating, wishing you congratulations. And then 24 hours later, you're told, 'Oh, by the way.'"" But, she added, ""Things happen for a reason. And I really wanted to win Ms. Universe Canada, and I won Ms. Universe Canada. It may not have ended exactly as I had hoped for, but (for) 24 hours I was Ms. Universe Canada, and now Riza gets to share in on this experience and she gets one fantastic year ahead of her."" The two women appeared live on CNN from different locations in what they said was their first conversation since the mix-up was announced. ""I don't feel like I missed out,"" Santos said of the experience she didn't get to have: the televised moment of victory. ""After Denise was crowned I was disappointed, because I felt like I did well in the competition, but I know Denise as a person and I was happy for her genuinely."" ""I feel bad that I took away that moment from her,"" Garrido said. ""But at the same time, Riza, I am glad that we kind of share this bonding experience."" The two said they've known each other for a couple of years. ""I've always known you to be a person of integrity and just a respectful, positive person,"" Santos responded. ""I thank you so much for your graciousness during this time."" The day after the competition, when officials were validating the scoring results, ""a typo was discovered in the top 5 entries, which significantly impacted the final results of the competition,"" Beauties of Canada said on its website. ""This is an unfortunate circumstance where a human error was made, and in such a situation, as difficult as it is, it is only right to correct the error."" In a separate statement, the organization offered Garrido a ""sincere apology,"" adding, ""We have no doubt she will continue to succeed in her endeavors and we wish her well."" Garrido hasn't yet decided on her next step. ""Probably education, masters, med school,"" she told CNN. ""Who knows what the future holds for me right now."" Santos said discovering that she had won ""and I had this opportunity to represent Canada on the world stage was a huge honor for me and very humbling at the same time.""

"(WIRED)  -- For one day, at least, you can call off the cyberwar. The Pentagon has revealed an unclassified version of its ""Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace."" And despite a drumbeat of scare talk and digital sabre-rattling in Washington, the document takes a measured, reasonable approach -- focusing on good network hygiene and data-sharing, rather than bombing hackers into submission. The question is whether this public summary conveys what's actually in the classified strategy, or reflects the real mood of the Department of Defense. ""DoD would like to be much more aggressive in what it says and how it acts,"" says a source familiar with the development of the strategy. ""But that tendency to be aggressive has been reined in by the State Department, Treasury, and the White House, and not in an unreasonable way."" Listen to the talk inside the Washington Beltway -- and especially within the Pentagon -- and you'd think hackers were about to reach their hands through our computers, and strangle us all in our sleep. WIRED: Insiders doubt 2008 Pentagon hack was foreign spy attack . ""The United States is fighting a cyber-war today, and we are losing,"" retired admiral and former National Security Agency chief Mike McConnell wrote in the Washington Post last year. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta claimed cyber attacks could be the ""next Pearl Harbor we confront."" Or perhaps the next Hiroshima. Senator Carl Levin declared that ""cyberweapons and cyberattacks potentially can be devastating, approaching weapons of mass destruction in their effects"" during an April 2010 (.pdf) hearing. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Pentagon has come to the conclusion that ""computer sabotage... can constitute an act of war."" As one military official tells the paper: ""If you shut down our power grid, maybe we will put a missile down one of your smokestacks."" Yet the Pentagon strategy uses tones of cooperation, not confrontation, in the strategy it released today. ""By sharing timely indicators about cyber events, threat signatures of malicious code, and information about emerging actors and threats, allies and international partners can increase collective cyber defense,"" the document notes. ""Cyberspace is a network of networks that includes thousands of ISPs [Internet Service Providers] across the globe; no single state or organization can maintain effective cyber defenses on its own."" WIRED: Cyber war hype intended to destroy the open Internet . Yes, there are all kinds of bad guys out there on the internet, the strategy adds. But many of them are out for money, not for blood. ""The tools and techniques developed by cyber criminals are increasing in sophistication at an incredible rate, and many of these capabilities can be purchased cheaply on the internet."" And the best way to stop these crooks is through strong passwords, up-to-date software, and keeping unclassified disks and drives off of secret systems. ""Most vulnerabilities of and malicious acts against DoD systems can be addressed through good cyber hygiene,"" document adds. If there was a nod to the McConnell crowd -- who'd like to ""reengineer the internet"" to make everyone trackable online -- it was in the declaration that ""DoD will pursue revolutionary technologies that rethink the technological foundations of cyberspace."" But the nod was a subtle one. Behind closed doors, some Pentagon officials take a much harder line. There have been calls to massively shift Defense Department spending from defensive measures to online offense. Other countries -- especially the Chinese, they believe -- had infiltrated every corner of the military-industrial complex, and need to be shoved back. Every fresh online break-in brings a fevered call to declare the intrusion an ""act of war."" But that view is not universally shared in Washington. ""There is no cyberwar,"" White House cyber czar Howard Schmidt has repeatedly said. And those more rational voices helped keep the rhetoric in this Pentagon strategy from overheating. As one source who watched the strategy develop, says: ""This the result of a long, political process."" But this is hardly the final document, Gen. James ""Hoss"" Cartwright tells reporters. ""This strategy talks more about how we are going to defend the networks,"" says Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the most influential voices on cybersecurity in the Defense Department. ""The next iteration will have to start to talk about here's a strategy that says to the attacker, 'If you do this, the price to you is going to go up. It's not just free.'"" ""Today, we are on a path that is way too predictable. It's purely defensive. There is no penalty for attacking right now,"" Cartwright adds. ""We've got to figure out a way to change that.""

"(CNN) -- North Korea on Friday responded to tougher sanctions from the U.N. Security Council with another barrage of vitriol, repeating a vow to ditch all nonaggression pacts with the South. A day after the isolated regime in Pyongyang had threatened a possible ""pre-emptive nuclear attack,"" something analysts say they think is unlikely, its official news agency reeled off a number of agreements with South Korea that it said would no longer apply. It's the latest installment in a week of furious rhetoric from the North, fueled by its anger over the U.N. vote on the new sanctions, a response to North Korea's recent nuclear test, and joint military drills by the United States and South Korea, which take place in the region each year. North Korea watchers and U.S. officials said the recent frenzy of ominous language from North Korea under its young leader Kim Jong Un makes the situation on the Korean Peninsula more worrying and unpredictable. South Korea has warned the North that it will retaliate strongly and sternly if its citizens are threatened. ""This surge in provocative rhetoric is particularly dangerous,"" said Michael Auslin of the American Enterprise Institute. ""South Korea's new president can't be seen to back down in the face of the North's threats, while Kim Jong Un may feel that his successful missile and nuclear tests give him the ability to keep pressuring Seoul. The two may wind up talking themselves into conflict."" South Korean President Park Geun-hye, who took office late last month, said Friday that Seoul would respond strongly to any provocation from Pyongyang, the semiofficial news agency Yonhap reported. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel offered a similar promise. ""The United States of America and our allies are prepared to deal with any threat,"" Hagel said. The possibility of a flare-up was highlighted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, which predicted a provocative move from the North ""in the coming weeks."" The center said that according to its research, Pyongyang has carried out ""a military provocation of some form within weeks of every South Korean presidential inauguration dating back to 1992."" A military clash could risk drawing in the United States, which has about 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as part of the security alliance between the two countries. The most recent skirmish between the two Koreas took place in November 2010, when the North shelled an island on the South's side of the border, killing several people. Pyongyang claimed Seoul had provoked it by carrying out training exercises off the countries' shared coast. The United States is using satellites, radar and aircraft near the Korean Peninsula in its recently stepped-up surveillance of North Korea, U.S. military sources said. So far, though, there are no signs of unusual military moves by North Korean forces, according to the same U.S. military officials. A week of strong threats . The North's comments on Friday reiterated statements it had made earlier this week promising to abolish the armistice agreement that stopped the Korean War in 1953 and threatening strikes on the United States and South Korea. Claiming its enemies are ""hell bent on confrontation and war fever,"" Pyongyang said it was now revoking ""all agreements on nonaggression reached between the North and the South,"" a declaration it has made in previous years. It also said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The North, which conducted its third underground nuclear test last month, had said recently that denuclearization of the region was impossible because of what it described as the United States' hostile policy toward it. It also stated that it was immediately cutting off the ""North-South hot line,"" three days after it had already said it planned to terminate its military telephone line with the United States. The phone line is meant to serve as a tool to defuse potential flash points along the heavily militarized border between the two Koreas. But Andre Kok, deputy public affairs officer for U.S. Forces in Korea, said that reports of the North's Korean People's Army, known as the KPA, cutting off communication often arise when military training exercises are taking place, as they are at the moment. ""When we place a call on the direct phone line and the KPA does not answer, we have no way of knowing if the KPA has actually disconnected the phone lines or are just not answering the phone,"" he said. On Saturday, North Korea's foreign ministry said sanctions against the North over the last eight years have only caused it to bolster its nuclear deterrent program ""qualitatively and quantitatively,"" according to the North's official news agency, KCNA. On Friday afternoon, Pentagon spokesman George Little said North Korea ""will achieve nothing through threats of provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia."" Little said the United Sates ""calls on (North Korea) to refrain from further threats and provocative actions,"" and said the United States is fully capable of defending itself and its allies, including South Korea and Japan. New U.N. measures . Tensions are particularly high at the moment because of the new measures against the North adopted unanimously on Thursday by the U.N. Security Council. ""These sanctions will bite, and bite hard,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said after the vote. China, North Korea's key ally, could have used its veto power to block the sanctions. Instead, after weeks of negotiating, it signed on to the final draft. ""China is a country of principle,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Li Baodong said. ""We are firmly committed to safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean peninsula."" On Friday, China's Foreign Ministry called upon ""all relative parties to stay calm and refrain from taking actions that may escalate tension."" Spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated China's support for the sanctions, which have stoked Pyongyang's fury. The goal of the new sanctions is to stymie the activities of North Korean banks and cash couriers who might be funneling money to the secretive regime's nuclear and missile programs. It will be tougher for the regime to move large sums of cash stuffed into suitcases, Rice said. The U.N. resolution also outlines measures to step up scrutiny of suspicious sea shipments and air cargo and it expands restrictions to encompass several institutions and senior officials in the North's weapons industry, as well as a range of materials and technology known to be used in uranium enrichment. It also blocks the sale of luxury goods, such as yachts and certain high-end jewelry, to North Korea. ""As a result, North Korea's ruling elite, who have been living large while impoverishing their people, will pay a price"" for the ongoing nuclear activities, Rice said. Questions over sanctions' effectiveness . Some doubt whether the new measures will make much difference. Sanctions imposed after previous nuclear tests and rocket launches have failed to deter Pyongyang. China will go a long way toward determining whether the new sanctions really do have bite, analysts say. ""As long as China allows North Korea to operate, as long as China provides food, energy assistance and investment, the sanctions really don't matter,"" said Doug Bandow of the Cato Institute. North Korea notoriously allows many of its people to live in malnutrition and starvation. Still, the country needs a functioning economy, partly to finance its military, Bandow said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States is committed to taking action to compel North Korea to alter its approach. ""We're ... going to continue to increase the pressure if they don't make the right choice,"" Nuland said.

"(CNN) -- The security firm Blackwater USA is starting to resume normal operations in Iraq after a hiatus sparked by concerns among Iraqi and U.S. government officials over its actions. Blackwater USA contractors secure the site of a roadside bombing in Baghdad in July 2005. Tom Casey, a State Department spokesman, said on Friday that Blackwater and two other security firms that provide protection for U.S. diplomats in Iraq are resuming civilian convoys on a case-by-case basis. All Blackwater USA operations in Iraq will be back to normal on Saturday, a highly placed industry source told CNN on Friday. A deadly shooting incident on Sunday prompted the Iraqi government to bar the firm from operating. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad has been prohibiting staff-member trips by land outside the Green Zone amid investigations into the incident. The Iraqi government has said as many as 20 civilians were killed by gunfire from Blackwater USA contractors who were guarding a U.S. diplomatic convoy. Iraqi officials dispute the U.S. claim that the guards were responding to an attack. The Blackwater employees involved in the incident are still in Iraq, but those who fired weapons -- about a third of the guards -- were ""standing down,"" said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. Outside experts may be brought in to help review the ""protective service details"" in Baghdad, McCormack said. Such details usually have 15 to 20 guards. The ""full, complete review"" would look at rules of engagement and overall operations, with consultation with lawyers over what authority contractors operate under, he said. Sunday's shooting has created new tension between the U.S. and Iraqi governments. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed regret about the incident in a phone call to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and promised an open and transparent probe into what happened.  Watch heavily armed private contractors at work in Iraq Â» . ""It is extremely important to recognize we are doing important work (in Iraq). We need protection for our diplomats and I am quite certain with good will we can resolve this,"" Rice said. The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday the creation of a joint commission to examine issues of security and safety in the aftermath of the shooting incident. The commission, co-chaired by an American and an Iraqi with equal representation from both countries, will receive the results of the State Department investigation and the separate Iraqi investigation, Casey said. The commission will look at the Sunday incident and the broader issue of ""personal security details"" and the use of private contractors to provide security in Iraq, he said. The commission ""is not an investigative body doing field forensics on this particular matter,"" Casey said. ""The focus of this is to look not only at that incident but at the broader question ... and help us come up with joint recommendations."" In describing the actions of the private guards for the State Department in Iraq, McCormack said that since January 2007 there have been 1,800 movements outside the Green Zone. ""It is only a small fraction, a very small fraction, that has involved the use of force,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The going is always soft and the only permanent building is a toilet block. It's the antithesis to the pomp and pageantry of Royal Ascot ... welcome to Laytown Racecourse. If you overlook Laytown beach, a mere 30 miles north of the capital Dublin on Ireland's east coast, you would usually see golden sand stretching far and wide, the tide pulsing in and out of shore, the elements battering the coastline and the occasional dog walker. But for a few hours each year, as has been the custom ever since 1868, it becomes the site of arguably the world's most unique annual racehorse meeting. Racegoers from all over the globe have attended the September event, including musicians, film stars and royalty, while top trainers and leading jockeys have also played their part. ""There truly is nothing like it, it's truly unique,"" says Kevin Coleman, who was born and brought up in Laytown and is one of a small team that runs the meeting. ""I think it's the only race meeting in the world that can truly be described as unique. I think there's beach racing in Spain but this is the only one that completely adheres to the rules of racing. But it's a bit less formal."" Forces of nature . Unlike Royal Ascot, where top hat and tails are the order of the day for attendees, Coleman merely asks that punters, of which there are typically about 5-6,000 each year, aim for smart casual. ""My first memory of the racing is coming down to the beach as a child and playing football,"" he recalls. ""The game would start with six of us and then end with 26 by the time various people had finished their tea. ""During the end of the summer, you'd gradually see the beach taking shape for the racing. ""But there was such a mystery about it too as a child, how it all appeared and suddenly happened. In this role (which he has had since 1998), I realize there is no mystery, just a lot of logistics and hard work!"" That is not merely setting up the venue for the event but battling the forces of nature -- the past year the coastal erosion has been even more noticeable. But come rain, shine or even wartime, Laytown has almost always gone ahead. Its last cancellation came in 2002 when a deluge caused storm waters to overspill, making it no longer safe to start the racing. ""We don't know what Neptune will throw at us on a particular date,"" Coleman says. Star attraction . On Thursday there will be six races, each with a maximum of 10 horses and all run over six to seven furlongs, across the width of the beach. Coleman hopes there will once again be notable names in attendance. The Aga Khan visited in the 1950s, the actors from movies ""The Crying Game"" and ""Michael Collins,"" both of which were filmed in Laytown, are believed to have attended, while Neil Hannon, singer with The Divine Comedy, has been a regular. Celebrities, though, are treated no differently to any other patrons -- who come from as far afield as Australia and the United States. ""We wouldn't know who most of them were and anyway we'd leave them be,"" says Coleman. ""They're all here for the same thing as us, aren't they?"" Belgium's former ambassador to Ireland, Alain Guillaume, was so drawn by a picture of Laytown in the Embassy that he felt compelled to visit. ""It's really something,"" he said. ""I've never seen anything like it. To have horses racing out in the natural environment is wonderful."" It is a meeting that comes with everything you'd expect at a normal course -- the racing rails, winning post, a grandstand, jockey weighing room (though in a marquee) and even now a tent for corporate facilities. Entrance is the same price for everyone, just $10, while you can place a bet with bookmakers there. But don't expect to see horses of the caliber of Kentucky Derby winners at Laytown. ""The racing is pretty ordinary really,"" Coleman admits. ""I remember speaking to Colin Keane, an up-and-coming jockey, last year, and asking him what it was like to ride. ""I thought he'd say it was a magical experience but he just told me it was 'slow, slower than other years.' "" Tragedy brings change . Building the course is a race against time. When the tide goes out, organizers shovel up and pat down the sand to create the racing line, but such are the elements that occasional pools of surface water can remain, which some horses don't mind but others despise -- merely another nuance to the racing at Laytown. As magical and mystical as the event sounds, it has not been without its own setbacks. Twenty years ago marked its bleakest year, with three equine fatalities and two riders seriously injured. ""One of the jockeys never rode again,"" says Coleman ruefully. Back then, the horses used to charge out to sea, with the field turning back on themselves in a semicircle. Major safety changes were brought in, and Coleman says organizers had to plead with Ireland's racing authorities to keep holding the event. ""Other changes meant only horses over the age of four could compete, and horses were not allowed to wear blinkers,"" he adds. The racing was allowed to carry on and, 146 years since the first meeting at Laytown Racecourse, the event goes from strength to strength -- the Guinness flows, the music plays and hooves thunder in the sand.","Thousands flock each year to see the novelty of a full race meeting on a beach .

"(CNN) -- BP announced Wednesday it has reached a class-action settlement with attorneys representing thousands of businesses and individuals who made claims after the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The basic terms were announced two days before the second anniversary of the disaster that began with a rig explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon. Eleven workers died. A federal judge must give preliminary approval of the pact, which BP estimates will total about $7.8 billion, including associated costs and expenses. The company, in a statement, cautioned the final tally could be higher. ''This settlement demonstrates BP's continued progress in resolving significant issues related to the Deepwater Horizon accident,'' said BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley. ""BP made a commitment to help economic and environmental restoration efforts in the Gulf Coast, and this settlement provides the framework for us to continue delivering on that promise, offering those affected full and fair compensation, without waiting for the outcome of a lengthy trial process.'' The settlement would be paid from a $20 billion trust, BP said. Oil spewed into the sea for nearly three months before a cap was placed on the BP-owned Macondo well, nearly a mile beneath the surface. The spill damaged coral reef formations, according to researchers. Scientists have previously confirmed that a plume of hydrocarbons from the well settled in the deep Gulf. Coral damage linked to spill . Two agreements would cover the majority of economic, property and medical damage claims, BP said. The plaintiffs and BP ""believe that the settlement agreements are a fair, reasonable and adequate resolution of the claims,"" the company said. BP has asked a court to delay a liability trial until it decides whether to grant final approval to the agreements. The Plaintiffs' Steering Committee said, generally, there is no cap on the amount BP will pay to those who agree to the settlement. The committee said BP has agreed to pay $2.3 billion to members of the seafood industry. ""The people and businesses of the Gulf Coast stand to reap great benefits from these settlements,"" said plaintiffs counsels James P. Roy and Stephen J. Herman. ""We have held BP fully accountable for the Deepwater Horizon tragedy less than two years after the spill. Through extensive arms-length, good-faith negotiations, hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast residents and businesses will be made whole."" The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said about 59,200 barrels of liquid oil a day flowed from the well. Pipeline company proposes new route . In September, the government issued a formal report on the oil spill, finding that BP, Transocean and Halliburton all shared responsibility for the explosion, but that BP was ""ultimately responsible"" for operations at the site ""in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment."" A federal judge in New Orleans earlier this year ruled that Halliburton is not liable for the some of the compensatory damages sought by third parties in the worst oil spill in U.S. history, leaving BP responsible for the majority of those claims. The judgment was similar to the decision that came down regarding Deepwater Horizon rig owner Transocean's responsibility. Halliburton was contracted by BP to cement the well and had argued its contract protected the energy company from legal action resulting from its work. BP and Halliburton sued each other in April 2011, each claiming the other was to blame for the deadly explosion and resulting leak. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","BP, plaintiffs reach settlement on class-action claims .

"(CNN) -- Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has come out in favor of legalizing drugs in an attempt to disrupt the illegal markets that have turned parts of Mexico into battlegrounds. In a proposal published over the weekend on his website, Fox argued that drug addiction and drug-related violence should be treated as distinct and separate challenges. ""So, drug consumption is the responsibility of the person who consumes; of the family who is responsible for educating; and of the education system and the socioeconomic context,"" wrote Fox, who was president from 2000 to 2006. ""What we have to do is legalize the production, the sale and the distribution."" Although Fox and current President Felipe Calderon both hail from the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, their views diverge on the issue of how to combat drug violence. While Fox advocates weakening the cartels by legalizing their market, Calderon has launched an offensive against the drug cartels that has resulted in headline-grabbing drug-related violence in some parts of Mexico. According to the government, more than 28,000 people have been killed in the drug war since Calderon took office in 2006. Fox said Mexican troops should return to the barracks. The army was not designed nor trained to fight organized crime, Fox said. Removing the troops would also ensure that soldiers would not cross the line into human rights abuses. In his proposal, Fox also called for the creation of a single national police to provide security, arguing that current state and local police bodies have become corrupted. Some teams from the military could be added to the new police force, he said. A third proposal was for citizens to directly elect police chiefs, commanders and others in charge of security. ""Legalizing in this sense doesn't mean that drugs are good or don't hurt those who consume,"" Fox wrote. ""Rather, we have to see it as a strategy to strike and break the economic structure that allows the mafias to generate huge profits in their business.""","Vicente Fox says legalizing drugs is best way to destabilize the drug cartels .

"(CNN) -- A possible workers strike at Belmont Park racetrack on Long Island, New York, could rein in I'll Have Another's chance at the coveted Triple Crown title on Saturday. More than 80 of the racetrack's maintenance workers and starters have threatened to go on strike in the days leading up to the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown. The workers, who take care of the grounds and racetrack at Belmont in addition to putting the horses in the gate, have been embroiled in a contract dispute with the New York Racing Association over wages and employee contributions to health care costs since 2010, said Vincent McElroen, financial secretary of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 3 union. The union voted to authorize a strike more than a week ago, he said. ""They're trying to get a message to the employer that this is serious stuff,"" McElroen added. Racing association officials issued a statement calling UBEW Local 3's potential strike ""extremely self-serving,"" alleging that the union is using ""the attention and excitement of a Triple Crown attempt to further its own agenda."" I'll Have Another -- the 3-year-old colt who claimed victory in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes this year -- would be the first horse to take the Triple Crown in 34 years. Since 1990, only seven horses have won the first two legs of the title. Racetrack officials are expecting a crowd of more than 100,000 for Saturday's race. McElroen said the timing of the potential strike has nothing to do with the Belmont Stakes. ""We've been negotiating for 24 months,"" he said. ""We've gotten nowhere, and the workers are fed up."" Part of the dispute revolves around the definition of the workweek. In their former contract, which ended after a year-long extension in early 2011, UBEW workers were paid overtime on weekends, McElroen said. But in 2012, the racing association changed the workweek to reflect Belmont's Wednesday through Sunday race schedule, eliminating weekend overtime pay. ""This change resulted in a drastic reduction in their take-home pay,"" McElroen said. UBEW workers at Belmont have also had to start paying into their health insurance benefits and are no longer given retiree medical benefits, he added. In the statement, New York Racing Association officials responded that ""Local 3 is unwilling to pay a reasonable share of the cost to provide these benefits and they refuse to work with us to create shifts that reflect the reality of how a race track operates.""

"(CNN) -- Many Verizon Wireless customers were unable to access the mobile internet early Wednesday morning because of a network glitch, the company said. The ""technical glitch,"" which occurred during network maintenance, stopped Verizon users from being able to access mobile websites from about 1:40 to 5 a.m. ET on Wednesday, said Jeffrey Nelson, a Verizon Wireless spokesman. The outage affected a ""large part of the country,"" but not all Verizon customers, Nelson said. Verizon users were still able to send and receive data on Verizon's 3G network, he said, but could not access websites through a phone's mobile browser. Reports of a ""nationwide"" Verizon outage hit tech blogs and Twitter on Wednesday morning. Engadget had this to say on the subject: . ""We've heard from a bunch of folks this morning that Verizon's 3G network is experiencing a slight bout of disconnectedness, causing a great deal of grief and discombobulation around the country. Just sit tight, we're sure engineers are engineering solutions as we type this, and will update you as soon as things have been rectified."" Some Twitter users reported losing internet service on their phones. ""Dear #Verizon, please let your customers know if and when a #3G outage is happening. It would save me the stress of thinking my phone died.."" wrote one user, named @bigred89. Others, however, wrote that they were able to connect to the network without trouble. @wscato wrote: ""Verizon 3G appears to be back up in Charlotte, NC."" By mid-morning Wednesday, Verizon was declaring the problem resolved on its customer-support Twitter feed. In response to questions on Twitter, Verizon employees told customers to restart their mobile phones by powering them off and then turning them back on.","Verizon Wireless experiences network problems on Wednesday morning .
