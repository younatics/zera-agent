"(CNN) -- To ease the heartache of her first child's stillbirth, Kelli Montgomery chose rigorous exercise, yoga and meditation over the antidepressants and sleeping pills that her physicians immediately suggested. ""'You need to be on this medication or that medication.' It was shocking to me that that was the first line of defense,"" said Montgomery, 42, director of the MISS Foundation for Grieving Families in Austin, Texas. ""From the time I was in the hospital to when I was seeing my general practitioner, that's what they were insisting on."" Her choice stemmed partly from a longtime aversion to taking prescription drugs. It was also the result of listening to a growing group of psychiatrists, psychologists and clinical social workers from around the world who argue that depression and other normal responses to life's toughest challenges are too often labeled as disorders -- and as such, demand medicine with sometimes dangerous side effects. Protesters such as Montgomery contend diagnoses of serious psychological and psychiatric disorders have also needlessly skyrocketed alongside the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' expanding list of what constitutes mental illness. The manual is considered the bible of psychiatry because it's the criteria mental health professionals use to diagnose patients. One example of the issue is the frequency of bipolar disorder in children. It has jumped 40-fold in the last two decades, said Dr. Bernard Carroll, a former Duke University psychiatry department chairman. Using downward dogs to treat depression . ""You've got all these young kids running around with this diagnosis, yet many of them have never, ever had a manic episode, which is the hallmark of bipolar disorder,"" said Carroll, now the scientific director of the Pacific Behavioral Research Foundation. ""Many of these kids,"" he continued, ""have never had anything other than irritability. Yet they're exposed to anti-convulsants, anti-psychotic drugs, which have serious long-term side effects in the form of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and some movement disorders ... that can leave a person extremely disfigured physically."" The International DSM-5 Response Committee -- named after the upcoming fifth incarnation of that diagnostic manual -- plans to launch a campaign next month aimed at blocking the manual's May 20 release. Short of that, critics plan to press ahead with their case that the DSM-5 should be viewed with some skepticism and not wholly embraced by practitioners or patients. ""We believe that there is now overwhelming evidence that DSM-5 is scientifically unsound (and) statistically unreliable,"" said clinical psychologist Peter Kinderman, director of the University of Liverpool's Institute of Psychology, Health and Society. He is helping organize the international campaign with petition drives in the United States, the United Kingdom and France. The American Psychiatric Association, whose manual has been used by health insurers, pharmaceutical companies, doctors and other clinicians since it first published in 1952, has dismissed DSM-5 opponents as overly alarmed. ""All the good epidemiological studies unfortunately show that one in five people have a psychological disorder. ... They're prevalent, they're just all over the place, and that's very disturbing to some people,"" said Dr. Carl Bell, a Chicago psychiatrist and University of Illinois School of Medicine director of public health and community psychiatry. One of 15 members of a DSM-5 committee zeroing in on personality disorders, Bell spoke on behalf of the psychiatric association. ""If you dig down into (the DSM-5), it's an extraordinarily complex document."" Being transgender no longer a mental 'disorder' in diagnostic manual . However, critics contend, the manual's shortcomings include its lack of scientifically conclusive field testing of some of its recommendations; its failure to consider the prior effectiveness or ineffectiveness of anti-psychotic drugs to determine a patient's present diagnosis; and its lumping of, for example, what had been a spectrum of depressions -- from the mildly melancholic to the severely debilitating -- into one group. ""This is the reason that people nowadays are jumping up and saying, 'The antidepressant drugs don't work,'"" Carroll said. ""If you take this broad category, it's difficult to even show why they don't work."" ""There's a great deal of a concern, so we are hardly voices in the wilderness,"" said Dr. Allen Frances, author of the book ""Saving Normal: An Insider's Revolt Against Out of Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma and the Medicalization of Ordinary Life."" He is largely credited with spearheading anti-DMS-5 efforts. ""A petition regarding DSM-5, signed by 50-plus associations, was presented to the (psychiatric association), asking for an independent scientific review. The association brushed it aside,"" said Frances, a Duke professor emeritus and former psychiatric department chairman. The psychiatric association says the DSM-5 was independently reviewed for 18 months but that those findings will not be made public. Also, the reviewers' identities will not be disclosed until the manual is released. ""The development of DSM-5 began with an unprecedented process of research evaluation that included a series of white papers and 13 scientific conferences supported by the National Institutes of Health,"" wrote Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who oversees the entire DSM-5 task force, in an e-mail. ""This preparation brought together more than 400 international scientists and produced a series of monographs and peer-reviewed journal articles. DSM-5 is the product of the most extensive discussion and debate -- as part of the most transparent process -- of any DSM."" Mental illness in children: Know the signs . Frances contends that the process, though conducted with volunteers, has been somewhat secretive and did not sufficiently consider objections to what the manual will contain. Frances led the task force that produced the DSM IV in 2000. ""What motivates me is the experience of having inadvertently contributed to fads and psycho-diagnosis that have resulted in over-diagnosis and over-treatment,"" Frances said. ""Some of this happened during DSM IV, even though we were more conservative with that document than they've been with DSM-5, with its many changes that are unsupported and, in some cases, quite reckless."" For example, Frances said DSM-5 would mislabel one in four people with chronic pain and irritable bowel syndrome with the DSM-5's newly created ""somatic symptom disorder,"" which is diagnosed when a person has spent at least six months steadily thinking of and being anxious about their medical illness. According to Frances and other like-minded critics, a confluence of related factors resulted in an ""over-medicalizing"" and over-diagnosis of mental illness. Chief among them, they contend, is that an increasing number of primary care and other nonpsychiatric doctors are dispensing anti-psychotic drugs, despite their lack of training in that area of medicine. Aggressive sales and marketing by pharmaceutical companies may also be driving the surge. Those factors, Montgomery said, were likely part of what was at play after her baby's stillbirth. ""I had no mental illness. I had never been medicated. I had not even suggested that I was depressed,"" she said. ""And I kept asking if anyone merely knew a therapist that I could go talk to about what was clearly a traumatic experience."" While Montgomery didn't require prescription medications, even DSM-5 protesters acknowledge that there are people whose disorders demand such intensive intervention, perhaps throughout their lifetime. Still, critics say the upcoming manual veers in the wrong direction. ""The DSM-5, in many ways, reflects the politics of psychiatry these days,"" said Dr. Joel Paris, author of ""Prescriptions for the Mind: A Critical View of Contemporary Psychiatry,"" a psychiatry professor at McGill University and researcher at Mortimer B. Davis-Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Quebec. ""Everybody has a kind of investment in certain diagnoses. Those who are studying a particular disorder often are saying, 'Well, this is much more common than you think they are. Oh, the prevalence is very high.' But we risk losing legitimacy because of over-diagnosis. ... The fact is that most people get by with bad patches in their lives. They recover.""

"(CNN) -- Pop. Pop. Pop. What is that, a number of passengers at Los Angeles International Airport thought? Then came the screams from inside Terminal 3: ""A gun! Everybody get down."" By the time the shooting stopped Friday morning, a lone gunman had squeezed off 10 rounds from an assault rifle, according to authorities, killing at least one person and wounding others. Hours later, with a wounded suspect -- identified by authorities as Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, of Los Angeles, in custody -- those who survived the shooting rampage painted a terrifying picture of how the attack unfolded: . 'Everybody get down' It was 9:20 a.m. inside the crowded terminal that serves Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines, Virgin America, Frontier Airlines and a number of other commercial carriers. Dana Starfield was one of the hundreds of passenger waiting to clear security or board flights when the gunman, according to police, walked into the terminal, pulled an assault rifle from a bag and starting firing. Then she heard a ""boom."" ""We heard someone scream, 'A gun! Everybody get down, get down,'"" Starfield told CNN affiliate KCBS. Many, including Starfield, had cleared one TSA checkpoint, where her ID and boarding pass were checked. She and others dropped to ground, near the security checkpoint. ""We just crawled through the security gate,"" she said. Starfield said Virgin America employees guided her and several others into a small room, where they barricaded the door by moving a copy machine in front of it. ""We heard a few more booms,"" she said. About 15 minutes later, she estimates, Los Angeles police SWAT officers came through and led them to safety. Number of guns discovered in airport rising, TSA figures show . The scariest part . Inside the airport, the gunman breached security after shooting and killing a TSA security officer and wounding others, and passengers scrambled to find safety. Leslie Rockitter was in the women's bathroom inside the terminal when she heard the shots. Suddenly, men and women were running into the bathroom seeking cover, she told CNN. More than two dozen people huddled in the bathroom, many of them ducking into stalls -- doing anything to hide. The scariest part, Rockitter told CNN, was when they heard shots ringing out in the terminal. ""That brief moment, you just had your life flash before you,"" she said. Even after the initial burst of gunfire, she and the others remained in the bathroom for fears there may be a second shooter. After about 40 minutes, they were finally let out. ""He said, 'TSA?'"" Passenger Leon Saryan was reaching for his shoes and belt that he had taken off to clear the TSA security checkpoint when he heard shots. ""Everybody kind of hit the ground and started to run,"" Saryan said on CNN's AC360. A TSA officer told him to ""grab my stuff and go."" But then the officer noticed Saryan, who was on the floor, didn't have his shoes. ""He grabbed the shoes, and the two of us started running down the corridor toward the gates,"" Saryan said. That's when the gunman shot the TSA officer, Saryan said. ""He got a grazing wound."" Saryan hid in a corner and watched as the shooter ""calmly walking down the corridor"" toward him. ""He said, 'TSA?'"" Saryan said. ""I just shook my head, and he kept going."" What is that sound? Chuck Ocheret was at Gate 30 at Terminal 3, walking toward the food court, when he heard ""a couple of popping noises."" Initially, it didn't register to him and others near him that it was gunfire. ""It didn't sound like gunfire,"" he said. Then, he turned around. ""There was a stampede of people coming my way, and I realized something was ... wrong,"" Ocheret said. ""People were screaming, 'Run into the bathroom, get behind something,' "" he said. Ocheret picked up his carry-on bags and ran down a long corridor toward the ""point-of-no-return"" exit. ""It's a long run when you think you could have a crosshair on your back,"" he said. 'Getting knocked down' Alex Neumann was at a food court, waiting to travel to Miami, when he heard the shots. ""People were running and people getting knocked down. There was luggage everywhere,"" Neumann said. ""Mayhem is the best I can describe it."" Several police officers moved about the airport with guns drawn, he said. 'Hid underneath the plane' Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara, stars of the Discovery Channel's ""Mythbusters,"" were waiting for a flight to Delaware that had been delayed when they heard the shots and saw people start to run. ""It didn't register until everybody started, like, flying down the hallway and they were just jumping over chairs, jumping over people, hiding, and we were kind of trapped at the end of the terminal,"" Belleci told CNN. A security guard eventually opened an emergency door. ""We all piled out onto the tarmac, and just kind of a hid underneath the plane,"" Belleci said. While Belleci was on the tarmac, Imahara was locked down in the Virgin America first class lounge. ""Virgin promptly locked the lounge doors. About ten minutes later, LAPD armed with automatic weapons arrived to secure the area,"" Imahara wrote in a post on Twitter. Four hours later, the two men were still waiting to leave the airport. ""They're processing IDs. The main question is 'Did you see anything?' Been asked by 6 different (people),"" Imahara said on Twitter. Police, guns drawn . Actor Tim Daly was inside the Virgin America first class lounge waiting to board a flight to Philadelphia when he heard the initial shots. Less than a minute later, LAPD officers with guns drawn burst into the lounge, said Daly, best known for roles on the TV shows ""Wings"" and ""Private Practice."" ""That was pretty frightening when they burst in"" because at first no one knew who they were, Daly told CNN by telephone. Then officers herded everyone together to make sure there were ""no bad guys, I guess,"" he said. For about an hour, Daly and others waited to be evacuated. They did not know that just outside the lounge, near Gate 35 and 36, airport police shot the gunman, bringing to an end the rampage. ""As we were evacuated, we were told to be careful not to step in any blood or glass as that would be evidence,"" Daly said. ""We were evacuated in different directions, and I didn't see any of that."" But he did see a high-powered rifle on the ground along with three magazines, a pair of black shoes and a number of bags strewn across the floors. ""I can only assume that was what was used by the shooter,"" Daly said. Celebs give their accounts of LAX incident .

"A great many filmmakers â€” too many â€” use handheld cameras to evoke a sensation of raw, this is really happening immediacy. But director Paul Greengrass is unique. At a glance, his live-wire, ragged-camera method may seem overly familiar, but the way he employs it, that method is as expressive as the style of a superb novelist. The note of authenticity he strikes isn't just about how he holds the camera. It's about what the camera is shooting: Greengrass sets up and stages organically detailed situations that he then films as if he were making a documentary. He pioneered that method in ""Bloody Sunday"" (2002), his spectacular drama about the 1972 Northern Ireland massacre, and he carried it into his two Bourne films (making the most far-fetched espionage potboilers seem genuine) and, of course, into United 93, the galvanizing post-9/11 dramatization that let you feel like you were right on board that doomed plane. Greengrass keeps you off balance â€” he's a jittery poet of reality. And he proves that yet again in ""Captain Phillips,"" his suspensefully spiky thriller based on a shattering incident from April 2009, when the crew of a U.S. cargo ship, the MV Maersk Alabama, was held hostage for several days by a band of Somali pirates armed with machine guns. Early on, Greengrass echoes what he did in ""United 93,"" letting us peek separately into the lives of both the victims and their attackers before the vehicle in question takes off. Capt. Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), a veteran merchant mariner, still lives in his native New England, and he's a plainspoken family man full of anxiety about the economically bleak new world his kids are facing. When his wife (Catherine Keener) drops him off at the airport, we can see he reveres her. The film then cuts to Somalia, a land of dust and poverty, where the pirates are recruited for their mission as if they were migrant farmworkers lining up to be chosen for that day's labor. Greengrass doesn't have to fill in much about the violent, chaotic breakdown of Somalia to let us know that these men have little choice in life: Taking up arms to steal, or even to kill, is the central option their society has handed them. When the giant cargo liner rounds the Horn of Africa, Captain Phillips realizes he's in dangerous waters. A radar that detects the pirates as they zoom toward the ship on two motorboats gives you a sickening feeling. As soon as they climb aboard, evading the spray of water hoses that are the crew's only ''weapons,'' we know we're seeing a clash of two cultures: the privileged Western world, with its power and bounty (all symbolized by the vastness of that ship), and the desperate quarters of the Third World, locked outside the loop of technological progress and hope. One of the pirates, a young fellow named Muse, is played by Barkhad Abdi, who has the ravaged, bone-hungry face of a starving child all grown up. That face haunts the movie, and so does Abdi's extraordinary acting. Muse is ruthless, forlorn, street-smart, naive (he wants millions of dollars, even though there's only $30,000 on the ship), and even compassionate, all at the same time. In dramatic terms, he's the enemy, yet Abdi's performance inspires us to ask: How, in the modern world, did the violence Muse embodies become part of the family of man? Phillips must guard his crew, negotiate with the pirates, and keep his own fears in check, and Hanks acts with a minimalism that speaks volumes: We're wired into his every glance. Phillips sends the pirates on a wild goose chase throughout the massive ship, and Captain Phillips becomes a gripping life-or-death chess game: Who will survive? Who will outwit whom? But in the second half, when Phillips is forced to board an enclosed lifeboat along with the pirates, the film's suspense begins to ebb. It's not that Greengrass' electrifying style fails him. It's that the movie, tethered for close to an hour to the strategies and tensions aboard the lifeboat, keeps giving us things to observe, but maybe not so much to discover. Grade: B+ .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Early assessments by two aid agencies suggest that Vietnam looks set to escape the scale of death and devastation wrought by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. The typhoon made landfall early on Monday morning in northern Vietnam, packing winds of 120 kph (75 mph), before weakening to a tropical storm and heading to southern China. Haiyan has claimed up to 10,000 lives in the Philippines and flattened whole towns. The state-run Vietnam News Agency reported that five people had been killed. ""In general, we do not anticipate that the damage will be on the scale of Haiyan in the Philippines but there will be recovery needs,"" said Snigda Chakraborty, country manager of Catholic Relief Services Vietnam. ""The typhoon has really weakened but it also changed its direction to where communities were not that ready,"" she said. The typhoon, which had initially been forecast to hit central Vietnam, skirted the country's long coastline on Sunday before making landfall near Ha Long Bay, a popular tourist destination known for its limestone peaks that jut dramatically out of the Gulf of Tonkin. Authorities had evacuated more than 800,000 people from provinces and cities in the storm's path. Michael Annear, Vietnam country representative for the International Federation of the Red Cross, said the threat for heavy rain, flash floods and landslides remains as Haiyan moves into China. ""We're concerned about the rain that's predicted -- 200 mm to 300 mm -- across the northeast part of Vietnam,"" he said. ""Flooding and landslides are the biggest risks. Wind damage is also a risk though we have early reports that only 100 households were damaged."" China raised its highest ""red"" typhoon warning on Sunday, with southern Chinese provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong and the island of Hainan expected to be affected. Six people were confirmed missing on Sunday afternoon after their cargo vessel got lost in the South China Sea, Xinhua said. Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines on Friday but the extent of the damage and loss of life is still becoming clear.","Early assessments suggest Vietnam will avoid devastation wrought by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines .

"(CNN) -- One recent afternoon, Brianda Cabrera was helping her younger sister, Diana, with her math homework. Brianda, 23, is not only the eldest of three siblings, but for the past nine years she has also been their parent. The Cabreras, including Brianda, Diana, 15 and Jose, 18, are orphans. ""My parents are gone. For me, this is the only family I have left,"" Brianda said from their home in Sandy Springs, Georgia. Their father, Rafael Cabrera, died 13 years ago in Mexico. Unable to find a job in her home country to support her children, their mother, Alejandra Medrano, decided to move the family to the United States, where she had a sister living in Atlanta. But Medrano was struck by a car and killed in February 2005. She was 36 years old and Brianda was 14. The children went to live at their aunt's home, but the situation was less than ideal. ""It was chaotic,"" Brianda says. ""They had four kids of their own and it was three of us. A couple supporting all those kids ... it was very stressful for them."" Brianda began taking odd jobs to support the family. As soon as she turned 18, she decided to move out of her aunt's house with her two siblings. She became a parent and breadwinner even though she was barely making enough money to pay for food, rent and school. ""She's become a second mother and she took on responsibilities she didn't need to, to take care of us,"" Diana says through tears. In addition to living alone and being barely able to survive on what Brianda made, the Cabreras also faced another challenge: they were undocumented. Under the law, the Cabreras fell into a category known as ""unaccompanied minors,"" meaning undocumented immigrant children who have no parents or guardians in the United States. The number of unaccompanied minors in the country has tripled in the past five years, government statistics show. Last year, the U.S. Border Patrol took more than 24,481 into custody, compared with 8,041 in 2008. The vast majority in 2012 came from Mexico (13,974), but some came from places as far away as India (23), China (16) and Romania (16). Immigration attorney Jessica Daman says these statistics, compiled by the Border Patrol, may be only a fraction of the total. ""Obviously, that's just the children who are apprehended crossing the border; new arrivals in theory, so nationwide, who knows how many we have that weren't undetected, that crossed without detention?"" Daman, who works at Atlanta's Latin American Association, took the case of the Cabreras to court. ""We asked that the children be found deprived, under state law, and that she (Brianda) be named their guardian. With that order the youngest two children were eligible to apply for special immigrant juvenile status and a green card."" But what happens to children of undocumented immigrants when their parents or legal guardians die or are somehow missing or unavailable to care for their children? What happens to unaccompanied minors who enter the country illegally and get caught by immigration authorities? The Customs and Border Protection agency, under the Department of Homeland Security, turns these children over to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services within 48 hours of their detention. Through the Administration for Children and Families, DHHS cares for the children through a network of providers that offer foster care, group homes, shelters and residential treatment centers. The average stay in the system is 45 days and, according to DHHS, 88% of children are released to relatives already living in the United States. For now, the Cabreras can stay together. Brianda is focusing on the younger siblings' welfare and making sure they stay in school and take advantage of the opportunities this country offers. ""She's going to school and I know she expects us to go to school and she's made that possible by doing all these legal things,"" Diana says. Brianda is majoring in accounting at Kennesaw State University and working at an accountant's office to support her siblings. ""Family comes first, so that's the way I was raised that before anything else you have to take care of your family,"" she says. ""So I think that was the main thing. Now that my parents are gone I have to take care of my family because that's the only thing I have left."" The fight is not over. Brianda's fate depends on a bill for young immigrants known as ""the Dream Act."" But the legislation, officially known as Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors, has failed to pass multiple times in Congress. Brianda, however, says she wants to stay ""positive."" That's the only hope she has of keeping the family together. And she's embracing that hope.","Most undocumented immigrant children without parents in the U.S. came from Mexico .
The official statistics may represent just a fraction of the total number .
When apprehended, such children go into a network of caregivers ."
"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney is in a bind. He must present himself as a staunch conservative in order to appeal to skeptical right-wing voters in the Republican presidential primary, but if he plays it too conservative, he'll alienate moderate voters in the general election. Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom is not overly concerned, though. On Wednesday, he expressed confidence the campaign would hit the ""reset button"" after the nomination and redraw Romney as a moderate candidate. ""Everything changes,"" he explained on CNN, ""It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again."" Fehrnstrom's comparison of his boss' campaign to a toy tablet ignited a political firestorm. Internet wags imagined Mitt Romney as an Etch A Sketch drawing, while his primary opponents, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, gleefully brandished Etch A Sketches at campaign events. Romney rushed to contain the damage by promising to be a true conservative forever. It won't work. Fehrnstrom has accidentally stumbled on something profound. He may not have much experience with Etch A Sketch technology. With all due respect to that iconic American toy, its legendary reset abilities have never been quite up to scratch. Dark smudges tend to mar the perimeter of its silvery slate, and no matter how vigorously you shake the thing, you can never quite obliterate the residue. Even so, the real-life Etch A Sketch in all its splotchy glory actually offers a better metaphor for American politics than the fantasy of a clean post-primary slate. It's not that Fehrnstrom's contempt for the cognitive capabilities of the voters is entirely off the mark. The collective memory of the American electorate is notoriously short. Think you're smarter than the average voter? Identify the authors of these political promises: . • ""He won't streamline the federal government and change the way it works, cut 100,000 bureaucrats and put 100,000 new police officers on the streets of American cities, but I will."" • ""And after we fund important priorities in the ongoing operations of our government, I believe we ought to pay down national debt. And so my budget pays down a record $2 trillion in debt over the next 10 years."" • ""My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors and stay within the public financing system for the general election."" (Answers: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama) OK, maybe you're one of the smart ones, but most people would have to guess. That's why it's not very hard for presidential candidates to shift from primary promises that appeal to the base to general election proposals that appeal to moderates and independents. Even issues a few months old go rapidly stale when the pressure comes off. House Republicans have recently violated the historic debt deal they agreed to less than a year ago, gambling that voters won't hold them to it. They seem to be right. The media has barely covered the story; the public isn't interested. But American voters don't forget everything. Some words and ideas seem to permanently embed themselves in our collective psyche. Try identifying the authors of these quotes: . • ""Read my lips: no new taxes"" • ""I am not a crook."" • ""Tear down this wall."" • ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman."" Easy, right? George H. W. Bush, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton. How about this one? ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."" Most Americans probably remember very little about Vice President Dan Quayle, let alone Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, but this brief exchange during a vice-presidential debate was unforgettable. Pithy one-liners tend to fix themselves in our mental machinery far more easily than complex ideas. They capture a personality, a moment or an idea in a few compelling or amusing words. Apt labels and nicknames also tend to stick: Reagan the great communicator, Clinton the comeback kid, John McCain the maverick, John Kerry the flip-flopper. Once embedded in the great Etch A Sketch that is American political consciousness, these ideas cannot be shaken free for decades, sometimes even centuries. People still say, ""Tippecanoe and Tyler too"" some 170 years after the campaign slogan was coined, though few have any idea who it referred to or why. Time will tell which words and ideas endure from the 2012 presidential election, but Eric Fehrnstrom has offered us a prime candidate. The Etch A Sketch perfectly captures voters' perception of Mitt Romney as an opportunistic politician anxious to redraw himself according to the political requirements of the moment, a man who leans left in Massachusetts and right in Mississippi. The notion provokes the mistrust of conservatives, the cynicism of moderates and the amusement of liberals. Whether the label is fair is beside the point. Romney can defend his ideological consistency all year long. Nonetheless, when it comes to pithy words that stimulate the country's political imagination, you can shake and shake and shake, but you can never quite obliterate that residue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Wolraich.","Michael Wolraich: Etch A Sketch gaffe-turned-joke highlights bind Romney was already in .

"Gallman, Mississippi (CNN) -- A second man has been arrested in connection with the deaths of a Mississippi family found shot in the woods, a sheriff said Thursday. Cedric Mason is in the Copiah County, Mississippi, jail, accused in the killings of Atira Hughes-Smith, her 7-year-old son, Jaidon Hill, and her husband, Laterry Smith, Sheriff Harold Jones said. At the time of his arrest, Mason was on parole stemming from a marijuana possession conviction, according to the state parole board. The Jackson resident is eligible for ""flat time"" -- at which he'd have served 50% of his sentence -- in October 2017. Efforts by CNN on Thursday to reach Mason's family were unsuccessful. Jones said that he expects the 30-year-old Mason will be charged with murder. That had not been as of midday Thursday. He would join Timothy Burns, 42, who is charged with two counts of murder, for the deaths of Hughes-Smith and her son. There's some question as to whether Smith was killed in a different county, and that's why Burns doesn't now face three murder charges, explained the Copiah County sheriff. Wearing a bulletproof vest, Burns appeared Wednesday in Copiah County Justice Court. He said he had no lawyer, so one will be appointed to him. No bond was set. Jones has said that it's not known if Burns had anything against the three victims, nor if he even knew them. ""We don't think there is (a relationship),"" Jones said. ""But we haven't tied that loose end up yet."" The family was last seen Friday in a car that was later found flipped and on fire. The Copiah County sheriff said authorities now believe that Burns was driving that car when he got in an accident, and then set it ablaze. After finding the vehicle, investigators found bloody clothes belonging to the victims next to a gas station trash bin. Then their bodies were discovered in a wooded area, all had been shot to death, Jones said. In July: Mysterious Mississippi murder stokes suspicions bred by an ugly past . CNN's Gary Tuchman and Leah Smith reported from Gallman, Mississippi, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Dana Ford and Meridith Edwards contributed to this report.","Cedrick Mason is arrested, will likely be charged with murder, sheriff says .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- The uptick in violence in Iraq has prompted fears among Iraqi leaders and international powers that the tensions between Sunnis and Shiites could escalate further and threaten to burst into full-blown sectarian war. Who's killing whom? In some instances it's Iraqi security forces clashing with gunmen. In others cases it seems to be pure sectarian violence targeting the civilian population in easy to reach targets to cause maximum damage; to reignite divisions that never fully disappeared. Why is this violence escalating? After the U.S. military withdrawal, sectarianism began to re-emerge with a vengeance, plus al Qaeda in Iraq and various other groups are trying to re-establish themselves and there is fallout from what's happening in neighboring Syria. For those closely following what has been happening in Iraq, this is not a surprise. To a certain degree the Iraqi government and other parties have been trying to dial back these tensions, but some steps taken by the Iraqi government serve only to aggravate them. Tensions are higher now than they have been for years. Iraq's underlying problems have never been adequately addressed. There is a growing discontent within the Sunni minority and a growing number demonstrations against the predominantly Shia government. And it's all being aggravated by what's happening in Syria. What is the Syria Connection? There have been long tribal ties between Iraq's Sunni heartland and tribes in Syria. Those tribes feel they are being oppressed by Shias whether it's the government in Iraq or the Alawite sect of Shia to which Syria's President Bashar al-Assad belongs. In some ways both nations are proxy battlefields for a longtime power struggle between Saudi Arabia, with its Sunni majority, and Shia-ruled Iran and their respective allies. At the same time Iraq's Sunni population has its own legitimate reasons for demonstrating against the government which have nothing to do with what is happening in Syria. That being said, the conflict in Syria is throwing more fuel into an already burning fire. What is the state of the Iraqi security forces? Despite all the training they received from the U.S. military they are still largely not properly trained to deal with the multi-layered challenges they face. Additionally, Iraqi security forces are viewed by some as abusing their power; viewed not as a national force protecting the country but as a force protecting the Shia government. And it doesn't help that when driving through Baghdad you see Shia paraphernalia on the security checkpoints. There have been accusations of security forces targeting the Sunni population. Groups like Human Rights Watch accused the Iraqi security forces of abusing their power and using too much force to quell Sunni protests. What are the dynamics between Iraq's Sunni and Shia populations? To simplify an incredibly complex situation some Sunnis enjoyed a number of advantages under Saddam Hussein, which have completely slipped away during the rise of the Shia-led government. To Iraq's detriment, the government from the onset was built upon religious identity -- sectarianism -- and has failed to develop into a nationalistic entity. Iraq, which over the last decades has seen itself ripped apart, has yet to forge its own identity as a nation. Today the country is -- as the U.N. representative to Iraq recently put it -- at a crossroads.","Latest violence has led to fears of sectarian war in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Nine women, a bold proposal and a $1 bill. That was what it took for women's tennis to begin a 40-year journey of self-empowerment that has created a generation of sporting millionaires. Back in 1971, the total prize money on offer for the first women's tour was $309,000 spread over 19 tournaments. In 2012, including the purse from the four grand slams, it cracked $100 million for the first time -- this year it is projected to hit $107 million. ""I forecast to the athletes in my first player meeting that we would get to $100 million in 2014. To be able to reach that milestone two years ahead of that is testament to the commercial success of women's tennis,"" says Stacey Allaster, who has been chief executive of the WTA since 2009. When Serena Williams, the modern queen of the WTA Tour, won the U.S. Open last September her $2 million prize haul matched the entire career earnings of Billie Jean King -- one of the pioneering nine and a dedicated fighter in the cause of women's equality. ""I think they're truly proud of how far women's tennis has come from the $1 contract to the $100 million generation,"" Allaster told CNN. ""Meeting the original nine and spending time with them this past April in Charleston was inspirational. ""To hear their stories and what they had to go through to stand up to the establishment and take the risk for something they believed in was amazing."" King was one of the players frustrated by a lack of parity with the men's game in her era, when women struggled to find enough tournaments to play in -- let alone be paid on equal terms. Defying the U.S. Tennis Association, she set up a rebel tour with the help of publisher Gladys Heldman, who proffered the symbolic $1 contracts for the players. It was a schism that led to the formation of the establishment-approved Women's Tennis Association in 1973 -- which will be marked this year by the WTA's ""40 Love"" commemorative campaign, a celebration of four decades of progress in the women's game. It was the start of a circuit that now covers the globe. This year's schedule began with simultaneous events in China, Australia and New Zealand, and will climax with the season-ending championships in Turkey in late October. The 2012 Istanbul showpiece attracted the event's biggest crowds for 12 years, in a country not known for its tennis heritage, while China will host a fifth WTA tournament from 2014. ""We are obviously seeing extensive growth in our Asia-Pacific territory and in China. We are looking at how we take the next quantum leap,"" said Allaster. ""We are making sure that at the end of the day we have a circuit structure that can consistently deliver to our top events, because that's how we're going to drive the business, to deliver to sponsors and broadcasters."" And it is becoming a very big business. King was the first woman to earn six figures in a season, back in 1971. Last year world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka and Williams both became the first to break the $7 million barrier. In the men's game, only Novak Djokovic ($12.8 million) and Roger Federer ($8.6 million) earned more on court. The brand of women's tennis has been driven by the WTA's ""Strong is Beautiful"" campaign, which depicts the players both as athletes and style icons -- along with celebrity endorsers such as singers Aretha Franklin and Kelly Rowland, actress Susan Sarandon and businessmen Donald Trump and Richard Branson (see pictures in the gallery above, courtesy the WTA Tour). ""We're marketing the players as the world's strongest female athletes,"" Allaster said. ""We do have this duality of the off-court lifestyle and entertainment part of it, premium and glamorous. Strong confident women who have endured intense battles to be at the top of their game and be the best in the world."" While other women's sports, such as golf, have struggled to maintain lucrative sponsorships, tennis is bucking the trend. ""It is very important to stress that women, both in terms of prize money and in terms of commercial incomes in tennis and other sports, are the poor relations compared to men,"" says sports business expert Simon Chadwick. ""The women who earn significant revenue often fit a specific sociocultural stereotype."" Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Britain's Coventry University Business School, cites the examples of Maria Sharapova and Anna Kournikova -- Russians who capitalized on both their good looks and playing skills to become two of the most wealthy and high-profile women's players. Chadwick says that while the gap between men's and women's pay is closing in tennis, the sport is also becoming more global -- which increases its value for sponsors and commercial partners. ""Further, I think female tennis player brands embody a particular set of qualities, such as strength, power, beauty, success, that some brands find appealing because it enables them to target specific consumer groups, thus strengthening perceptions of their brands -- for which corporations are prepared to pay,"" he told CNN. ""The fact that some of the recently successful players, such as Li Na, are from growing or strong economies, has been helpful in drawing in new revenue streams to the sport from sponsors and commercial partners that previously may not have had an involvement in tennis."" While Sharapova and the Williams sisters have their own off-court business empires, the WTA actively helps players establish their own brands. ""One of our competitive advantages is that we have so many compelling individual stories,"" Allaster said. ""Our team is there to help develop their brand plans. Some of them have agents who do that, others don't -- that's where the campaign helps. What's most important is that they be themselves."" The WTA Tour has not always been in such a healthy situation. When Allaster joined in 2006, having made her name at Tennis Canada as a reviver of struggling tournaments, she faced a situation where players were complaining of burnout. ""We needed radical change. The bottom line was at the top tournaments players weren't consistently showing up, and that was impacting our credibility -- media were talking about it, sponsors were questioning 'are they really going to show?' "" she said. As part of its ""Roadmap reform,"" the WTA cut the number of top-level events players had to enter from 26 to 20. It's now 22, and prize money is up 51%. ""We had grown and grown and grown, there was no shortage of people wanting to do WTA tournaments -- if anyone raised a hand, we said come on. But there's only so many top-10 players,"" Allaster said. ""The intensity of their play through that period just escalated and their bodies were breaking down. We knew we had a commitment system that couldn't work."" In the 1990s the women's game was invaded by girls in their early teens, such as Martina Hingis and Kournikova, whose stars burned brightly but comparatively briefly. More recently top players such as Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin retired twice each before they were 30. Both battled with injuries at the end of their careers. In view of these issues, the WTA's emphasis is now on prolonging the careers of marquee players such as the Williams sisters. Both have been selective about their playing schedule as they have battled back from injuries and serious illnesses, though Serena has not opted out of the tournament commitment system -- which, under WTA rules, she could do as a top-10 player over the age of 30. ""We've been able to take the average career length from 12 years to now 15 years. I'd rather have 15 years of a superstar than a couple of great years then injured,"" Allaster said. ""Both Serena and Venus are a gift to women's tennis. Venus is thinking long term and I know Serena is, along with others."" The WTA's pressing business goal is to find a replacement for main sponsor Sony, which concluded an eight-year partnership at the end of 2012. ""We'll get through that. I'd like to have it for 2013 but usually a sales cycle for a global multimillion-dollar sponsorship is 18-24 months, and we are 10 months into this,"" Allaster said. And if there is ever any hint of complacency about continuing the WTA's success, Allaster will remind the players of the words of that pioneering nine. ""They're proud of women's tennis and proud of our success. A couple of them looked at me poignantly and said 'Don't let them catch us.' We didn't work this hard for women's tennis not to be No. 1.""","Prize money on offer to women's tennis stars will be higher than ever in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- When a gunman opened fire at a sprawling New Jersey mall, sheer panic erupted. Shoppers begged police officers to rescue them while others whispered into phones, terrified the gunman was nearby. 911 tapes released Wednesday tell of fast-spreading fear among shoppers as a gunman fired Monday night. Shortly after, he fatally shot himself. ""There's somebody shooting!"" a voice screeches in the 911 tapes released by the Bergen County Police Department. The tapes were obtained by CNN affiliate, WABC. ""I'm scared and I want to get out the mall,"" another caller told dispatchers. ""The cops, I can see the cops from the door ... is there any way you could reach one of the them and they could come in and get me?"" Others, scared the gunman was closing in, whispered to dispatchers. ""I don't hear any sirens here so please hurry."" More than 100 shoppers sought protection shortly after shots rang out. ""Somebody is shooting up Garden State Plaza right now, I am in the bathroom,"" one caller says. The gunman, Richard Shoop, later shot himself in the head, authorities say. There were no other casualties. Shoop's body was found early Tuesday in a back area of the mall hours after he fired at least six bullets without striking anyone in the massive shopping center. He acted alone, authorities say. ""We know that his intent was either suicide or to do something that would cause police to shoot him, which we call 'suicide by cop,' "" Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli told CNN's New Day. ""He had more than enough opportunity to be able to shoot other people, including a group adjacent to him, but he didn't,"" Molinelli said. ""Instead, he shot randomly at different locations."" Shots hit the ceiling, an escalator, an elevator and a storefront, the prosecutor said. The reasons for the shooting remain unclear. Shoop used narcotic drugs and sold drugs as well, Molinelli said. Shoop, dressed all in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet, walked through the mall with a rifle modified to look like an AK-47. The rifle was taken from his brother, according to Molinelli. His hometown of Teaneck held a vigil for him Tuesday night.","911 tapes tell of fast-spreading fear among shoppers .

"(CNN) -- Jeffery Watson napped in the comfort of a $2,500 presidential suite at Pittsburgh's stately Omni William Penn Hotel, which has hosted movie stars, leaders of industry, and every U.S. president from Theodore Roosevelt to Barack Obama. After Watson, 48 and homeless, was discovered Tuesday by guests who had rented the grand suite with crystal chandeliers and a grand piano, police escorted him to the Allegheny County Jail, where the decor is described in the jail's website as ""simple, sturdy and secure."" Charged with theft of services and criminal trespassing, Watson was jailed on $15,000 bond -- now resting in a cell with a narrow bunk with a thin nonflammable mattress, a sink, toilet and a narrow slit window, according to the jail's website. There was no immediate reaction from the guests who discovered Watson passed out in their suite of the 97-year-old hotel. The guests alerted hotel security, who woke Watson from his slumber on a couch and escorted him downstairs into police custody, police spokeswoman Diane Richard said. Watson told police he is from Los Angeles and had been trying to get back home. The homeless man told police he had been in Pittsburgh a few months, sleeping wherever ""he could rest his head."" It was unclear how long he had stayed in the suite. Eric DeStefano, the hotel's general manager, told CNN affiliate WTAE that Watson gained access to a parlor area used for receptions after a door was programmed to stay unlocked for an event. He said Watson has been banned from the Penn.","Homeless man is caught napping in Pittsburgh's stately Omni William Penn Hotel .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- The world is watching the situation in Syria transform before its eyes -- with an uptick in bombings and allegations of chemical weapons use -- but deciding what to do about it is no easy feat. In the capital, there is less shelling and fewer fighter jets are seen in the air than in the past, but the streets are as empty as ever in the wake of recent bombings. The increasing number of explosions is causing a lot of anxiety for Syrians, due in part to the fact that it's not clear which side is behind the blasts. The government blames ""terrorists,"" a designation that includes the rebels who are trying to bring down President Bashar al-Assad. The rebels accuse the government of bombing its own capital in a ploy for sympathy. ""They are all our children and it is sad. We are all Syrians killing each other,"" lamented Umm Wasim, who witnessed the latest tragedy: a bomb blast that killed at least 13 in Damascus Tuesday. Equally frustrating for the Syrian civilians who are waiting and hoping for international intervention in the crisis is the fact that the United States has now said there is evidence that the chemical weapon sarin has been used on a small scale in the conflict. It appears that a line has been crossed, but the response from the world community has not been swift. President Barack Obama said Tuesday the United States will wait until it has more details on the evidence of chemical weapons use before altering its strategy on the strife in Syria. Obama previously called the use of chemical weapons a ""red line,"" but the United States has not radically changed its approach to Syria in the days since an administration official announced the finding. The United States doesn't yet know ""how they were used, when they were used, who used them,"" Obama said. ""When I am making decisions about American national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapons use, I have to make sure I have the facts."" On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army said that the rebels had secured what they believe is an unexploded chemical weapon deployed by the regime in Idlib. The FSA will try to get the unexploded canister out of the country for testing, he said. ""If the Syrian regime doesn't want to allow the U.N. investigation team in, we will do all we can in order to present the evidence to the international community because we have the moral and national obligations to our people and our nation,"" Louay Almokdad said. At the scene of Tuesday's bombing in the capital, some people burst into tears as they spoke about the event and the general situation in Syria. ""They are killing our people. Washington and the West know they are terrorists. Why are they providing them with weapons?"" asked Mohammed Agha. But the United States says it provides only non-lethal aid to the opposition. The question of arming the rebels is being debated among the international community. Syrian state-run television said the ""terrorist explosion"" also wounded 70 people. The blast apparently came from a car bomb parked behind the old building of the Interior Ministry, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Syrian Observatory, which opposes al-Assad's government, said the number of casualties is expected to rise because of the large number of injured. Prime minister uninjured after bomb targets motorcade . Members of the Syrian armed forces were among those hurt in the explosion, the group said. But Almokdad told CNN he believes the attack was staged by the government. ""The latest blasts are nothing but a farce staged by the Assad regime in order to beg for sympathy from the international community on the eve of the U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the use of chemical weapons by the regime armed forces against our innocent civilians,"" the FSA spokesman said. He also said the rebel army was not involved in the explosion. ""Setting up car bombs in the capital or anywhere in the country is not a strategy that the FSA condones,"" Almokdad said. ""We reject targeting any civilian area and risking the lives of our civilian population."" Syrian rebels attack military airports across country, opposition says . Tuesday's blast occurred a day after Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi survived a bombing that targeted his motorcade in an upscale Damascus neighborhood, the government and opposition reported. The Syrian Observatory said one of al-Halqi's escorts and five civilians were killed in the explosion. Another escort and a driver were badly injured, the group said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported casualties but did not elaborate on the incident. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Monday blast. But the rebel spokesman said he believes that attack was also set up by the government. ""Al-Halqi is a minor figure propped by the al-Assad regime, and he is not a strategic target to the FSA or anyone in the revolution. We actually feel sorry for the man who was appointed to be a prime minister,"" he said. The Syrian civil war has pitted al-Assad's forces against rebels seeking an end to four decades of Assad family rule. More than 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the conflict in the past two years. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reported from Damascus, with Mariano Castillo reporting and writing from Atlanta. CNN's Saad Abedine and Holly Yan also contributed to this report.","Obama says more information is needed before a decision on Syria .

"(CNN) -- For centuries, the Vatican has required celibacy from its priests. It is a vow the Catholic Church says not only underscores the commitment of seminarians to their vocation but also is a model of Christ's own celibacy. But with the election of a new pope, many church watchers are wondering whether church teachings could change to allow all priests to marry. Abuse victims' group names preferred picks for new pope . Currently, the Vatican allows married Anglican priests who join the Catholic Church to become ordained as priests. Young Catholic seminarians, meanwhile, must remain celibate, and church leadership seems unlikely to move on the issue. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that while changes to church law on celibacy might be discussed, it is unlikely to change soon. ""It startles me sometimes (when people) say why doesn't the church talk about married priests,"" he said. ""I think we talk about it; I can't get my hair cut without my barber asking me about it. (But) I don't think there would be that kind of change. ""For a pope, the mission statement is to conserve in the best sense of the word ... preserve the spiritual patrimony of the church, the timeless teaching that's taught to us from Jesus to his apostles through 2,000 years of the Church. ""Now that doesn't mean he might not change the way it's presented."" Follow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter . For the Vatican, the debate on celibacy is nothing new; it has been going on in various forms since the Reformation of the 16th century -- but the past 50 years has put new pressures on the priesthood. The Vatican reaffirmed its commitment to continuing the practice at the height of the social and sexual revolution of the 1960s. In 1967, Pope Paul VI, who charted the Catholic Church through the difficult shoals of the cultural upheavals of the 1960s, published an encyclical, or open letter to the church, entitled Sacerdotalis Caelibatus (Latin for ""Of the celibate priesthood""). In it, he outlined the reasons for keeping the tradition of celibacy a part of church teaching: it was a superior way of achieving grace, it freed priests from familial obligations in order to devote themselves to God, it mirrored heaven as a place without marriage. Smoke signals: How is a new pope elected? ""In any case, the church of the West cannot weaken her faithful observance of her own tradition,"" Pope Paul VI wrote at the time. Britain's most senior Roman Catholic, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, told the BBC in February that many priests struggle to cope with celibacy and should be able to marry and have a family. Just three days later he was forced to resign over allegations of a 30-year-old sex scandal with seminarians in his charge. O'Brien later admitted his conduct had ""fallen below the standards"" expected of a priest. ""I'd be very happy if others had the opportunity of considering whether or not they could or should be married. It's a free world and I realize many priests have found it very difficult to cope with celibacy as they lived out their priesthood, and felt the need of a companion, of a woman, to whom they could get married and raise a family,"" he told the British news agency. O'Brien is not the first or the highest ranked Catholic to question the tradition of priestly celibacy. In 1993, at a weekly audience, even Pope John Paul II said celibacy did ""not belong to the essence of the priesthood."" Even so, he qualified this, saying there was ""no doubt about its suitability and indeed its appropriateness to the demands of sacred orders."" Celibacy in the Catholic Church is a law, not a doctrine, and can be changed by the pope at any time. Despite this, Pope Benedict XVI made it clear during his tenure that the traditional practice was unlikely to change. The Rev. Joseph Fessio, founder and editor of the U.S.-based conservative Catholic publishing house Ignatius Press, told Boston's The Good Catholic Life radio in February that while celibacy is a discipline and not a dogma, it made it no less an important part of the Catholic Church. ""People say celibacy is only a discipline, but it's not only a discipline,"" he told the radio program. ""It's something the church in its wisdom for 2000 years has recognized as a closer, more exact, more profound following of the example Jesus set us."" CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories . In the meantime, the arguments against celibacy have been mounting. Opponents argue that Jesus did not require celibacy from his apostles, that sexual repression has led to the sex abuse scandals currently racking the church and that celibacy has been responsible for the dwindling numbers of young men taking up the vocation. Sister Chris Schenk of the Ohio-based Catholic reform movement Futurechurch believes that celibacy should be made optional. ""Around the world there is a severe shortage of Catholic priests and over 50,000 churches have no pastor,"" she said. ""While the number of Catholics is rising, the number of priests is in decline -- mandatory celibacy can deter quality candidates from entering the priesthood. ""According to the Vatican yearbook, between 1975 and 2010 the world's Catholics increased by 59% from 709.6 million to 1.96 billion, but the number of priests increased only 1.8%. ""In 1975 there were 404,783 priests worldwide compared with 412,000 now. Forty-six percent of the world's priests are in Europe but only 24% of Catholics live there ... and the number is diminishing."" It seems her view may be supported by a majority of American Catholics. According to a survey of American Catholics by the Pew Research Center taken after Pope Benedict announced his resignation, 58% of congregants favored allowing priests to marry. Even so, the figures showed the divisive nature of the debate: Of those who attend Mass regularly, only 46% supported marriage for priests while 66% of those who attended less regularly supported marriage. What's in a name? Clues to be found in next pope's moniker . One former seminarian, who did not want to be named because he is still active in the church and not authorized to speak publicly, told CNN the vow of chastity was one of the chief reasons he dropped out of the vocation. ""I had strong issues with celibacy and, at that time, wanted the freedom to get married and didn't know why there could be Lutheran pastors that led perfectly normal family lives and also ran their congregations. ""I certainly understood the celibate side to priesthood and had a certain respect for it -- strangely I still do -- but I just felt that you should be given options."" He said the diocesan college he attended in the United States -- a type of minor seminary -- was designed to prepare students for their commitments at major seminaries if they decided to continue their studies. ""They were obviously making changes from the middle of the century -- in the '30s, '40s and '50s - when the seminaries were packed full, but probably after the whole peace revolution and the sexual revolution guys obviously started having a lot of second thoughts,"" he said. He said he saw little evidence of the kind of sexual abuses that have recently come to light and derailed the Catholic Church. ""When you're young, growing up in a big, serious Catholic family - and I went to a Catholic grade school, I was essentially raised, socialized and educated by nuns and priests - that has a very deep impact especially if they're good role models. ""I never had any sleazy nuns or priests when I was growing up, at least none that I knew about,"" he said. ""When you've got such good role models, both nuns and priests, who are celibate, that makes a big mark on you."" Possible papal contenders .","Celibacy in the Catholic priesthood still a contentious issue .

"(CNN) -- In trying to understand the mind of a man like Ariel Castro, accused of kidnapping, beating, and raping three young women held in captivity for almost 10 years, two things are important to keep in mind: (1) in human psychology, nothing occurs in a vacuum; and (2) the psychological profile that is emerging of this man is not rare. In fact, although Castro may be a more extreme example, there are aspects of his alleged pathology that are all too common. What I mean by the first item is that the clues to understanding Castro is to look at the totality of his adult functioning, and to look at his developmental years growing up. Read more: 'He is dead to me,' daughter of Ohio suspect says . The point is that the alleged monstrosity of his behaviors does not come out of thin air. We have only fragmentary evidence at this point, but many details will emerge in the coming days and weeks. And while it's impossible to psychoanalyze someone from a distance, there are plenty of clues in this case. We have reports that Castro was violent towards his common-in-law wife, Grimilda Figueroa, with whom he had three children. She reported to police that Castro ""broken petitioner's nose (twice), ribs, lacerations, knocked out tooth, blood clot on brain, (inoperable tumor), dislocated shoulder, (twice, once on each side) threatened to kill petitioner and daughters 3 to 4 times just this year."" Timeline: Three Cleveland girls go missing . The domestic violence protection order, filed on August 29, 2005, alleged that though Figueroa had full custody of their children, Castro, ""frequently abducts daughters and keeps them from mother/petitioner/ legal custodian."" Of note, at the time Castro has this Order of Protection filed against him is after he is alleged to have kidnapped his three victims and while he has them imprisoned. Men (who constitute 90% the cases) who are bent on the total control of a woman, using psychological and physical abuse, are termed batterers. Read more: Inside Cleveland's haunted house . The dimensions along which male batterers have been studied include the presence or absence of alcohol or drug abuse, whether or not the violence is intrafamilial or extends outside the family, the presence or absence of criminality, and the presence or absence of psychopathology, especially personality disorders. In Castro's case it may be as he got older, he progressed from predominantly intrafamilial violence to kidnapping adolescent girls whom he controlled through systematic physical and sexual violence. We don't know yet if drug or alcohol abuse played a role in promoting violent behaviors. But sociopathy appears to explain some of Castro's psychology. He seemed to have the sociopathic ""charm"" to drive up to adolescent females on the street and convince them to get into his car. Read more: Neighbor feels 'fooled' by Cleveland abduction suspect . He had the sociopathic instincts of how to psychologically terrorize, demoralize, and ""break down"" his victims with beatings chainings, rapes, and basement imprisonment. He seemed adept at the psychological torture of allowing his prisoners to watch city vigils highlighting their disappearances. He participated in these gatherings and vigils and even interacted with one of the victim's family members. His seeming ability to maintain a detached demeanor while present in the community suggests antisocial personality. So besides the concepts of batterers and sociopathy, what is striking in Castro's case is the degree of sexual sadism. Unfortunately, the systematic physical and sexual violence extending for years towards one's children, step-children, or spouse is something I hear every day in the histories of my patients admitted for treatment of severe alcohol or drug addiction. Case law records prosecutions of men charged with kidnapping women for hours or days at a time to sexually abuse them. But what is mindboggling in Castro's case is the breadth and depth of sexual violence he is accused of perpetrating against these three women. If he is charged for every assault and rape his victims report, he could receive thousands of charges. Where do people like Castro come from? Male batterers often grow up in families fraught with strife, conflict, neglect and violence. The basic theory is that deleterious early life experiences of the perpetrator cause developmental arrest of their psychological maturation and personality formation. This theory would predict that in the coming weeks and months details will emerge of the events in his early years that derailed Castro being able to develop a normal, healthy, mature adult ego. What happens is that the individual is left with deep emotional needs for which they feel totally inadequate to get met. Their self-concept is so impaired and their self-esteem is chronically so low that they feel totally unable to compete in the normal adult game of attracting and keeping a mate. When their attempts are met by failure, their impaired moral development and lack of empathy coupled with unbridled anger and rage lead them down the road of violent possession of their ""partners."" But even battering, sociopathy, and sexual sadism do not seem enough to explain the enormity of Castro's alleged crimes towards these three women. In fact, they suggest a more pervasive pathology such as a sadistic personality disorder -- currently a research category. His alleged violence towards vulnerable women was so extensive, repeated over so many years, extended beyond sexual violence and perversions, to alleged forced miscarriages, starvation, and other forms of behavioral control. We will need to brace ourselves as the investigations unfold and the true extent of the horrors that were committed at 2207 Seymour Avenue is revealed.

"(CNN) -- More than two years after an earthquake and tsunami brought disaster to a nuclear plant in eastern Japan, operators Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) announced plans Wednesday to begin the painstaking and dangerous process of removing fuel rods from a crippled reactor at the site. The procedure is considered a milestone in the estimated $50 billion cleanup of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. ""Fuel removal really means the start of decommissioning,"" plant chief Akira Ono said, according to Japan's Nikkei Shimbun. When the tsunami swamped the plant, located 149 miles (240 kilometers) north of Tokyo on Japan's eastern seaboard in March 2011, it cut the power to vital cooling systems for the three reactors in use at the time. This resulted in the second-worst nuclear accident in history -- after Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union in 1986 -- as the reactors melted down and leaked radioactive material into the atmosphere. The 'nuclear renaissance:' What went wrong? The Fukushima cleanup has been beset by numerous problems, including the leak of 300 tons of radioactive water from a storage tank. TEPCO will begin taking out 1,500 spent fuel units from Reactor 4 for storage in safer specially designed containers, the company says. The reactor building exploded in the aftermath of tsunami likely due to a build-up of hydrogen from a neighboring reactor, according to TEPCO. The cost of decontamination is estimated to be Â¥5 trillion (U.S.$50.7 billion) or more, Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun reported. After Fukushima: Could Germany's nuclear gamble backfire? Fallout continues for Tokyo on the Fukushima disaster. Earlier this week, China demanded an accurate assessment of cleanup efforts. ""China follows closely the countermeasures to be adopted by Japan. We urge the Japanese side to spare no effort in minimizing the subsequent impact of the accident and provide timely, comprehensive and accurate information to the international community,"" Wang Min, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said Tuesday at a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.","Plant operators will begin the delicate work of removing nuclear fuel from Fukushima .

"(CNN) -- A 27-year-old graphic designer has made history by becoming the first Saudi woman to conquer Mount Everest. Raha Moharrak reached the top of the mountain on Saturday as part of the ""Arabs with Altitude"" expedition, which also includes a Palestinian, an Iranian and a Qatari aiming to be the first from his nation to summit the mountain. The mountaineers' Twitter account, @EverestArabs, marked the occasion by tweeting: ""The first ever Saudi woman to attempt Everest has reached the top!! Bravo Raha Moharrak. We salute you."" ""I really don't care about being the first, so long as it inspires someone else to be the second,"" Moharrak, who lives in Dubai and in the Saudi port city of Jeddah, is quoted as saying on the expedition's website, Arabs on Top of the World.

Coming from a traditional and conservative family meant that ""convincing them to let her climb was as great a challenge as the mountain itself,"" according to her biography on the site, though they now fully support her efforts. ""We are all very proud of Raha's achievement but are awaiting for her safe return,"" Moharrak's brother Mohammed told CNN. The team -- made up of Moharrak, Qatari Sheikh Mohammed Al Thani, Palestinian Raed Zidan and Iranian Masoud Mohammad -- is aiming to raise $1 million to fund Reach Out to Asia's educational projects in Nepal.

"(CNN)  -- By now, unless you live under a boulder large enough to block data signals, you know that New York Rep. Anthony Weiner is embroiled in a scandal involving an extremely personal picture sent from his Twitter account to a Seattle college student. Weiner says his account was hacked, but can't say ""with certitude"" if the picture is a fake. This much we know. But what else does the story that has Washington all a-twitter reveal about everyone's favorite microblogging service? 1. Twitter is very effective at spreading the news, but it can't control it. For Twitter itself, the Weiner story couldn't have broken at a less appropriate time. The company's CEO, Dick Costolo, and a large portion of its PR team were hunkered down at the All Things Digital conference in beautiful Rancho Palos Verdes, California, preparing to launch -- of all things -- its new photo-sharing service. Costolo deftly batted away questions about Weiner with a ""no comment."" But for a company that is anxious to prove its maturity, talking about ways to share pictures on Twitter at a time when the most famous example of that is a lewd underwear snap could only have been frustrating. 2. Maybe this is a good time to launch Twitter photo-sharing after all. Reports emerged Thursday that the mysterious sender of that photo may well have exploited a security flaw in yFrog, a third-party photo-sharing service. The loophole would have allowed anyone to send a picture from Weiner's account using tools no more advanced than e-mail. YFrog has since disabled the e-mail feature. Still, that's a strong argument for sharing photos directly and securely from your Twitter account -- which is exactly what Twitter is launching. 3. Checking Twitter on a Friday night is the new normal. College student Gennette Cordova, recipient of the offending tweet, wrote for the New York Daily News that she first learned about it when logging into Twitter on a Friday night. If you think that's unusual activity for a co-ed on a Friday night, get with the 21st century. A dozen of Cordova's friends had already seen the Weiner tweet, she wrote. According to Twitter tracking firm Sysomos, Friday is the third-biggest day of the week for tweeting (after Tuesday and Wednesday.) Social media, it seems, is how we like to relax after hitting the books. 4. Account hacking is more common than you might think. If it turns out Weiner's account was hacked, he can take comfort in one thing: It happened to one of his main detractors, Fox News, too. In 2009, followers of the network's official Twitter feed were puzzled to see a tweet about host Bill O'Reilly's sexual orientation, the result of an 18-year-old hacker called GMZ uncovering the account's password. Fox News was only the first in a series of GMZ attacks on Twitter accounts including those of Britney Spears, Facebook, the Huffington Post, and Barack Obama himself. Little more than a year later, hundreds of accounts -- including the one owned by tech pundit John C. Dvorak -- were hacked by a spammer looking to advertise a weight-loss product. 5. There are plenty of things you can do to keep your account secure. Twitter has spent years beefing up its security and dishing out advice on how you can help. The top tips: Use a strong password with numbers and unusual characters; use the more secure URL ""https://twitter.com/""; be wary of links and e-mail phishing scammers that pretend to be Twitter employees asking for your password. 6. Always double-check the person you're tweeting. Gennette Cordova's take on why Weiner, whom she doesn't know, may have tweeted at her? Because her name is alphabetically close to that of Ginger Lee, a Tennessee exotic dancer that Weiner also followed on Twitter until recently. It's entirely possible, given that Twitter auto-suggests who you might be trying to reach once you start typing their names. One false click, and that racy message intended for your spouse may be winging its way to your mom instead. 7. Washington may be obsessed with Weiner, but Twitter users have already moved on. You might expect the Twitter hashtag that denotes the scandal, ""#Weinergate"", to be popular right now. But you'd be wrong. It isn't even in the top 10. Beltway pundits and politicians may be talking about little else, but Twitter's 200 million users have other things on their minds. The top trending hashtags in the U.S. Friday morning? ""#myperfectmorning"" and ""DunkinDonuts."" 8. Social media can bring unwanted attention -- but mostly from old media. Another sign that Twitter users care little about the scandal: As of Friday, Cordova's account was being followed by less than 800 people. Compare that to Sohaib Athar, the tweeter who first noticed the Seal Team 6 raid on Abottabad that killed Osama Bin Laden. Athar's sudden fame gained him roughly 100,000 new followers. Cordova's biggest beef isn't with anyone on Twitter -- it's with the New York Post, which she alleges wrangled an interview out of her under false pretenses. 9. Social media is really hard to quit. Weiner may be done talking about the scandal to reporters, but he hasn't stopped tweeting. Cordova's initial response to the scandal was to disable her accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and the question-and-answer social site Formspring. Within days, however, she was back and tweeting up a storm. Her new tagline? ""I can't believe I'm back on Twitter."" As fellow social media addicts, we here at Mashable.com understand perfectly.","Twitter is very effective at spreading the news, but not as good at controlling it .

"(CNN) -- A federal investigation found that the New Orleans Police Department has engaged in patterns of misconduct in violation of the Constitution and federal law, the Justice Department announced Thursday. Among the findings are that the police department has used excessive force, made unconstitutional stops and searches, and illegally profiled people based on race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. The investigation also found a number of practices that contributed to the illegal conduct, including failed systems for recruiting and promoting officers, poor training and lack of supervision, among others. ""Today is both a day for concern and hope,"" U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole said. Many of the New Orleans officers carry out their jobs well, he said, but ""unfortunately, our conclusions reveal that many New Orleans police officers have failed to live up to what we rightfully expect from our law enforcement people."" Police Superintendent Ronal W. Serpas said his department is ""completely embracing"" the report. ""I believe there is no question that this plan will catapult our department,"" he said. The investigation was announced last year, when the newly elected mayor, Mitch Landrieu, asked the Justice Department to review the city's embattled police department just two days after taking office. In a May 2010 letter sent to Attorney General Eric Holder, Landrieu asks for a team from the department's civil rights division to help the city address and prevent police misconduct. ""I have inherited a police force that has been described by many as one of the worst police departments in the country,"" Landrieu said in the letter. ""It is clear that nothing short of a complete transformation is necessary and essential to ensure safety for the citizens of New Orleans,"" it said. ""The police force, the community, our citizens are desperate for positive change."" Within his first week in office, Landrieu also announced he had tapped Serpas -- a New Orleans native who was then police chief in Nashville and had a track record of reducing violent crime -- as the city's new police superintendent to lead reforms. The investigation was not related to any ongoing federal criminal prosecutions of officers, officials said. Federal prosecutors have investigated several New Orleans police officers involved in a shooting on the Danziger Bridge four days after Hurricane Katrina roared ashore in 2005. Two civilians were killed in that shooting -- a 19-year-old man and a severely disabled 40-year-old man. Four people were hurt. Former city police officer Robert Barrios pleaded guilty in federal court in April 2010 to a charge he failed to report a cover-up of the shooting. His plea came after guilty pleas related to the incident from three other former New Orleans police officers: Michael Lohman, Jeffrey Lehrmann and Michael Hunter. As a result of the findings of the current federal investigation, the Justice Department will work with the New Orleans police to develop new policies and training for its officers. The police department must implement a new way of working that ensures accountability, work closer with the community and restore confidence in the department, the Justice Department said. ""Today's findings should serve as a foundation not only to rebuild the police department but to help restore the community's trust in fair, just and effective law enforcement,"" Cole said. The investigation was carried out with the support of the mayor and the police superintendent. ""Our investigation has shown that the problems and challenges confronting the NOPD are serious, wide-ranging, systemic and deeply rooted in the culture of the department,"" said Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. For example, investigators found that officers ""regularly used excessive force as retaliation"" but that in six years, not one officer-involved shooting violated policy. In some cases, there were attempts to prevent the prosecution of officers, Perez said. They also found that officers did not know the law regarding legal stops, searches and arrests. The system at the police department favored quantity of arrests over quality, Perez said. ""Our next step will be to work with the (police) department to develop a consent decree, which will involve federal oversight,"" he said. Perez said as part of that consent decree, benchmarks will be established to make sure the police department is improving. He said the benchmarks will address areas such as racial profiling and use of force. Investigators also found regular harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, he said. Investigations of city police by the Justice Department are not uncommon, but cities themselves rarely initiate them, Merrick Bobb, executive director of the Police Assessment Resource Center in Los Angeles, told CNN when the New Orleans probe was launched last year. District of Columbia officials took a similar approach in 1999 when they asked the Justice Department to investigate whether city police were using excessive force, he said.","New Orleans Police Department is found to be violating Constitution and federal law .
Officers lack proper training and supervision, officials say .
Many department practices are said to contribute to poor conduct .

"Rome (CNN) -- In front of rapt crowds, Pope Benedict XVI spoke of moments of struggle as well as joy Wednesday during his final public address from a stage set up in St. Peter's Square. In an unusually personal message, he said there had been ""many days of sunshine"" but also ""times when the water was rough ... and the Lord seemed to sleep."" Interactive: Where does the pope live? But even as the church passes through stormy seas, God will ""not let her sink,"" he added, in what was his final general audience before he steps down Thursday evening. Those words will be seen by many as a comment on the series of child sex abuse scandals and corruption claims that have rocked the Roman Catholic Church in the course of his pontificate. Benedict recounted how when he was asked to be pope eight years ago, he had prayed for God's guidance and had felt his presence ""every day"" since. ""It was a part of the journey of the church that has had moments of joy and light, but also moments that were not easy,"" he said. Vatican reveals Pope Benedict's new title . 'Tough choices' Dressed all in white and looking serene, the pope used his last general audience to call for a renewal of faith and speak of his own spiritual journey through eight years as leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. Benedict thanked the cardinals, the clergy in Rome, Vatican officials and priests worldwide for their work, as well as their congregations, saying ""the heart of a pope extends to the whole world."" Knowing his strength was fading, he had taken the step of resignation well aware of its gravity and novelty, but also ""with a deep peace of mind,"" he said. ""Loving the church also means having the courage to make tough choices,"" he said, as he called on the faithful to pray for him and the new pope. Benedict gave an insight into the life of the pontiff, describing it as without any kind of privacy, with his time devoted entirely to the church -- perhaps particularly difficult for a man known for his love of scholarship. His life in retirement will be ""simply a return to the private place. My decision is to forgo the exercise of active ministry, not revoke it. In order to return to private life, not to a life of travel, meetings, receptions, conferences and so on,"" he said. As he finished, cheers erupted from the tens of thousands gathered in the square -- acknowledged by Benedict with an open-armed embrace. 'Support and love' Vatican officials said 50,000 tickets had been handed out for Benedict's last general audience -- but authorities said they had prepared for as many as 200,000 people to show up to witness the historic moment in person. The pope in retirement: What to expect . Benedict, who spoke first in Italian, also gave greetings in French, German and English, among other languages, reflecting the church's global reach. CNN iReporter Joel Camaya, a priest from the Philippines who is studying in Rome, said it was very moving to be among those gathered in the huge plaza. Waves of applause rose up to meet Benedict, especially when he addressed the pilgrims in different languages. ""I really felt all the support and all the love, the prayers, from those who were present,"" he said. After the pope left, people's mood was festive, with many chatting or singing, Camaya said, but at the same time nostalgic because it's the last time they will hear Benedict speak. ""Especially for people who have got used coming here for the audience and for the (Sunday) Angelus, it's something to be missed,"" he said. Those lucky enough to have tickets for the final audience listened from seats in front of St. Peter's Basilica. Among them were many of the Roman Catholic Church's senior clergy. Others packed around the edges of the square and surrounding side streets, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pontiff. Among the crowds were groups of pilgrims who had traveled to Rome for the special occasion, as well as local residents and curious visitors keen to share in the moment. Opinion: Benedict a pope aware of his flaws . Benedict arrived and left in his Popemobile, allowing him to pass close by many people in St. Peter's Square. Standing in the glass-topped vehicle, flanked by security, he waved as he slowly made his way along pathways through the crowds. Some waved flags and banners as they stood under cold but clear skies. Normally in winter, the pope would give his weekly Wednesday general audience inside a hall within Vatican City, but the event was moved outside because of the anticipated huge crowds. Pontiff emeritus . The pope didn't give the usual brief personal greetings to people afterward, but was to meet with delegations of heads of state in Vatican City. Benedict, who stunned the world's Catholics when he announced his resignation just over two weeks ago, will leave office at 8 p.m. local time Thursday. At that point, a transition period will begin, as around 115 cardinals gather in Rome to pick a successor in a secretive election known as a conclave. The Vatican has been rewriting the rules to cope with an almost unprecedented situation -- Benedict is the first pope to resign in nearly 600 years. He will meet with the cardinals Wednesday and Thursday, before being flown by helicopter to the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo. Pope to resign: Your thoughts . There, from a balcony, he will greet crowds one last time before his resignation takes effect and the Swiss Guards, who by tradition protect the pope, ceremonially leave the residence's gate. More details were given Tuesday of how the 85-year-old's life in retirement will play out. He will keep the papal title Benedict XVI, rather than reverting to the name Joseph Ratzinger, and will be referred to as ""his holiness,"" said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman. He will also go by the title his holiness ""pontiff emeritus"" or ""pope emeritus."" Interference fears . Living out of the public eye in a small monastery within Vatican City, Benedict will wear a simple white robe, without the papal red cape, and will swap his red shoes for brown ones. He is expected to devote his time to prayer and study. Catholic author Michael Walsh told CNN he was unsurprised by Benedict's desire for more privacy. ""He's a rather private man. He wants to get back to his books and his cats, he wants to get back to prayer,"" he said. ""He's obviously coming towards the end of his life -- he's 85 -- so I understand that."" But, Walsh added, ""what I don't understand is that he says he wants to be part of it all, which could be disastrous if you take it at face value,"" referring to Benedict's promise not to abandon the church. ""The notion that you have two people that claim to be pope, in a sense, is really going to be very confusing,"" Walsh said. Vatican officials have said they don't anticipate any interference from Benedict as a new pope takes office. However, his influence will be felt in as much as he appointed 67 of the cardinals who will enter the conclave. Whoever his successor may be will have plenty on his plate, from allegations swirling in the Italian media that gay clergy may have made themselves vulnerable to blackmail by male prostitutes -- a claim forcefully denied by the Vatican -- to the festering issue of the church's handling of child abuse by priests. Scandal flared again over the weekend, as Scotland's Roman Catholic archbishop was accused in a UK newspaper report of ""inappropriate behavior"" with priests. Cardinal Keith O'Brien, who contests the allegations, resigned Monday and said he would not attend the conclave. The Most Rev. Philip Tartaglia, archbishop of Glasgow, will take his place until a new archbishop is appointed, the Vatican said Wednesday. ""These are painful and distressing times,"" Tartaglia is quoted as saying. The Vatican said Monday that a report by three cardinals into leaks of secret Vatican documents, ordered by Benedict last year and seen only by him, would be passed on to the new pontiff. Opinion: How next pope must tackle child sex abuse . Cardinals' conclave . Meanwhile, the cardinals who must elect the new pope are already gathering in Rome, Lombardi said. The dean cardinal will on Friday summon the cardinals to a general congregation, Lombardi said. That could come as soon as Monday, although the date is not yet fixed. The cardinal-electors will then decide exactly when to hold the conclave, during which they will select a peer via paper ballot. The voting process will end when only when one cardinal gains two-thirds support. After his resignation, Benedict, who cited the frailty of age as the reason he resigned, will no longer use the Fisherman's Ring, the symbol of the pope, Lombardi said. The ring will be destroyed, along with Benedict's papal seal, after his departure from office. Smoke signals: How is a new pope elected? CNN's Barbie Latza Nadeau reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. Vatican correspondent John Allen and Sarah Brown contributed to this report.","Benedict XVI says there were ""times when the Lord seemed to sleep"" in past 8 years .

"Bali, Indonesia (CNN) -- President Barack Obama took part Friday in the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) economic summit and hailed an airplane sales deal between Boeing and an Indonesian airline. Obama was in Bali, Indonesia, for the ASEAN meeting in a region that accounts for more than half of the world's GDP. He held bilateral talks with India, the Philippines and Malaysia beforehand. Obama helped announce a large plane order for U.S.-based Boeing to Lion Air. ""For the last several days, I've been talking about how we have to make sure that we've got a presence in this region, that it can result directly in jobs at home,"" Obama said in a statement. ""And what we see here -- a multibillion-dollar deal between Lion Air -- one of the fastest-growing airlines not just in the region, but in the world -- and Boeing is going to result in over 100,000 jobs back in the United States of America, over a long period of time."" He said more than 200 planes were in the order. ASEAN leaders, meanwhile, agreed that Myanmar can chair the regional bloc in 2014, amid some signs of reform. Some critics say it is still too early to award the high-profile role to Myanmar, where between 600 and 1,000 political prisoners are believed to remain behind bars. The Asian leg of Obama's trip follows two days spent in Australia, where he declared that the United States will increase its military presence and expand its role in shaping the Asia Pacific region. ""Our enduring interests in the region demand our enduring presence in this region,"" Obama told the Australian Parliament. ""The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay."" He announced an agreement with Australia on Wednesday that will expand military cooperation between the longtime allies and boost America's presence in the region. In a speech a day later, Obama made it clear that the military expansion is a top priority in the wake of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, even as the United States faces the need to reduce mounting federal deficits and debt. ""As we end today's wars, I have directed my national security team to make our presence and missions in the Asia Pacific a top priority,"" Obama said. ""As a result, reductions in U.S. defense spending will not -- I repeat, will not -- come at the expense of the Asia Pacific."" The speech on the second day of his two-day trip to Australia, Obama's first as president, signaled a policy objective to compete head-on with China for influence in the region while also providing security assurances for allies. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters that the policy comes in part from nations of the region seeking increased U.S. presence. ""The ability of the United States to help respond to contingencies is something that has been welcomed in recent years, whether, again, it was work that we're doing in the Philippines to counter violent extremism, work that we're doing to counter piracy in the region, the response to the tsunami in Indonesia,"" Rhodes said. ""So in other words, there's a demand signal from the nations of the region, and this is something that we're doing in concert with one of our closest allies. So we believe it's not just entirely appropriate, but an important step to dealing with the challenges of the future of the Asia Pacific region."" Under the military agreement announced Wednesday, up to 250 U.S. Marines will be sent to Darwin and the northern region of Australia for military exercises and training. Over the next several years their numbers are expected to climb to 2,500 -- a full Marine ground task force. Before departing Australia for Indonesia, the president, along with some U.S. Marines, visited a military base in Darwin. While speaking to the troops there, Obama thanked them for their service and praised the two nations' alliance, which is now 60 years old, and said he looks forward to a deepening of the alliance. Going forward, our purpose is the same as it was 60 years ago -- ""the preservation of peace and security. And in a larger sense, you're answering the question once posed by the great Banjo Paterson. Of Australia, he wrote, 'Hath she the strength for the burden laid upon her, hath she the power to protect and guard her own?'"" The president's Australian visit -- postponed twice in 2009 and 2010 due to the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and other domestic political considerations -- highlights a changing balance of power in the Pacific as China expands its military reach and the United States works to reduce its military footprint in Japan.

"(CNN) -- North Korea is ""skating very close to a dangerous line"" after weeks of saber-rattling, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned Wednesday as northeast Asia watched for an expected missile test. ""Their actions and their words have not helped defuse a combustible situation,"" Hagel told reporters at the Pentagon. He said the United States and its allies want to see North Korean rhetoric ""ratcheted down,"" but if that doesn't happen, ""our country is fully prepared to deal with any contingency."" ""We have every capacity to deal with any action North Korea will take to protect this country and the interests of this country and our allies,"" Hagel said. American radar and satellites are trained on the east coast of the Korean Peninsula, where the communist government of Kim Jong Un is believed to have prepared mobile ballistic missiles for launch at any time, U.S. and South Korean officials warned. Japan has deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo, some Chinese tour groups have canceled visits to North Korea and the top U.S. commander in the Pacific said Tuesday that he couldn't recall a time of greater tension in the region since the end of the Korean War in the 1950s. Cheney to GOP leaders: 'We're in deep doo-doo' on North Korea . Since December, North Korea has put a satellite in orbit atop a long-range rocket; conducted a nuclear bomb test, its third since 2006; and claimed to be prepared for pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the United States, though most analysts believe it does not yet have that capability. The north has given ample warning to the world before previous long-range rocket launches -- but it is keeping everyone guessing about what it might do this time around. Intelligence suggests that North Korea may be planning ""multiple missile launches"" in the coming days beyond two Musudan mobile missiles it has placed along its east coast, Pentagon officials told CNN. The officials did not have specifics on the numbers of other missiles and launchers. One official said the North Koreans are military ""masters of deception,"" and may have planned all along to focus the world's attention on the Musudans while they plan multiple launches of other missiles. That's a tactic they have used in the past, the official said. The United States is less troubled about the other missiles, a second Pentagon official told CNN. ""We've been seeing some launchers moving around. These are smaller and don't cause us as much concerns,"" that official said. ""We think these movements are within seasonal norms for their exercises."" But he didn't discount the possibility that they might launch some of those, as they often do. The Musudan is an untested weapon that South Korea says has a range as far as 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles). That would mean it could reach as far as Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases and where the United States recently said it was placing missile defense systems. After a launch, U.S. satellites and radars in the region would be able to calculate the trajectory of missiles within minutes and quickly conclude whether they are on a test path headed for open ocean or potentially headed for land areas such as Japan. The United States and Japan would then have to decide whether to try to shoot the missiles down, U.S. officials say. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday told CNN that despite being an ally of North Korea, it stands with the United States. ""On North Korea, we have no differences with the United States. One just shouldn't scare anyone with military maneuvers and there's a chance things might calm down,"" he said. U.S., North Korean officials met secretly in March . A launch without warning? South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said at a parliamentary hearing Wednesday that ""according to intelligence obtained by our side and the U.S., the possibility of a missile launch by North Korea is very high,"" the semiofficial South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. Yun said he was basing his assessment on South Korean and U.S. intelligence. On Tuesday, a U.S. official said that the American government believes a test launch could happen at any time and without North Korea issuing a standard notice to commercial aviation and maritime shipping that would warn planes and vessels to stay away from the missile's path. The official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information, cautioned that most of the information comes from satellite imagery, so it's impossible to reach a definitive conclusion because the United States cannot gather information on the ground. He said the launch could be ""imminent"" but also cautioned that the United States ""simply doesn't know."" Based on what the United States has seen, the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch. Speaking at a Senate Armed Services hearing Tuesday, Locklear said the U.S. military would not want to shoot down a North Korean missile whose trajectory would send it into the open sea. But he said if a missile's path appeared to threaten a U.S. ally, such as Japan, interceptor missiles could be used to try to bring it down. Japan poised to react 'calmly' Japan's deployment of missile defenses in Tokyo follows similar measures taken ahead of the North's rocket launches last year. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters Tuesday that his government would do ""calmly"" whatever needed to be done to protect its population. In a sign of the level of concern, however, the port city of Yokohama had to apologize for prematurely publishing a warning of a missile launch on the Twitter page of its emergency management agency. The tweet was up for about 20 minutes before being removed. The agency said that the misleading tweet was caused by human error and that it would work on changing its system to prevent the problem from happening again. Since the U.N. Security Council voted last month to impose new sanctions on Kim's regime over the latest North Korean nuclear test, Pyongyang has kept up a steady flow of words and acts that could give the impression of a nation heading inexorably toward conflict. On Tuesday, it advised foreigners in South Korea to secure shelter or evacuate the country in case of hostilities on the Korean Peninsula, the latest in a string of ominous warnings. It also kept more than 50,000 of its workers from an industrial complex jointly operated with South Korea, which had been a key symbol of cooperation between the two countries. North Korea's war of words escalates: A timeline of the crisis . 'Holiday atmosphere' inside North Korea . But on the same day, state media published articles that described festive events and international visits, suggesting a much less fraught situation inside North Korea. The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that various sporting events were happening or scheduled to take place to mark the 101st anniversary next week of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. ""The ongoing sports tournaments make the country seethe with holiday atmosphere,"" KCNA said. Kim Il Sung's birthday, known as the Day of the Sun, is a major public holiday in North Korea. The planned events include an international marathon Sunday in Pyongyang in which runners from North Korea and other countries will participate. KCNA also noted Tuesday the arrival by plane in North Korea of a delegation from the Japan-Korea Society for Scientific and Educational Interchange. Such visits sit strangely alongside the North's warning last week to foreign diplomats in Pyongyang that it wouldn't be able to guarantee their safety in the event of a conflict. Some North Korea watchers have observed that the regime's domestic propaganda has focused recently on efforts to promote economic development, while the bellicose threats appear targeted primarily at a foreign audience. North Korea's missile capabilities . Varying levels of concern . The angry rhetoric has also failed to alarm South Koreans, who have lived through decades of North Korean bombast. Residents of Seoul have continued to go unflappably about their daily business. ""South Korea has been living under such threats from the past, and we are always prepared for it,"" South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae told CNN on Wednesday. He called the current climate ""a very ordinary situation."" ""North Korea may launch missiles at any time, and our military is fully prepared for it,"" he said. But the North's fiery words appear to have had an effect on the American public, with 41% of those surveyed saying they see the reclusive nation as an immediate threat to the United States, according to a recent CNN/ORC International poll. That's up 13 percentage points in less than a month, CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wanted to get the attention of the American public, his strategy is starting to work,"" Holland said. Andrei Lankov, a professor of history at Kookmin University in Seoul, noted the varying levels of concern in an opinion article for The New York Times published Tuesday. ""The farther one is from the Korean Peninsula, the more one will find people worried about the recent developments here,"" he said. The tense situation does appear to have prompted some Chinese tour groups to call off upcoming trips to North Korea. Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said Wednesday that some agencies and tourists had canceled plans, but he said the Chinese-North Korean border continued to operate normally. Western tourism agencies that organize visits to North Korea haven't so far reported any changes to their activities. DMZ: Tensions high at knife-edge of Korean conflict . A troubled industrial zone . The most tangible signs of disruption are in the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the manufacturing zone on the North Korean side of the border where more than 120 South Korean companies operate. Last week, the North started blocking South Korean personnel from crossing the border back into the complex. And this week, it said it was pulling out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work inside the zone and temporarily suspending activities there. It had blocked the border crossing previously, in 2009, but pulling out the workers was a new step. As of Wednesday lunchtime, only a few hundred South Koreans remained inside the complex, according to South Korean authorities, down from more than 800 before the North started restricting entry. Also on Wednesday, South Korea accused the North of carrying out a wave of cyberattacks that paralyzed the networks of major South Korean banks and broadcasters last month. It is the first time that Seoul has formally pointed the finger at Pyongyang for the hacking, which affected more than 48,000 computers. CNN's Barbara Starr, Joe Sterling, Elise Labott, K.J. Kwon, Brian Walker, Tim Schwarz, Kyung Lah, Judy Kwon, David McKenzie, Tom Cohen and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","NEW: North Korea ""skating very close to a dangerous line,"" Pentagon chief says .

"(CNN) -- A human rights activist who was active in Bahrain's pro-democracy street protests appeared Sunday before a special military court showing signs of ill-treatment and perhaps torture, Human Rights Watch said Tuesday. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja was one of 14 defendants, most of them active with opposition political movements, who were charged with seeking to ""topple the regime forcibly in collaboration with a terrorist organization working for a foreign country,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement. The human rights group said al-Khawaja's wife and daughter spoke with him briefly after the court session, which was the first time they had been allowed to see him since April 9, when he was arrested and beaten. They said that they could see a number of injuries to his face, and that he told them he had suffered four fractures to his face, including one to his jaw that required four hours of surgery, the rights group said. ""It appears that Abdulhadi al-Khawaja's jailers tortured him during the month they held him in incommunicado detention,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Torture or ill-treatment is a serious crime, and Bahraini officials who did or authorized this treatment need to be held accountable,"" Stork said. Human Rights Watch said it has documented the routine use of torture by Bahraini security officials during similar interrogations in political and security-related cases. To give time for defendants to prepare their defenses or appoint their lawyers, Bahrain's National Safety Lower Court postponed the resumption of their trial until May 12, the rights group said. The military prosecutor brought the case against al-Khawaja, and the case is being overseen by a military judge. Bahrain's police and military have operated under a ""state of national safety"" since March 15. The defendants appeared before the special court with al-Khawaja; seven others are being tried in absentia, Human Rights Watch said. Before Sunday's court session, Bahrain's military public prosecutor, Col. Yusif Rashid Feleyfel, formed a committee composed of public prosecutors who questioned the 14 suspects, the state-run Bahrain News Agency (BNA) said. The agency said the defendants are accused of crimes that include ""organizing and managing a terrorist group for the overthrow and the change of the country's constitution and the royal rule,"" ""the seeking and correspondence with a terrorist organization abroad working for a foreign country to conduct heinous acts against the Kingdom of Bahrain,"" ""an attempt to overthrow and change the country's constitution and royal rule by force,"" funding a terrorist group, insulting the army, ""broadcasting false news and rumors"" that threatened public security, ""inciting the hatred of a certain sect of people,"" and organizing and participating in rallies without having obtained the proper permits. Two other detainees entered court with limps, the rights group said. ""Sources told Human Rights Watch that when the defendants asked to speak about the abuse they allegedly experienced in detention, security forces forcibly removed them from court,"" it added. Maryam al-Khawaja, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja's daughter, told Human Rights Watch on Monday that her mother, Khadija al-Mousawi, and sister, Zainab al-Khawaja, met with him for 10 minutes after the initial hearing. ""She said her father had gone on a hunger strike to protest his ill treatment and his lack of access to a lawyer,"" the statement said. ""She also said that he told his wife and daughter that he had been tortured, but could not describe details because the family meetings took place in the presence of security guards."" The rights group said it had previously received ""credible reports"" that al-Khawaja had been admitted to Bahrain Defense Force Hospital for treatment of injuries for six days. ""One person who claimed to have seen him said he was at that point unrecognizable as a result of apparent beatings in detention,"" it said. But authorities denied on Sunday that he had been hospitalized or that any of the detainees had been tortured, Human Rights Watch said. And BNA called the reports ""fabricated, politically-motivated news."" Human Rights Watch noted that Bahrain is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which prohibits torture, and that Bahrain has ratified the Convention Against Torture. The rights group called on Bahrain to suspend prosecution of civilians in special military courts, to grant them access to lawyers, relatives, and medical care, and to set up an impartial commission to look into allegations of torture. The country is ruled by the Al-Khalifa family, which has been in power since the 18th century. Many protesters are calling for the removal of the royal family, whom they blame for the country's high unemployment and for running a corrupt government that relies on torture and other harsh measures to clamp down on dissent. Bahrain is an American ally and home to the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. The Al-Khalifa royal family is Sunni Muslim, but two-thirds of the population are Shiites. In recent years, younger Shiites have staged violent protests to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, and many Shiites say the country's constitution has done little to improve their condition.","Abulhadi al-Khawaja shows possible signs of torture, Human Rights Watch says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hundreds of dock workers demanding better pay and working conditions entered a seventh day of strikes in Hong Kong Wednesday, crippling the world's third busiest container port and causing widespread shipping delays. About 500 workers and their supporters gathered outside Hong Kong's Kwai Tsing Container Terminal, where workers demanded a 15% pay increase and a collective bargaining relationship with the container terminal operator, Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT), according to the strike organizer, Chan Chiu-wai of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions. HIT employs the workers through a number of contractors. Company officials said that the port was losing about $640,000 a day and the strike is causing berthing delays of up to 60 hours, according to the South China Morning Post. HIT is a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which is owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. HIT did not respond to CNN's questions Wednesday. Chan said that dock workers were presently paid $167 per day for 24 consecutive hours of work, less that than they received in 1997. ""We have been asking to talk with them for a very long time but both the terminal and the contractors have refused to talk to us,"" said Chan. ""This is an indefinite strike, we have no time limit and we will strike until our demands are fulfilled."" Chan said staff often work shifts of up to 72 consecutive hours during high-season. ""For this work, the salary is very low, the working conditions are very poor and the hours are very long, so we are often in the position of being understaffed and the workers have to work many hours overtime,"" Chan added. HIT dismissed claims that workers were being paid less now than they were in 1997. ""It's also wrong that their pay is now lower than in 1997 or during SARS,"" HIT general manager Gerry Yim Lui-fai told the South China Morning Post. The workers have attracted many supporters among student unions and pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Federation of Students have organized donation and supply collection points outside major train stations. Hong Kong's pro-democracy Labour Party is also supporting the strike. ""We have raised HK$1.2 million ($154,000) so far to support the workers and we are paying them (HK)$1,000 a day during the strike,"" said Lee Cheuk-yan, Labour Party chairman. ""We have also just gained the support of the International Trade Union Confederation and it's a very encouraging development. We are confident the strike will not be easily displaced."" More than 100 dock workers, including crane operators and stevedores, went on strike inside the Kwai Tsing Container terminal on March 28, demanding a $1.60 per hour raise. More workers have since joined the action, but they were forced to set up camp outside the port after a Hong Kong court granted HIT a temporary court injunction on April 1 banning unionists and their supporters from entering any of the four Kwai Tsing container terminals.","Dock workers in Hong Kong are striking for the seventh day, crippling port operations .

"(CNN) -- World leaders are moving carefully and anxiously, trying to prevent a disaster in the Korean Peninsula. This increasingly unpredictable round of saber-rattling is far from over, but so far the winner is the North Korean regime and the losers are the brutally oppressed North Korean people, joined by much of the rest of the world. While we watch the drama from far away, it's worth noting just how far North Korean weapons programs -- not just the weapons themselves -- can reach. U.S. intelligence officials differ on their estimates of the range and accuracy of North Korean missiles, nuclear-tipped or not. But the country's nuclear and missile technology has already found its way to the Middle East. North Korea helped Syria develop a nuclear reactor. It has sold missile technology and weapons to anyone willing to pay, and it has developed close cooperation with Iran. If the crisis ended right now -- with every piece of military hardware back to where it stood a few months ago and everyone taking a vow of silence on the matter so that we get no more threats and no more demands -- the confrontation would have already sent clear and damaging messages across the globe, encouraging tyrants and regimes seeking or considering the idea of developing nuclear weapons. Opinion: North Korea endgame - 3 scenarios . North Korea's message seems to be: If you have nuclear capabilities, it doesn't matter how outrageously you behave; it doesn't matter how horribly you mistreat your people; it doesn't matter how flimsy your economy is. When you have a nuclear arsenal, countries that could topple your regime with a tiny fraction of their power suddenly become afraid of making you angry. This is a pernicious reality with tragic and hazardous consequences. Nuclear development makes it easier for the totalitarian regime to condemn the North Korean people to grinding poverty and imprisonment in nightmarish gulags. Several generations of the same family can live and die in captivity. While the North Korean people go hungry, the regime diverts scarce resources to its nuclear and missile programs while its top leader, the youthful Kim Jong Un, adds insult to injury with his visibly expanding girth. As the latest crisis unfolded and as North Korea threatened a ""preemptive nuclear attack"" on the United States, a ""final destruction"" of South Korea, and a ""nuclear attack"" on Tokyo, world powers held a new round of talks with the Iranian regime over its nuclear program. Coincidence or not, the talks with Iran produced nothing, not even the customary agreement to hold more talks. Iran, one can only imagine, must be paying close attention to the dance macabre between Pyongyang and the rest of the world. North Korea, whose entire economy is worth about $40 billion -- less than a small-sized American city and a tiny fraction of prosperous South Korea and its trillion-dollar economy -- has ordered the whole world to attention. Experts are scratching their heads, trying to figure out what exactly Kim Jong Un wants and how far he will go. There's general consensus that he wants, like all dictators, to strengthen his hold on power and to secure the support of the military. But he is accomplishing more than that. North Korea is giving its crucial weapons industry a huge boost of publicity. Every headline is a Super Bowl-size ad for the country's destructive wares. Opinion: Why I fled North Korea . Current and future clients may have noticed that its arsenal has allowed North Korea to get away with creating these crises, which fortify the regime and sometimes even bring generous international aid. Without its dangerous arsenal, it's unlikely Pyongyang would have gotten away with the 2010 shelling of Yeonpyeong island, when it killed two South Korean marines and three civilians, sent the population fleeing in panic and set homes and forests on fire. Despite South Korea's vow of ""enormous retaliation,"" the regime is still in place. Not only is it still standing, it is spreading its deadly know-how. North Korea has long been one of the world's top proliferators of missiles and other weapons systems. U.S. officials say Iran recently received North Korean missiles capable of reaching Western European capitals. Last September, Tehran and Pyongyang signed a scientific cooperation agreement, which experts say is almost identical to the one North Korea signed with Syria a decade ago. That agreement with Damascus brought North Korean technicians to help the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad build a nuclear reactor that Israeli warplanes destroyed in 2007. And the North, incidentally, is still sending weapons to Damascus. Back home, when North Korea carried out its third nuclear test earlier this year, news reports in the region said Iranian scientists were there to observe. This standoff is not over, but Pyongyang has already won. From the moment the North obtained nuclear weapons, however rudimentary, the game changed. From that moment, the chances that the North Korean people will rejoin the world and have a chance at a better life diminished greatly. From that moment, the South and the West's room to maneuver became much more limited. The challenge now is to prevent a greater disaster, while keeping the regime from scoring an even greater victory, as it has in the past, by walking away from this confrontation with new rewards. Beyond that, the world must seek a creative way to help free the North Korean people, while bearing in mind the disastrous consequences of allowing dangerous regimes to obtain nuclear weapons. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: North Korean weapons programs have spread to the Middle East .

"(CNN) -- A former ""top cop,"" who had the honor of sitting next to first lady Michelle Obama during a televised presidential speech four years ago, is facing rape allegations. Richard DeCoatsworth left a party with two women on Thursday, according to authorities. The women called authorities and said once they arrived at a second, undisclosed location, the retired officer pulled a gun on them, the Philadelphia Police Department said in a statement. He allegedly forced them ""to engage in the use of narcotics and to engage in sexual acts,"" the statement said. He was charged with rape on Saturday. DeCoatsworth became a hero in 2007, after an assailant shot him in the face with a shotgun, according to a White House statement preceding President Barack Obama's 2009 speech to Congress. Then a rookie on the Philadelphia police force, DeCoatsworth had followed a group of men in a car, whose activities he found suspicious. They parked and three men got out of the vehicle. As he followed them on foot, a fourth man emerged from the car and fired a blast from a shotgun at DeCoatsworth's face. He briefly lost his eyesight. ""But when his vision returned, he was still standing. Bleeding from the face, DeCoatsworth chased the perpetrator on foot for nearly two blocks. The officer returned fire and put out flash information on the subject during the pursuit, before he finally collapsed,"" the White House statement said. More officers arrived, and the assailant was captured. The Philadelphia Police Department rewarded DeCoatsworth for his valor, promoting him to an elite highway patrol unit. He received the ""Top Cops"" award in 2008 from the National Association of Police Organizations. In February 2009, dressed in a ceremonial uniform, he took a seat of honor next to Michelle Obama for the president's address before a Joint Session of Congress. But two years later, the officer's meteoric career took a dive, when he was accused of using excessive force, shooting a motorcyclist in the leg, CNN affiliate KYW reported. He retired in 2011. Last year, the City of Philadelphia granted him a disability pension, according to a city government protocol. But a neighbor also took him to court, claiming DeCoatsworth had threatened him. Along with rape, the former hero faces accusations of ""sex assault, terrorist threats and other related charges,"" according to police. KYW reported his bail at $60 million. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report .","Richard DeCoatsworth took a shotgun blast to the face in the line of duty in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Formula One teams are planning an innovative joint launch ahead of the 2010 season. In a further effort to cut costs, the move will see all 13 teams on show in a special event in Valencia at the end of January. In the past, teams have either held their own special launches at their factories, or revealed their cars at one of the pre-season tests. Mercedes-Benz GP chief executive Nick Fry outlined the initiative at the Motor Sport Business Forum in Monaco. ""I don't want to go into too much detail about what the plans actually are, but we have agreed between all the teams to do a joint launch and we do wish to turn it into a proper event,"" Fry told reporters. ""We are getting a lot of help from the venue and investment in communication and marketing to do that. I wouldn't wish to spill the beans on what we are going to do, but it is going to be hugely new and innovative. ""It is going to be a clear demonstration of how we are going to be working together. We are not all going off and doing our own individual launches, so we can do something that is a lot more customer friendly."" It is understood the new teams -- Virgin Racing, US F1, Lotus and Campos -- may struggle to have their cars ready by then, but they would certainly be present at the event.","Formula One teams are planning an innovative joint launch ahead of the 2010 season.

"(CNN) -- So we're at a point in the campaign where health care reform is about to go on trial at the Supreme Court, unemployment remains high and gas prices are skyrocketing. As for the GOP presidential wannabes, they're arguing over, um, an Etch A Sketch metaphor bungled by a Mitt Romney staffer. (""You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again,"" Romney senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom told CNN this week.) Sure, the metaphor has a perfection all its own, given Romney's penchant for redrawing policy lines. It's just low-hanging fruit, hard to pass up. But the picture of two ""serious"" presidential candidates wandering the trail with an old-school toy as a prop can lead to only one conclusion: This is getting silly. The intellectual arguments have been made. The differences have been debated. And the voters are speaking. Sure, they're conflicted: hard-line conservatives and evangelicals will never love Romney. But Romney has what appears to be an insurmountable delegate lead. He will not sprint across the finish line, to be sure. He will crawl across it. But he will get there nonetheless. If this were another time, the establishment power brokers would step in with a vision. They would take the candidates aside, give them the big-picture analysis from 30,000 feet and say: ""Unite for the sake of the party."" Then they would take to the airwaves and offer their full-throated endorsements, turning their attention to seeking the defeat of President Obama. Â . Not happening. Consider this: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush endorses Romney, but there's no rally, huge photo op or choreographed endorsement tour. One prominent tea party group says, well, I suppose we can live with Romney if that's what we have to do. And tea party favorite Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, stops short of endorsing Romney but grudgingly allows that ""I think we all need to look at this presidential primary and encourage the candidates to do a little self-reflection here -- what's good for our country."" The moves toward Romney have all of the enthusiasm and passion of an arranged marriage. So what can be done? Answer: Not much. The next moves are up to the candidates. First of all, the old-time power brokers don't have much to offer anymore. The political power within the GOP has moved away from any organized structure toward two force fields: the populist guy in the street and the rich guys who can write multimillion-dollar checks. The super PACÂ sugar daddies -- simply by virtue of their money -- are the reason the campaigns continue. What's the incentive for Newt Gingrich to get out as long as Sheldon Adelson, from his perch in Vegas, is willing to keep paying for his political ads? The same goes for Foster Friess, Santorum's man, who gets to dabble in politics from his mountain views in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I bet these fellows haven't had this much fun in years. Meantime, the newly populist GOP grass roots won't be told what to do anyway. Party organizations can't deliver them anymore, and Romney isn't exactly the guy they were wishing for when the tea party came on the scene in 2010. The establishment is in disrepute as far as they're concerned; those are the people who bungled the economy. ""People feel they can make this decision on their own,"" Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole, who hasn't yet endorsed, tells me. ""There's just a lot less party loyalty. ... We are in a period where people are searching."" At some point, though, the search has to end. The money men could get tired of writing checks for fewer and fewer delegates. The math may become overpowering. At some point, the voters will get restless. Yet the final decisions will have to come from the men running. Granted, Gingrich and Santorum don't like Romney much -- and the longer they run against him, the less they like him. And often with good reason. But here's the final consideration: ""You don't want the blame for losing,"" Cole says. ""It's one thing to fight the good fight. ... But look at Romney in 2008. He knew when to get out."" Yes he did. Romney knew how to end it the right way in 2008. After Super Tuesday, he saw the handwriting on the wall and embraced John McCain. And there's a lesson in that: Parties reward the winners, sure. But voters like good losers, too. Knowing how to lose is the hardest part of running. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Borger: GOP candidates are wandering campaign trail with Etch A Sketch toys .

"(CNN) -- Formula One team Hispania Racing (HRT) have called up reserve driver Christian Klien for Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix after regular first choice Sakon Yamamoto withdrew through illness. Yamamoto is suffering from food poisoning and will hope to recover in time for his home grand prix in Suzuka, Japan on October 10. For Austria's Klien, it will be his first Formula One race since driving for Red Bull Racing during the 2006 season. HRT team principle Colin Kolles confirmed the change via Formula One's official website: ""It looks as if Sakon Yamamoto has food poisoning, and he doesn't feel well. ""Because of this, Christian Klien will be driving the car this Friday (in practice) and the rest of the Singapore Grand Prix."" The 27-year-old Klien first made his breakthrough in Formula One with Jaguar in 2004, before spending two years with Red Bull. Since then he has been a test driver for both Honda and BMW Sauber before making the switch to HRT. Meanwhile, former Renault boss Flavio Briatore believes seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher has made a mistake by returning to Formula One. Briatore, who worked with Schumacher in his days at the Benetton Formula one team, said the legendary German will have realized that, at the age of 41, he cannot compete with the younger drivers. Speaking to the official Formula One website, the Italian said: ""I think when he signed the contract he honestly believed that it was the right decision. ""The same way I think that he already knew that it was a mistake at the first serious test. Then he awoke to the fact of how alarmingly fast these youngsters are today. ""At 41, you simply cannot keep up with (Mercedes GP teammate, Nico) Rosberg and all the other guys."" The 60-year-old has also ruled out an imminent return to Formula One after he was forced to leave the sport following his role in race fixing at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. ""I want to have fun with what I'm doing -- that is my motivation and not the need for a job. At the moment I wouldn't have fun in Formula One,"" he said. ""At the moment I am happy with what I am doing -- being a dad, husband, and taking care of my investments.""","HRT have withdrawn Sakon Yamamoto from the Singapore Grand Prix through illness .

"(CNN) -- Over Valentine's Day weekend in 2003, a group of Italian thieves broke into a massive vault in the heart of Antwerp, Belgium's diamond district and got away with an estimated $500 million worth of precious stones and diamonds. While the rest of the city was busy celebrating romance and love, these tenacious men peeled open safe deposit box after safe deposit box, leaving excess treasure on the ground like it was garbage. When the security guard came to unlock the vault door on Monday morning, he found it already opened and the vault floor littered with millions of dollars worth of diamonds, gold, semiprecious gems and other items the thieves left behind. Everyone was stunned. Despite the heavy security, the unimaginable happened. Drag queens, fake beards, chocolates: Notable diamond heists . Ten years later, it happened again. On Monday night, a well-organized group of armed men dressed like police officers swarmed a passenger plane in Brussels, Belgium, and made off with about $50 million worth of diamonds. It just shows -- you can never let down your guard when it comes to diamonds. The problem with safeguarding diamonds is that they are so incredibly valuable and easy to resell that thieves will always be trying to get their hands on them. It is important for those tasked with securing such high value items to never grow complacent. The more valuable a target, the more likely that there will be those out there biding their time and learning the mechanics of the security measures in order to break them. Once a heist occurs, it is nearly impossible to trace back the stolen diamonds. Just as banks have problems with robbers desiring their cash, those in the diamond trade have to constantly prepare for the possibility that one day, after years and years of nothing happening, they will be under attack. In the 2003 heist, the vault was thought to be impregnable in part because of the surrounding high security of the Antwerp diamond district. But the clever thieves bypassed the security by entering through the rear of the building that held the vault via a garage door that opened outside the secure portion of the district. After that, they had to beat a combination lock, key lock, heat detector, motion detector, light detector and more. Monday's heist involved a transfer of diamonds from the Antwerp diamond district to the Brussels airport. I've seen these diamond runs before. A Brinks armored truck arrives in nearby Antwerp, passes through the extensive security surrounding the diamond district and picks up cash and diamonds. Then it takes the valued goods to the Brussels airport to be flown to diamond centers around the world. Key elements of the security in these runs include the armored truck, which would be difficult, although not impossible to neutralize. The runs are also accompanied by police officers equipped with submachine guns and body armor. Antwerp's diamond district, much like Brussels' airport, has hundreds of closed circuit cameras, armed guards and barriers against unauthorized vehicles as part of its security measures. The thieves must have watched and noticed that as impressive as this security looks, there were holes. Or perhaps they had an inside source that alerted them to a vulnerability. Once the trucks arrived at the airport with their police escort, they would make their delivery and then leave. So for a very small window of time, only unarmed cargo workers would guard the jewels. Those transporting diamonds assumed that the security at a major international airport would be enough to protect their goods. Now they know they can't assume anything. The thieves just needed to get around all the normal airport security that prevented them from walking into the airport and getting to the plane through the front door. There were holes in the airport's security wide enough to drive a truck through, and that's literally what happened. The thieves cut some fences, drove onto the tarmac, grabbed the diamonds and got out fast. In the age of terrorism, it is shocking that armed men were able to make it onto a tarmac right beside an airplane filled with passengers. The thieves took advantage of this assumption by everyone involved that an airport tarmac is a safe place. The people transporting the diamonds should have made sure they were secure until the moment the plane lifted off the ground and maybe even have someone on board to protect them in flight. Instead, the armed police who brought the diamonds to the airport were gone by the time the robbers drove up to the plane. Anytime that you are protecting something of enormous value, you need to stay aware that there are smart, talented people who will spend the time needed to carefully dissect the security and exploit any weakness in it. Those protecting diamonds need to be running scenarios where they imagine ways to negate or bypass their own security. Perhaps outside experts -- or teams -- could be used, one side trying to achieve a criminal objective, while the other thinks of ways of beefing up security to prevent them. Ten years after the world-record-setting diamond heist in Antwerp, this week's diamond robbery is a sharp reminder that sophisticated criminal outfits are still out there and that even the most impressive security system could have unnoticed holes. As long as we value diamonds, there will be those who apply their intelligence and creativity to stealing them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott Andrew Selby.","On Tuesday, armed men pulled a heist and made off with about $50 million worth of diamonds .

"(CNN) -- Prediction: 2013 will be a year of serious global crisis. That crisis is predictable, and in fact has already begun. It will inescapably confront the next president of the United States. Yet this emerging crisis got not a mention at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. We'll see if the Democrats do better. The crisis originates in this summer's extreme weather. Almost 80% of the continental United States experienced drought conditions. Russia and Australia experienced drought as well. The drought has ruined key crops. The corn harvest is expected to drop to the lowest level since 1995. In just July, prices for corn and wheat jumped about 25% each, prices for soybeans about 17%. These higher grain prices will flow through to higher food prices. For consumers in developed countries, higher food prices are a burden -- but in almost all cases, a manageable burden. Americans spend only about 10% of their after-tax incomes on food of all kinds, including restaurant meals and prepackaged foods. Surveys for Gallup find that the typical American family is spending one-third less on food today, adjusting for inflation, than in 1969. But step outside the developed world, and the price of food suddenly becomes the single most important fact of human economic life. In poor countries, people typically spend half their incomes on food -- and by ""food,"" they mean first and foremost bread. When grain prices spiked in 2007-2008, bread riots shook 30 countries across the developing world, from Haiti to Bangladesh, according to the Financial Times.Â A drought in Russia in 2010 forced suspension of Russian grain exports that year and set in motion the so-called Arab spring. Since the days of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian government has provided subsidized bread to the population. A disk of round flat bread costs about a penny. In the later 2000s, however, the Mubarak government found it could not keep pace with surging grain costs. As Egypt's population doubled from 20 million in 1950 to 40 million in 1980 and now more than 80 million, Egypt has gained first place as the world's largest wheat importer. The price rises of 2007-2010 exceeded the Mubarak government's resources. Cheap bread vanished from the stores. Discontent gathered. In the August 18 issue of the British magazine The Spectator, John R. Bradley, an Arabic-speaking journalist long resident in Egypt, described what happened next: . Â ""The conversations of tiny groups of Cairo's English-speaking elites, and their Western drinking companions, were a world apart from talk among the Egyptian masses. ... The main hope of those who poured into Tahrir Square was shared by the revolutionaries in Tunisia: that sudden and radical change would miraculously mean affordable food."" And if food prices surge again? China is especially vulnerable to food cost inflation. In just one month, July 2011, the cost of living jumped 6.5%. Inflation happily subsided over the course of 2012. Springtime hopes for a bumper U.S. grain crop in 2012 enabled the Chinese central bank to ease credit in the earlier part of the summer. Now the Chinese authorities will face some tough choices over what to do next. The Arab Spring of 2011 is sometimes compared to the revolutions of 1848. That's apter than people realize: the ""hungry '40s"" were years of bad harvests across Europe. Hungry people are angry people, and angry people bring governments down. Will 2013 bring us social turmoil in Brazil, strikes in China or revolution in Pakistan? The answer can probably be read in the price indexes of the commodities exchanges -- and it is anything but reassuring.Â . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: The drought in the U.S., Russia and Australia is driving up food prices .

"(CNN) -- A Pakistani political party official has publicly named two U.S. CIA officials in connection with a police murder investigation into a drone strike. Police had already initiated an investigation against unnamed persons after a recent drone strike that killed five. In a televised news conference Wednesday, Shireen Mazari, information secretary for the Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said she filed an addendum to the police complaint, singling out two U.S. officials. She gave the names of U.S. CIA Director John Brennan and a person identified as the CIA's Station Chief based in Pakistan. U.S. officials did not confirm to CNN the accuracy of her claims. ""I can't speak to the alleged operational issues, but more broadly I note we have a strong ongoing dialogue with Pakistan regarding all aspects of our bilateral relationship and shared interests,"" a U.S. Embassy official in Pakistan told CNN. If in fact Mazari outed the identity of a high-ranking CIA agent, it could have repercussions. In 2010, the CIA recalled its top spy in Pakistan after he was identified in a lawsuit filed by a man whose son and brother were killed by a drone strike. The PTI is led by cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, a staunch opponent of drone strikes. His party is demanding that the national government block the ground supply lines to Afghanistan unless the United States ends the strikes, which have focused on Pakistan's loosely governed tribal areas where many militants are based. Report: U.S., Pakistan had secret agreement on dozens of drone strikes . The drone strike that Mazari linked the CIA officials to happened in northwest Pakistan. The suspected U.S. drone strike killed six people in Hangu district, targeting a seminary belonging to the Afghan Haqqani Network. It was said to be one of the first U.S. drone strikes outside of Pakistan's tribal districts. Police initially said that all the victims of the drone strike were Afghans, but there have been conflicting reports, and on Tuesday Mazari also said some victims were Pakistani. The Pakistani police initiated an investigation for murder and waging war on Pakistan. Mazari called for the high-ranking CIA official in Pakistan to be put on a list to prevent him from leaving the country. The country's interior ministry said that as of Wednesday, it had not received such instructions. CNN has reached out to the CIA for comment on the developments.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Royal Mail, Britain's postal service, has unveiled a range of stamps commemorating some of Britain's most notable Formula 1 drivers, ranging from Stirling Moss in the 1950s to Nigel Mansell in the 1980s. Jackie Stewart is Britain's most successful Formula 1 driver, having won world championships in 1969, 1971 and 1973 . The six stamps, in varying denominations, depict Moss in his 1957 Vanwall, Graham Hill in his 1962 BRM, Jim Clark in his 1963 Lotus, Jackie Stewart in his 1973 Tyrell, James Hunt in his 1976 McLaren and Nigel Mansell in his 1986 Williams. The stamps were timed to capitalize on Lewis Hamilton's home grand prix at Silverstone, such is the fervor for the young BF driver in Britain. But industrial action -- a dispute about modernization plans and pay -- throughout the Royal Mail group has overshadowed their release. As a matter of protocol no British stamp can depict the face a living person other than the monarch, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, which explains why the cars are pictured from above, revealing only the tops of the drivers' helmets. Royal Mail has celebrated Formula 1 before -- in 2004 it released a set of ""smilers"" stamps interspersed with non-postal stamps depicting the Jordan Formula 1 team -- but it is the first time it has created a set of postage stamps with a Formula 1 theme. The stamps have caused some controversy as they celebrate one driver -- Stirling Moss -- who never won a world championship, while omitting Mike Hawthorn, the first British driver to win the title, and Damon Hill, the last British driver to win the title. However British dependency, Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands between Britain and France, has redressed the balance by releasing its own set of Formula 1 postage stamps. The eight stamps -- released to coincide with the centenary of the Brooklands motor racing track, home to the very first British Grand Prix -- depict all the drivers to have won world championships: Mike Hawthorn (1958), Graham Hill (1962, 1968), Jim Clark (1963, 1965), Jackie Stewart (1969, 1971, 1973), James Hunt (1976), Nigel Mansell (1992) and Damon Hill (1996). Britain is not the only country to have celebrated its Formula 1 heritage in postage stamp form. In 1999 Monaco produced a stamp to commemorate 70 years of the Monte Carlo Grand Prix, picturing a single-seat Bugatti racer and Michael Schumacher in a 1998 Ferrari F300. Even countries without an obvious Formula 1 heritage have celebrated the sport and the Ferrari team in particular. San Marino, which has been home to many Formula 1 grands prix has produced Ferrari F1-themed stamps but so too have Bosnia Herzegovina, Somalia, Jamaica, Chad, Malagasy, Benin, Antigua & Barbuda, Grenada, Carriacou & Petite Martinique and Kazakhstan.

"(CNN) -- Russia's finance minister has played down the impact of a dialing-back of the U.S. Federal Reserve's stimulus program, saying the country will weather it better than other developing economies. Anton Siluanov, speaking to CNN at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, said Russia's lack of speculative capital flows would protect it from a slump. ""Russia, as opposed to other developing countries, will be less impacted by that occurrence,"" he said. READ MORE: Ignore the Fed . His comments come after a massive global sell-off triggered by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's suggestions that the Fed could begin to scale back the program later this year and end it completely in 2014. Stock markets around the world sank, including by nearly 4% in Russia. The country's economy is already under pressure from investment outflows, lower commodity prices and a sinking ruble. It is one of the weaker BRIC nations, with growth tagged at just 2.4% for 2013, according to the International Monetary Fund, and its currency is at an 11-month low. READ MORE: World's new powers don't need the West . However, Siluanov said he ""always remained an optimist"" and believed Russia could face any economic headwinds from the Fed's expected move. As for other markets, those ""waves of outflows"" will die out and in three months would be ""nothing significant,"" he said.

However, Siluanov told CNN said the investment was not purely designed for growth. Sochi, the cost of which is reportedly $50 billion and rising, was ""never meant to be a purely economic growth stimulating initiative,"" he said. ""It was always an infrastructure project."" According to Siluanov, ""it is designed to improve life in the region,"" and ""make it more popular and attractive for our citizens.""

"(CNN) -- Marussia will head into the 2012 Formula One season with an untried car after the team's new MR01 failed a crucial crash test. New regulations introduced by motorsport's governing body, the FIA, require each car to pass 18 observed crash tests before it can be driven in preseason testing. The Russian-owned team -- formerly known as Virgin -- has now withdrawn from the last official test event in Barcelona this week to focus on passing the final requirement ahead of the season-opening race in Australia on March 18. ""We are disappointed to confirm that the planned first test of the 2012 race car has been delayed as a consequence of not passing the final FIA crash test,"" the Britain-based team said in a statement on Tuesday.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate on Thursday passed a giant defense bill that includes a new policy for detaining and trying suspected al Qaeda terrorists -- a policy that attracted controversy during the debate and may draw a presidential veto. The defense authorization bill passed by a vote of 93-7. In keeping with budget cuts across the government, the $662 billion bill shrinks Pentagon spending by $43 billion from last year. It includes funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and sets policies for the various weapons systems and personnel programs at the Defense Department. Senate debate on the detainee matter was at times volatile and emotional. After years of struggling with issues of who should investigate, detain and try suspected terrorists -- civilian authorities and courts or the military and its tribunal system -- Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and ranking Republican John McCain of Arizona reached a long-sought compromise to codify the process. However, critics complained the deal was weighted toward the military because it required any suspected al Qaeda terrorists, even those captured inside the U.S., to be held potentially indefinitely by the military. That concerned the White House and many lawmakers who think the responsibility belongs, in part, to law enforcement agencies and the federal courts and warned that Americans could possibly be detained indefinitely by the military. Levin and McCain denied their bill would allow for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens. ""This country is special because we have certain values, and due process of law is one of those values,"" Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, argued on the Senate floor. ""I object to holding American citizens without trial. I do not believe that makes us more safe."" ""You have people on the left who hate saying 'the war on terror,'"" responded Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. ""They would never ever use the military and always insist the law enforcement be used because they don't buy into the idea that we're at war. They want to criminalize the war."" Senators ultimately reached an agreement to amend the bill to make clear it's not the bill's intent to allow for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens and others legally residing in the country. ""It would provide the assurance that we are not adversely affecting the rights of American citizens in this language,"" Levin said while expressing support for the compromise. ""It supports present law,"" Feinstein added. Senators from both parties also challenged the Obama administration's policies toward Iran, unanimously approving an amendment insisting on tough new sanctions against Iran's Central Bank and entities that do business with it. Senators want to punish Iran over its pursuit of a nuclear weapons programs and the recent storming of the British Embassy in Tehran. The administration complained the Senate amendment would make it difficult for the White House to manage a delicate foreign policy matter. Also Thursday, the Senate approved on a voice vote a Democratic amendment requiring President Barack Obama to develop a plan to expedite the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, which is scheduled to be completed in 2014. While it's not clear the amendment will force any actual acceleration of the withdrawal, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said the Senate vote was a ""message"" to the president that U.S. troops have successfully performed their mission of stamping out al Qaeda and the 9-11 terrorists and ""it's time to bring our men and women home."" The measure still needs to go to conference for reconciliation with the House version of the bill.","Defense authorization bill passes Senate in 93-7 vote .

"(CNN) -- Members of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's M23 rebel movement said Wednesday they would withdraw from the captured city of Goma in line with a demand by regional leaders and the African Union. The M23 forces will pull back to a position about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Goma, officers and soldiers from the group told CNN. They will also leave a 100-strong contingent at the city's airport, as foreseen under a plan drawn up by African leaders who convened in neighboring Uganda over the weekend, the M23 officers and soldiers said. The rebels will keep their administration in Goma, they added. Goma is a key city in the eastern part of the country that rebels seized last week after days of fighting with government forces. It remained calm Wednesday morning as people sought to go about their normal business. On Wednesday evening, M23 rebels were seen packing their equipment to possibly move out of Goma, but the group continued to give mixed signals about whether they would go. The M23 helped orchestrate a rally of mostly young men to show who supported the group. Several hundred protesters carried placards calling for President Joseph Kabila to stand down and saying ""yes to the revolution."" Some complained about tribal discrimination. Humanitarian groups have warned of an impending crisis in the area. More than 140,000 people have been displaced by the latest violence, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.N. refugee agency, on top of those already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region. Read more: Why the world is ignoring Congo war . African leaders who convened in Uganda over the weekend demanded that the M23 group withdraw from Goma as a condition of initiating negotiations. The Great Lakes region leaders called on the rebels to ""stop all war activities"" and ""stop talk of overthrowing an elected government."" It also called on the Congolese government to listen to the rebels' grievances and to seek to resolve them. The U.N. Security Council added its own demands Wednesday, condemning any outside forces supporting M23 and not impeding the flow of weapons in the area. The Security Council also extended the arms embargo and other sanctions imposed against armed rebel groups in the Congo, while expressing its intention to consider additional targeted sanctions against the leadership of the M23. The sanctions, which were imposed in 2003 as the civil war in Congo ended, will be extended until February 1, 2014. The Council also asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to renew the mandate of the group of experts monitoring these measures until February 1, 2014. The group was named for a peace deal reached on March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. Its demands include the release of political prisoners, the investigation of alleged targeted killings in the country, the dismissal of the national election commission and the examination of the results of last year's election. Read more: Why eastern DRC is 'rape capital of the world' Over the weekend, the Great Lakes region leaders hatched a plan that calls for an integrated force being deployed for an initial period of three months at Goma airport. It would include a 100-strong neutral force, which would be in command, 100 troops from the Congolese army and 100 members of the M23. The Congolese army should be back on the streets of Goma on Thursday, according to the proposal. CNN iReport: Women and children flee DRC . M23 political leader Jean-Marie Runiga, who earlier said that the rebels would hold their ground until negotiations started with the Congolese government and their conditions were met, appeared to soften his stance Wednesday. He said withdrawal was possible out of respect for the calls from regional leaders. Runiga said that the rebels wanted to sit down and discuss the March 23 agreement with civil society, the government and a broad spectrum of the Congolese people to come up with lasting solutions on good governance, democracy, the economy and security. Runiga said the M23 would maintain a humanitarian corridor, and he called on people to respect the role of MONUSCO, the U.N. peacekeeping force in the region mandated to protect civilians. MONUSCO forces took a back seat as army forces battled the rebels for control of the city last week. Read more: Election could be a test of DRC's democracy . Col. Olivier Hamuli, a Congolese army spokesman, said the armed forces were awaiting guidance from the government and would abide by a cease-fire until they were told to do otherwise. The United Nations has called on the rebels to lay down their arms and withdraw immediately from Goma. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday that aid groups had been able to resume deliveries to sites around Goma over the weekend, after fighting caused days of disruption. The U.N. refugee agency said it was trying to reach 110,000 people with supplies of food, soap and water containers. Many of those who have fled to refugee camps around Goma are in urgent need of shelter and clean water, the UNHCR said. ""Sanitary conditions remain a major challenge due to the lack of toilets and water supply points,"" it said. Cases of vomiting, diarrhea and respiratory infections have already been recorded, it said, with the last due to people having to sleep outside without shelter from the rain. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has seen far more than its share of violence over the decades. Civil wars -- most recently in the 1990s through 2003 -- have left millions dead across the country and displaced entire generations.

"(CNN) -- A third Oklahoma teen is now facing a felony murder charge months after the shooting death of a college baseball player from Australia. Prosecutors have dropped a youth offender charge against Michael Jones, 17, and are charging him as an adult with felony first-degree murder, Melody Harper with the Stephens County Court Clerk's office said. Two other teens -- James Edwards Jr., 15, and Chancey Luna, 16 -- also face felony first-degree murder charges in the case. They are scheduled to appear in court on November 20, Harper said. Authorities accuse the teens of gunning down Christopher Lane, a 23-year-old Australian student who attended East Central University on a baseball scholarship. Lane was jogging in Duncan, Oklahoma, in August when he was shot in the back. 911 caller: Oklahoma killing may be gang-related . Prosecutors allege that Luna pulled the trigger and Jones drove the getaway car, CNN affiliate KOCO reported. Police have said that Jones later told them, ""We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody."" Asked outside the courtroom Wednesday whether they had any response to the new charge against their son, Jones' parents declined to comment to KOCO. The senselessness of the killing caused outrage in Australia and the United States, with former Australian deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer calling for a boycott on travel to the United States in response and President Barack Obama expressing his condolences to Lane's family. Suspect tweeted 'time to start taken life's' The case also prompted speculation the killing may have been racially motivated, as one of the alleged shooters, who is black, had allegedly made online comments about disliking white people. District Attorney Jason Hicks said while the post appeared racial in character, there was insufficient evidence to pursue hate crime charges in the case. On Wednesday, a judge issued a gag order, preventing both sides in the case from talking about it publicly, according to KOCO.","Prosecutors charge Michael Jones, 17, with first-degree murder .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- In a world where so much goes to waste without a moment's thought, Kenyan artist Njee Muturi has made a livelihood out of upcycling rejected cutlery and transforming it into striking and inimitable jewelry. Out of old and unwanted knives, forks and spoons, Muturi crafts artistic and unique rings, bracelets, necklaces, as well as other household items. From his Nairobi home he trades under the name ""Zanji Art,"" derived from Arabic, meaning ""Black Art."" ""Everywhere you go you will find that there's something that people throw away and they don't know it can be used,"" he says. Muturi gets the old tableware sent to him in bulk from sources abroad, particularly his brother, a fellow artist. Friends or contacts entering Kenya bring the cutlery into the country, and Muturi pays the duty tax at the airport. Read more: The teenager who makes jewelry from bullets . He sorts it, choosing which items he can work with and putting the rest aside. He then proceeds to clean them and take them to his workshop within the Kibera slum where he solders them, before returning to his apartment to craft the pieces. Once he is done forming the pieces, he then has to tumble them and polish them in order to give them a clean finish and fresh appearance. ""Before I never used to clean them I just used to make it and sell it but I find most people they want to see it's new,"" he explains. Read this: Artist gives 'trash a second chance' His workspace is his apartment, where an array of forks, spoons and knives are scattered on the floor, and both finished and unfinished projects dangle on the walls. It is in this pleasantly jumbled cavern, which serves as both his office and shop, that Muturi sells his jewelry. Each piece is exclusive because of the original distinctive design of the cutlery he uses. ""I think it's fun when you come here and then you see other things, because in the market, there you can't put everything,"" he says. An experienced craftsman, Muturi makes the pieces with skilled efficiency; the rings take between five and 10 minutes to make, while the larger, more complicated pieces take between 30 minutes and one hour. ""It's easy for me,"" says Muturi. ""I see it, I see what I can do even before I start making it."" Read more: Jewelry made from boiled bones . Muturi sells his durable pieces at competitive prices ranging from $5-10 for the smaller pieces, such as the rings, and $20-40 for the bigger pieces, like the weighty necklaces and bracelets.

It's not the usual 'walk into a shop, pick a ring, head to the counter and walk out.' ""I wouldn't change anything about the pieces, the moment you do it's no longer Muturi's"" Muturi hopes to expand his possibilities in future and has already begun working on sculptures made out of cutlery and even masks made out of old trays.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Southern California high school sports team is not scoring any points for its name, the Arabs. In a letter this month, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee accused Coachella Valley High School of stereotyping and demanded a name change. The group also is seeking a change of the school mascot. The group said it was ""shocked to learn that the Arab"" is the official mascot of the high school in Thermal. ""Continued use of the 'Arab' mascot perpetuates demeaning stereotypes of Arabs and Arab Americans,"" it said. ""Coachella Valley High School's gross stereotyping cannot be tolerated."" The school has a mascot that ""depicts a man with a large nose, heavy beard, and wearing"" a traditional head covering, the group said. During halftime, ""a female dressed as belly dancer entertains the mascot by dancing for him,"" it added. But for the school, the mascot and cheerleaders shouting ""Let's go, Arabs, let's go"" are nothing new. The mascot dates back to the 1930s. Coachella Valley Unified School District Superintendent Darryl Adams says he is taking the concerns seriously. He believes his school district and the civil rights group can come to a compromise by altering the mascot's caricature and removing features that insult Arab-Americans. ""It's not so much the name but the depiction of the mascot,"" Adams said. ""I'm from Memphis, Tennessee, so I understand how people can look at different symbols and caricatures. I look at it as an educational opportunity for our students and staff to discuss it. ""Things evolve over time, and it's the 21st Century and it's 2013, and this group feels we need to look at it and we will,"" Adams said. The Arab mascot recognizes the influences of the Middle East in the area's date farming, said Rich Ramirez, president of the Coachella Valley High School Alumni Association and a 1959 graduate of the high school. In the early 1900s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture acquired date shoots from Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries and used them to establish date orchards in the valley's desert climate, Ramirez said. Some of the valley's Arab-Americans -- largely of Lebanese background -- were involved in date farming, but they mostly ran men's apparel stores and groceries, Ramirez said. By 1921, the valley held its first date festival in Indio, and people who dressed in Arabian style were admitted free to the festival, he said. The Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival now attracts 300,000 people over 10 days every February, said Ramirez, a former board member of the Coachella Valley History Museum. Dates became a boon to the valley more than 90 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The Coachella Valley, a popular winter retreat that includes Palm Springs, now produces 95% of the country's dates in two dozen varieties, Ramirez said. Middle Eastern influences are also reflected in community names of Mecca, Oasis and Arabia. The city of Coachella has street names of Damascus and Baghdad, and the valley's largest city, Indio, has a street named Deglet Noor, a date variety, Ramirez said. By 1931, the high school adopted the mascot name of Arabs, replacing the informal names of ""date pickers"" or ""farmers"" inspired by the area's industry. It was a common way of nicknaming communities then, much like the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers, Ramirez said. ""We're proud of Arab tradition and Arab culture,"" Ramirez said. The high school band and drill team dresses in Arab style, and a girl in a genie costume dances during football halftimes, Ramirez said. Ramirez wants the school to keep the Arab mascot, but he's willing to change the facial features, he said. ""The comment they make is that it has a hook-nose Arab. We have been using the snarling face to instill fear in the opponent. That's what a mascot does. But we can put a handsome dude in the mascot,"" Ramirez said. He noted how the community stood up for Arabs shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""Work with us. Don't come off like we're something terrible. We're not terrible. When 9/11 came, we got terrible, terrible threats to change the name of our mascot. We said no. ""People love the name; they love the culture; they love our date festival,"" he added. The school district and the national group are meeting to see whether a resolution can be made, the affiliate reported. The issue will also be discussed at a board meeting November 21. Superintendent Adams will brief the board in closed session on the potential legal implications of the mascot, but he expects there will be many public comments during the open board meeting, he said. It is unclear whether anything will change before the next game Friday night. A slur or term of 'honor'?

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A dozen old family photos were strewn across the table as Gary Neal picked them up one by one. Gary Neal lost his son Harrison to a prescription drug overdose at age 17. The attorney from Tulsa, Oklahoma, reminisced about his teenage son, Harrison, who died two years ago at the age of 17 after fatally mixing over-the-counter cold medication and someone else's prescription painkillers. ""There's nothing worse as a parent than to see your kid on a gurney being rolled out of your house ... and placed in a hearse,"" Neal, 61, lamented. ""There's nothing worse than that."" Hoping to get the word out that in the wrong hands, prescription drugs can be deadly, Neal joined forces this year with the New York-based Partnership for a Drug-Free America. ""We have 20 percent of our teenagers, one in five, who have admitted to abusing a prescription medication,"" said Steve Pasierb, president of the organization. ""We know that is based on their attitudes and beliefs that this is safer."" Pasierb's group, along with drug maker Abbott, launched an anti-drug campaign this summer called Not in My House. Health Minute: Watch more on one father's quest to raise awareness » . The Internet-based educational campaign is aimed at educating not just teens but their parents about the dangers of prescription medications. ""This is unlike any drug issue we've ever dealt with,"" Pasierb explained. ""Supply can be controlled in our own house. We're not talking about Afghanistan or Colombia. We're talking about your house and my house."" Neal learned that his son started experimenting with drugs such as marijuana when he was 15. ""It was one of those things I wasn't happy about, but I didn't think it was the end of the world."" Neal restricted Harrison's after-school activities, but he said that when the behavior continued, he ordered his son to submit to home and professional drug tests. He also enrolled Harrison in an outpatient drug treatment program the summer before his death. Neal suspected that the problems weren't behind them, but he was unaware that the teen was abusing prescription drugs. ""I don't think he knew that his abuse of these prescription drugs would be deadly,"" Neal added. That's part of the problem being addressed by Pasierb's group. ""It's this belief that they've found something safe. 'Grandma uses it. I can take a couple from her bottle,' "" Pasierb explained. ""When they're not used with a prescription and the way they are intended, prescription drugs can be every bit as dangerous, every bit as addictive, every bit as deadly as illegal street drugs."" What's more, Pasierb said, ""Over the past eight to 10 years, adolescent substance abuse, teen drinking and teen smoking have all been in a steady decline. The only thing that has been resistant to that progress has been prescription drug abuse."" Pasierb put part of the blame on parents. The drugs of choice when they were young tended to be illegal ones: marijuana, heroin, cocaine. ""This idea of purposely abusing prescription drugs didn't go on when they were teenagers themselves,"" he said. Part of the Not in My House campaign appeals directly to parents to take action starting with their own medicine cabinets. ""When we get them the message, a light bulb goes off and they are immediately mobilized,"" Pasierb said. ""They go home, they clean out their medicine cabinet ... and they talk with their kids."" Specifically, the Not in My House campaign recommended that parents take an inventory of prescription medications at home, counting pills left in the bottle or package after every use. Medications should be stored in a safe place that is not readily accessible to everyone in the house. Finally, leftover or expired prescription pills should be disposed of properly. Experts cautioned not to flush medications down the toilet where they could harm the water supply but to place drugs in a an opaque container with something unpleasant mixed in, such as cat litter. The bottle should be sealed and placed in the trash. With the second anniversary of Harrison Neal's death approaching, his father still has a lot of questions and doubts. ""Could I have done it better? Could I have done it different? Would the results have been different? You never know the answers to those questions because you never get a second chance. ""I've lamented his death every second since he died and will live with it the rest of my life.""","One in five teens has admitted to abusing a prescription medication .

"(CNN) -- Midway through Jason Dinant's fitness journey to get six-pack abs by June, the 27-year-old had a breakdown. Halfway through his fitness goal,  Jason Dinant said he sees a four-pack gradually forming. After months of eschewing junk food in favor of lean protein -- egg whites, chicken breast and vegetables -- he devoured pie. The slice came from Marie Callender's, drizzled with caramel, loaded with candied apples and layered with cream cheese. Yes, it was delicious, Dinant said. Then he got home and had a Tootsie Roll. Then, he ate a Klondike ice cream bar. The breakdown came late February after months of following a lean diet. It also came with consequences. ""When I woke up the next day, I had a horrible stomach  ache,"" Dinant said. ""My trainer said once you're on the diet, you can try to go back and have a day where you binge on bad food and it's going to give you a stomach ache."" Since January, CNNhealth has been following the progress of three iReport contributors as they strive to meet their New Year's diet and fitness goals. One of them is Dinant, a Las Vegas, Nevada resident, who wanted to get a six-pack by summer in time for his 10-year high school reunion.  He also wants to show off a chiseled stomach on his blog called ""Naked Boy News,"" where he stands shirtless to give ""the naked truth about today's news."" The junk food breakdown came after almost two months of staying on a lean diet.  The self-described ""candyaholic"" often craved his favorite treats like York Peppermint patties, macaroons, Mounds bars and Coca Cola. ""The key to falling off the wagon is not to stay off the wagon,"" said Gregg Avedon, a certified fitness trainer and model whose chiseled six-pack has appeared on the cover of Men's Health magazine 18 times. ""If you fall off the wagon for one day, the problem is it could lead to two days, three days, a week, then you fall off completely. Next thing you know, it leads to two weeks of binge eating."" Dinant has maintained his diet of 16 egg whites, one and a quarter-pound of meat, four cups of vegetables, potatoes and rice a day. He treats himself to one Tootsie Roll a day, and sometimes indulges in gelato. Dinant's quest for six-pack abs -- which initially included 500 daily crunches  -- brought attention from his neighbors, an egg company that ships him 15 dozen eggs every two weeks and news media such as USA Today and his hometown newspaper, Las Vegas Review-Journal and blogs. Some people left words of encouragement for Dinant's quest for tight abs, but others were less supportive. A picture compared him to a toothpick. Another one showed a kitten shooting a shirtless Dinant. ""A lot of people said, 'You need to put on a shirt,'"" he said, so Dinant set up a Web site called putonashirt.com where he compiled the comments. The hate mail comes ""when they see a thin guy trying to be more fit. They're jealous,"" Dinant said. The negative comments add fuel to his fire. ""I've wanted to do this before and last year, I had the same resolution,"" Dinant said.  ""I did it for two weeks and by January 15, it was time to move on. So I applied for iReport. I wanted people to follow it, so I'm motivated to do it.  So many people are watching, so mentally, I have to do it. I put my mind to it. I have to do it."" Watch Dinant's video . Dinant doesn't have a six-pack yet. ""You can see four,"" he said.  ""It's more defined. The middle two are coming in. I need a tan. I'm so white it's hard to see."" In January, Dinant's exercise regimen started with 500 stomach crunches a day, after hearing a Britney Spears interview about her sit-ups for toned abs.  Dinant has abandoned the crunches and enlisted a personal trainer who has designed 11 core body exercises. For 20 minutes, Dinant performs 25 repetitions of the exercises, which include a floor bicycle, upward leg lifts and a type of sit-up where he lifts his legs and arms up at the same time. He spends an hour jogging, doing cardio and lifting weights.  He also changes his exercise routines and works out four to five times a week. Recently, Dinant lost his job in sales for a Las Vegas show, which he attributes to a sluggish economy.  He still has his job as an emcee for a night club and on the bright side, he said he ""can dedicate more time to work out."" ""I'm working out my legs and arms to burn the calories, to lose the layer of fat,"" he said. ""I don't want to plateau and have a two-pack."" Many fitness fanatics do the same exercises and never see improvements because they plateau, said Avedon, a trainer in Sunrise, Florida. ""In the gym, you need to change the factors of what you're doing,"" he said.  ""If you're doing heavy weights and lower reps, you can change to more moderate weights and moderate repetitions.  You can change exercises, do different types of cardio. It's creating change. The body adapts to change quickly and responds really well when you hit a plateau."" At the same time, some people have difficulty getting a six pack, because of elevated levels of cortisol which can lead to belly fat, said Avedon, author of ""Muscle Chow: More Than 150 Meals to Feed Your Muscles and Fuel Your Workouts."" ""You've got to make sure the cortisol level is not elevated,"" he said. ""One way is proper sleep and reducing stress."" Before blaming hormones for flab, Avedon warned, ""you really need to make sure you're doing all the right things first. So many people don't take accountability."" The good news for Dinant is that the hardest part is getting the initial six pack and afterwards, it gets easier. ""There's a big learning curve,"" Avedon said.  ""Granted there are people who can eat pizza and can get a six-pack.  For people struggling to get a six pack, you learn to eat properly, get in a gym and be consistent. You know what you need to do. Definitely, it would be easier to maintain it and more difficult to obtain it in the beginning.""","iReporter Jason Dinant on a quest for six-pack abs has sweet tooth binge .

"Washington (CNN) -- Security is an elusive thing for journalists, women in particular. Every year, the International Women's Media Foundation honors four women journalists for their courage in reporting the news and promoting the advancement of women in the news media. During the last 25 years, 100 women from all over the world have been recognized with the IWMF's Courage in Journalism and Lifetime Achievement Awards. This year's honorees have travelled from Afghanistan, Cambodia, Syria, and Zimbabwe to receive their Awards in Los Angeles. Najiba Ayubi is the director of The Killid Group, a media organization that in cooperation with affiliated outlets broadcasts news in all provinces of Afghanistan. Ayubi has confronted numerous terrifying experiences in her 25 years as a journalist, including gunmen at her house, defamation in state-run media, and lawsuits by members of parliament. Nour Kelze became a photojournalist for Reuters in Aleppo after the conflict in Syria began, and has been covering the front lines of the revolution at great risk to her reputation and life. Bopha Phorn, an editor for The Cambodia Daily in Phnom Penh, is not only one of very few female journalists in Cambodia, she is also one of very few journalists who investigate corruption and power abuse in Cambodia. In 2012, Phorn was investigating illegal logging in the Cambodian jungle and barely escaped death when gunmen opened fire on the car she was traveling in. An environmental activist who was with her was killed. Zimbabwean journalist Edna Machirori, who is being honored with the IWMF Lifetime Achievement Award, started her career in journalism 50 years ago, before Zimbabwe's independence, and later became the country's first female black newspaper editor. The Award ceremony on Tuesday will be co-hosted by actress Olivia Wilde and Glamour magazine's editor-in-chief Cindi Leive. Award presenters will include Marcia Gay Harden and Maria Shriver.","Some of the bravest women journalists are being honored at an awards night in Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- Our democracy is endangered. Not by the Russians, North Korea, the Iran regime, or even terrorists. To quote Pogo: ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" Inside the beltway, the fingers point and the media tuts and struts in glee, and we, the American public, respond by becoming more rigid and divided ourselves. No more ""truth springing from argument amongst friends,"" as David Hume said. A recent nonpartisan Pew Research Poll finds our knee-jerk partisanship has increased dramatically. This road we're on will lead us step-by-step to an extreme: either an autocratic government that functions, or a dysfunctional anarchy. The petty squabbles, bilge in the name of party or principle, will dissolve our self-government. Abraham Lincoln felt no foreign power could ever defeat the United States. He said, ""From whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some trans-Atlantic military giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never...No, if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men we will live forever or die by suicide."" We're pointing a pistol at our heads. A government of, by, and for the people requires that people talk to people, that we can agree to disagree but do so in civility. If we let the politicians and those who report dictate our discourse, then our course will be dictated. Why am I alarmed? Because two ""scandals"" -- the IRS tax-exempt inquiries and the Department of Justice's tapping of reporters' phones -- have become lynch parties. And the congressional investigation of Benghazi may become a scandal in itself. The IRS scandal has sparked bipartisan outrage that should require a bipartisan solution. The director who oversaw this was a Bush appointee who was confirmed by a Democratic Congress. Even Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein says he doubts very much that Obama was involved . We, the people, need to stay focused on facts, causes and solutions. Let's begin with the findings of the Treasury's inspector general who uncovered it: That it was bureaucratic mismanagement, but that there was no evidence of any political motivation or influence from outside the IRS. And that, according to acting Commissioner Steven Miller, who just resigned, the problem started because the Supreme Court's Citizens' United decision created a surge of requests by political groups for tax-exempt status. Democrats and Republicans agree there's a problem. Maybe they should focus on solutions. Let's demand an end to partisan sideshows or media witch hunts: It turns out that the leaked White House Benghazi e-mails which allegedly show a coverup of a terrorist attack were themselves altered. Those e-mails are, in a word, bogus . Next up on the playbill: The Department of Justice secretly obtained dozens of reporters' phone records because of a serious security leak. The double contradictory shell game we're supposed to believe: Obama is not in charge and he has his finger in every pot. This bamboozling of the American people obscures the main point: How do we safeguard American lives and respect our freedoms at the same time? Maybe working together -- Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals -- the Media Shield Law, a solution to the problem, can be passed. Both the Democrats and Republicans have run roughshod over our separation of powers. Both parties have misused and abused their constitutional powers. Democrats blocked, again and again, President Bush's nominees for federal judges. Today, Republicans aren't just blocking Obama's judicial nominees, they're blocking the Senate from considering laws and blocking Cabinet appointees necessary for the federal government to run. Why should we allow any political party or personality to render our government unable to govern? On 9/11 terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and tried to attack the U.S. Capitol building in order to destroy our institutions, our economic strength, our military and our democratic Congress where ""the people rule."" But in our partisan self-righteousness, we're destroying our foundations of government more effectively than al Qaeda ever could. Whether it's the media or the politicians, the churning of partisan passion into anger, indeed hate, has an ulterior purpose: If Obama's administration is constantly engaged in fighting for its existence, the governing comes to a halt, and his agenda will go nowhere. Aiming for that and little if nothing else weakens and harms our democratic institutions, both Congress and the presidency. Remember, Obama was elected by a bigger margin than George W. Bush. He deserves to have his appointees, and he deserves to have votes on the issues, to have the government function, and to fight for the policies on which he was elected. By allowing problems to become scandals and scandals to become demagoguery, we're shooting ourselves in the foot. If it keeps up, we will all be complicit in weakening our democracy. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Knee-jerk partisanship is worse than ever in politics and public discourse .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department has reached a settlement with American Airlines and US Airways that requires them to sell facilities at seven airports in order to complete their planned $11 billion merger to create the world's biggest carrier.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- JetBlue Airways and two TSA screeners will pay $240,000 to settle an Iraqi man's claim he was denied access to a flight until he covered a T-shirt that read in English and Arabic, ""We Will Not be Silent."" JetBlue and two TSA screeners settled a lawsuit for $240,000, but denied any wrongdoing. In the settlement, JetBlue and the TSA screeners deny any wrongdoing, saying they only wanted to resolve the 2½-year-old federal lawsuit. But Raed Jarrar, an Iraqi who immigrated to the United States three years ago, cast the settlement as a victory, saying the payout would discourage airlines and airport security officials from imposing restrictions in the future. ACLU attorney Aden Fine, who represented Jarrar, also called it a victory. ""A $240,000 award should send a clear and strong message to all TSA officials and to all airlines that what happened here is wrong and should not happen again,"" he said. The TSA screeners -- Garfield Harris and Franco Trotta -- declined comment, referring questions to their attorneys, who also declined comment, and the TSA. TSA spokesman Christopher White, while noting that the TSA was not a party to the suit, said ""There is absolutely no intention to take disciplinary action against the employees involved."" The incident occurred August 12, 2006 -- two days after the United Kingdom revealed a plot to bomb planes to the United States had been foiled. In response, the United States imposed a ban on carry-on liquids, and raised the threat level at airports. Jarrar, now 30, said he was attempting to travel on JetBlue flight 101 from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Oakland, California, when he was approached by TSA officers. The officers told him he'd have to cover his T-shirt. ""When I asked why, one of the TSA officers said, 'Coming into an airport while wearing a T-shirt with Arabic letters on it was equivalent to going into a bank while wearing a shirt saying, 'I am a robber,' "" Jarrar said. Jarrar said he originally refused to cover up the shirt, first asking to speak to a supervisor, and asking if there was a law prohibiting Arabic shirts. ""I said, 'I think as a U.S. resident and taxpayer, I think it's my constitutional right [to express myself],' "" said Jarrar, adding the T-shirt's message was not threatening. Jarrar said he finally relented when it became obvious he couldn't get on the plane without complying. The officials purchased a T-shirt for him to wear, he said. ""They had actually a discussion in front of me. One said, 'Let's buy an ""I [heart] New York"" shirt.' And another said, 'No, we can't take him from one extreme to another.' "" ""I said, 'What makes you assume that I don't love New York?' "" Jarrar said they eventually bought him a ""generic gray"" T-shirt with the words ""New York"" on it. ""They tried to say this is a compromise ... I said, 'It is not a compromise, you are denying me my rights,' "" Jarrar said. Airline officials also changed his seats without consulting him, forcing him to to sit in the back where flight attendants kept an eye on him, Jarrar claims. According to court documents, TSA screener Trotta said he remembers Harris telling Jarrar he ""had perhaps not made the best choice of clothing"" given the events two days earlier. But ""at no point in time did he ever request or order that the passenger change his shirt or suggest that his failure to do so"" would keep him off the flight. Jarrar said he is disappointed the TSA and airline did not apologize to him. In a written statement to CNN, JetBlue said it was pleased with the settlement. ""The settlement amount represents a fraction of the amount originally sought by Mr. Jarrar,"" spokesman Bryan Baldwin said. ""JetBlue continues to deny, outright, every critical aspect of Mr. Jarrar's version of events."" ""At no time did anyone from JetBlue ever say he could not board the aircraft unless he changed his T-shirt,"" Baldwin said. ACLU attorney Fine said Jarrar did not sue TSA directly because of ""legal considerations."" ""It's much more difficult to sue a government agency than it is to sue the direct government employee that committed the unconstitutional act,"" he said. But the JetBlue settlement should accomplish the same goal, he said. ""It's very difficult to bring these kinds of cases and to prevail on these kinds of cases, especially in a post 9/11 world in which airline officials and government officials have been given an extreme amount of latitude,"" Fine said. Jarrar said the slogan on the T-shirt -- ""We Will Not Be Silent"" -- originated in Germany as a campaign against the Nazi repression. He said artists in New York have printed it in various languages.","JetBlue and the TSA screeners denied any wrongdoing .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- JoÃ£o Rodrigo Silva Santos didn't come home Monday night. When the former professional footballer's wife opened the door on her way to work the next morning, she found his severed head on their front step. The head was inside a backpack, police said. Santos' eyes and tongue had been gouged out, according to Brazilian media reports. Player stabbed, referee dismembered over soccer quarrel in Brazil . Now police in Rio de Janeiro are investigating the grisly killing, though they haven't said who they believe is behind it. Santos, 35, was a forward for a number of mostly second-tier Rio de Janeiro football teams before retiring and opening a health foods store. His death comes at a time when football fans worldwide are shifting their focus toward Brazil, which will host the World Cup in 2014. Late last year, the country announced it was pumping $900 million dollars into its security budget to make the competition ""one of the most protected sports events in history."" World football's ruling body FIFA had expressed concern about Brazil's increasing crime rate, particularly in Sao Paulo. One police official told Brazil's O Globo newspaper that authorities are investigating whether a recent post on the store's Facebook page could be connected to the crime. The post showed surveillance footage and asked for help catching shoplifters. Police plan to compare the images to surveillance footage taken at the shop Monday night, chief homicide investigator Rafael Rangel told the newspaper. The former football player was last seen Monday night, when two suspects entered his vehicle, CNN affiliate TV Record reported. On Wednesday morning, police said they found parts of a man's body in a river outside the city and were testing the DNA to see whether the remains belong to Santos, TV Record said. Authorities have interviewed 10 witnesses so far in the case, police said. According to local media, Santos' wife, Geisa Silva, worked for the police in one of Rio's shantytowns, but as a social worker giving swimming lessons to children, not as a policewoman. She told investigators she did not know of any threats made against her husband, according to TV Record. Some of Santos' relatives and neighbors told O Globo that he didn't have any enemies and said they didn't know what could have motivated the attack. Brazil boosts World Cup security budget as crime rises . Santos started his football career when he was 16 years old, and played for several Brazilian club teams. He played for the Bangu club team from 1996 to 2005, according to a biography on the club's unofficial website. In 1998, he played for Honduras' Olimpia club. And in 2003 he played for Sweden's Oster club, the website says. The website calls Santos a ""humble hero,"" describing how goals he scored brought victory to another club team he joined. According to the FutRio.net football news site, Santos left the field earlier this year to focus on his business. The site reported that club players in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday honored Santos with a minute of silence. CNN's Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta. CNN's Kevin Gallagher contributed to this report.","NEW: Local media report that Santos left the field this year to focus on his business .

He said a male passenger managed to pull a female passenger to safety before the plane was engulfed by flames. Two pilots and three passengers died. They were not identified. McDonough said everyone aboard was a Canadian citizen. The 19-passenger Metro Fairchild had taken off from Sioux Lookout. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said its investigators would arrive at the scene Monday.","Bearskin Airlines flight crashes just short of runway in Red Lake, Ontario .

"(CNN) -- ""It could have been the secret to my success or the secret to my demise,"" a wistful Serena Williams says of her 2013 season. The irresistible force in women's tennis is talking about her record-breaking year, one in which she vowed to play more than she ever had done previously. It was a decision that paid huge dividends. Not only did her victories at the French Open and U.S. Open take her grand slam tally to 17, she also successfully defended her season-ending WTA Championships crown. She claimed 11 titles in 2013 -- the best return in the women's game for 16 years -- adding $12.3 million in prize money to what has become a very healthy bank balance over the years. Far from slowing down, Williams has a new spring in her step at the age of 32. Her 17 major titles mean she is just one behind Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova and within sight of Steffi Graf, out in front on 22 grand slam titles in the post-1968 Open era. ""It is getting exciting,"" Williams told CNN. ""I have four grand slams next year to try and at least catch up with Martina and Chrissy so it will be really exciting. ""Hopefully I can do it but really being here 17 is fun, obviously I want more and I never want to stop until I reach my goals. ""I'm excited about just looking forward to the possibilities of next year. ""I started with 15 and this year I'm starting with 17 (next year) so hopefully I can win a couple -- one, two or three, who knows? Any would be good for me."" Serena's career has been transformed since she teamed up with coach Patrick Moratoglou after a demoralizing first round defeat at the 2012 French Open. Having tumbled to 175 in the world after a series of injury-hit seasons, he helped Serena roar back to the top of the game; if and when Serena breaks 18, his pride will be immeasurable too. ""Martina and Chris, they are legends, so to have Serena part of this small group means a lot,"" Frenchman Moratoglou said. ""It means a lot to her too that she's only one grand slam away to reach them and then maybe to overtake them it's an option that you can really think about it. ""There will be a lot of emotion when she'll be close to winning the next grand slam and sitting next to those great champions, but she can make it. ""Steffi is a bit far away still. I think it's too early to speak about Steffi -- she has 22 -- so (Serena) has to win five more and six more to overtake Steffi so that's a long way. ""I think it's important not to look at the mountain when you want to climb it, just the next step."" Moratoglou is from the school of thought that a defeat, however painful, can provide an important reality check and provoke an elite athlete into a drive to ensure it isn't repeated. That pivotal reverse to Virginie Razzano at the French Open last year spurred Williams on to a spike in form and another shock grand slam exit -- to Sabine Lisicki at Wimbledon this year -- acted as a similar catalyst. ""It was definitely motivating -- I definitely learnt a lot from that match,"" Williams explains of her defeat to the German in round four. ""It wasn't good that I lost but it was good that I was able to learn from that loss and I was able to do better and I won some matches because of that loss so I guess it helped me out."" And though Serena is quick to pay tribute to her team from agent to coach, hitting partner to physio, she also revealed that she still leans on the support of her mum, who was with her during her triumphant WTA Championships campaign, and dad to help her game. She said: ""I called my dad every match at the U.S. Open from the third round on, he really helped me in that tournament, and he really helped me behind the scenes to win some matches. ""I was really happy to have the support and have his help and so yeah I definitely rely on my dad and my dad for a lot of coaching.""","Serena Williams tells CNN 2013 season was make or break for her career .

"(CNN) -- It was a routine display, a predictable result perhaps, but in beating Augsburg 3-0 on Saturday Bayern Munich created history registering a 37th consecutive Bundesliga game without defeat. Since Bayer Leverkusen beat Bayern 2-1 on October 28th last year, the Bavarian side have notched up an incredible 31 league wins and six draws. ""The record is unbelievable. It's not easy to go 37 games without defeat. Congratulations to the club,"" said coach Pep Guardiola, who took over from Jupp Heynckes in June. ""I have noticed that every game is a lesson for me in understanding my team,"" he added. The record, which surpasses the mark set by Hamburg between January 1982 to January 1983, was achieved with the minimum of fuss at the Allianz Arena. Jerome Boateng opened the scoring in the fourth minute before Franck Ribery added a second three minutes before halftime. A Thomas Muller penalty in the 90th minute sealed victory for Bayern who also equaled Barcelona's Champions League record (set in 2002/03) of nine consecutive wins with a 1-0 at Viktoria Pilsen in midweek. Domestic joy was heightened by the knowledge that their lead at the top of the table had been extended to four points as title rivals Borussia Dortmund completed a miserable week at home and in Europe. Jurgen Klopp's men followed a 1-0 Champions League defeat to English league leaders Arsenal with a 2-1 loss at Wolfsburg. German international Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead with a well-struck free kick just before the break, but Wolfsburg hit back with two second half goals from Ricardo Rodriguez and Croatia striker Ivica Olic to register a fourth straight victory which moves them up to fifth in the table. ""We gave away too many free-kicks, which allowed the opposition some practice in taking them,"" Jurgen Klopp said. To compound Dortmund's trouble, center-back Neven Subotic suffered suspected ligament damage to his knee. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen's resounding 5-3 win against Hamburg sees them draw level on 28 points with Dortmund while Hertha Berlin bounced back after two straight league defeats with a 3-2 win at Hoffenheim. The victory lifts Hertha to seventh, one place below Schalke who beat Werder Bremen 3-1. Fourth-placed Borussia Monchengladbach beat bottom side Nurnberg 3-1. Mourinho's lucky escape . Meanwhile in the English Premier League, Chelsea were held to a 2-2 draw against West Bromwich Albion. Only an injury time penalty by Belgian striker Eden Hazard preserved Jose Mourinho's record of never having lost a league match at Stamford Bridge. Samuel Eto gave the hosts the lead in the 45th minute but second-half strikes from Shane Long and Stephane Sessegnon looked to have secured a famous victory for the visitors only for the Blues to equalize at the death. The result sees Chelsea drop to fourth while West Brom are up to ninth. Southampton's amazing run of form continued in emphatic style with 4-1 win over Hull. The Saints, whose last league defeat was in August, move up to third. Luis Suarez scored a second-half brace as Liverpool thrashed Fulham 4-0 at Anfield. The win sees the Reds move to within two points of leaders Arsenal who travel to Manchester United on Sunday. In Saturday's other fixtures, Aston Villa beat Cardiff 2-0, Norwich City beat West Ham United 3-1 and bottom-of-the-table Crystal Palace drew 0-0 with Everton.","Bayern Munich create Bundesliga history with a 3-0 win over Augsburg .

"(CNN) -- It's a startlingly familiar story: a violent crash during a car race sends debris hurtling into the stands. Spectators scatter, some are hurt. It happened again Sunday at IndyCar's Grand Prix of Houston, where 13 spectators were injured when two cars bumped in the final lap of the race, sending one sailing into a protective fence while the other spun out, shearing off part of its side of sending debris toward the grandstands. One of the drivers, three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti, suffered spinal and ankle injuries and was hospitalized. The incident comes eight months after a February accident during a NASCAR race at Daytona International Speedway that spewed debris into the stands, injuring 28 fans. In March two people, a driver and a 14-year-old boy who was standing in the pit area of a California racetrack, died in an accident during warm-ups. While it appears no one keeps comprehensive statistics, the Charlotte Observer newspaper reported in 2011 that 46 spectators had died at U.S. race tracks between 1990 and 2010. The newspaper did not track injuries. PRESS Inc., a racing safety company, cites insurance industry sources as saying 2,000 spectators are injured in a year. In a statement issued Monday, IndyCar said it ""is thoroughly reviewing the incident. Reducing the risks that are associated with racing is one of our highest priorities and receives our constant and on-going focus."" The issue of fan safety has long been on IndyCar's agenda. The issue was amplified two years ago, when two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon died after his car struck a fence support during a race in Las Vegas. Last year, a league consultant said the league was committed to investigating ways to better design barriers to prevent crash debris from reaching fans, according to IndyCar.com. And in May, league CEO Mark Miles said executives would look at new safety initiatives, including the possibility of new types of fences, more safety precautions near where drivers stop for service and repairs, and driver safety enhancements. NASCAR took similar safety precautions after February's wreck at Daytona International Speedway by adding extra cables on crossover gates and tethering frames of gates to posts. CNN's Dan Moriarity contributed to this report.","Fan safety is again in the spotlight after the Houston crash .

"London (CNN) -- Significant progress was reportedly made last weekend in Geneva toward a landmark nuclear agreement with Iran. And, as talks concluded on November 10, U.S. Secretary of John Kerry announced that negotiations will start again on November 20. Despite the concerns of regional U.S. allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, and also a significant number of legislators in the U.S. Congress, it is clear that the Obama administration is pushing strongly for deal as part of its wider Middle Eastern strategy. Indeed, Kerry has now spent more time negotiating with counterpart Iranian officials than any other U.S. high-level engagement for perhaps three decades. The seriousness of negotiations was emphasized by the fact that, as well as Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif, foreign ministers from Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany and France, and the Chinese deputy foreign minister, came together. If agreement can be reached, an interim deal (potentially setting the ground for a later comprehensive agreement) would reportedly see Iran's nuclear capacity capped for six months and opened up to U.N. inspections. In exchange, Iran would be given limited, sequenced relief from sanctions. Remaining disagreements reportedly include the status of the Arak heavy-water reactor, and production of highly enriched uranium -- both processes, that can potentially be used to produce nuclear weapons. A second problem to resolve is how to handle the existing Iranian stockpile of uranium that Iran enriched to 20%. IAEA signs cooperation deal with Tehran . Progress in nuclear diplomacy with Iran, combined with continued uncertainty in Syria and Egypt, has refocused Washington's attention towards the Middle East in a manner unanticipated by Obama only a few months ago. In addition to Syria and Egypt, the administration has spent significant political capital resuming Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The urgency of U.S. focus there reflects growing international conviction that, 20 years after the Oslo Process began, the ""window of opportunity"" for securing a two-state solution may be receding. Intensified U.S. focus on the Middle East has accentuated a shift, common to many recent re-elected presidents, of increased focus on foreign policy in second terms of office. In part, this reflects the fact that presidents often see foreign policy as key to the legacy they wish to build. For instance, after the 2001 terrorist attacks, George W. Bush sought to spread his freedom agenda across the Middle East. Bill Clinton also devoted significant time to trying to secure a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. As important as an Iran nuclear agreement might prove to be, the Middle East is one of only two regions in which Obama is looking for legacy. Since he was elected in 2008, Asia in general, and China in particular, has assumed greater importance in U.S. policy. To this end, Obama is seeking to continue the so-called pivot towards Asia-Pacific through landmark initiatives like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Key threats, however, remain on the horizon to securing this re-orientation. These include a dramatic, sustained escalation of tension in the Middle East (perhaps in Syria or Egypt); and/or the remaining possibility of further terrorist attacks on the U.S. homeland. As well as legacy-building, the likelihood of Obama concentrating more on foreign policy also reflects domestic U.S. politics. Particularly the intense polarization and gridlock of Washington. Since re-election, Obama has achieved little domestic policy success. His gun control bill was defeated, immigration reform faces significant opposition in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, and the prospect of a long-term federal budgetary ""grand bargain"" with Congress looks unlikely. Moreover, implementation of his landmark healthcare initiative has been botched. Many re-elected presidents in the post-war era have, like Obama, found it difficult to acquire domestic policy momentum. In part, this is because the party of re-elected presidents, as with the Democrats now, often hold a weaker position in Congress. Thus Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, Richard Nixon in 1972, and Bill Clinton in 1996 were all re-elected alongside Congresses where both the House and Senate were controlled by their partisan opponents. Another factor encouraging foreign policy focus in second terms is the fact that re-elected presidents have often been impacted by domestic scandals in recent decades. Thus, Watergate ended the Nixon administration in 1974, Iran-Contra badly damaged the Reagan White House, and the Lewinsky scandal led to Clinton being impeached. Since Obama's re-election, a series of problems have hit the administration. These include revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted some conservative groups for special scrutiny; and the Department of Justice's secret subpoenaing of private phone records of several Associated Press reporters and editors in the wake of a terrorist plot leak. Even if Obama escapes further significant problems, he will not be able to avoid the ""lame-duck"" factor. That is, as a president cannot seek more than two terms, political focus will refocus elsewhere, particularly after the November 2014 congressional ballots when the 2016 presidential election campaign kicks into gear. Taken overall, Iranian diplomatic progress and wider recent events in the Middle East are therefore likely to accentuate the incentives for Obama to place increasing emphasis on foreign policy -- which Congress has less latitude over -- in his remaining period of office. And, this shift is only likely to be reinforced if, as anticipated, the U.S. economic recovery continues to build up steam in 2014. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Hammond.","Obama administration seeking Iran deal as part of wider Mideast strategy, says Andrew Hammon .

"(CNN) -- When NASCAR team owner Jack Roush crashed his plane at an Oshkosh, Wisconsin, airport Tuesday night, the aircraft ""cartwheeled"" an undetermined number of times and ended up facing the opposite direction, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Peter Knudson said Wednesday. Knudson said upon landing, the Beechcraft Premier jet, registered to Roush Fenway Racing LLC, rolled ""hard to the right,"" then its right wing dropped ""way down"" and struck a grass strip, and the plane flipped over at least once. The jet ended up facing north, though it had flown in facing south, Knudson said. The NASCAR owner was piloting the plane, which took off from Detroit, Michigan, Knudson said. The NTSB is leading the investigation into the accident. The Experimental Aircraft Association said in a statement Tuesday night that Roush's passenger in the plane was Brenda Strickland of Plymouth, Michigan. Video showed the two of them walking away from the plane, which appeared to be split toward its midsection. The morning after the incident, Roush remained in serious, but stable, condition at Theda Clark Medical Center in nearby Neenah, Wisconsin, hospital spokeswoman Megan Wilcox said Wednesday. She said it was ""too early"" to say how long Roush would remain in the hospital. The facility was keeping details about Roush's injuries private ""at the request of his family and racing team,"" Wilcox said. However, Roush's racing team released a statement quoting attending physician Dr. Kevin Wasco as saying that Roush's injuries are not life threatening. Strickland was brought to Oshkosh's Mercy Medical Center, where she was listed in good condition, Mercy spokeswoman Maria Heim said Wednesday. The Experimental Aircraft Association's annual air show, AirVenture 2010, had just ended for the day at Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh when the crash happened at 6:15 p.m., association spokesman Dick Knapinski said. The accident shut down the airport until its regular 8 p.m. closing time, but the airport re-opened Wednesday morning, according to Knapinski. He said Roush comes every year and ""does presentations as an airplane enthusiast."" Knapinski said Roush owns one of ""probably fewer than 200 airworthy"" World War II-era P-51 Mustang fighter planes and Roush had been scheduled to give a presentation about his vintage prop plane Tuesday. Roush had also been slated to appear at the air show Wednesday, signing autographs and talking to NASCAR fans at the Ford tent. ""Roush Fenway Racing is NASCAR's largest team operating eight motorsports teams. Four in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series with drivers Matt Kenseth, Greg Biffle, Carl Edwards and David Ragan; and four in the Nationwide Series with Edwards, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Colin Braun, Brian Ickler, and Paul Menard,"" said the statement from Roush's racing team.","NEW:The NTSB says NASCAR team owner Jack Roush's plane rolled hard to the right and cartwheeled upon landing .

The number of injuries and extent of damage were not immediately clear. [Breaking news update at 1:56 a.m. ET] . (CNN) -- Two people missing from a trailer park in central Oklahoma have been found, Pottawatomie County Sheriff Mike Booth said. The two residents were not there when a tornado devastated Steelman Estates, destroying homes. [Earlier story, updated at 11:25 p.m. ET] . Four-state tornado outbreak kills 1 . (CNN) -- At least one person was killed and around a dozen injured Sunday when a string of tornadoes tore through four states, ripping roofs off homes, downing power lines and tossing trees like matchsticks. The death happened at a trailer park in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, said Sheriff Mike Booth. He had no details, other than that the deceased was an adult male. Rescue crews were picking through the mangled metal remains of mobile homes as darkness fell Sunday. As many as 26 tornadoes were reported in Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois and Iowa, according to the National Weather Service, with Oklahoma and Kansas being the hardest hit. Some of those reports might have been of the same tornado. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency for 16 counties. One tornado touched down near Wellston, Oklahoma, taking out power lines and damaging several homes, according to video from CNN affiliate KFOR. The affiliate's helicopter pilot estimated the funnel cloud to be about a half-mile wide. ""It's tearing up everything,"" the pilot said. ""Just ripping everything up in its sight."" Aerial video from KFOR and CNN affiliate KOCO showed severe damage near Wellston and near Carney, Oklahoma. Roofs were ripped from homes, branches stripped from trees and roads were filled with debris. Tornadoes were also reported east of Dale, west of Paden, and near Prague in Oklahoma. Part of Interstate 40 in Shawnee, Oklahoma, was shut down in both directions Sunday night after a tornado touched down there, overturning multiple tractor-trailers. Eleven patients were being treated at St. Anthony Shawnee Hospital in Shawnee, Oklahoma, said spokeswoman Carla Tollett. Ten were not critical and will be released, while one remains in critical condition, she said. Still more tornadoes were spotted in Iowa, near Earlham, Huxley and east of Dallas Center, according to the weather service. It did not mince words, telling people to take cover there, as elsewhere. ""You could be killed if not underground or in a tornado shelter. Complete destruction of neighborhoods, businesses and vehicles will occur. Flying debris will be deadly to people and animals,"" it said in a Kansas advisory. The twisters are part of a severe weather outbreak that is sweeping through the region as storms move east. Baseball-sized hail, wind gusts and tornadoes are threatening to pummel parts of the central Plains and Midwest through Monday. ""We still have a couple of active cells, and so we don't know for sure that it's over yet,"" said Jerry Lojka with the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. Beyond the Midwest, other areas saw severe weather on Sunday. In Atlanta, serious flooding was reported amid storms producing heavy rainfall. Here's a quick look at CNN meteorologist Melissa Le Fevre's forecast for Monday for hard-hit Midwestern states: . Kansas . The surface front may stall on Monday, leading to showers and thunderstorms through the day. Localized heavy rainfall may lead to the need for flood watches and warnings. Oklahoma . There is a threat for strong storms in the late afternoon. With the heavy rain that will occur through the weekend, flooding could become a problem Monday night. Iowa . Showers and storms are expected to develop on Monday afternoon. Large hail is possible and though the tornado threat looks low, it cannot be ruled out. Missouri . Flooding is expected to become an issue after localized heavy rainfall. Afternoon storms could produce large hail, damaging wind gusts and possible tornadoes. In St. Louis, storms will reorganize during the afternoon and evening hours. Threats include large hail, damaging winds and the possibility of tornadoes.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of activists camped out at the foot of a Bahraini landmark early Wednesday after the Persian Gulf state's king pledged to consider reforms and investigate the killings of two demonstrators during protests this week. Police were nowhere in sight as about 3,000 people laid out blankets and pitched tents in Manama's Pearl Roundabout, where a massive pearl sits at the apex of a circle of inward-sweeping arches. Police gave the area a wide berth, apparently allowing protesters to vent their anger before Wednesday's funeral for one of the dead, said Mansoor Al-Jamri, editor of the newspaper Al Wasat. ""It's a very relaxed atmosphere,"" Al-Jamri told CNN. ""You'd assume it was a picnic area if you didn't know it was the aftermath of people who died."" Demonstrators painted anti-government slogans on the bases of the monument, sang, told jokes and led chants into the early morning hours, he said. Bahrain is the latest Arab state to face a surge of dissent following the revolts that toppled longtime autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt. The Gulf island's ruler, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, went on television Tuesday to announce that a committee would be established to study proposed reforms. ""We will ask the legislative authority to look at this phenomena and to suggest the necessary legislation which will solve this in a way that will benefit the homeland and its citizens,"" he said. And he vowed that his government would investigate the killings of two protesters by security forces. Hamad called the two deaths unfortunate and offered his condolences to their families, adding, ""May God give them patience and forbearance. ""The kingdom of Bahrain is a country of law and constitutional institutions,"" he said. ""We have a law that organizes peaceful demonstrations that was decreed by an elected committee. The right to express one's opinion is a right that is given by the constitution and has been organized by the law which we must all follow."" The first of the two dead, Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, was killed Monday while protesting for human rights in the village of Daih, near Manama, said Nabeel Rajab, president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. The second, 31-year-old Fadhel Matrook, was one of thousands who attended Mushaima's funeral procession Tuesday. Human rights groups say Matrook was shot by security forces using pellet guns. Maryam Al-Khawaja, from the center, told the international human rights group Amnesty International that police attacked the funeral procession with pellets and tear gas within minutes of its onset. Activists have decried the use of pellet guns at short range by Bahrain's security forces. Amnesty International called the deaths ""tragic"" and ""a very worrying development."" Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's director for the Middle East and North Africa, said authorities must make clear that the ""use of excessive force will not be tolerated."" In a recent report, the group said Bahraini authorities detained 23 opposition political activists in August and September and held them without contact for two weeks, ""during which some allege they were tortured."" Bahrain's Interior Ministry said on its website that an investigation has been ordered to find out the reason behind the incident. The kingdom's main opposition party, al Wifaq, has suspended its participation in parliament because of the security forces' action. Bahrain is an American ally and houses the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. In Washington, the State Department said it was ""very concerned"" by the violence and said it welcomed the promise of an investigation. ""We urge that it follow through on these statements as quickly as possible,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said in a statement issued late Tuesday. ""We also call on all parties to exercise restraint and refrain from violence."" Bahrain is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family, but two-thirds of the population are Shiites. In recent years, younger Shiites have staged violent protests to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, and many Shiites say the country's constitution has done little to improve their condition. The protest movement in Bahrain has been organized using social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter, in the same manner as the protests in Tunisia and Egypt.

"(CNN) -- As he strained, crunched and lifted weights, the muscle panels surfaced from Jason Dinant's stomach. Faintly at first, they emerged: one, two, three and four -- not yet a six-pack. ""In the first three months, I saw such a fast improvement, now I'm worried about plateauing,"" said Jason Dinant. ""My bottom two abs haven't come in yet,"" he said. Since January, Dinant, an iReporter, has tried to get  six-pack abs in time for his 10-year high school reunion in June. Dinant, a Las Vegas, Nevada, resident, is one of the three iReport contributors being followed by CNNhealth as they strive to meet diet and fitness goals they set at the beginning of the year. iReport.com: See the journey to change . Dinant wanted to whip his beanpole figure into muscular shape. He also wanted to display a healthier physique for his blog called ""Naked Boy News,"" where he stands shirtless to give what he calls ""the naked truth about today's news."" And now the 27-year-old has another motivation. Dinant will be a guest, riding in a chariot-style car for an ""ab-veil"" on June 28 for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride March in New York.  His car is to be accompanied by rows of shirtless men who also have six-packs. Dinant was invited because,  the Naked Boy News is ""a very popular act,"" said Maurice Michaane, director of the event. ""People in the Northeast know him."" With the parade only two months away, Dinant said: ""Now I'm in high drive. There's no cheating on the diet."" To get in shape, he works out four to five days a week, performing a combination of core exercises, dumbbell curls and pull-ups. He jogs, does cardio exercises and works with a fitness trainer.  To avoid looking like ""a toothpick with abs,"" he started lifting weights. With a stringent diet and hours at the gym, the 6-foot-tall Dinant shrank from 160 to 143 pounds. Losing weight is normal with all the exercising and dieting, said Robert Dothard, a personal trainer based in Atlanta, Georgia. ""You can't see a six-pack through fat,"" Dinant said. ""Belly fat is the enemy. People reveal their ab muscles, but the nutrition and exercise are also formula for weight loss."" The key is to eat in increments, but it's difficult for people with traditional, 9-to-5 jobs to eat something every two hours to maintain their weight, he said. Body builders try to offset the weight loss by consuming protein powders and supplements, Dothard said. Dinant's weight loss was completely unintentional. He said eating 16 egg whites and 1¼ pounds of chicken breasts every day gets old after three straight months. ""It's hard to eat that much protein,"" Dinant said.  ""I started drinking this protein shake so I can get in all the calories and protein."" Compared with just four months ago, the ""man boobies"" and the extra layer of flab around his midsection have been lost, Dinant said. And there's an even bigger benefit. ""I'm awake more. I'm alert more and I have more energy,"" he said.  ""I just feel better. My whole body has become healthier and better."" While pleased with the results, Dinant worried that with two-thirds of a six-pack, his body will begin to plateau. ""Plateaus are really a mental thing,"" Dothard said.  ""When that happens, people start going back to their own habits. So they end up cheating and binging."" If the body doesn't respond to the workout anymore, more difficult exercises should be adopted. ""Jason has to do something different or harder to maintain results to keep on the track that he's on,"" Dothard said. ""It can be frustrating, especially when he is still working out and the body is not responding to the same thing. People work out 30-45 days and get tremendous results, then it slows down or stops. Nothing's wrong. The body is adjusting to what you're doing.""","Jason Dinant, an iReporter, has met two-thirds of his goal for six-pack abs .

"(CNN) -- Selecting a winner for the Nobel Peace Prize is an invidious task because there are so many worthy recipients. There are individuals who put their lives on the line to help others and defuse conflicts as well as organizations which work on a daily basis, and invariably below the radar of media attention, to push a peace agenda. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),which is this year's recipient of the peace prize, is in the latter category. I am thrilled that Ahmet Uzumcu, the Director-General of the OPCW has been awarded the Nobel on behalf of his organization. For years the OPCW has been working to persuade governments to sign up to a treaty outlawing chemical weapons. Known as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC ), this treaty which established the OPCW, is the fruit of millions of hours of diplomatic negotiations in the 1980s and early 1990s. Building on earlier treaties, the CWC is one of the most comprehensive international agreements to control armaments. It requires signatories to agree that they will never manufacture or use chemical weapons, nor will they support others in this endeavor. Syria is the latest country, and the 190th, to sign up, somewhat unwillingly, to the treaty. Most countries have acceded to the CWC willingly because they recognized the devastation which chemical weapons will cause. In World War some 1.5 million were injured or killed by chemical weapons. More recently in the 1980s the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq used chemical weapons, including mustard gas and various nerve agents, against Iranian soldiers and Kurdish civilians -- tens of thousands were injured and killed in Iraq and Iran as a result. Some 30,000 Iranian soldiers are still receiving treatment today for chemical weapons related injuries. But undoubtedly, the most shocking incident was the attack by the Iraqis on the Kurdish city of Halabja where some 5,000 were killed and more than that number injured. Families sheltering in cellars to get away from bombs where asphyxiated by nerve gases, chemicals which are heavier than air and which sink to fill any depression in the landscape. Images on our television screens from Syria over the last few months are a reprise of what happened in Kurdistan. Families in Ghouta, on the outskirts of Damascus, and resident in areas controlled by forces opposed to the Syrian government regime, were asleep in their beds when rockets filled with nerve agents fell through bedrooms or landed in the street. Some rockets appear to have discharged their cargo before impact, others on hitting the ground. Videos show glimpse into evidence for Syria intervention . The result was predictable. Thousands were affected, many dying without even waking, with others succumbing painfully over the hours that followed as they gasped for breath. How many died? We do not know for certain. But numbers are being collated in Syria by doctors, activists and lawyers and the tally seems to be well over 1,000 now. Many more were injured and some of these are highly likely to have long term effects, a situation which has to be investigated as a matter of urgency. We know all this from what doctors and others have told us and from the many images uploaded on YouTube. But we also know that it was the nerve gas sarin that caused all this trauma, just one of the many traumas Syrians have faced over the nearly three years of the conflict. We know it was sarin because the OPCW, on behalf of the Secretary General of the U.N., sent in inspectors to take samples of soil, scrapings from used rockets, and blood samples from people. These samples were tested for the presence of chemical weapons in four of the 22 laboratories which have the necessary expertise and which are part of the OPCW's network of competent organizations to help it enforce the CWC. The laboratories confirmed that sarin had been used. The OPCW now has the task of overseeing the destruction of the chemical weapons Syria has declared it has. The task is formidable because of the civil war in the country. Funding will also have to be found to pay for the work which is additional to the routine policing, fact checking and inspections which the OPCW does on a daily basis to ensure old chemical weapons are destroyed, no more are produced and that the chemical industry continues to make ploughshares rather than weapons of war. The chemical industry, worldwide, supports this activity. So Ahmet Uzumcu in post as Director-General of the OPCW for over two years now, inherited an organization which had a solid reputation for excellent work over the years. But he has done more than simply acknowledge his inheritance and has, and is, steering his band of some 450 employees (from many countries ) in a direction which will help guarantee that the attacks on Ghouta will become a thing of the past. We are all much safer because of the OPCW which has done its painstaking work largely unnoticed by the world. No longer! Well done OPCW. Your award is richly deserved. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alastair Hay.","For years the OPCW has been trying to persuade governments to outlaw chemical weapons, writes Alastair Hay .

"Birmingham, Alabama (CNN) -- A preliminary investigation has found no evidence of an ""uncontained engine failure"" or a ""pre-impact fire"" in the engine of a UPS cargo plane that crashed in Birmingham, Alabama, killing the pilot and co-pilot, a National Transportation Safety Board official said Thursday. There also was no indication of a problem with runway lights, Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB told reporters. The news came as authorities announced the cockpit voice and flight data recorders were recovered from the wreckage near Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, and were being sent to NTSB headquarters in Washington. ""We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to collect good, usable data,"" Sumwalt said. The recorders were blackened and coated with soot from the fire that engulfed the plane on impact. But they are made to withstand crashes and heat, Sumwalt said. Investigators had to use picks and shovels to retrieve the data recorders from the wreckage because flames in the plane's tail section kept officials from accessing them immediately. The devices could help investigators determine why the plane -- which did not issue a distress call -- went down early Wednesday while on approach to the airport. UPS identified the pilots as Capt. Cerea Beal Jr., 58, of Matthews, North Carolina, and First Officer Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee. Beal had been with UPS since 1990 and previously had served six years in the U.S. Marine Corps as a heavy lift helicopter pilot, according to a statement released by UPS. Fanning had worked for UPS since 2006, the statement said. The Airbus A300-600F broke into pieces as it crashed around 4:45 a.m. in an open field near a street that runs parallel to the airport. The cargo plane had 12 ""service difficulty"" reports on file at the Federal Aviation Administration, including at least two that the reports indicated led pilots to declare emergencies. But an aviation expert told CNN he believes none of the previous problems would have played a role in the accident. The reports document problems ranging from an inoperative light in an emergency exit light assembly to a problem with the plane's flaps. ""I don't see anything there that indicates in any way that its related to the events in Birmingham,"" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member and former certified aircraft mechanic. The flap problem, reported in 2006 while the plane was flying in Germany, might raise concern had it not occurred so long ago, he said. Witnesses said the plane, which took off from Louisville, Kentucky, flew low over a neighborhood, striking the tops of trees and knocking down power lines as it crashed. The crash site is about a half mile north of a runway. Five facts to calm plane crash fears . A photo showing the jet engine blades only partially damaged could indicate that the engines were not running or were at ""very low idle"" upon impact, instead of the faster ""flight idle"" typical upon landing, Goglia said. ""An engine that is producing power, those (blades) would have been gone,"" said Goglia. The lack of damage suggests that ""they weren't spinning so fast and they stopped quickly."" If the data recorders contain information, investigators should be able to quickly discover the status of the engines before impact. But if the data is not retrievable, investigators will focus on the condition of the blades, Goglia predicted. Airbus said Wednesday the plane had approximately 11,000 flight hours in some 6,800 flights. It was powered by Pratt & Whitney engines. The plane was one of two flights UPS sends to Birmingham each day, company spokesman Mike Mangeot told CNN affiliate WBRC. The crew did not report any trouble, Birmingham Mayor William Bell said, citing conversations with control tower officials. Light showers and a visibility of 10 miles were reported in the area of the airport at the time of the crash, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. CNN's Michael Pearson Jason Hanna, Marlena Baldacci, Aaron Cooper, Mike Ahlers and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report .","NEW: UPS identifies the pilots as Capt.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A commercial airplane carrying 127 people crashed Friday in Islamabad just before it was to land at a nearby airport, according to Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, which cited poor weather as a possible factor. No survivors have been found, officials said. The Bhoja Air Boeing 737-200 had been making its first evening flight from Karachi to Islamabad, where the weather was cloudy, officials said. Authorities twice changed the number people reported to be on board, but by Friday afternoon appeared to agree on the figure. The crash occurred near the Chaklala airbase, a military site used by the country's air force, which is adjacent to the Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad. Debris and body parts were scattered across the crash site as workers sifted through the wreckage in the heavily populated residential area. Four villages were affected by the crash and debris from the plane has been recovered within a kilometer of the site, Interior Minister A Rehman Malik said in a interview with Pakistani media. At least 110 bodies have been recovered from the scene, while more than a 150 bags filled with body parts have been transported to hospitals across the region, according to Farkhand Iqbal, a municipal official in Islamabad. World's deadliest plane crashes . The flight data recorder, which is considered a key component in determining what may have caused the tragedy, was recovered, officials said. The Bhoja airliner had been flying from the southern seaport city of Karachi and crashed just before touching down in the capital after its 3Â½-hour flight. Local authorities say the crash site is located about five aeronautical miles from the airport in Islamabad. Weather reports indicated that conditions in the area included thunderstorms and limited visibility, according to CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos. Authorities are examining what may have caused the crash and the potential for additional casualties at the site of the wreckage. Investigators are ""going to be looking at technology,"" aviation security consultant Greg Feith said. ""What kind of radio equipment, what kind of ground proximity warning system the aircraft was equipped with, weather radar, things like that ... since the weather may be a factor in this accident."" Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Friday expressed ""deep shock and grief over the tragedy,"" ordering his country's Civil Aviation Authority ""to gear up all its resources for rescue operation,"" state media reported. A separate inquiry into the incident has been launched by Pakistan's Safety Investigation Board, and two crisis operation rooms have been set up at airports in both Islamabad and Karachi to provide information to the affected families. A Boeing spokeswoman, meanwhile, said the American manufacturer ""stands ready to provide technical assistance to the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan."" The airliner was originally sold in 1985, said Julie O'Donnell. ""The Boeing Company wishes to extend its profound condolences to the families and friends of those lost today in the Bhoja Air accident in Pakistan, as well as wishes for the recovery of those injured,"" said O'Donnell. Responding to allegations that the aircraft was not in good condition to fly, Defense Secretary Nargis Sethi told a local television station that the government has initiated ""an immediate investigation."" ""Whether it was 10, 8 years old, or not airworthy is something that we can't confirm yet,"" Sethi said. But Bhoja Air station manager Zahid Bangish told a Pakistani television station later Friday that the ""aircraft was new, not the old one and unairworthy."" The crash is reminiscent of one in 2010,when 152 people were killed as a Pakistani passenger plane crashed on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. That plane was also was coming from Karachi when it crashed into a hillside while trying to land, officials said at the time. Four years earlier, another airliner crashed in central Pakistan, leaving 45 dead. The first known commercial passenger airplane crash occurred in Pakistan in 1953 when a Canadian Pacific DH-106 Comet crashed shortly after takeoff from Karachi. That crash killed 11 people on board.

"(CNN) -- It's the stuff of urban legend that NASA in the 1960s spent hundreds of thousands developing a ballpoint pen that could operate in zero gravity while the cash-strapped Soviet space program resorted to a cheaper and more elegant solution -- the pencil. As with most urban legends, the truth is slightly more complicated - NASA was justifiably nervous about allowing astronauts crumbly and combustible objects such as pencils after the fatal Apollo 1 fire in 1967 -- but it illustrates the important role culture plays in developing space missions. China -- the latest player on the deep space block -- is no exception. At Hong Kong's Polytechnic University, Professor Yung Kai-leung, the associate head of the department of industrial and systems engineering, has designed high-precision space tools mimicking chopsticks and Chinese ceramic soup spoons. With space programs and technology often shrouded in secrecy, it's not surprising that Professor Yung has had to find unique solutions to the technical problems of operating in an environment as hostile as the moon. Timeline: China's race into space . ""Our technology is different,"" Professor Yung told CNN. ""There's nothing in our engineering where we can make use of another's design."" He said that the complexity of space missions is such that each one is like a fingerprint -- no two are the same -- and the engineering must respond to a unique set of problems. ""When you are talking about a space mission, you have to consider all the eventual possibilities, so all our designs have a number of alternatives -- if one part doesn't work then another part can replace it."" For the European Space Agency's Mars Express Mission he designed the Mars Rock Corer which drills the sample and then, by simply reversing the mechanism, picks up the core like a pair of chopsticks. His digger based on a Chinese soup spoon has the heat-resistant qualities of ceramics and the ability to operate in a deep hole in much the same way that a Chinese soup spoon operates better in a rice bowl than a flat metal Western spoon. He's currently working on a camera pointing system that will track the descent and operation of the working robot on the Chinese moon mission aboard Chang'e 3. As with all equipment on moon missions, it must meet a stringent series of tests. Not only must it be able to operate in extreme temperatures and in a vacuum, it must offer the greatest strength and versatility for the least payload and have the ability to fix problems if something goes wrong. With the moon 380,000 kilometers away, Yung says there's little margin for error. ""It's such a long way away,"" says Yung, laughing. ""If you look at the NASA missions they often put down two landers at the same time, just to minimize the risk. ""Quality control is very stringent in the Chinese missions -- I think that this has been the problem that has plagued the Russian missions recently. ""Millions of things can go wrong and one small thing can affect the whole mission. On the Russian missions it was the integrated circuits -- there are thousands of electronic components on a space mission. You only need one of them to go wrong to go off course."" Super secret base fuels China's space ambitions . In the 1960s, more than one-third of the missions failed, he said. While the odds have improved since then -- and the Chinese have the luxury of learning from the mistakes of the space pioneers at NASA and the Russian programs -- he said launch time is always especially tense for the designers and engineers in Hong Kong. ""Say with communications, for instance, it's very simple -- if the antenna is not pointing towards earth you won't get a signal,"" he said. ""You have to take into consideration factors you couldn't possibly imagine."" Yung's team even have to gauge the minute amount of vapor released by the metals used in the instruments to make sure that, not only do the gases not contaminate the moon samples, they don't mask the work of other delicate instruments on the mission. Essential to this work is what he calls ""space qualifications""; the experience that allows you to anticipate various problems and overcome them. His space qualifications have led him to develop unique precision instruments such as a grinder that not only pulverizes samples of space rock, but sieves them too -- all in zero gravity and all in a vacuum. ""This was a difficult problem to resolve -- normally you need gravity to sieve anything,"" he said, explaining that the machine packed the sample into a puck before forcing it through the sieve. While luck sometimes plays a role amid the nail-biting uncertainties involved in a space mission, Yung admits that money often maximizes the luck needed for a lunar landing. China's estimated space budget is around US$2bn a year -- not even a tenth of the budget that NASA receives. Given these restraints, he says the Chinese program has a very exacting space culture but is in no hurry, preferring to chase quality rather than simply notch up runs on the board. ""The Chinese want to see very clear results,"" he said, adding that, having worked with the Russian and European space programs, China's space program offered an interesting point of comparison. ""I've collaborated with the Europeans, with the Russians and with the Chinese and all of them have different cultures,"" Yung said. ""The Europeans discuss things for a long time and there are a lot of changes because there are different nations involved and they have different ideas and it slows things down even to the point of not taking off at all. ""The Russians think they have a lot of experience but a lot of this experience is now dated. I think they have to realize that,"" he said. ""The Americans have too many vested interests with commerce in space exploration."" As for the moon, he said there was still much work to be done in examining samples, in particular the remote possibility that deposits of helium-3 -- believed to be in greater concentration on the moon -- could one day power nuclear fusion power plants on earth. Chinese scientists are also anxiously awaiting their very own fresh samples of moon rock. ""I think from all the NASA missions to the moon, China has just one gram of moon dust to study,"" he told CNN.","Hong Kong's Professor Yung Kai-leung designs high-precision space tools .

"(CNN) -- Lady Gaga announced that she's going to sing in space. Everyone is raving about ""Gravity,"" the new movie starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts in orbit. And India just launched its first Mars mission on Thursday. Clearly, we Earthlings are still madly in love with space. But what about the moon? It's sad how far America has fallen in our space aspirations. So far that we can't even get into Earth orbit without help from the Russians, let alone get back to the moon. But NASA is trying to get back in the game. Two months after launch, its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer -- LADEE, pronounced ""laddie"" -- has finished its looping journey and it is gathering important information about the moon's dust and thin atmosphere. Already, this modular spacecraft has tested a new system for interplanetary communication using pulsed lasers, delivering a blistering 622 megabits per second. Try getting that from your Internet service provider. LADEE is a worthy mission, but it's a far cry from the romance and ambition of space exploration 50 years ago. When Frank Sinatra released a swing version of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" in 1964, the song captured the optimism of the U.S. space program. President John Kennedy had challenged the country to a manned moon landing three years earlier and NASA's budget rose by a factor of five to accomplish the goal. The moon landings were a phenomenal achievement. Even knowing that they were motivated by a rivalry with the Soviets and fueled by an unsustainable budget didn't tarnish their luster. The Saturn V was the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, and the Apollo program was the most technically complex human undertaking in history. Two dozen brave and daring astronauts reached their target with computer processors less powerful than those inside our modern-day smartphones. The 12 who loped across the lunar soil are the only people to set foot on another world. Today, the Apollo moon shots fade and flicker in the public consciousness, like the grainy black-and-white TV images that many of us recall from just over 44 years ago. About 6% of the American public thought the moon landings were a hoax, despite high resolution images that show the landers and tracks left by the rovers, and ongoing scientific experiments using the hardware we left behind. I used to get annoyed at the Apollo deniers. (Buzz Aldrin at least managed to get even; YouTube videos where he decks conspiracy theorist and filmmaker Bart Sibrel have been watched more than half a million times). Then I realized that a list of things that one in 10 Americans believes would include some pretty outrageous things. But willful cultural ignorance is sad. New players are stepping into the vacuum. Google announced the Lunar X Prize in 2007, riffing off the successful Ansari XPRIZE, where private teams were challenged to build a reusable spacecraft to reach the boundary of outer space. A $20 million prize will go to the first team to land a robot on the moon that can travel 500 meters and transmit images and video. Twenty teams are still in the running. The competition expires when all the prizes have been claimed or at the end of 2015, whichever comes first. China is likely to beat all these teams to the punch. A few weeks ago the Chinese announced that the Chang'e 3 lunar rover will be launched by the end of the year. If successful, it would be the first soft landing on the moon since the Russian Luna 24 in 1976. Less than a decade old, China's space program is well-funded and aggressive. China has put 15 astronauts in orbit and plans to complete a 60-ton space station by 2020. Following Chang'e 3, they plan sample return by 2020 and a manned landing by 2025. So, more than half a century after Eugene Cernan left the last human footprint on the moon, the next may be made by someone who speaks Mandarin. Meanwhile, other countries are getting into the act. The European Space Agency has long-term plans to send robots and astronauts to the moon. Japan and India also have advanced plans for lunar rovers. The United States led the world in space but NASA is cooling its heels, with a vision that has shrunk along with its budget. America's space program would be best served by continuing the mission started 50 years ago. The moon still has much to teach us about how the solar system and the Earth formed. It's not the sterile place we once thought; there's enough water and oxygen in the soil to easily sustain a base. It's the perfect place for learning how to live and work beyond the Earth. When Sinatra performed ""Fly Me to the Moon"" on his TV show in 1969 he dedicated it to the Apollo astronauts ""who made the impossible possible."" LADEE was designed to characterize the lunar environment in preparation for future human missions. But the Constellation Program that would have gotten us back to the Moon was canceled in 2010. LADEE will set the table but no one's coming to dinner. By partnering with other countries or private sector companies, NASA can rekindle the dream and fulfill our destiny to explore beyond our planet. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Impey.","Chris Impey: It's sad how far America has fallen in our moon aspirations .

"New York (CNN) -- Organizers of New York City's Halloween parade have rallied public support and raised enough money to put on the annual event after facing financial woes stemming from losses caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Members of the non-profit organization that puts on the parade each year started an online fundraising campaign using Kickstarter.com with the goal of raising $50,000 by Monday. In total, organizers raised $56,030 from over 900 donors -- more than enough to host the hundreds of puppets, more than 50 bands, and thousands of dancers, artists and costumed New Yorkers who will take part, according to organizers. The parade was canceled for the first time in its 39-year history in 2012 after Superstorm Sandy ""Frankenstormed"" the event . After the fundraising success the parade has been officially revived, just in time for the 40-year anniversary, organizers said on the parade's official website. The financial losses from 2012's last-minute cancellation posed a ""huge obstacle"" to putting on this year's parade, they said. ""We fronted money for the parade that we never got the chance to make back,"" the organizers said in their online campaign. ""We lost a lot of money ... . We really went down,"" Matthew Fass, musical director of the parade, said in an online video, adding that without donations from the public, the parade would have been canceled again. Online organizers say that the parade will provide a much-needed economic boost to the area's local businesses, which was hard-hit by the storm. Often referred to as the Village Halloween Parade, the annual festivities have taken place on Halloween every year since 1973 and include more than 60,000 participants. Two million spectators line a mile-long stretch of 6th Avenue to watch, the online campaign boasted.","Superstorm Sandy forced cancellation of parade in 2012, causing financial losses .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will meet Friday with Thein Sein, the president of Myanmar who has overseen a series of political reforms in the Southeast Asian country over the past year, a senior State Department official said. Clinton is in Cambodia to attend a regional conference after visiting a string of Asian countries in the past few days. She will meet Thein Sein in Siem Reap, a fast-growing Cambodian tourism hub next to the spectacular temples of Angkor. The announcement comes after President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the United States was easing sanctions on Myanmar, allowing American companies to do business there -- a move that prompted concern from human rights advocates. The U.S. government considers the meeting with Clinton a reward for Myanmar's progress in undertaking reforms, the State Department official said. In the past year, authorities in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, have released hundreds of political prisoners and allowed the party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to participate in by-elections. They have also engaged in peace talks with ethnic rebel groups. For decades, Myanmar was ruled by a repressive military junta. But in recent years, the generals have relaxed their grip on power, permitting Thein Sein's government to enact changes. Western government have responded to the reforms by easing sanctions. Obama praised Thein Sein, Suu Kyi and the nation for ""significant progress along the path to democracy."" The loosening of sanctions, he said, ""is a strong signal of our support for reform, and will provide immediate incentives for reformers and significant benefits to the people of Burma."" However, Obama noted that the United States ""remains deeply concerned about the lack of transparency in Burma's investment environment and the military's role in the economy."" As a result, the licenses that will allow U.S. businesses to invest in Myanmar will not cover entities owned by the Myanmar armed forces and Ministry of Defense. The U.S. Treasury will also have the authority to impose sanctions on ""those who undermine the reform process, engage in human rights abuses, contribute to ethnic conflict, or participate in military trade with North Korea,"" Obama said. But despite those safeguards, the Obama administration is allowing U.S. companies to do business with Myanmar's strategic oil and gas industry, which has been a key source of income for the regime, said Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia. ""We're disappointed that the U.S. government has included the oil and gas sector in Burma in the easing of the sanctions,"" said Robertson, who is based in Bangkok, Thailand. He drew particular attention to Myanmar Oil & Gas Enterprise, a state-owned company singled out by Suu Kyi as lacking in transparency. Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, said Thursday that it hoped U.S. companies would invest responsibly in Myanmar in light of these concerns. ""There is no true transparency in the country,"" said Nyan Win, a spokesman for the NLD. ""How can we be sure that investment will be beneficial to our people?"" The signs of both reform and resistance to it were evident in Myanmar this week. Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who endured years of house arrest under the junta, was sitting in parliament for her first legislative session since she was sworn in two months ago. At the same time, military leaders nominated Myint Swe, a former general who is considered fiercely loyal to the former dictator Than Shwe, to be the country's next vice president. His likely promotion from chief minister of the region of Yangon to the second highest post in the country has disappointed observers who hoped for a more reform-friendly candidate. These conflicting signals will provide the backdrop to Clinton's meeting with Thein Sein on Friday. Robertson said he hoped the secretary of state will raise the ""long list"" of outstanding human rights issues in Myanmar during the meeting, including the hundreds of political prisoners who remain behind bars and ongoing conflicts concerning ethnic minorities. ""The government says they will resolve these issues but they haven't done it,"" he said. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","NEW: Opposition party says there is ""no true transparency"" in Myanmar .

"(CNN) -- More romaine lettuce has been recalled amid an investigation into an outbreak of food-borne illness that has sickened at least 19 people in three states. Vaughan Foods of Moore, Oklahoma, is recalling romaine lettuce with ""use by"" dates of May 9 and May 10, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement. The company sold the lettuce to restaurants and food-service facilities, the administration said. Vaughan said in a statement Tuesday that it had informed customers who purchased the suspect lettuce. ""Food safety continues to be Vaughan Foods' number one priority,"" said Mark Vaughan, president and CEO of the company. ""Vaughan management is not aware of any links to any food-borne illness associated with any product produced by Vaughan Foods."" Vaughan's recall comes after Freshway Foods recalled romaine lettuce last week because of a possible connection to an outbreak of food-borne disease linked to E. coli O145 in Michigan, Ohio and New York. Blog: What you should know about E. coli . A sickened Ohio State University student sued Freshway on Tuesday. Freshman Richard Cardinale filed a lawsuit after his stool sample tested positive for E. coli O145, according to court documents. He suffered from gastrointestinal problems including bloody diarrhea and dehydration and was hospitalized on April 14 for treatment. ""We have a new form of deadly E.coli to contend with,"" said food safety lawyer Bill Marler, who is representing Cardinale. ""It is past time for the government and industry to track this bug as it does E.coli O 157:H7,"" he said, referring to the best known form of toxic E.coli. Authorities are investigating a farm near Yuma, Arizona, where the tainted lettuce was harvested, the Food and Drug Administration said. Vaughan Foods received lettuce from that farm, the administration said. FDA: Link between bagged romaine lettuce and E. coli O145 illness outbreak . Investigators have confirmed that the outbreak has sickened 19 people: 10 in Michigan, seven in Ohio and two in New York. Twelve of the 19 have been hospitalized, including three who developed a potentially life-threatening complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, the administration said. In addition, health investigators cite the outbreak as the ""probable"" reason that 10 other people have fallen ill: five in New York, three in Michigan and two in Ohio, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though most healthy adults recover from E. coli O145 within a week, young children and the elderly are most at risk of developing HUS. Federal health authorities are encouraging anyone with such symptoms to contact a health care provider immediately. Ohio-based Freshway Foods said that the recalled shredded romaine lettuce was sold to wholesalers, food service outlets, and some in-store salad bars and delis.

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the lame-duck Senate on Wednesday to ratify the new Russian nuclear arms control treaty, warning that a failure to do so would undermine a critical need for ""stability, transparency and predictability."" Clinton, appearing on Capitol Hill to push for approval of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, said the administration intends ""to do everything we can during this lame-duck session to get a vote to ratify this treaty."" ""This is not an issue that can afford to be postponed,"" she said. Clinton was joined by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, the top Republican on the committee. All three noted that there have been no American ""boots on the ground"" inspecting the Russian nuclear arsenal since the expiration of the old treaty last December. Russia still has thousands of nuclear weapons, Lugar warned, and ""any one of those warheads could obliterate the city of Indianapolis,"" a reference to the capital of his home state. This is an ""existential problem for our country,"" he said. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen later said he is ""extremely concerned"" that nearly a year has passed since the expiration of the old treaty. ""The military leadership across the board in the United States ... supports moving forward with this treaty and I hope we can do that as rapidly as possible."" If approved, the new START treaty would restart mutual inspections while limiting the United States and Russia to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each. Top Democrats were stunned Tuesday when Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, the Republican point man for Senate deliberations over the treaty, said in a statement that he had told Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, that the accord should not be considered before January, when the newly elected Congress is seated. He said he didn't think the current Senate should ratify the treaty ""given the combination of other work Congress must do and the complex and unresolved issues related to START and modernization."" The White House learned about Kyl's opposition to taking up the vote during the lame-duck session ""via the press,"" according to a senior administration official. The White House, which has already committed $80 billion to nuclear modernization efforts, recently promised to spend $4 billion in an effort to win the support of Kyl and other conservatives. ""We're talking.  In good faith,"" Kyl told CNN on Wednesday as he walked into a Senate vote while escorted by Kerry. Alarmed Democrats have repeatedly warned it would be dangerous to further delay consideration of the treaty.  On Tuesday, Vice President Joe Biden called the pact, among other things, ""a fundamental part of our relationship with Russia, which has been critical to our ability to supply our troops in Afghanistan and to impose and enforce strong sanctions on the Iranian government."" The vice president said the administration will continue to seek Senate approval of the treaty before the end of the year.  A two-thirds Senate vote is required to approve the measure; the more conservative incoming Senate is believed to be less likely to ratify the accord. Seventy-three percent of Americans believe the Senate should ratify the treaty, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Tuesday.  Twenty-three percent are opposed to its approval. Russia has not approved the measure yet. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Jill Dougherty, and Laurie Ure contributed to this report .","NEW: Adm.

"(CNN) -- An Iranian actress has been sentenced to a year in jail and 90 lashes for appearing in a film critical of the country's government, an opposition website said. Actress Marzieh Vafamehr stars in the recently released ""My Tehran, For Sale,"" which challenges the limits imposed on artists in the Islamic republic, according to the website, Kaleme. ""As producers of the film ... we would like to express our deep shock and sadness at the sentence imposed by the Iranian government against actress Marzieh Vafamehr and we continue to offer our support to Marzieh and her family by respecting their wishes to let the case and the appeal follow the proper legal channels,"" said Kate Croser and Julie Ryan. The movie features Vafamehr playing an actress who is banned from working in Iran and then tries to leave, the Kaleme website said. The website did not offer specifics about what Vafamehr was convicted of or when she was sentenced. In August, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said it had interviewed the actress's husband, Iranian filmmaker Nasser Taghvai. ""It is a bitter tale why our artists should end up in prison for their profession; this is so painful. An actor cannot say I would do this in a film, or I wouldn't do that in a film. (If they did,) nobody would give them work anymore,"" the rights group quoted Taghvai as saying on its website. ""This film has a producer and a director.

"(CNN) -- An ongoing ""massive deployment"" against insurgent groups in northern Nigeria by the nation's special forces killed at least 14 suspected terrorists and captured 20 others, according to a statement released Sunday by Nigeria's defense ministry. The ministry had reported killing at least 10 suspected terrorists and apprehending another 65 on Saturday, as well as the deaths of ""conservatively speaking, over 20 dead"" on Friday. Sunday's update noted that three soldiers were killed and seven more were wounded in the offensive. Opinion: Nigerians ask, are we at war? Troops also seized seven vehicles and 13 telephone handsets, as patrols moved ""to secure towns and villages from infiltration,"" while enforcing curfews in areas deemed potentially dangerous, the ministry said Sunday. A day earlier, the ministry trumpeted a weapons seizure that included rocket-propelled grenade launchers.. Among those targeted by the military was the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. The military said its forces stopped an attempt by fleeing Boko Haram insurgents to infiltrate Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, in northeastern Nigeria. Much of the violence over recent years has been blamed on Boko Haram, the name of which means ""Western education is sacrilege."" On Friday, a spokesman for the U.N. human rights commissioner told reporters that Boko Haram could face war crimes charges for alleged ethnic and religious cleansing in Nigeria. Addressing reporters in Geneva, Rupert Colville urged it and other extremist groups to stop ""cowardly attacks"" against civilians, security forces, Nigerian officials and foreign nationals. According to Human Rights Watch, the group has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, with a population of nearly 175 million according to the CIA World Factbook, and is the political and economic powerhouse of West Africa.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The final European race of the 2009 Formula One season is being held at one of the world's most historic tracks. Monza hosted its first race in 1922 and has been the spiritual home of Italian motor sport and Ferrari ever since. The 1951 Italian Grand Prix was won by Alberto Ascari. Four years later he was killed at Monza. La Pista Magica, as the Italians like to call it, is set in the grounds of a former royal park, 12 miles north of Milan and has hosted many of Formula One's defining races and tragedies. Britain's Sir Stirling Moss, a three-time Formula One winner at Monza told CNN: ""It's a very good circuit. And being in Italy, it has a lot of atmosphere -- particularly if you're driving a red car. The Italian crowds are passionate about their racing."" It is the fastest track Formula One drivers visit all year with speed in the straights approaching 370 kph (230 mph). ""It's the only one left with such speed,"" Force India's new driver Tonio Liuzzi told CNN. ""Nowhere else in the championship can you reach top speeds."" Liuzzi, who has completed two Monza Grand Prix for Toro Rosso, says the first time you race at Monza can be daunting. ""You have really low downforce and you can get a bit scared if you think of the speed you are approaching the Ascari or the Parabolica."" The Parabolica is probably the best known turn at Monza. It comes at the end of the fastest straight on the track and starts the final loop round into the home straight.  View photos of Monza through the years » . The corner was the scene of one of the sport's biggest tragedies in 1961. German driver Wolfgang von Trips was killed when his Ferrari collided with the Lotus of Jim Clark. Von Trips' car flew off the track, spun into the crowd --protected by a chain link fence -- and killed 15 spectators. ""It was an awful day,"" Stirling Moss, who was competing in the race, said. ""He was a really charming guy. We used to lose three drivers a year, but he was quite a special person."" But it wasn't Monza's worst crash. In 1928, Italian Emilio Materassi died along with 27 spectators when his lost control of his car and plunged into the crowd. Von Trips' accident signaled the end of the road for the high speed oval and its vertiginous banking. It always led to a compromise in how the car was set up for a race says Moss. ""The handling on the banking was completely different,"" he said. The decommissioning of the high speed ring reduced the length of the track from 10 kilometers to 5.8. But it was never demolished and still sits among the undergrowth, gradually giving itself up to nature. The derelict oval has become part of the allure of Monza. ""It's an old school circuit,"" Liuzzi said. ""When you're racing there you sometimes look between the trees and see the old parabolicas and banking corners. You can feel the history at Monza and that's what makes it so special."" The technical challenges that Monza presents have never diminished the excitement or quality of the racing there -- not least Moss's first victory in 1956. Moss's Maserati developed a split in the fuel tank and with five laps to go he was running on empty. A desperate Moss signaled to fellow Maserati driver, Liugi Piotti that he needed a push. Piotti obliged by using the nose of his car to push Moss into the pits. A refueled Moss returned to the track and won the race. One of the greatest drives ever seen at Monza wasn't a win but a third place finish by Scotland's Jim Clark in 1967. Clark started on pole and was leading until a puncture forced him into the pits. He returned to the race over a lap behind in 16th place. Undaunted, Clark stormed through the field, recording one lap record after another eventually regaining first place. But with the checkered flag in his sights, Clark's car ran out of fuel and he had to settle for third. Four years later Monza witnessed one of the closest finishes in Formula One history with five cars being separated by 0.61 seconds. In a slipstreaming battle Peter Gethin beat Ronnie Peterson by 0.01 seconds. All the great Formula One world champions have won at Monza -- Schumacher five times, Fangio three, Prost three and Jackie Stewart and Ayrton Senna have both won there twice. For all the attraction of Formula One's growing band of new circuits, it's places like Monza that get motor sport enthusiasts pulses racing. It epitomizes all that Formula One once was and what it is still about today -- speed, passion, skill and most importantly courage.","Built in 1922 Monza is the oldest track on the Formula One calendar .

"(CNN) -- Beware the ""crazy ants."" Researchers at the University of Texas are warning that the invasive species from South America has the potential to change the ecological balance in the southeastern United States, largely because the ants can wipe out colonies of what's been widely considered the insect villain of the region, the fire ant. The crazy ants, officially called ""Tawny crazy ants,"" are omnivores that can take over an area by both killing what's there and starving out what they don't kill, said Ed LeBrun, a research associate with the Texas invasive species research program at the Brackenridge Field Laboratory in the College of Natural Sciences. ""Perhaps the biggest deal is the displacement of the fire ant, which is the 300-pound gorilla in Texas ecosystems these days,"" LeBrun said in a press release. ""The whole system has changed around fire ants. Things that can't tolerate fire ants are gone. Many that can have flourished. New things have come in. Now we are going to go through and whack the fire ants and put something in its place that has a very different biology. There are going to be a lot of changes that come from that."" Beyond the troubles they cause for the environment, the crazy ants can be a big headache for people because their populations are so dense, LeBrun said. The crazy ants nest in walls, crawl spaces, house plants or empty containers in the yard, researchers said. ""They don't sting like fire ants do, but aside from that they are much bigger pests,"" he said. ""There are videos on YouTube of people sweeping out dustpans full of these ants from their bathroom. You have to call pest control operators every three or four months just to keep the infestation under control. It's very expensive."" The crazy ants are going so crazy, in fact, that some people want their fire ants back, LeBrun said. ""Fire ants are in many ways very polite. They live in your yard. They form mounds and stay there, and they only interact with you if you step on their mound,"" he said. U.N.: Eat insects, save the world . Scientists are unsure how far the ants, which are native to Argentina and Brazil, may spread in the U.S. Since being first seen in Houston in 2002, they've been found mostly in wetter environments with mild winters in parts of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. And while they can quickly overwhelm a small area, the reproductive members of the species don't fly, so to move over large distances, they have to hitchhike -- in your stuff. ""If people living in or visiting invaded areas are careful and check for the crazy ants when moving or going on longer trips, they could have a huge impact on the spread,"" LeBrun said.

"(CNN) -- In football-obsessed Kenya, like much of Africa, the beautiful game is more than just a sport -- it's an inescapable way of life for millions of young people, a sacred carnival that's staged passionately everywhere from grandiose stadiums to gravel fields and dusty patches of land. But for the laborers inside this brightly lit workshop on the outskirts of Nairobi, football is also serious business. Surrounded by Arsenal and Liverpool team posters on either side of the walls, the blue-shirted workers meticulously cut and stitch pieces of leather. Eyes straight down, they put the final touches on the white and yellow footballs they're crafting on their wooden work stations. This is the Kenya-based hub of Alive & Kicking, the only formal manufacturer of sports balls in Africa. The social enterprise, which has two more plants in Zambia and Ghana, uses the widespread popularity of football in the continent to help create jobs and offer disadvantaged children access to sport equipment. ""In Africa, the passion for football is absolutely immense,"" says Sughra Hussain, chief executive of Alive & Kicking, which was launched in 2004 by late Briton Jim Coogan. ""But according to our calculations, a third of children have actually never played with a real football before,"" she adds, explaining the principles on which the group was founded. ""At the same time, there are very high levels of unemployment, with a high proportion of the population living below the poverty rate."" Durable balls . All across Africa, millions of football-loving children are unable to afford quality balls to play with. Instead, they often rely on whatever's at hand to create their own makeshift versions, using anything from strings and plastic bags to strips of cloth and inflated condoms. These improvised balls, however, often won't last long. Lopsided and fragile, they regularly fall victim to the thorn bushes dotting the weedy fields and pebbly yards the game is usually played on. Read this: Cameroon's outspoken football star . To deal with this, Alive & Kicking uses locally sourced leather to produce durable balls that are suited to local conditions. ""Our balls are made from genuine leather, so they last longer on the rough terrains of the compounds and slums in which they are often used,"" says Hussain. Health awareness . Over the last nine years, Alive & Kicking has produced more than 500,000 balls, including volleyballs and netballs. About half of them are sold in the major supermarkets of the countries the group works in, at a cost of around $18, while the rest are either bought by local NGOs or corporate organizations. But Alive & Kicking, which employs 130 people in three countries, is not only interested in the retail side of the business. More than just a company, the group has donated a fifth of the balls it's produced --- more than 100,000 -- to schools and children's projects in rural areas as part of its efforts to raise health awareness. Read this: Flying doctor saving lives . Each donated ball is printed with simple directives such as ""Play Safe"" and ""Sleep Under A Net"" to convey health messages about the dangers of HIV/AIDS and malaria. Famous backers . For its efforts, the group has over the years attracted the interest of several high-profile athletes and officials, including English Premier League football stars and world dignitaries like the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki Moon. Even Barack Obama was presented with one of the group's balls during a visit to Kenya in 2006. England international footballer Micah Richards, who's been named an ambassador for Alive & Kicking, says: ""It's a fantastic way to create jobs for those that need them in Kenya, Zambia and Ghana, and provide equipment for people that can't afford to buy it.""","Alive & Kicking is a social enterprise that manufactures balls in Africa .

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa mastered wet track conditions at Le Mans to win the French MotoGP Sunday -- the second straight win for the Spaniard in motorcycling's premier class. Pedrosa has also hit the front in the title race, taking over from compatriot and Repsol Honda teammate Marc Marquez, who battled to the final podium spot after a slow start. Britain's emerging young star Cal Crutchlow was sandwiched between the two Spaniards, his second place his first podium at this level and a major boost for the Monster Yamaha Tech3 team. The 28-lap race started in treacherous conditions with a number of leading contenders, Italian Valentino Rossi included, coming to grief. He eventually finished back in 12th. Rossi's factory Yamaha teammate and reigning world champion Jorge Lorenzo also struggled to adapt to conditions and wound up a well-beaten seventh to trail Pedrosa by 17 points in third in the title battle. Pedrosa, who started sixth on the grid, also took his time to pick his way to the front with Ducati's Andrea Dovisiozo a long-time leader before slipping back to fourth place. Pedrosa, who leads Marquez by six points after four rounds, has finished second, followed by two straight wins since his fourth in the opening round at Qatar. But he acknowledged that in drying conditions he had to be at this best to take the checkered flag. ""When I was in front I made a couple of mistakes and almost ran out twice. I was on the limit,"" he told BBC Sport. The 27-year-old Crutchlow, the first genuine contender from his country for a number of years, held off the charging Marquez to hold on to second, despite riding with a small fracture to his shin sustained in a practice crash. ""It's nice to finally get that podium,"" he said. He is up to fourth in the overall standings, leapfrogging Rossi. In a further boost for British motorcycling, Scott Redding secured his first win in the Moto2 class.","Dani Pedrosa wins rain-hit French MotoGP at Le Mans .

"(CNN) -- North Korea said Wednesday that the U.S. citizen it sentenced last month to 15 years of hard labor has begun his stay at a ""special prison."" Kenneth Bae, who the North Koreans refer to as Pae Jun Ho, was arrested in November in Rason city, a port in the northeastern corner of North Korea. Opinion: When Americans are held in global power games . North Korea accuses him of seeking to bring down the regime of Kim Jong Un, but the United States and his family say he was just working as a tour operator. In a short article Wednesday, the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Bae had ""started his life at a 'special prison' on Tuesday."" It didn't give any details about the prison. The United States has repeatedly called on North Korea to grant Bae amnesty and release him immediately, but the requests so far don't appear to have gained any traction following a period of heightened tensions between the two countries. Even a plea last week for Bae's release from the basketball star Dennis Rodman, who met with Kim Jong Un during a bizarre visit to North Korea in February, has failed to have any apparent effect. North Korea outlines accusations against Bae . Accused of 'hostile acts' Last week, KCNA cited a spokesman for the North Korean Supreme Court as saying that Bae, a Korean-American tour operator, set up anti-North Korean bases in China and distributed anti-regime literature. ""He committed such hostile acts as egging citizens of the DPRK overseas and foreigners on to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign against it,"" the court said, using the shortened version of the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He was accused of preaching at churches and lecturing to groups about the need to escalate confrontation, the court said. NK News, a U.S.-based website that focuses on North Korea, has suggested Bae has served as a missionary trying to convert North Koreans. Opinion: What North Korea could learn from Myanmar . ""I knew that Jesus wanted me to be a 'channel' to the North,"" Bae told a Korean congregation at a St. Louis church in 2011, NK News reported last week. ""This year, I'm working at taking several short term missionary teams into North Korea."" Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said earlier this month that her brother ""never had any evil intentions against North Korea."" She said Bae was in the country for work related to the tour company he owns. He had traveled to the country previously with no problems and had no reason to suspect that this time would be different, Chung told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Not a 'bargaining chip' In the past, North Korea has released Americans in its custody after visits by a U.S. dignitary -- in recent examples, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. But North Korea said earlier this month that Bae is not a ""political bargaining chip."" His case ""proves that as long as the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK remains unchanged, humanitarian generosity will be of no use in ending Americans' illegal acts."" Read more: How a voice from a North Korean gulag affected human rights discourse . Tensions between Pyongyang and Washington spiked in March and April amid a flurry of fiery North Korean threats against the United States and South Korea. The angry rhetoric appeared to be fueled by tougher U.N. sanctions against the North after its underground nuclear test in February, as well as by annual military drills in the region by the United States and South Korea. The intensity of the North's rhetoric appears to have subsided in recent weeks, and the U.S.-South Korean drills finished at the end of April. North Korea is considered to have one of the most repressive penal systems in the world. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent.","A court sentenced Kenneth Bae to 15 years of hard labor last month .

"(CNN) -- Mayors Julian Castro of San Antonio, Michael Hancock of Denver, Kevin Johnson of Sacramento, California, and Angel Taveras of Providence, Rhode Island, each attended public schools in the cities they now lead. This month, they launched a tour to meet educators, families and innovators in each of their cities, with the hope of understanding their shared problems -- and potential for solutions. ""Education is more than a quality of life issue. Education impacts everything that we do in the city. It really is a fundamental right and it's a path out of poverty,"" Taveras said. ""We're working to see what's going on in each other's city and to share solutions and help adapt them to our own city."" They hope to take home lessons learned in each city in order to address gaps between wealthier areas with great schools and poorer neighborhoods where schools struggle. The tour will continue through March. ""We have an achievement gap between children of color and white kids that quite frankly, if we don't address and begin to address effectively with some sense of urgency, will threaten the real vitality and freedoms of this country,"" Hancock said. Here are lessons the four mayors learned by working with their cities' schools -- and through their own experiences as students. Not all A's are created equal . Before he was mayor of Sacramento, Kevin Johnson had gotten a basketball scholarship to Berkeley and thought he was a good student, he said. But during his freshman year at University of California Berkeley, Johnson realized that getting A's and B's in high school didn't mean he was prepared for college. ""I was in an English class with 30 kids and they were all talking about a word -- the word was 'euphemism' -- and 29 of those kids knew what the word meant,"" Johnson said. ""I was the only kid who did not know the word 'euphemism' and I remember thinking, 'Am I in the wrong class?'"" Johnson realized then that an A in one school might not equal to an A in another, and even students with good grades can be in for a rude awakening when they go to college. (After graduating from Berkeley, Johnson went on to play twelve seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Phoenix Suns.) ""Far too often a child's educational outcomes are determined by her or his ZIP code, and that's the case in Sacramento, too, and this has led to an unacceptable achievement gap,"" Johnson said, describing how slow they've been to close the gap between white and black students' scores. ""It's horrifying."" Denver Mayor Michael Hancock described a similar experience. ""I got into college, as well as many of my peers, and we realized we were not where we needed to be, we were behind some of our peers,"" he said. ""So we had to do special classes and programming to get caught up and really put in the extra effort."" He struggled with writing and math early in college, he said, which makes him consider what hard-to-spot problems might exist in Denver's schools. ""That's where we begin to see some of the cracks and some of the gaps that may not be as apparent in the primary system,"" said Hancock, who is an advocate of school choice. ""Families should be able to pursue the best possible educational opportunity that is available to them, no matter where that opportunity exists in the city,"" Teachers can change lives . San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro was just a few years into his school career when he began to understand the power of a good teacher. ""In the first or second grade, I had a teacher who gave me extra homework to do and she explained that she had confidence that I could do the extra work and that made me feel great about myself,"" Castro said. ""I got to excel in school and that was the beginning of my feeling good about achieving academically."" Providence Mayor Angel Taveras said he became a lawyer because his third-grade teacher, Mrs. Dorothy Donaldson, told him he could. ""She was someone who asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up and I told her that I wanted to be a lawyer. She asked me 'Why?' and I told her that I wanted to help people. She made me repeat it to anyone and everyone who would listen,"" Taveras said. The same teacher suggested Taveras test for a gifted program, which allowed him to take more intense math classes, and eventually led him to a more challenging school. It's never too early to start learning . Taveras, himself a graduate of the early childhood education program Head Start, said he has worked to improve early childhood literacy in his city by introducing programs such as Providence Talks. The program aims to close the ""word gap."" Research shows low-income children hear millions fewer words in the early years of their lives than their peers in middle- or upper-income homes. The program provides low-income children with recording devices that count the words they're exposed to each, and coaching parents and caregivers on how to improve their children's vocabularies. The devices work in several languages, including English and Spanish, and is expected to launch in 2014. Providence Talks was the winner of the $5 million Bloomberg Philanthropy Mayors Challenge, a contest created by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to draw out ideas from city leaders. Castro described how San Antonio residents had recently voted to fund full-day pre-kindergarten for more than 22,000 of the city's 4-year-olds over the next eight years. Castro said he hopes it will prevent students from falling behind, experiencing the frustration of falling behind and perhaps dropping out. Children's educations can begin even before they're enrolled in school, he said. ""One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that students are prepared when they start school,"" Castro said. ""We have so many young people who are not read to and they're not prepared when they start pre-k.""","Four American mayors are touring each other's city to learn more education solutions .

"Makhachkala, Dagestan (CNN) -- At least four people are dead and 44 are injured after two bombs exploded Monday in Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, the Ministry of Health's website says. Thirty-one of the injured were hospitalized, it says. The incident -- which occurred in Makhachkala, capital of the semi-autonomous republic of Dagestan -- also caused significant damage. Security officials say they believe law enforcement officers may have been the target because the explosion occurred outside a local marshal's building. One car bomb was discovered by a police patrol, who called in a unit to defuse it. Before that could be done, the bomb went off, but the explosion was minor, security officials said. Then, as a crowd of people gathered, a second, more powerful device detonated, causing the casualties. An Islamic insurgency has taken hold in the North Caucasus and there is a strong presence of Islamic militants fighting Moscow's rule. READ MORE: Dagestan violence kills at least 5 . Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- the suspects in the Boston Marathon terror attack last month -- had ties with the region. The brothers are ethnic Chechens who lived in Kyrgyzstan and Dagestan. Authorities who've been investigating how the brothers became radicalized are interested in a trip Tamerlan Tsarnaev took to Dagestan last year. Russian authorities asked U.S. officials to investigate Tsarnaev before the trip, saying they believed he was becoming increasingly involved with radical Islam. The FBI investigated, but found no evidence of extremist activity, FBI Director Robert Mueller told a Senate committee. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is in custody. His older brother died after a shootout with police just outside Boston days after the bombing. READ MORE: Keys to Boston attack could lie half a world away in restive region of Russia .

All three are described as Russian citizens trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan, he said. Security forces conducted their operation in the Orekhovo-Zuevo region of the Moscow suburbs. ""They were planning a terror attack in Moscow,"" the spokesman said. No civilians were injured during the operation, but one Federal Security Service officer was wounded, state news agency Ria Novosti reported, citing an unnamed security source.

"(CNN) -- It's time for some tiger cubs to approvingly roar for our strict parents, their domineering ways and their inflexibly high standards. The current depiction of tiger parenting is decidedly negative. Kim Wong Keltner's book on ""Tiger Babies Strike Back"" and Su Yeong Kim's report ""Does Tiger Parenting Exist? Parenting Profiles of Chinese Americans and Adolescent Developmental Outcomes"" suggest that strict Asian-style parenting produces an army of disengaged or emotionally stunted robots. While I can't speak for everyone, my own experience suggests that such upbringing also gives us the smarts to recognize our emotional and social deficiencies and to address them. My parents are immigrants from Taiwan. I was an only child, and I was expected to excel academically and extracurricularly. So, I delivered. I got straight A's. I played violin for hours. I did extra math, chemistry and physics problem sets under the eagle-eyed gaze of my mother. Through it all, I cried and screamed. A lot. My mom yelled back. A lot. I told her I hated my life, my teachers, my school and all my activities. She yelled that I just had to get through it. Quitting was not an option. And of course she was right. Opinion: Tiger moms, don't turn your kids into robots . I owe everything I am and have accomplished to my parents. My family expected a lot from me only because they believed in me and wanted the best for me. They pushed me to excel because they valued me as an individual. Tiger parents express their love through expectation of greatness, not in acceptance of mediocrity. Some people interpret such expectation as parental rejection of their worth as individuals. I always interpreted such crushing expectation as the ultimate belief in my self-worth. I knew that I was not being set up to fail. My mother did not push me to excel because she prized my accomplishments more than my feelings. She listened to my feelings, but she also knew that my teenage feelings were volatile and irrational. She knew better than to let my future be derailed by such feelings. My mother also knows that life has many obstacles, some external, many internal. She loved me too much to let me give up easily when confronted with those obstacles. For that I am eternally grateful. I gained confidence and resilience from tackling my endless workload and from fighting through sleep deprivation. I knew that I was capable of getting through seemingly impossible situations. I knew that if I failed, then I just had to try harder. Failure is not a permanent state, but merely a temporary challenge that had to be tackled creatively. The knock against tiger parenting style is that it does not foster emotional and social development. Well, it partly comes down to expressing love and affection differently. Tiger parents may not often say ""I love you,"" but actions speak louder than words. My family never would have spent the time, money and effortâ€”not to mention the emotional energyâ€”on me if they did not love me. They never said this, of course. But I knew. Sure, my mother viewed socializing with others as a waste of time. She wanted me to be valedictorian, not homecoming queen. I didn't attend my homecoming. I was probably studying or working on my science project. Now, I readily acknowledge that there is great value in socializing with others, and that my current social skills probably would be better if I had more time to hang out at the mall or at Denny's. But childhood hours are limited. Each child only has about 157,680 hours before he/she turns 18. The opportunity cost of being an accomplished child is that it takes away time from making friends and nurturing relationships. For me, the tradeoff was worth it. There are skills that can only be learned in childhood. It is hard for a student to catch up academically if she is significantly behind in high school. But someone can become more self-aware, work on social skills and learn negotiating tactics later in life. Without the skills and expertise that is a result of excelling, I would never have the chance to sit at the important tables to participate in the discussions, no matter how great my social skills. I value my tiger cub upbringing mostly for the tools it gives me to make a difference in my community. I know plenty of grown up tiger cubs who tutor at-risk youth, advocate for the disadvantaged, and generally strive to improve the world. Our childhood accomplishments enable us to meaningfully contribute to our communities. And isn't that where self-awareness and proper socialization lead us all?

"(CNN) -- America has endured the exhaustion of a decade of war and the insult of a battered economy. Now many Americans reject all foreign entanglements as expensive, fruitless and, ultimately, futile. In a recent Pew Research poll, 80% of those answering agreed with the statement, ""We should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems and building up our strength and prosperity here at home."" For the first time since Pew began asking the question in 1964, more than half said they believed ""the U.S. should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own."" In the past that figure has topped out around 40%. Yet even as Americans work to draw the blinds along the nation's borders, the country celebrates the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela, a leader who looked relentlessly outward. ""Our human compassion binds us the one to the other,"" Mandela is quoted as saying, ""not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learned how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future."" And right now that common suffering is found in abundance in Syria. In 2Â½ years the conflict has gone from local uprising to sprawling and brutal civil war. The U.S. announced Wednesday it was suspending even nonlethal aid to fighters in northern Syria opposed to the Assad regime as moderates among them lose ground to forces aligned with al-Qaeda. An estimated 125,000 Syrians have died in the conflict -- the equivalent of killing the population of Cambridge, Massachusetts, or Burbank, California. The war has made refugees of 2 million Syrians. More than a million of these refugees are children, and three-quarters of them are under the age of 12. Polio has returned to attack Syrians, most of whom haven't even reached their second birthday. Cities are said to face starvation, with families said to be turning to eating dogs and anything else that might keep them alive. Winter is nearing and humanitarian agencies are hurrying to ready supplies for the millions of refugees, many of whom fled with only the barest of belongings. As of September, 100,000 Syrian children in Jordan were not in school and the United Nations predicts double that number in Lebanon before year's ends. Water and working toilets are scarce. News: Syrian refugees face miserable winter in Lebanon . The human suffering, in short, is great. But today we are fast-forwarding through these sad stories, keeping our eyes shut and our wallets closed. The charity Mercy Corps raised more funds for the victims of the typhoon in the Philippines in three days than it has in almost three years for the war in Syria. But few have taken to the streets or to Capitol Hill to say that the United States should do more. In fact, the feeling seems to be that the U.S. is doing quite enough. Already the country is the largest humanitarian donor to Syria. President Barack Obama ran into resistance at even the prospect of armed intervention when he tried to push for ""limited"" military action earlier this year -- an effort that ended with a deal to collect Syria's chemical weapons. But he made no progress in creating a humanitarian corridor or imposing a ceasefire to help ease the suffering of those trapped amid falling rockets and flying bullets. Juxtapose this against this past week, when the world has lauded a leader who showed through his actions and his words that human compassion and a shared humanity sat at the very center of the human experience. Mandela pushed us to care about others, to see ourselves in others, especially when circumstances conspired to rob them of their homes, their livelihoods and their dignity. Indeed, as Obama said at Tuesday's memorial service, ""Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa -- Ubuntu -- a word that captures Mandela's greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us."" Certainly helping is complicated, but standing by as more children die and humanitarian catastrophe sweeps the country is a comfortless option. America is tired, but avoiding the world is not a strategy, it is a preference. It will not leave America safer or stronger. Diplomatic energy dedicated to opening a humanitarian corridor is critical. Former Ambassador Thomas Pickering is among many diplomats who have advanced the idea that America can do more. If the United States can devote days of urgent and focused diplomacy to getting Syria's chemical weapons in safer hands, surely we can try harder -- in concert with key players and powers -- to do the same for Syria's children. And Americans, for their part, can give to organizations that help parents get blankets and water. And helping teenagers to deal with the traumas they have witnessed can ease some of their suffering. The world celebrates the life of a stoic hero who dared to stand up to injustice -- a man who would not live quietly beneath the easy shade of comfort, but who acted when he saw others suffer as oppression flourished. But we must heed his words as well -- a call to engage with the world, to ensure that those most vulnerable are not invisible, ignored. ""What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived,"" Mandela said. ""It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gayle Tzemach Lemmon.","Gayle Lemmon: Poll shows Americans are weary of foreign entanglements .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams underlined their status as overwhelming favorites for the French Open by breezing through their respective title matches in Rome Sunday. Nadal crushed long-time rival Roger Federer 6-1 6-3 in a one-sided final at the Foro Italico. Earlier, Williams blasted 41 winners as she beat Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka by the same score. It was her 24th straight win and she is 16-0 on clay this season with three tournament wins. Nadal was playing his eighth straight final since returning from a seven-month injury layoff in February and has been on an upward curve with each successive week. The pair were meeting for the 30th time and the 20th in a final, but Nadal dominated from the start, breaking service three times. The second set was closer but the 26-year-old Spaniard was never seriously tested as sealed his 24th Masters crown and sixth title of the season. ""If you'd told me that four or five months ago I would have said you are crazy,"" fifth-seeded Nadal told AFP after his win. He now leads Federer 20-10 in head to head clashes with 13 of those wins coming on his favored clay surface. It was Nadal's seventh title triumph in the Italian capital but for Swiss ace Federer it was a sobering experience. ""Rafa has much more topspin than all the guys I played this week, so the change was quite a big one,"" he said. ""I tried to play offensively, but unfortunately I didn't have the best day. It didn't go the way I was hoping it to go."" Williams, who lost to Azarenka at the Doha tournament this year, never looked in serious danger of a repeat as she swept through the opener for the loss of a single game. She had a brief moment of concern in the second when her Belarus opponent broke back to trail 3-4, but then lost her own service in the next game. No.1 Williams served out the match to love with back to back aces to complete victory in one hour 33 minutes. She then proved a winner with the crowd by giving her victory speech in Italian. For No.3 Azarenka, there is the consolation of a solid week after two months out with an ankle problem. We had a lot of tight games and the match was closer than the score, but Serena played a very good match and was better in the important moments,"" Azarenka told the WTA Tour official website. ""After the trophy ceremony we were just talking about the match and wishing each other luck for the French Open, and that we'll see each other in Paris and hopefully see each other in another final.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is in India on his first foreign trip since assuming the post and has begun diplomatic talks at a delicate time for the world's two most populous nations. Just weeks ago, the world witnessed the latest chapter in one of Asia's least understood disputes when soldiers from China's People's Liberation Army crossed the border and set up an encampment in the mountains at the edge of the Indian region of Ladakh. The troops have since withdrawn, but the incident served as a stark reminder of the smoldering problem that still bedevils the Asian behemoths. The origins of the struggle for this charged corner of the world lies in the realpolitik and imperialism of the 19th and 20th centuries. According to a report by the U.S. Marine Corps Command and Staff College, the British, installed in their Indian colony, attempted to demarcate their holdings with the ""Johnson Line."" CNN iReport: Indians protest China's incursion . Drawn by the surveyor, William Johnson in 1864, it claimed the area known as Aksai Chin as part of India's Ladakh territory. The British later repudiated the line and, in 1899, replaced it with the Macartney-MacDonald line. The new line moved Aksai Chin back to China. After World War I, the British reversed themselves again, placing Aksai Chin back in India, but never made any effort to exert formal authority. In 1947, newly independent India drew their border to reflect the more generous Johnson Line even though they had not exerted an iota of control over Aksai Chin for almost half a century. The Ladakh incursion puts a wrinkle on what seemed to be a burgeoning era of Sino-Indian bonhomie. In recent years, both nations have bent over backwards to demonstrate their mutual good will. Bilateral trade is expected to hit $100 billion by 2015, joint military exercises were held last year (after previously being suspended) and both sides had agreed to respect a more favorable boundary for China known as the ""Line of Actual Control."" But China's recent advance beyond the de facto border is hardly without precedent. According to The Times of India, China has violated the LAC more than 500 times since 2010. Though experts have described many of these transgressions as ""routine,"" and regular military contact exists between the two governments, any ""mistake"" that were to occur by the Chinese army on Indian soil could be volatile. Particularly in China, journalist-stoked jingoism can turn even the most banal activity into an absurd ballet of face-saving. Far-fetched? In 2002, American soldiers in South Korea accidentally ran over and killed two 14-year-old girls. The Yangju Highway Incident, as it became known, sparked a fury of anti-American protests and severely tested the U.S.-Korea relationship -- and America was there legally. How would India and China resolve a similar incident? ""Mistakes can be made,"" said Anil Gupta, professor of strategy & globalization, at the University of Maryland at College Park and co-founder of the China-India Institute. ""However, I do not believe that either China or India is looking for a fight."" Gupta stressed that China's latest incursion should be seen in a regional context as a test of ""muscle-flexing"" and that its actions were not indicative of any real desire to acquire new territory. Muscle-flexing or not, what is certain is that in recent years China has become a very bad neighbor. Their Indian claims extend over a 6,530-kilometer (4,057-mile) border, which includes a sizeable chunk of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and large swaths of Bhutan. In the last year the world saw the strident revival of China's long dormant claim to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, as well as a string of others extending as far south as the James Shoal, a mere 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the Malaysian coast. While the risk of conflict between China and India will always remain until a final resolution is reached, going forward, there are reasons to believe that the two sides will be able to continue on a relatively peaceful track. China's relationship with India is far more benign than its one with their other regional antagonist, Japan. The 1962 Sino-Indian war, fought for this very territory, is all but forgotten among Chinese citizens, while memories of Japanese hostilities during World War II are as raw as ever. As the Sinologist Susan Shirk reported in her book: ""China: Fragile Superpower,"" China's relationship with Japan is highly sensitive and thus subject to the counterproductive impulses of popular nationalism. By contrast, China's relations with India stir no such emotions and are handled out of the spotlight with greater room to maneuver. Economics too will likely promote cooler heads. As Gupta noted, India's importance to China will only increase as India's economy grows. As a market for exports and investments, he predicted that India would become an invaluable partner. ""I see the next five years as high risk,"" said Gupta. ""Then I think we can all be a lot more relaxed."" Unfortunately, it remains a truism that facts on the ground often move faster than governments' ability to respond to them. In the absence of a resolution, the world can only hope that India and China succeed in kicking their differences down the road indefinitely, because if their dispute ever does come to a head, the consequences could be catastrophic.

"(CNN) -- Images of Super Typhoon Haiyan's aftermath in the Philippines appear so devastatingly apocalyptic that most Filipino-Americans remain on edge. What news does get out only makes the situation seem more unbearable, especially when CNN viewers see typhoon survivors such as Magina Fernandez make anguished pleas in televised reports. ""Get international help to come here now, not tomorrow, now,"" Fernandez said. ""This is really, really like bad, worse than hell. Worse than hell."" If only loved ones could hear a more reassuring message. But personal communication is slow in coming. Relatives in the United States and around the world are turning to social media sites such as Facebook, reading Philippine-based media sites (such as Manila's major newspaper, the Inquirer) for news, all while waiting for that phone call, text or any kind of message from an unaccounted loved one. Because of infrastructure failures, only a few individuals from the most ravaged areas such as Tacloban in the Leyte area of the central Philippines are able to communicate by cell or land line. iReport: Are you searching for a family member in the Philippines? While the Third World is in rubble, the First World is in the dark. Nearly half of all the 3.4 million Filipino-Americans live in California. Among them is Janet Alvarado, who waits for news from her home in San Francisco. Alvarado, 52, executive director of a historical project that preserves images of Filipino-American life and connects Filipino-Americans to Tacloban's main region, Leyte, has heard from just one family member. But that's just a single strand of a large extended family in the Philippines. Alvarado was born in the United States, but her mother, Norberta Magallanes Alvarado, 94, immigrated to the U.S. in the 1940s from Tacloban. Like many Filipinos, Norberta Alvarado came with only one of her younger brothers, meaning there are many relatives still living in Tacloban and the surrounding area. ""My mom is so worried,"" Janet Alvarado said. ""She just gets up every day and prays."" The first positive sign came when another cousin in San Francisco was able to confirm on Facebook and through text messages that her cousin Ruseli and husband Nonoy Gula were both able to leave Tacloban safely this weekend. ""She said they just couldn't stay,"" Janet Alvarado said. ""It smelled too much like death."" Another set of cousins, Dino Magallanes and a younger relative, were OK, too. Alvarado said they were on a motorcycle on the road from Biliran to Ormoc, another part of Leyte. Alvarado said that trip usually takes an hour, but it took five hours in the aftermath of the storm. ""They said there were just too many bodies all around,"" Janet Alvarado said about her cousin's experience. ""The bodies were just piled up on the road."" Now the focus is on finding another cousin from Tacloban proper. But no one has heard from him. ""Armando is an engineer in his late 50s,"" Janet Alvarado said. ""His daughter Inday is missing, too. Where they are? We just don't know. We haven't heard."" The Philippines Red Cross has reportedly set up a call service at 09175328500. The Philippine Daily Inquirer also reported that Google has set up a person finder at 16508003977, where one enters ""search (the person's name)"" into Google. iReport: Home 'wiped out,' but family is alive . But with news images looking increasingly grim, and another storm coming, hope is girded by more prayer. That's tough when even Leyte's Metropolitan Cathedral had its roof and ceiling blown away by the super typhoon, which is known as Yolanda in the Philippines. The government is well aware of the country's vulnerability to natural disasters. Sure enough, Yolanda, the third major typhoon to hit the Philippines in three years, comes at a huge financial cost. The Philippines has about $500 million to take care of infrastructure issues. The personal needs of the population will have to be made up from individual Filipinos throughout the world. The country's 10 million overseas workers already provide the Philippines with $24 billion in remittances. It's much needed when about a third of the people in the Philippines live in poverty, existing on $2 a day. The U.S. government has already committed $20 million to help the Philippines. Filipino-Americans will also be counted on to pitch in, perhaps even more than they already do. The struggling country boasted a first-quarter gross domestic product growth of around 7.8%, outpacing China as well as India, Thailand and Vietnam. President Benigno Aquino, with an aggressive pro-business and clean government platform, seemed to be getting the country back on its feet. But now this. iReport: 'All I could do was say a prayer' Filipinos have always been a tough people. But the typhoon has brought despair. We need everyone who can to help the survivors and country get back on track. In the meantime, loved ones anxiously hope that messages from relatives will come soon.

"(CNN) -- The corpse of another man's mother always looks like firewood from afar, so says an African proverb. Until recently, terrorism, war and the accompanying human carnage in far-away countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and many other troubled countries meant just more news of the crazy world out there. Not because of my lack of empathy, but distance can be a ready-made palliative for pain. Now, that distant and macabre dance of death that once seemed so far away on TV has come upon my country, Nigeria, with a big bang. Suicide bombing, towns and villages getting blown up, allegations of extra-judicial killings by the police and the military, kidnappings, terrorist attacks on government establishments -- total confusion and a lack of solutions to the violence is no longer just news, but a terrifying daily reality show. In the current wave of violence, especially in the northern and middle belt of the country, which has culminated in President Goodluck Jonathan declaring a state of emergency in the three states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, one is at a loss as to where the country is headed in its near future. Nigerian forces tout 'massive deployment' against insurgents . What has happened in Borno, a state in the northern part of Nigeria, in the past weeks is like full-scale war. A local official said recent attacks there, in the border town of Baga, left more than 185 inhabitants dead in unclear circumstances involving the military Joint Task Force (JTF), the peace-keeping government outfit that has been effectively inefficient in all the troubled zones. The army, however, said no more than 36 people were killed. The burning embers of the Baga massacre had hardly cooled off when another attack was carried out in Bama, another town in the same state. According to the army, 55 people were killed by Boko Haram; casualties including women and children were burnt alive. Watch this: Who are Boko Haram? Following these deaths came yet another wanton killing of policemen and soldiers in another state. The dead, as usual, are a mixture of innocent civilians, military personnel, policemen and members of Boko Haram, the Islamic militant group that has been carrying out attacks since 2009. The total break down of law and order and daily carnage made the governor of Borno, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, put the blame squarely on the doorsteps of his fellow politicians and the Nigerian government as the primary cause of the country's state of insecurity. According to the governor, ""Underneath the mayhem of Boko Haram lies the underlying cause which is extreme poverty and destitution ... until we address some of these issues the future is very bleak for all of us as the current crisis is just an appetizer of things to come. Very soon the youth of this country will be chasing us away."" Read more: 'Massive' numbers of Nigerian troops target insurgents . The governor also gave his view of the current mindset of Nigeria's political ruling class: ""The most important thing in Nigeria is about the last election and the next election, the only thing that is agitating our minds is how we can perpetuate ourselves in power. How much we can steal, how many mansions we can buy in Florida, Dubai and London, this is what agitates the minds of the elites of this country."" To hear this kind of finger-pointing and chilling words from one of those the rest of the country expects to resolve the conflict and bloodletting is quite enervating. A previously proposed panacea to the madness was the proffering of amnesty to Boko Haram members by the federal government, which it has so far refused. The whole amnesty idea to many observers bordered on the line of insanity and inanity. Two things -- the amnesty program that was first introduced to curb violence and pacify militants in the Niger Delta by the late President Umaru Yar'Adua and continued by Jonathan, cannot be said to be successful, as insurgency is still very much a clear and present danger in the Niger Delta. Secondly, it looks like crime pays in Nigeria when criminals and murderers are getting rewarded in the name of ""amnesty"" every time they put a gun or bomb to the government and people's temples. Wealthy Nigerians and multinational expatriates have become prisoners in a supposedly free country, constantly moving with heavily armed guards. For most, this has not proven effective as some of their armed guards have been outgunned by terrorists and criminals who mean business. Politicians are sometimes the worse off, and one cannot help but reason that the poverty planted by the rich and the ruling class over decades of misrule has yielded thorns in the flesh of our country. Despite the declared state of emergency (which has received a mixed reception), people are losing hope faster than a nailed tire. The insecurity is spreading to other parts of the country. Lagos is now taking on a new look of security consciousness. Many churches in the city have fully armed policemen holding AK47s guarding entrances during Sunday services. And it is no longer odd to walk into a cafe or restaurant and find armed policemen guarding diners, with guns resting among cutlery. The government seems to have keeled over and resorted to a full-blown military offensive, both land and air, against Boko Haram and its allies. It is too early to determine if this latest solution will abate the madness but it is horrifying for people to live with this kind of killing and uncertainty every day. When we now appear in foreign news segments we are right there with Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq ... places that are in full blown war and used to seem so far away. And the question trembling in most people's lips now is -- are we also at war in Nigeria? 'Are you in Nigeria? Have you been affected by the violence? Do you think the country is at war and, if so, how can it be stopped? Add your thoughts in the comments below.

"(CNN) -- With tears streaming down his face, David Beckham said farewell in his final home game as a professional footballer Saturday. Made captain for the night by Paris Saint-Germain coach Carlo Ancelotti, he played his full part in a 3-1 win for the new French champions over Brest. But on 82 minutes, with the realization that his glittering 847-game career was winding down, the raw emotion of the moment got the better of the most iconic player of his generation. Given a standing ovation by the near 45,000 strong capacity crowd in the Parc des Princes, Beckham hugged teammates and opponents before being substituted by Ezequiel Lavezzi. Family and friends, including his pop star wife Victoria, were in the stands to watch him as was former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. He had even donned a special pair of commemorative boots for the occasion -- bearing the date May 18 and the names of his children, Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper. Beckham was going out on a high and although PSG have an away match at Lorient to complete a triumphant season his appearance in that match is considered highly unlikely.. It was his 10th league championship title -- won with four clubs -- Manchester United, Real Madrid, Los Angeles Galaxy and now PSG, the players lifting the trophy after their final home match. The former England captain joined them for the run-in to the season and quickly won over the fans as she showed that despite his 38 years he had lost none of his trademark skills. It was on display again in his farewell home appearance, with raking cross-field balls regularly finding the target and he made the assist on PSG's second goal. PSG made a flying start with star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic putting them ahead in the fifth minute. Beckham's corner proved perfect for Blaise Matuidi to score the second with Ibrahimovic blasting the third before halftime with a thunderous free kick. Charlison Benschop pulled a late goal back for already relegated Brest, but it could not spoil the celebrations -- which went on long after the final whistle as the entire PSG squad, Beckham included, were paraded ahead of the trophy celebration. Ancelotti, who has led PSG to their first title in 19 years, said he wanted to make Beckham's farewell special. ""It was the right thing to do to choose Beckham as captain for his last match. ""All the players backed the decision. Beckham will have a lovely memory of this night,"" he told AFP. Beckham addressed fans after the match as the celebrations in the stadium continued long after the final whistle. ""Thanks to everyone in Paris, to all of my teammates, the staff and fans,"" said the former England captain. ""It's been very special to finish my career here,"" he added.","David Beckham plays final home match .

"(CNN) -- Two men who the Iranian government said worked as spies for Israel and the United States were hanged Sunday morning, according to Iranian state news outlet Press TV. The men were identified as Mohammad Heidari and Kourosh Ahmadi. Press TV said Heidari provided classified information to Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and Ahmadi had been convicted of providing the CIA with intelligence. There were no details on when the men were arrested or when they were tried. The hangings occurred at dawn, the report said. Israeli officials didn't comment on the report. The U.S. State Department acknowledged seeing the reports but had no comment. The CIA didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The advocacy group Human Rights Activists News Agency, based in Iran, estimated in 2012 that there were 488 hangings in the prior 12 months. About 12% of those were public executions, the group said, according to a State Department report. One person hanged in 2012 was Majid Jamali Fashi, who was convicted of killing an Iranian scientist. Iran said Israel paid him $120,000 to kill elementary-particle physicist Massoud Ali-Mohammadi. Iran also has blamed the United States and the United Kingdom for attacks against nuclear scientists. Iran's enrichment of uranium has been one of the most contentious issues in nuclear talks between Iran and the so-called P5+1 countries -- the United States, France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany. Iran has denied that it aims to build a nuclear bomb, claiming its nuclear program is for energy and medical use. Iran also holds a former U.S. Marine, Amir Hekmati, who was detained in August 2011 while visiting his grandmother. Iranian authorities accused him of spying for the CIA, a charge his family and the Obama administration deny. Originally he was sentenced to death during a closed-door trial, but that conviction was overturned, and the Arizona native awaits a new trial. CNN's Michael Schwartz contributed to this report.","Iran says the men were providing classified material to foreign intelligence agencies .

"(CNN) -- The fighting in Syria has taken another dangerous turn, with rebel rockets targeting Hezbollah locations in Lebanon. Rebels battling for control of Qusayr, a strategically important western town in Syria, fired rockets Sunday across the Lebanese border at the militant group's areas, the rebel Free Syrian Army said. Hezbollah, the pro-regime and pro-Iranian Shiite militia regarded as a dangerous terror group by the United States and Sunni countries, is fighting alongside President Bashar al-Assad's security forces. The Free Syrian Army claimed it fired Grad rockets from the city of Qusayr into northeastern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah areas in Hermel. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said that direct hits were reported in Hermel and that checkpoints were also targeted. Taking heart amid Syria's carnage . The official Lebanese news agency, NNA, reported the short-range strikes. The outlet said the strikes caused no damage or casualties. But the rockets underscored fears that bordering nations -- such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan -- will be sucked into the conflict, now in its third year. The White House said President Barack Obama spoke on the phone Monday to Lebanese President Michel Sleiman and ""stressed his concern about Hezballah's active and growing role in Syria, fighting on behalf of the Assad regime, which is counter to the Lebanese government's policies."" The civil war in Syria has left around 80,000 people dead and displaced a few million, the United Nations says. Qusayr, in Homs province near the Lebanese border, is now a major battle front in Syria. Cartoons that scare Syria's leader . For rebels fighting al-Assad's government, it sits along a transit route for weapons and supplies coming in from Lebanon. For the Syrian government, Qusayr is along a rebel supply line that al-Assad must neutralize to retake control of Homs and foster safer passage between the Mediterranean coast and the capital of Damascus. Fighting still raged Monday in Qusayr. A rebel spokesman, Tariq Maraey, told CNN that six people were killed in government shelling Monday. Dozens of people in the city, including Hezbollah members, were killed Sunday, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, during fighting for the city. The regime's Syrian Arab News Agency said soldiers have restored stability to the eastern side of the city ""after killing big numbers of terrorists and destroying their hideouts."" The news outlet also quoted an official source saying armed forces seized an Israeli vehicle used by ""terrorists,"" the term the government uses to describe its armed opponents. An Israeli military spokesman said the vehicle, a jeep, had been out of Israeli service for more than 10 years. ""This is a cheap propaganda attempt and nothing more,"" the spokesman said of the Syrian government report. Throughout the country, including Homs province, at least 62 people have died Monday, the LCC said. READ MORE: Violence surges in strategic Syrian city .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea on Monday fired more projectiles into the sea off its east coast, South Korean officials said, urging Pyongyang to refrain from ""tension-creating acts."" But Pyongyang described the launches as a ""regular military exercise."" The South Korean Defense Ministry still needs to analyze exactly what the North has been firing for the past three days, said Choi Yong-su, an official in the ministry representative's office. They could be short-range missiles or a new kind of large-caliber artillery rocket, the ministry said. The North fired three projectiles into waters off its east coast Saturday and a fourth Sunday. It fired two more Monday, Choi said. The short-range launches haven't so far caused major concern in Seoul or Washington. North Korea last fired this kind of projectile as recently as March, South Korea said. Nuclear weapons: Who has what? Accusations of escalation . The office of South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Monday that the North ""should not engage in tension-creating acts,"" Yonhap reported. A government statement carried Monday by the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency described the activities over the weekend as ""rocket launching drills."" It said the South's reaction to them was ""another unpardonable challenge."" ""Their description of the drills as a factor of escalating the tension on the peninsula and in the region reminds one of a thief crying, 'Stop the thief!' "" the statement said. This month's launches come after Pyongyang last week criticized the presence of a U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in a South Korean port and its reported participation in joint naval drills. The stop in Busan by the USS Nimitz and its strike group signified a move ""to escalate the tension and ignite a nuclear war against"" North Korea, the state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary last week. Also last week, North Korea announced that Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen it had sentenced to hard labor, had begun his stay at a ""special prison."" Bae, whom the North Koreans call Pae Jun Ho, was arrested in November. The North says he wanted to bring down Kim Jong Un's regime, but the U.S. and his family say he was just a tour operator. North Korea is considered to have one of the most repressive penal systems in the world. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent. Before last week, tensions in the region had eased from a period in March and April that included near daily North Korean threats of war against South Korea and the United States. U.S. and South Korean officials feared at that time that Kim's regime was planning to carry out a test launch of longer-range ballistic missiles, believed to be Musudans. The South Korean government says Musudans have a maximum range of 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles). North Korea's missile capabilities . Missiles or artillery? On Monday, South Korean Defense Ministry Spokesman Kim Min-seok said it remained unclear exactly what the North has been firing over the past few days. ""There is a possibility that the projectiles are either short-range missiles or large-caliber rockets with a similar trajectory as short-range missiles,"" he said at a regular news briefing in Seoul. South Korea suspects that North Korea is still developing large-caliber rockets and isn't yet capable of deploying them, Kim Min-seok said. That could mean the North's recent launches are tests of the weaponry. ""Large-caliber means bigger destructive power, so the threat can be greater,"" he warned. Andrew Salmon, a journalist and author based in Seoul, said over the weekend that North Korea's short-range launches should not cause the same degree of concern as the launch of a satellite or medium-range Musudan missile. ""It's a short-range tactical weapon. If any other country launched this kind of weapon, it's a routine test, nobody would be too worried. It's really simply because it's North Korea doing this that it raises concerns,"" he said. South Korean officials haven't so far said any of the projectiles were aimed at the South. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula flared in recent months after the North's long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February, both of which were widely condemned. Pyongyang's fiery rhetoric intensified in March, when the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on the regime after the nuclear test. Annual U.S.-South Korean military drills in South Korea also fueled the North's anger, especially when the United States carried out displays of strength that included nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers. North Korea is demanding recognition as a nuclear power, something the United States refuses to accept. READ MORE: More tests will take North Korea closer to nuclear missile, Pentagon says .

"London (CNN) -- It is 6am and Sue Biggs is surveying the preparations for the 100th anniversary of the Chelsea Flower Show. A team of 800 people has spent three weeks converting 11 acres of playing fields into the world's most prestigious horticulture show, as famous for attracting royalty and celebrities as garden enthusiasts. Over five days each May, 157,000 visitors troop into the Royal Hospital Chelsea in west London to see 550 exhibitors displaying magnificent show gardens, new plants and new trends in gardening. Watch: Royal visit to flower show . After 30 years in the travel industry, Biggs became director general of the Royal Horticultural Society -- the charity behind Chelsea Flower Show -- in 2010, and has already attracted a record number of members to the organization. ""I was here at 6 o'clock this morning and the excitement is fantastic,"" says Biggs. ""There's something very magical about Chelsea. If you love gardening, as I have since I was seven years old, Chelsea is the absolute pinnacle. I have to pinch myself that I'm seeing it take shape. ""This has been going on for 100 years, you are very aware of the heritage, the past that's gone before and the great people who have walked this showground, whether royalty, celebrities or great gardeners. ""Whether you love the tiny detail of a plant or the great vistas of an elaborate garden, there's always something you'll find eye-wateringly beautiful."" Chelsea Flower Show takes between 15 and 18 months to prepare, so even as the final touches are being added to this year, a team is well into planning for the 2014 show. Extravagant displays at Chelsea in the past two years have included an 80ft ""Magical Tower Garden"" and a ""Sky Garden"" with a suspended ""flying boat"", both by the Irish garden designer and television personality Diarmuid Gavin. This year Gavin is not exhibiting, and Biggs says the focus is more on plantmanship, although she has promised at least one surprise. Biggs, 57, began gardening at the age of seven when her mother gave her a packet of seeds and her own piece of garden for her birthday. ""I was smitten the minute the seeds came into flower,"" she says. ""It takes you into another world, an oasis, it's a great wind-down for me."" However, she was not trained in horticulture and had never worked in the industry until three years ago. Instead, Biggs went into the travel industry where she worked for 25 years for the upmarket operator Kuoni, rising to become managing director. In 1999, when she joined the board of Kuoni, she became the youngest ever director, the first female director and the first non-Swiss director. ""I went to Zurich for a celebratory weekend with the board, and they presented me with a card saying 'Congratulations Sue, finally we have someone to iron our shirts'. They'd be shot for that now, but at the time I found it funny."" Biggs, a longtime member of the Royal Horticultural Society, became its director general in 2010 after her husband spotted an advertisement in a Sunday newspaper and suggested a change of career. ""I laughed at him at first, but he said 'you love gardening, you'd love it,' she says. ""I decided to apply and by some miracle they chose me."" Biggs has worked on ridding the 209-year-old society of its exclusive image, promoting its charity work and has pushed membership numbers over 400,000 for the first time. ""It was never intentional, but it was seen as a gardening club for posh people. We have tried to be much more open and engage people. It's helped us to achieve a record number of members,"" she says. She has overseen the sale of one of the society's properties in London and used the money to invest in charity work, from promoting horticulture as a career option and funding plant research to opening an urban garden. ""It's one of my frustrations that people don't know the RHS is a charity,"" she says. ""We need to make people aware of the scientific research, the work in schools, prisons and communities that we do. All of that work is funded by the success of shows like Chelsea."" Back at Chelsea, Biggs is preparing for another busy day from media interviews to overseeing the start of planting once all the structures, from pavilions and marquees to rocks, boulders and hedges are in place. She is wary of treading a fine line between tradition and innovation. ""Chelsea is the most successful flower show in the world, but it needs to always have something to surprise and delight people.""

"Houston (CNN) -- Aviation fans have already named it Dreamliner 2.0. No longer grounded for safety concerns, Boeing's embattled 787 Dreamliner now has a few things to prove. Monday might be a good day to start. That's when domestic Dreamliner flights return to America's airways. At 11 a.m., United Flight 1 is scheduled to depart Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The airline plans to roll out additional 787 flights throughout the week. Some international carriers have already resumed Dreamliner service. For aviation enthusiasts it's kind of a big deal. As word spreads of Dreamliner's return, travel advisers report they're getting calls from curious fliers looking to connect with one of United's six 787s at Dreamliner hubs. They want a chance to ride the 787 and experience its fancy interior lighting, high-tech windows and mysterious anti-turbulence technology. So far, United is the only U.S. carrier flying the aircraft . Dreamliner interactive: The Boeing 787 layout . This plane is so lightweight that it can fly farther with the same amount of fuel as heavier airliners. It can carry 200-plus passengers a third of the way around the globe. Boeing says the plane's increased profitability will open more destination cities for travelers. Industry observers are curious to see what the future holds for Dreamliner, the first entire airline model to be grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration in more than 30 years. Lithium-ion batteries that overheated on two Dreamliners in January prompted authorities to ground all 50 787s worldwide, but a redesigned battery system has cleared the way for the plane's return. Behind the scenes: Boeing's Dreamliner battery fix . Here are five things about Dreamliner for American travelers to keep in mind now that it's back in service: . How safe is it? ""It's a safe airliner to get back on and fly,"" says Capt. Kevin Hiatt, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an independent aviation safety think tank. The FAA simply exercised an abundance of caution when it grounded the aircraft, he says. What travelers should take away from the grounding is ""the fact that we've got a pretty good system that works."" Still, now that all eyes are on Dreamliner in the wake of the grounding, new reports of even minor glitches are likely to make travelers nervous. Japanese airline ANA reported an incident that damaged an electrical distribution panel on a Dreamliner test flight on May 4. ANA blamed it on a nut that had not been properly tightened, calling it a ""minor issue"" unrelated to batteries. A team made up of experts from Boeing and from outside the company redesigned the battery system, which separates, insulates and ventilates the battery cells. Passenger rights advocates have screamed ""conflict of interest"" about the FAA's longstanding policy allowing Boeing to certify components of its own aircraft. They're calling for more independent testing and analysis of Dreamliner's battery fix. But Hiatt says the process is safe and as independent as possible. ""Looking at historical data, we haven't had any evidence over the years that self-certification has been responsible for any problems,"" says John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal air crash investigation agency. Travelers have such high regard for the safety of the U.S. aviation system they don't pay much attention to the kind of plane they're flying, says Brett Snyder, travel adviser and self-described ""president and chief airline dork"" of CrankyFlier.com. Most aren't worried about flying the 787, but if Dreamliner develops another problem ""then that might change things."" Goglia, who also worked for years as an airline mechanic, warns that a repeat incident with the batteries ""would severely impeach Boeing's engineering capabilities."" Success for the Dreamliner heavily relies on no repeats, Goglia says. How's its reputation? When an aircraft is hit by the first FAA grounding order for an entire airliner type in three decades, does it come with a stigma? ""They're definitely going to have some lumps in the road because of that,"" says Goglia. On the other hand, Snyder believes the ""average everyday traveler isn't looking at the specific aircraft type. They're looking at the flight times and they're looking at the prices."" ""I'm sure there are some people that are feeling like they don't want to get on it,"" says Snyder. ""They'll probably feel that way in the short term until the Dreamliner develops a ""track record of being reliable and safe."" CNN.com readers have mixed feelings about the new plane. ""If there are no further incidents absolutely no one is going to remember this in a year or two,"" wrote one commenter. ""Other troubled airplanes like the DC-10 actually killed people and still went on to be successes."" Another isn't so optimistic: ""I fly between continents 1-2 times per year and have done so for the last decade and I will NEVER set foot on a Dreamliner."" How does it feel? We'll soon find out for ourselves when we fly United Flight 1 today, but supposedly, Dreamliner air is rare up there. New cabin environmental systems allow control of air pressure and humidity. Dreamliner's cabin pressure is set to the equivalent of 6,000 feet above sea level -- compared to the traditional setting of 8,000 feet. Feeling like you're at a lower altitude lets the body absorb more oxygen, making passengers less susceptible to airsickness. Humidity in the cabin is supposed to feel more comfortable, too. Everybody talks about the windows. By pushing a button under each one, it activates energized gel embedded in the windowpane, which darkens or lightens the glass. No shades necessary. Check back here with CNN.com today and we'll let you know what these tech-laden features are really like. How does it ride? It's a mystery how it works, but the Dreamliner comes equipped with gust suppression technology that is designed to smooth the ride during moderate turbulence. Boeing is keeping its cards close to the vest. Suffice it to say sensors on the aircraft respond to turbulence and send command signals that adjust parts of the wings. Result: smoother flying, says Boeing. We'll check it out for ourselves. ""It looks pretty awesome, although I'd just rather not have turbulence -- then you don't need the gust suppression,"" jokes Snyder. ""But I think it will be interesting to see how that feels, and how the plane handles it."" How did we get here? Boeing used to think airlines felt a need for speed. But the company soon learned it had miscalculated. What the airlines really wanted was efficiency, triggering a trend toward fuel-sipping, lightweight, long-range airliners. Here's what happened: In the early 2000s, Boeing was brainstorming the next generation of airliners -- the first that would be built largely from lightweight carbon-composite materials. These new planes would jet across the nation at about 650 mph -- nearly the speed of sound. They called this idea the Sonic Cruiser. But as oil prices rose, the Sonic Cruiser took a dive. Boeing abandoned the concept, keeping the idea of a new lightweight, carbon-composite airliner. Speed was out, efficiency in. By 2003, the project had a name: Dreamliner. This year, Boeing's rival Airbus will follow Dreamliner with its A350 XWB, another sleek, long-distance fuel-sipper that can carry 200-plus passengers. Related story: Airbus rolls out sleek, new A350 XWB .

"(EW.com) -- The battle over ""Bully's"" R rating rages on. Katy Butler, a 17-year-old high school student from Michigan, delivered a petition (with more than 200,000 signatures) Wednesday to the Motion Picture Association of America's office in Sherman Oaks, California. Her message: Lower the MPAA rating of the upcoming Weinstein Company documentary from R to PG-13. ""Bully,"" a look at the rise of adolescent bullying in America, was rated R for ""some language"" -- specifically for the f-word, which is used a reported six times in the film. An R rating means that adolescents under the age of 17 -- the documentary's intended audience -- cannot see the film without an adult guardian. Butler, who came out as a lesbian in middle school and has been the victim of repeated bullying, launched the online petition on February 26. Since then, she has been featured on CNN and Fox News, and was in the audience during today's taping of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"" during which DeGeneres urged her viewers to also sign the petition. But will all of this media attention have any effect on the MPAA's decision? In response to Butler's petition, the organization released the following statement from Joan Graves, the Chairman of its Classification and Rating Administration: . ""Katy Butler's efforts in bringing the issue of bullying to the forefront of a national discussion in the context of this new film are commendable and we welcome the feedback about this movie's rating. The MPAA shares Katy's goals of shining a light on the problem of bullying and we hope that her efforts will fuel more discussion among educators, parents, and children. The voluntary ratings system enables parents to make an informed decision about what content they allow their children to see in movies. The R rating and description of 'some language' for Bully does not mean that children cannot see the film. As with any movie, parents will decide if they want their children to see Bully. School districts, similarly, handle the determination of showing movies on a case-by-case basis and have their own guidelines for parental approval. The R rating is not a judgment on the value of any movie. The rating simply conveys to parents that a film has elements strong enough to require careful consideration before allowing their children to view it. Once advised, many parents may take their kids to see an R-rated film."" With ""Bully's"" March 30 release date quickly approaching, the Weinstein Company is running out of time. The studio lost its appeal to overturn the movie's R rating, falling one vote short of the two-thirds requirement. As a result, the company was left with three options: (1) Release ""Bully"" as is with an R rating; (2) Edit or mute the profanity in order to obtain a PG-13 rating; or (3) Release the film without a MPAA rating, which could result in some theaters treating ""Bully"" as though it were actually rated NC-17. The film's director, Lee Hirsch, has already voiced his opposition to making any edits. ""To cut around [the profanity] or bleep it out, it really absolutely does lessen the impact and takes away from what the honest moment was, and what a terrifying feeling it can be [to be bullied],"" Hirsch told the AP. And the Weinstein Company believes an R rating would similarly diminish the film's influence on adolescents. ""If your parents take you or make you go [to the movie], it's like forcing a child to take medicine,"" David Glasser, the studio's COO, told EW. ""But if a kid has the ability where he can go on his own, it becomes a movement. That's one of the reasons why we need this rating changed."" So far, the Weinstein Company hasn't decided how to move forward with ""Bully,"" besides the decision to continue keeping pressure on the MPAA. ""We're contemplating all options right now regarding what's best for the movie,"" said Glasser. ""In an ideal world, it'd be great if the MPAA would say, 'Look, they got the majority vote, and in context, [the film's language] is fine.' And then everybody goes on their way and we're able to get a very powerful movie out the door."" See the full article at EW.com.

"Paris (CNN) -- A court in France has rejected a bid by lawyers to have charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn dropped over his alleged participation in a prostitution ring, a court official said. The decision of the court in Douai that the investigation -- in what is known in France as the ""Carlton affair"" -- will continue follows a string of criminal cases in which the former chief of the International Monetary Fund had managed to put sexual misconduct claims behind him. A lawyer for Strauss-Kahn, Henri Leclerc, told CNN that the defense planned to appeal the court's decision. The scandals sidelined the onetime French finance minister's prospects of becoming France's next president. Read more: Strauss-Kahn, accuser settle lawsuit . Strauss-Kahn does not deny that he attended sex parties at the Hotel Carlton in the northern city of Lille. But, his lawyers said, he did not know that the young women at the parties were being paid for sex. So, to charge Strauss-Kahn with aggravated pimping is ""unhealthy, sensationalist and not without a political agenda,"" his lawyers argued. But on Wednesday, a court in Douai ruled the charges will stand, said Guillaume Maigret, general secretary of the court. Frederique Baulieu, a lawyer for Strauss-Kahn, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV outside the court that the defense's request for annulment of the case had been well founded. ""We will continue -- we are certain that Dominique Strauss-Kahn will be cleared of all of the accusations that were made against him,"" she said. ""The one thing I can tell you is that today's decision is not a judicial victory."" Read more: Prosecutor drops Strauss-Kahn 'gang rape' probe . Strauss-Khan, a 63-year-old economist, was widely expected to become the Socialist presidential candidate -- until his professional career imploded with an arrest in New York in May 2011. A New York hotel housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, told police that a naked Strauss-Kahn emerged from a room of his spacious luxury hotel suite and tried to force himself on her, at one point dragging her into the bathroom and trying to remove her underwear. Strauss-Kahn alleged the encounter was consensual, but stepped down from his $500,000 job at the IMF. Read more: Police: Strauss-Kahn inquiry includes gang rape allegations . A grand jury indicted him on seven counts, including sexual abuse and attempted rape, but prosecutors later dropped the charges after concluding Diallo had lied about some details of the alleged attack -- despite forensic evidence that showed a sexual encounter had occurred. Diallo then sued Strauss-Kahn. The two sides reached a settlement last week, the details of which have not been disclosed. Earlier, in October, a French prosecutor dropped an investigation connecting Strauss-Kahn to a possible gang rape in Washington. The young Belgian woman whose testimony was the basis for the inquiry withdrew her previous statement and said she would not press charges, leaving the investigation with no grounds to continue, officials said. Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of attempted rape from a young French writer. Tristane Banon filed a complaint, alleging a 2003 attack. But prosecutors said the case could not be pursued because of a statute of limitations. Strauss-Kahn denied the allegations and has since filed a countersuit in France, alleging slander.

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- Former presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil called Wednesday for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in tactics on the war on drugs, a Spanish news agency said. People march in support of legalized marijuana in late January in Belem, northern Brazil. Ex-presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil made their announcement at a meeting in Brazil of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy, the EFE news agency said. ""The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,"" Gaviria said at a news conference in which the commission's recommendations were presented. The 17-member panel worked on the report for a year and will forward it to all Latin American governments as well as the United States and the European Union, EFE said. Gaviria said the time is right to start a debate on the subject, particularly with the pragmatic openings provided by the election of President Barack Obama in the United States. ""In many states in the United States, as is the case in California, they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes. And in Washington there's some consensus that the current policy is failing,"" EFE quotes Gaviria as saying. Decriminalization should be accompanied by treatment for addicts and public service campaigns on abuse prevention, the commission said. ""If you don't help those who are dependent, you are half way there because they are going to commit crime to get money and pay for the drug,"" Gaviria said. Cardoso said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because ""you have to start somewhere"" and it would have been unrealistic to ask the same for all drugs, EFE said. Marijuana was chosen because it is grown in all countries in the region and because it is ""less harmful."" The decades-old criminalization of personal consumption has failed to stop the plant's cultivation and distribution, the group said. The commission urged that all current criminal prosecution be aimed at drug cartels and organized crime and not marijuana smokers, EFE said. Zedillo did not attend the news conference but worked on the report, Cardoso said. Wednesday's recommendation was the second time in less than a week that a Latin American government official called for decriminalization. A mayor in Peru suggested Friday that the federal government legalize illicit drugs and administer them through the national health ministry. Gusto Sierra, the mayor of the Surquillo district in Lima, said a federal drug law is hypocritical because it allows maximum legally allowed quantities for some drugs and plants but doesn't say where to acquire them, the Peru 21 newspaper reported in a front-page story headlined ""Say yes to drugs?"" Sierra said he will take the matter up with the nation's executive branch. Zedillo served as president of Mexico from 1994-2000. Gaviria was president of Colombia from 1990-94. And Cardoso led Brazil from 1995-2002.","Ex-presidents of Mexico, Brazil and Colombia urge decriminalization of marijuana .

"Holon, Israel (CNN) -- She never displayed the boundless energy of other children -- all she seemed to do was cry. Her mother couldn't figure out why until a doctor examined her baby girl and broke the news. She had a heart condition that would eventually kill her if left untreated. Doctors said surgery should be done when she turned one but there was no one able to do it in her home town. The family did not have the money to go elsewhere. It was torture. The longer she waited, the worse her daughter would get. Then something happened that changed everything. War broke out in Syria and eventually spread to their town. They tried to wait it out but it raged on with non-stop ferocity. Escape from ruins . Then six months ago, the girl and her mother escaped what was left of their home. But they could not escape their child's medical problems. The girl had turned four and her condition was getting worse -- as doctors predicted. ""She could not play or walk or talk. She would get tired. She could not indulge in anything,"" her mother said. ""She could only eat very little."" The child's mother asked us to keep their identity secret because of what happened after they left Syria. Their journey eventually landed them in Israel, which is technically still at war with Syria and has been for decades. The family worries they will be seen as traitors or spies when they return to their homeland if their neighbors find out they've been inside the ""enemy state."" But the family acknowledge their journey to Israel saved the girl's life. Oxygen starved . Their perilous journey from Syria first landed them in a refugee camp with hundreds of thousands of others. Desperate and dirty, the camp was no place for a sickly child whose heart condition was slowly but surely starving her of oxygen. ""We all have in the heart two pumps but she has only one that is working,"" explained Dr. Sion Houri, the head of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at the Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, Israel. ""We have two tubes in our body -- one going to the lung, one going to the body. The one going to the lung was severely narrowed."" Dr. Houri is from an organization called ""Save a Child's Heart."" Founded in Israel in 1995 by another surgeon at the Wolfson, the non-profit organization's mission is to provide heart surgery to children wherever they are. So far they have treated 3,200 children from 44 nations. Last week they added another nation to their list, Syria. The civil war across the border sent them a child in need they would probably never been able to help due to the breakdown in relations between the two neighbors. When Save a Child's Heart heard about the little girl's plight, they jumped through all the necessary security hoops to get her the treatment she badly needed. Bridge stereotypes . ""We hope that we can contribute in our small way first and foremost to the medical care to the children in our neighborhood. We also believe that this has the ability to bring people closer together to bridge stereotypes,"" said Simon Fisher, the executive Director of Save a Child's Heart. While the treatment is free for the patients, the organization relies on donations to pay the bills that invariably need to be settled. A team of doctors and nurses at the Wolfson performed open-heart surgery on the girl. Though it was a major operation, doctors say it is a relatively simple procedure that often produces amazingly fast results. ""You can see differences that are absolutely crazy. Kids that were thought to be retarded all of a sudden start talking and walking, all they needed was a little bit of oxygen,"" Dr. Houri added. Healthy child . We met the little girl three days after surgery. Her curly hair, big brown eyes and huge smile captivated everyone around her. She was playing with bright colored plastic toys strewn alongside her bed. Though still hooked up to a machine, she acted like any typical four-year old, rather than the sickly, constantly exhausted child she was until very recently. ""Thank God, thank God, my daughter has recovered. She is so much better than before,"" her mother explained. She is incredibly relieved. She had been worried about how she would be treated -- like so many others who have come to the hospital from far afield. At the moment there are young heart patients being treated from the West Bank, Ethiopia, Sudan, China and Tanzania. As for the little Syrian girl who has survived a war and now open-heart surgery, she will need one more operation in about a year's time as her body grows. As she sits on the bed recovering from surgery, the little girl begins to sing a lullaby asking God to protect her baby brother. It turns out she was the one who needed protection the most. The mere fact the wide-eyed infant is able to sing easily without losing her breath is evidence enough to give her mother a sense of hope she hasn't felt since before her country was plunged into war.","Four-year-old girl with heart condition forced to flee home in Syria .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, NASA officials announced a serious problem with the Kepler satellite, the world's most successful planet-finding machine. Since its launch four years ago, Kepler has found more than 2,700 possible planets orbiting stars other than our Sun, of which more than 100 have been confirmed. A few of these exoplanets resemble the Earth in size or mass. Recently, three Earth-like planets were even reported to be in the habitable zone: close enough to the star they orbit that water is liquid, yet not so close that it is boiling. Planets with liquid water may well harbor life. Now, the second of four of the Kepler spacecraft's reaction wheels, which aim the vessel's instruments, appears to have failed. It remains to be seen whether full repairs are possible. For the spacecraft to point accurately, at least three reaction wheels are needed, corresponding to the three dimensions (up-down, north-south, east-west). The fourth wheel serves as a backup and provides cross-comparisons of data among the wheels. The first wheel failed last summer; now Kepler has too few reaction wheels to keep pointing with sufficient stability. When a major component like a thruster fails on any spacecraft, operations software points the craft's solar panels toward the sun to ensure a continuous power supply. Power is a satellite's lifeblood: Lose it and you lose communications, so the satellite can't be oriented properly or take data. Backup batteries allow the solar panels to be misdirected for a few hours or so, before all power is lost. But batteries drain quickly, so engineers design software to make sure that when something goes wrong, the spacecraft points in a direction that preserves power. Urry: Three more homes for life in the universe? Reaction wheels are spinning flywheels that carry ""angular momentum,"" a term roughly analogous to the force that keeps a car coasting even when the driver's foot is off the gas. Spinning objects keep spinning unless they transfer angular momentum to another object. For example, if a flywheel is commanded to spin more slowly (through an electric motor), the spacecraft will pick up spin to compensate. If the flywheel spins faster, the spacecraft will spin in the opposite direction. Increasing or decreasing the spin of a reaction wheel is therefore a way of pointing the spacecraft. This may sound like a complicated way to make a telescope move, but the problem is, there is nothing in empty space to push on. To close a door, you push on it. This works because gravity holds you firmly on the ground, and your feet stay put because of friction with the floor. If you pushed on an open door in space, it would push you in the opposite direction. In space, there is no standing still. So Kepler's reaction wheels are essential for pointing the spacecraft accurately and steadily. Unfortunately, less stable pointing means less accurate photometry (the measurement of light from the star). Since Kepler finds planets by measuring the tiny dips in a star's brightness when a dark planet moves across the face of that star, less accurate photometry means Earth-like planets will be too hard to find. Urry: A meteor and asteroid -- 1 in 100 million odds . NASA is trying to figure how to fix or work around the broken reaction wheels. It has done amazing things before; you don't have to be an optimist to think there is still a chance to turn Kepler around. But the loss of a fully functional Kepler would be terrible. It has found more potential planets than any other facility or method. Kepler data have yielded an estimate of the total number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way galaxy: at least 17 billion. That's an Earth-like planet around one in every six stars. Fortunately, there are other ways to find planets than by detecting transits (the passage of a planetary body across a sun), as Kepler does. In fact, the first few hundred exoplanets were found by the ""radial velocity"" technique, which detects tiny motions of a star as it and its planets orbit one another. A Yale astronomy professor, Debra Fischer, has pioneered clever improvements to this technique so that she can find 100 Earth-size planets, perhaps 10% of which might harbor life. (Hear the full story in Fischer's TEDx talk, ""Why We Need to Find 100 Earths."") Fischer is going after Earth-like planets in the habitable zone. After all, the discovery of life on another planet would cause a profound shift in our world view, akin to the Copernican shift from an Earth-centric to a Sun-centric world. So when Fischer says we should be ""the alien civilizations that explore other worlds,"" I say: With Kepler or without, it's only a matter of time until we find signs of life on other worlds.

"New York (CNN) -- Sunday's graduation ceremony at Hofstra University was a bittersweet affair marked by a moment of silence for a 21-year-old student killed by a police officer two days ago. Many students at the university in East Garden City, New York, wore white ribbons on their gowns in tribute to Andrea Rebello, CNN affliate WCBS reported. ""I want to express our community's collective grief and our sorrow over the senseless and tragic death of a very young member of the Hofstra family,"" university President Stuart Rabinowitz said. ""Our hearts and our thoughts and our prayers are with Andrea's family, and with her friends and classmates, many of whom are in this room this afternoon."" She was killed by police gunfire during a confrontation between a home invasion suspect and authorities Friday night, a police spokeswoman said Saturday. An officer fired eight shots at the intruder, who authorities say was holding a gun to Rebello's head during a home invasion robbery at an off-campus house in Uniondale. One shot hit Rebello in the head, Maureen Roach, a spokeswoman with the Nassau County police, said. The intruder, whom authorities identified as Dalton Smith, 30, of Hempstead, was struck seven times and died. Smith invaded the home Rebello shared with her twin sister and two others during the predawn hours on Friday. At some point, a female roommate of the twins was able to leave the home and call police, a police spokesman told CNN on Friday. When a police officer arrived, Smith told the officer he was going to kill Rebello. He turned the handgun toward the officer, she said. The officer, fearing for his life, drew his gun and fired, Roach said. Authorities have not identified the officer. At the time of the shooting, Smith was wanted for jumping parole, police said. He was on parole for first-degree robbery and had an ""extensive"" arrest history that includes robbery, assault, and promoting prison contraband, said police in Nassau County. A warrant for his arrest was issued April 25 for allegedly absconding from parole, police said . Rebello's high school principal, Carol Conklin-Spillane, said the twins' home community in Westchester was heartbroken. She described Rebello as a fun-loving, personable and self-aware young woman. Her parents, Fernando and Nella Rebello, are closely tied to the Portuguese community, and always worked to create opportunities for their children, Conklin-Spillane said. Rebello, a junior, was majoring in public relations. At Sunday's graduation ceremony, Rabinowitz recalled a Bob Marley quote that Rebello found inspiring: ""Live the life you love and love the life you live."" Hofstra University said it is offering counseling to students. A funeral Mass is planned for Wednesday. Friendly fire led to officer's shooting during Boston manhunt .

"(CNN) -- The American-bred horse who won last year's St Leger -- Encke -- is among seven more horses trained by disgraced Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni to test positive for steroids, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has announced. Encke won the St Leger last September 2012 as a 25/1 outsider and tested negative for doping after the race. His surprise victory denied Camelot the chance to become the first Triple Crown winner since 1970, with the winner of the 2,000 Guineas and Epsom Derby finishing in second place. The feat of winning the three races is so rare that only one horse has achieved it since the second world war - Nijinsky in 1970. After Al Zarooni earned an eight-year suspension when he admitted administering banned drugs to 15 horses in his care, the BHA undertook further extensive testing at his Moulton Paddocks yard. The steroid stanozolol was found in a further seven animals, so raising the tally of horses under the trainer's control to have tested positive for doping to 22. In a boost for Godolphin, whose stable was founded by the ruler of Dubai - Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - in 1992, testing on nearly 200 horses at their other yard returned no positive results. Trainer Saeed bin Suroor, who runs the Stanley House stable in Newmarket, will now take control of Moulton Paddocks, the yard formerly licensed to Al Zarooni. ""We welcome the news that Saeed bin Suroor's horses tested negative and this clears the way for him to now take charge of Moulton Paddocks,"" said Paul Bittar, Chief Executive of BHA. In a statement posted on Godolphin's website, racing manager Simon Crisford said: ""It is obviously very disappointing that seven further horses have tested positive for stanozolol. ""These results highlight why Sheikh Mohammed took the decision to lock down the stables at Moulton Paddocks until every Godolphin horse in training at Newmarket had been tested. ""All of Saeed bin Suroor's horses have tested clear and we are working with the BHA to put everything back in order at Moulton Paddocks."" The BHA said no further action will be taken against Al Zarooni, who has appealed the ban given to him in April and who says he was unaware that the use of anabolic steroids out of competition was banned in the United Kingdom. The practice is allowed in Australia and Dubai, where Al Zarooni was based prior to taking control of Moulton Paddocks in 2010. ""We will not be taking any separate action in respect of these additional positive results whilst Mr Al Zarooni's appeal process is ongoing,"" said Adam Brickell, the body's Director of Integrity, Legal and Risk. ""In the meantime, the latest findings will form the subject of further interviews as part of the BHA's continuing investigation."" Following testing of 391 horses, the six to join Encke in British racing's most serious drugs scandal are his full brother Genius Beast as well as Energizer, Improvisation, Stamford, Steeler and Zip Top. Like the other 15 to have previously tested positive, all the horses will be unable to compete for the next six months at the very least. Both Godolphin and Al Zarooni can ask for the samples to be subjected to B sample analysis, with a decision to take up that option required by Thursday. While no date has yet been set for Al Zarooni's hearing, which will take place no earlier than the last week of June, those in charge of the Godolphin stables must be hoping that the worst is now over.","St Leger winner Encke is latest horse to be caught up in British racing's doping scandal .

"(CNN) -- Fashion Week in New York, London, Milan and Paris have ended in a flash of ruby-reds, turtlenecks and thigh-high boots. But what about Charleston, Nashville, Austin or Cleveland? Granted, these aren't cities where editors, buyers and bloggers from around the world flock to discover next season's trends. But, regardless of what the Onion thinks of Iowa's style sense, regional fashion weeks matter to the communities that host them -- and they're starting to catch the attention of big-city fashion folk, too. After all, ""not all designers are born and bred in New York, Paris and Milan,"" said Fern Mallis, who's credited with creating New York Fashion Week as we currently know it. After her success there, she helped launch and guide fashion weeks in Sydney, Shanghai, Miami and Cleveland as senior vice president of IMG Fashion in the 2000s. Photos: New York Fashion Week . Each year seems to herald the launch of a fashion week in a smaller, regional U.S. city and, unlike their famous counterparts, runway shows aren't always the main event. Cleveland's schedule in May includes pop-up boutiques, wine and cheese parties and a screening of ""Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel,"" a documentary about the influential fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar and editor-in-chief of Vogue. In April, Nashville Fashion Week will offer a day of industry panels and several nights of runway shows featuring a mix of hometown heroes and established brands such as Tracy Reese and Nonoo. Yes, in some cities, the weeks are basically glorified business-boosting happy hours where flavored vodka drinks and rose flow liberally from local boutiques. There's a bit of navel-gazing, to be sure. But, as Mallis put it, what's the harm in trying? ""Regional fashion weeks are aspirational. I find something very refreshing and honest about them,"" Mallis said. ""If the sidebar is that restaurants and hotels get a lot of business, even better. ""The fashion industry is always looking for the next hot talent and you never know where you'll find it. It's a funny industry, where you need to be seen, and the best way for designers' work to be seen is on the runway, wherever it is."" ""Project Runway"" Season 11 contestant Amanda Valentine credits her participation in Nashville Fashion Week for the boost she needed to make the cut on the reality TV show. She earns a living as a stylist in Music City's entertainment industry while still cultivating her brand from a studio in the basement of her Nashville home. But during fashion week, local organizers tend to provide models, hair and makeup services, saving designers like her thousands of dollars. Valentine auditioned for ""Project Runway"" in 2009 but didn't make the final cut. After participating in Nashville Fashion Week, she returned for auditions in 2012 with a portfolio of professional runway images and press clips lauding her work. ""The exposure and press helps because it gives you an outside opinion that you can point to,"" Valentine said. ""Having the professional images and the ability to say 'I participated in a show' also adds to your credibility."" Designers to watch after New York Fashion Week . Usually, runway shows distinguish the boozy shopping parties from events with the potential to propel young designers. A show in Nashville, Tennessee, or Austin, Texas, can give designers a chance to shine or stumble -- without the intensely critical media eye that looms over London or Paris. It just takes some time for a regional fashion week to grow from one to the other. Charleston Fashion Week in South Carolina started out as a ""chic party"" in Marion Square and along King Street, where fashionistas hobnobbed over cocktails. In seven years, it has grown into an event that draws promising talent, industry heavyweights and thousands of attendees. Last year, the event's economic impact was $2.4 million, according to figures from the Charleston Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. The emerging designer competition is the event's centerpiece. The nightly showdown began Tuesday, whittling down a roster of 20 aspiring designers to five finalists, who sent their collections down the runway Saturday night in a bid for the grand prize. The winner takes home $5,000 in cash, $10,000 in online marketing and promotional services, a book of professional runway images of the winning collection, and a sewing machine. Prizes like that would certainly help semifinalist Afriyie Poku, who makes a living doing custom alterations on a secondhand sewing machine in his Atlanta apartment. He's also on call for tailoring jobs at a hotel he quit last month to free up time to work on his menswear collection. The tall-haired, Ghana-born Atlantan transformed the living room of his Midtown apartment into a workshop after being selected in December to participate in the contest. Portrait of a Man Repeller at NYFW . His design idol is Ralph Lauren, so naturally his collection is based on traditional menswear silhouettes with what he calls an ""attention to detail that brings it into the modern era."" Poku takes pride in his fashion-forward embellishments, such as high-waisted riding pants with reverse pleats, a side zipper or leather inseam patches, and a double-breasted morning coat lined to be warm enough on its own. The self-taught tailor says he has a character or archetype in mind for each piece -- the hunter, the gentleman -- but he acknowledges that he's designing for himself. That's how he learned to sew, by altering clothes to his liking, in a fitted, tailored style inspired by his uncles, businessmen in Ghana, even if his first creation was a pair of pants made from a bedsheet. ""My view was, 'Everything you wear has to fit well,'"" Poku said. ""But when I went to Macy's, things were not made to fit as I wanted, so I'd buy clothes and made them to fit like I wanted them to fit."" In the month before the competition, he stayed awake for days at a time to finish the collection. In the home he shares with his girlfriend, an aspiring opera singer, he pieced together 12 fall menswear runway looks -- eight for the semifinal and four more in case he advanced to Saturday night's final. Poku said he doesn't want to start his own label or become a ""Project Runway""-style celeb just yet. For now, his goal is to find an apprenticeship with an established menswear designer or contract sewer. ""I just want to give it a try and see what happens,"" he said in an interview last week in a home studio littered with spools of thread and bags of fabric. ""Even if I don't win, I feel like just being there will help me find what I need to advance to the next level."" In Charleston, he knew he'd have the eyes of an appreciative local community, as well as some established designers from the upper echelons of high fashion. Christian Siriano already has a foothold in the industry. Celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Rihanna and Heidi Klum wear his gowns on the red carpet. He has a flagship store in New York and an eponymous line sold in Neiman Marcus and boutiques around the world. Still, he had a full schedule this week in Charleston. ""We look at it as a business opportunity to find new customers and form new relationships with retailers,"" said Siriano, the youngest designer to win ""Project Runway"" or land on Crain's 40 Under 40 list. ""Who wants to alienate a customer who's ready to shop?"" Siriano already showed his ballet-inspired Fall 2013 collection in New York and Paris, but he brought it to Charleston for a show Saturday. On Friday he participated in a trunk show hosted by a family-owned department store, Gwynn's of Mount Pleasant, where he would like to see his clothes sold, he said. He also judged the emerging designer competition, along with Mallis and other industry insiders and entertainers: singer-songwriter Ashanti, designers Brandon Sun and Antonio Azzuolo and Hannah Goff, winner of the 2012 Charleston emerging designer competition. Cynthia Rowley judged the emerging designer competition in 2009, when swimwear designer Marysia Reeves won. Since then, Reeves' swimwear has been featured in publications including Vogue and WWD, and her collections have been picked up by Barneys New York, Anthropologie and other high-end boutiques around the world. ""Charleston has a sophisticated, fashion-savvy audience, so it's just a matter of making my products more accessible to them,"" said Rowley, who was in the city this week to visit her King Street store and promote her latest collection for Belk department stores. ""It's also a great way for me to learn more about what's happening in fashion in that part of the country."" The emerging designer competition final drew hundreds of people Saturday. The competition was tight, but ultimately the panel chose Poku as the winner, with Mallis describing his collection as ""something special."" He also won the audience favorite award, another $250 prize. Dozens of fans swarmed around him, making it hard for his sisters and girlfriend to reach him. As far as he was concerned, the win vindicated his efforts. ""It's shown me I am meant for this,"" he said of his win. ""This is my way in life. Any impact I'll be able to make on the human race will be in this field."" Follow Emanuella Grinberg on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- During a protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square a month after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak, Bothaina Kamel spotted a slogan supporting womens' right to be president of Egypt. She said: ""At that moment, I thought we shouldn't just be saying that, we should be putting it into practice."" A month later, Kamel announced she was to become Egypt's first female presidential candidate for elections expected to be held early next year. Kamel, 49, is not new to the spotlight in Egypt. She is a television presenter and political campaigner who once resigned from her job as a newsreader on state television because she did not believe the news she was reading. She is an outsider to heavyweight candidates such as Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and Amr Moussa, former secretary general of the Arab League, but Kamel believes her campaign is gaining momentum. Although no date has yet been set for the election, Kamel, is already touring the country in an attempt to reach the people she says have been forgotten by the political elite of Cairo. She admits she does not have a budget like the mainstream candidates, or the entourage of bodyguards, but claims to have an army of passionate supporters meeting her wherever she goes. ""From the day I announced my candidacy we have achieved a lot,"" she said. ""We have moved through the villages and brought the revolution to all of Egypt, not just the big cities."" Describing herself as a social democrat, Kamel has made it her mission to listen to grievances of minorities. She said: ""I promise by the election I will be the most informed of the candidates about the Egyptian people. I know the demands of the Bedouin, the people of Upper Egypt, the Coptic Christians, the workers and different groups from all parts of the country."" Kamel believes the hard graft is paying off and winning her acceptance as a woman candidate. She said: ""At first people were shocked, and after that they took me lightly, but now they are taking me more seriously. ""They told me the Egyptian people can't accept a woman president but now they accept me. ""The stereotype of Egyptians is that they won't vote for a woman, but people will vote for someone who can help them. If I'm ready to help people, they will vote for me. People are very practical."" Kamel's career in radio and television began soon after she graduated from Cairo University, where she was active in student politics. For six years, she hosted a late-night radio show called ""Night Confessions"" before it was abruptly suspended in 1998. She went on to host a television show called ""Argook Efhamni"" -- or ""Please Understand Me"" -- for the Saudi-owned Orbit network for 10 years, before that too was taken off air earlier this year. In 2005, Kamel and two other women founded a movement called ""Shayfeen,"" or ""We Are Watching You"" to observe Egypt's first multi-party elections, and made a documentary about their efforts. She is now putting together a documentary of the same name about her experiences on the campaign trail, and is accompanied by a cameraman wherever she goes. The slogan for Kamel's campaign -- Egypt is My Agenda -- stems from her experience during the 18 days of Egypt's revolution in January and February this year. ""When we were in Tahrir Square, the official media said we were part of a foreign agenda, so I chose the slogan 'Egypt Is My Agenda.'"" That revolution is still a work in progress, according to Kamel, who is vocal in her criticism of interim government, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. She said: ""I know that we have just started a revolution, we haven't made a revolution yet. There's a lot more to do. ""It's still possible that we will see the blood coming, like in Libya and Syria because the army council wants to stay and try to kill the revolution, and one of the dirty schemes is to put the Egyptian people in a helpless state economically. ""Now the Egyptians can't feel good from the revolution."" Such strong words don't make her popular with everyone, but her calls for a complete change in politics resonate with many. Walid Kazziha, professor of politics at the American University of Cairo, said she is well-known among young people, a familiar face in Tahrir Square during the revolution and famously outspoken, particularly in her criticism of the military council. He said: ""On one occasion she was being interviewed on national TV after the revolution and when she criticized the military council the interviewer announced that he got orders to terminate the interview from his superiors."" Young people -- much credited with bringing about Egypt's revolution -- are central to Kamel's philosophy. ""What we need is not only a political revolution but also a social revolution,"" she said. ""Politics under the Mubarak regime was thugs and black deals, so I want to work to build new values for Egypt."" She added: ""I believe in tolerance and dialogue between the generations. I tell the elders we must respect our sons and daughters and take them seriously."" Kamel, a divorcee with one daughter, has just remarried. Her wedding to the activist judge Ashraf El Baroudi, a campaigner for judicial independence, slotted in between campaigning, trips abroad to speak at conferences on women's issues and studying law part-time at university. The wedding was the day after Kamel's telephone interview with CNN. A few days later she flew to Kenya for a summit of African women. ""I'm always busy,"" she said. ""It's important to keep learning.""","Bothaina Kamel plans to stand as Egypt's first female presidential candidate .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona beat Valladolid 2-1 Sunday night before lifting the La Liga trophy for the 22nd time in front of their fans at a sodden Nou Camp. The ground was just over half full, the lowest attendance of the season, but it could not dampen the celebrations of the Barca squad, who have dominated in the league this campaign. With Lionel Messi sitting out the rest of the season with a hamstring injury, it was left to Pedro Rodriguez to put Barca ahead in the first half. An own goal from Marc Valiente doubled the advantage before the visitors hit back with a Victor Perez penalty in the 89th minute. At the presentation, club captain Carles Puyol left it to manager Tito Vilanova and fellow defender Eric Abidal, who have both been absent as they battled cancer this season, to lift the trophy. ""It's been a difficult year, but the most important thing is that Abidal and Tito are with us,"" he told the club's official website. ""I want to thank you all for your confidence and support in the good and bad moments,"" Vilanova told the supporters. If the Catalan giants win their remaining two matches, they will equal the 100 points record total of arch rivals Real Madrid. Elsewhere Sunday, FC Porto sealed their 27th Portuguese league title after beating Pacos de Ferreira 2-0. It was their third championship in a row and they finished a point ahead of bitter rivals Benfica, who beat Moreirense 3-1 in their final league match. In Italy's Serie A, a late penalty from Mario Balotelli and the winner from Frenchman Phillipe Mexes gave AC Milan a dramatic 2-1 victory at Siena. The last-gasp win clinched third and the final Champions League spot for Milan, who had fallen behind to a 25th minute goal from Claudio Terzi. It meant Fiorentina's 5-1 thrashing of Pescara, with Adem Ljajic scoring a hat-trick, proved academic as the Florence side finished fourth, two points adrift of Milan.","Barcelona beat Valladolid 2-1 in Nou Camp .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's highest court declared the parliament invalid Thursday, and the country's interim military rulers promptly declared full legislative authority, triggering fresh chaos and confusion about the country's leadership. The Supreme Constitutional Court found that all articles making up the law that regulated parliamentary elections are invalid, said Showee Elsayed, a constitutional lawyer. The ruling means that parliament must be dissolved, state TV reported. Parliament has been in session for just over four months. It is dominated by Islamists, a group long viewed with suspicion by the military. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, in control of the country since Mubarak's ouster, said that it now has full legislative power and that by Friday it will announce a 100-person assembly that will write the country's new constitution. The real obstacle to democracy in Egypt . The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest Islamist party, said SCAF leaders were taking matters into their own hands ""against any true democracy they spoke of."" The court also ruled that former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister to serve under ousted President Hosni Mubarak, may run in a presidential election runoff this weekend. The court rejected a law barring former members of Mubarak's regime from running in the election. The runoff Saturday and Sunday pits Shafik against Mohamed Morsi, head of the Freedom and Justice Party, which is the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm. Shafik, at a news conference in Cairo, praised the high court for rejecting the rule preventing former regime members from running. ""The age of settling accounts is over and gone. The age of using the law and the country's institutions against any individual is over,"" he said. Mahmoud Ghozlan, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, said a court ruling to ban Shafiq was unnecessary. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? ""We will put all our efforts into the upcoming elections so that Morsi wins and we avoid the rebirth of the old regime overnight,"" he said. Yet some Freedom and Justice members, including parliamentarian Mohamed el-Beltagy, called the rulings ""a complete coup d'etat through which the military council is writing off the most noble stage in the nation's history."" Ashraf Khalil, an Egyptian-American journalist and author of the book ""Liberation Square,"" predicted that the Muslim Brotherhood, which has ""shied away"" from ""straight-up confrontation"" with the military leadership, won't ""go to war over this."" ""The activist community, on the other hand, they are very upset,"" he said. Hossam Bahgat of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights decried the court's decisions in a tweet. ""Egypt just witnessed the smoothest military coup,"" said Bahgat ""We'd be outraged if we weren't so exhausted."" Perhaps guarding against more popular unrest, riot police and military personnel, some in armored vehicles, were outside the court ahead of the rulings. Military intelligence officers were also present. After the ruling about Shafik was announced, a crowd of citizens shouted their disapproval. Military police moved to block the road in front of the court -- a major Cairo artery. Shadi Hamid, director of research at the independent Brookings Doha Center, called the court rulings the ""worst possible outcome"" for Egypt and declared that he felt the transition to civilian rule is ""effectively over."" ""Egypt is entering into a very dangerous stage and I think a lot of people were caught by surprise,"" he said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that, even with the rulings, ""We expect a full transfer of power to a democratically elected civil government. There can be no going back on the democratic transition called for by the Egyptian people."" Some activists and analysts, like Khalil, described the court's decisions as politically motivated. But Amre Moussa -- a former foreign minister under Mubarak, Arab League chief and most recently presidential candidate -- offered an opposite view, saying everyone knew that a decision was coming Thursday. ""It is not a political move,"" he said. ""It is a legal matter that has been referred to a tribune by individuals."" Calling the previously instituted constitutional panel ""unsatisfactory for many parties"" because of the influence in it held by the Muslim Brotherhood, Moussa said he understood the military's commitment to address the matter in the coming days. He also said that whomever is elected president will be key in moving the country forward, downplaying the fact a finalized constitution may not be in place by the time Morsi or Shafik take office. ""The president will be responsible for so many things, we'll have to see the actions that the president makes,"" said Moussa, calling an earlier ""constitutional declaration"" on the president's powers sufficient. For Egypt's trapped and teeming, revolution has barely begun . Many voters were unhappy with both choices in the runoff. Morsi and Shafik are the most nonrevolutionary of all candidates and represent ""two typically tyrannical institutions: the first (Morsi) being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the second (Shafik) a senior official of the former regime,"" Sonya Farid wrote for Al Arabiya earlier. ""Everything about Egypt's revolution has been unexpected, and the first-round results in the country's first-ever competitive presidential elections are no different,"" Omar Ashour, director of Middle East studies at the University of Exeter and visiting scholar at the Brookings Doha Center, wrote for Project Syndicate previously. Egypt's voters ""overwhelmingly chose the revolution over the old regime ... but their failure to unite on a single platform directly benefited Shafik,"" Ashour said. Thursday's rulings come a day after Egypt's military-led government imposed a de facto martial law, extending the arrest powers of security forces. Egypt's Justice Ministry issued a decree Wednesday granting military officers the authority to arrest civilians, state-run Egypt News reported. The mandate remains in effect until a new constitution is introduced, and could mean those detained could remain in jail for that long,Â the agency said. Lawyers for the Muslim Brotherhood filed a court appeal against the decree on Thursday, the same day Clinton ""expressed concern"" about measures she said appeared ""to expand the power of the military to detain civilians and to roll back civil liberties."" A decades-old emergency law that critics said gave authorities broad leeway to arrest citizens and hold them indefinitely without charges expired on May 31. The political scene in Egypt remains tense after the parliament failed to agree on a committee to write a new constitution defining the powers of the president and the parliament. Are you there?

"(CNN) -- The odds turned against a bettor after police say he was caught on camera using special contact lenses to cheat at a Connecticut casino. Bruce Koloshi, 54, of Summit, New Jersey, who was known in other casinos as a card marker, was observed by Mohegan Sun Casino surveillance playing at a ""Mississippi Stud"" table game, Connecticut State Police said in a statement. Upon reviewing the video footage, it was determined that Koloshi was marking cards with an ink-type substance that was made visible through special contact lenses that he was wearing, the statement said. After he was arrested, Koloshi provided a false name, but his true identity was revealed through his fingerprints, police said. Koloshi had an outstanding warrant in Louisiana on gaming-related charges, police said. Koloshi was charged in Connecticut with being a fugitive from justice, cheating, conspiracy and criminal impersonation. He was arraigned on Monday and did not enter a plea. He is currently being held on a $300,000 bond, according to the Norwich Superior Court. Koloshi's attorney, John Maxwell, declined to comment.

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- People love to be the first person to do something. Anything. Look no further than those annoying posts on blogs and online news stories where someone simply writes, ""FIRST!"" because they're celebrating being the first person to comment. Or watch any news program and see how they will report the detail of any minor celebrity in the off chance that it leads to a bigger, more exciting story. Then they can run ads that say, ""We were the first news team to bring you the story of Jennifer Aniston's new puppy."" Now, imagine if you could get paid to be that cool, hip person who gets try products and services before anyone else? When everyone else is claiming to have discovered this awesome new technology gadget, you can say, ""Oh, that? Yeah, I tried it out months ago."" With that pioneering (and braggart) spirit in mind, we put together a list of five jobs that let you try new things before they hit the market. You not only get paid to be the first person to try a new item, but your opinion matters. You can't beat that. CareerBuilder.com: Food workers, nurses forced to work sick . Here are five jobs that let you try an item before everyone else buys it: . 1. Video game tester . Yes, people are paid to test video games. This job isn't all fun and games, although it sort of is. But someone has to try new video games and look for flaws or glitches so programmers and designers can fix them before the release date. Consider how complicated today's video games are -- you're immersed in an interactive world that has come a long way from the 2-D world of Mario and Luigi. There are bound to be items that are overlooked, like a door that leads to nowhere or a secret code that doesn't do what it's supposed to. 2. Consumer Reports researcher . Independent testing organization Consumer Reports carries out extensive tests on products, such as cars, gadgets and home furnishings. A dedicated staff researches a product that is put through a battery of tests. They then administer a grade and detailed report for the product so that consumers know what its positive and negative attributes are. CareerBuilder.com: Have an incompetent boss? You're not alone . 3. Blogger . As blogging has shifted from a niche activity for a few writers to a respected outlet for news and topical conversations, bloggers have been granted some impressive privileges. Among them is access to conferences and company events, such as the unveiling of a new smartphone. Months before a new music player, smartphone or computer lands in your local retail store, the company announces it with great fanfare at a launch event. Bloggers who have large readership and respect in an industry are given prime seats at these events, where they can get their hands on these new gadgets minutes after they're unveiled. 4. Ice cream tester . If you thought testing video games was fun, consider the sheer joy of getting paid to try ice cream. Before you pick up a pint of a new, exotic flavor at the grocery store, someone had to make sure it was edible. For every whacky flavor like bubble gum, some food scientists tried out less successful flavors like spaghetti or pumpkin-wheatgrass. So the idea of eating ice cream for a living sounds fun until you realize it also means tasting some undesirable attempts, too. (Not to mention the damage done to your waistline.) CareerBuilder.com: Conflicting career advice: Which is right . 5. Critics . Before you see the must-see movie of the year, someone had to declare it a must-see film. Critics get to screen films weeks or months in advance so they can write a review for a magazine or newspaper before opening day. Music critics also get first stab at new albums. Record labels and movie studios give critics first access because their reviews drum up publicity for the respective projects -- and they hope the reviewers are positive, though there's no guarantee.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Slain Santa Monica gunman John Zawahri left behind a note on his body apologizing for killing his father and his brother and hoping his father's estate would support his mother, police said Friday. Zawahri, 23, who lived with his father in a house that was also set afire, wrote a three- to four-page handwritten letter in which he spent a ""larger"" measure of it saying good-bye to his friends than talking about his family, police said. Authorities described the tone of the letter as ""conversational talk"" without ""overall hatred to anything,"" a police spokesman said. ""He was sorry for having killed his father. He was sorry for having killed his brother, that he hoped his mother would be looked after financially and that she would receive financial recompense from the father's estate, and he said goodbye to his friends,"" said Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said. ""It was more of a farewell,"" Seabrooks added. Santa Monica shooting survivor: 'Thank God, I'm alive' No motive to his alleged shooting -- in which a total of five people were killed -- was given in the note, she said. Police revealed Friday that Zawahri tried a buy a weapon in 2011, but the U.S. Justice Department issued a notice stating that Zawahri was ineligible to buy a firearm. Seabrooks said the Justice Department denial ""may have something to do with our contact with him in 2006, but I'm not sure."" Police had contact with Zawahri in 2006, but because he was a juvenile then, authorities weren't releasing further information, the chief said. Zawahri had suffered mental health issues, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN last week. A couple of years ago, he was hospitalized for treatment after allegedly talking about harming someone, according to the official. It's not clear whether the California state government or his family committed him for treatment or whether he committed himself. It's also unclear under what circumstances he was released. Zawahri used firearm components to construct a rifle that is illegal to possess, Seabrooks said Friday. Shooting takes 5 lives . He allegedly fired 100 or fewer rounds during a shooting rampage across Santa Monica, adjacent to Los Angeles, that ended at the Santa Monica College, where police shot him to death, authorities said. He was armed with multiple guns and about 1,300 rounds of ammunition, police said. When asked where or how Zawahri obtained the firearms used in the shootings -- especially after the Justice Department deemed him ineligible to buy weapons -- Santa Monica Police Sgt. Richard Lewis stated: ""That is a part of the investigation that we will not disclose."" His father and brother died of gunshot wounds, and their bodies were found in the back of the father's Santa Monica house, a police spokesman said. Their bodies were identifiable, ""and it's not that they were burned beyond recognition,"" the chief said. Neighbors said the parents were divorced. The mother has spoken with investigators, but the police chief didn't elaborate further. Zawahri was unemployed and hadn't attended Santa Monica College, where his shooting rampage ended, since 2010, a police spokesman said Friday.

"(CNN) -- Gunfire and explosions echo in the background as the 26 year-old fighter calmly adjusts his weapons. The sounds of war, once terrifying and alien, are now utterly familiar to the young man who goes by the pseudonym Abu Wasfi. ""I used to demonstrate peacefully,"" Abu Wasfi recalls. ""I joined the Free Syrian Army after my brother was killed"". Staring out the window with his weapon ready, he surveys the street below and the war scarred buildings across the road as he continues to tell his brother's story. ""My brother defected from the Syrian army. He defected because he was told to kill innocent civilians and given orders to shoot at demonstrators,"" says Abu Wasfi. Abu Wasfi says his brother was killed defending the same neighborhood he is now trying to protect. ""This is his gun, this is my martyr brother's gun,"" Abu Wasfi says, gesturing at his AK-47 assault rifle. ""I am following in his footsteps to protect the people."" Abu Wasfi is part of a rebel fighting force that says it is protecting the neighborhood of Khaldiye in the flashpoint city of Homs. This particular frontline is Cairo Street, which separates the opposition stronghold from al-Bayada, which is held by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government forces. Your take: Should the U.S. intervene in Syria? Clashes between both sides have rendered the once-bustling middle class shopping street into a combat wasteland. Piles of rubble and burnt out vehicles form makeshift fighting positions. Debris covers the road and sidewalk, buildings are pock-marked with bullet and shrapnel holes, and shredded store awnings flap feebly in the breeze. Khaldiye seems deserted, but the fighters of the Free Syrian Army here say it's not just about defending residents who remain -- it's also about defending the property of those who have left. The rebels claim that Assad loyalists would steal or destroy anything they can get their hands on, accusing them of ransacking and shooting up homes of anyone they suspect of speaking out against the government. The local rebel commander, who goes by Abu Hadid, crawls through holes fighters smashed between buildings to be able to stealthily move around. Syrian government forces are just across the road. Shouldering a Russian-made Draganov sniper rifle, he greets some of his men in the staircase. The crude fighting position is inside one of the rooms. A hole in the wall is covered by a slab of metal with a slit that Abu Hadid points his weapon through. One of his men tells him to look to the left, to the balcony. ""Is it where the red and blue towels are?"" Abu Hadid asks -- and then, having spotted the target, the 32-year-old fires. Down the road at another battle position, Abu Al-Baraa has his enemy in sight. He opens fire with his machine gun. The response from the government forces is immediate and intense. ""Give me the radio, give me the radio,"" Abu Al-Baraa calls out as a hail of bullets from government forces drowns out his orders. Suddenly movement is spotted to the left. ""There is it, there it is!"" someone shouts. An armored police personnel carrier (APC) creeps into the alleyway, unleashing a deafening volley of bullets from its .50-caliber machine gun. A rebel voice mocks the notion of a ceasefire: ""Look Kofi Annan, this is Khaldiya, Homs,"" he says as the APC moves back and fires directly at the rebel fighting position. Hazem, another machine gunner, says indignantly: ""We can't just have a one-sided ceasefire -- they can't expect us to come under fire and not respond."" So far any attempts at diplomacy and dialogue between the Assad government and the opposition have failed. A growing number of civilians are joining the armed struggle, believing it is their only chance after having paid a bitter price these last 15 months for daring to defy the regime. The men fighting on Cairo Street -- and many others fighting across the country -- say they will carry on until the bitter end, even if it means the uprising becomes a civil war.","Exclusive video shows gun battle between Syrian rebels and regime forces in Homs .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A small Georgia town may soon require every household to own a firearm -- a law that, if passed, would make it the second town in the state to mandate gun ownership. City council members in Nelson, a town of 1,300 people north of Atlanta, unanimously approved the proposal at a meeting this week. Citizens now have a chance to review the proposal before the council takes it up again in April. ""Basically this is a deterrent ordinance,"" Councilman Duane Cronic said at the meeting. ""It's no more than putting a sign in your front yard saying that 'ADT protects this home.' Now the person that may be there (checking) your home out to cause harm to you or your family to break into your house has to decide, 'When I break that door down, what's on the other side of that door?'"" The law would give every family the right to protect themselves and their property ""without worrying about prosecution for protecting themselves,"" Cronic told the meeting. He said the proposal was modeled on a similar law in nearby Kennesaw, Georgia, that has been on the books since 1982. Nelson Police Chief Heath Mitchell told council members the proposal is a great idea. ""I think y'all are showing the people that you're in full support of the Constitution,"" Mitchell said. ""And as far as the Second Amendment goes, that you stand behind it, you stand behind people's rights."" The two-paragraph proposal reads, ""In order to provide for the emergency management of the city, and further in order to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition therefore."" People with physical or mental disabilities are exempt from the law, as are ""paupers,"" felons, and those who oppose gun ownership based on belief or religious doctrine.

"(CNN) -- Current TV's co-founders, including former Vice President Al Gore, announced Friday that the network has ousted its highest-profile on-air personality, Keith Olbermann. ""Current was ... founded on the values of respect, openness, collegiality and loyalty to our viewers,"" Gore and Joel Hyatt wrote in an ""open letter"" to viewers on the network's website. ""Unfortunately these values are no longer reflected in our relationship with Keith Olbermann, and we have ended it."" Olbermann responded sharply in a series of Twitter messages Friday, saying that for more than a year he has been ""imploring"" Gore and Hyatt ""to resolve our issues internally."" He did not specify what those issues were. ""Nevertheless, Mr. Gore and Mr. Hyatt, instead of abiding by their promises and obligations and investing in a quality news program, finally thought it was more economical to try to get out of my contract,"" the left-wing news personality wrote. ""It goes almost without saying that the claims against me in Current's statement are untrue and will be proved so in the legal actions I will be filing against them presently,"" Olbermann added, vowing later that the ""truth of the ethics"" of Gore and Hyatt eventually ""will come out."" Besides its statement, Current TV offered no further comment. This marks the second time in 15 months that Olbermann has abruptly left a news network. In January 2011, he cut ties with MSNBC after eight years. In that time, the former sports news anchor became a favorite of progressives for challenging rivals at Fox News and elsewhere. But he also faced criticism and publicly aired his frustrations with NBC's management. The 53-year-old was suspended from MSNBC for two days after the news website Politico revealed that he had made donations to three Democrats. Weeks after leaving MSNBC, Olbermann inked a deal with Current Media, a company founded by Gore and Hyatt. Besides hosting and producing his new prime-time nightly news and commentary show, Olbermann was named Current Media's chief news officer and had an equity stake in the company. He relaunched his signature ""Countdown"" show last June, showcasing a host of liberal-leaning guests and the return of his ""Special Comment"" segment. In his Twitter statement Friday, Olbermann said that his decision to join Current was ""sincere and well intentioned ... on my part, but in retrospect a foolish one."" ""That lack of judgment is mine and mine alone, and I apologize again for it,"" he wrote. His immediate replacement in the network's 8 p.m. slot will be former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Gore and Hyatt announced. Spitzer hosted a prime-time CNN show from September 2010 until last July, when ""In the Arena"" was canceled as part of an evening lineup shuffle. He had resigned as New York's governor in 2008 after it was revealed that he visited a high-priced prostitute. He joins a network -- whose current president, David Bohrman, was CNN's former Washington bureau chief -- that is available via cable or satellite TV in 60 million U.S. households and in an additional 11 million internationally, according to Current's website. The network notes that it has won two Emmys, a Peabody award and various other honors.","NEW: Keith Olbermann says he was ""foolish"" to join Current in the first place .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is considering the possibility of removing all U.S. troops in Afghanistan after the NATO combat mission officially finishes at the end of 2014, White House officials said Tuesday. The comments by Ben Rhodes, the White House's deputy national security adviser, come as the Pentagon and White House mull over the number of troops that could be left in Afghanistan after 2014 to fight insurgents and train Afghan security forces. Afghan President Hamid Karzai and President Obama are scheduled to meet on Friday in Washington. Presidents look to future of Afghanistan . Rhodes said the administration is considering a range of options, with one scenario having no U.S. troops there. The range, according to defense officials, had until recently been between 6,000 and 15,000 U.S. troops possibly remaining in the country, based on an assessment by the U.S. top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen. ""We have an objective of making sure there's no safe haven for al Qaeda within Afghanistan and making sure that the Afghan government has a security force that is sufficient, again, to assure the stability of the Afghan government and the denial of that safe haven,"" Rhodes said. ""That's what causes us to look for different potential troop numbers or not having potential troops in the country,"" he continued. Rhodes said there were no expectations of any deal on post-2014 troop levels during the Karzai visit, and he said it could be months before any decision was made. Suicide bombing kills 5 . The White House remains committed to ensuring Afghanistan does not return to its status as a safe haven for Al Qaeda, Rhodes said . ""The president does not view these negotiations as having a goal of keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""And we're guided by the shared missions that we've agreed to with the Afghans, the training and equipping of their forces, and counterterrorism."" But the United States also is insistent on legal protection for any troops in Afghanistan after 2014. If there is no agreement on that between the United States and Karzai between now and the end of 2014, then it could lead to a similar situation for the United States as when it left Iraq. The refusal by the Iraqi government to extend legal protections for U.S. troops after the end of the war in Iraq was a major reason the United States left the country with no residual military training force. But Karzai has said he would like for U.S. troops to remain after the end of the NATO mission. He also has been highly critical of the troops over the years, following incidents in which U.S. forces have killed civilians. Attack takes life of British soldier . U.S. defense officials are playing a wait-and-see game on what the Karzai visit will produce.

"(CNN) -- By announcing that he will release no further tax returns beyond his 2010 and 2011 returns, Mitt Romney appears to have exempted himself from the proud bipartisan tradition of presidential nominees displaying genuine financial candor with the electorate. What is more, his disclosure to date is in the wrong direction: It is the release of Romney's past returns, not his current ones, that matters. Since George Romney inaugurated the practice more than 40 years ago by releasing 12 years of tax returns in his bid for the Republican Party nomination, presidential nominees have been transparent with voters about their personal finances. For this reason, we have not suffered a significant tax scandal involving a nominee or sitting president since President Richard Nixon's abuse of the tax code. Either Romney has an unresolved father figure issue, or he has some special reason not to follow a tradition established by his father. News: Romney campaign expected to launch multipronged effort to rebut attacks . Given Romney's financial sophistication, it has been assumed by some that there cannot be any tax skeletons in his closet. His reluctance to disclose past returns, however, undermines that assumption. We are left with the difficult task of plausibly reconstructing his financial record based on the one full return that he has released. The result is troubling. Mitt Romney is extraordinarily wealthy, but that is not a justification for nondisclosure. He has made no secret of his wealth, and required campaign disclosures already hint at its magnitude. While Romney may have dissembled about when he actually left Bain Capital, he has been disassociated with the firm long enough that he cannot argue that his tax returns will reveal proprietary secrets. Nor is this just an exercise in financial titillation or gossip. Disclosure goes to the heart of the truthfulness with which a nominee engages the American people, and it assures us that he in fact has comported himself before the election with the high moral character we associate with a future president. Romney's 2010 tax return, when combined with his FEC disclosure, reveals red flags that raise serious tax compliance questions with respect to his possible tax minimization strategies in earlier years. The release in October of his 2011 return will at best act as a distraction from these questions. So, what are the issues? The first is Romney's Swiss bank account. Most presidential candidates don't think it appropriate to bet that the U.S. dollar will lose value by speculating in Swiss Francs, which is basically the rationale offered by the trustee of Romney's ""blind"" trust for opening this account. What's more, if you really want just to speculate on foreign currencies, you don't need a Swiss bank account to do so. The Swiss bank account raises tax compliance questions, too. News: Americans view Romney's campaign more unfavorably than Obama's . The account seems to have been closed early in 2010, but was the income in fact reported on earlier tax returns? Did the Romneys timely file the required disclosure forms to the Treasury Department (so-called FBAR reports)? The IRS announced in 2009 a partial tax amnesty for unreported foreign bank accounts, in light of the Justice Department's criminal investigations involving several Swiss banks. To date, some 34,500 Americans have taken advantage of such amnesty programs. Did the Romneys avail themselves of any of these amnesty programs? One hopes that such a suggestion is preposterous, but that is what disclosure is for -- to replace speculation with truth-telling to the American people. Second, Romney's $100 million IRA is remarkable in its size. Even under the most generous assumptions, Romney would have been restricted to annual contributions of $30,000 while he worked at Bain. How does this grow to $100 million? One possibility is that a truly mighty oak sprang up virtually overnight from relatively tiny annual acorns because of the unprecedented prescience of every one of Romney's investment choices. Another, which on its face is quite plausible, is that Romney stuffed far more into his retirement plans each year than the maximum allowed by law by claiming that the stock of the Bain company deals that the retirement plan acquired had only a nominal value. He presumably would have done so by relying on a special IRS ""safe harbor"" rule relating to the taxation of a service partner's receipt of such interests, but that rule emphatically does not apply to an interest when sold to a retirement plan, which is supposed to be measured by its true fair market value. Third, the vast amounts in Romney's family trusts raise a parallel question: Did Romney report and pay gift tax on the funding of these trusts or did he claim similarly unreasonable valuations, which likewise would have exposed him to serious penalties if all the facts were known? Fourth, the complexity of Romney's one publicly released tax return, with all its foreign accounts, trusts, corporations and partnerships, leaves even experts (including us) scratching their heads. Disclosure of multiple years' tax returns is part of the answer here, but in this case it isn't sufficient. Romney's financial affairs are so arcane, so opaque and so tied up in his continuing income from Bain Capital that more is needed, including an explanation of the $100 million IRA. Finally, there's the puzzle of the Romneys' extraordinarily low effective tax rate. For 2010, the Romneys enjoyed a federal tax rate of only 13.9% on their adjusted gross income of roughly $22 million, which gave them a lower federal tax burden (including payroll, income and excise taxes) than the average American wage-earning family in the $40,000 to $50,000 range. The principal reason for this munificently low tax rate is that much of Romney's income, even today, comes from ""carried interest,"" which is just the jargon used by the private equity industry for compensation received for managing other people's money. The vast majority of tax scholars and policy experts agree that awarding a super-low tax rate to this one form of labor income is completely unjustified as a policy matter. Romney has not explained how, as president, he can bring objectivity to bear on this tax loophole that is estimated as costing all of us billions of dollars every year. News: Romney cites incident of helping campaign contributor . The U.S. presidency is a position of immense magnitude and requires a thorough vetting. What the American people deserve is a complete and honest presentation by Romney of how his wealth was accumulated, where it is now invested, what purpose is served by all the various offshore vehicles in which he has an interest and what his financial relationship with Bain Capital has been since his retirement from the company. These are all factors that go to the heart of his character and values. For a nominee to America's highest office, a clear and transparent reporting of his finances should be nothing more than routine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward D. Kleinbard and Peter C. Canellos.","Mitt Romney has only released one complete tax return for 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Ariel Castro's ex-daughter-in-law never felt comfortable around the man who police say kept three young women trapped in a Cleveland home for a decade. Monica Stephens -- who was once married to Castro's son Anthony -- said she never developed a close relationship with Castro, primarily because of the stories her ex-husband and ex-mother-in-law had shared with her. ""I never had the desire to get to know him personally or very closely,"" Stephens told CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night. ""Both my ex-husband and his mother had shared with me stories of how he had beaten them, locked them in the house, just treated them like hostages, so I never had a desire to get to know him. He didn't have that like, you know, father-in-law appeal."" Photographs give glimpse of Castro's yard . Stephens said she had been told Castro's alleged abuse of Anthony Castro began when he was a child and that he even beat his wife, Grimilda Figueroa, after she had brain surgery. ""He still continued to beat her. He hit her in the head. Either he kicked her or hit her with a lead pipe,"" she said. ""I don't even think I really fully could grasp just how horrible some of the stories were."" In addition to the beatings, Castro ""played a lot of mind games"" with the family members, Stephens said she was told. Court documents show that Castro was in fact accused in 2005 of repeated abuse and domestic violence against Figueroa. The allegations include a broken nose, broken ribs and threats to kill her. But after several missed court appearances by Castro and repeated court delays, the petition was dismissed. Lawyers for Castro told CNN affiliate WKYC that their client is being wrongly depicted by many. ""The initial portrayal by the media has been one of a 'monster' and that's not the impression that I got when I talked to him for three hours,"" attorney Craig Weintraub told WKYC. Another Castro attorney, Jaye Schlachet, added: ""I know the media wants to jump to conclusions and all the people in the community want to say terrible things about the person who's accused. We are not even at the beginning of the process. If this was a marathon race, we're not even at the starting line yet."" During her marriage, Stephens made a visit with Anthony Castro to Ariel Castro's home. Stories she heard about how he would ""obsessively"" keep things locked up in the house made her nervous during her short visit. Castro's brothers: Ariel fooled us . ""I don't think we were there more than 20 minutes. It wasn't a normal occurrence. I think that was the one and only time I had ever been there. Ariel Castro always gave me the heebie-jeebies, but I thought that was just because of my personal bias,"" she said. ""Like I said, I just attribute to the things I had heard about him."" Stephens said she didn't hear any unusual noises when she was in the house. The three women once held captive in that house -- Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight -- have said in a statement from their attorney they want privacy so they can reconnect with their families. They also won't be giving any media interviews until after the criminal case against Castro is complete. Castro's daughter crushed by news her father allegedly abducted her friend . Berry and DeJesus returned to joyous homecomings with their families last week. The whereabouts of Knight are unknown. She has not reunited with her family, but a source close to the investigation told CNN she ""is in a safe place and very comfortable."" Castro, a 52-year-old bus driver and musician, faces charges of rape and kidnapping in connection with the prolonged captivity of the women. According to initial police reports, the women told investigators that they were chained in the basement of the home, but later moved upstairs to rooms on the second floor. They were allowed out of the home only twice, and then just briefly, according to the document. How the horror unfolded . Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- Alexis Sanchez sealed Barcelona's victory in last weekend's El Clasico with an impudent goal and Friday gave them a hard won victory over Espanyol in the Catalan derby. Sanchez struck in the 68th minute to break the deadlock in the Camp Nou and the 1-0 victory was Barca's 11th win out of 12 in La Liga. He tapped in from close range after Brazilian star Neymar threaded a ball through the legs of two defenders to find his teammate, who netted his seventh league goal in the last nine games. It was one of few clear cut chances for the reigning champions against obdurate opponents who occasionally offered a threat in attack. The visitors had the best chance of the first half when Victor Sanchez was sent through and his goalward bound effort was only denied by the flailing leg of Victor Valdes in the home goal. Summer signing Neymar nearly opened the scoring midway through the second half when his curling shot went just wide but ever a threat, his assist on the goal proved the crucial moment. By contrast, Lionel Messi had another quiet game by his standards and has now gone four straight without scoring. Even with this comparative drought, Barcelona have forged four points clear of Atletico Madrid, who have a game in hand, and nine in front of Real Madrid, beaten 2-0 last Saturday. All three table toppers enjoyed midweek wins in a hectic period in the Spanish championship, with Atletico and Real looking to close the gap on the leaders in their 12th round matches this weekend. In the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund took over at the head of affairs from Bayern Munich after a thumping 6-1 beating of VfB Stuttgart Friday night. Stuttgart had been unbeaten in seven league matches and took the lead through Tunisian defender Karim Haggui. But their joy was to prove short lived as Greek international Sokratis Papastathopoulos drew Dortmund level before Marco Reus's 22nd minute effort put them ahead. Polish scoring machine Robert Lewandowski hit a second half hat-trick with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang adding the other. It left Juergen Klopp's men two points clear of champions Bayern, who play at Hoffenheim Saturday. Reigning French Ligue 1 champion Paris Saint Germain stretched their unbeaten run in the league to 23 games with a 4-0 defeat of Lorient. Goals from Lucas, Jeremy Menez and two from Edison Cavani left Laurent Blanc's men three points clear of Monaco, who play at Lille Sunday.","Barcelona beat Espanyol in Catalan derby .

"(MNN.com) -- On any given Saturday, you'll find a motley crew assembled outside the nondescript gray building on Hollywood Road, west of downtown Atlanta. An elderly couple walks tentatively behind a large black Labrador, a kid with chubby cheeks totes a feisty Chihuahua, and a trio of teens bound out of their parent's minivan with a brindle pit bull named Kola in tow. They join at least a dozen other pet owners for free obedience classes offered by the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) through its Pets for Life program. Designed to support people and pets in underserved communities, Pets for Life welcomes all breeds. But an overwhelming majority of the four-legged students that arrive each week are pit bulls or pit mixes. On busy days, cars slow their pace and kids peer through the chain link fence to watch these muscular dogs work for treats alongside cocker spaniels, Jack Russell terriers, and even an occasional poodle. The six-week training program ends with dogs taking the Canine Good Citizen test, followed by a graduation party where neighbors gather to watch students demonstrate new tricks. In less than a year, HSUS has begun to chip away at the city's perception of pit bulls as dog-fighting monsters. But the D.C.-based organization faces a bigger battle in its own backyard. Maryland's Court of Appeals ruled in August that pit bulls are ""inherently dangerous."" The decision stems from a case involving a pit bull named Clifford that escaped from its pen twice, severely injuring two children on the same day. Plaintiffs sued the dog's owner and the landlord. Maryland's Court of Appeals ruling means that dog owners — and their landlords — are responsible for any injuries caused by pit bulls. (The ruling was a slight modification of an earlier decision that included pit bull mixes.) Pit bull owners, rescue groups and nonprofit organizations have criticized the ruling, which places breed-specific legislation back in the spotlight. Last December, retired police officer Jim Sak and his pit bull service dog made headlines by challenging a breed ban in Aurelia, Iowa. According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, any breed can work as a service dog. The U.S. District Court in Sioux City granted a temporary injunction, reuniting Snickers and Sak, who credits his pit bull with detecting early signs of cancer. In July, the Aurelia City Council allowed Sak to keep his dog. In the meantime, Maryland pit bull owners — and their landlords — face tough choices. The Baltimore Sun reports of early fallout from the ruling, including landlords threatening pit bull owners with eviction. HSUS has responded with advice to renters who own pit bulls, along with links to pet-friendly rental properties on its website. MNN: Maryland court declares pit bulls 'inherently dangerous' Wanted, pit-friendly housing . Erin Sullivan regularly leases her Maryland property to pet owners, including pit bulls. She requires pets to be spayed or neutered and tenants must sign a lease addendum promising never to leave the dog outside unattended. Dogs also should be up to date on vaccinations, and a Canine Good Citizenship Certification certainly helps. Although she lives and works as an editor in Orlando, Florida, Sullivan makes frequent visits to Maryland. Even with these precautions, she was alarmed by the court ruling. ""I don't think pit bull owners should be locked out of the rental market,"" says Sullivan, who has two pit bulls and one pit mix. ""I don't believe a pit bull as a breed is any more dangerous. I will judge each dog as an individual. If a person comes with a small white mutt and I think they won't be responsible, they aren't getting in."" The American Society for the Prevention Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) also opposes Maryland's ruling. Its newly established legal advocacy department will target civil and criminal cases that could substantially impact animal welfare, providing support to attorneys and drafting bills for its government relations department, which will monitor legislation based on the recent court ruling. ""It will have a really devastating impact on folks in Maryland,"" says Stacy Wolf, vice president and chief counsel of the legal advocacy department. ""It's bad in a whole lot of ways, but maybe most importantly, it doesn't do a lot to protect people from dogs of all breeds, it doesn't put the onus on owners and it judges the dog."" She adds that dogs of any breed, even if friendly, can cause trouble if not properly supervised. MNN: Pit bull takes hit from train to save her owner . How did we get here? Every decade, a different breed gets labeled as the problem pooch, says dog trainer and police officer Mike Upshur. In the '70s, he remembers Dobermans getting a bad rap, followed by German shepherds in the '80s and powerful Rottweilers in the '90s. The American Kennel Club describes each breed as a protective and loyal family pet that requires lots of exercise. Its description of pit bulls, also known as American Staffordshire terriers, is no different. ""The Am Staff is a people-oriented dog that thrives when he is made part of the family and given a job to do,"" according to the AKC site. ""Although friendly, this breed is loyal to his family and will protect them from any threat. His short coat is low-maintenance, but regular exercise and training is necessary."" Originally bred for bull baiting in England, pit bulls gained favor stateside for their athletic build and extreme tenacity, traits that made pit bulls the breed of choice among dog fighters, says Upshur. A series of high-profile dog-fighting cases led to stricter penalties for people who attend or participate in dog fighting. Incidents of pit bulls or pit mixes attacking people also led to increased media coverage. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 4.7 million dog bites occur each year, and 800,000 Americans seek medical attention for their injuries. In its 20-year study of fatal dog attacks, the CDC noted that at least 25 breeds of dogs have been involved in 238 human dog-bite related fatalities between 1979 and 1998, with pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers linked to more than half of these deaths. But Upshur says many people gravitated to pit bulls without doing the research — or taking time to exercise and socialize this powerful breed on a regular basis. In his role as a police officer, Upshur has witnessed the aftermath of dog attacks. Many of the cases involved unsocialized dogs that broke free from chains in the back yard. Thirty-three people lost their lives in dog bite-related incidents in 2010, according to the National Canine Research Council, which reports that 21 of the cases involved resident dogs that owners kept isolated on chains, in junkyards, or allowed their dogs to roam unattended. ""I see it all the time while I'm on patrol,"" Upshur says. ""It's a shame, it really is. But there are other dogs out there attacking people. They just don't get publicity."" MNN: 7 of the most loyal dogs . Changing perceptions . Upshur recommends that pit bull owners enroll in training courses and walk their dogs regularly, at least three times a week, to help the dog burn energy and avoid destructive behavior. He says the breed can be easy to train because pit bulls love pleasing their owners. ""Unfortunately, people are not doing that, and it's given pit bulls a bad name,"" he says. ""They look at the color and say 'I want that one,'"" he says. ""People get a willful pit bull or a pit bull puppy and don't have time to work with it, then the dog gets bored. If you don't have time to spend with a dog, you don't want a pit bull. A lot of people just put the dog in a fenced-in yard and say the dog gets plenty of exercise, but the dog needs to stimulate its mind just like people do."" As founder and president of the Atlanta Underdog Initiative, Ami Ciontos carefully vets prospective dog owners before adopting out pit bulls. She offers plenty of information about the breed, along with a laundry list of dos and don'ts. ""I want to make sure that whomever I adopt to is educated about the breed,"" she says. ""We want to make sure they understand the stigma about the breed and that they are held to a higher standard. I tell people right off the bat, if you want a dog park type dog, a dog you can just run off-leash, please do not get a pit bull."" Upshur says pit bull owners can change how the breed is perceived. Consistent obedience training helps ensure that willful puppies don't turn into domineering older dogs. Education about the breed also can make a difference for the dog and the owner. ""When you bring a dog into your life, you're making a connection with that animal and it does become a part of your family,"" says Sullivan, who will continue leasing her Maryland home to pit bull owners. ""As a landlord, I feel even more responsible than if I lived in the house. I tend to be maybe a little more diligent. As a pit bull owner, I have to go above and beyond to show that I am responsible. I don't ever want my neighbors, my friends, my family to think, 'Here comes Erin again with her dogs.'""

"(CNN) -- Take a pair of hi-fi speakers, an old radio, a couple of DVD players and countless other household appliances, apply some ingenuity and what do you get? If you're Mark Haygood, an ex-cop turned robot maker, you get HEX -- a four foot, three-inch tall humanoid robot. ""Frankly, I think of it as a very large toy. I think that mindset helped me get the build done, because it's such a daunting task,"" said Haygood. Four years in the making, it's been as much art project as engineering feat, he says, requiring the visualization of the various body parts. ""The legs are made from outdoor speakers -- they're gorgeous. His shoulders are made from fans, his forearms from power tools. The chest and back are made from kid's riding toys and his head is a clock radio. I also employed a 3-D printer for the hands, using a combination of the Inmoov open-source design and my own artistic expression,"" the 49-year-old from Baltimore explains. ""There are so many diverse parts on the machine that it would take me all day to tell you. It was a really complex build, but I love this machine and I'm anxious to build another."" The self-taught roboticist has drawn inspiration from Honda's ASIMO robot and Drexel University's HUBO as well as sounding out opinion at his local hackerspace. Assembling HEX has cost the proverbial arm and a leg -- ""tens of thousands of dollars,"" says Haygood -- and is controlled remotely using a Zigbee USB dongle attached to his laptop. ""He can step unsupported, but it's not completely stable -- I have a slight problem with joint compliance at the moment. But his hands are fully functional, his legs are functional and he has 23 degrees of freedom."" It's all a far cry from Haygood's previous life as a police officer -- serving the Baltimore Police Department for over two decades before retiring in 2006. ""I really enjoyed being a cop ... I wanted to go out and lock up the bad guys and that's what I did. But policing completely takes over your life. That's one of the reasons I got out,"" he says. The death of his father three years later prompted Haygood to re-evaluate his life and in looking for a new path he turned back to an old passion. ""I grew up very poor in Baltimore and every Christmas my mother used to purchase toy robots for me -- the kind that shuffled across the floor, spun around with lights flashing. I thought they were the most marvelous things on the planet."" Not content playing with them, Haygood would pull them apart and put them back together in differing configurations. It helped numb the pain of poverty, he says, while also keeping him out of trouble -- a trick he's hoping to pull off for a new generation of kids. Haygood has already introduced HEX to the robotics club at Baltimore's Dunbar High School and plans future visits to other schools and clubs in the city. ""Because of the crime problems in Baltimore, it's a perfect opportunity to try and snatch some children back from the abyss. That's my objective. It's a really beautiful thing to be able to introduce robotics to kids."" To help spread the message, and the cost, Haygood is launching a Kickstarter campaign. The money raised will be used to iron out flaws as well as document the entire process -- ""so anyone can see every nut, bolt and screw,"" he says. ""It's full speed ahead for me now. This was trial by fire. I chose the most difficult thing a person could build and I've learned so much that my brain is just brimming now and ready to go. I'm excited for the future.""","Ex-cop builds a humanoid robot called HEX made from electrical appliances .

"(CNN) -- The Newtown, Connecticut, police chief has withdrawn a recommendation to fire an officer diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and haunted by the horrific images of the mass shooting at an elementary school there. In a December 5 letter to the Newtown Board of Police Commissioners, Police Chief Michael Kehoe said he was withdrawing an earlier ""request and recommendation"" that Officer Thomas Bean be fired. Bean was one of the first officers to respond to the December 2012 shooting that left 26 dead, including 20 children. He told CNN that continues to have flashbacks and is left crying some nights by memories of the bloodshed. ""Nothing could prepare you for that,"" Bean, a 12-year veteran, recently told CNN's Susan Candiotti. ""The worst possible scenes you could think of ... because all there was, was horror."" Bean was diagnosed with PTSD and has not been able to return to work. Six months after the mass shooting, the officer -- who responded to the tragedy on his day off -- was placed on long-term disability, according to Bean and his union. ""That day killed me inside,"" he said. Training the brain to stress less . A letter from the police department, obtained by CNN, confirmed that he was ""permanently disabled"" and could be fired. Bean and his union representative said Newtown could afford to pay only two years of long-term disability. Bean said he has a dozen years left on the job before being able to retire and believes his benefits should continue through his normal retirement date. But the town has refused to arbitrate the issue, Bean said. ""The town no longer intends to fire me,"" he said. ""Instead they have decided to let my long-term disability benefits expire in a year and then move on. I am sorry that I can no longer be a police officer, but I cannot change what happened that day or how it has affected me."" Bean and his union representative intend to file a lawsuit by the end of the month, he said. ""The town agreed with the union that no one would suffer financially from this, but they lied because they are hell-bent on ruining my life through financial burdens, not allowing me the right to work elsewhere and the continuous retraumatization of myself and my family,"" Bean said. Bean recently told CNN that he broke down in tears after Sandy Hook Elementary School was cleared. He drank and smoked excessively. He even contemplated cutting himself with a razor. ""I didn't want to kill myself but I wanted to feel something,"" he said. ""Had no feeling, no sensation, no nothing."" Adam Lanza, 20, shot and killed 20 young children and six teachers in the school before taking his own life -- a massacre that prompted a national debate over tougher gun laws. Bean said he knew he was in ""deep, deep trouble"" after entering a store one day. ""I looked at everyone in that store like they was going to kill me,"" he said. ""I could not get out of that store fast enough. I looked around, and there was a crowd of people, and all I saw were flashbacks -- (the) firehouse with the families or what I saw that day."" Bean, 38 and married with two children, remains in therapy. He said he is grateful for support from one group in particular, Save a Warrior. Bean urges others suffering from PTSD to seek help. ""The Save A Warrior program that I went through is free,"" he said. ""We even had some law enforcement from LAPD and NYPD go through the program."" Other Newtown police officers were diagnosed with PTSD, but Bean was the only one unable to return to work, union officials said. ""If I had my arm chopped off, they'd would say, 'Oh yeah, he's hurt.' But instead they're like, 'We can sweep (this) under the rug and not necessarily have to pay because ... it's not physically seen.' That's the problem with PTSD ... people don't see it,"" said Bean, his voice trailing off.","Newtown police chief withdraws recommendation to fire veteran officer with PTSD .

"New York (CNN) -- Some athletes strive to conquer mountains, but Andrea De Mello started with a much more humble goal: a lamppost. She had suffered a stroke in 1980 at age 10 and spent the majority of the next few years in a hospital bed or wheelchair. She eventually moved from her native Brazil to New York for treatment, and a family friend urged her to get in touch with Dick Traum, who had started a running club for disabled athletes. When she met the group in Central Park one Saturday morning in 1986, Traum urged her to take steps that would ultimately change her life. ""Dick said to walk one lamppost to another lamppost,"" she recalled. ""I walked very slowly. ... It was very hard."" That day, De Mello walked the distance between six lampposts -- about 300 yards. The next week, she walked eight lampposts. Every week, she improved, and by the next year, she finished the New York City Marathon. ""I felt great because I did something to help myself,"" said De Mello, 42. ""I started my life again."" There are many stories like De Mello's at Achilles International, the nonprofit Traum started almost 30 years ago. Today, the organization provides free athletic training, support and a sense of community to more than 10,000 disabled athletes in 70 countries worldwide. The idea is relatively simple. At weekly runs, able-bodied volunteers are matched with disabled runners who have a variety of physical and mental challenges. ""Amputees, strokes, autism, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy -- you probably can't think of a disability that's not represented,"" Traum said. Running side by side, the athletes get in shape, build confidence and make friends. It's an atmosphere that Traum, 71, still loves. An above-the-knee amputee, he can still be found in Central Park every Saturday morning, making people laugh -- and groan -- with his notoriously bad jokes. ""Camaraderie is the most important part of what we do,"" Traum said. ""We make it into a fun thing, so that it's not only a matter of how fast or how far can I run, but it's about sharing the run with the group."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Many of the disabled athletes are training to achieve specific goals, whether it's a 5-kilometer race or the New York City Marathon. Traum believes that when they compete in mainstream races, they change opinions on two levels. ""When an able-bodied runner gets passed by someone on one leg, it changes their perception of what the disabled can do,"" Traum said. ""It also changes the way disabled athletes perceive themselves."" It's a circle of inspiration that's been growing since Traum started his work. A lifelong New Yorker, Traum was always athletic, even wrestling at the college level. But as a 24-year-old doctoral student, he was in a car accident and eventually had one leg amputated. ""Somehow, I wasn't upset,"" he said. ""When you lose a leg, there's no ambiguity. ... You get an artificial leg and keep going."" He went on to start a successful business, but the long hours spent at work took their toll. When a friend died of a heart attack in 1975, he realized he needed to get in shape. He joined the local YMCA and started running. At first, he could run only a few hundred feet. But he slowly built up to a mile and then five miles. Running on his prosthetic leg, he was an unusual sight. ""I'd ask my coach how I was doing compared to the other amputees, and he'd say 'About the same,' "" Traum remembered. ""The joke was, there were no other amputee runners. ""I had more than a few kids ask me if I was a bionic man,"" he said. In 1976, Traum became the first amputee to run the New York City Marathon, finishing in seven hours and 24 minutes. To Traum's knowledge, he is the first person to run such a distance on a prosthetic leg. Traum's achievement inspired Terry Fox, a Canadian teenager who had lost a leg to cancer. Fox decided to run across Canada, averaging a marathon distance of 26 miles a day, to raise money for cancer research. He named his crusade the Marathon of Hope, and he ran more than 3,300 miles, raising millions of dollars and international awareness before cancer finally took his life in 1981. Traum never met Fox. But it was after he went to Canada to compete in a race held in Fox's honor that he got the idea to start Achilles International, which he named in honor of the Greek warrior who was perfect except for one vulnerability. The group, which gets its funding from corporate and foundation grants, has no membership fee, and it will often pay race entry fees for people who can't afford them. Traum has never wanted anything to prevent athletes from participating. ""Running that first marathon was probably the favorite day in my life,"" Traum said. ""I'm just trying to give that joy to others."" Opinion: Oscar Pistorius, an inspiration and a question . Although running has always been the group's primary focus, in recent years, Achilles has started offering hand-crank wheelchairs, tandem biking, triathlon training and kayaking. After knee replacement surgery a few years ago, Traum stopped running himself and switched to a hand-crank wheelchair, which is low, has three wheels and is moved by the user's arms. Achilles has also developed a number of specialized programs like Achilles Kids, which works with more than 4,000 disabled children, and the Freedom Team of Wounded Veterans, which has helped more than 1,000 disabled veterans finish marathons across the country. Army Capt. David Rozelle had his foot amputated in 2003 after his Humvee hit a land mine in Iraq. He started training with Achilles at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, and just 10 months after his injury, he ran the New York City Marathon. At his request, he was deemed fit for duty, and in 2005, he rejoined his unit in Iraq, becoming the first amputee to return to war. Rozelle's story makes Traum glow with pride. ""We are literally addicting people to achievement,"" Traum said. ""They feel good about themselves, and their level of aspiration increases dramatically. "" Since walking to that first lamppost, De Mello has gone on to compete in 20 New York City Marathons and five Paralympic Games, competing in swimming and wheelchair fencing. It's a life that she says she could never have dreamed of without Traum. ""He (became) my friend, my family, my coach and my hero,"" she said. ""Dick helped me realize that everything is possible in my life."" Traum's influence can also be found every day in neighborhoods across the country. ""Now, you see (disabled athletes) running in the park all the time,"" Traum said. ""It's just like a seed that we've successfully planted."" Want to get involved?

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Hoopla surrounding South by Southwest Interactive, the techie festival that wrapped up here Tuesday, has exploded in recent years. The event is famously known for helping to boost Twitter in 2007 and Foursquare three years later, giving it a rep as a launching pad for new digital tools. Fresh-faced startups converge on Austin, hoping to get venture capital and buzz. It's one of the reasons attendance at SXSWi this week swelled to an all-time high of 30,621, up some 25% from last year. It also has created big expectations. One of the most commonly asked questions among attendees here is, ""What's the coolest new thing you've seen?"" ""That hype has been good for growth. But it's also proved to be a double-edged sword,"" said Hugh Forrest, director of the festival, in an interview here Tuesday. ""People expect something to launch here Friday and be as big as Facebook by Sunday. There are things here that may not hit the mainstream for a couple of years, because they're not fully developed."" SXSW has gotten so big and diffuse that trends can be hard to quantify. But if you go to enough panels and talk to enough people, some themes start to emerge. Here are five takeaways from the past five days: . Hardware, not software . As digital tech went social and mobile, recent years at SXSWi have been all about social apps. Two years ago the buzzword was group messaging; last year it was ""social discovery"" apps such as Highlight, which let you know when people who share your interests are nearby. But this week, SXSW has been acting a little more like CES, the annual electronics gadget show. MakerBot, which makes desktop 3-D printers, made headlines by unveiling a device that scans small three-dimensional objects so they can be replicated in a printer. Also getting buzz was the tiny Memoto ""life blogging"" camera, which clips to a shirt or jacket and snaps a picture every 30 seconds; and the Leap Motion Controller, which plugs into a computer and lets users interact with the machine by waving their hand. ""We've had a much more hardware and gadget focus than we've had before,"" said Forrest, who thinks the new wave of gadgets may catch on because of their simplicity of use. Much of the talk at SXSWi was about uses for a gadget that wasn't even officially shown here: Google Glass, the Internet-connected eyewear that Google expects to roll out later this year. Yes, 3-D printing is a thing . MakerBot wasn't the only company in Austin that makes 3-D printers, which can produce objects from computer models by layering thin sheets of molten plastic. 3D Systems was here with their Cube home 3-D printer, which they marketed by having a man walk around Austin wearing it around his neck. Several SXSW panels also explored the promising future of 3-D printing, expected to be a hot tech trend in coming years. ""I think the 3-D printing stuff is still a little too complicated for most of us,"" Forrest said. ""But the next generation of this technology will be simpler to use. That's always the key here: The SXSW crowd is full of first adopters, but can your mom use it?"" Space, the next entrepreneurial frontier . With the shuttering of NASA's space shuttle program, many feared the exploration of outer space would wane with it. Instead, innovators have leaped into action, sometimes aiming even higher than government agencies have (at least publicly) dared. That enthusiasm was on ample display at South by Southwest this week. At least 15 panels focused on private space travel during the festival. Entrepreneurs proposed everything from a Mars fly-by that would launch in 2018 to building new, privately owned modules on the International Space Station. Someone even proposed a multibillion-dollar reality show following prospective astronauts training for a one-way mission to Mars. Elon Musk, the CEO of private company SpaceX, hosted one of the most popular keynotes of the week. He detailed his company's recent mission to the International Space Station and showed a never-before-seen video of a reusable rocket designed to one day blast capsules into space and then safely land itself. He said he wants to see humans on Mars. In his lifetime. Preferably him. ""I would like to die on Mars,"" he joked. ""Just not on impact."" Big, large, enormous data . Stephen Wolfram, the scientist behind the data-driven Wolfram Alpha computational search engine, told a SXSW audience that ""In the modern world, everyone should learn data science,"" or mining large databases for useful patterns of information. Nate Silver, The New York Times data guru who got a flood of press when he correctly predicted results in all 50 states during last fall's presidential election, hosted a keynote in which he said data-crunching could have useful applications in the public sector, such as studying incarceration data to reform the prison system. Most government agencies collect reams of data but it gets ignored because of bureaucracy, said Silver. ""But we should understand that it's hard to take this big data and turn it into progress,"" he said, no doubt splashing cold water on the many startups seeking to scour databases, such as Twitter stats, for lucrative products. On the flip side, a Carnegie Mellon professor showed how combining online data with facial-recognition software could reveal a surprisingly detailed dossier on a person, including an educated guess about their Social Security number. More celebrities (human ones, too)! When compared to its glitzier siblings, the SXSW film and music festivals, South by Southwest Interactive has until recently been low in celebrity wattage. Let's face it, tech geeks don't walk the red carpet much. But as more famous people embrace technology -- everyone wants to look smart -- SXSW is attracting bigger names with only tangential connections to the tech industry. This year's event featured talks by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, former vice president Al Gore, Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker and hoops star Shaquille O'Neal. This trend is not an accident. ""There are a lot of people here, and it makes it easier (on us) if you can get someone like a Rachel Maddow who can fill a big room,"" Forrest said. However, the biggest celebrity at SXSW 2013 wasn't even part of the official programming: Viral Web star Grumpy Cat, who posed for photos in the Mashable House and drew lines of fans around the block. That just goes to prove: You can launch the cleverest app in the world, but cats still rule the Internet.","The South by Southwest Interactive festival wrapped up Tuesday after five days .

"(CNN) -- Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief and political contender Dominique Strauss-Kahn has seen his reputation tarnished in a turbulent 12 months. He was once most known for his brilliant grasp of global economics and European politics. Now, his name is connected with an accusation of sexual assault from a hotel maid in New York and an investigation into gang rape and ""aggravated pimping"" in France by prosecutors who allege he participated in a prostitution ring. Just last year, Dominique Gaston Andre Strauss-Kahn was head of the powerful IMF and the presumptive front-runner for the presidency of France. But when a hotel employee accused him of assaulting her in Manhattan's Sofitel Hotel last May his professional life disintegrated. Despite denying the charges, he stepped down from the IMF and his dream of leading France's Socialist Party in this year's presidential election vanished. However, the criminal case against him fell apart before it reached a courtroom when New York prosecutors cited credibility issues with the maid's story. Strauss-Kahn still faces a civil suit in the case. It was, by any standard, a stunning fall for the man many presumed would be the new occupant of the Elysee Palace instead of Francois Hollande. It was also a cautionary tale for those who might forget how quickly sexual allegations can bring down even the most influential leaders. Long before he ended up on the front pages of the tabloids, Strauss-Kahn was well known to followers of global financial news. The University of Paris-educated economist headed the IMF for the duration of the global financial crisis. In doing so, he played a lead role in arranging bailouts for Greece and Ireland, as well as propping up Europe's single currency, the euro. The IMF, which, among other things, assists countries suffering economic difficulties by providing loans, was founded near the end of World War II and is now made up of 187 countries. Strauss-Kahn was a force in French politics for a quarter-century, first winning election to that country's National Assembly -- the lower house of parliament -- in 1986. He was President Francois Mitterrand's trade minister from 1991 to 1993, and went on to serve as finance minister in the late 1990s. During that period, Paris joined the euro and ditched the franc. In 1999, after an allegation of unethical financial doings involving his consulting business, Strauss-Kahn resigned his ministerial post. He was later acquitted of the charges. Strauss-Kahn lost a fight with Segolene Royal for the Socialist Party's presidential nomination in 2006. One year later, he was named managing director of the IMF. Married to his third wife and the father of four children, he has also taught economics at Stanford University in California and at the prestigious Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris, known as Sciences Po. A dominant figure on the French left, Strauss-Kahn also gained a reputation over the years as someone who enjoys a lavish lifestyle -- critics have made much of his image as a ""champagne socialist."" As head of the IMF, Strauss-Kahn pulled in an annual tax-free salary of more than $420,000, according to a 2007 statement from the organization. He also received more than $75,000 for ""a scale of living appropriate"" to his position. To the extent that there was a perceived conflict between his socialist political ideals and wealthy lifestyle, it wasn't an issue for most French voters, said Simon Serfaty, a senior European analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Similarly, French voters typically take little notice of allegations of infidelility, which are much less likely to derail a political career in France than in America -- though in Strauss-Kahn's case, the sheer volume of accusations seems to have stymied his ambitions, especially with the election this month of Hollande as French president. Strauss-Kahn became embroiled in sexual controversy soon after joining the IMF in 2007: In 2008, he was reprimanded for having a relationship with a female employee. An independent inquiry found the relationship was consensual, and the IMF's executive board concluded that ""there was no harassment, favoritism or any other abuse of authority by the managing director,"" but it found that ""the incident was regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment."" Strauss-Kahn issued a statement after the investigation, noting that he had ""apologized for it to the (board of directors), to the staff of the IMF and to my family,"" as well as to the employee. In the months following the Sofitel Hotel accusation last year, other allegations surfaced. Anne Mansouret, a Socialist member of the French parliament, said Strauss-Kahn had attacked her daughter. Mansouret said she had cautioned her daughter, Tristane Banon, not to file a police report at the time, saying it might adversely impact her career. Last year, Banon did file a complaint, alleging a 2002 attack, though it could not be pursued because the statute of limitations had expired. Strauss-Kahn denied the allegations and has since filed a counter-suit in France, alleging slander. CNN does not typically name assault victims, but Mansouret said her daughter gave permission for her name to be disclosed. Now Strauss-Kahn faces another legal battle -- this time the case centers on an investigation into a high-profile prostitution network operating out of luxury hotels in the French city of Lille. In May police French prosecutors have widened the investigation, opening a preliminary inquiry into acts that allegedly took place in Washington, which they believe could constitute gang rape. CNN has yet to hear from Strauss-Kahn's lawyers about the allegations. When the pimping claims surfaced, in November last year, Strauss-Kahn's attorneys condemned the allegations as ""unhealthy, sensationalist and not without a political agenda."" His lawyer, Henri Leclerc, acknowledged in an interview with radio station Europe1 that Strauss-Kahn attended sex parties, but says his client was unaware that the women involved were prostitutes. Strauss-Kahn is not allowed to have contact with other people involved in the investigation, nor is he permitted to talk to the media about the case.","Dominique Strauss-Kahn was IMF chief and had been expected to run for French presidency .

"(CNN) -- Is anybody out there? For millennia, humans have gazed at the night sky, asking this question. That's why scientists and NASA are eagerly searching for ""exoplanets"" -- that is, planets that orbit around stars other than our sun. Last week NASA's Kepler satellite reported the discovery of three Earth-sized exoplanets within the so-called ""habitable zone,"" defined as the neighborhood of a star where liquid water -- essential for life as we know it -- can exist. In our solar system, only three planets lie in the sun's habitable zone -- Venus, Earth and Mars. Planets too close to the star they orbit, like Mercury, are too hot for liquid water. Even Venus turns out to be too hot, thanks to a runaway greenhouse effect caused by its carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. Planets farther from their star, like Jupiter, are too cold, at least on its surface -- although Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, may have oceans of liquid water beneath an icy crust. 3 new planets could host life . Say hello to the three new exoplanets: Kepler 62e and Kepler 62f orbit are the fifth and sixth planets orbiting the star Kepler 62, and Kepler 69c is the third planet orbiting -- you guessed it -- Kepler 69. All three are nearly the same size as our Earth. Kepler 62f has a diameter 40% larger than the Earth's. It orbits its star once every 267 days, very similar to the 225-day period of Venus. We do not know what Kepler 62f is made of but other exoplanets of a similar size are known to be rocky, so that's the best guess for now. Kepler 62e is about 60% larger than the Earth and is probably hotter because it lies at the inner edge of the habitable zone, in a 122-day orbit -- slightly longer than Mercury's 88-day orbit. You can see a pattern: the shorter the orbital period, the closer the planet is to its star. For physics lovers, this follows directly from Newton's law of gravity -- but that's a lesson for another time. For now, I can tell you that one Mercury-year is 88 Earth-days, one Venus-year is 225 Earth-days, one Earth-year is 365 days, and one Jupiter year is about 12 Earth-years. (By ""year"" I mean the time that a planet takes to orbit its star. By ""day"" I mean the rotation period of the planet. What a ""day"" or ""year"" means clearly depends on the planet!) Since Kepler 62 is a cooler star than our sun, planets can orbit closer to it than the Earth can to our sun before overheating. In contrast, the third Earth-like planet, Kepler 69c, orbits a star very similar to our sun (that is, hotter than Kepler 62). It is 70% larger than the Earth and orbits Kepler 69 once every 242 days -- very like Venus. Debra Fischer, noted exoplanet hunter and my colleague at Yale, explained the significance of the discovery: ""The radii of these planets makes them the smallest ever detected outside the solar system. The host star is about a billion years older than our Sun, so it is intriguing to speculate about whether life might inhabit these planets."" We know from scientific studies on Earth that, given the right chemical elements and some energy, organic compounds form. Living organisms have been found even in apparently inhospitable regions of the Earth, like the driest deserts or Antarctica, or near thermal vents in the black depths of the ocean. With the right ingredients, it seems, life is nearly impossible to prevent. We don't know for sure whether there is life on Venus or Mars. If there is, it's unlikely to look like ET, canal-building aliens, or any other science fiction-type fantasy. Walking, talking aliens would have been visible decades ago to telescopes and rovers. But could there be intelligent life in another planetary system, in orbit around one of the 100 billion other stars in our Milky Way galaxy? Could we communicate with them? Could we visit them? The Kepler satellite was designed to look for planets around each of about 100,000 stars. As of April 19, 2013, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Planet Quest website reports 851 confirmed planets and 2781 candidates, totaling as many as 3,632 exoplanets. Most were discovered by scientists using Kepler data -- and a few were found by ordinary citizens analyzing Kepler data at planethunters.org. We can't travel to the nearest stars in a human lifetime -- such a journey would take tens of thousands of years with current technology. But we do have the technology to speak to distant civilizations. In fact, we've been broadcasting television signals to the cosmos for more than 80 years. We have had the technology to explore space and to communicate over long distances for less than 100 years -- a tiny fraction of the few million years since the first humans, much less the 4.5 billion years since the Earth formed. So it is likely that any other technologically sophisticated civilization would be far more advanced than we. That means they probably could let us know they were here, if they wanted to. For now, we can keep sending our TV broadcasts, listening for their broadcasts and studying exoplanets for signs of life. Thursday, at a meeting of the NASA science advisory committee I serve on, NASA Associate Administrator for Science and astronaut John Grunsfeld finished his presentation by giving us a heads up about the exciting Kepler exoplanet discoveries. As he said in the press release, we are ""a bit closer to finding a place like home. It is only a matter of time before we know if the galaxy is home to a multitude of planets like Earth, or if we are a rarity."" After our committee meeting ended today, I asked one of the NASA audio-visual staff whether he had heard about the new exoplanets. ""Oh yes,"" he answered, ""the ones in the habitable zone."" He asked whether life might exist on one of these planets, and whether we could visit them. Such ideas are why he is thrilled to work at NASA. People want to learn about life elsewhere in the universe. We want to visit those planets, to see what creatures live there, to compare to our own world -- to learn what is out there. Thanks to Kepler, NASA, dedicated scientists and curious citizens, we are that much closer to finding out. More space and science news from CNN Light Years .

"(CNN) -- A firefighter was killed Monday during a six-alarm blaze at a Dallas condominium complex, the city's fire department said. He was one of a team responding to the blaze at the Hearthwood North Condominiums, in northeast Dallas, when he became trapped in the building. Jason Evans, spokesman for Dallas Fire Rescue, identified the firefighter as Stanley Wilson. The fire has been classified as a six-alarm blaze for several reasons, the department said, including the search for Wilson. ""When firefighters arrived at the location, there was lots of smoke coming from the roof of a three-story condominium building,"" the department said. ""An offensive fire attack was initially attempted, but the fire was growing too quickly and caused them to have to move out for a defensive attack."" Two residents were treated for smoke inhalation at the scene. Two injured firefighters were taken to a hospital and are expected to recover. At least five residents were rescued from the building, the department said. The Red Cross has been called to help displaced residents. The cause of Wilson's death is under investigation.

"(CNN) -- Ever gotten on a plane and wound up in the wrong city? How about the wrong continent? According to a Los Angeles Times report, that's the travel nightmare story Sandy Valdivieso and her husband, Triet Vo, will get to tell for the rest of their lives. The couple boarded a flight in Los Angeles booked by Turkish Airways, intending to travel to Dakar, Senegal, in western Africa. Instead, they got off the plane in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in South Asia, almost 7,000 miles away. The culprit was apparently a mix-up between the similarly pronounced cities and the three-letter code used by airlines to distinguish airports. The three-letter airport code on the tickets issued to the couple by the airline read DAC, the code for the airport in Dhaka. The code for the airport in Dakar is DKR. The couple simply assumed that DAC was the code for their airport. ""Even after they'd settled into their seats -- 33A and 33B in economy class -- they had no idea anything was amiss,"" according to the Times. ""When the flight attendant said we were heading to Dhaka, we believed that this was how you pronounced 'Dakar' with a Turkish accent,"" Valdivieso told the Times. After connecting through Istanbul, the weary couple fell asleep on their next flight. When they awoke they began sensing a problem when they looked around to see a plane full of Asian faces, not African ones. A check of the inflight video map confirmed their fears. ""That's when we knew a serious mistake had been made,"" Valdivieso told the Times. After landing in Dhaka, the airline flew the couple to Dakar via Istanbul, about a six-hour trip. It took two more days for the pair's baggage to catch up to them. The couple booked their tickets in December; the report didn't say when they traveled.","Couple intends to fly to Africa, goes to Asia instead .

"(CNN) -- CNN anchor Anderson Cooper played the groom in a surreal wedding scene send-off for Bill Hader's Stefon character on the season finale of ""Saturday Night Live."" Hader announced last week that he was leaving SNL after eight seasons to move to California and get more sleep, which meant his memorable characters were also saying goodbye. Stefon -- Weekend Update's New York City correspondent -- gave one last report Saturday night, rushing off the set after telling anchor Seth Meyers, ""You never respect me."" ""I didn't want to do this here, but I've met someone else, and he's a lot like you, except he likes me for me, and we are getting married,"" Stefon said. ""Bye, Seth Meyers."" Stefon has always appeared to have a unrequited gay crush on the straight Meyers, but now Meyers seemed hurt by the rejection. ""Hey, go to him,"" Meyers' ""platonic work friend"" Amy Poehler said. ""It's never too late. Follow your heart."" Thus began a bizarre pre-produced segment that parodied the ""Wayne's World"" parody of Dustin Hoffman's frantic run to interrupt his true love's wedding in ""The Graduate."" Meyers ran from NBC's Rockefeller Center headquarters down 5th Avenue to Marble Collegiate Church, where he found Stefon at the altar. Fetish characters described in Stefon's many SNL reports made up the bridal party, including ""human traffic cones"" as bridesmaids. The camera panned to reveal his groom -- Anderson Cooper. A brawl ensued when Cooper stopped Meyers in the aisle. ""Get ready for Anderson Cooper -- 360!"" he said as he went into a slow motion round-about spin. But one punch from Meyers knocked Cooper out. Meyers grabbed Stefon, and the couple dashed away, while DJ Baby Bok Choy -- another character from Stefon's reports -- blocked Cooper from following. Wedding guests -- including smurfs, a gremlin and Alf -- converged to celebrate. Ben Affleck, host of the last episode of SNL's 38th season, made a cameo appearance, yelling to Meyers: ""Follow your heart, bro. Follow it!"" Meyers and Stefon then reappeared live on the ""Weekend Update"" set as SNL cast members tossed rice on them. Meyers is taking over NBC's ""Late Night"" show next year, although he is expected to return to SNL for season 39.","Bill Hader makes his final appearance after 8 seasons on ""Saturday Night Live""

"(CNN) -- Dr. Marguerite McDonald has a clear vision for helping people see better. Throughout her career, McDonald, an ophthalmologist at Ophthalmic Consultants of Long Island (New York), has performed several pioneering eye surgeries. In 1987, she performed the world's first excimer laser treatment, a procedure that eliminates or reduces the need for contact lenses. She used this technique in 1993 -- for the first time anywhere -- to treat farsightedness. An excimer laser is a type of laser used in eye surgeries. McDonald was also the third physician in the world to perform a procedure called conductive keratoplasty -- a noninvasive surgery for farsightedness that involves using radio-frequency energy to heat small spots around the cornea. She served as the medical monitor of clinical trials of the procedure in the United States, which led to Food and Drug Administration approval. In addition, McDonald conducted the first wavefront-based laser surgeries in the United States. Wavefront technology allows doctors to customize surgeries for individual patients. You don't know them, but these innovators may have changed your life . In September 2003, she was the first in North America to perform Epi-LASIK -- a relatively new procedure that may avoid some of the risks associated with LASIK -- in September 2003. ""Along with being noted for performing the first laser vision correction procedure... (McDonald) takes an active role in advancing women's careers through mentoring,"" Jan Beiting, president of Ophthalmic Women Leaders, said in a statement. ""She is a trailblazer in every way."" Ophthalmic Women Leaders announced in 2012 that she had won the organization's Visionary Woman Award. McDonald served as the director of the Southern Vision Institute in New Orleans from 1993 to 2005. Today, she is a clinical professor of ophthalmology at NYU School of Medicine, and an adjunct clinical professor of ophthalmology at Tulane University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans.

"Montreal (CNN) -- Home is the hardest place to find for children of immigrants, but for us, nothing hits closer to home than when a bomb goes off in Baghdad. Last week, just days after American troops pulled out of Iraq, 63 people died and 176 were wounded in Baghdad. As the son of Iraqis who left home in the late '70s, I find fleeting moments of hope that seldom return to me. The withering memories of my last visit to Basra play like broken records in my mind. I remember our grandparents' home, my uncle's dog and the size of the tires on his Jeep. I remember the smell distinctly but I can't put it into words. I remember feeling small; after all I was only 5. I have watched Iraq's tragedies only through television or the Internet for more than 20 years now. We make frantic fuzzy phone calls to Iraq, the voices on the other end are lost in reception; there is no awe in their shock. My aunt said that it felt like ""hell opened loose"" this past Thursday, heat lingering in the air as it rose from the rubble and twisted metal around Baghdad. The violence follows Iraqis' sense of security like the ghost of Saddam past. As we hang up the phone with our families, we are all wondering: Where do we go from here? With troops reaching home in time for the holidays, many are asking why they were there in the first place? We should have asked ourselves these questions many years ago. My cousin grew up with my grandparents in Iraq. As a child of the late eighties, he saw war for much of two decades coming out of their front door. I had the privilege of a selfish teenage rebellion in Montreal, as a voyeur into the war, watching news on our television. In the process, we were both detached from each other's realities. We spent some time together in the United Arab Emirates, after my maternal family had the rare opportunity to leave Iraq in 2005, drained by the successive wars pounding on their chests. The decades of bombings had taken its toll, far too often carrying bad news to those in the diaspora, sending ripples back through the hearts of all Iraqis. Those same bombs did something to my cousin. One night, we sat down and watched a movie together, something I had never done with him before. As a car exploded on the screen, his immediate reflex was to cover his ears and close his eyes. We noticed different things. He was transported back home, and I was lost. The contrast in our perspectives on life riddled me with guilt. Some of us take so much for granted. I switched the TV off. In the Mashtal area of Baghdad, a local women's NGO is offering an awareness seminar for widows. My sister-in-law returned from Baghdad last week, with pictures from the seminar. Most of the mothers and daughters, sometimes both widowed, lost their husbands in violence in 2007 and 2008. What is left of their homes is a fragmented family structure, compounded with the damage from decades of sanctions and mass exodus, lack of infrastructure, broken education systems and bouts of political corruption. I couldn't help but think about the future of the forgotten children of Iraq. That is what war is to me. War is the leftover pain in our hearts and souls. That detachment from home; trying to reach for safety. As Iraqis ran home from the violence and explosions in neighborhoods such as Karada, they couldn't cover their ears and eyes. There is no remote control for Baghdad. Most of your returning soldiers still feel that pain in their hearts. Nothing good came out of this war. There is no victory in any violence. With staggering body counts surfacing, and a possible link to rising cancer and birth defect rates, where do you start looking for justice? Where do we stand as an international body of people, looking for a new, positive outlook on our future? What a year.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Conservative candidate Park Geun-hye claimed victory Wednesday in South Korea's presidential election, a result that will make her the country's first woman president. Addressing crowds in Seoul's central Gwanghwamun Square, Park said her win was a victory for the people. ""I will be the president of the nation who keeps pledges,"" she said. ""This is considered a victory for people who want to overcome crisis and revive the economy. I will never forget the will of the people who believed in me wherever I went during the election campaign. ""I will start an era of happiness in the nation."" Her rival, liberal candidate Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party, conceded victory, according to South Korean network YTN. South Korea's outgoing President Lee Myung-bak congratulated Park on her win, which comes at a time of rising economic anxiety for the nation. The result has not yet been confirmed by the country's National Election Commission. But Park was leading with 51.66% of the vote, to 47.91% for her rival Moon, with more than 94% of the vote counted, election officials said. Read more: Pocket, not rocket, worries Koreans . The three major broadcasters in South Korea all projected a win for Park, the 60-year-old daughter of a former dictator who heads the governing conservative Saenuri party. U.S. President Barack Obama sent a message of congratulations to Park on Wednesday. ""I look forward to working closely with the Park Administration to further enhance our extensive cooperation with the Republic of Korea on a wide range of important bilateral, regional and global issues,"" he said. ""The U.S.-ROK alliance serves as a lynchpin of peace and security in the Asia Pacific, and our two nations share a global partnership with deep economic, security, and people-to-people ties."" Obama also praised Lee for what he said the outgoing leader ""has done to strengthen U.S.-ROK relations and promote a Global Korea."" Read more: Ghosts of past presidents loom over South Korea's election . Park will assume office in February 2013, in a country grappling with income inequality, angst over education and employment prospects for its youth, and strained relations with North Korea. South Korea is also a strategic Western ally and the fourth-largest economy in Asia. ""I hope the next president can put what the people want and how the country can develop before the interests of their own party,"" said Yong Sung-hwa, who voted in the morning. As in many other elections around the world, the economy is the No. 1 issue for South Korean voters. Though the Asian country has fared far better than other countries, including the United States, during the economic crisis, its export-led economy has still felt the pinch. Read more: South Korea's election paradox . ""This country depends on the world's economy,"" said Jong Kun Choi, associate professor in the department of political science and international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. ""Eighty-nine percent of our GDP comes from the international trade."" The election appeared to be a showdown of generations. Park enjoys broad support from older Koreans in their 50s and 60s, while Moon has strong support from younger Koreans. In a survey conducted by the National Election Commission, 80% of the respondents said they would vote, despite frigid weather. Lee, the outgoing president, could not run for re-election, as it is prohibited by Korea's constitution. He will leave office next year dogged by low approval ratings, an impasse with North Korea, and corruption scandals involving his family and inner circle. The Korean presidency has not enjoyed a sterling reputation. Park and Moon also bring baggage from the past. Park is the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, whose legacy left the Korean public divided. Some claim he was a dictator who ignored human rights and cracked down on dissent, while others credit him with bringing economic development to South Korea. Her father's assassination in 1979 ended his 16 years of rule. Moon is a former human rights activist who was imprisoned in the 1970s for protesting Park's father's regime. He is also a former special forces commando and holds a black belt in judo. Like Park, he carries divisive associations with the past. He was chief of staff for the late President Roh Moo-hyun, who was in office from 2003 to 2008. Roh committed suicide in 2009 amid an investigation into a bribery scandal. Throughout the campaign, Moon portrayed himself as the down-to-earth choice, calling for welfare reform and economic democracy. Both candidates pledged reforms including engagement with North Korea, reining in the country's big conglomerates -- like Samsung and Hyundai -- support for small and medium-sized businesses and more social spending, although their proposed methods differ. Read more: South Korea: A presidential election primer . ""I'm concerned about homeland security, foreign policy and the economy,"" voter Lee Dong-hoon said. ""Among those, the economy is the most important. We need to raise the number of the middle class."" The election comes at a time of sluggish growth and increasing poverty. In October, the Bank of Korea, the nation's central bank, lowered its growth forecast for next year to 2.4% from its previous prediction of 3%. Since 2006, the number of residents living in relative poverty has jumped 10%. Almost one-fifth of the population earns less than half the national average income, according to Statistics Korea, a government agency. Nowhere in the country is the gap between rich and poor more stark than Guryong village, part of the exclusive Gangnam district of Seoul, made famous by the viral ""Gangnam Style"" song by rapper PSY. Lee Ha-soong, 80, has lived in the neighborhood for 30 years. Her home is a patchwork of wood and corrugated iron, sandwiched between other improvised cabins. In heavy rain or snow, she is forced to stay with neighbors as her 5-square-meter home floods. After seeing presidents come and go, Lee is unimpressed by their promises. ""Every election and every Christmas, politicians come and ask me, 'How are you, Grandma? How can we help?' It's always the same questions. I tell them, 'If you can't change anything, why are you asking such useless questions?' "" Despite plans to raze the shacks and build low-income apartments for these residents, Lee is unconvinced that change will happen. Less than a kilometer away from her shack, high-rise apartments stretch into the sky. The cheapest apartment in these buildings cost a cool $1.2 million in an area known as the Beverly Hills of Seoul.

"(CNN) -- Commuters who rely on the train between New Haven, Connecticut, and New York will be able to resume their usual travel Wednesday morning, five days after a derailment on one of the busiest tracks in the country. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy announced the resumption of the Metro-North line service in a new conference in which he also praised the timely work. ""This is very, very good news and something that we did not think could be accomplished, but full operations are expected to begin on Wednesday morning,"" said Malloy. Amtrak released a statement shortly after the announcement saying service between Boston and New York will also resume Wednesday morning. Because of the inconvenience, Amtrak said passengers who ""have paid but choose not to travel due to this service disruption can receive a refund or a voucher for future travel."" Commuters were warned that Monday's commute could be rough and that they should expect ""substantial delays."" But at 9 a.m., there were no lines and plenty of shuttle buses to take passengers around the 2,000 feet of bad track. Starting at 4:30 a.m., buses carrying 40 to 55 passengers each left Bridgeport, Connecticut, for Stamford. ""We scared the heck out of people, and it worked,"" a Connecticut Department of Transportation official at the site said. Officials say either people stayed home, took Monday off, or are waiting to see how things go. Even traffic flow was said to be normal for a Monday commute. More than 30,000 passengers travel the rail corridor daily. One Metro North employee with direct knowledge of the head count told CNN that the roughly 2,000 people who took the train from New Haven to Bridgeport Monday morning were ""far, far fewer than normal."" Federal investigators are trying to determine what caused Friday's derailment of a northbound Metro-North train that struck Metro-North train that was headed south. Investigators have ruled out foul play in the crash, which injured more than 70 people. John Cappiello, a spokesman for Bridgeport Hospital in Connecticut, said three patients were still there Monday -- one person in critical condition and two listed as stable. Two patients remained at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, both in good condition, spokeswoman Lucinda Ames said. Several officials at the tracks Monday morning wondered whether the number of commuters would pick up Tuesday once passengers saw how things went. Rebuilding the tracks . All the rail cars had been removed from the accident site by Sunday afternoon, Earl Weener of the National Transportation Safety Board said. Two segments of rail in the area of the fracture also had been removed and are being sent to a laboratory for analysis, he said. None of the cars flipped over when the two trains collided, but many cars were heavily damaged. Some had gaping holes where doors had been. Deep scrape marks could be seen where one train sideswiped the other. Investigators will look at the trains' braking performances, speed, wheel and track conditions as well as information from data recorders, Weener said. In addition to the trains, investigators also are examining the actions of the crews. He said the track could have been broken by the accident or could have been fractured before the trains collided. This accident involved commuter rail cars built to new codes, he said Sunday. ""This gives us a chance to see how effective the new standards are,"" Weener said. The two tracks will have to be repaired before they can be reopened. ""Our crews will essentially be rebuilding 2,000 feet of damaged track and overhead wires and signal system,"" Metro-North Railroad President Howard Permut said in a statement. 'Absolutely staggering' damage . The damage to the tracks and several train cars is ""absolutely staggering,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who visited the site with other officials over the weekend. Wreckage littered an area of about 200 yards. ""Ribbons of the sides of cars are torn away like ribbons of cloth,"" the senator said. ""Tons of metal tossed around like toy things. The insides of cars are shattered."" The two Metro-North passenger trains collided Friday evening in southwestern Connecticut. The train headed from New York City to New Haven derailed around 6:10 p.m. and struck the other train in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Weener said. Both trains were traveling at about 70 mph immediately before the crash. CNN's Steve Almasy, Dana Ford, Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- This week on ""The Big Three,"" we take a look at what might have been Obama's worst week ever -- as a negative trifecta of scandals threaten to overwhelm his administration and derail his ambitious legislative agenda. We get a reality check with special guest, U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison. And no talk about the biggest stories of the week would be complete without a conversation about Angelina Jolie's decision to have a preemptive double mastectomy and the message it sends to millions. The scandals outweighed what might have otherwise have been regarded as a stretch of good news for Obama on the economy, with the Dow hitting historic highs and the Congressional Budget Office prediciing this week that the budget deficit will shrink to $642 billion. But these stories were quickly eclipsed. Benghazi looked bad enough. But the unwelcome addition of the IRS and Associated Press phone scandals have outraged even administration allies and led some critics to suggest that the second-term president's agenda is now stalled. Let's look at the IRS first. It's nobody favorite agency but the news that agents has inappropriately singled out conservative groups for additional scrutiny when applying for tax exempt status sent ripples of outrage through the political landscape. The fact that an inspector general report found no connection to the White House and that none of the conservative groups were ultimately denied tax-exempt status provided cold comfort because of the chilling effect of the inquiry. The president fired the acting head of the IRS and a second high-ranking official, but congressional hearings are looming. (For some fun fireworks, Margaret disagrees with my prescription for the problem: more IRS investigations on partisan political groups applying for tax-exempt status, with the crucial exception that those inquiries should be scrupulously nonpartisan.) The second scandal hit the press where it lived. The Associated Press was informed this week that the Justice Department had subpoenaed reporters' phone records over a leak that the attorney general, Eric Holder, said compromised national security and lives. That Republicans had initially demanded the investigation for what they called election-year grandstanding by the Obama administration on its record against al-Qaeda did not stop their condemnation. But now that the press has found its privacy compromised, my guess is that there will be new scrutiny on this issue. The administration's response was a renewed push for the media shield law. But make no mistake -- neither of these scandals is over. The big question is whether they will derail the president's legislative agenda -- specifically, the goal of passing bipartisan immigration reform. Dean introduces our guest this week on ""The Big Three,"" Rep. Ellison, D-Minnesota, who describes himself as ""cautiously optimistic"" on the chance for legislation to still move through in this polarized, hyperpartisan environment. His remarks offer a helpful and hopeful reality check from the perspective of someone working inside the Capitol. Finally, Angelina Jolie. Margaret leads this conversation about a new awareness about decisions women can make, armed with the information provided by genetic testing. Jolie was able to determine that she had an overwhelmingly high chance of developing breast cancer and so the actress often described as ""the sexiest woman in the world"" opted to have a double mastectomy. Beyond the issues of science and women's health, we all agree that Jolie's courageous actions are a positive example of how to leverage celebrity for the greater good. The Lohans and Beibers of the world should take notes. It's a rare example of our celebrity-gossip-obsessed culture actually adding to the world's intelligence rather than detracting from it.

"(CNN) -- The jury in the Jodi Arias trial has one decision left to make: Should she live or die? After months of dramatic testimony full of so many twists and turns that people lined up for seats in the Phoenix courtroom, jurors began deliberations Tuesday to decide whether Arias should get the death penalty or life in prison for murdering her ex-boyfriend. Earlier this month, jurors convicted Arias of first-degree murder and found that she was ""exceptionally cruel"" when she killed Travis Alexander in 2008. She stabbed him 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face. On Tuesday, the same jury that found Arias guilty of murder deliberated for about an hour and a half before adjourning for the day. They are scheduled to come back to court and continue weighing her fate Wednesday at 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET). Arias pleaded for her life to be spared, telling jurors Tuesday that she could teach people to read in prison and make a positive impact on inmates. She also called the murder of Alexander ""the worst mistake"" she'd ever made, ""the worst thing I've ever done."" She couldn't have imagined herself capable of such a grizzly crime. ""But I know that I was,"" she said. ""And for that I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer."" She told jurors that she had been a victim of abuse as an adult and as a child. She showed several family photos from holidays and vacations. She claimed she was a gentle person who caught spiders in cups and took them outside rather than kill them. And she showed the jurors several pieces of her artwork. ""I'm not going to become a mother because of my own terrible choices,"" she said, adding that she would no longer be able to paint with oil, either. It was a drastic change in tone from less than two weeks ago, when a tearful Arias, minutes after her murder conviction, told a local television station that she wanted to be sentenced to death. Explaining her decision not to request the death penalty, Arias said Tuesday that her family -- to whom she pointed in the courtroom -- gave her the strength to continue living. Her previous comments about her desire to die were sincere when she expressed them, Arias said. ""Each time I said that, though I meant it,"" she said, ""I lacked perspective."" She noted she could bring ""people together in a constructive and positive way"" by participating in various programs, including prisoner literacy initiatives, her ""Survivor"" T-shirts, which would benefit victims of domestic violence, and by donating her hair so it could be used to make wigs for sick children. Beginning about 90 minutes later than scheduled, Arias, 32, said she never wanted the ""graphic, mortifying, horrific details (of her and Alexander's relationship) paraded out into the public arena."" ""It's never been an intention of mine to malign his name or character,"" she said. Defense attorney Jennifer Willmott argued Tuesday that Arias' life should be spared. ""We're not talking about whether or not to convict. We're talking about whether or not to kill. And so when we talk about that, it matters that she was 27 years old and she had no criminal history,"" she said. ""It matters that she hadn't done anything wrong in her life befo re that."" Prosecutor Juan Martinez said pointing to Arias' artwork as evidence that her life should be spared wasn't a valid defense. ""It's an entitlement road that they want you to travel when they talk to you about the fact that she's a good artist,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean anything. All it means is, give her special or preferential treatment."" He argued that jurors should sentence Arias to death. ""You have a duty, and that duty really means that you actually do the honest, right thing, even though it may be difficult,"" he said. ""And in this case ... the only thing you can do based on the mitigating circumstances and their lack of, is to return a verdict of death."" During the trial, Arias claimed she killed Alexander in self-defense after he attacked her. After the guilty verdict, she told a local television station that she had no interest in life in prison. ""I said years ago that I'd rather get death than life, and that still is true today,"" she told Phoenix television station KSAZ. ""I believe death is the ultimate freedom, so I'd rather just have my freedom as soon as I can get it."" The penalty phase of the trial took a sudden break Monday, when the judge said that proceedings could not continue and that Arias would make the statement to the jury. The adjournment followed Judge Sherry Stephens' dismissal of a defense motion for a mistrial and ended a session in which the defense called no witnesses on Arias' behalf. Also denied was a second request by Arias' lawyers to withdraw from the case. Arias, who testified for 18 days during the trial, was not cross-examined after her Tuesday statement, which Stephens said was not under oath. For Arias to be sentenced to death, the jury's decision must be unanimous. In the case of a deadlock, a new jury would be chosen for this phase only. If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state. Haven't been following the trial? Read this . HLNTV.com: Friend of Arias tweeting on her behalf .

"(CNN) -- Olafur Ragnar Grimsson is currently enjoying a third term as President of the Republic of Iceland. Since first being elected in 1996, Grimsson has been a passionate advocate of international cooperation in combating climate change. Olafur Ragnar Grimsson . Whilst Iceland still imports oil for its transport, electricity is generated from hydroelectric power. And heating is provided by geothermal power -- an abundant source in energy due to Iceland's geographical position sitting above two continental plates. Iceland is also pioneering the use of hydrogen power with several projects testing the viability of this renewable energy. In his youth, Grimsson studied Economics and Political Science at Manchester University, gaining a B.A. and a Ph.D before returning to Iceland to take up a post as a professor of Political Science at the University of Iceland. He entered Althingi, the Icelandic parliament in 1978, served as minister of finance between 1988 and 1991 and was leader of the Peoples' Alliance from 1987 to 1995.

"(TIME.com) -- Promising trials hinted that circumcision could lower rates of HIV infection, but until now, researchers didn't fully understand why. Now, in a study published in the journal mBio, scientists say that changes in the population of bacteria living on and around the penis may be partly responsible. Relying on the latest technology that make sequencing the genes of organisms faster and more accessible, Lance Price of the Translational Genomics Research institute (TGen) and his colleagues conducted a detailed genetic analysis of the microbial inhabitants of the penis among a group of Ugandan men who provided samples before circumcision and again a year later. TIME.com: If circumcision rates keep falling, health costs and infections will spike . While the men showed similar communities of microbes before the operation, 12 months later, the circumcised men harbored dramatically fewer bacteria that survive in low oxygen conditions. They also had 81% less bacteria overall compared to the uncircumcised men, and that could have a dramatic effect on the men's ability to fight off infections like HIV, says Price. Previous studies showed that circumcised men lowered their risk of transmitting HIV by as much as 50%, making the operation an important tool in preventing infection with the virus. Why? A high burden of bacteria could disrupt the ability of specialized immune cells known as Langerhans cells to activate immune defenses. Normally, Langerhans are responsible for grabbing invading microbes like bacteria or viruses and presenting them to immune cells for training, to prime the body to recognize and react against the pathogens. But when the bacterial load increases, as it does in the uncircumcised penile environment, inflammatory reactions increase and these cells actually start to infect healthy cells with the offending microbe rather than merely present them. TIME.com: Can new circumcision devices help fight AIDS in Africa? That may be why uncircumcised men are more likely to transmit HIV than men without the foreskin, says Price, since the Langerhans cells could be feeding HIV directly to healthy cells. His group is also investigating how changes in the levels of cytokines, which are the signaling molecules that immune cells use to communicate with each other, might be influenced by bacterial populations. ""There is a real revolution going on in our understanding of the microbiome,"" says Price, who is also professor of occupational and environmental health at George Washington University. ""The microbiome is almost like another organ system, and we are just scratching the surface of understanding the interplay between the microbiome and the immune system."" Previous work suggested that changes in the bacterial populations in the gut, for example, could affect obesity, and other studies found potential connections between microbial communities and the risk for cancer, asthma and other chronic conditions.

"Herat, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of protesters took to the streets Saturday across Afghanistan, the fifth day of demonstrations over the burning of Qurans at a U.S. base, officials said. Four civilians were killed and 50 injured amid protests near the United Nations office in Kunduz, said Saad Mokhtar, head of the city's health department. Twelve police officers were among the wounded. Gulam Mohamad Farhad, the intelligence head of Kunduz, said the protesters tried to burn down the U.N. building. The U.N.'s Afghan mission said all its staff in Kunduz and throughout the country are ""unhurt."" It denounced the attack on its compound, regretted the casualties and thanked Afghan police for their timely response to the violent protests. The mission also said it understands Muslim anger over the Quran desecration. ""At the same time, we call upon those who would wish to express their legitimate religious sentiments to reject calls to violence, to exercise self-restraint and to avoid resorting to protests and demonstrations in order not to allow the enemies of peace to take advantage of the situation,"" the mission said in a statement. The protests began after NATO troops recently burned Qurans at Bagram Airfield. The burnings sent throngs of protesters to the streets and military bases, some chanting, ""Death to America."" A military official said the materials burned were removed from a detainee center's library because they had ""extremist inscriptions"" on them and there was ""an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications."" American officials, including President Barack Obama, apologized and said burning them was an unintentional error, but protests raged on nonetheless. In a letter to his Afghan counterpart, President Hamid Karzai, Obama called the act ""inadvertent."" Four U.S. service members have died in Afghanistan since the outrage turned violent. A gunman Saturday shot dead two American officers inside the Afghan interior ministry in Kabul and escaped. A Taliban spokesman said the attack, for which the group claimed responsibility, was in response to the recent burnings. NATO and Afghan officials are investigating and have not confirmed involvement by the Islamist militant group. The commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, addressed the Quran burning issue during a visit to a military base where two U.S. soldiers were killed Thursday by a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform. A protest over the burning of Qurans was taking place outside the base at the time of the killings. Allen called on troops to ""show the Afghan people that as bad as that act was at Bagram, it was unintentional, and Americans and ISAF soldiers do not stand for this. We stand for something greater than that."" The protests on Saturday took place in various provinces, including Laghman, Paktika, Baghlan and Nurestan, according to a spokesman for the interior ministry. In Laghman province, at least 15 people were injured when hundreds of protesters tried to attack the governor's house and office, authorities said. Police and soldiers intervened, with some injured in the confrontation, said Abdul Rahman Sarjang, a local police chief. Two civilians and an officer were in critical condition, Sarjang said. But protests in most of the northern regions ended peacefully, police spokesman Lal Mohamed Ahmadzai said. At least eight people were killed and 27 wounded in protests Friday, mostly in Herat province, according to Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for the interior ministry. No international coalition members have been wounded in the protests, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. The burning at Bagram was not the first time that damaging Qurans -- or even the threat to do so -- has provoked angry Muslim reaction. Terry Jones, the pastor of a tiny evangelical church in Florida, announced plans to burn the Muslim holy book on the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. He was persuaded not to do it at the time, but he made good on the threat six months later. Two weeks after that, protesters in northern Afghanistan attacked a U.N compound, leaving 12 people dead. In Kandahar, three people were killed in one demonstration, and nine in another when police and stone-throwing demonstrators clashed. ""The first belief among Muslims of all types is that the Quran is the word of God,"" said Shainool Jiwa, of the Institute of Ismaili Studies in London. ""The words themselves, the typing, takes on a level of sanctity. There is a sacredness about it."" But, she said, violent reactions to its burning are as much a sign of the times as an expression of faith. ""There is a history behind this. It's much more reflective of the times we are in, the protests and anger,"" she said. ""This whole issue has become politicized.""

"(CNN) -- At least one performer fell hard for Sunday night's Billboard Music Awards. Not sure what that means? Well, check out the top five moments from Sunday night's 2013 Billboard Music Awards: . 1. Miguel lands on a fan . The R & B singer accidentally landed on a woman in the mosh pit during a performance of his hit song ""Adorn."" He was attempting a jump that went wrong. The fan appeared to be fine and the singer kept singing. Miguel later tweeted: ""got caught up in the moment, thank goodness Khyati is okay."" 2. Taylor Swift wins eight out of the 11 awards she was up for . Swift is no stranger to taking to the stage to accept accolades, and on Sunday night she collected a few, including Billboard Artist of the Year. ""My album is kind of on the ends of the intense emotional spectrum,"" Swift said while accepting that award. ""You (fans) are the longest and best relationship I have ever had."" She also won Top Country Artist,Top Billboard 200 Artist, Top Female Artist, and Top Digital Songs Artist -- the last one a tie with singer Carly Rae Jepsen. Swift's album ""Red"" won in the Top Billboard 200 and Country Album categories and her single ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" collected the trophy for Top Country Song. 3. Justin Bieber gets booed . While accepting the first ever Milestone Award, the Biebs was both cheered and jeered. He appeared to reference the rough times he has had of late in his acceptance speech. ""I'm 19 years old, I think I'm doing a pretty good job,"" Bieber said. ""And basically from my heart I really just want to say it should really be about the music ... the craft. ... This is not a gimmick, I'm an artist and I should be taken seriously and all this other bull should not be spoken of."" The incident caused the show's host, Tracy Morgan, to quip, ""Hey, don't be booing anybody here. This ain't no high school."" 4. Nicki Minaj twerks on Lil Wayne . Since this is a family website, we won't explain ""twerking,"" but let's just say Minaj has a little something in common with Miley Cyrus when it comes to the seductive dance. During a performance of her song ""High School,"" Minaj gave rapper Lil Wayne (who appears on the track) a lap dance. Taking a break from her ""American Idol"" judging duties, the rap songstress received the first award of the night, Top Rap Artist. 5. Prince shows them how it is done . By far one of the best moments of the night came courtesy of a man who hasn't even been on the charts in a while. Prince took to the stage with a new look and celebrated being presented with the Icon Award with a medley of his hits ""Let's Go Crazy"" and ""FixUrLifeUp."" He appeared to be channeling Jimi Hendrix with his Afro and wicked guitar riffs while being backed by an all-female band. The crowd took his advice and did, indeed, go crazy.

The sandals come from a house at Juhu Beach, in Maharashtra, western India, where Gandhi lived from 1917 to 1934, the auction listing says. They have a guide price of 10,000 to 15,000 British pounds. Another lot from the same house features a handwoven linen shawl ""made from thread which Gandhi spun himself,"" according to the auction house. Photographs, paintings and audio recordings of Gandhi are also up for sale, as well as personal documents and household items belonging to the former leader. Book of the week on the great soul of Mahatma Gandhi . The documents include a two-page will, handwritten ""in a neat secretarial hand"" in Gujarati and signed by Gandhi, the auction house said. It is expected to fetch 30,000 to 40,000 pounds. The independence leader, who was born Mohandas Gandhi in Gujarat in 1869, became known as Mahatma, or ""great-souled,"" for his efforts toward social and political progress for his countrymen. He was a key figure in the Indian National Congress and led the Indian nationalist movement against British rule, characterized by a campaign of civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance. India achieved independence in August 1947. Gandhi was nominated five times for the Nobel Peace Prize -- in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947 and finally in January 1948, a few days before he was assassinated -- but was never awarded it. No peace prize was given in 1948. Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","A microscope slide with a trace of Gandhi's blood is up for auction in England .

"(CNN) -- Want to marvel at California's giant sequoias or hike the Mount Katahdin section of the Appalachian Trail? With most of the United States' national parks still shuttered, the country's stunning state parks are getting some well-deserved attention. There are more than 7,800 state park sites around the country, attracting over 720 million visits per year, according to the National Association of State Park Directors. By comparison, the National Park Service's 401 sites had over 282 million visitors last year. Many state park visitors are repeat visitors, enjoying the state parks near where they live. Here are some of our favorites. Calaveras Big Trees State Park, California . Known for its North Grove of giant sequoias, Calaveras Big Trees State Park became a state park more than 80 years ago. Within the grove is the first redwood documented by Augustus T. Dowd in 1852, known as the ""Discovery Tree"" and the ""Big Stump."" This park is considered the state's longest continuously operated tourist site. The South Grove has a five-mile hiking trail through the sequoias. Located about 150 miles north of San Francisco, the park is open for day visitors and campers. Fall Creek Falls State Park, Tennessee . The most popular state park in Tennessee, Fall Creek Falls State Park is about a two-hour drive east of Nashville. The park's more than 20,000 acres includes the highest waterfall in the Eastern United States, virgin hardwood timber stands and spectacular places to spend the day hiking or staying to camp. While oak and hickory trees can be found in most of the park, the gorges host tulip poplar and hemlock forests. Stone Mountain State Park, North Carolina . A National Natural Landmark, Stone Mountain features a 600-foot granite dome that doesn't disappoint the first-time visitor. Hike, fish, rock or camp surrounded by 14,000 acres of the park's forests, waterfalls and streams. (There are more than 16 miles of trails and 20 miles of designated trout waters.) Visitors can also enjoy learning about historic mountain living at the Hutchinson Homestead, which includes a blacksmith shop, meat house, log cabin and barn. Statue of Liberty, Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore to reopen . Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Florida . About 10 miles from Everglades National Park in Florida, rare and endangered tropical plants thrive in the waters of the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park. Sometimes called the Amazon of North America, the Fakahatchee Strand is the only ecosystem in the world where bald cypress trees and royal palms share the same forest canopy. It's also home to 44 native orchid species. Animal fans might spot American crocodiles, Florida panthers and black bears, Everglade minks and Eastern indigo snakes. Water enthusiasts can enjoy fishing, canoeing and kayaking. Even hikers can walk on trails created upon many of the raised railway beds of the old logging train that still crisscross the Fakahatchee Strand. The beds create a grid of trails, many of which are maintained for hiking. Baxter State Park, Maine . The highest point in Maine, Baxter State Park's Mount Katahdin is the northern most point on the Appalachian Trail. Katahdin is often considered the most difficult hike on the trail, and Maine is considered one of the most difficult states on the trail. Even if you're not tackling the trail, Baxter State Park requires preparation. It has incredible and difficult rock climbing, more than 200 miles of hiking trails and cold weather that will require you bundle up for your outdoor fun. Travelers looking for an easy hike can try Big and Little Niagara Falls while experienced hikers looking for a daylong trip can try the more difficult hike to Baxter Peak. Finding spirituality on the Appalachian Trail . Punderson State Park, Ohio . Once a quiet lake resort for Clevelanders looking for a break from the city, Punderson became a state park in 1951. The 741-acre park is in Ohio's glaciated plateau region and used to be buried under glacial ice. Visitors can enjoy boating, fishing, golf, swimming and hiking. In the winter, the park features a lighted sledding hill, three snowmobile trails, two cross-country ski trails and even dog sledding on the Mushers Trail. Kealakekua Bay State Historical Park, Hawaii . With the arrival of Captain Cook in 1779, this is the site where Hawaiians and Westerners first had extended contact. But the bay had been settled more than 1,000 years ago, before Westerners arrived. There is much that is sacred and protected in this historical park, and visitors are asked to respect spiritual and archeological sites where ceremonial structures once stood. The Ka'awaloa Cove is home to some of the best snorkeling in the area, and it's also home to a delicate, living coral reef. Spinner dolphins also visit the bay to rest and nurse their young. The Pali Kapu O Keoua is a 600-foot high pali, or volcanic fault line and vertical sea cliff created by landslides and waves. Travelers should also avoid disturbing the natural environment for these animals and plant life, and stay away from the pali to avoid injury. Kartchner Caverns State Park, Arizona . About 55 miles from Tucson, Kartchner Caverns State Park has Arizona's tallest natural column formation below ground level (and the world's longest stalactite formation). Book the cave tour to see this remarkable underground state park -- the cave is 2.4 miles long and remained hidden until its discovery in the 1970s. Come back for above-ground introductions to camping, Halloween parties and other activities. Camping: Horror or bliss? State Forest State Park, Colorado . Northwest of Rocky Mountain National Park, State Forest State Park's 71,000 acres offer the spectacular beauty of alpine lakes, trails, forests and moose viewing. The park has more than 600 moose in residence year-round. Head to North Park, the ""moose viewing capital of Colorado,"" to see them. There is lots of winter sports activity and six rustic cabins for rent year-round. Snow Canyon State Park, Utah . Located in the 62,000-acre Red Cliffs Desert Reserve at the intersection of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin desert and the Mojave Desert, Snow Canyon State Park averages only 7.5 inches of rain annually. There's evidence that lava flowed down park canyons, filling them with basalt as recently as 27,000 years ago. The animal and plant life living within the 7,400-acre park have adapted to the desert environment. Look for protected species such as gila monsters, peregrine falcons and desert tortoises.

"(CNN) -- Authorities launched a search Thursday after two passengers went missing overnight off Australia's eastern coast. The 30-year-old man and 26-year-old woman were reported missing when the Carnival Cruise ship Spirit docked in Sydney on Thursday morning, CNN affiliate Seven Network reported. The first clue came when they didn't claim their luggage. Police, who have examined onboard video, believe the couple went overboard about 150 kilometers (93 miles) off Foster, New South Wales. ""We believe that they were up mid-deck, which is halfway up the side of the ship, which is quite a way to fall,"" said Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings of the New South Wales Police Marine Area Command.

Despite the 220-kilometer (135 mile) distance from Foster to Sydney, police said they remain optimistic . ""It's game on and we are going to be pulling out all stops to try and find these people,"" Hutchings said. These developments are the latest in a series of high-profile incidents involving the cruise line. In February, an engine room fire left the Carnival Triumph adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, with passengers reporting overflowing toilets and human waste running down the walls in some parts of the ship.

"(CNN) -- Who, exactly, owns your Twitter account? It's a potentially complicated question when an account is used both professionally and personally. Now a case regarding whether a Twitter account belongs to a company or its former employee has raised questions about the use of the social media phenomenon. PhoneDog, a website devoted to all things mobile products and services, sued former employee Noah Kravitz for $340,000, according to the complaint filed in US District Court in the Northern District of California. The lawsuit, which was filed in July, alleges that Kravitz' continued use of a Twitter account he was ""given use of"" while employed with PhoneDog was a misappropriation of trade secrets and damaged the company's business, goodwill, and reputation. Kravitz was a product reviewer and video blogger for PhoneDog for about four years, during which time he used the Twitter account @PhoneDog_Noah. The complaint states that Kravitz ""used the Account to disseminate information and promote PhoneDog's services on behalf of PhoneDog."" But Kravitz told CNN he opened the account, linked it to his personal e-mail address and maintained it himself while tweeting both personal and professional things throughout his employment with PhoneDog, including links to his own articles and colleagues' articles, as well as tweets about sports, arts, and food. ""It's this melding of personal and professional which is why I've gained a modest following,"" Kravitz said. ""Because it's not just the dry headline and link to something."" According to the complaint, PhoneDog asked Kravitz to let go of the Twitter account when he resigned in October 2010, but instead of getting rid of it, he changed the handle to @noahkravitz and continued to use and tweet under the account. Kravitz, who says he left on amicable terms, disputes this claim, saying PhoneDog did not ask for the account back, but said it was OK if he kept the account and asked him to tweet from time to time on their behalf. ""At no point until July of this year, a good 8 months after we parted ways, did they ask for the twitter account or claim in was their property."" PhoneDog alleges Kravitz ""is attempting to discredit PhoneDog and destroy the confidence that PhoneDog's users have in PhoneDog"" through continued use of the Twitter account. In the course of Kravitz's employment, the Twitter account garnered about 17,000 followers. The complaint states that according to industry standards, each follower is valued at about $2.50 per month, so incorporating that value, the 17,000 followers of the account, and the eight months since Kravitz resigned from PhoneDog, the company arrived at the $340,000 claim. Who really owns a Twitter account? CNN's Richard Quest weighs in . As social media accounts become increasingly relevant for employers, the line between personal and professional Twitter accounts begins to blur, and a pair of intellectual property lawyers see new precedents on the horizon. ""This is an issue with Twitter, with Facebook, with any of the social media sites where people have accounts and they're using them for work purposes,"" Henry J. Cittone told CNN. ""That ownership for those accounts is in play right now."" Mark V.B. Partridge noted that because Twitter is relatively new, disputes that have come up have been settled. But he compared this case to situations in the past in which employees who left a company tried to take registered domain names with them but were not allowed. Partridge said that if this one does go to a court decision, ""it would certainly be a precedent out there."" Asked whether or not he thinks a case like this has any merit, Cittone said, ""It's going to boil down to whether he was paid to create (the account) for the company or not."" And he thinks PhoneDog may have a chance at winning the case, ""because they've patched the arguments quickly. They said they hired him to create this feed for them -- that is the way the company could dislodge a Twitter feed from its owner."" Kravitz, who is now editor-at-large for Techno Buffalo, said he is starting to understand the magnitude of the situation. ""This idea of what belongs to the employee, what belongs to the employers, where's the influence coming from, what constitutes doing something on company time -- these lines are all really blurry right now."" Neither PhoneDog nor Twitter responded to CNN's requests for comment.","PhoneDog, ex-employee argue about ownership of Twitter account he used .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live asked Michael Jackson's estate to repay the concert promoter $300,000 for Dr. Conrad Murray's fee three weeks after Jackson's death, court testimony revealed Monday. The revelation contradicts AEG Live's defense that it did not hire or pay the doctor convicted in Jackson's death. ""To me, it's a mistake,"" AEG Live Senor Vice President and General Counsel Shawn Trell said when confronted with a letter sent to Jackson's estate. Trell, testifying Monday in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial, also said his company's chief financial officer made another major error by classifying Dr. Murray's fees as ""production costs"" and not ""advances"" in all of the budgets for Jackson's ""This It It"" tour. ""Mistakenly, yes,"" Trell said. Despite these ""mistakes,"" Trell called the CFO ""a very detailed-oriented guy."" Jackson's mother and children are suing AEG Live, contending the concert promoter is liable in the singer's death because its executives negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The promoters ignored a series of red flags that should have warned them Jackson was in danger as he was pressured to get ready for his comeback concerts, the Jackson lawsuit claims. AEG Live lawyers counter that it was Jackson who chose, hired and supervised Murray, and that he was responsible for his own bad decisions. Its executives could not be expected to know Murray was using the surgical anesthetic propofol, the drug the coroner ruled killed Jackson, to treat his insomnia, they argue. Testimony from Trell -- and, earlier, AEG LIve controller Julie Hollander -- showed the company's budgets included $1.5 million to pay Murray $150,000 a month. The budget terminology could be key in the jury's decision on AEG's liability, since production costs were the promoter's responsibility, while advances were basically loans to Jackson. The revelation that the doctor's fees were designated as production contradicts the defense that AEG lead lawyer Marvin Putnam shared with CNN before the trial. AEG Live's role with Murray was only to ""forward"" money owed to him by Jackson, just as a patient would use his ""MasterCard,"" Putnam said. ""If you go to your doctor and you pay with a credit card, obviously, MasterCard in that instance, depending on your credit card, is providing the money to that doctor for services until you pay it back. Now, are you telling them MasterCard in some measure in that instance, did MasterCard hire the doctor or did you? Well, clearly you did. I think the analogy works in this instance."" Jackson manager's e-mails found, could be key in AEG trial . The doctor signed the contract prepared by AEG lawyers and sent it back to the company a day before Jackson's death. The company argues it was not an executed contract because their executives and Michael Jackson never signed it. The Jackson lawyers argue that e-mails, budget documents and the fact that the doctor was already working for two months showed a binding agreement between AEG and Murray. Panish, speaking outside of the courtroom Friday, said he would also ask Trell about AEG's insurance claim, which he said his team recently discovered was filed with Lloyds of London on June 25, 2009, hours after Jackson was pronounced dead at UCLA Medical Center. That revelation may not relate to the heart of the wrongful death lawsuit against Michael Jackson's last concert promoter, but Jackson lawyers hope it could sway jurors to see AEG Live executives as motivated by money over the pop icon's needs. Wade Robson calls Michael Jackson 'a pedophile' A Lloyds of London underwriter later sued AEG, claiming the company failed to disclose information about the pop star's health and drug use. AEG dropped its claim for a $17.5 million insurance policy last year. Choreographer: AEG considered pulling plug on comeback . Jackson lawyers played video testimony of one of AEG's own expert witnesses Friday -- 25-year veteran tour manager Marty Hom. The opinion Hom submitted for AEG concluded he saw no red flags that should have alerted the promoter that something was wrong with Murray. He was asked if AEG Live should have realized something was wrong when Murray initially asked for $5 million a year to work as Jackson's personal physician. ""That raised a red flag because of the enormous sum of money,"" Hom testified. Hom acknowledged he had not seen many of the documents and depositions in the case, and AEG was considering him for a job as the Rolling Stones tour manager at the same time he was asked to testify.

"(CNN) -- With her glamorous looks and exceptional talent, Nigerian movie star Genevieve Nnaji is one of Africa's most successful actresses. The screen diva -- dubbed the Julia Roberts of Africa -- has starred in dozens of films, enchanting millions of movie fans across the continent. The 31-year-old actress is considered to be a poster girl for Nollywood, the booming Nigerian movie industry, which according to UNESCO, is the world's second-largest film producer after India's Bollywood. Nnaji has been performing in front of the camera from the age of 8. She is now one of Africa's most instantly recognizable faces and has won several accolades, including the 2005 African Academy Movie Award for Best Actress. CNN's Pedro Pinto caught up with Nnaji before her latest movie premiere in London to discuss fame and her passion for Nigeria. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: Do you see yourself as an ambassador for your country? Genevieve Nnaji: As long as you are a celebrity and in the public eye, you are an ambassador because you are the person they see -- they can't see the whole continent, they can't see the whole country. CNN: How would you describe Nigeria to people who've never been there? GN: Nigeria is a unique and a peculiar country, and as the people, we are too. CNN: Why peculiar? GN: Because everything, every aspect of human nature is in every Nigerian -- the good, the bad, the ugly, it's just like another New York. Nigeria is fun, to be honest. But when...all we have people talking about when it comes to Nigeria is crime and fraud and things...that's just a very very minute number of people. Nigerians on the whole are very confident people. I believe we are confident, I believe we are very resourceful and we are very hospitable when it comes to visitors in the country. CNN: When you look at your country, what are some of the things that you love about it? GN: I like that as Nigerians we have some sort of neighborly love that we don't understand. We have a way of coming to the rescue of complete strangers. We do have that bond and I think it has to do with our background and how we are raised....I would never live anywhere else to be honest, no. CNN: Really? GN: No, I grew up in Lagos, I was born and bred there and I don't see myself leaving that town any time soon. I can work anywhere else but in terms of living, I'm used to Lagos. CNN: How does it make you feel when people are screaming your name constantly? GN: You never get completely used to it, like the last time I was here for the other premiere -- ""Bursting Out"" -- it was pretty overwhelming. I just thought, is this my life, all these people actually loving and appreciating me for who I am? It's very humbling to be honest, I must say I'm blessed. CNN: When did you realize that maybe this could be your future, this could be your career? GN: I don't think I ever realized that, for a long time I kept thinking, OK, this is just temporary, definitely I'm going to go back to school and read law, English or something that I wanted to do. So I never fully accepted acting as my profession. I don't think I saw myself there but somehow...here we are, I am an actor. CNN: Do you ever get the feeling when you wake up in the morning one day that you wish you weren't famous? GN: Oh yes, I don't even need to wake up, just sitting down sometimes I'm like, God, sometimes I hate my life. But I can't complain. CNN: You have been referred to as the African Julia Roberts. When you hear that, what do you feel? GN: Thanks to Oprah (Winfrey), it's very, very flattering, I mean not just because I'm compared to (Roberts) but because of who compared me to her. So it's an honor to be honest but I think it's probably the vein we have on the forehead, I think that's what we have in common. CNN: What do you wish for your future, where do you see yourself? GN: I want to be further challenged in my career, I don't think I have reached my peak necessarily so I hope for other opportunities, greater opportunities to express myself. Mostly because there is still something inside of me that I just feel I haven't let out and it's really trying to come out and trying to burst loose so I'm hoping for that opportunity...I just want that story, that story that challenges me even further.","Nigerian actress Genevieve Nnaji is one of Africa's most recognizable faces .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- On ""The Daily Show,"" Jon Stewart captured the frustration that many of President Obama's supporters have felt over the past week as one scandal after another cascaded into the White House. After starting with a predictable riff accusing Bill O'Reilly of ignoring facts when attacking the Obama administration, Stewart turned to the IRS story, banged on his desk, and yelled out curses. Stewart then blasted the administration for the revelation that the IRS had given extra scrutiny to right-wing organizations. ""Explanation please,"" Stewart said, before playing some comedic clips of Lois Lerner, the official in charge of handling tax-exempt organizations at the IRS, who admits she is not good at math. ""Well, congratulations, President Barack Obama,"" Stewart went on to say. ""Conspiracy theorists, who generally can survive in anaerobic environments, have just had an algae bloom dropped on their f*****g heads. Thus removing the last arrow in your pro-governance quiver. ... This has, in one seismic moment, shifted the burden of proof from the tinfoil-behatted to the government."" Opinion: Will scandals stall Obama agenda? This was just one of the scandals to rock the administration within the week. The media also reported that the Justice Department had conducted a surveillance operation focusing on journalists for The Associated Press, in an effort to find the source behind a leaked story about a foiled terrorist attack. Many liberal Democrats were frustrated and shocked that the administration had permitted the seizure of the phone records, the kind of activities they would certainly have railed against had they happened under President George W. Bush. Although there is no evidence that Obama was involved in either of these incidents -- and many Republicans are clearly trying to use them to drum up a narrative about a scandal-ridden presidency -- the combination left many Democrats, like Stewart, scratching their heads, wondering what happened to the president who promised when he ran in 2008 to transform the way politics worked. Despite controversies, Obama approval rating holds steady . It is still too early to know all the facts and what the president's role has been. Nonetheless, some of the frustration that Obama's supporters feel comes from ways in which this White House has too often accepted politics as usual rather than embarking on the transformative changes that he once promised. While many of the president's supporters insist that he has delivered on his promise to push forward a bold policy agenda, few would say that he has fulfilled his goal of changing the way that politics works. What happened? Since the resignation of President Richard Nixon over Watergate, most presidential candidates have run on the promise to fix a broken Washington. Jimmy Carter, whose 1976 campaign revolved around the basic promise that you could trust him, perfected this message and style of campaigning. In one way or another, every candidate -- including Obama's predecessor, Bush -- has assured voters he would reform government and transform politics. But the change doesn't happen. Within four years, as Carter discovered, the new boss looks like the old boss and ""the system"" seems the same. Most presidents realize once they are in office that reforming Washington will consume too much of their political capital, generating more enemies among their opponents as well as within their own party, and the results of any such initiative will probably be negligible. Instead, once in office, presidents tend to embrace the role of politician and turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues that will matter much more to voters on Election Day. The easiest way to achieve policy goals is by working through the existing system rather than trying to remake things. Transformation is also difficult simply because the size and scale of the executive branch have grown so much over the past century, vastly increasing the odds that things can go wrong. Within each agency, there are multiple opportunities for unethical bureaucrats, sometimes without presidential knowledge, to do bad things. This is part of the reason there have been such strong advocates, on the right and the left, calling for greater -- though less politicized -- congressional oversight and tighter rules to constrain wrongdoing. Opinion: For Obama, it's no more Mr. Nice Media . In certain respects, the burden, as Stewart points out, is greater for liberals, given the centrality of government to their agenda. Over the past decades the vast expansion of executive power through the homeland security program has also increased the possibilities for wrongdoing. People should not be surprised that the Justice Department was so aggressive with the AP phone records. After all, Obama has kept most of Bush's homeland security program in place and has conducted an extraordinarily aggressive program to contain any leaks that threaten the system. In defense of the government's actions, Attorney General Eric Holder said the leak that it was investigating ""put the American people at risk."" Reforming government has also fallen victim to the hyperpartisan polarization that defines Washington. From day one in the White House, Obama has faced an incredibly hostile Republican Party, unwilling to support almost anything he does. This vastly diminished the incentives for him to try to find bipartisan support for reform initiatives, which usually generate a lot of opposition from interests who thrive in the status quo and are rarely priorities for voters on Election Day. With campaign finance, another area where Obama has greatly disappointed his supporters, Obama decided that the only way to beat the Republicans would be to raise and spend as much money as they did. That prompted his decision to turn down federal financing for his campaigns, bringing an end to the post-Watergate reforms, and leading to reliance on the Super PACs he once criticized. None of this is meant to excuse the kinds of activities that have recently been revealed. But Americans should not be surprised that the promise of reform vanished under Obama and that the problems of government he inherited have not gone away. Obama to new grads: 'No time for excuses' Ultimately, we will need politicians who are willing to take huge risks in tackling some of the underlying problems with government -- or a scandal so severe that it creates real political pressure for incumbents to do something -- if we are to strengthen our processes and reduce the risks of the kinds of stories we saw this past week. Scandals can prod elected officials to take reform seriously. Following Watergate, a scandal far worse than what we have seen thus far, Congress and the president adopted a number of major government reforms that included a new campaign finance system, ethics rules, the Office of the Independent Counsel, and much more. While Carter has been criticized for many of his failings on domestic and foreign policy, his decision to move forward with reforms in the wake of Watergate stands as one of his biggest achievements. Perhaps Obama should use this moment as an opportunity to be bold and to return to some of the fundamental ideas for reform that he raised in embarking on his journey to the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Jon Stewart expressed frustration of Obama supporters over IRS scandal .

"New York (CNN) -- A 21-year-old Hofstra University junior was fatally shot early Friday in an exchange of gunfire between a suspected home invader and police who came to the house, officials said. Andrea Rebello lived with her twin sister in an off-campus house in Uniondale, New York. A male suspect wearing a black ski mask forced his way into the residence, which the sisters shared with two other students, according to police. At some point during the night, the twins' female roommate was able to leave the home and call police, a Nassau County police spokesman told CNN on Friday. When police arrived, there was an exchange of gunfire that left Andrea and the suspect dead. Police say the source of the gunfire that killed Rebello is still under investigation. It was not immediately known whether the suspect knew the students. Armed robbery was believed to be the motive for the home invasion. Andrea's high school principal, Carol Conklin-Spillane, said the girls' home community in Westchester, New York, was heartbroken. She described Andrea as a fun-loving, personable and self-aware young woman. The sisters were a perfectly complemented ""match set."" ""There are twins who are just siblings and there are twins who are close, and then there was Andrea and Jessica,"" she said. ""They were best friends by choice."" Conklin-Spillane said while on her way to Sleepy Hollow High School in New York she heard a student had been killed. ""I remember saying to myself that some mother's heart will be broken today,"" she said. ""Never did I imagine it could be one of our community members."" Andrea's parents, Fernando and Nella Rebello, are closely tied to the Portuguese community, and always worked to create opportunities for their children, Conklin-Spillane said. The family was extremely close, she said. Friday was the last day of finals at Hofstra University, right before graduation weekend. The university said in a statement that the commencement ceremonies will go on as scheduled. Andrea Rebello was majoring in public relations. CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.","Home invasion occurs in Uniondale, New York .

"(CNN) -- In popular culture, butlers are usually portrayed as ""Made in Britain"" and tend to stately homes somewhere in the English countryside. The last few years has revealed a different reality, however. Increasingly, ""Jeeves"" and his ilk are as likely to be found managing a palace in Saudi Arabia as a manor in England. Anthony Seddon-Holland, the owner of the British Butler Guild, an elite butler training and staffing agency, estimates 25% of his placements end up in the Middle East. ""They like British servants more than anybody else, because I think they trust us,"" he concedes. ""A lot of wealthy Arabs -- especially the royals -- go to boarding schools and university in the UK. By the time they're in their 20s, they probably spent more time in England than their own country."" For someone like Seddon-Holland, a self-professed traditionalist (he balked when an American client once suggested he replace his tails with chinos), the Gulf states of the Middle East are keepers-of-the-flame for the glory days of service. Few British households hire the legions of staff depicted in Downton Abbey. Such retinues, however, are more commonplace in the Middle East. Steven Randolph, a butler who cut his teeth at Buckingham Palace before founding Randolphs, his own butler recruitment firm, remembers working for one prominent family from the region. ""We were at a property in Paris, and I was quite surprised the first time they had family visit. I looked out the window and counted 40 people lined up outside. This was for a family of two,"" he recalls. ""There are not many stately homes in London that would employ such a huge number of staff."" Randolph also notes that while butlers stationed in the Middle East can earn a decent income ($150,000 for a top earner), the hours tend to be longer. The region can also prove isolating. ""I worked in Saudi Arabia for some time, and you have to adjust yourself to the fact that you have no social life,"" says Seddon-Holland. ""You can't go out for a beer and meet women. It just doesn't happen in Saudi or Oman, or other countries in the area."" Still, he says, in many ways the nature of the work is less intense than in other parts of the world. ""I don't have to deal with drunks, or people whacked out on Prozac; I don't have problems with prostitutes or gambling. Those things are out the window in the Middle East. I worked for two royal families in strict Islamic countries, and the day was so stress-free, I can't describe it,"" he says. Even outside of royal circles, the style of service founded by the British remains popular. Several hotels in the region supply private butlers to every guest. According to Randolph, the demand for these hotel butlers has ""gone through the roof."" While private butlers remain fairly homogenous, in the hospitality industry, the demographic has changed considerably. As wealthy Chinese and Russian tourists flock to the region, hotels are clamoring to offer the standard of service these guests have come to expect, in a language they understand. As a result, the face of butler service in the region is often, unexpectedly, Chinese. ""Due to the rapid growth of tourists from China, we needed to ensure the high level of customer satisfaction and have a strategy,"" says Izabela Hamilton, a spokesperson at the Burj Al Arab Hotel, which employs 200 butlers -- none of them British. Hotel management makes regular recruitment trips to China, and all staff are encouraged to learn Mandarin. According to Sara Vestin Rahmani, director of butler agency Bespoke Bureau, and Peek-a-Boo, a sister placement firm for nannies, some families hire Chinese staff to give their children a headstart. ""People think, 'OK, a lot of stuff happening in the world will be in China,' and they want their kids to be ahead of the game, so they hire Mandarin-speaking nannies from us,"" she says. Despite a burgeoning supply from China and demand from the Middle East, Josephine Ive, who heads up Magnums Butlers and trains 600 Chinese service staff yearly, says her students are often hesitant to make the trip. ""Many Chinese parents are reluctant to let their offspring go to other countries. They prefer their young people to be chaperoned for safety,"" she says, adding that the Middle East's reputation for racial hierarchy doesn't help. Seddon-Holland, however, thinks the region offers enough perks to overcome most quibbles. ""Don't let what you see on Fox News shape your views,"" he says. ""If you keep an open mind, it can be a wonderful place to work.","British butlers sought after for wealthy in Middle East .

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- Whitney Houston went to church one last time Saturday. She was welcomed by family, friends and a virtual audience of millions who watched as the pop superstar was remembered as a child of God with the voice of an angel. A voice that never forgot its roots. ""Jesus Loves Me"" was the last song Houston sang in public before her death February 11 in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 48. So it was fitting that the mourners -- comforted and encouraged by the likes of Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys and R. Kelly -- heard the simple, but powerful, ""Jesus Loves Me,"" this time performed by CeCe Winans. Saturday's homegoing service was held at New Hope Baptist Church, where Houston, nicknamed ""Nippy,"" was soloing in the junior choir by age 11. Even with her ensuing fame, which brought six Grammy Awards, glamorous living and parties on the West Coast, and seven consecutive No. 1 singles, Houston never forgot her Newark, New Jersey, hometown. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred with Houston in her first movie, ""The Bodyguard,"" recounted how both of them grew up in the Baptist faith and had family members who sang in the choir. ""Church was our bond,"" Costner said. Houston, the actor said, overcame her doubts about having what it took to earn the role in ""The Bodyguard."" She alone, Costner said, was the right choice. ""Now you are gone, too soon, leaving us with memories of a little girl who stepped bravely in front of this church, in front of the ones that loved you first,"" Costner said. ""In front of the ones who loved you the best and loved you the longest. And boldly you stepped into the white hot light of the world's stage."" During the three-and-a-half-hour service, Houston's casket, covered with a large spray of flowers, rested in front of the altar. While many of her fans lamented the fact that Houston's service was invitation-only, Pastor Marvin Winans, who delivered the eulogy, thanked Cissy Houston, Whitney's mother, for having the service at New Hope. ""That took a lot of courage. And because of that you brought the world to church today,"" Winans said during his eulogy. The six-page funeral program contained color family photos and a letter from Cissy Houston. The letter included the message, ""God said 'It's time, Nippy. Your work is done.'"" It was signed, ""Thanks for being such a wonderful daughter. Love, Mommie."" Houston also left behind a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, 18. Through the tears and occasional laughter, performers and speakers spoke of Houston's loyalty. Gospel singer and longtime friend BeBe Winans was visibly emotional as he recalled a memory of Houston's sense of humor. With his sister, CeCe, by his side, he told the story of how Houston, then a major celebrity, informed them of her intent to sing background vocals on their new tour. When they told her she was too big a star to do that now, Houston responded, ""You're my brother and sister, right?"" The exchange went on for a few minutes and then Houston told them, ""Y'all broke, right? I'm rich, right? So I can buy what I want to for y'all."" Winans said that was the Whitney Houston he would remember. Then he sang, ""I Really Miss You."" A ""who's who"" of musical performers adapted lyrics in tribute to Houston. Gospel singer and friend Kim Burrell sang a reworked version of Sam Cooke's ""A Change is Gonna Come,"" adding glimpses of Houston's life to the lyrics. After finishing, she walked down to the pew where Cissy Houston sat and embraced her. One of the most emotional moments in the service came when Keys sang ""Send Me an Angel,"" her voice soaring into the rafters of the sanctuary. Oprah Winfrey, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Spike Lee, and Houston's former husband, Bobby Brown, were among those in attendance. Brown walked by Houston's casket with his head down before the service began. Police said Brown and his entourage later left the church during the service. At the time of her death, Houston was in the Los Angeles area for the 54th annual Grammy Awards and was to attend a party hosted by her longtime mentor and record producer, Clive Davis. She was discovered dead in her hotel suite. A cause of death has not been determined. Mourners heard only a few indirect references to her personal battles. A close family friend told CNN on Tuesday that Houston had not used ""hard drugs"" for several years. Investigators are examining prescription drugs found in her hotel room. Through her turmoil, speakers said, Houston remained true to her faith. ""In her final days, she held on to what you taught her to believe in,"" said Patricia Houston, Whitney's sister-in-law and former manager. ""I promise you she did."" Ray Watson, Houston's bodyguard, recalled some of his last interactions with the singer. ""In our final days, she came in my room and she began to speak biblically,"" he said. ""She laid her head on my shoulder and said, 'We are gonna be all right.' Speakers, including Bishop T.D. Jakes and director-producer Tyler Perry, spoke of the promise of tomorrow. ""Death has not won. Your tears may flow. The flowers might wither,"" Jakes said. ""You will find people you love may leave you outwardly, but (they) will not leave you inwardly."" At the conclusion of the service, Houston's iconic recording of ""I Will Always Love You"" was played as her coffin was removed from the sanctuary. Her mother leaned on her escorts as they helped her down the aisle. Houston will be laid to rest Sunday at the Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, just south of Newark. She has come home.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Emergency workers have recovered all 28 bodies from a collapsed tunnel at an underground mine training facility in Indonesia, the mining company said Wednesday. Another 10 people were rescued in the aftermath of the accident, which occurred on May 14 about 500 meters from the entrance of the Big Gossan Mine, according to PT Freeport Indonesia, which mines gold, copper and silver in the region. The Indonesian government said a tunnel roof collapsed after a landslide. The facility is in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua. PT Freeport has said mining operations, which ceased during the rescue and recovery operations, will remain suspended indefinitely. It says it will launch an independent investigation into the cause of the incident. ""With the recovery work completed we are now focusing on reviewing safety throughout our underground operations and in determining what caused the collapse. We will take all actions required to provide for the safety of our work force,"" said Richard Adkerson, President and CEO of Freeport. ""Our workforce has always been, and will continue to be, our top priority. Our goal in all our worldwide operations has been to reduce incidents and avoid fatalities.

Some police fired shots in the air and used water cannons, according to Haider Ali, a witness at the scene. Sharfuddin Memon, spokesman for Sindh Province, said the protesters numbered in the hundreds. There were several clashes between police and protesters, leaving some demonstrators injured, Memon said.

"(CNN) -- ""Warmly welcome Simon Cockerell David."" The colorful, electric sign was something of an unusual and unexpected greeting for Briton Simon Cockerell, 35, who this week embarked on a landmark visit to Sinuiju, North Korea's largest border town. Separated by a river from China's Dandong City and easily accessible from Dandong by car or train, Sinuiju has long been a popular North Korean destination for Chinese tourists but was pretty much off-limits to Western visitors until now. The most a Westerner could experience was the view from the train and station platform during transit from China to the secretive country. Cockerell is general manager of Beijing-based Koryo Tours -- one of the biggest tour companies specializing in North Korean travel. He says his visit was a result of 10 years of lobbying ""the right people"" on the local tourism ladder. ""We've been putting pressure on them for years, and we believed Sinuiju in particular would be easier to gain access to because of all the tourist infrastructure already in place, and because the people there are used to seeing foreign visitors,"" Cockerell told CNN. Koryo Tours guided approximately half of the 5,000 Western tourists to North Korea last year, the company says. Behind the veil: A rare look at life in North Korea . 'Broken Bridge' Following meetings with officials, Cockerell's sights included the local park, classic revolutionary monuments, mosaics, the railway station, a provincial revolutionary museum, a local kindergarten well known throughout the country, the riverside and a look at the ""Broken Bridge"" -- the old bridge to Dandong which was bombed during the Korean War. ""It's an interesting town and there's definitely a border town vibe,"" said Cockerell, adding that the Chinese influence from traders and businessmen who come to Sinuiju every day is very prevalent. Most of the international commercial trade with North Korea is said to pass through Sinuiju. However, that does not make it a rich town. ""It's not a very well-off place, especially compared to Pyongyang, which is the richest place in North Korea,"" said Cockerell. North Korea's 'hotel of doom' opening debacle continues . Cheaper trip . The tour company believes the different vibe of the town will make it a popular destination for Western visitors. The other draw is that it's a cheaper trip. ""Until now, you had to go in for a minimum of at least three days but Sinuiju can be a day trip as well as an add-on to other North Korea tours,"" said Gareth Johnson, 32, the founder of Young Pioneer Tours, a budget North Korean tour company for Westerners based in Xi'an, China. Young Pioneer Tours has also been lobbying for the Sinuiju opening for the past two years, and will be taking in a test tour group to the border town this Sunday. ""My personal opinion is that this came about because China stopped all Chinese tours to North Korea due to recent tensions,"" Johnson told CNN. How to travel to North Korea . Both tour companies are still waiting for pricing information from their local partner companies before they officially begin charging for Sinuiju day trips or tour add-ons. Restrictions still apply -- those with U.S. or Japanese passports cannot visit Sinuiju (journalists can't as tourists and visitors with South Korean passports can't enter North Korea at all). Living history . Some, including readers commenting on CNN articles, have described travel to North Korea as unethical, arguing it helps fund Pyongyang. Cockerell says he believes establishing human contact with the outside world is important for North Korean civilians. ""We believe that there is value in taking people there and raising awareness among the North Korean people of what the outside world is like by simple human level contact, which is sadly lacking,"" he said. And the appeal of North Korea to the Western tourist? For Johnson, that's a no-brainer. ""The world is getting very similar,"" said Johnson. ""Even in China there are so many streets where I look at the shops and I could be anywhere in the world."" ""North Korea is living history. Seeing something truly different. There's not as much adventure left in the world as we would like."" Koryo Tours, 27 Beisanlitun Nan, Chaoyang District, Beijing; +86 10 6416 7544 .

"(CNN) -- A right-wing historian and author killed himself inside the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris Tuesday in front of horrified tourists, police said. About 1,500 people at the cathedral were evacuated, CNN affiliate BFM reported. The site is one of the world's most prominent churches and a huge tourist attraction in the French capital. BFM identified the man as Dominique Venner, 78. Le Monde newspaper quoted a rector at the cathedral, who said the man placed a letter on the altar and then shot himself . On his blog, Venner has lashed out against same-sex marriage and what he called a future Islamist takeover of France. In a post published Tuesday, he wrote, ""The essence of a man is in his existence and not in another world. It's here and now that you have to play out your destiny until the last second. And this last second has as much importance as the rest of the life."" In the blog, Venner voiced his support for those expected to take part in a massive demonstration in Paris May 26 against same-sex marriage. But he said their fight should not be limited to that issue, and they must also denounce what he predicted would be the replacement of the French and European population with Muslims. ""There certainly have to be new actions, spectacular and symbolic, to shake up the sleepiness, to shake the numbed consciences and wake up the memory of our origins,"" the blog said. ""We're entering into a time when words must be authenticated by actions."" Right-wing politician Marine Le Pen tweeted about her ""respect"" for him.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The California man believed to be the maker of an anti-Islam film that ignited a firestorm in the Muslim world was cooperative when authorities escorted him to a voluntary interview, officials said Saturday. ""It was all choreographed,"" said Steve Whitmore of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. ""He was ready and willing and very cooperative."" The overnight meeting with a probation officer came a day after federal officials said they were reviewing the probation of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, who was convicted of bank fraud in 2010 and placed on supervised probation for five years. Clinton demands Arab Spring nations protect embassies . Federal officials consider Nakoula to be the filmmaker behind the anti-Islam ""Innocence of Muslims."" Whitmore told CNN that Nakoula left the local sheriff's station after the federal officials were done interviewing him. ""He is gone and he is free,"" he said of Nakoula, who was bundled up in a coat, hat and white scarf as he was escorted from his house. Nakoula decided to cover himself, Whitmore told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS. Whitmore earlier dismissed reports that Nakoula had been arrested, saying he was never in handcuffs or in custody. Karen Redmond, a spokeswoman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, said Friday that Nakoula's federal probation was under review. Redmond didn't provide details of why or when the probation review was initiated, or how long the process would take. While on probation, Nakoula can't access computers or any device that can access the Internet without approval from his probation officer. Nakoula served one year in federal prison at Lompoc, California, but officials couldn't immediately determine whether Nakoula paid any of the court-ordered restitution of $794,700, according to probation department officials and court records. Since notice of the film spread through YouTube, Nakoula has been out of public view and ensconced with his family in their home in Cerritos, California, where journalists have been gathered seeking information about his elusive background. Cerritos is about a 20-mile drive southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The movie, backed by hardcore anti-Islam groups in the United States, is a low-budget project that was ignored in the United States when trailers were posted on YouTube in July. But after Egyptian television aired certain segments, violent protests erupted in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories. Violent mobs attacked the U.S. Consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi, leaving the ambassador and three other American men dead. Navy SEALs among dead . The amateurish film portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, buffoon, ruthless killer and child molester. Islam categorically forbids any depictions of Mohammed, and blasphemy is an incendiary taboo in the Muslim world. The FBI contacted the filmmaker this week because of the potential for threats but he is not under investigation, a federal law enforcement official told CNN Thursday. One of the few public reports about Nakoula emerged this week when he called the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Wednesday night to report a disturbance, said Whitmore. Nakoula wanted local police to protect him. When news of his movie first broke, the filmmaker identified himself as Sam Bacile and told the Wall Street Journal that he was a 52-year-old Israeli-American real estate developer from California. He said Jewish donors had financed his film. But Israel's Foreign Ministry said there was no record of a Sam Bacile with Israeli citizenship. A production staff member who worked on the film in its initial stages told CNN that an entirely different name was filed on the paperwork for the Screen Actors Guild: Abenob Nakoula Bassely. A public records search showed an Abanob B. Nakoula residing at the same address as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. He believed the filmmaker was a Coptic Christian and when the two spoke on the phone during production, the filmmaker said he was in Alexandria, Egypt, raising money for the film. Staff and crew of film that ridiculed Muslims say they were 'grossly misled' In Egypt, tension has emerged in recent decades between Muslims and the minority Copts. Another staffer who worked on the film said he knew the producer as Sam Bassil. That's how he signed a personal check to pay staff. When CNN inquired about Sam Bassil, the U.S. Attorney's Office sent a copy of a 2009 indictment. Those court documents showed the bank fraud conviction for Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. In his interview with the Wall Street Journal, the filmmaker characterized his movie as ""a political effort to call attention to the hypocrisies of Islam."" ""Islam is a cancer,"" he said. ""The movie is a political movie. It's not a religious movie."" Have you witnessed attacks at U.S. embassies? Share your images, videos and stories.

"(CNN) -- Karley Marquet and Annie Kendzior said they enrolled at two of the nation's most prestigious military academies to serve their country and become military officers. Instead, they claim, they were raped -- and their military careers are now over. In a lawsuit filed in U.S. Federal Court on Friday, the women claim the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, and the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, ignored ""rampant sexual harassment."" The suit claims former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the former superintendents of the two academies and the current secretaries of the Army and Navy are ""personally responsible"" for failing to ""prevent rapes and sexual assaults at the Naval Academy and West Point."" Karley Marquet was a high school honor student, championship swimmer and all-star rugby player. She could have gone to college anywhere with her credentials, but Marquet chose West Point. ""When I was accepted, it was kind of overwhelming,"" she says. ""You can't imagine having that structure and discipline but at the same time having people look at you like, 'Wow, you're doing something great for our country.'"" But Marquet said her dream of becoming an officer was shattered in January 2011, her second semester at West Point. Marquet said she got sick over a holiday weekend and stayed behind on campus. Her roommate was out of town and she was alone in her room. It was then, Marquet, said, that an upperclassman she knew showed up at her door late one night to talk ""girl troubles."" ""I kind of felt cool that an upperclassman wanted to be friends with me and was seeking my advice,"" Marquet recalls. After a drink, Marquet said, he persuaded her to go to his room. ""I just remember getting more and more intoxicated and my judgment really started to become impaired. ... I remember him turning off the lights and me asking, 'What are you doing?' And then he proceeded to rape me."" Marquet said she woke up disoriented, in physical pain, afraid to come forward. ""I was scared it was going to ruin my career,"" she said, ""I was scared if I said anything, there would constantly be a target on my back."" According to the lawsuit, Marquet became depressed and suicidal ""as a result of the rape and hostile environment"" at West Point. She filed a report and requested an investigation. ""The reason I ended up telling someone is because I didn't want that to happen to anyone else,"" Marquet said tearfully. Annie Kendzior described herself as a ""girly-girl"" who never imagined she would end up in the military. Kendzior was also an all-star student and one of the best high school soccer players in the country. She was recruited by Ivy League schools to play soccer, but she said the Naval Academy was more convincing. ""All of their graduates from the soccer team went on and became pilots and Marine officers,"" Kendzior said. ""It just sounds like those women are so powerful and so well-respected, and I wanted to be that woman."" So in the fall of 2008, Kendzior headed off to Annapolis. She said her goal was to fly F-18s but it wasn't long after arriving at the academy she realized that wasn't going to happen. ""I could tell that there was a bias towards women,"" Kendzior recalled. ""You're a female entering into a fraternity. A giant frat."" During one of he first weekends at the academy, Kendzior was invited to a party off campus. ""I was like, 'OK, cool! College, finally! I can live the college life for one night."" But Kendzior said she had way too much to drink, so when a fellow midshipman offered her a place to crash, she accepted. ""I was like, 'OK, you know, it will be fine. I trust you. You're an upperclass,"" Kendzior remembers, ""Because that's what they teach you, to trust your upperclass."" But Kendzior says that didn't happen. She was raped. ""At one point in the middle of the night, I did come to and he was on top of me,"" Kendzior said. ""And I remember saying 'No,' but I just passed out again. Kendzior said, she too, was afraid to come forward. ""I didn't want to be the girl that got the athlete kicked out, We had been told stories about how that happened in the past and I didn't want to be that next story."" For the next two years Kendzior said she battled depression and thoughts of suicide. It was a secret she couldn't keep anymore. When she told her father what happened, he encouraged her to file a report and request an investigation. Marquet and Kendzior said they believed their cases were being investigated. Marquet remembered investigators meeting with her parents about her case. ""They promised my parents that if he wasn't going to jail, they could at least get him kicked out of West Point with the evidence they had,"" she said. But both women said their alleged perpetrators were never punished and are still in the military. Marquet and Kendzior are not alone. Reports of sexual assault at West Point, the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, are up nearly 60 percent, and according to the Department of Defense, of the 65 reports investigated, only one resulted in a court-martial. And it's that rise in reports of sexual assault that has the top man at the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, changing the rules. ""We've got to train commanders to understand that when these complaints are brought, they've got to do their damnedest to see that these people are brought to justice,"" Panetta told CNN's Kyra Phillips in an exclusive interview. Panetta could not comment on Marquet's and Kendzior's cases specifically because of privacy issues, but he made clear that blaming of the victim needs to stop. ""I think that's part of the syndrome that we're dealing with, which is that once a decision is made that somehow this prosecution is not going to move forward then you basically turn on the victim who brought that complaint,"" Panetta said. ""That syndrome is what we have to break out of."" Just last week, after the CNN interview, Panetta announced he has created a Special Victims Unit to investigate sexual assault allegations, and that sexual assault allegations will be dealt with at the level of colonel instead of slowly making their way up through the chain of command. But the changes in policy have come too late for Karley Marquet and Annie Kendzior. Their military careers are over. According to the lawsuit, ""as a result of the rape,"" Marquet became ""depressed and suicidal."" She said she was unable to handle the stress of seeing the alleged perpetrator every day, so she resigned from West Point. Kendzior said she also became suicidal. She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and according to her lawsuit, was then ""forced to leave the academy."" The two women said they are telling their stories so that others at the academies will feel comfortable coming forward. ""I know that with at least one person coming forward there will be others who want to come forward and say something,"" Marquet said. Similarly, Kendzior said, ""I want to encourage other women to report as soon as possible because then they might get their perpetrators put behind bars, which is where they should be, which is where they deserve to be."" West Point and the Naval Academy told CNN they were unable to comment on the allegations due to privacy issues. Both women have requested copies of their case files to learn more about why their alleged perpetrators are still in the military.","Suit names academies' superintendents, Army, Navy and former DoD secretaries .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- At 17, Sonali Mukherjee had everything going for her. She was a beautiful, intelligent and ambitious young woman, dedicated to excelling in her studies. She was president of the Student Union, captain of the National Cadet Corps and an honor student set to pursue a PhD in sociology despite her modest family background -- her father used to work as a security guard in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand and her mother was a housewife. ""I had seen my parents struggle for the most basic things, so I strived to achieve something big so that I could give my family a better life,"" she said. However, Mukherjee's life changed after three male students from her college started harassing her. She didn't respond to their advances, so they threatened to destroy her. At first, she wasn't intimidated. During her time in the cadet corps, an organization in all schools and colleges in India aimed at grooming students to join the military, Mukherjee had won several prizes for her shooting skills. On a hot summer day when Mukherjee was fast asleep on the roof of her house, the three men threw a jug of acid on her. For the first few seconds she was in shock and didn't know what had happened. ""All I could feel was this tremendous amount of pain, it was burning, like someone had thrown me into a fire,"" she tells CNN 10 years after the 2003 attack. In the fraction of a second it took for the acid to melt her face and part of her upper chest, Mukherjee lost her ability to see, hear, eat, walk and talk. Mukherjee, now 27, said she looked and felt like a corpse. ""I had hardly even lived my life, but that one incident changed the entire meaning of my life. It felt like the light had gone out all of a sudden, and darkness had surrounded me on all sides. I had no hope, I didn't know what to do,"" she says. Mukherjee's heartbroken grandfather died soon after and her mother fell into depression -- only her father remained resilient. ""I can't tell you how much it hurts me to see my daughter in this state but being the head of the family I couldn't afford to break down,"" Charan Das Mukherjee says. And with sheer willpower and determination both father and daughter continue their fight for justice and for recovery. ""I decided I don't want to die like this, or live like this. I decided I can't give up, I have to get better, I have to punish those guys and I have to support my family. I held my father's hand and crawled back to life."" Her father sold their family's ancestral land, gold and spent every penny of savings on her treatment -- she recently underwent her 27th reconstructive surgery. In 2012: Two children killed in Afghanistan acid attack . In 2012, Mukherjee decided to participate in the country's most popular game show -- the Indian edition of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" She took part because she needed the money and she wanted the world to know her plight as a victim of an acid attack. ""I've grown up watching your films and now I can't see you but I can feel you,"" she told host Amitabh Bachchan, who is also India's biggest superstar. She won the $40,000 jackpot, enabling her to move to the Indian capital, New Delhi, for better medical treatment. ""When she came to us she had 98% burns. She had no ears, no eyes, no eyelids, no nose, no lips, no scalp and no chest,"" said her doctor, BLK Hospital's Sanjeev Bagai. Bagai and his medical team have managed to reconstruct her lips, eyelids, nose, but the challenge now is to give her ""some kind of a normal face, somewhere close to what a normal human being would look like,"" he says. The men who scarred her for life were freed after just two years in jail. Mukherjee has appealed the court's decision but years on she's yet to get a date in court. ""My father spent every penny, hoping I would get justice. But in the end we lost everything, while the criminals are out there.""

"Guatemala City (CNN) -- When former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt was convicted of genocide and sentenced to 80 years in prison this month, it was not expected to be the end of story. READ MORE: Guatemala's Rios Montt guilty of genocide . Observers knew that an appeal was coming, but it was a separate action -- a ruling by Guatemala's Constitutional Court -- that provided the latest twist in the case. The Constitutional Court on Monday overturned Rios Montt's conviction and sentence, and ordered the proceedings to return to the trial phase. The ruling does not annul the entire trial, but everything that happened after April 19, notably the closing arguments and conviction. The overturning of the conviction is related to a number of procedural complaints filed by the defense. The defense had argued that Rios Montt's rights had been violated when his attorney was expelled early in the trial, and that the head judge should have recused herself. The Constitutional Court decided that the trial should have been suspended while these appeals were in place, instead of pushing forward a conclusion. Rios Montt, 86, had been found guilty of the genocide of more than 1,700 indigenous Ixil Mayans during his 1982-83 rule. The trial marked the first time a head of state was tried for genocide by his country's own judicial system. Dozens of Ixil Mayans took the stand during the trial to recount atrocities committed by the army. The witnesses told the judges about brutal killings, rapes and the razing of villages. The Constitutional Court's ruling allows their testimony to stand. The trial's original outcome was seen as a precedent for future charges against military officials accused of atrocities during Guatemala's 36-year civil war. The war did not end until 1996, leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees. Rios Montt said during the trial that he never ordered the killings of the Ixil. ""We have reached the conclusion that there is still hope for justice, which is the Constitutional Court,"" Rios Montt attorney Mario Antonio Rossell said. ""This is a historic resolution."" Human rights groups say they will appeal the decision. ""What has happened is that in this country, the laws have been applied arbitrarily,"" said Mario Polanco, director of a Guatemalan human rights group. ""They have served the interests of those in power, and when it is one of the representatives of those in power who is on trial, they will resort to any means, and that is what we are seeing. I think there has been an abuse in the interpretation of the law."" READ MORE: Rios Montt rejects genocide charges as history-making trial nears end . READ MORE: Guatemala confronts a dark chapter .

"(CNN) -- Four more cases of hantavirus have been reported among people who visited Yosemite National Park in California, bringing the total number of cases to six, the California Department of Public Health said Thursday. Two of the six people infected have died. The health department is ""working closely with the National Park Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further investigate the cluster of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome cases in Yosemite and reduce the risk of other visitors becoming ill from this virus,"" said Dr. Ron Chapman, health department director. Those infected visited the park between early June and mid-July, the health department said. Most stayed at the park's popular Curry Village ""tent cabins."" Yosemite closed the tent cabins indefinitely on Tuesday. The park sent letters to around 1,700 summer visitors on Monday and Tuesday, explaining that hantavirus cases had been uncovered and that visitors should see their doctors if symptoms surface, park spokesman Scott Gediman said. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a rare lung disease that kills about a third of those who get infected. Symptoms can include fever, muscle aches and fatigue, though it is not communicable from person to person. Yosemite advises medical help for those with hantavirus symptoms . ""However, if the individual is experiencing fever and fatigue, and has a history of potential rural rodent exposure, together with shortness of breath, (that) would be strongly suggestive of HPS,"" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In September 2010, the Tuolumne Meadows Lodge at Yosemite was assessed for hantavirus risk by the health department and received a rating of ""high risk"" for hantavirus activity. The evaluator made a number of recommendations to decrease the risk. CNN was unable to determine what, if any, action the park took on the recommendations. The lodge is not in the same area of the park as Curry Village. In the United States, the carriers of hantavirus are deer mice, cotton rats, rice rats and white-footed mice. The virus can be present in the rodents' urine, droppings and saliva, and it is spread to people when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus, the CDC says. Don Neubacher, Yosemite's superintendent, said that people typically don't fall ill with hantavirus until between one and six weeks after they are exposed. ""The health of our visitors is our paramount concern, and we are making every effort to notify and inform our visitors of any potential illness,"" Neubacher said. Officials have focused on deer mice, common in the high-elevation eastern Sierra Nevada region. The mice are gray or brown on top, with white bellies. Their ears have no fur. ""Rodents can infest a whole range of these structures,"" said Dr. Vicki Kramer, chief of the health department's vector-borne disease section. ""Deer mice can get in a hole one-quarter inch in diameter."" In addition to cleaning the 400 camp structures, park officials have said they have increased routine measures to reduce the hantavirus risk. ""You cannot eliminate all the mice,"" Kramer said. ""There are a lot of people and snacks that people bring into their tents or cabins."" Before this year, Yosemite National Park saw one hantavirus case each in 2000 and 2010. There is no specific treatment for a hantavirus infection, according to the CDC, but the earlier a patient is brought to intensive care, the better. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report .","Six Yosemite visitors have been infected; two have died .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian public notary Claudia do Nascimento Domingues set off a firestorm by granting Brazil's first civil union to a trio, an act so unprecedented that there isn't a word for it in Portuguese. Uniao poliafetiva is the label she created. ""Polyfidelitous union"" is her best guess in English. The relationship involves three professionals in their 30s -- one man and two women -- who, she says, live together, love one another as equals and are like any other non-married cohabiting couple -- except they are three. What Domingues did was legally register the trio as a ""stable union,"" a civil union that extends all of the benefits of marriage, though there is debate about what rights the threesome will actually enjoy. In short, it recognizes the trio as a family entity for public legal purposes. Domingues has not released the identities of the three. But not all are embracing the unique alliance. ""This union is void of any legality,"" said Regina Beatriz Tavares da Silva, head of the family law committee of a lawyers' association in Sao Paulo. Brazilian law defines marriage as a union between two people, so it is impossible for a civil union of three to be granted the rights of a marriage of two. ""It goes directly against the constitution,"" da Silva said. ""Monogamy is defined as relations between two, not three or four or five."" The first-of-its-kind civil union has led to an outcry from religious groups, too. Those who fear the ""slipperly slope"" feel the ground moving underneath their feet. ""The institution of family cannot be defended with the approval of actions that seek to distort its definition,"" the religious, conservative Plinio Correa de Oliveira Institute said in a statement. ""The purpose of this (union) is not to build families, but to destroy them."" The controversial civil union ""is proof that there is a plurality of familiar relations, though not all deserve judicial or legal standing,"" Rolf Madaleno, director of the Brazilian Institute for Family Law, said in a statement. ""The action carried out does not provide protections and does not confer rights."" In his opinion, the legal action in question does nothing more than reaffirm that the trio in question believes that they are a trio. Domingues, 39, argues that they deserve some benefits. They live together in Rio de Janeiro, they share a bank account, and they want protection in case of separation or death, she said. Brazil is known for its progressive social policies and openness, as reflected in the status conferred to the trio, though the country is stereotyped, too. While Brazil appears to be a permissive place, it is also a a country where more than 86% of the population identifies as Catholic or evangelical. There was a similar outcry when ""stable unions"" between same-sex couples were allowed for the first time. The country's supreme court ruled that a gay couple in a civil union had the same rights as a married heterosexual couple, but there is debate about whether such rights can be extended to a trio. But to Domingues, a public notary in the city of Tupa in Sao Paulo state, there is nothing preventing nontraditional relationships from being granted ""stable union"" status. The trio considers themselves a family and is entitled to be seen as such in the public record, Domingues said. ""By registering them, I only confirmed that they recognize themselves as a family,"" she said. ""I don't confer rights to them. That is up to a judge to decide."" The civil union was actually granted three months ago, but news of it only spread this week. Da Silva called the civil union ""deceitful,"" a runaround to grant status to a polygamous relationship. Such relationships aren't new; they just haven't been recognized, Domingues said. She says that she simply put her stamp of approval on a relationship that was surfing on a wave of cultural currents, but it was no coincidence that the request landed on her desk. The trio from Rio, having been rejected by other public notaries, found their way rural Sao Paulo state and to Domingues because she is a student of polyfidelitous relationships -- ones involving more than two partners, but where there is fidelity between the members. Formerly an IT manager, Domingues now is a doctoral student at the University of Sao Paulo, studying family law. Her dissertation, she said, is about ""how you can love more than one person at the same time."" Her research looks at cultures, places, sociology, anthropology, religion and the history of family and intimate relationships in Brazil. Through mutual friends, the trio found Domingues and traveled more than 600 miles from Rio, into the interior of Sao Paulo state, to Tupa. Domingues doesn't hesitate to call herself married, though she and her husband are bound by a ""stable union"" and not a civil marriage. Her husband works with her as a deputy public notary. ""We have had all the reactions you can imagine,"" she said. Other polyfidelitous groups have reached out to her seeking the same civil union status. Domingues is studying the cases of a quintet (two men and three women) and another trio (one woman and two men).","In Brazil, a notary has granted a civil union to unite a man and two women .
The public notary who approved the status says they have the right to be a family .
Others say it is a violation of the constitution and destroys families .
The notary is now studying unions for another trio and for a quintet ."
"(CNN) -- Many a modern president has lost momentum and suffered what are termed ""scandals"" in his second term. President Barack Obama's current problems are part of that tradition. But with the exception of Richard Nixon, scandals have not proven fatal. Indeed, Ronald Reagan's Iran-Contra scandal and Bill Clinton's impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky affair were far more serious than what we know so far about Obama's involvement in Benghazi, the Internal Revenue Service or subpoenas of records of reporters' calls. Yet Reagan and Clinton finished their second terms as popular presidents. America's founding fathers created a system of government deliberately designed to protect liberties rather than be efficient. They feared giving the chief executive too much power and constrained the president with checks and balances to limit his actions. As one wag put it, the system ensured that King George III could not rule over us, nor for that matter, could anyone else. One partial exception was foreign policy, where the inherent powers of the commander-in-chief give the president somewhat more constitutional leeway than in domestic policy. According to conventional wisdom, this situation leads lame duck, second-term presidents to turn their attention to foreign policy where they have a better chance of creating a second-term legacy. But it's not that simple. Much of a president's second term depends upon unpredictable external events. For example, during his first term, Woodrow Wilson made every effort to stay out of World War I, and he won re-election in 1916 on that promise. But within six months, Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and meddling in Mexico led Wilson to send American troops to fight in Europe -- an enormous departure from the U.S. tradition of avoiding conflicts outside the Western Hemisphere. And after 1938, Franklin Roosevelt decided that Hitler posed a threat to the United States, but he was unable to convince an isolationist American public to enter World War II until the Japanese solved his problem by attacking Pearl Harbor at the end of 1941. Reagan's case is also instructive. His tough rhetoric toward the Soviet Union was the hallmark of his first term, and he won a massive re-election victory in 1984. Yet in 1985, after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, Reagan had the intuition and emotional intelligence to recognize at their first summit in Geneva that Gorbachev -- unlike the inept Soviet leaders that preceded him -- was a man with whom he could do business. The real success of Reagan's foreign policy was not the tough talk, but the ability to cash in on it by reaching deals that were the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Yet ironically, Reagan almost lost his presidency and his place in history because of careless management that allowed his subordinates to transfer arms for hostages in Iran and use the proceeds to violate congressional laws against providing funds to the Contra rebels in Central America. Obama's first term was marked by the passage of health care legislation -- unpopular with some, but a historic accomplishment that Democratic presidents have sought since the days of Harry Truman. The Democrats' loss of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections has constrained Obama's ability to advance other transformational efforts on the domestic front, though some believe that, out of self-interest, the Republican Party may still allow bipartisan reform of immigration law during Obama's second term. The current ""scandals"" certainly are expensive to Obama in terms of daily distraction and lost political momentum, but if you think you can write off the rest of the Obama presidency, think again. Too often, Washington focuses so myopically on daily political battles that it fails to pay attention to history. The lessons of history tell us: It is too soon to write off Barack Obama. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joseph Nye.","Joseph Nye: Many presidents lose momentum with second-term scandals .
So some try foreign policy, where constitution gives more chance to make legacy, he says .
Nye: Wilson, FDR, others found external events can upend plans for foreign policy legacy .
Nye: If you're writing off Obama's second term, you're not paying attention to history's lessons ."
"(CNN) -- Two of the richest organizations in sport announced Tuesday that they have partnered to buy a Major League Soccer franchise in New York. English Premier League side Manchester City will be the majority owner with MLB giants New York Yankees also claiming a stake in the team -- which will be named New York City FC (NYCFC). The MLS currently has 19 clubs -- including the New York Bulls -- with NYCFC looking to join the league for the 2015 season. ""This is a transformational development that will elevate the league to new heights in this country,"" said MLS Commissioner Don Garber. ""The New York area is home to more than 19 million people -- and we look forward to an intense crosstown rivalry between New York City Football Club and the New York Red Bulls that will captivate this great city,"" he added. Abu-Dhabi owned Manchester City will take the lead on recruiting the management team, staff and players for the new franchise, which will be on the hunt for a permanent home in the Big Apple -- with the Flushing Meadows area of Queens identified as a possible location. ""New York is a legendary sports town, as well as a thriving global city with a rapidly expanding soccer fan-base,"" Ferran Soriano, the Chief Executive Officer of Manchester City said. City, who saw their own cross city rivals Manchester United wrest the EPL title from them this season, have already expanded their activities in the United States by setting up community programs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. They have an existing marketing deal with 27-time World Series champion Yankees and the Manchester City squad will be in New York to play a friendly against fellow EPL giants Chelsea at the Yankee Stadium Saturday. ""We are pleased to be associated with this major move by MLS to increase its presence in the New York market,"" said Hal Steinbrenner, managing general partner of the Yankees. Steinbrenner said they wanted to work with City to ""create something very special for the soccer fans of New York."" The Red Bulls, who are owned by the soft drinks company bearing that name, have recruited the likes of former Arsenal, Barcelona and French international star Thierry Henry and have a growing fan base. Watch video: Henry enjoys life at the Bulls . They have a purpose built stadium in New Jersey, while the New York Cosmos have also reformed and will join the second-tier of the MLS later this year. In the 1970s the Cosmos boasted a legendary line-up which included Brazil's Pele and former German international captain Franz Beckenbauer. They even played for two seasons at the Yankee Stadium but they folded in 1984 -- the same year the then North American Soccer League (NASL) collapsed. Since the formation of the MLS in 1996, football has enjoyed steady growth in the United States -- boosted by the arrival of David Beckham to Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. Beckham, who helped Galaxy to the MLS championship for the past two seasons, retired after a brief spell with Paris Saint-Germain and is reported to want to set up his own franchise in the league.","New York City FC to become 20th club in Major League Soccer .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Want a sign of economic hope? Look to a place where the housing collapse began: Phoenix, Arizona. ""We're talking about (home) prices being 3 to 4% higher than last year, which most people don't believe because they're used to bad news,"" said Mike Orr, director of Arizona State University's Center of Real Estate Theory and Practice. Orr's new report on the Phoenix market shows a direct reverse of the situation that sparked a massive housing bubble. Monthly foreclosure starts have fallen 49% since a year ago. Home sales are up 8%. The result? What had been a market with far more housing supply than demand has now become a place where buyers have to act fast and beat out heavy competition. CNN Radio's Lisa Desjardins reports on the turnaround in Phoenix . ""It's no longer difficult to sell your house here,"" Orr told CNN Radio. ""If you price it at market, it well sell quickly. The supply situation is unusually low."" Supply is down some 42%, Orr estimates, from September 2008. Top 10 turnaround towns . That is a dramatic turnaround for an area that once had a massive supply glut. According to Orr's predecessor at ASU, Jay Butler, during the recession foreclosures hit an eye-popping 12% of the homes in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. But now Orr's report indicates that supply has been soaked up and Phoenix is again becoming a seller's market where buyers must stand in line and move fast. ""(The listing) came out on the market on a Friday morning. We looked at it Friday afternoon and put a bid on it Friday night,"" said homeowner Tim Woodward of his new house. He and his fiancÃ©, Susan Rust, are combining their two families, which includes five teenage girls who will all live at home. ""So we need space,"" Rust said. She and Woodward had already lost bids on other homes and decided to put in a contract on what would become their home while sitting in the driveway after their walk-through. ""According to the neighbors, there were 11 other couples who went through this house,"" Rust said. ""So you have to be quick."" BofA to slash mortgage balances by $100,000 or more . Rust and Woodward got their five-bedroom, three-bath house in Tempe for $290,000, 40% less than the asking price a few years ago. But neither the homeowners nor the experts think buyers are getting bargains anymore. They believe prices have already passed their low point, hit their natural floor and are rising again. This is not the housing market of a year, or even eight months ago. ""It's getting very, very tough to find a real bargain nowadays,"" said Mark Stapp, a Phoenix real estate developer who also teaches at the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at ASU's Carey School of Business. The classic bargains, foreclosures and bank-owned properties, are drying up. According to Orr's new report, the number of homes reverting to lenders in the Phoenix area is down 62% since January 2011. Trustee sales of foreclosed properties are down 42%. ""The market has tightened up substantially,"" Stapp said. ""In fact, I know of investors coming to town and leaving very disappointed because they thought they'd find huge bargains and they can't find them."" The question is, will this trend last? Orr, a self-professed data addict, says the numbers indicate a fundamental shift in the market. ""If there is a major economic crisis that we haven't foreseen, things can go back to square one,"" he said. ""But this is not just a slight trend. This is something I see as being very significant. And it's starting to accelerate."" Follow on Twitter: @LisaDCNN . CNN's Susanna Capeluto and Dan Szematowicz contributed to this story.","Phoenix housing market turning around, report indicates .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The masked henchmen grabbed three fingers on each of the Syrian political cartoonist's hands and pulled them back all the way -- so far that they cracked. ""Break his arms so that he doesn't ever draw again,"" one said. Ali Ferzat -- the cartoonist who described the 2011 attack to me in a recent interview -- soon found himself bleeding and left for dead near the Damascus airport. His assailants, who he believes were acting on behalf of the Syrian regime, dragged him alongside a moving car. His head and shoulder bounced on the pavement and then the men shoved him out of the vehicle, dumping him on the side of the road. Ferzat wondered if he would live, let alone draw again. It would be months before he would learn the second answer. Before I'd heard these and the other horrifying details of this attack against one of the Arab world's most notable artists, I asked Ferzat -- an Arab-Santa-looking character with a smile that could cheer up Tilda Swinton -- if he was sure his hands were broken to stop him from drawing cartoons critical of Syria's leader, Bashar al-Assad. His answer made me laugh. ""Obviously,"" he said. ""What do I look like to you, a chef?"" I met Ferzat in at the Oslo Freedom Forum, a gathering of dissidents and human rights activists, where he received the Vaclav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent. Being in his presence was the human-rights nerd version of a basketball fan meeting LeBron. But what impressed me most about Ferzat is that he's maintained his wit and cheer despite the darkness that has fallen on him and on his country, which is in the grips of an intractable two-year war that's killed an estimated 80,000 people. He is almost naively optimistic about Syria's future. And it's infectious. The rest of Syria's opposition should take note. As his story shows, the true strength of a revolution is in its ideas -- in nonviolent actions such as drawing truth to power. Dictators do have reason to be scared of cartoons. That's why Ferzat's hands became some of the most feared objects in Syria. ""They came after me,"" he said. ""Obviously (cartooning) has power."" The self-taught artist, who's in his early 60s, has been using them to mock authority since he was a young boy -- first imitating cartoons he admired and then creating satire of his own. He went pro in the 1970s, gaining notoriety for publishing cartoons domestically and internationally. Back then, before the current war, Ferzat never dared to depict specific people in his cartoons. He drew autocrats and dictators, but they never looked like real, identifiable people. He did it to avoid censorship or retaliation. But that was before the war -- before reports emerged, in May 2011, that a 13-year-old had been tortured and killed in Daraa, Syria. Stories like those of Hamza Ali al-Khateeb's death, which reportedly involved his genitals being mutilated, pushed Ferzat across a threshold. He started to draw exact likeness of al-Assad in his satire. Enough was enough. His pen would hold no punches. Ferzat drew al-Assad standing on the side of the road with his thumb in the air, ready to hitchhike out of Syria. A crazed Moammar Gadhafi, who was still alive at the time but later would be killed in Libya's uprising, was driving a getaway car. The message was clear: Syria's leader had to go. That was the image, he told me, that led to his attack on August 25, 2011. Ferzat's animated demeanor -- his eyebrows bounce when he talks and his hands, now unbandaged, gesture wildly -- flattened as he told me the story. That day, a white car with darkly tinted windows followed him out of the studio before dawn. He's been working there by candlelight to avoid detection. Frightened by the car, he drove to the center of Damascus, to a square he knew to be home to government buildings and the president's palace. The car followed and crashed into him at the square, he said, forcing him stop. Three men emerged and yanked off the doors of Ferzat's car. They pulled him from it, beat him with crowd-control batons and then yanked plastic handcuffs around his wrists. ""They handcuffed me so tightly I felt that one of my wrists was going to break,"" he said. SANA, the Syrian state news agency, reported Ferzat ""was attacked by veiled people"" and that ""authorities concerned are conducting an investigation."" My e-mail requesting further information, however, was not responded to. And the U.S. State Department condemned the attack, saying in a statement that the al-Assad regime was sending ""a clear message that (Ferzat) should stop drawing."" They beat him so badly that his vision failed for days in one eye, Farzat told me, and he could barely see out of the other. Confused, Ferzat asked what was happening to him. ""Don't you ever dare to cross your bosses and to cross your leaders, because Bashar al-Assad's shoe is on your face and on your head."" (For evidence of the severity of that insult, recall the Bush and Ahmadinejad shoe-throwing incidents). They drove 30 minutes to a road near the Damascus airport. That's where they threw him from the car. ""My white shirt was completely, totally, red from the blood,"" he said. He thought he surely would bleed to death there. Cars wouldn't stop, perhaps afraid to pick up a person targeted by the regime or by police. But then the first of three miracles happened: A truck's tire burst, forcing it to stop exactly in front of Ferzat. ""This is like something out of a freakin' movie,"" Amir Ahmad Nasr, a blogger-author friend who was translating the conversation from Arabic, said to me. Ferzat threw himself into the bed of the pickup and begged the three men who drove it to take him back to the city. They agreed to drop him at the gates of Damascus, but wouldn't take him further -- definitely not to a hospital -- for fear of being targeted themselves. Still bleeding and barely able to see because of the beatings to his head, Ferzat wandered up to a house and asked its guard for help. Then the second miracle: The guard agreed to give him a ride to a nearby clinic, where (here's the third) doctors recognized the cartoonist and were sympathetic to his cause. They treated him at his house to avoid detection. But there was always the worry: his hands. Would he draw again? ""My hands became stuck like this,"" he told me, tensing up his digits into a wooden, claw-like shape. ""The doctors told me I needed to get treatment overseas."" Fate, again, would intervene. Using a newspaper contact in Kuwait, Ferzat arranged to leave Syria and seek treatment in a hospital there. After six months of surgery and physical therapy, he was able to put pen to paper. The first cartoon he created after the attack was not diluted by fear. He drew al-Assad and Russia's Vladimir Putin walking side by side, their legs intertwined to make the shape of a Nazi swastika. Ferzat is still living in exile. But the revolution needs him. It needs his art. He's seen images of protesters and rebels carrying printouts of his drawings. So he contributes art from outside the country. The outcome of the war in Syria is anything but sure. But talk to Ferzat and his optimism will rub off on you. He's convinced he will live and draw in Syria again -- that people in his country, a cradle of civilization that invented one of the world's first alphabets, are no longer afraid and eventually will triumph over the regime that would crush their spirits and their art. After hearing his story, I'm hard-pressed not to believe him. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Syrian political cartoonist details 2011 attack in which his hands were broken .

"(CNN) -- Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti announced his retirement Thursday, a month after a devastating crash in Houston, where he suffered head and spinal injuries. In a statement released through his team, Target Chip Ganassi Racing, Franchitti said he made the decision to stop racing based on the advice of doctors who have treated and assessed his injuries. ""They have made it very clear that the risks involved in further racing are too great and could be detrimental to my long term well-being. Based on this medical advice, I have no choice but to stop,"" he said. ""Racing has been my life for over 30 years and it's really tough to think that the driving side is now over. I was really looking forward to the 2014 season with Target Chip Ganassi Racing, with a goal of winning a fourth Indianapolis 500 and a fifth IndyCar Series championship."" Franchitti suffered a concussion in the wreck as well as fractures to his spine and ankle. The wreck occurred in the last lap of IndyCar's Grand Prix of Houston on October 6, when Japanese driver Takuma Sato bumped Franchitti's car, sending it airborne into the protective fencing.

"(CNN) -- When FIFA named Qatar as the host nation for the 2022 World Cup finals, it vindicated the gulf nation's continued determination to become one of the key players in the realm of sport by using its considerable economic resources. The decision by world football's governing body was not met with widespread approval. Traditionalists argued that the kingdom, with a population of just 1.85 million of which only 300,000 are Qatari citizens, had never qualified for a World Cup finals and had no discernible history in the sport. Yet the power and influence generated by the oil-rich nation swung the vote Qatar's way and, in 10 years' time, football's showpiece tournament will be played in an Arab country for the first time since its inception in 1930. The Qatari influence in sport is growing year by year and, by the time 2022 is upon us, the portfolio of sporting franchises and sporting events owned by the nation will undoubtedly be even more impressive than it is today. In football, Qataris own Spanish club Malaga and French giants Paris Saint-Germain. They also host major events in tennis, golf and cycling and are one of the five bidders to host the 2020 Olympic Games, as well as establishing the Aspire sports academy, one of the most prestigious facilities of its kind in the world. But why are Qataris so heavily involved in the sporting world? And what do they hope to achieve? ""When Qatar discovered their huge gas reserves they invested millions in sport, raising their worldwide profile by buying athletes and footballers and giving them Qatari citizenship,"" Middle East football expert James Montague, author of the book ""When Friday Comes -- Football In the Warzone,"" told CNN. ""Several Uruguayan players were paid lots of money to switch countries, but this proved a disaster with the national team still failing to qualify for the 2006 World Cup finals,. ""That didn't work, so the next way to qualify was to actually host the tournament and raise their profile by buying football clubs. Now they are spending billions on its infrastructure to ensure Qatar is synonymous with sporting and football excellence."" Sheikh Saoud Bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, secretary general of Qatar's Olympic Committee, offers an insight into why the nation, and its ruling royal family, is such a major force in the sporting world. ""Sport has huge power and, for a nation like Qatar that has such widespread diversities, in many ways it can put us on the world map,"" he told CNN's Future Cities show. ""When you organize a big event it brings people from all over the world into your country, and with that comes an exchanging of cultures and a lot of media coverage. ""Sports tourism is also a massive business at the moment. In Qatar we are organizing more than 30 events a year and the economy being generated on the back of these events is massive."" Another Qatari-owned organization is TV channel Al Jazeera. Since its launch in 1996 as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite station, the channel has expanded rapidly over the years and has now become a serious bidder in the TV sports rights market. This was illustrated at the end of last year when it outbid French pay-TV operator Canal Plus to screen UEFA Champions League matches exclusively in France for the next three years. Having also won the rights to show French domestic league football from next season, allied to the ownership of Ligue 1 title challengers PSG, it is clear that Qatar now has a huge presence in that country. Football journalist Julien Laurens says Qatar's influence in French football, and PSG in particular, is not necessarily a good thing. ""The Qatari influence in French football is massive at the moment, although it does seem to create a conflict of interest as they own the biggest club as well as also owning the TV rights to the league that club plays in,"" he told CNN. ""There is no doubt that a revolution is currently taking place within the French game, but the Qataris have been lured to PSG by the glamor and prestige of the capital city and there is a danger that the league could become all about that one team for many years to come."" Laurens added: ""We didn't expect PSG to dominate things so quickly but they are already splashing the cash, which is creating a huge gap between them and the rest of the clubs. ""It was easy for them to take over a French club and lead them to the top straight away, it would not have been as easy in England, Spain or Italy."" Although Qatari businessmen now have a strong foothold in French and Spanish football, they remain without a key base in the English Premier League, which boasts the highest attendance figures in European football. However, according to Montague, that situation might change in the near future, with a massive English institution firmly on Qatar's radar. And there is a near precedent following the 2008 takeover of Manchester City by an Abu Dhabi consortium. ""The Qatari Investment Authority have been sniffing around Manchester United for a long time,"" Montague said. ""I have had conversations in Qatar with prominent people and they have told me that United would fit their profile of wanting to use sport in general, and football in particular, to raise their profile to that of a world power. ""The Glazer family, who currently own United, will sell because they will get a better price from the Qataris. It isn't just a numbers or profit thing with the QIA, they want the institution that United stand for."" It remains to be seen whether United, or indeed any other many English club, comes under Qatari ownership in the near future but, with a World Cup and possible Olympic Games both on the horizon, the tiny gulf state is only going to grow in sporting stature and importance over the next decade.","Qatar is becoming a major player in the world of sport and sport finance .

"(CNN) -- Health officials said Wednesday that they've sent warnings to Yosemite National Park visitors from 39 other countries about a potentially deadly hantavirus uncovered at some of the park's cabins this summer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said up to 10,000 people were at risk, after estimating the number of friends and family members of those who stayed with visitors who booked reservations at the cabins. ""All guests who made reservations to stay in the 'Signature Tent Cabins' from June 10 through August 24, 2012 (approximately 2,900 persons) were e-mailed or mailed a health advisory urging them to seek immediate medical attention if they or other persons in their party exhibit symptoms of HPS,"" or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the CDC reported last week. The 'Signature Tent Cabins' are located at the park's popular Curry Village. Six cases of hantavirus have been reported at Yosemite, the California Department of Public Health said last week. Two of those infected died. Four more cases of hantavirus confirmed among Yosemite visitors . The syndrome is a rare lung disease that kills about a third of those infected. Symptoms can include fever, chills, cough, headaches, gastrointestinal problems, muscle aches and fatigue, though it is not communicable from person to person. The incubation period is typically two to four weeks after exposure, with a range of a few days up to six weeks. In the United States, the carriers of hantavirus are deer mice, cotton rats, rice rats and white-footed mice. The virus can be present in the rodents' urine, droppings and saliva, and it is spread to people when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus, the CDC says. Before this year, Yosemite National Park saw one hantavirus case each in 2000 and 2010. There is no specific treatment for a hantavirus infection, according to the CDC, but the earlier a patient is brought to intensive care, the better.

"(CNN) -- Newspaper photography and photojournalism make up a craft unlike any other in journalism. A frozen moment can convey human strength or weakness like few other story forms. An image created by a photojournalist carries the power to change societies. Great images remain burned into our brains forever. Journalists like to say that newspapers write the first draft of history, but that's only partly true -- the best news photos are history. The Chicago Sun-Times nurtured great photographers since the paper was founded. In fact, in an early Page One nameplate, the paper called itself ""The Picture Newspaper"" and carried the icon of a professional camera. But on Thursday morning, May 30, that illustrious era ended when the paper's editor dismissed 28 photojournalists with just a few words. How did they respond? They captured the grief and horror and emotion with their reporter's notebooks -- their cameras. I was lucky enough to work with these pros during my four years as a visual editor at the paper and saw the extraordinary lengths they went to, and risks they took, to make powerful Page One photos or in-depth photo reportage for investigative projects, such as the legendary ""Clout On Wheels"" series. My fellow editors pushed them hard every day to bring the best pictures to our readers. A photojournalist knows how hard it is to record history when the authorities try to limit or prevent you from doing so. But these guys could get anywhere, they knew everybody, and they had the uncanny ability to somehow be in the right place when news broke. Their instincts are legendary. Sun-Times photographers ran toward chaos, they placed themselves and their cameras as close as possible to the action without fail. I looked up to them. I wanted to be one of them. My first moments as a journalist were as a news photographer for my college newspaper, The Daily Eastern News, 25 years ago. I wanted to be a shooter at the Sun-Times because that was a place that valued the power of hard news photography. Photographer John White, who won a Pulitzer Prize at the newspaper in 1982, famously said, ""It is a privilege to be a photojournalist."" And it is an extraordinary privilege. White told me a few years ago that he enjoys being the eyes to the world and bringing the eyes of the world to what he has seen. Watch: John White talks about video story telling . Media watchers have noted that the Sun-Times' new publisher, Timothy P. Knight, had committed a similar mass firing of all news photographers at Newsday in 2008. Knight is using his power to crush a guild-protected workforce in favor of freelance talent. Freelancers and staff reporters will carry the burden of creating original news images from places where it's hard to take great pictures. The freelancers, presumably, will be carrying professional camera gear, while the reporters will be trained how to do double duty by using smartphones for visual news gathering and video packages. Smartphones replace point and shoot cameras, they replace consumer-level video cams, they replace pro audio recorders. But smartphones can't replace digital single lens reflex cameras -- and especially can't replace the talent and experience required to make pictures for many types of newspaper assignments. I have filed video reports from student protests in Rome with a smartphone, and I have reported in stills with Nikon F3s and ""fast glass,"" or fast lenses, from disaster scenes. The tools evolve, but they all have their own applications and abilities. The demands for print reproduction quality are much higher than for digital, so it is an open question how much of this new smartphone photography will actually be good enough to make it to the print editions. When I train journalists to tell visual stories with smartphones, their output is meant for digital audiences and is an adjunct to the work of the dedicated pros carrying better gear. But at the end of the day, quality storytelling matters, regardless of the form or who does the work. News consumers expect high quality when they pay for professional journalism from a Chicago brand that built its reputation on stellar news photography. White's work hangs in a private art gallery in the newsroom of the Sun-Times. It joins a collection more than 150 powerful news photographs that the photo staff of the paper produced over six decades -- a reminder for the employees who still work there of what their paper once stood for and accomplished. It is a shame that the public can't see this museum-quality exhibit. It is a breathtaking tour through Chicago's history seen through the eyes of some very brave witnesses. The photos are there, but the brave witnesses will no longer be in the building. So, what's been lost? A tradition of fearlessness, bravery, courage, knowledge and trust that was decades in the making. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robb Montgomery.","Chicago Sun-Times fired its whole photography staff of 28 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The many league tables which rank MBA programs vary in their methodology, but mainly share a few assumptions, including that a prime mark of quality is a stream of graduates entering highly-paid jobs in financial services and consulting. The cuddlier side of business: More MBAs are taking in environmental factors. However, one MBA table, the latest version of which has just been released, factors in some entirely different considerations, namely how well the programs incorporate wider social and environmental issues into their teaching. Beyond Gray Pinstripes, the ""alternative"" MBA top 100, is produced every two years by the Aspen Institute Center for Business Education (CBE) in Colorado, drawn from studies of nearly 600 full-time MBA programs worldwide. These days, almost all business schools have ""at least a beachhead"" of environmental and social awareness, according to Rich Leimsider, director of the CBE, although the extent of this varies greatly. The issue is an important one, he says: ""It matters what the senior executives of companies do, say and think. ""If you can change business education to include an appreciation for the social and environmental context you wind up with leaders who are really good at creating value all around."" Overall, however, the issue is being taken more and more seriously -- while in 2001, little more than a third of schools surveyed required students take a course examining the wider issues of business and society, in this year's survey it has risen to 63%. Perhaps unexpectedly, the research shows that such courses are not inevitably housed within a dedicated department of ethics or corporate social responsibility. In fact, such departments are only the fifth-most popular home for social or environmental courses, behind those of management, marketing, strategy and finance. Despite the differences, the Beyond Gray Pinstripes table is topped by a familiar big hitter -- Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, also in the number one slot for the last such survey in 2005. Stanford, which offers MBA students more than 30 elective courses on subjects such as ethics, social responsibility and the environment, says it views the leadership of an organization as ""a noble and critical pursuit"". This approach now includes a new joint MBA in the environment and resources, as well as a course in which business and engineering students join up to solve problems -- one project this year came up with the idea of cheap and easy-to-power LED lights for those without mains electricity. The U.S. dominates the top 10, with one Canadian school -- York University's Schulich School of Business -- in third, and Spain's well known Instituto de Empresa in 10th. Schools are themselves seeing the need for this new type of business education. Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, ranked art 26 in the Beyond Gray Pinstripes table, is planning a link up with the university's environmental school to study sustainable business. ""What we're seeing at Duke, and we're seeing this probably everywhere, is the business community now has reached a point where they recognize that to be globally competitive, you have to have an understanding of the risks and the opportunities that natural environments pose for firms,"" says Michael Lenox, associate professor of business.

""I was with her in the corridor and saw that Prince Charles had left some toast on the tray.

Auctioneer Charles Hanson said he believes the souvenir could fetch up to Â£500 ($778) when it goes on the block Thursday. ""If only the toast could talk,"" he said.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Anger over a film that denigrates the Prophet Mohammed spread to Yemen, where four protesters died Thursday during clashes with security forces outside the U.S. Embassy, according to Yemeni security officials. Twenty-four security force members were reported injured, as were 11 protesters, according to Yemen's Defense Ministry, security officials and eyewitnesses. Protesters and witnesses said one protester was critically injured when police fired on them as they tried to disperse the angry crowd. The protests in Sanaa are the latest to roil the Middle East over the online release of the film produced in the United States. As evening came, the number of protesters dwindled and tensions began to ease, after a day in which demonstrators breached a security wall and stormed the embassy amid escalating anti-American sentiment. No embassy personnel were harmed, U.S. officials said. In Egypt, riot police fired warning shots and tear gas early Thursday outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to keep hundreds of protesters back from the compound walls, with minor injuries reported. Protesters also gathered in Tunisia, Morocco, Iran and elsewhere. The clashes follow Tuesday's attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other consular officials dead and has heightened tensions at U.S. diplomatic missions across the region. Six things to know about the attack . Thursday morning, several thousand Yemeni protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, with some flooding the security perimeter and penetrating the embassy's wall, according to a statement released by Yemen through its embassy in Washington condemning the incident. ""Security services have quickly restored order to the embassy's complex. Fortunately, no casualties were reported from this chaotic incident,"" it said. However, after a lull following the breach of the embassy wall, anger appeared to rise again as the day wore on, and security forces began to use more force to try to control the crowd. U.S. increases embassy security worldwide after Libya attack . There were fewer than 100 protesters by lunchtime, and tensions had eased, but their numbers rose to several hundred after water cannons were used against the crowd. Security forces were given permission to shoot anyone seen with weapons near the embassy, two Interior Ministry officials told CNN, and gunshots were heard in the area. By evening, the protesters, armed only with sticks and stones picked up from the street, had decreased in number and had been pushed back to about 300 yards from the embassy. The protesters burned tires and an embassy flag, and smashed cars outside the embassy. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that all U.S. Embassy personnel were safe and accounted for and that the United States was doing all it could to protect them. The Yemeni government sent additional security personnel, he said. A U.S. official in Yemen, who was not authorized to speak publicly because of the sensitivity of the situation, earlier told CNN: ""Everyone here is OK."" He said there had been no evacuation. Demonstrators said they wanted to express their anger about the obscure movie after hearing of the protests in Libya and Egypt, although it was unclear how many of them have seen the offending video. Yemeni human rights activist Ala'a Jarban, who was not part of the protest but watched events from a nearby rooftop, told CNN he thought what had happened was ""really wrong."" ""There were calls on social media to protest today in front of the embassy, so I expected there might be some violence and clashes, but didn't expect it would be that easy to break into the embassy,"" he said. Ambassador's killing shines light on Muslim sensitivities around Prophet Mohammed . ""I've been there -- it's one of the most protected places in Yemen. To break in that easily was a shock to me."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the video Thursday as ""disgusting and reprehensible"" but said there was no justification for responding with violence. ""It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against diplomatic missions,"" she said. ""These are places whose very purpose is peaceful, to promote better understanding across countries and cultures."" In a statement released through the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi apologized to his U.S. counterpart, Barack Obama, and the American people for the attack on their mission in Sanaa. Hadi ordered Yemeni authorities to ""conduct an expeditious and thorough investigation"" and said the protest was the work of a ""rowdy group."" His statement, which spoke of ""warm relations"" between his country and the United States, said divisions among Yemeni security and military forces helped create an atmosphere where such disturbances could erupt. Over the past several months, Hadi has sought to restructure Yemeni security forces and remove loyalists to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh from their posts. Saleh was forced from power early this year after mass protests. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton condemned ""in the strongest terms"" the breaching of the perimeter wall and expressed the EU's ""full solidarity"" with the United States. Of the attack, the U.N. Security Council said that ""terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation ..."" An emergency message on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa warns of the possibility of further protests in the coming days, particularly near the embassy, and urges Americans to leave the country. Reaction to anti-Islam film fuels debate on free speech vs. hate speech . ""As staffing levels at the Embassy are restricted, our ability to assist U.S. citizens in an emergency remains limited and may be further constrained by the fluid security situation."" David Hartwell of security analysis group IHS Jane's told CNN the current protests were reminiscent in some ways of the outpouring of anger in 2005 after the publication in Denmark of cartoons seen as disrespectful to Mohammed. The violence also reflects the changed dynamic in the region following the Arab Spring, Hartwell said. ""You've got populations in all of these countries who are now much more willing to take to the streets and are much more wiling to vocalize their anger in a much more violent way,"" he said. ""My guess is that this outpouring of anger will be intense but brief, but I think there is a danger that this anger will spread to perhaps more unpredictable places like Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Staff and crew of film that ridiculed Muslims say they were ""grossly misled"" CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom, Elise Labott and Becky Brittain, and journalist Hakim Almasmari in Sanaa contributed to this report.","Four killed in protests, Yemen security officials say .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Robert Menendez slammed accusations that he had paid a Dominican woman for sex and expressed hope Tuesday that those behind the claims would be exposed in the wake of the woman's notarized confession that she'd never even met the New Jersey Democrat. ""I hope that you will all vigorously go after who was the source and purpose as you did go after the story at the time,"" he told reporters. In a notarized statement filed in court, Nexis de los Santos Santana said she was filmed without her knowledge when she claimed that Menendez had paid her to have sex. ""I am the person in the video, that is me, and those are my words, but this statement is not true,"" Santana said in the statement. ""I never agreed to be recorded."" In addition to criticism over accepting unreported plane flights and allegedly advocating on behalf of a business, Menendez was accused of partying with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic -- accusations he said were ""unsubstantiated."" As he did when the claims first emerged, Menendez said Tuesday the claims are ""false smears"" lifted from right-wing blogs ahead of the election. Menendez faces scrutiny over ties to Florida doctor . ""Look, I don't know more than what I have read. But I do know from the very beginning I have said that nameless, faceless, anonymous sources ... from the right wing blogs took this story which was just false smears right before an election cycle, attempted to do it then, and ultimately drove it into the mainstream press,"" he said. ""But they were never anything other than false smears."" The confession document was presented at a press conference Monday by lawyer Vinicio Castillo, who said Santana was recruited to make the claims against Menendez by another lawyer, Dr. Miguel Galvan. Galvan, in a notarized confession, pins the blame on a third lawyer, who Galvan said asked him to assist in a divorce case by finding ""witnesses"" to claim they had sex for money with Menendez. CNN has attempted to reach both the lawyers who allegedly recorded the escort making the claims against Menendez, but has not yet received a response. Questions revolve around his relationship with Salomon Melgen, the Florida man who owned a plane Menendez admits having flown three times -- once on official Senate business, and twice for personal reasons -- to the Dominican Republic in 2010. Melgen, his wife, Flor, and his daughter, Melissa, have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years. Castillo is Melgen's cousin and spokesman. In January, Menendez paid approximately $58,500 to Melgen for the flights he took in 2010, chalking up the lapse in payment to his busy schedule. On Tuesday, Menendez answered questions about intervening on issues on Melgen's behalf by saying, ""we raise questions all the time for a wide range of universe on public policy issues and we think that those are all legitimate."" A law enforcement official said last week the FBI was continuing to ""pursue all leads"" surrounding the Menendez allegations, including the prostitution charges. The same law enforcement source said federal agents had gone to the Dominican Republic in hopes of finding the women who claimed to have had sex with Menendez, but that the women had not yet been located. The Daily Caller, a conservative website, originally published the video with two women claiming they had sex with Menendez for money. In an article published Tuesday, the Daily Caller said Santana was not one of the two women who were featured in the video, though Santana asserted in the notarized court document she was one of the women. In her statement Monday, Santana said she was told she would be paid well for reading the script. Both she and Galvan requested legal protection in making their confessions.

"(CNN) -- The online realm is replete with a vast cornucopia of information, just waiting to provide the hungry masses with nourishing nuggets of knowledge -- or (as in ""The Hunger Games"") scary-ass weapons of mass destruction. So it baffles us to no end that instead of delving deep into said cornucopia and feasting on the kernels so lavished there when faced with a quandary, folks instead click on over to Twitter or Facebook and type missives akin to: ""Der, der, der what day is Christmas this year?"" We understand the urge to crowdsource when, say, you want to decide whether to cut off all your hair/paint your bedroom blue/get a full-body tattoo so as to resemble a Care Bear. All of those questions are open-ended, subjective and worthy of a response (such as, ""Hell no! Go for Pedo Bear instead!). But asking the masses something that you could have easily looked up yourself is just plain lazy, especially when said query makes you look like a full-on idiot. Moreover, your idiocy -- since it has been showcased in a public place -- does not just serve to amuse and horrify your friends. No! With the advent of such tools as Open Book and resources like Lamebook and Buzzfeed, your utter mouth-breathing-ness has the ability to get the entire world wondering: How the hell do we continue to exist on this Earth when such stunning displays of dullness walk freely among us? Read on for three examples of when people should have just Googled it. Who is Osama Bin Laden? After al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011, confused folks started flooding Twitter and other social sites, posing such queries as: ""Who is Osama Bin Laden and why should I care?"" For some reason, we don't think 140 characters is going to be enough to suss out that question. To their credit, the most perplexed parties (younger folks who were barely cognizant beings on 9/11) took to search engines as well, according to Yahoo News. Still, the parade of blithe tweets (""Is he in a band?"") are now forever stowed away in the Library of Congress like oh-so-embarrassing yearbook pictures -- only much, much worse. Who is Arcade Fire? The music world thrives and subsists on snobbery, you guys. The ability to sneer, snort and say, ""Ha, yeah, you wouldn't have heard of this band. They only have, like, one EP and it's not even on Spotify."" Sadly, you all provided this symposium of snobs with even more grist for the you're-an-idiot mill when, following the Arcade Fire's Grammy win last year, you took to the Web to cry: ""Who is Arcade Fire?"" Or worse yet: ""Who are the Suburbs?"" There's now an entire Tumblr -- and T-shirts! -- documenting your utter lack of musical knowledge. A Tumblr AND T-Shirts, you guys... We're not saying you have to listen to Arcade Fire -- I mean, ""The Suburbs"" was sooooo 2010, anyway. Just ... you know ... a little knowledge of their influences, coupled with some light delving into their back catalog would have really lent credence to your assertion that: ""JUSTIN BIEBER -- MY SWEET, SWEET LOVE -- WAS ROBBED! WHO DA HELL IS THE ARCADE FLAMMEMMEM?"" What is SOAP? Last week, Wikipedia went dark for one day in protest of SOPA (The Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (Protect IP Act), two (now tabled) bills in Congress designed to stop illegal copying and sharing of intellectual property online. Sites like Wikipedia see such acts as restrictive of online freedom, and in protest, staged mass, one-day blackouts of service. Wikipedia blacked out everything but the articles on SOPA and PIPA. Enter: The enraged masses. As documented by the genius Twitter aggregation account, @herpderpedia, folks fell to their knees and cried to the heavens (metaphorically -- we hope), bemoaning the loss of that, their own source of news and information (sarcasm). They beat their chests (again, we hope metaphorically) wondering why, oh why ""Soap"" (""WTF is SOAP?!"") would take away their beloved friend. Apparently, no one was looking up ""SOPA"" on Wikipedia. Or, you know, on CNN.","After Bin Laden was killed, people tweeted, ""Who is Osama Bin Laden?""

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- A U.S. surveillance ship violated Chinese and international laws during patrols more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) off the Chinese coast over the weekend, China's state-run media reported Tuesday. The Navy says this photo shows two Chinese trawlers forcing the Impeccable to make an emergency stop. ""China has lodged serious representations with the United States, as the USNS Impeccable conducted activities in China's special economic zone in the South China Sea,"" said Ma Zhaoxu, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman. ""We demand that the United States put an immediate stop to related activities and take effective measures to prevent similar acts from happening."" The response follows the Pentagon's contention Monday that Chinese ships harassed the U.S. vessel on Sunday in the latest of several instances of ""increasingly aggressive conduct"" in the past week. During the incident, five Chinese vessels ""shadowed and aggressively maneuvered in dangerously close proximity to USNS Impeccable, in an apparent coordinated effort to harass the U.S. ocean surveillance ship while it was conducting routine operations in international waters,"" the Pentagon said in a statement. Ma said that ""the U.S. claims are gravely in contravention of the facts and confuse black and white and they are totally unacceptable to China,"" although he didn't say what China's version of the events were. According to the Pentagon, the Chinese crew members aboard the vessels, two of which were within 50 feet, waved Chinese flags and told the U.S. ship to leave the area. ""Because the vessels' intentions were not known, Impeccable sprayed its fire hoses at one of the vessels in order to protect itself,"" the Pentagon's statement said. ""The Chinese crew members disrobed to their underwear and continued closing to within 25 feet.""  Watch CNN's Chris Lawrence report on the incident » . After the Impeccable alerted the Chinese ships ""in a friendly manner"" that it was seeking a safe path to depart the area, two of the Chinese ships stopped ""directly ahead of USNS Impeccable, forcing Impeccable to conduct an emergency 'all stop' in order to avoid collision,"" the statement said. ""They dropped pieces of wood in the water directly in front of Impeccable's path."" A Pentagon spokesman called the incident ""one of the most aggressive actions we've seen in some time. We will certainly let Chinese officials know of our displeasure at this reckless and dangerous maneuver."" He said the Chinese crew members used poles to try to snag the Impeccable's acoustic equipment in the water. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing lodged a protest over the weekend with the Chinese government, a State Department spokesman said Monday. The Impeccable's crew members are primarily civilians, and the ship is not armed, the spokesman said. The 281.5-foot Impeccable is one of six surveillance ships that perform military survey operations, according to the Navy. It is an oceanographic ship that gathers underwater acoustic data, using sonar. It has a maximum speed of 13 knots -- or about 15 mph -- but it travels 3 knots, or 3.5 mph, when towing its array of monitoring equipment. It carries a crew of 20 mariners, five technicians and as many as 20 Navy personnel. The Chinese ships involved included a navy intelligence collection ship, a Bureau of Maritime Fisheries patrol vessel, a State Oceanographic Administration patrol vessel and two small Chinese-flagged trawlers, the statement said. The Pentagon cited three previous instances of what it described as harassment, the first of which occurred last Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- ""Losers"" or victims of a framing? With officials seeking possible motives for the men who stand accused of the Boston marathon bombings, a picture is emerging from those who should have known Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and his brother, 19-year-old Dzhokar, best -- their family members. As a nation grieves over the three people killed in the bombings, the scores injured and a police officer who lost his life during the search for suspects, members of the Tsarnaev family have gone on record to express their feelings about the possible guilt or innocence of the pair. This is what they had to say: . The mother . Zubeidat Tsarnaeva says it is ""impossible, impossible"" for her sons to have committed such a crime. Speaking from the Russian region of Dagestan, she expressed support for her children and said she believes they have been the victims of a setup. ""You tell me, my son never would keep it in secret,"" she said. ""... If there is anyone who would be knowing it would be me. (Tamerlan) never would hide it from me."" The family matriarch also said no one talked about terrorism in their household. Her oldest son had had contact with the FBI before, she said. ""They knew what my son was doing, what actions and what sites (on) the Internet he was going,"" she said. ""How could this happen?"" Boston suspects: Immigrant dream to American nightmare . The father . ""Someone framed them,"" Anzor Tsarnaev said while the manhunt was being conducted. ""I don't know who exactly did it, but someone did."" He said he had spoken with his sons on Thursday and they told him, ""Everything is good, Daddy. Everything is very good."" After being told by ABC News on Friday that his youngest son had been captured alive, the elder Tsarnaev reportedly began to weep and had this message for his child: ""Tell police everything. Everything. Just be honest."" On Saturday, he told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh that he planned to travel to the United States. ""My kids never did anything -- that's it,"" he said. The sister . Alina Tsarnaeva told The (Newark, New Jersey) Star-Ledger that she had not seen her brothers ""in a long time"" but spoke lovingly of Tamerlan. ""He was a great person,"" she said. ""I thought I knew him. I never would have expected that from him. He is a kind and loving man. The cops took his life away just the same way he took others' lives away, if that's even true. At the end of the day, no one knows the truth."" Analysis: Older suspect grew increasingly religious . An uncle . After the death of Tamerlan and as authorities continued to hunt his younger brother, their uncle Ruslan Tsarni spoke passionately at a news conference Friday outside his Montgomery County, Maryland, home. ""Being losers, hatred to those who were able to settle themselves -- these are the only reasons I can imagine,"" Tsarni said when asked to speculate on a possible motive. ""Anything else, anything else to do with religion, with Islam, is a fraud, is a fake."" The uncle admonished the pair for putting ""a shame on our entire family -- the Tsarnaev family -- and you put a shame on the entire Chechen ethnicity."" By Saturday, he appeared to have a bit of a change of heart, telling CNN's Shannon Travis that he was angry when he spoke Friday. He said he was still in a ""state of shock"" but expressed happiness that his younger nephew had been captured alive and said his elder nephew had fallen prey to outside influences, according to a family acquaintance. ""(The acquaintance) said there is someone who brainwashed him, some new convert to Islam,'' Tsarni said. ""I would like to stress (the acquaintance was) of Armenian descent.'' An unidentified relative in Dagestan told ABC News that Tamerlan had worried family members a year ago during a trip there and had been asked to leave an uncle's home because of his ""increasingly extremist views."" An aunt . Tsarni was not the only one who passionately spoke about the Tsarnaev brothers. Maret Tsarnaev said she believed the picture of the bombing suspects that purportedly helped lead authorities to her nephews was ""staged."" ""If somebody wants to convince me, show me evidence,"" she said, telling reporters Friday she is studying to become a lawyer. ""Evidence! Evidence!"" At times seeming almost combative during a press conference, she said it would take much more than photos to convince her that her nephews had committed such a crime. ""What I'm saying is, why FBI does not give me more?"" FBI agents interviewed older suspect in 2011 . The wife . Katherine Russell is the 24-year-old wife of Tamerlan Tsarnaev and mother of their 3-year-old daughter, Zahara. Approached by Britain's Daily Mail at her family's home in New Hampshire, she declined to comment. Her family released the following statement Friday: . ""Our daughter has lost her husband today, the father of her child. We cannot begin to comprehend how this horrible tragedy occurred. In the aftermath of the Patriots' Day horror, we know that we never really knew Tamerlane Tsarnaev. Our hearts are sickened by the knowledge of the horror he has inflicted. Please respect our family's privacy in this difficult time.""","The family members of the bombing suspects are speaking out .

"(CNN) -- A year that began with a fourth Australian Open title ended in similarly triumphant style for Novak Djokovic on Monday as the Serb outclassed Rafael Nadal in the ATP World Tour Finals finale. The stunning straight-sets 6-3 6-4 victory over the world no.1 ensured the Serb finished the season with a flourish, claiming four titles in a row and complete a run of 22 matches unbeaten since losing to Nadal in the U.S. Open final in September. ""I've had a great 2013 season and this is the best possible way to crown all the achievements that I had,"" Djokovic told CNN's Amanda Davies. Read more: Djokovic canters to ATP Finals glory . ""This has been the best tennis (I've played) in the whole of 2013. And winning against the world No.1 Nadal, who has had the best year out of all the players, in straight sets could not be better,"" Djokovic added. ""I didn't expect myself to play as well as I did in the last two-and-a-half months after that painful loss in the U.S. Open final."" The four-set defeat to the Spaniard at Flushing Meadows and, in particular, the semi-final loss at the French Open last June, were hard to take says Djokovic. ""I played well in those matches but he just got the best out of me in the important moments,"" added the Serb. ""Mentally, I didn't keep my composure, my calmness. When you play a top rival, a few points decide a winner and it can shift from one side to the other in a split second,"" he said. ""I did have my doubts after that and had some ups and downs. But I managed to get stronger and had that necessary experience to understand what I need to get better, to get stronger and to have this willpower that keeps me going. ""I've managed to regroup to analyze what I've done wrong and work on that with my team and we had a great improvement in the last two months."" The recent run of victories ranks second only to the incredible 41-match winning streak he achieved in 2011, though Djokovic happily conceded Nadal is a worthy world No. 1 right now. Read more: Djokovic and Troicki slam 'ridiculous' procedures . ""I have to say he deserves to end up as No. 1 because he won two grand slams and has played incredible tennis on hard courts this season. (It's) not his preferred surface in the past few years, but he has improved and won so many matches,"" Djokovic said. ""For me, it's just important to keep on winning, to keep on getting as many titles as I can and I know the rankings and results will follow."" While Nadal's own remarkable season is at an end, Djokovic has one more mountain to climb as he attempts to lead Serbia to Davis Cup glory against Czech Republic in Belgrade this weekend. The 26-year-old says that the international team tournament might lack the kudos it once enjoyed, but he's still desperate to add a second title to the one Serbia clinched against France in 2010 before gearing up for more individual glory next year. ""Representing your country is very rare in our sport and a very unique opportunity for us to win another title at home,"" he says. ""This can serve as a great platform for 2014 season. I'm extra motivated and inspired to work and get myself, first of all, rested and recovered in the off season, and then work on my game and get ready for Australian Open.""","World No. 2 reflects on latest season-ending success with CNN's Amanda Davies .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Lauryn Hill pleaded guilty in a New Jersey courtroom on Friday to evading federal taxes on $1.8 million earned between 2005 and 2007, the Associated Press reports. The singer faces a maximum one-year sentence for each of the three counts. Hill declined to speak after the hearing, but her attorney, Nathan Hochman, indicated that she plans on paying back the taxes owed. U.S. Magistrate Michael Shipp agreed to delay the sentencing from early October to late November in order to give Hill time to make payment. When Shipp asked Hill if anyone had directly or indirectly influenced her decision to plead guilty, Hill gave an enigmatic response that seemed to promise a future statement: ""Indirectly, I've been advised my ability to speak out directly is for another time, at sentencing."" The income on which Hill did not pay taxes -- $818,000 collected in 2005, $222,000 in 2006 and $761,000 in 2007 -- was earned by four corporations that she owns. Charges were brought against Hill earlier this month, after which the singer took to Tumblr to address her side of the situation but focused on her time outside of the spotlight: ""During this period of crisis, much was said about me both slanted and inaccurate, by those who had become dependent on my creative force, yet unwilling to fully acknowledge the importance of my contribution, nor compensate me equitably for it."" Hill added in the post that she felt her ""potential to work"" was in danger and thus said, ""I did whatever needed to be done in order to insulate my family from the climate of hostility, false entitlement, manipulation, racial prejudice, sexism and ageism that I was surrounded by. ""There were no exotic trips,"" she continued, ""no fleet of cars, just an all out war for safety, integrity, wholeness and health, without mistreatment, denial, and/or exploitation.""

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer kept his hopes alive at the ATP World Tour Finals Thursday with a straight sets win over Richard Gasquet then repeated his demand for more rigorous doping controls in tennis. ""I just feel like we're not getting maybe tested enough,"" said Federer after completing a 6-4 6-3 win over his French opponent. ""I feel like I used to get tested more, I think I was tested 25 times in 2003, 2004. Ever since, I think it's been clearly going down this season. ""Also last year when I won Dubai, Rotterdam and Indian Wells, and the year before that, I didn't get tested in one of those three events that I won. For me, that's not okay. ""You show up and test a guy that's winning everything. That's sometimes what I struggle with. ""But overall I trust the system. I think they're all very professional,"" the 17-time grand slam champion told gathered reporters. Drug testing has been a hot topic all week at the end of season showpiece in London, with World No.2 Novak Djokovic mounting an outspoken defense of his Serbian colleague Viktor Troicki and saying he had lost faith in the anti-doping regime. By contrast, Federer said he had little sympathy for Troicki, who saw his original ban cut from 18 months to 12 months Tuesday. Troicki failed to provide a blood sample after feeling unwell at the Monte Carlo Masters but claimed he had been given permission by the doping control doctor to come back the next day. ""I do believe that when you are requested for a sample, you have to give the sample. It doesn't matter how bad you feel. I'm sorry,"" Federer said. ""Like the test the next day for me is not a test any more because of what could have happened overnight. ""I believe whatever they decided on. I think it's just very important to give the sample when you're requested to give it because there you are in front of them and there is no way to escape. That's where we just need to be extremely firm."" Djokovic later beat Juan Martin Del Potro 6-3 3-6 6-3 in another tight three set match at the O2 Arena to book his passage into the semifinals. It was his 19th straight win since losing to Rafael Nadal in the final of the U.S. Open and kept him on course in his title defense in London. Defeat for Del Potro also boosted Federer's hopes of reaching the last four in a tournament he has won six times.

"(CNN) -- Can a quasi-mystical system rooted in ancient philosophies bring enlightenment, efficiency and a better bottom line to organizations? For a growing number of companies across the world, the answer seems to be yes. From small businesses in Europe to U.S. government departments, a popularized personality typing system, known as the enneagram, is being promoted, with claims that it improves teamwork, communication and leadership. ""The enneagram"" refers to an ancient symbol -- a circle inscribed with nine points -- with each point indicating a different personality type, driven by a set of fears, motivations and behaviors. Key to the system is that when you understand these, you can change and direct your behavior in order to reach your full potential -- and bring it out in others. It might sound a little hokey to some, but a yearlong study conducted in 2004 by Saville & Holdsworth reported that the enneagram is on par with the Myers-Briggs system, the Big Five and other well-known, accepted psychological systems. ""It is a sort of GPS of wisdom,"" says Pernille Lauritsen, founder of Mindjuice, a leadership training company in Denmark that has used the enneagram for the past 7 years. ""It is a shortcut to understanding what drives people, and to discover strengths and blind spots around yourself and others."" Read more: Struggle fuels career growth . Do you know someone who alphabetizes their spice cabinet? They may be a type 1, organized and ethical, with a strong sense of right and wrong. Often they are teachers, idealists, and advocates for change. The corporate boardroom is likely to be frequented by a number of type 8 personalities. Self-confident, protective and even heroic, under stress they can turn into ego-centric bullies who are secretive and fearful. ""The enneagram allows you to grasp the reality other people are living in, to see where they are coming from, their filters, their points of view -- and then speak directly to that,"" says Helen Palmer, one of the worlds key authors and experts on the enneagram, and co-founder of the Enneagram Worldwide. The enneagram symbol has roots in antiquity and can be traced back to ancient Greece. But it was not until the 1960s when Bolivian philosopher Oscar Ichazo used it to explain the human psyche that it started to enter the mainstream. It was brought to the U.S. and popularized by a student of his, American-taught psychologist Claudio Naranjo, in 1971. Palmer, who was among Naranjo's first students, says the enneagram has since been given a major push by modern neuroscience. ""It proves we can retrain and improve our brains,"" she says. Read more: What jazz musicians have in common with the best leaders . Today, the system is used in therapy and education, and can have a strong spiritual dimension -- but one of the first and major fields of use is business, where it has been adapted as a way of bringing insight into oneself and others. It is typically done with a half-day to two-day course in which participants learn about the nine personality types, pinpoint their own and find out what makes them tick -- and ticked off. That knowledge, says Ramazan Turan, partner in Danish auditing firm Athos, is invaluable. During one particular conflict with a collaborator, he says he recognized that an underlying issue was not being addressed from the other's viewpoint. ""Instead of arguing my case as I normally might have, I asked him what his real concern was,"" he says. ""That simple shift created a completely different conversation that allowed us to address the real conflict and move on."" Read more: How CIA tricks help the best bosses . A 2011 study by Enneagram in Business covering 72 companies, including Best Buy, Daimler-Mitsubishi, Toyota and Avon, found that using the enneagram led to better communication and collaboration, rising sales and increase in employee engagement. ""It is a language for figuring out what gets in the way of change and progress, "" says Todd Pierce, former CIO of biotechnology company Genentech, who says it helped his management team resolve core issues in a matter of hours. But the system is not without its hitches, and its mystical background does raise some eyebrows. ""I don't know that people are ready for this,"" says Gus Kious, President of Summa Physicians in the U.S., who has taught the system at hospitals and with senior management. ""The enneagram requires a degree of investment of time and self, and I get the sense that people are impatient."" Pierce however is an advocate of the system: ""You just have to try it. We live in a world that is becoming hyper-connected. We need to make sure we deal with the human software.""","The enneagram system sorts individuals into nine personality types .

"(CNN) -- In the Information Age, it's easier than ever to steal and publish data. Corporations and governments have to adjust to their secrets being exposed, regularly. When massive amounts of government documents are leaked, journalists sift through them to determine which pieces of information are newsworthy, and confer with government agencies over what needs to be redacted. Managing this reality is going to require that governments actively engage with members of the press who receive leaked secrets, helping them secure those secrets -- even while being unable to prevent them from publishing. It might seem abhorrent to help those who are seeking to bring your secrets to light, but it's the best way to ensure that the things that truly need to be secret remain secret, even as everything else becomes public. The WikiLeaks cables serve as an excellent example of how a government should not deal with massive leaks of classified information. WikiLeaks has said it asked U.S. authorities for help in determining what should be redacted before publication of documents, although some government officials have challenged that statement. WikiLeaks' media partners did redact many documents, but eventually all 250,000 unredacted cables were released to the world as a result of a mistake. The damage was nowhere near as serious as government officials initially claimed, but it had been avoidable. Fast-forward to today, and we have an even bigger trove of classified documents. What Edward Snowden took -- ""exfiltrated"" is the National Security Agency term -- dwarfs the State Department cables, and contains considerably more important secrets. But again, the U.S. government is doing nothing to prevent a massive data dump. The government engages with the press on individual stories. The Guardian, The Washington Post, and The New York Times are all redacting the original Snowden documents based on discussions with the government. This isn't new. The U.S. press regularly consults with the government before publishing something that might be damaging. In 2006, The New York Times consulted with both the NSA and the Bush administration before publishing Mark Klein's whistle-blowing about the NSA's eavesdropping on AT&T trunk circuits. In all these cases, the goal is to minimize actual harm to U.S. security while ensuring the press can still report stories in the public interest, even if the government doesn't want it to. In today's world of reduced secrecy, whistle-blowing as civil disobedience, and massive document exfiltrations, negotiations over individual stories aren't enough. The government needs to develop a protocol to actively help news organizations expose their secrets safely and responsibly. Here's what should have happened as soon as Snowden's whistle-blowing became public. The government should have told the reporters and publications with the classified documents something like this: ""OK, you have them. We know that we can't undo the leak. But please let us help. Let us help you secure the documents as you write your stories, and securely dispose of the documents when you're done."" The people who have access to the Snowden documents say they don't want them to be made public in their raw form or to get in the hands of rival governments. But accidents happen, and reporters are not trained in military secrecy practices. Copies of some of the Snowden documents are being circulated to journalists and others. With each copy, each person, each day, there's a greater chance that, once again, someone will make a mistake and some -- or all -- of the raw documents will appear on the Internet. A formal system of working with whistle-blowers could prevent that. I'm sure the suggestion sounds odious to a government that is actively engaging in a war on whistle-blowers, and that views Snowden as a criminal and the reporters writing these stories as ""helping the terrorists."" But it makes sense. Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain compares this to plea bargaining. The police regularly negotiate lenient sentences or probation for confessed criminals in order to convict more important criminals. They make deals with all sorts of unsavory people, giving them benefits they don't deserve, because the result is a greater good. In the Snowden case, an agreement would safeguard the most important of NSA's secrets from other nations' intelligence agencies. It would help ensure that the truly secret information not be exposed. It would protect U.S. interests. Why would reporters agree to this? Two reasons. One, they actually do want these documents secured while they look for stories to publish. And two, it would be a public demonstration of that desire. Why wouldn't the government just collect all the documents under the pretense of securing them and then delete them? For the same reason they don't renege on plea bargains: No one would trust them next time. And, of course, because smart reporters will probably keep encrypted backups under their own control. We're nowhere near the point where this system could be put into practice, but it's worth thinking about how it could work. The government would need to establish a semi-independent group, called, say, a Leak Management unit, which could act as an intermediary. Since it would be isolated from the agencies that were the source of the leak, its officials would be less vested and -- this is important -- less angry over the leak. Over time, it would build a reputation, develop protocols that reporters could rely on. Leaks will be more common in the future, but they'll still be rare. Expecting each agency to develop expertise in this process is unrealistic. If there were sufficient trust between the press and the government, this could work. And everyone would benefit.

"(CNN) -- It's best not to monkey around with Donald Trump -- or maybe that's a bad choice of words. The billionaire real estate mogul is suing millionaire comedian Bill Maher for $5 million. Why? Because Maher said -- in jest, as comedians are wont to do -- that he would donate $5 million to a charity if Trump could prove he wasn't the ""the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan."" ""I'm not saying it's true,"" Maher told Jay Leno on ""The Tonight Show"" last month. ""I hope it's not true, but unless he comes up with proof ... I'm willing to offer $5 million to Donald Trump that he can donate to a charity of his choice -- Hair Club for Men; The Institute for Incorrigible Douche-bag-ery. Whatever charity."" Opinion: Hijacking the media -- Trump shows how easy it is . Maher picked the figure after Trump, long a skeptic of President Barack Obama's citizenship, offered to give $5 million to the charity of Obama's choice if the president publicly released his college transcripts in addition to his passport records ahead of last year's elections. The White House never directly responded to the challenge. Trump says he provided Maher with a New York birth certificate that proved he didn't descend from an ape -- but Maher hasn't paid up. Trump filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles on Monday. Included in the court documents are a January 8 letter to Maher, accepting the $5 million charity challenge the day after his appearance on Leno, and a copy of Trump's birth certificate, which lists Fred Trump as his father -- not an orangutan. It's a free-swinging smackdown by two men used to speaking their minds and not backing down. Maher, never afraid to ape the object of his pithy humor, was unrelenting on ""The Tonight Show"" in pushing the simian connection. ""The color of his hair (pauses for laughs) and the color of an orange orangutan is the only two things in nature of the same color,"" Maher said to another round of nervous chuckles from the audience. The comedian's reaction to the lawsuit? ""What?? Really? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha,"" he tweeted. Perhaps, he is waiting for Trump to release his long-form birth certificate.","Bill Maher suggests Donald Trump's mom mated with an orangutan .

"(CNN) -- ""My brothers."" That is how President Obama should begin one of the most significant speeches of his presidency: the commencement address at Morehouse College this Sunday. Addressing the historically black all male institution gives Obama an opportunity to rectify his strategic neglect of African-Americans. In this high-profile talk to his own demographic, the president has some explaining to do. Obama's identity as a black man is usually communicated subliminally, with the swag in his walk, the basketball court on the East Lawn, the sexy glances at the first lady, his overall cool. Now, however, comes the time to be explicit: to speak out loud his affiliation, his fraternal pride and concern. That's the good work that calling us ""brothers"" would do. In appearances before African-American audiences, the president sometimes sounds like he's saying the wrong thing. He told the Congressional Black Caucus to ""stop grumbling, stop complaining, stop crying."" In a Father's Day talk at a black church in Chicago, he criticized ""too many fathers"" for ""acting like boys not men."" African-American men certainly could use an intervention from the most successful African-American man in history. They are on the bottom of many indicators of achievement. They suffer the highest level of incarceration, and the largest homicide rates, of any Americans. In urban areas, fewer than half graduate from high school. Their unemployment is among the highest in the country. ""I'm sorry I haven't done more."" The president has not spoken out forcefully against racial profiling and mass incarceration. He has not memorialized the mainly African-American victims of gun violence in Chicago the way he has memorialized the mainly white victims of gun violence in Newtown and Columbine. Asked why he hadn't done more to remedy the catastrophic rate of African-American unemployment, Obama said, ""I can't pass laws that say I'm just helping black folks. I'm president of the entire United States."" ""Thank you for your support."" Nobody understands, like this audience will, the contortions a successful African-American man has to make to fit in but stand out, to be strong but not intimidate or frighten, to be black enough but not too black. But in some ways the African-American community has been too understanding. Emanuel Cleaver, while chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said ""the president knows we are going to act in deference to him in a way we wouldn't to someone white."" Politically it was not the smartest thing to say (the LGBT community didn't turn Obama into the most gay friendly president in U.S. history by going easy on him) but any black man could understand the sentiment. That's why the African-American turnout for the president's re-election was higher than the white turnout. Now blacks who supported the president are doing exactly what other groups responsible for his victory are doing: waiting for him to return the favor. ""We've all got to do better."" The president isn't the only black man who needs to step up support of his brothers. My friend runs a mentoring organization for black boys in Prince George's County, Maryland, the nation's most affluent black community. There is a long waiting list of boys, mostly without dads in the home, and only about 10 active African-American male mentors. President Obama provides, for Morehouse men and everyone else, a 21st century model of African-American masculinity. His oft stated support for women's rights is a crucial component. The casual misogyny of some black popular culture, especially hip-hop music and videos, is a disgrace. It's OK for the president to note that not every aspect of black male culture is praiseworthy. ""That includes me."" The government's primary intervention for black men is to lock them up. President Obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison. One example would be to speak in favor of decriminalizing marijuana, as have other politicians like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Black men are selectively arrested for marijuana crimes, and these arrests have a stigmatizing effect on future employment and earnings that redounds to the detriment of African-American families. Barack Obama was once a young black man who smoked pot, and it would be surprising if he actually believes that it's fair for other young black men to be selectively prosecuted for that. ""I am the most powerful man in the world, and I've got your back."" Those are words profound enough to make a black man cry. I believe them to be true, but hearing them proclaimed out loud would be incredibly meaningful. African-American men feel a special kinship with this president. How inspiring it would be for the president to acknowledge this connection, in his words and in his actions. What a difference it might make for the millions of black boys who now are headed to destinies very different from graduating from Morehouse College or becoming president of the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Butler.","Paul Butler: At Morehouse commencement speech, Obama must show grads he's a brother .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq said Friday that it will file a lawsuit against five Blackwater security guards cleared of manslaughter charges in the 2007 killing of 17 Iraqi civilians, an act a government official called murder. The Iraqi government also will ask the U.S. Justice Department to appeal a federal judge's ""unfair and unacceptable"" dismissal of the charges Thursday, spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said. An Iraqi man wounded in the 2007 incident also voiced his anger Friday, saying U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina's dismissal of the charges showed ""disregard for Iraqi blood."" Urbina found Thursday that prosecutors wrongly used the guards' own statements against them. ""We were expecting that American justice system is fair and independent,"" said Hassan Jaber Salman, a lawyer. ""It's clear that the justice system in America is unjust and unfair."" Al-Dabbagh said ""investigations carried out by specialized Iraqi authorities unequivocally found that the Blackwater guards committed murder and broke use-of-force rules when there was no threat requiring the use of force."" The September 16, 2007, bloodbath in Baghdad's Nusour Square, which also left two dozen wounded, led Iraq's government to place limits on security contractors hired by Blackwater and other contractors. Blackwater has since changed its name to Xe. The Blackwater employees were guarding a State Department convoy in western Baghdad when the shooting began. The company said its contractors came under attack, but Iraqi authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate. Urbina found that the government's case was built largely on ""statements compelled under a threat of job loss"" during a State Department investigation of the shootings, violating the Fifth Amendment rights of the five men charged. ""In their zeal to bring charges against the defendant in this case, the prosecutors and investigators aggressively sought out statements the defendants had been compelled to make to government investigators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting and in the subsequent investigation,"" Urbina wrote in a 90-page decision. Federal prosecutors ""repeatedly disregarded the warnings of experienced, senior prosecutors assigned to the case,"" the judge said. In the ruling, which followed three weeks of hearings, Urbina said the explanations prosecutors and federal agents offered for using the guards' statements were ""all too often contradictory, unbelievable and lacking in credibility."" ""In short, the government has utterly failed to prove that it made no impermissible use of the defendants' statements or that such use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,"" he wrote. There was no immediate response to the decision from the Justice Department, which can appeal the ruling or seek new indictments against the men. The men were guarding a State Department convoy moving through western Baghdad when the shooting began. The company said its contractors came under attack, but Iraqi authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate. Each of the now-former guards -- Paul Slough, Evan Liberty, Dustin Heard, Donald Ball and Nicholas Slatten -- faced 14 counts of manslaughter, 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime. Prosecutors requested that charges against Slatten be dropped in November, but Thursday's ruling dismissed the counts against all five. ""We're obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are very happy that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them,"" said Slough's lawyer, Mark Hulkower. A sixth guard involved in the shootings, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","NEW: Iraq to ask Justice Department to appeal decision dismissing charges .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- As Jamal al-Durrah washes his son Mohammad's tombstone in a Gaza graveyard, he fears that the boy's spirit rests uneasy. The image of the father shielding his 12-year-old son in a hail of bullets, under the glare of a camera, became the symbol of the second Palestinian uprising, or Intifada. Thirteen years later, the controversy behind those pictures is still alive. An Israeli government committee concluded in a report presented Sunday that the story, which was broadcast by France 2 in 2000, cannot be substantiated by the pictures. Children of the conflict: Innocence interrupted by war . The news report aired by France 2 stated: ""Here Jamal and his son Mohammad are the target of fire coming from the Israeli position. ... But, a new round of fire, Mohammad is dead and his father badly hurt."" However, the Israeli government committee report states: ""There is no evidence that the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) was in any way responsible for causing any of the alleged injuries to Jamal or the boy."" It's a statement that pains a still-grieving father. But Jamal al-Durrah is prepared to have his son's remains exhumed to demonstrate that he was killed by Israeli bullets, as reported in 2000. ""I would like to show the world the truth, and I am sitting in front of my son's grave and ready to accept an international independent investigation commission including Arabs,"" he said. ""If Israel agrees, I am ready to open the grave."" The head of the Israeli government review committee, Yossi Kuperwasser, said he does not know what happened to Mohammad al-Durrah. Showing the raw material provided by France 2 to CNN, he said, ""See, he was supposed to be dead. He was declared dead a moment ago, understand, he was declared dead when he was lying (there.) That's where he cut it. He said the boy is dead. But a second later, he (Mohammad al-Durrah) raises his hand."" Analysis: Conflict shifts balance of power in the Middle East . Israel places the implications of the Mohammad al-Durrah story in a much wider context. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""It is important to focus on this incident, which has slandered Israel's reputation. This is a manifestation of the ongoing, mendacious campaign to delegitimize Israel. ""There is only one way to counter lies, and that is through the truth. Only the truth can prevail over lies."" The search for that truth has been conducted in courthouses, human rights reports and media investigations. Cameraman Talal Abu Rahma, who filmed the event for France 2, and also works for CNN, has been at the center of trying to understand what happened on that fateful day. Thirteen years later, he points to the camera that recorded the event as his most solid source, saying: ""My witness is (my) camera. ... I am sorry this camera does not talk, but really this camera recorded that footage."" Mohammad al-Durrah's story has become an important symbol in the Palestinian struggle for statehood. The image of his final moments is shown on stamps in Egypt, Tunisia, Iraq, Iran and Morocco. Israel says that the false narrative of al-Durrah's death has been used to justify terrorist attacks against Israel and worldwide anti-Semitism. It is perhaps the ongoing struggle between Israelis and Palestinians over the righteousness of their narrative that will not let this image be forgotten.","An Israeli government committee disputes a France 2 report of a Gaza boy's death .

"(CNN) -- People don't generally care what politicians read. But Rep. Paul Ryan is different. His fascination with the Russian-born novelist Ayn Rand could spell trouble for the GOP's new vice-presidential candidate. It could put him at odds with the Christian right and the Roman Catholic Church. It all depends how much you believe that he is in the thrall of Ayn Rand. Rand (1905-1982) is controversial because of the extremism of her views. In researching my recent book, I found that Rand's influence on the Republican Party, which dates back as far as her endorsement of Wendell Willkie in 1940, has been sharply growing, largely due to her vise-like hold on the imagination of the tea party and people like Ryan. Rand was the author of two best-selling novels, ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged."" These books, along with her other novels and essays, set forth an ideology which she called objectivism. Her books have sold in the millions and appeal to people ranging from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to the rock band Rush. (Rush's lyricist and drummer, Neil Peart, only this year renounced his interest in Rand, three decades after writing the songs her work inspired.) College students notoriously go through an ""Ayn Rand phase"" because her books emphasize self-reliance and breaking away from one's parents. For most people, it's a kind of literary infatuation. But for a few, Rand becomes a lifelong passion. Bennett: Why Paul Ryan? What made her books controversial is not violence or sex, though both ""Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas"" have their share of bodice-ripping, but an extremist vision of America that celebrated greed and selfishness, rejected altruism as ""evil"" and opposed the fundamental tenets of Judeo-Christian morality. (She was also a militant atheist who favored abortion.) Paul Ryan says that he read her books as a youth but was not influenced by her. In April, he gave an interview to National Review in which he repudiated Rand entirely. In the interview, he called reports of his adherence to Rand's views an ""urban legend"" and said that he was more deeply influenced by his Roman Catholic faith and by Thomas Aquinas. But that's not the way he was talking in 2005, when he gave a speech to the Atlas Society, a group dedicated to promoting Rand's beliefs. In that speech, Ryan said, ""I grew up reading Ayn Rand and it taught me quite a bit about who I am and what my value systems are and what my beliefs are. It's inspired me so much that it's required reading in my office for all my interns and my staff."" He went on to say that ""the reason I got involved in public service, by and large, if I had to credit one thinker, one person, it would be Ayn Rand. And the fight we are in here, make no mistake about it, is a fight of individualism versus collectivism."" Avlon: Paul Ryan will shift the campaign dynamic . Ryan very succinctly summed up the Randian worldview in those remarks. Rand painted the world in stark terms, as a struggle between the individual and the collective. In ""The Fountainhead,"" which was published in 1943, her hero was an architect, Howard Roark, who pursued his vision despite opposition from the media and the architectural establishment. He dislikes money and status and is solely focused on seeing his vision expressed through his work. He even allows another architect to take the credit for a public housing project that he designed. But when the project is not built according to his wishes, he blows it up. The book was widely denounced as amoral when it came out, but it had enough wide appeal that it was adapted into a 1949 movie with Gary Cooper as Roark and Patricia Neal as his love interest. But the stir that it caused when it came out was nothing like the explosion of fury that greeted ""Atlas Shrugged"" when it was published in 1957. That book advanced her belief that laissez-faire capitalism, unsullied by government interference or regulation, was the only moral social system. Unlike the sometimes impoverished architect in ""Fountainhead,"" the heroes of ""Atlas Shrugged"" were millionaires and industrialists, depicted as a degraded class who had to strike to throw off the yoke of oppression. The heroes of that book included a noble railroad heiress, Dagny Taggart, and a struggling steel tycoon, Hank Rearden, but they are overshadowed by a character who emerges toward the end, John Galt, an inventor who leads the downtrodden 1% on a strike. Castellanos: Paul Ryan and Gen X GOP . Rand further expounded on her beliefs in essays that were published in her newsletters, and in anthologies with titles like ""The Virtue of Selfishness"" and ""Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal."" The latter, first published in 1966, contained three essays by Alan Greenspan, one of which argued forcefully against all forms of regulation, even building codes. These essays were published by Rand and reflected her thinking. His strident essays for that book, which he has never repudiated or withdrawn from publication, were echoed by his actions in the 1990s as a principal supporter of financial deregulation in his capacity as chairman of the Federal Reserve. In a famous appearance before a congressional committee in 2008, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, asked Greenspan, ""Do you feel that your ideology pushed you to make decisions that you wish you had not made?"" Greenspan conceded that there was a ""flaw"" in his belief system, which was widely cited as a repudiation of Rand, who was his friend for 30 years. In April 2010, appearing before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, he denied that he had ever repudiated his ideology. ""The flaw in the system that I acknowledged was an inability to fully understand the state and extent of potential risks that were as yet untested,"" he said. Granderson: Why America doesn't like Mitt Romney . Greenspan didn't mention Rand by name, but in an interview that same month he was asked if the financial crisis was ""an indictment of Ayn Rand and the view that laissez-faire capitalism can be expected to function properly, that markets can be trusted to police themselves?"" His response: ""Not at all."" Ryan's effort to put daylight between himself and Rand also reeks of history-rewriting. Certainly the speech he gave before the Atlas Society in 2005, in which he toed the Randian line, was no ""urban legend."" Ryan is no atheist, but atheism was at the core of her philosophy, because the teachings of the Bible simply do not jibe with her belief that selfishness is moral, greed is good and altruism is evil. It's not surprising that Ryan's budget plan, which cuts programs for the poor and middle class while imposing no new taxes on the rich, has been criticized by some in the Roman Catholic Church. Paul Ryan can either be an objectivist or a Christian. He can't have it both ways. He faces a serious problem among Christians, moderate Republicans and others who dislike Rand's views if his expressions of support for Rand are believed, rather than his denials.

"Washington (CNN) -- New details emerged of what the White House knew about the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups, with spokesman Jay Carney disclosing Chief of Staff Denis McDonough was among the top officials made aware of the matter late last month. In a new timeline provided by Carney to reporters on Monday, General Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler learned on April 24 of a pending Treasury inspector general's report on how IRS staff used criteria targeting conservative groups in assessing eligibility for tax-exempt status. According to Carney, Ruemmler told McDonough as well as other Treasury officials about the pending report. It was the first time the White House acknowledged that McDonough was aware of the report before it became public in early May. IRS: By the numbers . In addition, Carney made clear that the information Ruemmler received on April 24 included details of improper acts by IRS officials. At the same time, Carney emphasized that the information was preliminary and could have changed before the inspector general released his final report on May 14. Carney insisted no one -- including Ruemmler and McDonough -- told President Barack Obama anything about the inspector general's pending report before media reports about it began appearing on May 10. ""We knew the subject of the investigation and we knew the nature of some of the potential findings, but we did not have a copy of the draft report,"" Carney said. ""We did not know the details, the scope, or the motivation surrounding the misconduct and we did not know who was responsible. Most importantly, the report was not final and still very much subject to change."" Opinion: What happened to Obama's promise? However, the new information on Monday continued a perception of a White House on the defensive over the issue, one of at least three controversies dogging Obama as his second term reaches the four-month mark. The Senate Finance Committee will hold the second congressional hearing on the matter Tuesday, after the House Ways and Means Committee grilled the outgoing acting commissioner of the IRS last Friday. On Monday, the Senate panel's Democratic chairman and ranking Republican sent a letter to the IRS official, Steven Miller, seeking an exhaustive list of information about the case. Another hearing is set for Wednesday by a third panel -- the House Oversight Committee. Some Republicans are calling for a special investigation into the IRS matter, in which tax officers assessing applications for tax-exempt status used key words such as ""tea party"" in determining levels of scrutiny. CNN Poll: Likability helps Obama survive brutal week . Separately on Monday, a Northern California tea party group filed the first lawsuit against the U.S. government stemming from the IRS targeting. ""The IRS and its agents singled out groups like NorCal Tea Party Patriots for intensive and intrusive scrutiny, probing their members' associates, speech, activities and beliefs,"" according to the suit filed in Cincinnati. ""NorCal and its members suffered years of delay and expense while awaiting the exemption and spending valuable time and money answering the IRS' questions. The result was a muffling and muzzling of free expression"" the lawsuit claimed. The group alleged violations under the Privacy Act as well as violations of its constitutional rights guaranteeing free expression and equal protection under the law. Opinion: We're pointing a gun at our democracy . Carney offered the new timeline in response to the first question at his daily media briefing, when a reporter noted ""confusion"" over what Ruemmler was told about the inspector general report in late April. He noted the report found no outside intervention in the IRS targeting of what he called ""inappropriate scrutinizing of conservative groups"" seeking tax-exempt status, and that no one in the White House intervened in the inspector general's review or ""did anything that could be see as intervening."" In addition, Carney said, the misconduct had stopped in May 2012, almost a year before Ruemmler or anyone else at the White House were told of it by anyone at Treasury. At the same time, Carney disclosed that White House and Treasury officials discussed the pending inspector general's report in the weeks before its formal release, even though he said no one told Obama about it. The White House first was notified of the upcoming report, known as an audit, on April 16, he said, calling that a routine notification also provided to Congress. Ruemmler was told about it eight days later and she informed McDonough and others about it shortly thereafter, Carney said. ""Ruemmler was informed that the inspector general for tax administration was completing a report about line IRS employees improperly scrutinizing what are known 501(c)(4) organizations by using words such as 'tea party' and 'patriot',"" he said. In particular, Carney said that ""at no time did anyone on the White House staff intervene with the IRS inspector general audit."" ""There were communications between the White House Counsel's office and White House Chief of Staff's office with Treasury Office of General Counsel and Treasury's Chief of Staff office to understand the anticipated timing of the release of the report and potential findings by the"" inspector general, he said, but added that Ruemmler acted properly in not informing the president. IRS official denies intentional political targeting, lying to Congress . ""The cardinal rule, as I said, is you do not intervene in an independent investigation and you do not do anything that would be, that would give such an appearance particularly when the final conclusions, as was the case here, have not been reached,"" Carney said. ""That is the doctrine we followed and the bottom line is, and this isn't just the most important fact, it is what we have said from the beginning - neither the White House nor Treasury intervened in the inspector general's audit."" Last week, Miller blamed a huge increase in workload, rather than deliberate targeting, for ""foolish mistakes"" in the political discrimination cited by the inspector general's report. He told the House Ways and Means Committee that the IRS division handling requests for tax exempt status was overwhelmed by a surge that followed the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision. ""I think that what happened here was that foolish mistakes were made by people who were trying to be more efficient in their workload selection,"" Miller said, calling the practices described in the inspector general's report as ""intolerable"" and a ""mistake,"" but ""not an act of partisanship."" He apologized for what he later called ""horrible customer service,"" but he also stubbornly rejected any accusation that it amounted to politicizing the work of the IRS. However, Republicans noted the increased requests for tax exempt status didn't kick in until 2011, months after the targeting began, according to the inspector general's report. Rep. Dave Camp, chairman of the Republican-led panel, and other GOP members sought to depict the controversy as indicative of government gone wild, with the IRS abusing conservative groups and other political foes of the administration. Democrats on the committee also expressed outrage at the targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, but they pointed out that the top IRS official at the time was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, not Obama. Opinion: IRS scandal is about donors, not tax . They also noted that the inspector general's report stated there was no evidence of any political motivation for what happened, or influence from outside the IRS. The Treasury Department oversees the quasi-independent IRS. Some Republicans are trying to find a link between the Obama administration and the IRS targeting. According to the inspector general's report, the IRS developed and followed a faulty policy to determine whether the applicants were engaged in political activities, which would disqualify the groups from receiving tax-exempt status. The controversial move began in early 2010 and continued for more than 18 months, the report said, declaring that ""the IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention."" Among the criteria used by IRS officials to flag applications was a ""Be On the Look Out"" list, which was discontinued in 2012, the report said. Conservative groups complain their requests were delayed for months or even years through the targeting that sought to prevent ineligible political groups from getting tax exempt status. Miller testified Friday that determining the political nature of groups was one of the hardest tasks of IRS officers tasked with assessing requests for tax exempt status. The investigation by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration was initiated after congressional complaints began to surface in the media in 2012 that the IRS was targeting conservative groups and holding up applications. In a written response included in the report, the IRS commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division said there was no criminal behavior behind the actions of the agents, but rather inefficient management. Obama called the inspector general's findings outrageous and forced Miller's resignation. In addition, the commissioner of the IRS' Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division also announced his retirement Thursday. Joseph Grant will leave in June, according to an internal IRS memo provided to CNN. Miller also is scheduled to exit then. Obama has appointed Danny Werfel, a White House budget office official who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, to succeed Miller through the end of the fiscal year on September 30.

"(CNN) -- Russian lawmakers could move to ban Americans from adopting children from the country -- which is one of the top sources of international adoptions to the United States. A bill to block adoption to the United States passed the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, on its first reading last week and it will be considered again Wednesday for a crucial second reading, according to Russia's RIA Novosti news agency. This could affect hundreds of American families seeking to adopt Russian children. From 1999 to 2011, 45,112 adoptions to the United States came from Russia, second to only China, according to the U.S. State Department statistics. However, the number of adoptions from Russia has waned in recent years after a peak in 2005. United Russia, the majority party in the parliament backs the adoption ban, political leaders told Russian media. This move by Russian politicians is widely seen as retaliation to a recent law U.S. President Barack Obama signed on December 14, called the Magnitsky Act. This imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia. The act is named after a Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. After Magnitsky died in a Moscow detention center in 2009, his name became the basis of Washington's list of Russian officials who were involved in the tax fraud and in the deceased lawyer's detention. Russian leaders have criticized the passage of the Magnitsky Act and wrote new legislation that would impose restrictions that include banning U.S. citizens who've violated Russians' rights, freezing their assets and ending adoptions to the United States. ""It is prohibited to transfer children who are citizens of the Russian Federation, for adoption to the citizens of the United States, and to conduct in the Russian Federation activities of organizations for the purpose of selection and placement of children who are citizens of the Russian Federation, for adoption to the citizens of the United States of America wishing to adopt these children,"" the bill states. If the bill passes, it would nullify a pre-existing agreement between the United States and Russia, in which the countries agreed to additional safeguards to protect children and parties involved in intercountry adoptions. Backers of the bill say American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing 19 deaths of Russian children by their adoptive parents since the 1990s, according to local media. In 2010, an American woman sent her adopted son back to Russia, claiming that the then-7-year-old boy had violent episodes that made the family fear for its safety.

"London (CNN) -- It's a simple love story: Girl meets guy, it's hate at first sight, and then they fall in love. ""Pride and Prejudice,"" the original rom-com, turns 200 today, with fans around the world celebrating the story that launched a whole industry. The tale of feisty heroine Elizabeth Bennet and her relationship with the haughty, brooding Darcy is the stuff of spinoffs aplenty: Even if you've never read the original, chances are you've seen one of its many remakes, from Bridget Jones to Bollywood, zombie thrillers to murder mysteries. But Jane Austen's best-known and most-loved novel, first published on January 28, 1813, and viewed by the author as her ""own darling child"" wasn't an immediate hit. ""It was very well received, and it made money, but it wasn't a massive bestseller in her day,"" says Louise West, curator of the Jane Austen House Museum at Chawton, in Hampshire. Instead it became a slow-burn success, turning its creator -- after her early death in 1817 -- into a literary star. In his recent book ""What Matters in Jane Austen?"" expert John Mullan claims that only Shakespeare and Dickens ""can rival her continuing, international appeal."" Cambridge University English professor Janet Todd puts Austen's enduring appeal down to ""the mixture of simplicity and complexity -- her work looks so simple, so ordinary, and yet underneath, the more you look, the more you see, and the more complicated it becomes. ""Austen is one of the very few real crossover writers, who are popular with the public and also feted by critics and academia -- it is very rare."" ""It's not just any old love story,"" says West. ""It is also brilliantly written. Austen was the first truly modern novelist, and 'Pride and Prejudice' is full of irony, craft, careful plotting -- you read it for the story, but you get all these other layers of richness too."" But she says the secret of the story's success is down to its protagonists, Elizabeth and Darcy, ""two terribly attractive characters who spark off each other in a very dynamic and sexy way,"" and to its heroine, in particular. ""'Pride and Prejudice' is the book that brings more people here than any other,"" says West. ""They come looking for Elizabeth Bennet -- she is the character women aspire to be, she got the fairy story, and they want it to be real."" The book's bicentenary is being marked throughout the year with a series of events, starting with an international ""Pride and Prejudice Readathon"" at the Jane Austen Centre in Bath on Monday, and including exhibitions and an outdoor theater production in London. A conference celebrating the anniversary will also be held at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge University, featuring everything from scholarly lectures to a Regency Ball -- and talks by figures including veteran mystery writer P.D. James, who turned ""Pride and Prejudice"" into a detective story in her ""sequel,"" ""Death Comes to Pemberley."" In Jane Austen's footsteps: Discover novelist's England . Over the course of two centuries, what began as a simple love story, sold to a publisher for Â£110 at the time, is now a global industry worth billions of dollars: Everything from Hollywood movies to bestselling books, including 2009 parody ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"" and even themed weddings. ""It is a multi-billion pound business, because nobody has to pay any royalties to the author,"" explains solicitor Mark Stephens. ""They can just go back to the original text and remake programs, and as a result they're much cheaper to make."" A string of hugely popular adaptations, from TV miniseries to big budget Hollywood versions has helped ensure the novel remains popular with generation after generation. West said the most notable boost came from the BBC's 1995 version, starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth, and -- famously -- Colin Firth as Darcy, complete with wet shirt. ""That had a major impact for us,"" she says. ""At the time we had about 25,000 visitors a year, and that doubled almost overnight -- we had 58,000 visitors that year. ""Everyone fell in love with Colin Firth. I don't want to go on about him -- though I could, of course,"" she jokes. ""He wasn't the only thing people loved about that version, but I'd be lying if I said he hadn't had a major impact."" David Lassman, of the Jane Austen Centre in Bath, agrees. ""The 1995 production really ignited the whole Jane Austen 'industry'."" And it's not just about the cash: Some fans say ""Pride and Prejudice"" has changed their life. Austen herself wondered if the novel was ""too light and bright and sparkling,"" but for many it is just this uplifting tone which has ""taught them to hope."" ""Our visitors' book is full of comments from people who've come from around the world, telling us what 'Pride and Prejudice' means to them,"" says West. ""They range from the usual 'It's my favourite book,' and 'I love Darcy,' to 'This book has saved me at times of great trial,' she says, adding: ""Austen was even prescribed to soldiers in World War I, to help them get over shell shock."" For Lassman, the timelessness of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is key: ""Things change, the world is modernized, but deep down we still want the same things: Love, and happiness."" Gurinder Chadha, director of 2005 Bollywood remake ""Bride & Prejudice"" says the story is universal -- whatever the setting. ""Jane Austen said that every woman wants to find their Darcy,"" says Chadha. ""They don't want to compromise to to be accepted by that Darcy, they want to be their own woman. It's a romantic desire that we all have. It's the ultimate love story."" And that, it would seem, is... a truth universally acknowledged.

"(CNN) -- Iraqi President Jalal Talabani will travel to Germany for medical treatment, Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman said Wednesday. Talabani is in stable condition, his office said. Talabani was rushed to a Baghdad hospital Monday night in deteriorating health because of hardening of his arteries, his office told the media. But Othman, who is close to Talabani, said earlier this week that the 79-year-old leader had suffered a stroke. ""His health condition is not very good,"" he said. Read more: Read more: Iraq's president in stable condition, office says . The president's office on Tuesday released a statement saying that Talabani was exhausted. ""Recently, His Excellency President Jalal Talabani spent exhaustive efforts in order to accomplish harmony and stability in the country. Due to fatigue and exhaustion, His Excellency had a health emergency,"" the office said. Talabani was elected president of Iraq in 2005, in the nation's first free elections in more than 50 years. This is not the first time he has dealt with serious medical issues. At times, the exact nature of his ailments has been shrouded in secrecy. In February 2007, he fell ill and was flown to Jordan for treatment, and there were conflicting reports about what prompted his hospitalization. A hospital source told CNN at the time that doctors performed a catheterization procedure on his heart, but his family and aides denied that. Talabani's doctor and a spokesman for the president's office said then that he was suffering from exhaustion and lung inflammation, and underwent tests they described as precautionary. He did not return to Iraq until March of that year. Two months later, Talabani left for medical tests and to lose weight, his office said. He did not return until June. In January 2012, he had spinal surgery in Germany. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","Jalal Talabani was hospitalized earlier this week in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Arizona's Maricopa county listed the wrong date in the Spanish version of voter registration cards, a development likely to further complicate tense relations between local authorities and Latino residents. The county's elections office says it mailed out nearly 2 million new voter registration cards. Only about 50 of the cards -- handed out over-the-counter at its offices -- had the error, it said. Instead of November 6, the Spanish translation said the election would take place on November 8. ""The program has been updated so it reflects the correct dates in both English and Spanish,"" the county said in a statement. A local rights group said the damage has already been done. ""It's a mistake that should not have happened,"" Petra Falcon, the executive director of Promise Arizona in Action, told CNN affiliate KNXV-TV. ""To know that there's information out there that's wrong, it's going to take a lot of work to make sure that people know the correct date."" Promise Arizona describes itself as ""a nonprofit organization dedicated to expanding civic participation in Arizona, particularly among Latinos and youth."" County officials and local Hispanics have long had an adversarial relationship, particularly over the subject of illegal immigration. Those disputes have landed in court. In one instance, the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona and other attorneys are representing Hispanics in a class-action lawsuit accusing Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio of civil rights and constitutional violations. The bench trial is being held in the U.S. District Court in Phoenix. Plaintiffs in the civil case accuse Arpaio -- who bills himself as ""America's toughest"" -- and his department of racial discrimination against Latinos. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, are waiting for a federal judge's ruling after a trial of their class-action lawsuit. Arpaio denies any discrimination. In a separate matter, the U.S. Justice Department has also accused the sheriff's office of civil rights violations against Latinos. The sheriff has described the lawsuit against him and the county as politically motivated. ""They're using me for the Latino vote, showing that they're doing something, taking on the sheriff over an alleged racial profiling,"" he said in May. Arpaio rejected the Department of Justice's call for monitors to oversee the workings of his department. ""That shows you they want to take over this office,"" he said. ""Under this agreement with the so-called monitor, I'd probably have to clear every press release before I go public, especially having to do with illegal immigration, with the Department of Justice."" His remarks came after the Justice Department filed the civil lawsuit. ""At its core, this is an abuse-of-power case involving a sheriff and sheriff's office that disregarded the Constitution, ignored sound police practices, compromised public safety and did not hesitate to retaliate against perceived critics,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez said in May. The Justice Department had delivered in December a report with findings of civil rights violations and sought to fix them through a negotiated settlement with Maricopa County and its sheriff's office. Those talks broke down in February over the county's refusal to consider any agreement that involved an independent monitor, Perez said. According to the civil complaint, the sheriff's office has displayed a pattern of discrimination against Latinos, which includes racial profiling, unlawful detention and searches, and unlawful targeting of Latinos during raids. Arpaio has denied any discrimination, and one of his attorneys called the Justice Department investigation a ""witch hunt.""

"Moore, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Sun was hard to come by in Moore, Oklahoma, Tuesday. The sky still looked menacing, dark and foggy. Mist turned to rain. Lightning struck. From the air, this suburb outside Oklahoma City looked like flattened cardboard. On the ground, homes were messes of splinters. Cars, thrown like toys, sat in ridiculous places. Hunks of steel hung in trees -- the trees that were left. Most were shaved down to gnarly apocalyptic wishbones. When people were allowed back on their street -- if emergency crews gave them the green light -- that's when the real trauma set in for many. It's bizarre and disorienting when every landmark and sign your eye knows is suddenly gone and there's miles of nothing in its place. ""It's funny when you can't tell your own stuff when you get back and look at it like this,"" Mack James said, standing in the rubble that used to be his house. Moore has no power. Water is out and volunteers are handing out bottles. The twister is gone but the danger is still real. Gas lines are being checked. Crews are out searching for live wires. ""It was horrible,"" recalled one elderly woman, sitting in a chair near piles of debris. ""The thunder and the sound was like a turning of the world. It was so bad but we were in the cellar right out there. You could hear the thing just blowin', hear the pounding. ""I can't even believe I'm still alive."" The realization of the loss of material things is just beginning. Photos are gone. Family heirlooms might not ever be found. How to help . But there is worse. Rescue workers are still trying to find survivors, as reports keep coming in about those missing. Wearing a thick red hoodie, Zack Woodcock looked intensely worried and lost in thought as he told a CNN reporter that a wrestler on his son's wrestling team was missing. ""It's hard,"" he muttered, looking like he hasn't been to sleep. The death toll was 24, according to Oklahoma City Medical Examiner spokeswoman Amy Elliott. Nine of the dead are children, she said. Frantic kids and parents . On Monday evening, kids screamed for their parents and parents hollered their children's names, walking and searching in panic in a parking lot near Briarwood Elementary. ""Caleb! Caleb!"" one woman could be heard screaming, as another woman, her face bloody, walked zombie-like through the crowd, holding a young boy's hand. ""Step over the wire!"" someone shouted. Adults and children zigzagged past each other. One man went to a little boy standing alone, whose face was just then cracking into a full-out cry. The man put his arm around the child and they both looked out into the chaotic parking lot, apparently searching for the boy's parents. One mother who spotted her son sitting with his teacher on a curb gently grabbed the boy's hands and stood him up and then learned her whole body over him, hugging him. She cried and then laughed and cupped his face. ""He was so brave!"" the teacher said. The mother then embraced the teacher. ""Thank you,"" she wept, ""thank you."" Jim Routon, who showed up to help at the school, held his arm up and shouted, ""5th graders!"" But, of course, parents and kids continued to wander, desperate, scared. It was a valiant effort though -- trying to offer order where none could be found. Three hours of emotional torture . Janna Ketchie was trapped at work, unable to get on the road because of downed power lines. She texted, desperate for news about her two boys at a day-care center. It was next to Briarwood Elementary, which Ketchie knew was badly damaged. ""Those three hours where I didn't hear anything, they were the longest three hours of my life,"" she said. ""Knowing I'd never see them again. No mother should ever have to go through that."" But she did see them again, thanks to a teacher who covered her 3-year-old and 6-week-old with a mattress and her body. Grayson Ketchie suffered a head wound and an ear injury. His baby brother? Unscathed. ""It's a miracle, an absolute miracle,"" said Rick Roberts, one of the boys' grandfathers. A day after the 200-mph twister knocked down his building, Grayson was in a playful mood, happily reunited with his family. When asked what happened to the day-care facility, he said, ""Broke!"" No one at the center was killed, officials said. An elementary school mourns . While Briarwood families found their children, it was far worse for parents with kids at Plaza Towers Elementary School. The building was reduced to just a few walls. Monday night a father sat on a stool, tears in his eyes, as a firefighter tried to comfort him. He awaited news of his son, a third-grader. At least seven children were killed at the school, police said. Students who managed to escape said they hugged and clung to walls as the tornado passed through, according to CNN affiliate KFOR. One teacher told KFOR that she lay on top of six students in the bathroom. They survived. Norma Bautista told CNN that when she arrived, she found her child and nieces and nephews and took them away. ""I am speechless as [to] how this happened, why it happened,"" she said. ""How do we explain it to the kids?"" Her son, Julio, said teachers told students to crouch and cover their heads. 1999: They've been through this before . What's left behind . A tornado leaves intact the most absurd things sometimes. A cardboard box of tax returns sat on a pile of wood that was once someone's home. One woman's bathroom was the only room untouched in her house, she said. Though their home was obliterated, Kristina Daniel and her husband Donovan told a London Telegraph reporter that the only thing untouched in their home appeared to be an empty water bottle. ""You just wanna break down and cry,"" Steve Wilkerson told CNN, holding a laundry basket that contained the belongings he could find. ""But you know, that's how it goes,"" Wilkerson said, his voice shaking. ""You gotta be strong and keep going."" He's lived in Oklahoma his whole life. He's seen tornadoes before, but nothing like this one. ""I still can't believe this is happening,"" he said. ""You work 20 years, and then it's gone in 15 minutes."" Not far away, another woman was joyous when she got a text from her son, Cody, who started walking down a major street in Moore and saw his grandmother walking dazed along the road with her Yorkie. ""Grandma is fine,"" her son texted. ""She is at my house. Mom, everything is gone. There is nothing left, anywhere. All of the pictures, all grandma's stuff, all my pictures, my letter jacket, my college degree from OU. There's nothing left."" In another part of Moore, Lando Hite was shirtless, his hair and body caked with mud, as he described what happened at a horse and entertainment farm. ""It was just like the movie 'Twister,'"" he told CNN affiliate KFOR. ""There were horses and stuff flying around everywhere."" The tornado slammed into the Orr Family Farm, which had about 80 horses. It damaged several barns; Hite was worried that most of the animals had been killed. ""I tried to let some of the horses out of their stalls so that they would have a chance,"" said Hite. The building he took shelter in moved about 100 feet, he said, when the twister hit. A woman told CNN that she saw a horse after the twister. The animal was bleeding, but alive. It's personal for National Guard . Tuesday morning, Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb spoke to CNN affiliate KOKI from a Dick's Sporting Goods parking lot. ""I'm not a pessimist and I have a lot of faith and a lot of hope, but just with the enormity and severity of this storm..."" he trailed off. At least 85 patients were at a local trauma center. Of those, roughly 60 are children, Lamb said. But he insisted that Oklahomans stay positive. ""Let's focus on the good news for a moment, the good news is that in the overnight hours, 101 survivors were found,"" he said. ""I talked to a (National) Guardsman early this morning. He told me he found three bodies overnight, but his eyes got brighter as he said he found an elderly couple holding onto one another in their shelter scared to death. But they're alive and well today. ""So thank you to the men and women who are providing the search and rescue right now."" CNN spoke with several guard members overnight. They live in and around Moore when they aren't deployed. Like so many others, some of them were searching for their own family members, too.

"(CNN) -- A Western security contractor was brutally assaulted in southern Iraq this week by a Shiite mob after he reportedly insulted their sect of Islam. A 10-minute video circulating on social media sites showed an angry mob of men carrying metal rods, a pickax and other sharp objects attacking the car the man was in, smashing the glass and dragging him out. More than a dozen men are seen beating the man, who pleaded for the attackers to stop as blood streamed down his face. The security contractor's condition was unclear on Wednesday. According to local media reports, the man was identified as a British security consultant from the UK-based private security firm G4S contracted by the oil services company Schlumberger at Iraq's Rumeilah oil field, the country's largest. The man reportedly tore down flags with the images of two of Shiite Islam's most revered imams -- Imam Ali and Imam Hussein -- that Iraqi staff had placed on a company car on Monday. The security contractor appeared to be wearing a G4S T-shirt in the video. Neither G4S nor Schlumberger has responded to CNN's requests for comment on the incident. Among the attackers were Iraqi guards from the Canada-based security company Garda World, which has an office in the United States. A spokesman for Garda World confirmed to CNN that some of its employees were involved in the incident. ""Garda World employees were not involved in the initial incident,"" Joe Gavaghan, a company spokesman, told CNN on Wednesday. ""But during subsequent disturbance a small number of local national employees took part."" Gavaghan said Garda World was working with ""the client"" and local authorities to investigate the incident. ""We take this issue seriously and are well aware of cultural sensitivities ... We do not tolerate inappropriate behavior,"" he said. A number of Iraqi men, including Garda World guards, are seen later in the video trying to stop the assault by the mob that at times chanted Shiite slogans. Amid the chaos at the end of the video, a member of the Iraqi security forces appears on the scene as the man was dragged away before the clip ended. The British Foreign Office told CNN on Wednesday they were aware of ""an incident"" and ""are providing consular assistance."" According to a statement by the Basra local government, Gov. Majed al-Nasrawi met with senior local security and oil officials on Tuesday about the incident. In that meeting, according to the statement, the governor stated that religious symbols are a ""red line that cannot be crossed."" While rejecting what they described as ""violations,"" local officials called on all parties to ""resort to logic and wisdom and allow the security forces and the judiciary to take their natural course in this case,"" the statement said. The incident took place as Shiite Muslims prepare to observe Ashura, one of the holiest days in the Shiite calendar marking the death of Imam Hussain, a 7th century imam and the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. For decades under Saddam Hussein and his Sunni Arab dominated regime, the Shiite majority in Iraq were banned from practicing their religious rituals. Over the past decade since the fall of the regime, Shiite banners and flags with the images of Shiite figures have become more visible in Shiite-dominated areas of the country. CNN's Ashleigh Cowie in London and Salma Abdelaziz in Atlanta contributed to this report.","A mob of men drags a contractor out of a car and beats him, a video shows .

"(CNN) -- Terrorism causes fear, and we overreact to that fear. Our brains aren't very good at probability and risk analysis. We tend to exaggerate spectacular, strange and rare events, and downplay ordinary, familiar and common ones. We think rare risks are more common than they are, and we fear them more than probability indicates we should. Our leaders are just as prone to this overreaction as we are. But aside from basic psychology, there are other reasons that it's smart politics to exaggerate terrorist threats, and security threats in general. The first is that we respond to a strong leader. Bill Clinton famously said: ""When people feel uncertain, they'd rather have somebody that's strong and wrong than somebody who's weak and right."" He's right. The second is that doing something -- anything -- is good politics. A politician wants to be seen as taking charge, demanding answers, fixing things. It just doesn't look as good to sit back and claim that there's nothing to do. The logic is along the lines of: ""Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it."" The third is that the ""fear preacher"" wins, regardless of the outcome. Imagine two politicians today. One of them preaches fear and draconian security measures. The other is someone like me, who tells people that terrorism is a negligible risk, that risk is part of life, and that while some security is necessary, we should mostly just refuse to be terrorized and get on with our lives. Fast-forward 10 years. If I'm right and there have been no more terrorist attacks, the fear preacher takes credit for keeping us safe. But if a terrorist attack has occurred, my government career is over. Even if the incidence of terrorism is as ridiculously low as it is today, there's no benefit for a politician to take my side of that gamble. The fourth and final reason is money. Every new security technology, from surveillance cameras to high-tech fusion centers to airport full-body scanners, has a for-profit corporation lobbying for its purchase and use. Given the three other reasons above, it's easy -- and probably profitable -- for a politician to make them happy and say yes. For any given politician, the implications of these four reasons are straightforward. Overestimating the threat is better than underestimating it. Doing something about the threat is better than doing nothing. Doing something that is explicitly reactive is better than being proactive. (If you're proactive and you're wrong, you've wasted money. If you're proactive and you're right but no longer in power, whoever is in power is going to get the credit for what you did.) Visible is better than invisible. Creating something new is better than fixing something old. Those last two maxims are why it's better for a politician to fund a terrorist fusion center than to pay for more Arabic translators for the National Security Agency. No one's going to see the additional appropriation in the NSA's secret budget. On the other hand, a high-tech computerized fusion center is going to make front page news, even if it doesn't actually do anything useful. This leads to another phenomenon about security and government. Once a security system is in place, it can be very hard to dislodge it. Imagine a politician who objects to some aspect of airport security: the liquid ban, the shoe removal, something. If he pushes to relax security, he gets the blame if something bad happens as a result. No one wants to roll back a police power and have the lack of that power cause a well-publicized death, even if it's a one-in-a-billion fluke. We're seeing this force at work in the bloated terrorist no-fly and watch lists; agents have lots of incentive to put someone on the list, but absolutely no incentive to take anyone off. We're also seeing this in the Transportation Security Administration's attempt to reverse the ban on small blades on airplanes. Twice it tried to make the change, and twice fearful politicians prevented it from going through with it. Lots of unneeded and ineffective security measures are perpetrated by a government bureaucracy that is primarily concerned about the security of its members' careers. They know the voters are more likely to punish them more if they fail to secure against a repetition of the last attack, and less if they fail to anticipate the next one. What can we do? Well, the first step toward solving a problem is recognizing that you have one. These are not iron-clad rules; they're tendencies. If we can keep these tendencies and their causes in mind, we're more likely to end up with sensible security measures that are commensurate with the threat, instead of a lot of security theater and draconian police powers that are not. Our leaders' job is to resist these tendencies. Our job is to support politicians who do resist.

"(CNN) -- On Monday, a 5-4 majority of the U.S. Supreme Court approved strip searches of everyone entering jail after arrest for even the most minor offense. The ruling exposed a disturbing insensitivity. The plaintiffs in the case, Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, were arrested for relatively minor offenses, such as walking a dog without a leash. Their lawsuit challenged a policy in two New Jersey detention facilities where all arrested people are strip-searched before joining the inside population. In one facility, this means ""a complete disrobing, followed by an examination of the nude inmate ... by the supervising officer, which is then followed by a supervised shower with a delousing agent."" In the other facility, the booking process ""required groups of 30 to 40 arrestees to enter a large shower room, simultaneously remove all of their clothing, place it in boxes and then shower."" If you have ever driven over the speed limit in New Jersey, it could be you in that shower. The Supreme Court quite recently accepted the idea that the Constitution requires a greater justification for strip searches than for less-intrusive searches. In Safford v. Redding, decided in 2009, the court said that searches exposing the breasts and pelvic area were ""categorically distinct, requiring distinct elements of justification."" People in jails and prisons, however, have long enjoyed less privacy than free people. In Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court upheld a policy that subjected all detainees to visual body cavity searches after they had visitors. It emphasized that detention facilities had a special need for heightened security that weighs heavily against inmates' privacy. For similar reasons, the court in Florence ruled in favor of strip searches. No one would deny that U.S. prisons and jails are dangerous places filled with weapons, drugs and other contraband. Achieving security in such institutions is crucial. But that does not mean strip searches are either a necessary or an effective means of doing so. The Supreme Court has an obligation to protect the privacy of inmates by scrutinizing law enforcement policies that concern people who have not even gone to trial for their alleged misdemeanors. The court's failure to do so is an abdication of its responsibilities. Prison and jail officials have exceedingly difficult jobs and are entitled to flexibility in their efforts to secure the institutions they run. Strip searches, however, are extremely intrusive, humiliating and frequently traumatic, as the Supreme Court has acknowledged. Even in the Supreme Court building itself, where the need for security is undoubtedly great, guards do not strip search members of the public who come to watch oral arguments. Imagine the fallout if they did. The plaintiffs in Florence, it is worth remembering, are not very different from the crowds that gather outside the Supreme Court to hear oral arguments. They were not charged with or even suspected of drug-dealing, assault or other violent conduct. They are people who sometimes drive over the speed limit, who walk their dogs without a leash now and then and who might miss a child support payment on occasion. No one should have to undergo a strip search simply because she had the misfortune of being arrested and taken to jail for what almost everyone has done at one time or another. To rubber-stamp subjecting them to strip searches without any demonstrable need, without an iota of reasonable suspicion and without any evidence that such policies are effective is to perpetrate an injustice unworthy of our high court. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sherry Colb.","Sherry Colb: Supreme Court ruling on strip search was disturbingly insensitive .

"(CNN) -- November has recently transformed into ""Movember,"" the month for growing mustaches to raise money for fighting prostate cancer. Now, for those who aren't interested in the shaggy look -- or who might be ""follicly"" challenged -- there's another way to help another good cause: by cutting your locks. The Veterans of Foreign Wars is sponsoring the VFW Mane Event, a fund-raising effort that it says started when the Pittsburgh Steelers' Troy Polamalu offered to cut his famous hair -- for the first time in a decade -- to help veterans. ""My hair gets a lot of attention, and by cutting it after more than ten years, it is my hope that I can help bring to light the fate of our country's veterans,"" the NFL safety said on his VFW donation page. Polamalu, 32, will get his long locks trimmed on Monday, Veterans Day, in front of a crowd at Pittsburgh's Heinz Field, although it's unclear how much he'll actually get cut. Bleacher Report noted that Polamalu's Facebook post in September described a ""ceremonial"" haircut, and USAToday reported that he'll have only a lock trimmed at Monday's event, which it noted is being held in conjunction with his shampoo sponsor, Head & Shoulders. The VFW is encouraging others to participate by setting up a donation page, or just donate to Polamalu, to support their own haircuts on Veterans Day as a unique way to raise funds for veterans. The VFW released images of some shaggy participants' ""before"" photos on Twitter. Polamalu has raised more than $53,000 (you can donate to him here). The Mane Event is part of the VFW's United for Veterans initiative, which it says aims to ""bring awareness to VFW programs and services that work to alleviate veterans' struggles."" Polamalu is no stranger to supporting veterans' causes: He and his wife, Theodora, created the Harry Panos Fund for Veterans, named after Theodora's grandfather, who fought in World War II. If haircuts aren't your thing, there are many other simple ways you can help support veterans on Veterans Day or any day of the year: You can donate your frequent flier miles to help the Fisher House Foundation, which builds homes for the families of veterans caring for them during hospitalization. Or you can buy holiday cards from Puppies Behind Bars (PDF), one of many organizations that trains rescue dogs to help veterans with debilitating PTSD. Rescue dogs trained to rescue vets .

"(CNN) -- Robin Quivers, Howard Stern's radio program sidekick, revealed Monday that she has battled cancer for the past year. The revelation came following a question from a caller about when Quivers would be returning to the studio. She has been working her gig from home since May of last year. Stern explained that right before her last day in the studio, Quivers had been attending a wedding in Pittsburgh and found she was unable to urinate. A quick trip to the emergency room, where her bladder was drained using a catheter, didn't fix the problem, Stern said. ""Do you want to fill the audience in on what happened since then so that they understand why you haven't been in the studio?"" Stern asked Quivers during Monday's show. Quivers replied, ""Sure. I'm ready to talk about it now, I guess. Yeah, so I went to a doctor that afternoon and for about a week the story was that nobody really understood what was going on. They knew that there was a mass in my pelvis but nobody knew what it was, and eventually it was determined that I just had to have surgery and they'd figure it out after going in."" Quivers said she endured 12 hours of surgery after returning home to New York City. The mass turned out to be cancerous and involved uterine tissue migrating outside her uterus, she said. ""The tumor was about the size of a grapefruit,"" she said. ""There were two reasons that the operation was so long. It took eight hours to remove the tumor because it was so huge, it was lying on all the organs in my pelvis, and they literally had to scrape it off when they got to it. But also, they couldn't even figure out how to operate 'cause it was so massive."" Stern, who at times sounded emotional, said he was worried that his friend and cohort of many years would not survive. ""I was already making funeral arrangements,"" he said. ""Not to make light of this situation, but I was freaking out. It was just this f***ing crazy thing that came out of left field and it was going down real quick."" But the story has what Stern called a ""miraculous"" ending. After undergoing treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering -- which included chemotherapy and an ileostomy, a surgical procedure to allow intestinal waste to pass out of the body through an opening in the skin and into a pouch -- Quivers said doctors told her three and a half months ago that she is now cancer-free. ""(The doctor) just looks at everything and she goes, 'You're cured. You're done. You can just leave here. You know, the protocol is to scan you every three months and do all this stuff, but we don't really have to, because you're cured,'"" Quivers said. Stern, who Quivers said supported her through her illness, said he was overjoyed with the outcome. ""I can't tell you when you see a friend, a life-long friend, going through this, what it's like,"" Stern said. ""I'll be honest. I thought she was a goner. You bet against anybody else except Robin.""","Quivers kept her cancer diagnosis secret for over a year .

"(CNN) -- At the funeral of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, his good friend, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was photographed embracing Chávez's bereaved mother, in a show of compassion and support. Back home in Tehran, Ahmadinejad was immediately bashed by newspapers and by conservative politicians who cited a religious prohibition against touching a woman who is not your wife or a relative. While theology is a factor, there may have been a deeper message to this backlash from Tehran: that it's no longer cool to be supporting Chávez, his family and political allies, and that this alliance, like others cultivated by Chávez, may be in jeopardy. Chávez put great effort into his friendship with Iran and into a broader alliance with other states in Latin America, with both efforts motivated in part by opposition to the United States' international role. Chávez's death is certainly changing the political calculus in Venezuela, but will it also result in a broader shift that could realign much of Latin America and affect attitudes toward, and relationships with, the United States? The answer is likely ""yes."" First, the grouping of nations previously opposing the United States under Chávez's leftist alliance -- namely the ""Alba"" alliance, comprised of Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Bolivia -- could well wither away, due to Venezuela's ongoing recession and fears that alliance members will no longer have Venezuela's financial backing. When combined with reports of Chávez's expressed desire to strengthen ties with the Obama administration, regional hostility towards the United States may decline. Since assuming office in 1999, Chávez viewed Washington as an oppressive force manipulating Latin American politics while keeping the region underdeveloped through its dependence on U.S. resources. In response, Chávez approached like-minded leaders to build a coalition challenging the regional influence of the United States. By 2005, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Cuba, Honduras and Ecuador joined Chávez's coalition, which led to the formation of the Bolivian Alliance of the Americas, also known as Alba. Alba served as an alternative to the Free Trade Act of the Americas, with an explicit focus on poverty reduction, but it also facilitated the unification of these nations in their anti-American sentiments . With Chávez gone, however, there may be no one left who has the clout to keep financing this alliance. Venezuela is Alba's largest financier, contributing millions in aid to its members as well as oil at low prices. But Venezuelans may believe that with ongoing poverty and inequality, their country's needs are more important than those of Chávez's small club of nations. This situation worries Alba members. According to Cynthia Arnson of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, while Bolivia and Ecuador are independently wealthy and not financially dependent on Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua are. Cuba receives roughly 100,000 barrels of Venezuelan oil a day, while Venezuela accounted for $8.3 billion of Cuba's $20 billion in foreign trade in 2011. Chávez also paid approximately $6 billion annually for 40,000 Cuban doctors and nurses, according to Reuters. Cuban citizens fear that Chávez's death will push them back to the days of the post-Cold War recession, when Russia gradually withdrew its funding for Cuba. Meanwhile, Nicaragua has received approximately $500 million a year in loans and oil credits, increasing to $609 million in 2011, while earnings from agricultural exports to Venezuela increased from $2 million in 2006 to $300 million in 2011. But alliance members also realize that they have options. Nicaragua's economic minister, Bayardo Arce, recently stated that it's time to diversify Nicaragua's economic relations with China, Europe and the United States, mainly because Nicaragua has ""to anticipate that Alba is not going to be permanent."" Cuba may also seek to strengthen its relations with Brazil, its second-largest trade partner in the region. In fact, both governments already have plans to engage in several trade and infrastructure projects and are ramping up trade, mainly in sugar exports. Ecuador and Nicaragua are working more closely with Brazil in helping to construct hydroelectric energy plants and chemical industries, respectively. In addition to strong economic growth rates, Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff's policy commitments to the poor and enhanced control over key economic sectors, such as oil, may provide a more appealing leftist model. In recent years, Chávez was also interested in improving relations with the United States. He saw President Obama's re-election victory as an opportunity to strengthen diplomatic ties. Chávez once commented: ""I wish we could begin a new period of normal relations."" Chávez was so committed to this endeavor that even from his hospital in Cuba, he authorized his second in command, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, to start negotiating with the U.S. State Department. While it may seem that Maduro may have a difficult time working with the United States, considering his accusations that the United States has historically plotted against Venezuela and the recent removal of U.S. diplomats from Caracas, it appears that this was mainly done to gain the trust of Chávez political supporters in order to secure Maduro's position as the next president. U.S. diplomatic officials view Maduro as a pragmatist and the fact that he was supportive of initiating closer ties with the United States last year suggests that this could continue, especially in light of Venezuela's economic troubles and the need to increase revenues through trade. Chávez's passing should motivate the United States to seek a new partnership with Venezuela. First, Secretary of State John Kerry should reopen the U.S. embassy in Caracas, which has been closed since 2010, while assigning diplomats who are committed to engaging in peaceful dialogue and political and economic cooperation. Second, Kerry should take this opportunity to strengthen cooperation over issues that can provide mutual benefits in the areas of national security and the economy, such as counternarcotics, counterterrorism, as well as sustaining oil trade: the United States currently imports just under 1 million barrels a day from Venezuela. But the United States should also see this situation as an opportunity to strengthen its ties with other nations, such as Cuba. With the likely decline in economic assistance to Cuba from Venezuela, Cuban President Raul Castro may consider stepping up negotiations with the Obama administration over the U.S. embargo, human rights and the release of American prisoners, such as Alan Gross. Chávez is gone, but the United States' commitment to peaceful democratic relations persists. Going forward, the United States should explore ways of strengthening its ties with Venezuela and other Latin American nations. But this is not a one-way street: Maduro in Venezuela will also need to find ways to strengthen his government's ties with the United States, which may be a balancing act if he wants to sustain his government's good relations with Iran, particularly after Ahmadinejad leaves office. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eduardo J. Gómez .","Eduardo J. Gómez: Ahmadinejad criticized back home for hugging Chávez's mother .

"(CNN) -- You can be sure of one thing. Gore Vidal hates being dead. Unless of course we die and go somewhere where you can write, drink, have sex, appear on TV and, above all else, talk. I once asked Gore his philosophy of how to conduct your life. The immediate answer: ""Never turn down an opportunity for sex or being on TV."" He wrote enough for 10 men. Aside from his prodigious output of novels, historic and political essays, movies, TV scripts and hit plays, he was -- I feel safe in saying -- the best talker since Oscar Wilde. I got to spend a lot of time with Gore, on and off the air, and there was always a sort of afterglow. You felt you had just had a lovely bath in the elegant and witty use of our sadly declining English language. Gore's talk, if transcribed, could be printed without editing. If there seemed to be some preening in his prepared remarks on television -- and he knew a good line was worth repeating -- it was outweighed by the quality of the verbal prose. In my notorious show known now through the ages as ""Cavett's Mailer/Vidal Fight,"" there was a particular answer of Gore's to a challenge by Norman Mailer that actually got applause for, I think, its simple elegance: Gore had gotten a laugh, a feat difficult for Mailer to achieve. The exchange went: . Mailer: Why don't you try to talk just once, Gore, without yuks? Why not just talk to me instead of talking to the audience? Vidal: Well, by a curious thing we have not found ourselves in a friendly neighborhood bar, but both, by election, are sitting here with an audience, so therefore it would be dishonest of us to pretend otherwise (applause). Hard to imagine Mitt Romney fashioning that sentence. Much ink was spilled all over the country about that show. Asked by a journalist what comment he had about Mailer's head-butting him backstage, Gore said, ""Once again, words failed Norman Mailer."" Opinion: Vidal's magnificent strengths, appalling weaknesses . My late wife and Gore became great friends. They laughed constantly together, often on the subject of their mutual knowledge of dwelling in the American South. Gore's favorite was her description of an elegant family dinner table in Mississippi with much lace and candles and crystal and the elderly matriarch -- bedecked in rich brocade and a jeweled tiara -- making her way unsteadily to the table after a touch or two of bourbon and Seconal upstairs. Moments later, when she pitched forward into the cold soup, a family member, wielding a napkin and skilled in Deep South euphemism, would invariably say, ""Mama's tired."" Gore later signed a book to my late wife, ""For Carrie Nye: So tah'd. Gore."" She always said of him that for a man who describes himself as bisexual, ""Gore really, really likes women."" Like all writers (it's almost safe to say) he was a big drinker. (See Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Cheever, Mailer, et al.) I once startled Gore by saying I'd just read that each drink kills more than 10,000 brain cells. He paled. ""But you've got billions of brain cells,"" I reassured him. Gore responded: ""But I've had billions of drinks."" Quotes of his are collected. It would be hard to dislike a man who was opposed to gay marriage ""... because heterosexual marriage is such a disaster, why would anyone want to imitate it?"" Or of Andy Warhol: ""The only genius I've ever known with an IQ of 60."" Opinion: My friend, il maestro Gore Vidal . I don't have Gore's exact wording, but he once urged the idea that anyone who professes himself qualified to run for president of the United States should be immediately stopped and prevented from doing so. He once made the statement -- only partially seriously? -- that the country's problems were all potentially curable by the simple method of listening to what he said. He ran the only witty political campaign this side of Adlai Stevenson. He likely would not have made a great occupant of the Oval Office, but imagine the fun of those press conferences! I once did a half-hour show, seen on PBS, with Gore from his fabulous castle-like home perched above a gorgeous valley at Ravello, Italy. Jet lag awoke me early one morning, and I peeked into his closed writing room. An old-style Royal typewriter sat at the precise center of a long, heavy antique table. Books extended outward from both sides of the typewriter for a couple of feet in both directions, all of them written by the occupant. I closed the door again, quietly, and got my breath. The fact that some feel his greatest work is in his collected essays should be a word to the wise. They're stunning. What a man and what a loss. I don't see how anyone could say or think anything negative about one who said, ""Success is not enough. One's friends must fail."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dick Cavett.","Dick Cavett: Unless there's debauchery, talk in the afterlife, Gore Vidal hates being dead .

"(CNN) -- It seems North Korea's new leader Kim Jong Un is carrying on his father's strange tradition: mixing a fascination with American culture with a hatred of the United States. Kim has made it quite clear that his country's February nuclear test marks a new phase of confrontation with the United States, which Pyongyang has described as ""the sworn enemy of the Korean people."" Opinion: How to deal with North Korea . Yet that hasn't stopped Pyongyang from welcoming a few dignitaries from this ""sworn enemy"" nation, including a top Google executive and a few basketball stars. No one knows if it's all part of an organized effort to woo North Korea into diplomacy by appealing to its leader's interest in American culture. Yet one thing is for sure: This love-hate relationship has sparked some odd stories out of the Hermit Kingdom. Here's a look at some of the most recent ones we've come across: . 1. Kim Jong Un: Dennis Rodman's new BFF . If you read the reports about former NBA star Dennis Rodman's visit to Pyongyang, you might have double-checked whether the story was just another Onion parody. Not only did the American basketball star -- known for his over-the-top publicity stunts -- visit North Korea, but he also was joined by three members of the famed Harlem Globetrotters, who played against North Korea's ""Dream Team"" (no surprise, the game ended in a tie). Rodman proclaimed Kim ""a friend for life,"" and appeared courtside with the North Korean leader. Not everyone was cheering this so-called ""basketball diplomacy."" A commentary in Canada's National Post outlined North Korea's ""monstrous gulag system that Dennis Rodman will never see."" And CNN contributor John Avlon wrote that Rodman isn't the only ""celebrity to be used for publicity purposes to prop up a dictator."" North Korea issues threat to U.S. military . 2. Google executive urges country with barely any electricity to embrace the Internet . You've probably seen that NASA satellite photo of the Korean peninsula at night, the one that shows the northern half completely dark while the southern half and the Chinese coast are fully alight. Electricity is still a luxury in North Korea, where cold winds from nearby Siberia can plunge temperatures below freezing. But that didn't stop Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt from visiting North Korea in January as part of a delegation urging North Korea to ""make it possible for people to use the Internet."" While many North Koreans might be more interested in having a heated home, Schmidt and his Google colleague Jared Cohen have advocated about the Internet's ability to empower citizens living under oppressive regimes. 3. Famous Americans apparently aren't the only ones heading to Pyongyang . In the wake of the Schmidt and Rodman visits, Bloomberg Businessweek looked at just how many Westerners are heading to North Korea for its closely monitored, government-run tours. Surprisingly, it found a nearly 20% increase in visits since 2011. 4. Get your North Korean education ... in Tokyo . The United States isn't the only outside country that has a love-hate relationship with North Korea. Until the end of World War II, Korea was a Japanese colony, and many Koreans were brought to Japan -- many against their will -- before Korea was divided between north and south. More recently, North Korea admitted to kidnapping Japanese citizens from Japanese soil in the 1970s and 1980s, something Tokyo has demanded more answers about. Despite this tense history, Japan hosts a number of North Korean-funded schools -- complete with portraits of North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung and previous leader Kim Jong Il on its walls. Students, who are mostly Japanese, say they are learning Korean culture and language, and laugh off suggestions that they're training to be spies. 5. Dreaming of annihilating the United States, to the tune of 'We Are The World' It's no secret that North Korea's propaganda images are bizarre, at least to the non-North Korean eye. If this doesn't make sense, just search Google Images for ""North Korea propaganda."" Yet one video released in the run-up to North Korea's nuclear test on Pyongyang's official website still managed to raise some eyebrows. The video -- set to the tune of ""We Are The World,"" the 1985 song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie heralding world peace -- shows a North Korean man dreaming about an apparent missile attack on the United States.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The widening fallout from an increasingly volatile territorial dispute between China and Japan prompted a Japanese company to halt work at plants in China on Monday, and the United States to urge the two sides to avoid letting the situation spiral out of control. The electronics company Panasonic said Monday that it was suspending operations at three plants in China after two of them were damaged amid violent anti-Japanese protests set off by the clash between Beijing and Tokyo over a group of small islands in the East China Sea. Japan calls the islands Senkaku; China calls them Diaoyu. Background: How remote rock split China, Japan . The United States, a key military ally of Japan, has called on the two sides to find a peaceful resolution to the disagreement, which is generating more and more unease in the region and starting to hurt economic links between the world's second and third largest economies. ""It's in everybody's interest for Japan and China to maintain good relations and to find a way to avoid further escalation,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday at a joint new conference in Tokyo with his Japanese counterpart, Satoshi Morimoto. Despite describing the U.S.-Japan alliance as the ""bedrock of peace and stability"" in the Asia-Pacific region, Panetta reiterated that Washington doesn't take a position on competing sovereignty claims. He did, however, express concern about the demonstrations in China. Parts of Panasonic's facilities in Qingdao, Shandong Province, and Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, were damaged by anti-Japanese protestors on Saturday, the company said. It is halting work at the factories until Tuesday, it said, as well as at a plant in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, where some employees have staged a strike over the island issue. Unrest took place in dozens of other cities in China over the weekend. Thousands of protesters hurled bottles and eggs outside the Japanese Embassy in Beijing on Saturday, expressing anger over Tokyo's announcement last week that it had acquired several of the disputed islands from a Japanese family to bring them under public ownership. China declared the purchase to be ""illegal"" and sent six surveillance vessels to carry out patrols on Friday around the remote islands in an effort to underscore its claim to sovereignty. The ships briefly entered Japanese territorial waters despite warnings not to do so, the Japanese Coast Guard said. The islands, situated in the East China Sea between Okinawa and Taiwan, are under Japanese control, but China claims they have been a part of its territory ""since ancient times."" Asia's disputed islands -- who claims what? The events last week ratcheted up the tensions between the two East Asian nations, where lingering resentment from past conflicts remains close to the surface. That was in evidence in Beijing at the weekend. Waving Chinese national flags and holding portraits of the late leader Mao Zedong, the mostly young protesters chanted ""down with Japanese imperialism"" and called for war as they made their way down the streets under the watchful eyes of police and guards. Messages and photos posted on Chinese social media sites showed angry mobs in numerous cities ransacking Japanese stores and restaurants as well as smashing and burning cars of Japanese make. In the southern industrial city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, a protest Sunday in front of a local Communist Party office over the island dispute descended into violence when the security forces moved in, said resident Ronald Rossi. The demonstrators began smashing large plant pots and other objects in the street so they could throw the shards at the police, Rossi said. The anti-Japanese tone of the protest was clear from the slogans and images on display, he added. Japanese news media organizations have also reported incidents of assaults on Japanese citizens in China in the past few days. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman insisted Friday that the public anger was not aimed at the Japanese people, whose safety would be protected in China according to law. The authorities rarely permit protests in China, prompting suspicion that the nationwide rallies over the weekend were government-sanctioned. In Beijing, police walking alongside the demonstrators were seen to ask spectators to join in instead of blocking the street. By Saturday night, China's state-run media had started appealing for restraint, running commentaries that condemned violence and lectured the public on the expression of patriotism. In a sign of rising concern over the gathering of large crowds, the authorities in cities that had seen the most ferocious protests canceled entertainment and sporting events. ""Violence cannot be tolerated simply because the protests are aimed at Japan,"" said an editorial published Monday by the Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party. On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Japanese Embassy in Beijing appeared to blocked off by the authorities. After his meetings in Japan, Panetta is due to travel to China, where he will meet with ""top military and civilian leaders including Defense Minister Gen. Liang Guanglie,"" according to the Pentagon. Animosity between China and Japan over the disputed islands runs deep. They have come to represent what many Chinese see as unfinished business: redressing the impact of the Japanese occupation of large swathes of eastern China during the 1930s and 1940s. China says its claim goes back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. A public initiative begun in April this year by the outspoken governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, to raise money to acquire the islands for the city authorities set off a new cycle of tensions that included civilian protesters from both sides landing on the islands to stake their nations' claims. Ishihara's move put pressure on the government of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to step in with its own bid, which resulted in the controversial deal last week with the Kurihara family, the private owners up until that point. Japan's attempts to portray the purchase as a routine internal real-estate transaction, with the islands passing from one Japanese owner to another, has failed to placate the Chinese authorities.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Chicago man who planned to travel to Somalia to fight for a terrorist group pleaded guilty on Monday to terrorism-related charges. Shaker Masri, a 28-year old U.S. citizen, pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support for Al-Shabaab, a group he knew the United States had designated as a foreign terrorist organization, according to prosecutors. In his plea agreement, Masri said that on July 19, 2010, he told an associate he ""wanted to travel to a conflict zone to engage in jihadist fighting"" and that he had the choice of going to Afghanistan to help al Qaeda or travel to Somalia to aid Al-Shabaab. Masri told his associate he had decided to go to Somalia but he needed money. The associate -- who was actually a source assisting law enforcement -- said he would help Masri but insisted on going to join Al-Shabaab as well. Masri agreed, according to the plea agreement. Over several weeks Masri and his associate worked on their travel plans including ""how to conceal their departure, the financial costs of the journey, the necessity of supplies, and the weapons they would need to acquire in Somalia."" The plea agreement says the associate asked Masri how they would link up with Al-Shabaab once they arrived in Somalia. Masri explained that they would be traveling to a part of southern Somalia that was controlled by Al-Shabaab and said ""he expected that they would be placed with a brigade of al-Shabaab's militia comprised of foreign fighters."" According to the plea agreement, Masri said to avoid suspicion they should not travel directly to East Africa. Instead Masri decided on a route through California, Mexico, and then a ""Latin or South American country that did not work with United States' law enforcement"" and then on to East Africa. Masri told his associate that once they left for Somalia they would be ""wanted men."" Masri also told his associate that he needed to get rid of his laptop because it had information that could be incriminating, and buy a new one. In late July Masri and the man he believed to be his co-conspirator purchased one-way tickets to California to begin their circuitous journey. On August 3, 2010 -- the day before their scheduled departure -- Masri and his associate drove to a liquor store where the associate allegedly picked up $18,000 to fund their trip. Next they went to a store to buy a new laptop. Masri was arrested when he left the store. Earlier in his case Masri also was charged with attempting or conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction outside the United States. A criminal complaint charged he wanted to wear a suicide vest and become a martyr with an attack on ""infidels."" Under the terms of the plea agreement that charge was dropped. Masri is scheduled to be sentenced on October 16, and his plea agreement calls for a sentence of nine years and 10 months in prison on the conspiracy to provide material support charge.
