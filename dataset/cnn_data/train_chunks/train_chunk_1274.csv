"At 5ft 2"" tall and tipping the scales at just under 6st, Laura Davison, now 30, from Weston-super-Mare, thought she would never become a mother. Diagnosed with anorexia in her teens, she endured two stints in therapy before meeting her partner, Del, in 2004. Much to her surprise, she soon became pregnant but despite her happiness, her anorexia never completely went away, with Laura surviving on just two pieces of toast a day during her third and most recent pregnancy. Happy family: Laura, holding her daughter Katie, with son Michael, partner Del and oldest son Daniel . Unwell: Laura, pictured while pregnant with Katie, was living on just two slices of toast a day . Now mother to Daniel, eight, Michael, seven and baby Katie, Laura says she hopes the birth of her youngest child will help her turn the corner and become the mother she's always wanted to be. 'I was first diagnosed with anorexia when I was about 16 but had issues long before that,' explains Laura, who appears on tonight's episode of One Born Every Minute. 'Although I was never fat, I used to eat a lot and I do remember a girl at school saying to me if you carry on eating like that, you're going to get fat. 'So I cut out chocolate and crisps and lost a little bit of weight and it spiralled from there. 'At my worst, I was eating one rich tea biscuit a day.' Although dangerously ill, Laura managed to pass her GCSEs and combined school work with a demanding weekend job, which she says was 'like exercise'. At 18, she was hospitalised and spent time at The Priory in Bristol before being transferred to the Birmingham branch. Doctors, horrified by her inability to fight off the disease, warned her that she risked being unable to have children. But even that wasn't enough to stop Laura. 'It upset me, the thought of it,' she remembers. 'I wasn't getting periods because I was so underweight but at the time, I was so in the grip of the eating disorder, I didn't care.' Not well: Laura first became ill in her teens and is pictured on the left at 15 and on the right aged 16 at her prom . First recovery: Laura pictured aged 17 after being discharged from the Riverside Unit - a clinic for unwell teens . As with any illness, anorexia can result in problems during pregnancy. 'The are a number of potential effects of . anorexia,' explains Jane Munro of the Royal College of Midwives. 'Among them are a low birth weight baby, miscarriage and . stillbirth, premature birth and an increased chance of having a . caesarean section. 'The mother is also more likely to develop  postnatal depression if she suffers from anorexia. 'A healthy  diet is vital  for both the baby and mother throughout pregnancy and after the birth.' But Laura's life was about to change dramatically - and for the better - when she met and fell in love with her partner Del. Much . to the couple's delight, within months of striking up a relationship . and against all the odds, the 20-year-old found herself pregnant. 'We were only together for five months . before I fell pregnant,' says Laura. 'We thought there was no point using . contraceptives because we thought I wouldn't be able to have children.' And with her maternal instincts kicking in, Laura found herself eating properly for the first time in years. 'I would eat chips for breakfast,' she chuckles. 'Potatoes were my craving. My eating disorder was never about hurting . anyone else, just myself, and my maternal instincts took over.' But six months after Daniel was born by emergency caesarian, the anorexia returned. By now pregnant with her second child, the stress of juggling the demands of a tiny baby and a pregnancy left Laura struggling. 'From the outside, I looked like a happy . mum,' she reveals. 'But because of the caesarian, I found it harder to bond with Daniel and although I did fall in love with him when he was about three months old, the stress of being pregnant again so soon led to it coming back. Looking up: Laura with her partner Del, who she met aged 20. She credits him with helping to beat the illness . Not easy: Laura aged 19 in The Priory just before she met Del. She weighed just 5st 8lb at the time . 'It wasn't all the time but it was there. The clothes I was wearing . were maternity but a size 10. I think I was OK. I was small but not too bad.' By the end of her pregnancy, Laura, who says she spent most of the nine months on a diet of a breakfast of bran flakes with milk and a dinner of spaghetti Bolognese, weighed just 9st 5lbs. Although at 7.5lbs baby Michael was smaller than her older son, he was healthy and Laura was besotted. But once again, her anorexia returned - this time triggered by the stress of juggling two small sons with an increasingly busy job. 'I was working in a solicitors office in Bristol and I can remember throwing up in the office toilet,' she remembers. 'We were dealing with home repossessions which went up from 20 to 100 in a week after the recession began. 'I felt like I wasn't giving 100 per cent at home or work - compounded by feeling awful for leaving the boys and for not being able to do my job as well as I wanted.' Weighing just 6st 6lbs, Laura's problems were made worse by a litany of health problems that included foot surgery and having a lump removed from her breast. 'I started with two slices of toast, the one flapjack at lunch and I would try and eat evening meal,' says Laura. 'I started throwing that up and then the same with flapjack at work. Once I was signed off work, I would vomit up to 20 times a day. 'The children were never around when I did it and I would eat meals with everyone but Del would do most of the parenting.' Happier: Laura is determined to beat anorexia for the sake of all three children and for partner Del . High hopes: Laura wants to be a wonderful mother to her children and says she will beat anorexia . The pressure proved too much for the couple to handle and they split up for two years before getting back together again in 2012. But anorexia was still casting its shadow over Laura's life and when she became pregnant for a third time, dealing with it became more difficult than ever. This time, the trigger was a court case . following an assault by a former boyfriend. Unable to cope with the . stress, Laura was living on a single slice of toast and peanut butter a . day. 'I did have a lot of support from the midwife,' says Laura, 'but I was under . a lot of stress and pressure and I felt bad that I wasn't able to eat normally . for her. 'Later she found me a dietician and I increased what I was eating to two . slices of toast and peanut butter and one apple a day.' By the end of her pregnancy, Laura weighed just 8st 3lb, much of it baby, and was warned that she faced a riskier than normal birth as a result. Luckily, daughter Katie was born healthy, although at 6lb 12oz, she weighed considerably less than her older brothers had. Although Laura says she is still struggling with her eating and is currently back on her pregnancy routine of two slices of toast and peanut butter a day, she is positive that she'll find a way to beat the disease. 'I'm maintaining my weight,' she says. 'I feel positive that I'm keeping my weight on and I'm . not getting worse. If I start the day good and I end the day good, . that's enough. 'The healthier I am, the more I can do with the children,' she adds. 'They are my motivation. If I didn't have them, I might not still be here.

"Picture of innocence: Victorian and Edwardian children were supposed to be seen and not heard but records how the reality was quite different . The Victorian era was a golden age . for the middle classes. Industrialists, bankers and clerks were all able . to send their children to school to the age of 12 or 14. In . this age of prosperity and enlightenment they were expected to be . well-dressed, good-mannered and most importantly - seen and not heard. But new research carried out at the University of Manchester suggests children were every bit as unruly as they are today. PhD student Ruth Colton . examined the history of some of the country's most-used parks in London, . Yorkshire, Manchester and Newcastle, which were designed to promote . social harmony but became a magnet for anti-social behaviour. After . sifting through postcards, public records, archaeology and children’s . literature from the period, the Ms Colton found the children weren’t . always the little angels we might think they were. She said: 'I don't agree that Victorian and Edwardian children were to be seen and not heard. 'It was supposed to be the golden age . for middle class children, who . were depicted as angels or fairies in advertisements and literature. 'But children and children’s play was a prominent feature of parks and . one which was framed by class. 'Working class children, depicted as street urchins, were given a less . positive spin, but parks were thought to be a good way to purify and . improve them.' Disorder: Whitworth Park in Manchester was one of many opened with the intention of promoting social harmony . She added: 'And like today, there was a rowdy and unpredictable side . too: while parks were supposed to promote social harmony, this was often . resisted and parks could be sites of conflict and contrast. 'Newspapers reported that children and youths were sitting on park benches shouting abuse at passers-by. 'Children would also illegally fish in park lakes for ornamental fish or steal fruit of the trees.' The . parks Ms Colton studied include Whitworth Park in Manchester, Roundwood Park . and Vauxhall Park in London, Greenhead Park in Huddersfield and Saltwell . Park in Gateshead. Objects . excavated in Whitworth Park by The University of Manchester led . Community Archaeology Project, of which Ms Colton is part, showed that . eating food and drinking alcohol, forbidden in the park bye-laws, took . place in the park. The team . have unearthed marbles from the tops of Codd bottles alongside the more . expensive coloured glass marbles, showing how children from different . social classes played and competed together. Five . stones – a game similar to jacks - was also found at the Manchester . Park. Made of ceramic, they are among the earliest examples of toy . manufacture. She said: . 'Excavated material showed how parks were one of the few places where . social classes could mix and compete against each other, particularly . children. 'I hope that my work will inform our understanding of the parks’ heritage and in doing so will help to inform a vision for their future. 'Children have always had a wild side to their nature;  kids will be kids and this is as true today as it was in the Victorian and Edwardian eras.'","New research casts doubt on myth that children were 'seen and not heard'

"Notorious Serbian-Swedish gangster Milo 'Mille' Markovic has been found dead with four bullet wounds to his head in Stockholm. The 52-year-old was shot dead while sitting in a car outside his home in Ulvsunda, in the western part of the Swedish capital, just after 6pm last night, the engine still running. Markovic was unofficially credited as one of the sources for the controversial 2010 biography about the King of Sweden in which the monarch was accused of attending strip clubs and having extramarital affairs. Crime scene: Police and forensic officers investigate the car where gangster Mille Markovic was found shot dead in Stockholm . Gangster: The 52-year-old Serbian-Swede was found dead outside his west Stockholm home, bullet wounds to his head, in his car with the engine still running . 'It sounded like fireworks,' a witness told Aftonbladet. 'Then I saw two men in dark clothing from afar.' 'They were standing by a car where the sound of fireworks came from. One of them said ""he is dead"".' Markovic gained fame as the owner of 'porn club' Prive and is said to have been one of the main sources for The Reluctant Monarch, a biography of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. The book revealed that the king and his friends had enjoyed the company of 'coffee girls' - women who would 'entertain' the group, consisting of members of the remains of Swedish aristocracy. It also alleged that the king visited underground strip clubs, and that he had been involved in an extramarital affair with a famous Swedish singer in the 90s. Reluctant monarch: Markovic claimed to have photographs of King Carl XVI Gustaf with naked strippers, and was one of the sources for a biography which claimed the king visited sex clubs and cheated on Queen Silvia . Following the publication of the book Markovic claimed that he had compromising photographs of the king with naked women, taken at one of his sex clubs in the 1980s. Markovic had lived under threat for 'a long time' and had been wearing a Kevlar vest as a precaution, a police source told Aftonbladet. According to the source, the reason why Markovic was shot in the head may have been that his killers knew he was wearing the protective vest. Today, Swedish tabloid Expressen revealed that Markovic may have caught his own murder on camera as he had at least two CCTV cameras in operation outside his house. Police are looking for two men said to have left the scene in a white Toyota, but refused to comment on the possible CCTV footage. In cold blood: Mille Markovic was shot four times in the head while sitting in the front seat of his car, seen here being towed from the scene . Rumours: Stockholm police are still investigating the scene as an inside source told a newspaper that Markovic may have been shot in the head as his killers knew he was wearing a protective vest . Investigation: Police are securing evidence at the scene where witnesses say they saw two men in dark clothes last night following the shots . Markovic, a 70s boxing champion, was born in Serbia but fled to Sweden with his father as a young child, becoming a neutralized citizen in 1982. The 52-year-old former porn-club owner had a long history of criminal activity, with previous convictions of assault, tax crimes, and preparing to blackmail world-famous tennis ace Bjorn Borg. Markovic had planned to lure Borg to Club Prive, and there take photographs of him having sex with one of his 'girls'. Last year he was charged with attempted murder in connection with a shooting at his former club, but the case was dropped after a witness retracted statements during the trial.","Former 'porn club king' Mille Markovic shot dead in Stockholm .

"Sergio Busquets was the unlikely hero for Barcelona, scoring with the last kick of the game to give Luis Enrique’s side a 1-0 win over Valencia and close the gap on Real Madrid to two points. There were 93 minutes on the clock when Lionel Messi drifted out to the right and crossed for Neymar to head goalwards. Valencia keeper Diego Alves made the save but Busquets scored from the rebound and as Messi and Co celebrated he was hit by a plastic bottle as home supporters pelted the pitch. Valencia had defended well and gone close themselves with former Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo drawing the best save of the game from Claudio Bravo. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Valencia 0-1 Barcelona . Neymar appears to headbutt Nicolas Otamendi as the Argentinian defender remonstrates with the Brazilian at the Mestalla . Otamendi falls to the floor in theatrical fashion, but Neymar had forcefully moved his head towards the Valencia man's jaw . The incident came after Otamendi had challenged Neymar inside the penalty area early on in the first half . Otamendi won the ball fairly, but looked unhappy at the way Neymar fell to the floor, and quickly moved towards the Barcelona man . The frustration had previously been all Barcelona’s. Luis Suarez thought he had scored his first league goal for the visitors after 68 minutes but it was incorrectly ruled out for offside - the Uruguayan was level with the last Valencia defender. There was a lively start to the first half with Jeremy Mathieu booked for chopping down Negredo. Valencia forced their first chance on 10 minutes when Rodrigo Moreno was foiled by Claudio Bravo. But although they had the early upper hand it was Barcelona who had the best opportunity of the first half and it fell to Suarez. Gerard Pique played a long ball out of defence which Neymar cleverly flicked into Suarez’s path. The ball dropped it front of him around the penalty spot but Diego Alves in the Valencia goal made the save. On 20 minutes Neymar went down dramatically under a challenge from Nicolas Otamendi and as if to do out-do his opponent the defender responded to the Brazilian inclining his head towards him as he bent down to remonstrate with him for diving by throwing himself down in the penalty area. In the resulting melee neither Neymar nor Otamendi’s amateur dramatics were punished as yellow cards were shown to Pique and to Antonio Barragan. Former Tottenham midfielder Nayim said on Sky Sports: 'My opinion is I don't think he's done enough to get a red card' With Otamendi's hands around the back of his neck, a frustrated Neymar appears to heatbutt the defender . Luis Suarez looks on with frustration after going close to scoring for Barcelona against Valencia on Sunday evening . Diego Alves looks crestfallen as Barcelona snatch a late winner to keep them just two points off rivals Real Madrid at the top of La Liga . VIDEO Enrique happy with 'complete' Barca . With Alves, Jordi Alba and Mustafi all also booked, six of the eight defenders on the pitch had to face the second half on a yellow card. Andre Gomez so nearly made sure that Valencia started that second 45 minutes in front but with one shot that curled just wide and another effort into the side-netting right on the half-time whistle he failed to break the deadlock. Suarez went close again at the start of the second half but he shot into the side-netting with only a defender to beat on the line after Diego Alves came out of his goal but failed to reach the ball. Bravo was also beaten moments later but Pique was on hand to clear off the line. Barca coach Enrique brought on Ivan Rakitic for Mathieu and put Javier Mascherano back into the centre of defence. The change almost had an instant effect with Suarez turning in Dani Alves’ pass from the edge of the six-yard box. He was level with the last defender and the goal should have stood. The bottle is seen thrown from the crowd in Valencia as the visiting players celebrated the late winner . Lionel Messi goes down clutching his head in stoppage time after being hit over the head with a bottle . Messi is clearly in pain after being struck on the head by the object in the closing stages of the contest . Midfield man Busquets celebrates after scoring a last-gasp winner for the Catalan giants against Valencia . Valencia responded immediately with Negredo releasing Sofiane Feghouli but Bravo saved well to keep the shot out. And the Barca stopper then produced the save of the night when Negredo rifled a left foot shot goalward. Pedro and Rafinha came on for Suarez and Xavi with 10 minutes left but on a night when Messi – without any pending records to smash – was barely involved it looked like ending in a stalemate that would have suited Real Madrid more than the two teams on the pitch. But the Argentinian forward came alive in the last moments of the game. Otamendi had to slide in to deny him with the penultimate chance of the game. And, not to be denied, he then crossed for Busquets to get the winner. Messi looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia . Gerard Pique argues with the referee as Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves, as Neymar went unpunished .

Couric jokingly dubbed her new husband a 'Groomzilla,' adding that he was very involved in the wedding planning - but he quipped: 'If this wedding was going to happen, I had to get involved.' During their vows, which they had written themselves, she promised 'not to check email' during the wedding. Molner's children, 16-year-old Allie and 19-year-old Henry read from E.E.

"On the lawn of a hotel garden next to the Mediterranean, the blackening bodies of 53 people lay decomposing. Some had their hands bound together, and bloodstains and spent rifle cartridges on the grass indicated they had been summarily executed where they fell. It was a scene from hell, but perhaps most chilling was the realisation that these were not victims of Muammar Gaddafi’s brutality. Horror: Corpses in the hotel gardenon the shore of the Mediterranean . Rather they were, the evidence would suggest, victims of the ‘good guys’, the supposedly democratic new friends of the West who have been ushered into power by Britain, France and the U.S. For the bloodbath was in Gaddafi’s stronghold of Sirte, and although the perpetrators are unknown, triumphalist graffiti on the walls of the hotel proclaimed the names of five Misrata-based fighting groups. Arguably, they suffered the greatest losses, and possibly fought the most intense battles, during the bloody siege of Libya’s third-largest city when Gaddafi threw everything he had at crushing the revolution there. Few of the young Misrata fighters would not have witnessed friends and comrades dying in agonising circumstances. Was this, a massacre at the Mahari Hotel in Gaddafi’s home town, their terrible revenge? There are growing concerns about possible war crimes by rebel fighters who helped to oust Gaddafi and now regard themselves as above the law. Deserted: Sirte - the last Gaddafi stronghold to fall to the rebels - has become an eerie ghost town . Eerie: As the house where Gaddafi hid stands in the background, a man walks in another part of Sirte, where residents are slowly starting to return . The New York-based Human Rights Watch yesterday demanded an inquiry into the atrocity at the hotel, warning of a ‘trend of killings, looting and other abuses’ by those who triumphed over Gaddafi thanks only to the support of Britain’s armed forces and those of our allies. Sirte residents have placed most of the bodies at the Mahari Hotel in bags and have been taking them away for burial. They identified four of the dead as Ezzidin al-Hinsheri, allegedly a former Gaddafi government official, a military officer named Muftah Dabroun, and two Sirte residents, Amar Mahmoud Saleh and Muftah al-Deley. The state of decomposition suggests the victims died at the same time, between October 14 and 19, says Human Rights Watch. Gruesome: Burnt out cars and bodies of Gadaffi bodyguards litter the area outside the Libyan coastal town of Sirte close to the drainage sewer from which Gadaffi was dragged alive . Hotel from hell: The entrance to the Mahari Hotel in Sirte, where at least 53 people were apparently executed . Scruffy: Another picture inside the ville where Gadaffi hid shows an untidy basement with mattresses scattered everywhere . Reduced to rubble: Inside the villa where Gadaffi hid, a wall is knocked through, while outside a nearby building remains battered with a burnt out car parked by its entrance . Most of them apparently fled District Two, the neighbourhood where Gaddafi was hiding, and some had bandaged wounds, suggesting they had been patients in Sirte’s hospital at some stage. In District Two, it is as if a hurricane of bullets and shrapnel has ripped through the town, tearing chunks out of buildings – and people. Bodies lie in the courtyards of homes and hundreds of thousands of spent rifle cartridges carpet every street. Even the trees are shredded. Sirte – the last Gaddafi stronghold to fall to the rebels – is an eerie ghost town, but a few residents have begun returning. They stare in disbelief at the ruins of their homes, many of which seem to have been looted by the rebels. Sewer capture: A picture shows the drainage sewer from which Gadaffi was dragged alive, before meeting his death soon after . Person effects: Used cups, including a Liverpool FC mug, are among the items found inside the villa where Gadaffi hid for two weeks . One resident fumed: ‘This war is not over yet. This war has only just begun.’ But others are in a state of shock rather than anger. Muftah Hassan, a 26-year-old engineer, said: ‘Not everyone here supported Gaddafi, and we had no choice that he came to hide here. ‘Our homes have been wiped out and our friends and family lie dead in the streets. There was no need for this.’ His friend Mohammed Bashir, 27, added: ‘Look at this place, at the bodies. It is an act of vengeance.’ Human Rights Watch’s emergencies director, Peter Bouckaert, last night urged the transitional authorities to ‘take action to rein in these groups’. n Gaddafi is expected to be buried today in an unmarked grave at a secret location, according to a rebel spokesman.","Growing concerns over possible war crimes by rebel fighters .

"A wartime codebreaker has revealed she and her co-workers at Bletchley Park dried their bras and knickers on Hitler's Enigma machine during night shifts at the cypher school. Elizabeth 'Betty' Balfour, 88, joined the Wrens when she was 17 and was handpicked to work on the top secret team under code genius Alan Turing. She said women at the chilly school would dry their damp underpants on the huge computers linked to the seized Enigma machine as they were the only source of heat at night. Her saucy secret comes days before the November 14 general release of the Imitation Game film, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing. Left, Elizabeth 'Betty' Balfour pictured as a 17-year-old when she started work codebreaking at Bletchley Park, and right, as a 88-year-old. She has now revealed some of the secrets on the Wrens . Mrs Balfour said: 'One thing I remember was that during night shifts the Enigma machine was the only warm thing about, so we used to wash our smalls and hang them around it to dry. 'It used to be festooned with bras and pants all through our night duty. Back then it must have looked a real sight.' Her father had to give his permission for her join the Wrens in 1944 because she was under 18. She spent six weeks training in London before being assigned to 'Special Duties X' and posted to the secret facility near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. She spent up to 10 hours a day sifting through reams of code and said they were never told where their work had actually succeeded. The women were even forbidden from talking to each other about their individuals parts of the puzzle. Here Mrs Balfour is pictured with a group of friends at Bletchley Park, where she and her fellow Wrens would laugh when they spotted Alan Turing walking across the grounds backwards while reading books . Mrs Balfour, pictured left and right in 1944 while she was based at Bletchley Park at a 17-year-old, signed up for the Wrens in the hope of finding adventure . Mrs Balfour said: 'We were given long strips of paper tape made by the Enigma machine and told to divide everything into fives. 'We used to get codes for the day, one I can remember is YO-SE-RO, a Japanese code for man. There were so many of them I can't remember, but I've always remembered that one. 'None of us knew everything that we were working on. We each knew a bit, our own part of the puzzle, so if you were caught, you couldn't tell them everything, even if they tortured you. 'We were told never to discuss with anyone else what we were doing. 'We never knew anything. We never knew what we had done, or if we had helped to actually crack the codes. 'I never even told my parents because we signed the Official Secrets Act, so they died without ever finding out what I was doing.' Mrs Balfour (pictured) said Alan Turing should be formally recognised for his code breaking work. Here she is pictured with awards she received thanking her for her service . Earlier this year Mrs Balfour returned to visit Bletchley Park as an 88-year-old (pictured). She spent 18 months at the grounds breaking codes during the Second World War . Mrs Balfour, from Helensburgh, Scotland, said she and her fellow Wrens would see Turing walking about the grounds - often backwards as he read a book. She said: 'We used to see Alan Turing from time to time, and back then we used to giggle and laugh. 'We used to watch him walk backwards sometimes while reading a book, and we couldn't help but giggle at him for how he acted. She explained they all though he was strange - but a genius. 'I feel the government should formally recognise him for his work during the war. He did so much and his name has not yet appeared anywhere really. It's too late for him now, but people should know what he did. 'He was pushed into the background, but all these people with these brilliant minds were a bit different in their own way.' Mathematical genius Alan Turing's invention helped save countless Allied lives . The Enigma was a machine developed by the Germans which enabled them to send official military and strategic communications in scrambled code. Using a complicated system of rotors, the machine would encode messages before sending them via Morse code to another machine. If the receiving machine had been programmed with the same settings - one of 158 million million million combinations - the message would be deciphered. However the team of cryptologists, linguists, scientists and data analysts at Bletchley, in Buckinghamshire, led by Londoner Turing, were able to break it. It was thwarted in part thanks to Alan Turing's 'Bombe' device, which was able to speed up the code-breaking process immeasurably. Turing based his invention on a Polish device, the 'Bomba', which was handed over to Britain just weeks before Poland was invaded in 1939. As Winston Churchill himself made clear, the accurate information which flowed from Bletchley Park every day, at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day, saved lives and gave Britain a crucial edge in battle.","Elizabeth 'Betty' Balfour said Bletchley Park was freezing cold at night .

"The owner of an Japanese Akita which attacked a three-year-old boy and left him needing 100 stitches has been told he will not have to destroy his dog. Trafford-James Jackson-Poole required surgery on his left cheek and suffered a fractured eye socket after the brutal mauling at a pub in Newbold near Chesterfield in 2012. Despite the horrifying incident, which left the boy with a permanent scar, Les Kirk-Kingstone, 63, was found not guilty of failing to control his dog after a hearing at Derby Crown Court. Owner: Les Kirk-Kingstone with his Japanese Akita, Tyber. He was found not guilty of failing to control his dog after an incident which left a three-year-old boy requiring 100 stitches . The three-year-old was with his mother, Gemma Jackson, 29 , and his father, engineer James Poole, 31, when he wandered into another room at the Nag’s Head pub and was bitten in the face by the Akita. Miss Jackson said: 'I heard a barking noise and then Trafford-James came in holding his face. The first thing I thought was ""is he going to die""? 'I was in complete shock. He has been quite lucky because it could have been so much worse. It’ s frightening to think what could have happened.' Scene: The attack occured at the Nag's Head in Newbold, Derbyshire, in December 2012 . Following the attack in December 2012, Mr Kirk-Kingstone gave up a job he had after 35 years in the trade. 'I . was absolutely devastated,' he said. 'I have lost three stones in . weight with worry. I would rather have gone to prison that have my dog . destroyed. 'Tyber was asleep . in a private room when the little boy wandered in. He jumped onto the . dog to play with him but he startled Tyber because he was asleep.' Before: A picture taken of the three-year-old boy before the horrific incident . After: The youngster suffered a fractured eye socket and has been left with a scar after he was mauled . Mr Kirk-Kingstone said his dog had . previously saved him from a vicious street attack after two men attacked . him and tried to snatch the pub’s takings. 'They . kicked me to the floor,' he said. 'Tyber was in the car and saw I was . in trouble. He jumped out of the window and the men ran off, he saved my . life. 'All the locals have supported me, none of them wanted Tyber destroyed, he’s just a big softie.' Miss Jackson, from Newbold, also mother to . Jordan, 12, would not comment on the outcome of the court case but . added: 'Trafford-James has been very quiet since it happened and not . really himself. Family: The youngster's mother, Gemma, was scared her son was 'going to die' in the aftermath of the mauling . He still has a scar, he won’t go near dogs now and is . scared when he hears them barking.' After . the attack, she told the Daily Mirror: 'He's usually a really smiley . boy but now when he smiles the left side of his smile turns down. 'Trafford keeps saying to me ""am I still cute, Mum?""' It . is against the law to let a dog be dangerously out of control in a . public or private place where the dog isn’t allowed to be, such as a . neighbour’s house or garden.

"Burka ban: A teenage French Muslim girl tried to commit suicide after two men attacked her for wearing a veil on August 12 (file photo) A teenage French Muslim girl, who was attacked by two men with a box cutter for wearing a veil, has tried to commit suicide. The 16-year-old is reportedly in a critical condition in hospital after jumping out a fourth storey window at her home in Trappes, Paris yesterday. While her motives for suicide remain unclear, she is believed to have also unsuccessfully tried to overdose on pills last week according to French newspaper Le Parisien. In July, hundreds of Muslim protesters clashed with riot police in the Parisian suburb after attempts were made to fine a woman for wearing a full Islamic veil. Since the controversial burka ban which was introduced across France in 2011 there has been a string of violent incidents across the country. Worried that the girl’s suicide attempt might spark more riots, police were stationed in the commuter town to the west of the French capital on Monday night but no disorder unfolded. The girl told police that on August . 12 she was approached by two ‘European looking’ men with shaved heads . near Square Berlioz as she left a friend’s house at 5.45pm. The . men allegedly shouted anti-Muslim and racist remarks at her before . wielding a box cutter. They ripped off her veil, pushed her over and hit . her. Riot rampage: The 16-year-old jumped out a fourth storey window in Trappes, Paris where in July hundreds of Muslim protesters clashed with riot police (pictured) after attempts were made to fine a woman for wearing a full Islamic veil . She told The Huffington Post: . ‘The first man started to touch my chest and then I managed to slap . him, but then he punched me in the chest. He then took out a sharp . object and started to cut my face with short, quick movements.’ Her . attackers fled in a car when another man intervened. Le Parisien . newspaper reported that she had ‘light scratch marks’ on her throat and . face. Police in Yveslines . are currently investigating the attack and looking at CCTV footage but . are struggling because no eye witnesses to the attack have come forward. It . is unclear whether the teenager was wearing a hijab (headscarf) or a . niqab (full face veil) which is now prohibited under the French burka . ban. Women found guilty of wearing veils which cover the face in public . can be fined the equivalent of £130 and be forced to attend citizenship . classes. Trappes riots: During the July riots hundreds of people surrounded the police headquarters in the area and bombarded officers with stones while also they started fires and vandalised property . At the time of the girl's attack, the French . Interior Minister Manuel Valls said: ‘I severely condemn this newest . demonstration of anti-Muslim hatred and intolerance.’ During . the riots in Trappes in July, hundreds of people surrounded the police . headquarters in the area and bombarded officers with stones while also . they started fires and vandalised property. A 14-year-old boy suffered a serious . eye injury in the violence, while four police were hurt on Saturday, . said local prosecutor Vincent Lesclous. A . police source in Trappes said: ‘The disturbances are related to the . arrest of a man who objected to his wife being controlled for wearing a . veil. ‘He attacked officers and was then arrested. It is this which led to the protests outside the police headquarters in Trappes.’ A 21-year-old pregnant woman was also attacked by suspected vigilantes for covering her face with a veil on the same council estate. In March, a Frenchman who ripped a Muslim woman's veil off her eyes was given a five-month suspended prison sentence. The 30-year-old said he was merely trying to 'enforce' his country's laws when he carried out the attack in the city of Nantes.

"Gun Manufacturers Smith & Wesson have unleashed their newest revolver: a monster .460 calibre handgun which they say is 'great for a back-up gun, or for hunting'. Named the 'Backpack Cannon', the gun was unveiled in Las Vegas on Monday at the Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade show, the largest gun show in the U.S., which around 60,000 gun fans attend every year. The cannon - officially called the Performance Center Model.460 - features a three-inch barrel, high visibility sights and synthetic shock absorber on the rear of the handle, as well as a massive chamber to fit the gigantic .460 calibre rounds, which are some of the biggest and most powerful bullets in the world. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The massive handgun can also carry two other types of ammunition as well as the super powerful .460 caliber bullets . The 5-round chambers are big enough to put your finger into comfortably, which gives an indication as to how big the rounds are . Paul Pluff, who works for Smith & Wesson told Military.com: 'It's a very comfortable gun to shoot. It's great for a back-up gun in the back-country, or even for hunting if . you’re going after some pigs or hogs or anything like that.' Experienced hunters warn that pigs can get aggressive when 'up close and personal' and a large bullet is needed to make sure they are dispatched effectively. Some outdoorsmen also feel the need to handicap themselves and hunt with pistols as technology makes long range rifles increasingly accurate and easy to fire. Smith & Wesson acknowledges that revolvers have been replaced by high-capacity semi-automatic pistols such as the Glock series when it comes to self defense, often taking the place of 'second-choice' among potential gun owners. However large caliber still have a dedicated following, with models such as the .500 Magnum - which fires an even larger bullet than the backpack cannon - being the most popular example. But while they may be toted by action film heroes, the reality is that large caliber weapons such as the .460 revolver are largely confined to target shooting. Smith & Wesson says they think that their new revolver will make a nice companion for those that enjoy outdoor activities. The company suggests that avid outdoorsmen could carry the gun in their backpack in case their main armament fails. And the huge caliber of the revolver means it could also be used to fend off bears. The Backpack Cannon comes with a shock absorbing handle, making it easier to fire repeatedly . High visibility sights on the top of the handgun allow for better accuracy when targeting smaller objects . The pistol packs a huge punch, and you'll need strong fingers to pull back the massive trigger . The firearm's 3-inch chambers hold five massive rounds, including the one pictured here . In addition to the plethora of . attachments that aid targeting and shooting, the gun is also compatible . with several forms of ammo, able to carry .454 Casull rounds and . .45 Long Colt ammo, both of which pack a significant punch. Military.com gave a favorable review to the handgun, saying 'there is still a place for weapons like this especially if you like camping where the critters are big enough to eat you.' At $1,200 (£730) the gun is much more expensive than your average handgun. Powerful: The revolver gave a powerful kickback when tested by enthusiats . Clint Eastwood in the 1973 film 'Dirty Harry', brandishing his infamous Smith & Wesson .375 calibre hand gun . Smith & Wesson was founded in 1852 in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson. The company was the first to create the 'lever action pistol' which meant that a shooter would not have to pull the hammer back to fire one shot after the other. Their handguns quickly became standard issue with law enforcement in the Old West, with famous U.S. lawman Wyatt Earp adopting a Smith & Wesson 'Russian Model' as his primary firearm. This tradition of law enforcement, including military and police, using Smith & Wesson pistols as their main handgun continues today. Smith & Wesson was notably made famous in popular culture by the use of the Magnum Revolver by Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies, with one of the film's even producing a monologue about the gun itself.","Backpack cannon is for 'when critters are big enough to eat you'

"When Jennifer Devitt discovered she was pregnant with her second child in quick succession, she decided to take a preventative strike on her mummy tummy. ‘I’m a size eight and have always had a flat stomach, but when I had my first daughter I found it really difficult to get it back,’ says  Jennifer, 29, a beauty therapist and mother to Indie-May, 20 months, and Holly, four months. ‘My muscles were non-existent, everything stuck out and it was six months before I could wear a T-shirt because of my jelly belly. I felt really self-conscious and didn’t even like looking in the mirror. ‘I knew that with your second baby everything can really go haywire because your muscles are already weakened, so I started looking for something to help.’ The big squeeze: Anna and her corset . To most women, that might be a gym membership, a sharp swerve away from the biscuit aisle in the supermarket or a brisk walk with the buggy each day. But, like a growing number of mothers, Jennifer wanted results more quickly than that. Shopping in Mothercare, she chanced upon what she saw as a solution to her problems — a Belly Bandit. This is a huge band of thick, strong elastic that’s worn around the midriff after pregnancy and promises to shrink the belly, waist and hips. It is also said to remind women to tighten their core muscles, to reduce swelling and stretch marks, and support the spine. Similar compression garments are called The Cinch, the Squeem and the Gowri wrap. The trend is huge in the U.S. and is becoming popular here, despite warnings that it can be damaging to women’s health. Jennifer strapped herself into the Belly Bandit just three days after giving birth. ‘I wore it day and night — I was pretty determined. And it was so expensive, around £70, that I wanted to get my money’s worth,’ she says. ‘I found it comfortable and even slept in it. My partner, Wesley, didn’t mind it.  He knew I wanted to feel good in my clothes.’ Jennifer, who lives in the Home Counties, says she was ‘gobsmacked’ at  the results. ‘Within two weeks I was a size ten and could wear a tight T-shirt. I really noticed the difference in my abdominal and pelvic-floor floor muscles, even though I wasn’t doing any exercise. ‘It took me six weeks to get back to a size eight and a weight of eight stone. I never thought it would be so dramatic.’ Anna shows off her unbelievably tiny waist which she achieved by wearing her compression girdle. Initially worn to support her back after having a Caesarean, Anna still wears it if she wants to wear a certain dress to help cinch in her waist and yummy . Belly-binding is rooted in ancient tradition. In Japan, the Middle East and South America, it is normal for women to wear a compressing wrap, corset or girdle to speed up their return to their pre-pregnancy size. Its revival in the West has been fuelled by celebrity endorsements: the actress Jessica Alba credited her enviably tiny and toned post-baby body to wearing two corsets, one on top of the other, day and night, for three months. Kourtney Kardashian and Minnie Driver sang the praises of the Belly Bandit while Angelina Jolie and Gwen Stefani wore The Cinch, a £75 wrap available in upmarket maternity shops. While there’s no doubt shapewear can make lumps and bumps appear to vanish, some experts warn against squeezing your post- pregnancy body back into shape. Some obstetricians in the U.S. say women are risking stress incontinence, digestion problems and weakened back muscles. Nicky Croft, a women’s health physiotherapist at the APPI Clinic in Hampstead, North London, says: ‘After giving birth, the uterus is still enlarged and the whole of the abdominal wall has lengthened and stretched throughout the pregnancy. ‘This will return to normal, but it takes time. The evidence shows that the best way to reduce abdominal distension is breast-feeding and specific exercises to strengthen the abdominals during and after pregnancy. ‘A belly-binder won’t help you lose baby fat — the only things to affect that are your metabolism and diet. If you bind the abdominal wall too tightly, you’re putting your pelvic floor under pressure, which could lead to urinary leakage. The pelvic floor has just been through a big stretch, so the last thing it wants is to be pressured.’ Gwen Stefani wore The Cinch which is a £75 wrap sold in upmarket maternity stores to help her return to her pre-baby shape after she had given birth . The other concern is that belly binders take over the job of the tummy muscles, meaning deeper, core muscles become lazy. ‘If you give too much external support to the stomach, the abdominal and pelvic-floor muscles will be deterred from working as well,’ says Croft. ‘So, in the long term you might become reliant on wearing the wrap to keep yourself supported, rather than retraining your core muscles to do it.’ Kathryn Lister tried two belly binders  following the birth of her daughter Daisy. ‘As I’m 41, I was aware my body could go south after I had a baby,’  says Kathryn, who works in  finance and is married to Simon, 45. ‘The rest of me is fairly flabby, but my stomach has always been flat. So I really wanted to try to hold on to it. I was reading online mothers’ forums and saw all these mentions of belly binding. ‘I remember reading about Jessica Alba doing it and that really stuck in my mind. I ended up buying The Cinch and some Squeem shapewear.’ Two days after her daughter was born, Kathryn strapped herself into The Cinch, but struggled to get used to it. ‘Daisy was born on one of the hottest days of the year, so it was uncomfortable. It was also very obvious. If I was wearing anything other than a thick shirt or jumper you could see it under my clothes. ‘It’s recommended to wear it for 18 hours a day, which seemed like madness. ‘In the end, I had to take it off every time I wanted to feed Daisy because I simply wasn’t comfortable sitting in it.’ After two weeks, Kathryn decided to try the Squeem, a girdle that runs from under the bra to the bikini line. ‘This was even worse. It had hook and eye fastenings, so it took ages to put on and bits of you spill out. The fat has got to go somewhere, hasn’t it? I looked like an overstuffed sausage.’ Yet the internet is awash with ‘miracle’ stories about women racing to get back into their pre-pregnancy clothes. Mother-of-two Anna Blakey wore a compression girdle after her two pregnancies. Angelina Jolie, pictured left, wore The Cinch to help return to her famously beautiful body shape while Minnie Driver, pictured right with her son, Henry, wore another brand called the Belly Bandit . ‘I’m a small build, so I didn’t put on much weight, but my muscles were weak and I was looking for something to support my back,’ says Anna, 40, a graphic designer who lives with her husband Dominic, 45, a sales director, and their children in South London. ‘I loved the feeling of support and confidence it gave me and people were amazed when I was back in my size-ten jeans within two weeks of giving birth.’ When Anna had her son, now three, she had to have an emergency Caesarean. Without discussing it with her midwife, she used a girdle designed for  post C-section bellies, with side-fastening eyehooks. ‘It sat smoothly over the scar and made all my clothes more comfortable. I think it also helped the scar to heal, in the same way that if you cut your finger you put pressure on it,’ she says. Anna still occasionally wears her compression garment. ‘I will put it on if I want to wear a certain dress. It helps cinch in my waist and tum.’ At 13 inches, Ethel Granger’s waist was the smallest ever recorded. She appeared on the  cover of Italian  Vogue . However, despite such reports, the belly-binding trend worries midwives, who feel women are under too much pressure to snap back into shape after pregnancy. Janet Fyle, who leads the Royal College Of Midwives’ policy on obesity and maternal public health issues, says: ‘It is far better to lose your pregnancy weight gradually, by eating healthily and taking gentle exercise, such as swimming, with your baby. ‘Women who are pregnant or who have just given birth should be celebrated, not hidden away. We’re at risk of making women feel guilty about their bodies.’ Kathryn, who had suffered an abdominal split  — where the muscles do not reconnect properly after birth — ditched the two different belly binders and saw a physiotherapist. ‘She gave me some Pilates and pelvic-floor exercises, which are helping. I just don’t think there’s a quick fix,’ she says. And like many new mothers, Kathryn found that the arrival of her little girl signalled a change in her priorities. ‘I haven’t worried about my stomach as much as I thought I would,’ she says. ‘Daisy is my focus. All I cared about was being able to feed her, to cuddle her and feel her skin on mine. Yes, my tummy is probably a bit squishy, but it’s all worth it for her.’","The Belly Bandit .

"Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to play in the Champions League next season. The rules now effectively set up a scenario where rivals can claim City have cheated their way to passing UEFA’s ‘Financial Fair Play’ (FFP) test. It is understood lawyers for a host of ‘major clubs’ are aware of these potential rights to make appeals — thanks to recently amended Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations — and are monitoring the situation closely. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho question the fairness of FFP . Expensive squad: But could Manchester City's big-spending ways cost them a Champions League place? On Saturday night Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who faces City on Monday in the game of the season so far, accused some unnamed clubs of ‘dodgy FFP’. He said: ‘There are clubs that are following exactly the project of Financial Fair Play and there are other clubs doing it in a dodgy way. For me, that is very clear. I don’t say the clubs — that is not my job.’ When asked specifically about City, and a potential UEFA investigation, he added: ‘It’s for Mr Platini and other people to analyse it, it’s not for me… I’m waiting for that.’ Financial force: Manchester City's spending power is among the greatest in football . 'Dodgy FFP'? Jose Mourinho was critical, but he manages another expensive squad at Chelsea . Concern? Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has a proven track record in the Champions League . FFP rules compel clubs to limit losses for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons combined to £37million, with a ban from European competitions the severest theoretical punishment. City last week announced losses for 2012-13 of £51.6m, meaning they have lost £149.5m over two years. They can perhaps ‘exempt’ as much as £110m of those losses to meet FFP requirements. But they face accusations their losses are artificially low after earning cash from ‘intellectual property’ sales to related companies. UEFA sources have confirmed this will be investigated to see if it is ‘real’ income. Amended small print in the 2014 UEFA FFP rulebook, just published, includes two key changes; one allowing clubs to ‘plea bargain’ punishments for overspending, and another that allows other clubs to challenge those plea bargains if they feel the outcomes negatively affect them. Time to celebrate? Liverpool are one of the clubs not in a position to compete with City's financial muscle .

"Facing bankruptcy, the U.S. Postal Service is pushing ahead with unprecedented cuts to first-class mail next spring that will slow delivery and, for the first time in 40 years, eliminate the chance for stamped letters to arrive the next day. The estimated $3billion in reductions, to be announced in broader detail on Monday, are part of a wide-ranging effort by the cash-strapped Postal Service to quickly trim costs, seeing no immediate help from Congress. The changes would provide short-term relief, but ultimately could prove counterproductive, pushing more of America's business onto the Internet. Save our post: Nearly 100,000 postal workers could lose their jobs in an unprecedented budget cut that would also halt next-day mail . They could slow everything from check payments to Netflix's DVDs-by-mail, add costs to mail-order prescription drugs, and threaten the existence of newspapers and time-sensitive magazines delivered by postal carrier to far-flung suburban and rural communities. That birthday card mailed first-class to Mom also could arrive a day or two late, if people don't plan ahead. 'It's a potentially major change, but I don't think consumers are focused on it and it won't register until the service goes away,' said Jim Corridore, analyst with S&P Capital IQ, who tracks the shipping industry. 'Over time, to the extent the customer service experience gets worse, it will only increase the shift away from mail to alternatives.' The cuts, now being finalized, would close roughly 250 of the nearly 500 mail processing centres across the country as early as next March. Because the consolidations typically would lengthen the distance mail travels from post office to processing centre, the agency also would lower delivery standards for first-class mail that have been in place since 1971. Currently, first-class mail is supposed to be delivered to homes and businesses within the continental U.S. in one day to three days. That will lengthen to two days to three days, meaning mailers no longer could expect next-day delivery in surrounding communities. Periodicals could take between two days and nine days. Deliver the letter: First-class mail will experience the downgrade as early as March in certain areas . About 42 per cent of first-class mail is now delivered the following day. An additional 27 per cent arrives in two days, about 31 per cent in three days and less than 1 per cent in four days to five days. Following the change next spring, about . 51 per cent of all first-class mail is expected to arrive in two days, . with most of the remainder delivered in three days. 'The things I have control over here at . the Postal Service, we have to do. If we do nothing, we will have a death . spiral.' -Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe . The consolidation of mail processing centres is in addition to the planned closing of about 3,700 local post offices. In all, roughly 100,000 postal employees could be cut as a result of the various closures, resulting in savings of up to $6.5billion a year. Expressing urgency to reduce costs, Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said in an interview that the agency has to act while waiting for Congress to grant it authority to reduce delivery to five days a week, raise stamp prices and reduce health care and other labour costs. The Postal Service, an independent agency of government, does not receive tax money, but is subject to congressional control on large aspects of its operations. The changes in first-class mail delivery can go into place without permission from Congress. Better late than never: Time-sensitive materials like mailers and prescription drugs would take two to nine days to deliver if the new plan takes effect . After five years in the red, the post office faces imminent default this month on a $5.5billion annual payment to the Treasury for retiree health benefits. It is projected to have a record loss of $14.1billion next year amid steady declines in first-class mail volume. Mr Donahoe has said the agency must make cuts of $20 billion by 2015 to be profitable. It already has announced a 1-cent increase in first-class mail to 45 cents beginning January 22. 'We have a business model that is failing. You can't continue to run red ink and not make changes,' Mr Donahoe said. 'We know our business, and we listen to our customers. Customers are looking for affordable and consistent mail service, and they do not want us to take tax money.' Separate bills that have passed House and Senate committees would give the Postal Service more authority and liquidity to stave off immediate bankruptcy. But prospects are somewhat dim for final congressional action on those bills anytime soon, especially if the measures are seen in an election year as promoting layoffs and cuts to neighbourhood post offices. Industries hurt: Netflix, which delivers movies to some of its customers, could potentially suffer from the lag in mail delivery . Technically, the Postal Service must await an advisory opinion from the independent Postal Regulatory Commission before it can begin closing local post offices and processing centres. But such opinions are nonbinding, and Mr Donahoe is making clear the agency will proceed with reductions once the opinion is released next March. 'The things I have control over here at the Postal Service, we have to do,' he said, describing the cuts as a necessary business decision. 'If we do nothing, we will have a death spiral.' The Postal Service initially announced in September it was studying the possibility of closing the processing centres and published a notice in the Federal Register seeking comments. Within 30 days, the plan elicited nearly 4,400 public comments, mostly in opposition. Among them: . Maine Senator Susan Collins, the top Republican on the Senate committee that oversees the post office, believes the agency is taking the wrong approach. She says service cuts will only push more consumers to online bill payment or private carriers such as UPS or FedEx, leading to lower revenue in the future. 'Time and time again in the face of more red ink, the Postal Service puts forward ideas that could well accelerate its death spiral,' she said, urging passage of a bill that would refund nearly $7billion the Postal Service overpaid into a federal retirement fund, encourage a restructuring of health benefits and reduce the agency's annual payments into a retiree health account. That measure would postpone a move to five-day-a-week mail delivery for at least two years and require additional layers of review before the agency closed postal branches and mail processing centres. 'The solution to the Postal Service's financial crisis is not easy but must involve tackling more significant expenses that do not drive customers,' Miss Collins said. In the event of a shutdown due to bankruptcy, private companies such as FedEx and UPS could handle a small portion of the material the post office moves, but they do not go everywhere. No business has shown interest in delivering letters everywhere in the country for a set rate of 44 cents or 45 cents for a first-class letter.","Post office set to close 250 of nearly 500 mail processing centres as early as March .

Small-town mayors and legislators in states including Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania cited the economic harm if postal offices were to close, eliminating jobs and reducing service. Small-business owners in many other states also were worried.
ESPN The Magazine and Crain Communications, which prints some 27 trade and consumer publications, said delays to first-class delivery could ruin the value of their news. Their magazines are typically printed at week's end with mail arrival timed for weekend sports events or the Monday start of the work week. Newspapers, already struggling in the Internet age, also could suffer.
AT&T, which mails approximately 55million customer billing statements each month, wants assurances that the Postal Service will widely publicize and educate the public about changes to avoid confusion over delivery that might lead to delinquent payments. The company is also concerned that after extensive cuts the Postal Service might realize it cannot meet a relaxed standard of two-to-three day delivery.
Netflix, which offers monthly pricing plans for unlimited DVDs by mail, sent one disc or two at a time. Longer delivery times would mean fewer opportunities to receive discs each month, effectively a price increase. Netflix in recent months has been vigorously promoting its video streaming service as an alternative."

"Banks are revolutionizing the way you withdraw money.  Instead of using a traditional debit or credit card at an ATM, you will be able to log into a banking app on your cell phone and order cash up to 24 hours before a transaction. Financial Services giant FIS announced the innovative mobile banking technology at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas this week.  Three banks have already begun testing the app and hope to launch the services in their ATMs by the end of 2014. The three participating banks thus far are Wintrust in Illinois, BMO Harris in Chicago, and City National in Los Angeles. FIS announced this week that they have been gaining attention from a number of other large banks as well as smaller institutions about the mobile banking app. Mary Monahan, of Javelin Strategy & Research, believes that using a cell phone to make cash withdrawals is much safer than using a debit card. By the end of 2014, you will be able to use your cell phone as a debit card at participating banks . A receipt will be automatically saved on your phone making it easier to keep track of your transactions . Not only is it safer, it’s faster. The FIS mobile technology only takes approximately nine seconds to make a transaction. Using a traditional bank card can take up to 40 seconds. To use the app, simply open it on your cell phone when you are at a participating ATM.  Your phone will display a code which you then scan on the ATM screen. The machine then immediately dispenses the money. According to Monahan, cell phone transactions are safer than debit card ones because they protect card holders from fraudsters seeking to catch images of a card and pin number on camera. The quick transaction time and the privacy of the phone code make it more difficult for others to steal your identity. In order to use the ATM you will need to scan a personalized code on to the screen . Even if your phone is stolen, hackers would need to know your security code, banking information, and pin number in order to proceed with a withdrawal. The mobile technology is expanding beyond ATMs. Some restaurants plan to create apps that allow patrons to pay the bill with a cell phone. ‘The phone is becoming a security blanket,’ said Monahan. ‘The more you can do with it, the better.’One possible issue with the mobile app is phone connectivity. No cell phone service means no ATM cash withdrawal. No ATM withdrawal means no customers. To overcome the service issue, FIS said it is working on an ‘offline mode’ that would allow for transactions even without cell reception. Not only is technology becoming more advanced, it's becoming more human.  Bank of America, Chase, and other financial institutions have been experimenting with virtual tellers, ATMs that provide almost all the same services as a human teller would -- including exact change, video conferencing and loan and credit card payment capabilities.","Using your phone to make an ATM withdrawal is faster than using a debit card .

"The Indian mother who gave birth to conjoined twins last week has yet to meet her babies - because she is still coming to terms with what has happened. The twins, who were born last week with one body and two heads, have been moved to one of India’s top hospitals for further examination. Dr Shikha Malik, who delivered the . babies and is helping the family, said they have two heads, two . necks, two spines and two separate oesophaguses and trachea - but they . have only one heart and stomach and one lung each. Scroll down for video . The twins, born last week, each have a head, neck, spine and oesophagus. But they share a heart and stomach and have only one lung each . The twins were born last week in northern India via C-section, weighing 7lbs 7oz . She . added that most of their vital organs are shared. And while one baby is . sleeping, one is crying - and the one on the right hand side of the body is so far growing much stronger. The twins are now being treated at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, in Delhi. But the parents, Urmila and Subhash Sharma, are still recovering at Cygnus JK Hindu Hospital in Sonipat, northern India, and are slowly coming to terms with the birth of such remarkable babies. Dr Malik said: ‘So far they are doing remarkably well. It is a gift that they have come this far. 'We can only pray that there is a future for them. We are trying all we can to help them and we’re speaking to experts from all over the world to see if there’s any chance of surgery. But it is looking unlikely at the moment.’ The babies’ father, Subhash, 32, who . works as a labourer in a bicycle factory, said he is pinning all his . hopes on the doctors but his priority is the health of his wife . The twins' parents, Urmila and Subhash Sharma, are still coming to terms with the birth of such remarkable babies. It has been reported the mother has yet to see the twins . Doctors say that most of the babies' vital organs are shared. And while one baby is sleeping, one is crying. The baby on the right side of the body is also growing faster . ‘When my wife started to feel pain in her stomach we rushed to see a doctor. When we came to know about them there were no words, there was no way out, we were very shocked. It was all in god’s hands,’ he said. ‘I’m their father so I’ll do whatever I can for them. Whatever I’m earning will go towards my children.' Just as I’ve cared for my daughter I will care for these babies too but the future will depend on the doctors. I’m a poor man and I will do my best for my family. Right now I am also worried about my wife. I can only hope the doctors will be able to help us.’ Urmila, 28, has only seen a photo of her conjoined babies and is yet to meet them. Her husband and three-year-old daughter Shalini are with her throughout the day as she regains her strength. The babies have now been moved to one of India's top hospitals to see if separating them is possible . Dr Malik said: ‘She is feeling mentally drained and doesn’t feel strong enough to see her babies yet. 'Her husband will tell us when she’s ready. We can only imagine what she must be feeling, it’s a very sad case.’ Dr Malik said last week: ‘The parents are very distressed and we are helping the family the best we can.' The babies, who together weighed 7lb 7oz when they were born, will remain at AIIMS and be closely monitored. Dr Malik said: 'So far they are doing remarkably well. It is a gift that they have come this far' Dr Minu Bajpai, paediatric surgeon in . charge of the babies while at AIIMS, said: ‘We’re in the process of . working out their anatomy and the extent of their fusion. 'Their . respiratory elements are infected right now so we’re trying to treat . that and we need them to stablise before we can move forward. ‘We will be doing further tests next week. This is a very rare case, it’s very complex but we’re hoping further testing will tell us more of the right way forward.’ Urmila and Subhash, who have one other daughter, were too poor to have an ultrasound during the pregnancy so complications had gone unnoticed. Fears: The baby's mother gave birth to conjoined twins in Haryana, northern India, last week and doctors initially feared their chances of survival were slim . Dr Malik added: ‘We only came to know . she was carrying conjoined twins after an ultrasound two weeks ago but . it was too late to do anything by then.

"In the future astronauts on missions to distant worlds like Mars will print some of the tools they need and, maybe one day, even their food. Now an important first step to realising that dream has  been achieved, as Nasa has made the first 3D-printed object in space. Using a printer installed on the ISS earlier this month, the crew created a calibration object and will eventually use it to make useful items. Scroll down for video explanation . Astronauts on the ISS have printed the first 3D object in space (shown). They used a printer built by California-based company Made in Space. It was taken to the ISS in September by SpaceX's Dragon capsule. The demonstration is an important step to having 'replicators' on future missions . The device was created by California-based company Made in Space, who were contracted by Nasa to design it for the ISS. Called the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration, it aims to show the 'additive manufacturing' technique can make 3D printed parts and tools in space. The first object that has now been printed was a faceplate engraved with the names of Nasa and Made in Space written on it. 3D printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file. They work in an extremely simple way, by building up a 3D object from layers of material. Like a traditional inkjet printer, material, usually plastic, is laid down on a base. Further layers are simply printed on top, gradually revealing a 3D object. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Many believe it could even lead to 'mini factories' for living rooms . allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a . replacement part for a broken household appliance. The printer was installed on the station by astronaut Butch Wilmore, in the station's Microgravity Science Glovebox, which is used for conducting science and technology experiments. The printer used plastic to form the first of a series of calibration coupons. It works by heating a relatively low-temperature plastic filament to build parts layer by later in designs supplied to the machine. The printer left Earth in September 2014 on SpaceX's fourth commercial resupply mission. About 20 objects will be printed in the next few weeks, and early next year they will be brought back to Earth by the Dragon capsule for analysis. Nasa will study the objects to see how zero-gravity conditions affect the printing process, although from these early tests there seems to be few inhibitions, if any. 'When the first human fashioned a tool from a rock, it couldn't have been conceived that one day we'd be replicating the same fundamental idea in space,' Aaron Kemmer, CEO of Made in Space, said in a statement. The printer was installed on the station by astronaut Butch Wilmore, in the station's Microgravity Science Glovebox (shown), which is used for conducting science and technology experiments.

Called the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration, it aims to show the 'additive manufacturing' technique can make 3D printed parts and tools in space. According to the company, the presence of a 3D printer on the ISS will allow hardware designs to be made on Earth and then digitally beamed to the space station. Physical objects can then be made in a matter of hours. 'This printer is a critical first step for in-space manufacturing,' said Jason Crusan, director of Nasa's Advanced Exploration Systems Division at Nasa Headquarters in Washington. 'Additive manufacturing with 3-D printers will allow space crews to be less reliant on supply missions from Earth and lead to sustainable, self-reliant exploration missions where resupply is difficult and costly. 'The space station provides the optimal place to perfect this technology in microgravity.' And Niki Wekheiser, Nasa's 3D printer project manager, added: 'The goal of the first phase of printing is to verify that the 3-D printing process works the same in microgravity as it does on the ground. 'Once we confirm that the process works, we will move to the second phase of printing which focuses more on the design and utilisation of the parts we print, which will ultimately lead to establishing an on-demand machine shop in space.'","Astronauts on the ISS have printed the first 3D object in space .

"Fashionable anti-cancer superfoods and supplements do not prevent the disease and may even cause it, according to a scientist who helped discover the structure of DNA. James Watson said the cure for many cancers will remain elusive unless scientists rethink the role of antioxidants, which include vitamin pills and food such as blueberries and broccoli. It is widely believed they boost health and fight cancer by mopping up oxygen molecules called free radicals. But Dr Watson argues these may be key to preventing and treating cancer – and depleting the body of them may be counter-productive. Counter productive? It is widely believed foods such as blueberries, left, and broccoli, right, help boost health and fight cancer by mopping up oxygen molecules called free radicals . Free radicals not only help keep diseased cells under control, they are also pivotal in making many cancer drugs, as well as radiotherapy, effective, he believes. Writing in a journal published by the Royal Society, the 84-year-old Nobel laureate stated that antioxidants ‘may have caused more cancers than they have prevented’. ‘For as long as I have been focused on the curing of cancer, well-intentioned individuals have been consuming antioxidative nutritional supplements as cancer preventatives, if not actual therapies,’ he said. ‘In light of recent data strongly hinting that much of late-stage cancer’s untreatability may arise from its possession of too many antioxidants, the time has come to seriously ask whether antioxidant use much more likely causes than prevents cancer.’ He said a vast number of studies had found antioxidants including vitamins A, C and E and the mineral selenium, to have ‘no obvious effectiveness’ in preventing stomach cancer or in lengthening life. Instead, they seem to slightly shorten the lives of those who take them, and vitamin E may be particularly dangerous. The American, who describes his theory as among his most important work since the DNA breakthrough with British colleague Francis Crick in 1953, said blueberries may taste good but give no protection against cancer. The study by Dr Watson,  based at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, is published in the journal Open Biology. He has caused uproar in the past with his opinions on race, intelligence, beauty and homosexuality. Professor Nic Jones, of Cancer Research UK, agreed that studies showed antioxidants were ineffective for cancer prevention in healthy people and can even slightly increase the risk of the disease. He said vitamins and minerals should be obtained through a healthy and balanced diet.","It is widely believed that superfoods like blueberries and broccoli help fight cancer by defending against oxygen molecules called free radicals .

"Tony Blair’s Downing Street was accused of trying to ‘pervert the course of justice’ yesterday after it emerged it had contacted the police – at the request of Gerry Adams – to demand the release of an  IRA gunman. An inquiry by MPs heard explosive new evidence from an ex-senior police officer linking the former Prime Minister to the controversial amnesty granted to on-the-run IRA suspects. It is the first time the Blair administration has been accused of direct interference on behalf of Sinn Fein  to secure the freedom of IRA  terror suspects. A former senior Ulster policeman says Blair's government tried to have a suspected gunman released from jail after Gerry Adams (left) put pressure on Downing Street . Norman Baxter, former Detective Chief Spt of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said he had arrested two men in March 2007 in relation to the shooting of a soldier. He said that, within hours, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams had contacted No 10 to request the release of Gerry McGeough, 55, and Vincent McAnespie, 51. Mr Baxter claimed: ‘Downing Street rang the chief constable’s office looking for their release. I got a call suggesting I should release them. 'That in my mind is perverting the course of justice. That, as a police officer, is totally illegal and unconstitutional’. Mr Baxter refused the request and, four years later, McGeough was convicted of the attempted murder in 1981 of part-time Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier Sammy Brush. Mr McAnespie was acquitted of helping with the attack. The Westminster committee is probing the case of John Downey, who was accused of the 1982 IRA murder of four soldiers in the Hyde Park bombing. To widespread fury, the charges against Mr Downey were dropped earlier this year after it emerged he had been mistakenly sent a letter by the Northern Ireland Office saying he was not wanted in Britain for any criminal offences. Ministers had sought to lay the blame on the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which supposedly supplied the information that Mr Downey was not wanted by the Met. But Mr Baxter categorically denied this was the case and accused the current Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, of ‘disgracefully’ trying to shift the blame away from the politicians and on to police. In evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Mr Baxter claimed there was ‘a culture within the Northern Ireland Office to ensure that republicans were not prosecuted’. Around 200 on-the-run terror suspects were granted an effective amnesty following the 1998 Good Friday Agreement negotiated by Mr Blair. The then Prime Minister was under pressure from Sinn Fein to grant them amnesty to secure the peace. Former PSNI assistant chief constable Peter Sheridan also gave evidence to the committee. He said the professionals at the NIO knew where the line constituting political interference was and did not cross it, as far as he was aware. He also insisted police acted properly. An independent review of the Downey case has been ordered by David Cameron.","In 2007 two suspected gunmen were arrested by Royal Ulster Constabulary .

"Top gambler: Multi-millionaire Mr Ivey, 36, has been dubbed ¿the Tiger Woods of poker¿ . One of the world’s top gamblers won £7.8 million in a game of chance by ‘reading’ the backs of the cards, claim the owners of Britain’s oldest casino, who are refusing to pay out. Phil Ivey, dubbed ‘the Tiger Woods of poker’, is understood to have exploited tiny flaws in the card design during a game of punto banco, a type of baccarat based purely on luck. He insists he did nothing illegal, however, and is suing Mayfair club Crockfords in the High Court in what is expected to be the biggest legal battle in casino history. The technique has echoes of Kaleidoscope, a 1966 film starring Warren Beatty as a playboy who breaks into a card manufacturer to mark the cards and then beat the bank at every European casino. The Mail on Sunday, which revealed last October that Mr Ivey’s winnings had been withheld, understands the cards were flawed because of a mistake during the cutting process at an overseas manufacturing plant. Crucially, it meant their geometric pattern was not symmetrical, though this would not have been noticeable to the untrained eye. Cards should look exactly the same if turned 180 degrees. If they do not, it allows so-called advantage players to use a system known as ‘playing the turn’. Multi-millionaire Mr Ivey, 36, was accompanied by an unidentified Chinese woman and was the only person playing against the croupier over three nights at the exclusive Mayfair club last August. His remarkable winning streak was witnessed by a casino inspector and ten video cameras.Initially gambling £50,000 per hand, which can be over in less than a minute, he was later given permission by the management to increase his stake to £150,000. It is thought his companion, who is banned from at least two casinos around the world, was also able to spot the imperfections and helped Mr Ivey place his bets. Like Mr Ivey, she lives in Las Vegas. Along with two others, she is said to have won more than $1 million in similar fashion in the US in 2011, but the money was similarly withheld and the casino’s decision was later upheld by a gaming commission. It is not clear if Mr Ivey and the woman heard about the rogue cards at Crockfords before arranging the punto banco game or simply noticed them while playing. Punto banco is the sister game of chemin de fer, the high-stakes card game favoured by James Bond. The aim is to hold cards with a count of nine or closest to nine. You bet that either the hand held by the player (punto) or banker/croupier (banco) will win and place bets on the appropriate area on the table. Tens and picture cards and multiples of ten count as zero. Though Mr Ivey was not allowed to touch the cards at any point, he is thought to have instructed the dealer to tilt each card back to expose its value. Break the bank: Warren Beatty in Kaleidoscope about a marked-card scam . The key cards he was looking out for were nines and eights, and possibly sevens and sixes. When these cards appeared, his companion asked for them to be rotated 180 degrees, pretending that Mr Ivey was superstitious. As this appeared to give him no advantage, the dealer acquiesced. The rotated cards were returned to the shoe and were easily recognised by the player as different when they were eventually re-dealt, giving him a strong edge. At first, his losses were heading towards £500,000 but he recovered, and at the end of the first night was £2.3 million up. He is also thought to have persuaded the casino not to destroy the cards at the end of each session, which is normal practice. By ‘holding the shoe’ his rotated cards were preserved for the following day’s play. The 184-year-old casino, the oldest private gaming club in the world, initially agreed to transfer his winnings to his bank account, but nine months on it has returned only his £1 million stake. Crockfords is owned by Genting, a Malaysian gaming corporation, which sent investigators to London to question employees and scrutinise hours of CCTV footage. Willy Allison, a leading casino suveillance specialist, warned the gaming industry about flawed cards in November 2011. He described their exploitation as the ‘latest scam to hit Las Vegas casinos’, adding: ‘Not every player who wins a lot of money at the casino is a cheat. You don’t have to be. Legal battle: Crockfords casino in Mayfair is being sued by Phil Ivey after he played there for three nights last August . ‘By turning an asymmetrical card 180 degrees it is possible to identify what the value of the card is before it is revealed. You simply glance at the edges on the back of the card. ‘Essentially, playing the turn has the same effect as marking the cards and gives players a huge house edge. ‘Who needs invisible ink and red-tinted sunglasses when you’ve got manufacturer-made “marked cards”.’ Mr Allison said casino card manufacturers are under pressure to produce more and more cards, mainly due to massive demand in Macau where millions are used — and destroyed at the end of each session — every day. ‘Inevitably quality control goes down because of this,’ he said last night. ‘Casino management should be vigilant when it comes to manufacturer defects and flaws.’ Mr Ivey said: ‘I was given a receipt for my winnings but Crockfords has withheld payment. I have no alternative but to take legal action.’ A spokesman for Crockfords said: ‘We shall be defending this claim vigorously.’","Phil Ivey is accused of 'reading' the cards in a game based purely on luck .

"Campaign: On some days, Brenda Leyland, pictured, would send 50 messages attacking the McCanns . A woman found dead after being accused of trolling Madeleine McCann’s parents had sent thousands of Twitter messages about the couple, it was revealed yesterday. Brenda Leyland, 63, tweeted that she ‘hated’ Kate and Gerry McCann and launched online diatribes about their behaviour in the aftermath of their daughter’s disappearance. But unlike other ‘internet trolls’, she did not appear to have made threats against the couple and her death prompted outrage from some over the decision to expose her. Divorcee Mrs Leyland was found dead in a hotel room on Saturday, three days after she was unmasked as one of dozens of online critics who had posted messages about the McCanns. Facebook groups and online petitions called for a public inquiry into Sky News’s decision to confront her over the Twitter messages and subsequent newspaper coverage. Ofcom received 60 complaints about the Sky News report, which did not name Mrs Leyland but referred to her by her Twitter name @sweepyface. A spokesman for the broadcasting regulator said: ‘It’s important to stress that we’ve not reached a view as to whether an investigation will take place.’ A dossier of online abuse has been passed to prosecutors which included threats against the McCanns and their twins, now aged nine. There is no suggestion the threats were made by Mrs Leyland. The mother-of-two began tweeting about the case in December 2010, when she accused others of ‘unhelpful and uninspired trolling’, and since then she sent 4,625 messages, almost all of which were about the McCanns. This year alone she had sent 2,136 tweets and on some days she would send more than 50 messages attacking the McCanns’ behaviour, including their use of public donations and their decision to sue their critics. Scroll down for video . When she was confronted by Sky News reporter Martin Brunt about the Twitter messages attacking the couple, Mrs Leyland initially refused to speak but then replied: ‘I’m entitled to do that.’ Hate: Speaking before Mrs Leyland's death, Gerry McCann (pictured with wife Kate) said his family had faced 'vile' abuse for seven years and he had 'grave concerns' about letting his twins use the internet unsupervised . Scene: Mrs Leyland’s body was found at a Marriott hotel (pictured last night) in Leicester on Saturday . Speaking later from her home in Burton Overy, Leicestershire – 15 miles from the McCanns’ home – she said: ‘I regret what I’ve done.’ Still missing: Madeleine McCann vanished in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in 2007 . Her body was found at a Marriott hotel in Leicester on Saturday and police will investigating said officers ‘will look into the circumstances surrounding and prior to her unexpected death’. Madeleine McCann, then aged three, went missing in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in 2007. Speaking before Mrs Leyland’s death, Mr McCann said his family had faced ‘vile’ abuse for seven years and he had ‘grave concerns’ about letting his twins use the internet unsupervised because of the hate campaign. He said he had not seen the comments from Mrs Leyland. Sky News said in a statement: ‘We were saddened to hear of the death of Brenda Leyland. It would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further at this time.’","Brenda Leyland, 63, tweeted that she 'hated' Kate and Gerry McCann .

"The wanderings of polar bears are of particular interest to scientists studying the effects of global warming. And now a tool allows people to watch polar bears as they pad across the ice of Hudson Bay, Canada, from the comfort of their homes. The Bear Tracker shows the current location of a number of polar bears as well as sea ice levels in the area. Click on a polar bear to view its details... By clicking on a bear in the interactive map, you can see what date it was collared, how many cubs it has, its weight and the distance it has travelled. There is also an option to sponsor the bear. The map, created by Winnipeg-based Polar Bears International, can also be used to see the shrinking of areas of sea ice over the past 30 years, as water temperature are believed to have risen. ‘We’ve discovered some incredible things about polar bear movement patterns while they are on the ice, such as the fact that a single female bear can travel more than 2,485 miles (4,000 kilometres) in a single season,’ said Polar Bears International’s Kevin Middel. Scroll down for video... The Bear Tracker shows the current location of a number of polar bears as well as sea ice levels in the area . The map, created by Winnipeg-based Polar Bears International, can also be used to see the shrinking of areas of sea ice over the past 30 years by sliding a counter on the top of the page . Polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt and store energy for the summer and autumn. Sea ice now melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the autumn in the bears’ southern range. As the bears spend longer periods without food, their health declines. Unhealthy bears can lead to lower reproduction rates - and local extinction. Scientists have found the main cause of death for cubs to be either lack of food or lack of fat on nursing mothers. For every week earlier the ice breaks up in Hudson Bay, bears come ashore roughly 22 lbs (10 kg) lighter and in poorer condition. Many ecologists fear that polar bears face an uncertain future as they rely on sea ice to hunt and store energy for the summer and autumn when food is hard to come by. Sea ice now melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the autumn in Hudson Bay. As the bears spend longer and longer periods without food, their health and strength declines, which in turn means less cubs and the prospect of extinction. While the future seems bleak, scientists insist that there is still time to save the large mammals, which is key to understanding changes happening in the Arctic. The organisation said that by tracking polar bears they will better understand how the population is faring. ‘Most of what we know about polar bears we know from capturing them and then releasing them alive at the site of capture,’ they said. By clicking on a bear in the interactive map, you can see what date it was collared, how many cubs it has, its weight and the distance it has travelled. There's also an option to sponsor the bear . ‘Capture efforts repeated regularly over multi-year periods also allow for an estimation of reproduction and survival rates, along with estimations of population size.’ Each spring and fall, scientists put new satellite collars on a small number of bears to follow the bears’ movements, habitat use, fidelity to areas, and the survival of their cubs. Sensors also allow scientists to detect how much time the bears spend in the water, which is important in reference to arctic sea ice loss. Collars are designed to fall off on their own in 14 months. Scientists collar only female bears because male polar bears’ necks are as wide as their heads and collars slip off. ‘For me, it’s not only exciting to make use of technology in research right now, but it’s exciting to imagine what might be possible in the future,’ Mr Middel said.

"A wealthy property developer is being taken to court after refusing to tear down a giant £2,500 playhouse he built in his back garden for his children. Jeffrey Morris, 40, and his wife Louise Cook, 45, erected the 12ft wooden playhouse in the grounds of their £800,000 home in the Northamptonshire village of Horton for their young daughters. When neighbours complained their properties were overlooked, they dismantled it and put it back up without a wooden platform, but they were told they were still in breach of planning law and had to take it down. Jeffrey Morris, Louise Cook and daughters Amelia, left, and Poppy, in front of the controversial playhouse . The property developers, pictured right with Amelia, left, and Poppy, bought the playhouse two years ago . Mr Morris says that he has complied with the issues raised at the start but believes the council 'wants a scalp' The problem began two years ago when the Morris family bought the playhouse for their 300ft back garden. South Northamptonshire Council complained the structure, which 11ft high, 19ft wide and 9ft deep, caused 'significant harm to the character and appearance of the area' and ordered it to be removed. The couple complied and rebuilt the house without its wooden platform but were told it still breached planning law and given an enforcement notice ordering them to remove the playhouse, which consists of a swing set, slide and tree house. When the couple refused to comply, they refused they were ordered to Northampton Magistrates' Court, where they denied breaching an enforcement notice. Mr Morris told magistrates: 'The supplier Leisure Time Products confirmed to us we didn’t need planning permission because the full height was under four metres and the planning officer said the same. 'We proceeded on that basis and eight months went by. 'It was only when neighbours began to criticise South Northamptonshire Council for not doing their job well enough that the council looked into it again.' Edge of the village: The family's house is ringed, while the yellow dot indicates where the playhouse is . The Morris-Cook family lives in an £800,000 stone house in the village of Horton, south of Northampton . Mr Morris says the firm he bought the playhouse from in 2011 told him it did not require planning permission . If they lose the case they could face a maximum £20,000 fine plus court costs and still be forced to rip the playhouse down. The couple claim they were told by planning officers during site visits that the platform was the only issue, but that after taking it apart, making several adjustments and reassembling it, the officers said they had still breached the enforcement notice. Mr Morris, who lives has lived in the detached stone house since 2005 with his wife and their three children, Charlie, 20, Amelia, 12, and Poppy, nine, said:  'We were assured by the company that the playhouse did not require planning permission and it was up for 11 months before someone complained to the council. 'The platform was the floor of the . little treehouse bit of the structure so to show good faith we took the . floor out but now the council claim the ledge near the slide constitutes . a platform. Quite palatial: The £2,500 playhouse boasts a slide, climbing wall, swings, and an impressive treehouse . 'A planning officer bizarrely told me one way to comply with planning law would be to build a large shed covering the playhouse to make it an indoor play area which did not need planning permission. 'It’s crazy because that would mean building something even bigger.' Mr Morris added: 'In my view the council are desperate for a scalp and because we are property developers they have come after us and are using bully tactics to make us tear it down. 'At the court hearing the council officers told me they would pursue the maximum £20,000 fine plus court costs. 'I refuse to take this lying down and I will not be bullied so I am putting my money where my mouth is and will fight them because I know I am in the right.' A trial will take place in March next year at Wellingborough Magistrates’ Court. A spokesman for South Northamptonshire Council said the construction of garden sheds, garages, tree houses, and play equipment was allowed without planning permission if they didn't have a balcony or raised platform over 300mm, had only a single storey, and if were more than two metres from a boundary if over 2.5m high. He said: 'The development in Horton did not comply with any of these criteria.' Councillor Rebecca Breese said: 'The council has consistently informed the applicant that the structure was unauthorised and required planning permission. '[The council's] enforcement notice has not been complied with, despite repeated requests to do so and left the council with no other option but to prosecute the site owner.'","Jeffrey Morris, 40, and his wife Louise Cook, 45, bought house in 2011 .

"With a manager as combustible and as clever as Jose Mourinho, you always know that he is going to blow at some stage of the season. By highlighting Anthony Taylor’s performance at Southampton, where the referee gave Cesc Fabregas a yellow card for diving, Mourinho created some hysteria. That was a carefully orchestrated move by Mourinho, delivering the same message in each of his post-match press conferences with equal conviction. Jose Mourinho's comments about referee Anthony Taylor were a calculated move designed to heap pressure on officials in the all-important Premier League title run-in, possibly to Chelsea's benefit . Mourinho criticised Taylor after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving during Chelsea draw at Southampton . Fabregas was infuriated by Taylor's decision, believing he was fouled and deserved a penalty . At face value it looked like he was trying to attack pundits, experts and analysts. By turning his fire on them, and away from the referee, he avoided an FA charge. But his real target was referees. The title race could be decided by a referee’s decision and Mourinho wants to influence them. At White Hart Lane on New Year's Day, Phil Dowd is on notice and will be well aware that Chelsea have not been awarded a penalty away from Stamford Bridge this season. That is an incredible statistic. Dowd is one of the most volatile referees in the Barclays Premier League. Whenever he booked me he would flash the card so quickly that it felt he was about to punch me. Dowd treats players like little boys and can inflame and aggravate situations. He really used to wind me up. This is a big test for him, a big night at White Hart Lane for Tottenham, and it comes just a few weeks after Mauricio Pochettino’s team lost 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. Speaking on Sky Sports, Mourinho claimed that officials have a 'campaign' against Chelsea . The Chelsea boss clearly feels that decisions have gone against his team at key moments this season . Fabregas reacts with incredulity after being booked for simulation after going down in the area . Chelsea currently have a three-point advantage at the top of the Barclays Premier League . Dowd’s last Chelsea match was their 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. He sent off Branislav Ivanovic in the 90th minute and Robin van Persie equalised 45 seconds later. If there are any tricky decisions to be made tonight, Dowd might have Jose’s comments ringing in his ears. Mourinho is a brilliant team builder. He quickly identifies areas he needs to improve and creates a cause like no other manager in the Premier League. It can work as a real positive energy. He is a trophy hunter and there is a lot of silverware to be won before he is done with English football. But his team, for all their quality, are stuttering on their travels after losing at Newcastle and drawing at Sunderland and Southampton. It is easy to criticise a referee, to distract people from a performance, but I believe his recent comments were deliberate because he showed restraint. He did just enough to create headlines and debate — and to get inside the heads of referees. Mourinho is a master manipulator, using situations to his advantage, and he knows the pressure is on Chelsea in the second half of the season. Manchester City are lurking in striking distance. At some stage his dressing room will feel tension because they are leading from the front and are expected to win their first Premier League title since he returned to Chelsea. Boot Room preview for Tottenham vs Chelsea on New Year's Day . Mourinho was left furious after Branislav Ivanovic was sent off in the late stages at Old Trafford . Robin van Persie scored United's equaliser seconds after Ivanovic was sent off at Old Trafford . At Arsenal we had all sorts of little psychological ploys to gain an advantage before kick-off. Mourinho works the same way. We would never come out of the dressing room at Highbury until the opposition were waiting for us in the tunnel. We are Arsenal, we decide when we come out. In matches against Manchester United I would deliberately shield the officials as they came off the pitch at half-time so that Sir Alex Ferguson could not get to them. In games of this magnitude, you will seize upon any little advantage. Mourinho must keep his players onside, convince them that they are the best team as they enter this crucial second half of the season. Chelsea players do dive. They have had four yellow cards for simulation this season and there is a reason for that — our eyes are not deceiving us. Clearly, though, Mourinho wants to create an ‘us against the world’ mentality. Eden Hazard kept Chelsea on track with his equalising goal at Southampton on Sunday . Fabregas is brought down by Southampton's Matt Targett in the incident that started the debate . Mourinho goes mad on the touchline after Chelsea appeals for a penalty are waved away . That attitude can really bond a group because if you feel you are hard done by, you are even more determined to play well. The other, more subtle impact is on referees. There is no doubt Mourinho makes comments like these to increase the pressure on officials. Still, complaining in such exaggerated terms about Chelsea being victimised does not cast him in a good light. His team are top of the League and playing some of the best football ever seen at Stamford Bridge. He doesn’t need to complain, just win matches. No-one wants to see a whingeing manager win trophies and as brilliant as Mourinho is — he’s one of the best — he might want to keep a lid on what he is saying. When he came back to Stamford Bridge he talked about staying a long time. To do that he needs to make friends, not enemies. Just when we were starting to like him again he overstepped the mark at Southampton. He has self-destructed at previous clubs and had to leave. He can’t afford to do the same again. There isn’t a campaign or witch-hunt against Chelsea but Mourinho has stepped up the pressure on match officials at a crucial stage of the season. Tonight it will be fascinating to see how Dowd handles it.","Jose Mourinho alleged a campaign by referees against Chelsea this week .

"An educational video warning schoolgirls about Asian grooming gangs was commissioned for schools in 2007 but was never promoted in the UK amid fears of appearing racist. The 20-minute film, My Dangerous Loverboy, features an Asian man in his 20s grooming a younger white girl - lavishing her with gifts and getting her drunk before forcing her to have sex for money. It was commissioned by child protection chiefs based in Yorkshire following reports of vulnerable girls being passed around groups of men for sex, according to a TV producer who worked on the project. Scroll down for video . The 20-minute film, My Dangerous Loverboy, features an Asian man in his 20s grooming a younger white girl - lavishing her with gifts and getting her drunk before forcing her to have sex for money . Despite winning plaudits at international media festivals, the video was hardly used as it was thought not to be politically correct, the Sunday Mirror reports. Yorkshire has since been shaken by the revelation that 1,400 girls were abused by Asian gangs in the town of Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. The female TV producer, who preferred not to be named: said: 'The project was set up to specifically raise schoolkids' awareness of the dangers. 'The police and social workers were very clear it was Asian men who were seducing white British girls. 'I can't help wondering how many girls the film might have saved from being sexually exploited if the UKHTC and police had put their needs before political correctness.' She said that men would find young girls in shopping centres and win their affections before forcing them to have sex with their male friends. Despite winning plaudits at international media festivals, the video was hardly used as it was thought not to be politically correct . The movie was produced by a company called Eyes Open Creative, who say the aim was to 'open up people's eyes to the harsh realities of sexual exploitation'. It was also commissioned by the UK Human ­Trafficking Centre (UKHTC), which is now part of the National Crime Agency. At the time of its release, the UKHTC said: 'We want this film to create awareness of the circumstances in which this kind of exploitation can occur, and encourage vigilance from everyone in a position to notice the behavioural and physical signs that indicate abuse.' A spokesman from The National Crime Agency today said: 'The film was officially launched in 2010 and the annual Safe and Sound conference. It was not suppressed. 'It was put on the UKHTC website, sent to every police force and to child protection agencies.' The video was commissioned by child protection chiefs based in Yorkshire following reports of vulnerable girls being passed around groups of men for sex, according to a TV producer who worked on the project . They were unwilling to offer a comment on why it was never made compulsory for schools and was only seen in a few classrooms. Shaun Wright, head of children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2010, resigned as Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire last week following weeks of intense pressure to quit. Joyce Thacker, director of children's services at the time of the scandal also quit on Friday. The resignations follow last month's report, from Professor Alexis Jay, which indicated that at least 1,400 children were abused between 1997 and 2013 in Rotherham amid widespread failings by authorities. The devastating report made 'painful reading' for the police force covering the town, its chief constable admitted. Martin Kimber, chief executive of Rotherham Borough Council, also stepped down after the findings, which suggested that the authorities were too scared to take action against the gangs for fear of appearing racist. Over the 16-year period, children as young as 11 were sexually exploited by gangs of men – most of them of Pakistani origin.","The 20-minute film was commissioned by child protection chiefs in Yorkshire .

"The analysis of MH370's erratic final movements paints a terrifying picture of the doomed flight's last moments, with an expert saying they fit the pattern of a pilot on a suicide mission who wanted to crash the plane in one of the world's most inaccessible areas. The remote crash site, now tracked to 2,500kms off Australia's west coast, means salvage teams might never recover the plane's black box, which would leave the flight's fate forever shrouded in mystery. If that's the case, it would mean the family of a pilot, passenger or crew member responsible would still be eligible for compensation payments. The stunning analysis follows reports Malaysian police have made MH370's pilot the key focus of their immediate investigation, with officers interviewing Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's family and friends about his behaviour and mindset in the days leading up to the flight. Meanwhile, authorities have again been forced to call off the search for debris, with bad weather hampering their efforts for the second time in just three days. Scroll down for video . 'Last joyride':The pilot was upset over his marriage breakdown and was 'not in the right frame of mind to be flying' Troubled mindset: Investigators are now focusing on Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, interviewing friends and family about the pilot's state of mind . Authorities have been able to piece together a rough snapshot of the mystery flight's final moments. Shortly after its final voice communication on March 8, flight MH370 reportedly climbed suddenly to between 43,000 and 45,000ft where it remained for 23 minutes. Military radar then picked up the plane flying as low as 5,000ft. The distance to the now-defined crash site means the plane must have then climbed to a normal cruising altitude of around 35,000ft before eventually plunging into the southern Indian Ocean... Family troubles: Zaharie Ahmed Shah, captain of Malaysian flight MH370, with his family . One experienced pilot told MailOnline that the sudden climb could have been a tactic to incapacitate the passengers and crew, ruling out a mechanical failure and instead blaming 'deliberate human interaction'. He said the drop to 5,000ft could have been to re-pressurise the plane, before climbing again to its normal cruising altitude, before: 'flying to a remote location where you know no one would ever find it. That way insurers would still pay out to your loved ones.' If the cabin was to be depressurised at 45,000ft, experts say, passengers and crew would only have about 15 seconds of functional consciousness before beginning to pass out. Any one without access to a bottled oxygen supply - like the one found in the cockpit - would be dead in minutes. Australian aviation security expert, Mark Bishop, said that at that height, even the masks that automatically drop from the ceiling - which mix oxygen with cabin air -  would only extend consciousness for up to 15 minutes as their flow isn't strong enough to stave off the effects of hypoxia at that altitude. 'Even with the oxygen out, it would only give them 15 minutes or so,' he said. 'Eventually they'd pass out even with their masks on.' Search abandoned: Thursday's salvage mission had to be aborted due to bad weather. It's the second time in three days the planes and boats have been ordered back to base. International effort: the search team now includes military from Australia, USA, Japan and China . The high-ranking officer told USA Today that the investigation's immediate focus was pilot, saying that nobody else aboard the plane was capable of the maneuvers they now know the plane made shortly before  dropping off radar. Captain Zaharie's son, Ahmad Seth, says he has 'ignored all the speculation' around his father . Captain Zaharie's son, Ahmad Seth, today broke his silence, saying he has 'ignored all the speculation' around his 53-year-old father since the plane mysteriously disappeared en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur 19 days ago. And the 26-year-old, Captain Zaharie's youngest son, says the family has yet to accept the official ruling that all 239 people on board are dead, insisting they will wait for physical evidence. I've read everything online. But I've ignored all the speculation,' he told the New Strait Times. 'We may not be as close as he travels so much. But I understand him. 'Now, we are just waiting for the right confirmation. I will believe it when I see the proof in front of my eyes.'","Analysis of MH370's final, erratic movements could point to a suicide mission, experts claim .

"The businessman who has built his own toll road around a road closure in Somerset should be knighted in the next honours’ list. He is an inspiration. By taking matters into his own hands to solve the chaos caused by a 14-mile diversion on a busy commuter route, Mike Watts has set a shining example to anyone who has ever moaned about public services. Faced with months of roadworks and upheaval, and the loss of business at the party supplies shop he runs with his wife Wendy in Bath, the pioneering  52-year-old didn’t just complain. Scroll down for video . Mike Watts at the Kelston Toll Road, which be built after becoming sick of roadworks causing massive detours . Enterprising: He spent £150,000 on the gravel track next to the A431 in Kelston and charges driver £2 a day . He put his money and his effort where his mouth is, rented a nearby field and built an alternative road to allow traffic to bypass the closure, charging drivers £2 each way. He spent £150,000 on the gravel track next to the A431 in Kelston and says he will probably spend that again to maintain it. He says he only wants to break even before December when the council is due to re-open the proper road, which was closed after a landslip. Of course, the council has been quick to question his efforts, citing that mealy-mouthed old staple — health and safety. Rather than thanking him, they’ve subjected Mr Watts to all sorts of snooty checks and inspections. Well, they must be furious. They have been utterly humiliated by him. He has shown up the jobsworths at the town hall who say a road closure cannot possibly be dealt with swiftly and efficiently — by sorting it out swiftly and efficiently himself. But it’s not just the council that should sit up and take notice of this have-a-go-hero. If you ask me, this is a lesson for us all about what can be achieved if individuals stop whingeing about parlous public services and take action. He spent £150,000 on the gravel track next to the A431 in Kelston and says he will probably spend that again to maintain it . The motto for the toll road is 'Helping to keep Bath and Bristol on track' Mr Watts only wants to break even before December when the council is due to re-open the proper road . Mr Watt’s pioneering spirit is a tonic in an age where, all too frequently, we seem resigned to failure. Too often in this country, apathy holds the day. We Brits are too good at enduring bad service. Typically, we mutter crossly under our breaths, forgetting that we once possessed a Blitz spirit that made ordinary citizens capable of great feats of endeavour to keep this country going against the odds. I wonder sometimes if we have been brainwashed into believing the nonsense we are fed by officials. The fact is that the authorities who fob us off with laughable excuses about unfathomable train delays or roadworks that have been dragging on for years need more people like Mr Watts to put the proverbial boot up their behinds. Source of the trouble: The A431 near Bath, which is closed until December . Thankfully, there are encouraging signs that Mr Watts may not be alone, that our spirit of defiance and perseverance may be re-emerging — chiefly, I might say, through the efforts of the middle-aged and the elderly. Take retired grandmother Margo Kirk, for example. Fed up with a lack of bus services to and from her Dorset village two years ago, Mrs Kirk, 63, decided to start her own. Just five months later, the community of Milborne St Andrew had a new service called Bus2Go. People in Tiverton, Devon, have been repairing potholes themselves after becoming fed up with a bumpy road that damaged their vehicles. It might sound daunting at first, but Collipriest Lane was easily improved after 16 households donated £10 each to buy asphalt to patch potholes caused by heavy traffic. In Highgate, North London, residents recently employed their own private security firm to patrol their streets after a spate of break-ins. Having asked police for more patrols to no avail, those living in Sheldon Avenue and Stormont Road decided to pay for a private firm to patrol their streets in a security van. Police have now had to admit that there has been a sharp fall in burglaries and vehicle crime in the area since the patrol was set up. Aerial view showing the Kelston Toll road on the left and the main road on the right . In and around the Lancashire village of Wennington, 100 or so locals — most grey-haired — are so fed up of waiting on the Government’s promises of high-speed internet broadband that they embarked on a voluntary community project to lay the necessary fibre optic cables themselves, digging trenches and connecting homes. And in Essex, residents  frustrated by long waits to see a GP are trying to start their own medical centre. The bid to run a GP surgery funded directly by the community in Wivenhoe is particularly intriguing because it has echoes of the Free Schools initiative started by former Education Secretary Michael Gove. If parents can set up a school where there is sufficient local demand, why not have the same principle for GP surgeries, or for hospitals, parks, policing and bin collections for that matter? If people are prepared to put in the effort, could this be the future of public services? Realistically, until there is a sea change in funding principles, public-spirited individuals will have to bear the cost. But it need not be a deterrent. In South London, where I live, I have often thought how liberating it would be if the residents of my street could club together to hire a private garden-waste collector. 'I am convinced businessman Mike Watts lead the way in showing us it is worth the effort' writes Melissa Kite . Lambeth Council charges £35 a year to issue us with green canvas bags stamped with a permit which we must fill with our hedge clippings and grass cuttings. But even though the service is on top of our council tax, they often refuse to take bags for petty reasons. I was once told my bag couldn’t be collected because it was ‘contaminated’ — an inch-long piece of cellophane from a cigarette packet was on the top of the greenery. It must have blown into the bag which was left on the street for collection. But the council still refused to take it. Why should we put up with this nonsense? It would only take a man with a van for hire to drive along the street once a week to collect garden trimmings and take them to the local dump — then we would be free of this horrendous meddling. We could easily pay him with the money for the council’s  garden waste collection permits. And we would be  treated as proper customers — unlikely to be refused service for ‘infringements’. With a little fine tuning we could extend the principle to other kinds of waste, perhaps starting with bulky items binmen won’t normally touch. The possibilities are endless. I often wonder what might be achieved if people stopped demanding action and took action themselves. Recently, I have been involved in a campaign in Surrey, where I ride horses, to save a local beauty spot which is being increasingly abused by people who want to have sex in public. 'Of course, the council has been quick to question his efforts, citing that mealy-mouthed old staple — health and safety' The so-called ‘dogging’ site at Ockham Common just off the A3 has deteriorated over the years until there are now people openly performing sex acts near picnic areas where there are children playing. Walkers, horse-riders and parents have been fobbed off by the police, who say they haven’t the resources to put in CCTV cameras — and intimate that they don’t want to install them anyway, because the doggers are a minority who have the right to express their sexual orientation. Perhaps we could club together and install our own cameras. The police would probably take action then — against us. But it would be an interesting test case if it went to court and it might embarrass the authorities into  making sure the beauty spot reverts to its rightful use. If those who rule us do not do what they ought to do, the public will do it instead. We might be accused of  meddling or taking the law into our own hands, but I am not advocating that we all become vigilantes. All I am saying is that sensible initiatives taken by a public at its wits’ end because of official inertia can work wonders — and might even shock bureaucrats into pulling their socks up. Needless to say, it is a blasted cheek that taxpayers have to stump up money and put in their own effort to sort out the neglected state services we’ve already paid for. But I am convinced businessman Mike Watts — along with all the local entrepreneurs who have restored bus services, filled potholes and demanded their own surgery — lead the way in showing us it is worth the effort. Perhaps this is what David Cameron meant when he talked about The Big Society. If so, he will surely be delighted to hear that his idea is finally getting off the ground.","Businessman Mike Watts spent £150,000 of his own money to build toll .

"Wayne Rooney admits Manchester United's top priority when they face Liverpool on Sunday will be to stop Luis Suarez - a player he regards as one of the very best on the planet. United have enjoyed supremacy over their old foes over the last two decades, but the tables have turned this season, with United 11 points behind the Merseysiders, who are second in the Barclays Premier League. A quick glance at the goals scored column shows why Brendan Rodgers has enjoyed a far more successful season than David Moyes. VIDEO Scroll to watch Moyes, Rodgers and Fowler preview Sunday's clash .

"He ordered an Uber cab for his 18-mile trip home after attending a Halloween party with friends. But when Elliott Asbury went to pay, he wished he hadn't contacted the online taxi service at all. Incredibly, he was told he owed a staggering $539.09 for the 25-minute journey from Jefferson County Government Center in Golden, Colorado, to his apartment near I-70 in Denver. The enormous fare was due to Uber's dynamic pricing - also known as surge pricing - which is used on busy nights, such as Halloween, as a way to quell demand and attract more drivers. Scroll down for video . Shocked: Elliott Asbury (pictured) was charged a staggering $539.09 for an 18-mile taxi ride from Jefferson County Government Center in Golden, Colorado, to his apartment near I-70 in Denver on October 31 . A breakdwon of the price: The enormous fare was due to Uber's dynamic pricing - also known as surge pricing - which is used on busy nights, like Halloween, as a way to quell demand and attract more drivers . Despite being warned of the multiplied rates when he ordered the cab via smartphone last Friday - a rule that Uber applies to all customers - Mr Asbury described his total fare as 'outrageous'. Speaking last Saturday, he told KDVR: 'Me and my bank account got taken for a ride last night. You just wouldn’t stand there and be like, ‘Hmm, is this  going to cost me half a grand to get home?’ 'The thought just wouldn’t even cross your mind. I was expecting $44, $50, $60, $100 on the outside. We got there and he pressed the thing on his phone and it said $539 and nine cents.' Mr Asbury said his fare - which was 7.4 times more what his normal rate would have been ($72.85) - even shocked the driver, who repeatedly apologized to him.

Making a loss: The reveller (pictured) added that his fare - which was 7.4 times more what his normal rate would have been ($72.85) due to the surge rates - even shocked the driver, who repeatedly apologized to him . App: His high fare was also due to the fact he accidentally ordered a premium Black Car, instead of a cheaper UberX ride. He also failed to spot a button that would have estimated his fare in advance (pictured) '(The driver) was shocked, he was embarrassed actually,' he said. 'He gave me his card and he was like, ""Make phone calls. Get in touch with customer service. This can’t be right"".' The following day, Mr Asbury contacted the taxi firm's customer service line as suggested, but was told that his price was correct in accordance with the surge pricing. In a statement, a spokesman for Uber - known for its cheap rates and fast service - said the firm's dynamic costs allowed it to remain 'the reliable choice, even on the busiest nights of the year'. In Mr Asbury's case, his high fare was also due to his inexperience with the Uber smartphone application, which connects passengers with cab drivers and allows them to track their vehicle.

It comes just a day after a Baltimore woman revealed she had racked up a $362.57 Uber cab bill after spending a night drinking with friends for her 26th birthday. Gabrielle Wathen, who was also traveling last Friday, Halloween, was charged nine times the standard rate for the entire 22-minute ride back to her apartment.

"'Ginger gene': Couples attending an exhibition are expected to be keen to discover if they could produce red-headed children (file picture) Couples are being offered DNA tests to see if they are carrying the ‘ginger gene’. Organisers of a heritage show are bracing themselves for an influx of couples keen to discover if they could produce red-headed children. Carriers of the gene variant can have ginger children even if neither parent has red hair. A simple DNA test, available at the Who Do You Think You Are? Live exhibition at Olympia in London next month, can identify carriers. Dr Jim Wilson, chief scientist at BritainsDNA – the ancestry company behind the test – said: ‘Through a simple saliva test to determine deep ancestry, we can also identify whether an individual is a carrier of any of the three common red-head variants in the gene MC1R. ‘This means that families can carry a variant for generations, and when one carrier has children with another carrier, a red-headed baby can appear seemingly out of nowhere.’ It is estimated that about four in ten people carry the red-head gene variant without having red hair themselves – accounting for many surprise births of babies who are red-headed. About 40 per cent of men and women in Ireland carry a red head variant, but only 10 per cent have red hair. In Scotland, just over 30 per cent are known carriers and up to 13 per cent have red hair, while in England only 6 per cent of people have red hair. On the Continent, only about 1.3 per cent of people are red-headed, getting much rarer heading towards the south-east. When counting the entire world population only just over 0.5 per cent (one in 200) have red hair, which is nearly 40million people. Identifying carriers: Couples can get DNA tests to see if they are carrying the 'ginger gene' (file picture) About one in four of the children of two carriers will be born with red hair and half will themselves be carriers. 'Families can carry a variant for generations, and when one carrier has children with another carrier, a red-headed baby can appear seemingly out of nowhere' Dr Jim Wilson, BritainsDNA . Half of the children of a carrier will also inherit the variant, even if their other parent is not a carrier. Recent research indicates millions of Britons carry ‘silent’ genes for redheadedness. While this does not turn their hair ginger, it may expose them to a range of increased health risks that afflict redheads. These can include increased sensitivity to pain, skin cancer, Parkinson’s disease and even Tourette’s syndrome.","Simple DNA test available at exhibition at Olympia in London next month .

"To her mother, Gakirah Barnes was a funny and sweet charter graduate who loved music and 'was liked by everyone'. But to the gangs of Chicago's notorious South Side, she was a 'young killa' who went by the names 'Tyquanassassin' and  'Tookaville’kirah', rumored to have committed her first murder at the age of 14. Some claim she was involved in up to 20 gangland deaths. But on Friday April 11, at 17-years-old, Barnes was gunned down as she walked to have lunch at a friend's house in Woodlawn about 3.30pm, shot a reported nine times in the chest, neck and jaw. 'Mythical': Gakirah Barnes, a prominent name among Chicago's South Side gangs, was purported to have killed two people, one when she was just 14-years-old. Following her shooting death earlier this month, she has been immortalized on social media and YouTube . Gakirah Barnes (left) - seen here in a rap video called 'Murda' produced by members of the the Fly Boy Gang that she ran with - was executed on April 11 in Chicago . In Memoriam: This montage of photos of Gakirah 'Lil Snoop' Barnes has been circulated on Twitter following her shooting death in Chicago's South Side . Scene: The 17-year-old was shot up to nine times by a hooded gunman as she walked to a friends house around 3.30pm on April 11 on the 6400 block of South Eberhart Avenue . Likeness: Barnes was nicknamed 'Lil Snoop' after the The Wire character Snoop (pictured), played by Felecia Pearson, a cold-blooded Baltimore assassin . Mourning: Gakirah Barnes' mother Shontell Brown said her 'sweet and loving' daughter is not the person she has been shown to be . Some 45 other people were shot on the same weekend in the city that has come to be called 'Chiraq' - a brutal nickname used to describe today's Chicago in terms of its danger and crime - six of which were children. But Barnes has since become something of a mythical figure online, immortalized in YouTube memorials and rap videos as 'Lil Snoop', a reference to the fictional 'Snoop' character from TV series The Wire - a cold-blooded killer from the harsh streets of Baltimore. Barnes' father was shot to death on Easter Sunday in 1997, when she was less than 12-months old. 'She just wanted to protect everybody,' her mother, Shontell Brown, explained in a lengthy feature on Gakirah Barnes in The Daily Beast. As Barnes entered her teens, she fell in with a group of young men in her South Side neighborhood of Woodlawn who called themselves the St. Lawrence Boys or the Fly Boy Gang. Following the death of 15-year-old Shondale 'Tooka' Gregory, who was shot to death as he waited for a bus in January 2011, the Fly Boys became the 'Tooka gang' and the surrounding area 'Tookaville'. Barnes changed her Facebook name to 'Tookaville' kirah'. Eight months later, a 20-year-old opposing gang member named Odee Perry was shot and killed. Barnes was almost immediately linked to the death, with online postings labeling her the 'hitta'. She was 14-years-old at the time. While Barnes was never named a police suspect, one street figure Tweeted: 'lol so odee was killed by a girl smh [shaking my head]'. The opposing gang memorialized Odee by christening its home turf as 'O Block'. A major turning point for Barnes was the killing of 13-year-old Tyquan Tyler, whose mother had moved him from Chicago to western Illinois to get him away from the city's violence. Tragedy: Tyquan Tyler, who Barnes treated like a baby brother, was shot by a stray bullet and killed in June 2012. He was only 13 . Tyquan's death is said to have marked a change in Gakirah Barnes, who Tweeted thereafter she 'had no heart (and) no feelings' He returned for a visit in June 2012 and was killed by a stray bullet when two gang members fired into a crowd of youngsters who were leaving a party. Tyler's mother was on her way to pick him up. 'I held him in my arms on the sidewalk and talked to him while he was fighting for his life,' she told the Chicago Tribune. Barnes grieved as if Tyquan had been her little brother and would often refer him as such online. She adopted the vengeful Twitter handle 'Tyquanassassin' on his behalf. 'Tyquan supposed 2 Be hear wit me But instead Lil bro ended up 6 feet under a million miles away,' she Tweeted. 'Tyquan left a n--a Wit no heart no feelings.' In July 2013, the Fly Boy Gang posted a music video on YouTube simply called 'Murda', with the main rap lyric: ' My young ni--as they're gonna murder.' Barnes appears peripherally in most of the video, but takes center focus during the line 'K.I. my young killa'. At one point she is seen holding an automatic pistol toward the camera, in others she is covering her face with a bandana. 'Young killa': Gakirah Barnes covers her face as she appears in the 'Murda' video in early 2013, measuring up to her much-older male counterparts . The 'Murda' video was an attempt for members of the gang to be noticed by record labels and hopefully be signed as artists, as some of their rivals had already done . The Fly Boy's were sending out a clear message with the video, attempting to get the attention of music producers and record labels who had recently taken a huge financial interest in gritty street rap performed by people who were actually 'living' their songs, and not writing about 'thug life' from a condo in Los Angeles. Keith 'Chief Keef' Cozart, a member of rival gang Black Disciple - the O Block gang - had already been signed by Interscope, moving from the South Side to a mansion in the suburbs and recording songs that derided the Tooka clan. On April 9, the 30-year-old cousin of Chief Keef,  Mario 'Blood Money' Hess, was shot and killed. Online postings would soon name Barnes, again, as the 'hitta'. The police did not name her as a suspect, but she posted on Twitter the next day:  'u Nobody until Somebody kill u dats jst real Shyt.' Around the same time, police shot and killed Raason 'Lil B' Shaw, a Tooka, after he allegedly pulled out a gun during a foot chase, according to The Daily Beast. Barnes named her Twitter page 'NO SURRENDER LIL B.' On April 10, the day before her death, she Tweeted: 'I Dne seen 2 many of my ni--az n a casket…In da end we DIE.' That same day, a rapper named Lil Jay with the Fly Boy Gang taunted Blood Money's friends by posting a video of himself drinking a red-hued beverage from a Styrofoam cup, singing: 'Sippin' on Blood Money.' The next day a hooded gunman approached Barnes 6400 block of South Eberhart Avenue, with the blast of bullets sending her falling onto some wooden steps, The Chicago Sun-Times reported. Gruesome: Blood from Gakirah Barnes' gunshot wounds stain the steps on which she fell . Scene: Barnes was walking down this street when she was shot by a hooded gunman, who remains at large . 'They killed my little ni**a snoop #restuptyqanaassassin,' a Fly Boy Gang associate tweeted. Police have not named any suspects in Barnes' execution and no arrests have been made. As Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube filled with stories of her, rumors and truths coming to light for the first time, Barnes' mother said she believes social media is is a huge part of the problem with the new-age gangland wars, because it provides a platform for boasting and derision that previously hasn't existed. It can also make you famous. 'All those kids and rappers talk like Jesse James. Everyone wants to be the biggest and the baddest,' she said. 'This is life in Chicago.'

"The White House, Members of Congress and the international community reacted swiftly, but with varying levels of intensity, on Wednesday after reports from Syria indicated that the Bashar al-Assad regime had killed at least 1,300 people with a chemical weapons attack. While the White House held its cards close to the vest, some in Congress were quick to blame the Obama administration for inviting genocide through a weak posture abroad. There are 'no consequences for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line,' Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain said in a tweet. 'We shouldn't be surprised he's using them again.' Scroll down for video . Devastated: A man and woman mourn over the dead bodies of Syrian men after an alleged poisonous gas attack fired by regime forces . The 'red line' comment refers to comments President Obama made a year ago, promising that the use of chemical weapons against Syrian rebels would bring a game-changing shift in U.S. posture toward Assad's often brutal regime. 'We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground,' Obama said on August 20, 2012, 'that a red line for us is [if] we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus.' However, at an afternoon press conference the White House continued to deflect demands that it must take unilateral action against the regime. 'This is and should be a top priority of the United Nations,' said Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest in a briefing with journalists. The UN Security Council has scheduled a 3:00 p.m. emergency meeting to debate a response, but Russia - Syria's principal ally - can veto any proposal. But 'there is work,' Earnest insisted, 'that can be done with our international partners to try to continue to pressure the Assad regime.' 'Those that are responsible for the use of chemical weapons -- if it's determined that that's what happened -- will be held accountable,' he said. But when reporters pressed Earnest on whether President Obama is 'willing to use the stick along with the rhetoric' on Syria, he quipped that it was 'a philosophical question which I think is a legitimate one.' 'It might be better answered by the Commander-in-Chief himself.' Killed: Activists say dozens of children were among those killed by gas attack in al-Ghouta . Remains: A building is left barely standing after shelling by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad . A reporter then asked, 'Are you going to bring him out?' Earnest . refused to speculate on whether the U.S. actions to date have caused . Assad to feel enough pressure to consider ceding power to a . democratically elected government. 'There . are a range of consequences' that the administration has sought, he . said. 'It's hard for me to speak to whether or not he [Assad] feels . threatened.' But he . acknowledged that 'steady escalation of aid that has been provided to . the Syrian opposition,' along with humanitarian aid and negotiations . with the international community, ... 'has not resulted in the outcome . that we would like to see, which is the complete removal of Assad from . power.' Earnest . dismissed a similar question about whether there was a 'red line' that . Egypt's military rulers had crossed by killing more than 1,000 . pro-Muslim Brotherhood protesters in Cairo. 'I didn't bring my red pen out here with me today,' he said. Earnest . insisted that a UN inspection team, which has been on the ground in . Syria since Tuesday, should be allowed to investigate the sites of . alleged chemical weapons use before the U.S. or any other country mounts . an organized response. 'We think it's important for that investigative team to be given access to that area,' he said. He . would not comment, however, on whether or not a 'red line' would be . crossed if the Assad government interferes with that investigation or . refuses to grant the UN team access to critical sites, including those . shown in videos that circulated online Wednesday. Russia, too, has urged an 'objective' investigation into the footage and reports. Russian . President Vladimir Putin remains Assad's most powerful ally, in part . because Syria hosts its last remaining naval base on the Mediterranean . Sea. But Reuters reported Wednesday afternoon that Russia's Foreign Ministry has claimed pro-democracy rebels in Syria may have staged the attack in order to provoke international reactions against Assad. On Jan. 31, Russia and China blocked Security Council plan demanding that Assad hand over power to his deputy and allow a general election, and promising unspecified 'further measures' if he did not comply. Turkey, meanwhile, castigated the Assad regime for employing 'unacceptable violence' against his own people, according to a translation provided to MailOnline. 'If the allegations are true,' said the statement from the country's foreign affairs minister, it would constitute 'a crime against humanity' In an earlier statement today, Earnest said the administration was 'deeply concerned' by the news filtering out of Syria, and called on the UN to investigate further. Survivor: A boy weeps after surviving gas attack . 'The United States strongly condemns any and all use of chemical weapons' Earnest said in a statement. 'Those responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held accountable.' 'Today, we are formally requesting that the United Nations urgently investigate this new allegation. The UN investigative team, which is currently in Syria, is prepared to do so, and that is consistent with its purpose and mandate.' If it's established conclusively that the chemical attacks did occur near Damascus, as rebel groups have alleged, they would have been carried out while the UN inspectors were on the ground nearby. Syria, meanwhile, has said via its state-controlled media that there is no truth to the accounts.","UN convenes emergency meeting in response to reports and footage that hundreds including children were killed .

"Zeppelins were once considered the future of air transport - but after the horror of the Hindenburg disaster, they disappeared from the skies for more than 75 years. Now a pioneering aviation firm hopes to bring back the airships in a bid to revolutionise the global market in transporting freight. The Aeroscraft is built using innovative technology which allows it to control its flight better than previous airships, so it should avoid the problems experienced by the first generation of zeppelins. Scroll down for video . Revolutionary: The Aeroscraft airship, pictured during testing, is set to reintroduce the zeppelin to the world's skies . Nearly ready: The zeppelin is set to have its first full test flight, and will roll off the production line from mid-2015 . It requires only a third as much fuel as an aeroplane carrying cargo, and it can take off and land anywhere even without a formal airstrip - including on water - making it well suited to war zones and disaster areas. The aircraft has been designed thanks to a $3million grant from the U.S. government, and it will soon be ready for its first test flight, according to Business Insider. The Aeroscraft is designed by Worldwide Aeros Corp., who predict that it will change the way that goods are moved around the world by providing a mode of transport which is cheaper than planes but faster than ships. The key technological breakthrough came when the firm's founder Igor Pasternak came up with a way to compress helium, which allows the airship to control its weight. Impressive: The new age of the zeppelin relies on technology which compresses helium to allow better control of the aircraft . Pilots: Similar to a conventional aeroplane, the Aeroscraft has a pilot and a co-pilot sitting in the cockpit . Lift-off! The appeal of the new-style blimp comes from the fact that it costs just a third as much to fly as an aeroplane . Watch more videos about the Aeroscraft here . The Aeroscraft can take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, so it can visit destinations which do not have an airport. This means that even though its 115mph average speed is much slower than a jet aeroplane at 500mph-plus, the overall travel time could be lower because it can travel directly from where goods are produced to where they are needed. Worldwide Aeros hope that this will make it useful to the military and aid charities operating in parts of the world with poorly developed infrastructure on the ground. Market: The firm behind the airship insists that it will be perfect for any company involved in transporting goods . Testing: The manufacturers will be hoping to avoid the safety problems which plagued early generations of zeppelins . It may seem flimsy compared to a metal jet, but the Aeroscraft has bulletproof skin, and even if its exterior is breached it does not deflate like a balloon. The firm claims that its first airships will be available to customers in mid-2015, when they will be rented out for a year at a time. A model of the zeppelin which carries 66 tonnes will cost more than $25million per year, while a 250-tonne version will be $55million.",The Aeroscraft can take off and land without an airstrip meaning it can operate even in war zones and disaster areas .
"As sultry jazz singer Jessie Taylor in BBC2’s new drama Dancing On The Edge, Angel Coulby has wowed critics with her amazing vocal performance.

Sultry: Angel Coulby has wowed critics with her amazing vocal performance, despite never having sung in public before she won the role of Jessie Taylor . Hidden talents: Angel Coulby had not even told her agent that she could sing before auditioning for director Stephen Poliakoff . ‘What is so extraordinary is that Angel hadn’t told her agent she could sing and she had never sung in public before,’ he said. ‘When we were casting, we decided to have open auditions because we thought we would need a professional singer who could act on the side. ‘Angel turned up very late in the process and had to audition for us at Ealing Studios without musical accompaniment. 'But as soon as she opened her mouth, we knew we had found our Jessie.

"Refugee Samo Ilyas Ali has nine children to feed but he can't focus on the future because the sounds of women and children crying out for help while being buried alive by Islamic State militants in northern Iraq often consume his mind. Tens of thousand of Yazidis fled their ancient homeland of Sinjar and other villages to escape a dramatic push by the Sunni militants who regard the ethnic minority as devil worshippers who must embrace their radical version of Islam or die. The refugees sit idle in camps in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq. Scroll down for video . Displaced Iraqis gather to receive clothes provided by a charity at a new camp in the town of Feeshkhabour . About 1.5million people have been displaced by fighting in Iraq since the Islamic State's rapid advance in June . A young girl smiles as health workers administer polio and tetanus vaccines to Iraqis in the background . Traumatized by Islamic State militants notorious for beheadings and mass executions, they have simply given up on Iraq and want to go as far away as possible; to countries like Germany, worlds away from their mysterious customs. U.S. air strikes against Islamic State positions and vows by Kurdish commanders to recapture Yazidi villages provided no reassurances. It's easy to see why. Ten days ago, Ali and his fellow villagers were suddenly surrounded by Islamic State militants with machine guns at night. They had long beards. Some had face masks and Arabic writing on the sides of their heads. Absent from the scene were Kurdish peshmerga, or 'those who confront death', fighters who had held parts of the north and were seen as the only force that could stand up to Islamic State after thousands of U.S.-trained Iraqi soldiers fled their advance, leaving them with heavy weapons including tanks . Suddenly the men began digging ditches - soon to become mass graves. 'We did not understand. Then they started to put people in those holes, those people were alive,' said former grocery shop owner Ali, 46, pausing to weep. The Yazidi in the north of the country have suffered badly at the hands of the vicious Islamic State forces . Refugee Iraqis smile as they carry new clothes provided to them by a charity organisation . 'After a while we heard gunfire. I can't forget that scene. Women, children, crying for help. We had to run for our lives, there was nothing to be done for them.' It was not possible to independently verify these accounts. Some of the Yazidis escaped with the help of Turkish and Syrian Kurdish fighters. But similar scenes are reported in several parts of the north. In some of the most recent bloodshed, militants massacred at least 80 Yazidi men in Kawju village because they refused to convert to Islam, Iraqi officials said. Women and children were abducted. Reports from northern Iraq describe ISIS forces beheading people and in some instances burying them alive . Islamic State seemed most intent on killing members of Iraq's majority Shi'ite sect, which it considers to be heretical. During Islamic State's latest offensive in the north, minority Yazidis and Christians have suffered the most. The Yazidis, followers of an ancient religion derived from Zoroastrianism, are spread over northern Iraq and are part of the country's Kurdish minority. Many of their villages were destroyed when Saddam Hussein's troops tried to crush the Kurds. Some were taken away by the executed former dictator's intelligence agents. Now they feel helpless again. Fellow Kurds abandoned them. Iraq has a new prime minister who is seen as moderate and may be less inclined to engage in disputes with the Kurds over budgets and oil than his predecessor, perhaps bringing political stability that could benefit the north. A new camp outside the Bajid Kandala camp in Feeshkhabour town, Iraq . A Kurdish peshmerga fighter flashes the V for Victory sign as his group head to the front line near Mosul . But many Yazidis have lost faith in Iraq and its leaders. They have few options. Some complained that Kurdish forces would not let them travel to Turkey. So for now, it seems all they can do is wait, and try to forget what caused them to flee their homes. 'They put women and children under the ground. They were alive. I still hear their screams. They were trying to keep their heads up to keep breathing,' said car repairman Dawud Hassan, 26. 'Iraq is finished for me. We had houses, shops, they all burnt our things. We have nothing. We want to cross to Turkey but the peshmerga is not letting us. We will not stay there, we want to go to Europe.' It is not clear if Iraqi government forces or peshmerga will manage to claw back territory and then hold it - something that could help Yazidis believe in their country again. The peshmerga fighters are some of the only people able to help defend the Yazidi from ISIS persecution . Islamic State is getting more ambitious. It has already grabbed much of the north and resources such as oil fields that will help fund its self-proclaimed caliphate. Some Yazidis, like Hassan, 22, a student, shake their heads in disbelief when recalling how only foreign Kurdish fighters from Turkey or Syria extended a lifeline in the face of Islamic State. 'They tied the hands of one woman to the back of a car and her legs to another car and they split her into two,' he said beside makeshift tents as women cried. 'Have you seen anything like this? This is all because she is not Muslim and did not want to be converted. We barely made it.' Peshmerga forces, aided by U.S. military strikes, have recaptured the strategic Mosul Dam .","Survivor's account describes women and children being buried alive .

A hospital source said he is 'coming back to life'. He will also be subjected to psychological tests. Police believe the man, said to be a former city hall worker, was involved in a fight in another part of the city, where he was badly beaten by his attackers until he passed out and was taken to the cemetery by his assailants. It is believed they then threw him into a empty grave which was partly filled with earth. When the victim regained consciousness, he began making groaning noises which alerted the woman who found him. The anonymous man was found partly covered with soil at a cemetery in a suburb of Sao Paulo, Brazil . Officers said they are convinced more than one person was involved in the assault, adding it was a 'despicable vendetta' that could have ended in tragedy if the woman had not chosen to visit her family's grave. The attack is the second of its kind in Brazil in the last three months. In September, a homeless man who was beaten over the head with a shovel by three teenagers in the Brazilian capital Rio de Janeiro was found buried alive on the city's Leblon Beach. The teenage attackers also tried to suffocate the man with a plastic bag before stripping him naked then burying him in the sand in the early hours. A witness to the assault reported the crime anonymously but the man, who was taken to hospital but not identified, died after being rescued by police. The suspects were arrested at the scene.","Woman visiting family tomb in Sao Paulo, Brazil, said she heard noises .

"A Russian oligarch ordered to pay out a world-record £2.7billion to his ex-wife views the settlement as a 'hammer blow' and may appeal, it emerged today. Judges in Switzerland said Dmitry Rybolovlev, 47, has to give Elena Rybolovleva, who was with him for 24 years, a very precise 4,020,555,987 Swiss francs and 20 centimes. In current sterling rates, this amounts to £2,681,297,538 and 78 pence – an estimate of half the Russian oligarch’s entire fortune. Marc Bonnant, Ms Rybolovleva's clearly . delighted lawyer, said the figure represented an 'amicable settlement' after six years of tough negotiations. Scroll down to see video . Monaco Football club's Russian president Dmitri Rybolovlev, pictured left, has been ordered to pay a world record divorce settlement of more than £2.6billion to his ex-wife Elena Rybolovleva, right . Dmitri Rybolovlev, left, who made his billions through a successful fertiliser business, must make the payment following a six-year court battle. He is pictured at an AS Monaco football match with a woman who is not his wife . But Mr Bonnant also admitted that it was 'the most expensive divorce in history' and that Mr Rybolovlev viewed the astronomical sum as a 'hammer blow'. Mr Bonnant said the billionaire had 'put up strong resistance' and tried to conceal the full extent of his assets via offshore ventures. The Geneva court's decision can now be appealed by Mr Rybolovlev, who met his wife more than 30 years ago when they were students in the Ural mountains. It follow a six-year legal saga in which Mr Rybolovlev, who made his billions through a successful fertiliser business, bitterly contested Ms Rybolovleva’s claims to two of the most expensive properties in the USA and a £100million Greek island. Now . Mr Rybolovlev must sign a cheque for the incredible sum in the Swiss . city of Geneva, where Mrs Rybolovleva lives in a lakeside mansion. Dmitry Rybolovlev owns Maison de l'Amitie, a 54,000 sq ft French Regency-style house, sitting on more than seven manicured acres of prime waterfront on the barrier island of Palm Beach, Florida . Dmitry Rybolovlev purchased Donald Trump's Maison de l'Amitie in Palm Beach, Florida, for $100million . Elena Rybolovleva alleged that her husband purchased this three bedroom plantation style property in Kauai in Hawaii from Will Smith for $20 million . Dmitry Rybolovlev bought the Greek island of Skorpios from the Onassis dynasty last year for a reported £100 million, again for his daughter, a socialite show jumper . The . settlement is far higher than the £1.5 billion paid by art heir Alec . Wildenstein to his ex wife, Jocelyne, which until now had been the . largest confirmed public divorce settlement in the world. Rupert . Murdoch, the media mogul, was told to give his former wife, Anna, . £1billion in 1999. He went on to marry his third wife Wendi Deng, from . whom he is now divorced. Mr . Rybolovlev, who was found by the court to be worth £5.2 billion - . although the figure is believed to be a conservative estimate of his . wealth - and his ex-wife have been at war since 2008 over the terms of . their divorce. Ms . Rybolovleva won custody of the couple's 13-year-old daughter Anna, . along with Mr Rybolovlev's half of their former home in Cologny, an . up-market neighbourhood of Geneva. In 2012, . Mrs Rybolovleva claimed a £50 million plus ownership of the New York . penthouse which her ex-husband had bought for Anna. The . purchase of the penthouse from the former head of the Citigroup bank, Sandford . I.Weill and his wife Joan, was at the time the most expensive home ever bought in New York City.

Watching the field: Rybolovlev is pictured with an unidentified woman at a gootball match in Saint-Etienne on March 1 of this year . A second occasion: Rybolovlev is pictured with an unidentified woman, who is believed to be the same companion as from the football match, at an event in Monte Carlo on May 17 . In . court papers filed in Manhattan, Ms Rybolovleva had said Mr Rybolovlev . had been using marital property to buy a multitude of other assets . through a variety of trusts and limited liability companies, hoping to . put those assets beyond her reach. Mrs Rybolovleva said these assets . include his majority ownership of French soccer club AS Monaco, a $295 . million stake in the Bank of Cyprus, and a $95million Palm Beach, Florida, home purchased from another tycoon, Donald Trump. Mr . Rybolovlev is one of the small group of Russians who became fabulously . wealthy during the post-Soviet privatization of the economy and became . known as oligarchs. He is the former owner of fertilizer business . Uralkali. Mr Rybolovlev also owns a £12million Hawaii mansion he bought from the Hollywood star, Will Smith, and La Belle Epoque penthouse in Monaco, where he lives, for which he paid £178 million. He bought the Greek island of Skorpios from the Onassis dynasty last year for a reported £100 million, again for his daughter, a socialite show jumper. Beautiful: Dmitri Rybolovlev purchased a $88 million apartment on Central Park West for his daughter Ekaterina Rybolovleva - for her studies while at college in New York . Luxury: The 6,744 sq ft apartment boasts 10 rooms, a wrap-around terrace, library and seven walk-in closets . The island . was made famous as the location of Aristotle Onassis's wedding to the . former US First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, in 1968. Mr Rybolovlev's wealth came from the sale of his stake in Uralkali, a Russian fertiliser business, for $6.5billion in 2010. He went on to buy AS Monaco in December 2011, attempting to make the club as successful as Qatari-owned Paris Saint Germain. Mr . Rybolovlev, who lives in Monaco, also has an estate in the southern . French resort of Saint Tropez and his assets include an art collection . with paintings by Picasso, Van Gogh, Gauguin and Monet. Since splitting from her husband, Mrs Rybolovleva has been followed almost round the clock by private detectives. In February, she was questioned by police in Cyprus on suspicion of stealing a diamond ring reportedly worth £15 million, borrowed from her daughter but not returned, and which belonged to a trust. She was released without charge. The Russian oligarch has a majority ownership in AS Monaco, whose stadium is pictured. It plays in the French league but is actually based in the Principality of Monaco, close to two of its marinas. She was by Mr Rybolovlev's side as he rose from a doctor-turned-entrepreneur into a stockbroker and banker, before becoming chairman and majority shareholder of Uralkali. They stayed together during his 11 months in jail - when he was accused of murdering a competitor before the charges were dropped - and when threats on his life led him to wear a bullet-proof vest and move his family to Switzerland. He was said to be stunned when he found out about the divorce petition on New Year's Eve 2008 from his bankers, after his accounts were frozen. In that petition, the then Mrs Rybolovleva said she could no longer take his infidelities, describing parties on yachts where, she said, he had shared some 'young conquests with his friends, and other oligarchs'. The sumptuous Monaco penthouse where Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev lives was once the scene of an arson attack that killed a previous billionaire owner. The 17,500 sq ft flat La Belle Epoque, which was bought by Mr Rybolovlev for £178million, is not only the largest in Monaco, but also offers stunning views over the Mediterranean. It was previously owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum of the Dubai Royal Family who paid some £200million in 2010, then believed to be the most expensive residential property sale ever. The beneficiaries of that transaction were British property developers Nick and Christian Candy, who are thought to have made a profit somewhere in the region of £155million. That was in despite of its macabre history. For the brothers had bought the property in 2006 from the widow of billionaire Lebanese banker Edmond Safra, who was killed inside the flat in an arson attack. Mr Safra, 67, was found dead alongside his nurse in a locked security room after a fire was started by his servant, a former Green Beret special forces soldier who was jailed for 10 years. The servant claimed he started the blaze so he could then save Mr Safra and gain the plaudits. The Candy brothers reportedly paid £10-£15million for the penthouse in 2006 then spent around £30million on an 18-month renovation in their signature Candy & Candy style. According to The Pinnacle List: 'The pioneering confidence and desire to push existing boundaries of décor allowed Candy & Candy to set a new bespoke luxury design standard in elite residential interiors, making the La Belle Epoque Penthouse a kind of modern equivalent of a historical palace fitting a Medici or a Versailles.' But it is not without its modern touches. Each suite in the two-floor flat is believed to come with its own cinema with screens that emerge from the walls, a kitchen and two bathrooms. The property also has its own spa, library and a leisure room with billiard tables and arcade games.","Dmitry Rybolovlev ordered to pay record amount to Elena Rybolovleva .

"Maryland will become the 18th state to abolish the death penalty . The strongest advocate to end the death penalty in Maryland is Kirk Bloodsworth . Bloodsworth was convicted of murder in Maryland in 1985 and was the first person in the U.S. to be sentenced to death row then exonerated by DNA evidence . 32 other states across America still support the penalty usually by electric chair or lethal injection . Lawmakers in the state of Maryland have today approved a measure that will abolish the death penalty. The bill is expected to be signed by the Democratic governor who has long pushed for banning capital punishment in the state. If the measure is signed by Gov. Martin O'Malley, it will make Maryland the 18th state in the nation to do away with the death penalty. The Governor: Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, center, speaks at a news conference in Annapolis, Maryland after the Maryland General Assembly approved a measure to ban capital punishment . A repeal bill won final passage from the House of Delegates on Friday. It already had been approved by the Senate. The House advanced the legislation this week after delegates rejected nearly 20 amendments, mostly from Republicans, aimed at keeping capital punishment for the most heinous crimes. If passed, life without the possibility of parole would be the most severe sentence in the state. Supporters of repeal argue that the death penalty is costly, error-prone, racially biased and a poor deterrent of crime. Jubilant: Anti-death penalty advocates Sylvester Schieber, left, his wife, Vicki, center, Kirk Bloodsworth, the first American sentenced to death row who was exonerated by DNA . The man pictured in today's jubilant scenes from the Maryland state capitol is that of 53-year-old Kirk Noble Bloodsworth. He was the first American sentenced to death row who was exonerated by DNA fingerprinting. An honorably discharged former Marine and Maryland resident, Bloodsworth was convicted in 1985 of sexual assault, rape, and first-degree premeditated murder for the 1984 rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl in Rosedale, Maryland. Even though five eyewitnesses had placed him with the victim, he continued to maintain his innocence throughout his trial and subsequent incarceration. In 1992, while in jail, Bloodsworth read an account of how DNA fingerprinting had led to the conviction of Colin Pitchfork in the killings of Dawn Ashworth and Lynda Mann; hoping to prove his innocence, he pushed to have the evidence against him tested by the then-novel method. Initially, the available evidence in the case — traces of semen in the victim's underwear — was thought to have been destroyed; however, when eventually located (in a paper bag in the judge's chambers), testing proved that the semen did not match Bloodsworth's DNA profile. In 1993, Bloodsworth was released; by that time, he had spent almost nine years in prison, two of them on death row. Though released from prison, Bloodsworth was not formally exonerated until 2003 when prisoner DNA evidence added to state and federal databases identified the real killer: Kimberly Shay Ruffner. Opponents say it is a necessary tool to punish lawbreakers who commit the most egregious crimes. Maryland . has five men on death row. The measure would not apply to them . retroactively, but the legislation makes clear that the governor can . commute their sentences to life in prison without the possibility of . parole. The state's last execution took place in 2005, during the administration of Republican Gov. Robert Ehrlich. He . resumed executions after a moratorium had been in place pending a 2003 . University of Maryland study, which found significant racial and . geographic disparity in how the death penalty was carried out. Capital punishment was put on hold in . Maryland after a December 2006 ruling by Maryland's highest court that . the state's lethal injection protocols weren't properly approved by a . legislative committee. The committee, whose co-chairs oppose capital punishment, has yet to sign off on protocols. O'Malley, a Catholic, expressed support for repeal legislation in 2007, but it stalled in a Senate committee . Maryland has a large Catholic population, and the church opposes the death penalty. In 2008, lawmakers created a commission to study capital punishment after repeal efforts failed again. The panel recommended a ban later that year, citing racial and jurisdictional disparities in how the death penalty is applied. In 2009, lawmakers tightened the law . to reduce the chances of an innocent person being sent to death row by . restricting capital punishment to murder cases with biological evidence . such as DNA, videotaped evidence of a murder or a videotaped confession. 18th State to abolish: Maryland will become the sixth state in as many years to replace capital punishment with life in prison without parole. According . to the Maryland Department of Public Safety & Correctional Services . website, Maryland has executed only five inmates since 1976. In contrast, neighboring Virginia has executed 110 inmates since the U.S. Supreme Court restored capital punishment in 1976. However, . Virginia's death row population has dwindled to eight from a peak of 57 . in 1995, in part because fewer death sentences are being handed down in . the state amid an increased acceptance of life without parole as a . reasonable alternative. Death penalty: Maryland has five men on death row but the new legislation allows the governor to commute their sentences to life in prison without the possibility of parole. MDs execution took place in 2005. Death sentences have declined by 75 percent and executions by 60 percent nationally since the 1990s. Connecticut abolished the death penalty last year. Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico and New York also have outlawed it in recent years.","Maryland will become the 18th state to abolish the death penalty .

"The co-founder of Pinkberry yoghurt was today found guilty of using a tire iron to brutally beat a homeless man who flashed a sexually explicit tattoo at his fiancee. Millionaire Young Lee, 47, attacked Daniel Boulding with the metal bar on June 15 2011 after he was approached by the victim asking for money. Lee, who now faces up to seven years in jail, became upset after Bolding had flashed a tattoo depicting a stick figure of a couple having sex to the people in his car, including Lee's fiancée. He drove away but returned with another man to beat Bolding. Guilty: The co-founder of frozen yogurt giant Pinkberry has been convicted of beating a homeless man with a tire iron while the victim begged on the side of an East Hollywood street . How it all began: Lee, a kick-boxer-turned-architect-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang. They opened their first location in West Hollywood in 2005, gaining a celebrity following and sparking a frozen yoghurt craze . Words were exchanged, and Lee and another man in a rented SUV chased the man to attack him with a tire iron. Lee's defense attorney Philip Kent Cohen claimed the man made threats to his client as if he had a weapon, but police say it was a sexually explicit tattoo on the homeless man that triggered Lee to get out of his vehicle and go after the victim. According to prosecutors, court documents show Lee viewed the tattoo as a sign of disrespect. He . demanded the homeless man kneel and apologize, but even after the man . consented, police say Lee proceeded to kick and beat him with the tire . iron. Jail sentence likely: Young Lee, stands with his attorney Philip Kent Cohen. Lee has been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for striking a homeless man with a tire iron. He could face up to seven years in prison . Korean-born Young Lee began frozen yoghurt chain Pinkberry with his business partner Hye Kyung Hang in 2005 - and the brand has since grown from one store in Los Angeles to more than 100 across the country. The chain's rapid growth made Lee a wealthy man and he owned a luxury home with a fleet of luxury cars including a Rolls-Royce Phantom and Ferrari 599 GTB at the time of his arrest. A number of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian number among Pinkberry's devoted fan following, and the company prides itself on having 'groupies' across the country. Lee left the company in 2010. Phillip Kent Cohen, Lee's attorney, said he and the prosecutor agreed on '96% of what happened: that there was a tire iron and that [Bolding] was given great bodily injury.' But Cohen said his client never held the tire iron, and he attempted to cast doubt on the testimony of witnesses who identified Lee as the attacker, including saying that Bolding had 'flat-out lied.' In the initial police report, Cohen said, Bolding alleged that he was arguing with the driver, whom he identified as Lee. Bolding said the man in the passenger seat had the tire iron. But during the trial, Bolding testified that Lee had beaten him with the tire iron. Bolding has also filed a personal injury lawsuit against Lee seeking damages for the attack. After the beating, Lee traveled to Korea and England. He was arrested Jan. 30, 2012, at Los Angeles International Airport by a fugitive task force. The jury deliberated for less than two days before reaching a guilty verdict in the three-week-long trial. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Henry Hall said that evidence during the trial showed that Lee had made significant threats to witnesses and considered him a 'threat to the community.' Lee was arrested after a witness called police and gave the license plate number of the Range Rover involved, which was rented in Lee's name. Lee, a kick-boxer-turned-architect-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang. They opened their first location in West Hollywood in 2005, gaining a celebrity following and sparking a frozen yoghurt craze. Lee faces up to seven years in state prison when he is sentenced on January 14, 2014. He was not granted bail.","Young Lee, 48, became upset in June 2011 that Daniel Bolding had flashed a tattoo depicting a stick figure of a couple having sex .

"A super computer has become the first in history to pass the Turing Test, a benchmark of artificial intelligence set by codebreaker Alan Turing (pictured) A super computer has been created which can simulate human conversation so well that it has convinced people it is a teenage boy. The machine is the first in history to pass the ‘Turing Test’ - a benchmark of artificial intelligence set by codebreaker Alan Turing. The World War Two computing pioneer devised the test in 1950. He said that if a machine is indistinguishable from a human, it is ‘thinking’. Now a computer programme called Eugene, developed to simulate a 13-year-old boy, has now managed to convince 33 per cent of judges that it is human. No computer had ever previously passed . the Turing Test, which requires 30 per cent of human interrogators to . be duped during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations. Five . machines were tested at the Royal Society in central London to see if . they could fool people into thinking they were humans during text-based . conversations. Professor . Kevin Warwick, from the University of Reading which organised the test, . said: ‘In the field of artificial intelligence there is no more iconic . and controversial milestone than the Turing Test. ‘It is fitting that such an important landmark has been reached at the Royal Society in London, the home of British science and the scene of many great advances in human understanding over the centuries. This milestone will go down in history as one of the most exciting.’ The successful machine was created by . Russian-born Vladimir Veselov, who lives in the United States, and . Ukrainian Eugene Demchenko who lives in Russia. Mr Veselov said: ‘It’s a remarkable achievement for us and we hope it boosts interest in artificial intelligence and chatbots.’ The computer programme called Eugene (pictured) was developed to simulate a 13-year-old boy. During tests it managed to convince 33 per cent of judges that it was human . Professor Kevin Warwick from the University of Reading, pictured following a previous experiment to build a cybernetic arm, said the computer passing was an important milestone . Prof Warwick said there had been previous claims that the test was passed in similar competitions around the world. ‘A true Turing Test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations,’ he said. ‘We are therefore proud to declare that Alan Turing’s test was passed for the first time.’ Prof Warwick said having a computer with such artificial intelligence had implications for society and would serve as a ‘wake-up call to cybercrime’. The event took place on the 60th anniversary of the death of Mr Turing, who laid the foundations of modern computing. During the Second World War, his critical work at Britain’s code-breaking centre at Bletchley Park helped shorten the conflict and save many thousands of lives. Instead of being hailed a hero, Mr Turing was persecuted for his homosexuality. After his conviction in 1952 for gross indecency with a 19-year-old Manchester man, he was chemically castrated. Two years later, he died from cyanide poisoning in an apparent suicide, though there have been suggestions that his death was an accident. Last December, after a long campaign, Mr Turing was given a posthumous Royal Pardon. The Turing Test was introduced by Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing in 1950 as part of his paper Computing Machinery And Intelligence in which he predicted that computers would one day be programmed to acquire abilities rivalling human intelligence. He proposed a test called The Imitation Game, which would identify whether a computer is capable of thought. A person, called the interrogator, engages in a text based conversation with another person and a computer - and must determine which is which.If they are unable to do so the computer is deemed to have passed.","Computer programme called Eugene convinced 33% of judges it is human .

Conservative blogger David Burge even tweeted: 'Congrats, vapidly smiling Healthcare.gov splash page stock photo girl! You're now the most despised face on planet Earth.' She responded: 'I don't know why people should hate me because it's just a photo. I didn't design the website. I didn't make it fail, so I don't think they should have any reasons to hate me.' As the ridicule of Adriana continued, there was also speculation that she might not be a legal . resident or eligible for Obamacare. The Mona of healthcare: Adriana's image appeared on the Obamacare website on October 1 . She . said that she is Colombian but has been married to a U.S. citizen for . six-and-a-half years. They live in Maryland with their 21-month-old son. She is a permanent resident applying for citizenship. She explained that her photo appeared on the website after she contacted the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services about having free photos of her and her family taken. In exchange, the images could be used to market the new health care law. She paid nothing and received no payment for the photograph. Even though she gave her permission for the images to be used, she was stunned by the negative reaction once they went live. 'It was upsetting. It was sad,' she said. 'And in a way, I'm glad that my son is not old enough to understand, . because you know whatever happens to you, it hurts them too.' Mocked: The Onion published a story called 'People In Healthcare.gov Stock Photos Now Visibly Panicking' Cruel: Conservative blogger David Burge also attacked Adriana as the 'most despised face on Earth' The photo was eventually removed from the website two weeks ago, which she called a 'relief', and now she can laugh about the whole thing, she said. 'They didn't ruin my life. I still have a . job, I'm still married,' she said. 'That didn't really crush me to . the ground. I'm fine. Now I laugh about it.' A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told ABC News that Adriana's photo was removed simply because 'Healthcare.gov is a dynamic website'. 'We transitioned to new graphics because we believe they provide a better way to visually reinforce key information to users about options for applying at this point in time,' said the spokesperson. Even President Barack Obama's supporters have been critical of the website's performance which has been plagued with problems from the start. Obama said there 'is no excuse' for the glitches.","Woman who appeared on the troubled Obamacare website revealed herself only as 'Adriana' - a married mother originally from Colombia .

"A retired policeman battled for three hours to catch a halibut weighing a whopping 38.5 stone to claim a world record. The super flat fish was so big that at one point Reinhard Wuhrmann's rod snapped in two as he was tried to snare the creature off the island of Senja in northern Norway. The 62-year-old and two others were only able to haul it onto their boat after tying a rope around it when it came alongside. What a catch!: Reinhard Wuhrmann caught this halibut in the north of Norway, it took him three hours to pull the fish in . The 8ft 3in Atlantic halibut tipped the scales at just over 540lb - smashing the previous world record by an impressive 58lb. It would have sold for about £2,500 at a British fish market and made about 1,000 fillet portions. A good quality fish restaurant can charge £25 for a halibut main course, meaning the record fish could have realised a value of £25,000. Despite being very tired after catching the halibut, Mr Wuhrmann still went through with a bet to shave off his beard the men had previously made for netting the biggest fish. Three hour battle: Reinhard Wuhrmann, 62, fought with the monster from the deep for three hours before he and three fishermen colleagues finally detained it . Boat skipper Ulrich Alstetter, 53, said: 'It was an incredible experience and we are very proud. 'Reinhard was very tired afterwards but also intoxicated by the experience and by claiming a world record. 'We had made a bet to shave his beard if he caught the biggest fish. Like a good sport he went through with it.' Ulrich said: 'The halibut took Reinhard's little jigg bait and his rod bent over double. 'We all watched for a few minutes and then it became clear this was going to be a big fish. 'After about 90 minutes of Reinhard trying to reel it in his rod broke in two from the pressure it was under. It was his favourite rod. Supersize: At 8ft 3ins the Atlantic halibut tipped the scales at just over 540 pounds - smashing the previous world record by an impressive 58lbs . 'Because I am taller than him I took what was left of his rod and after another hour the fish was alongside the boat. It was then seen for the first time and it was a huge fish. 'It then shot another 100 metres deep and it took me another 15 minutes to bring him up and another 15 minutes to get a rope around it. 'It was a team effort but Reinhard was the official catcher.' The men each took about 25lb of halibut fillets home and the rest was given away to other anglers and locals. The previous record for an Atlantic halibut was held by fellow German Gunther Hansel who caught a 483lb specimen off Iceland last year. Anglers Bosse Carlsson and Hans-Olov Nilsson caught a 464lbs halibut off Norway in 2009. Before that Danish angler Soren Beck caught a then-record 443lbs specimen in the Arctic Circle off Norway in 2008. The biggest Pacific halibut caught was by Jack Tragis off Alaska in November 1996 with a 459lbs fish. Atlantic halibut - Hippoglossus hippoglossus in Latin - is among the largest bony fish in the world. Their native habitat is the northern Atlantic, from Greenland to the Barents Sea and as far south as the Bay of Biscay. They can reach up to 15ft in length, weigh up to 700lbs and can live for 50 years. Their diet is usually other fish like cod, haddock and herring although they do face predation from seals and the Greenland shark.","8ft 3in Atlantic halibut smashed previous world record by 58lb .

"When a photo emerged of Russell Brand with his arm around the shoulders of a ‘pick-up artist’ banned from Britain, the comedian swiftly distanced himself from his vile techniques. But while Brand declared himself ‘wholeheartedly against’ Julien Blanc’s methods, he appeared to be on shaky ground yesterday when his links to another self-styled seduction guru came back to haunt him. Blanc, 25, who runs a company claiming to teach men how to make women ‘beg’ for sex, had been due to conduct a seminar in Britain this week until more than 136,000 people successfully petitioned for him to be refused a visa. Scroll down for video . Criticism: When this photo emerged of Russell Brand with his arm around the shoulders of Julien Blanc, a ‘pick-up artist’ banned from Britain, the comedian swiftly distanced himself from his vile techniques . Brand, 39, said he was ‘100 per cent’ against Blanc’s methods and that any ‘system for chatting up women is in itself questionable’. However, questions have been raised about his stance after it emerged that he provided a cover quote for a seduction manual called The Rules of the Game by Neil Strauss. In it, the US author advises desperate bachelors to use techniques such as ‘negging’, in which a man tries to subtly insult a woman and undermine her self-confidence in the hope she will become desperate for his approval. Emblazoned on the cover of the 2007 book is a quote from Brand saying: ‘Neil Strauss’s writing turned me from a desperate wallflower into a wallflower who can talk women into sex.’ He also discussed pornography and ‘notches on the bedpost’ when he interviewed Strauss several years ago on a BBC Radio 6 Music show, at one point saying: ‘Okay Neil, teach us more.’ Strauss, 45, who calls Brand a friend, has said the comedian ‘does extremely well as a pick-up artist… When I met him he was intuitively using the principles in the book.’ Endorsement: Brandprovided a cover quote for a seduction manual  by Neil Strauss (pictured) Strauss’s devotees include US-based Blanc, who said his interest in picking up women started when he read one of his books. Critics say his methods, such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends, are abusive and controlling. Footage has also emerged of Blanc using racist language and grabbing women by the throat. One Twitter post says: ‘Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie [spike] your own drink? #JustKidding.’ After he was banned from Britain, Liberal Democrat MP Lynne Featherstone said: ‘Julien Blanc’s presence in the UK could have led to an increase in sexual violence and harassment.’ When a picture emerged online of Brand and Blanc together, the comedian claimed he had not known who he was posing with. He said: ‘I never knew who that was. So many people come up to me all the time. ‘I’m against treating women in a disrespectful way. That whole pick-up thing… seemed appealing to me when I was a kid. Any system for chatting up women is in itself questionable. ‘But any that’s sort of based on objectifying or undermining women I would never, never, never, never, never endorse. ‘So just to be clear, if you’ve got any questions about my attitude towards Julien Blanc or anyone that treats women or anybody disrespectfully, I’m 100 per cent, wholeheartedly against it.’ Blanc was also kicked out of Australia earlier this month when his visa was cancelled after protests about his techniques. He had been due to hold seminars there until December. As the furore intensified last week, he finally apologised for his behaviour and insisted his ‘intentions were never bad’. ‘I’d like to apologise to anyone I’ve offended in any way,’ he said. ‘It was never my intention… I’m extremely sorry for everything that happened.’ Outrage: Critics of Blanc, pictured, say his methods, such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends, are abusive and controlling .","Photo emerged of Russell Brand with 'pick up artist' banned from Britain .

"Baby-faced 'predator: Tyler Kost, 18, from Arizona, has been indicted on 27 felony counts for allegedly committing sex crimes against at least 11 girls between the ages of 12 and 17 . An 18-year-old Arizona high school student has been indicted on nearly 30 felony counts for allegedly sexually assaulting a dozen girls over nearly five years. Charges against Tyler Kost, of San Tan Valley, include multiple counts of sexual assault with a minor, sexual abuse with a minor and sexual conduct with a minor. He also faces one count of child molestation. Pinal County Attorney Lando Voyles said the victims in the crimes alleged in the indictment issued Wednesday ranged from 12 to 17 years old. Voyles said the offenses occurred between October 2009 and April 2014. Kost was born in January 1996 so he was 13 when the first offense allegedly took place. But Voyles plans to try him as an adult on all charges. ‘In Arizona, once an individual turns 18, we don't have a choice,’ Voyles said. ‘[State law] makes it fairly clear.’ During a hearing last week, an attorney for Kost requested a change of venue and a gag order on the Sheriff's Office. The judge said he could not address those requests and told the defense to bring up the issues again once Kost is formally charged. Kost is scheduled to be arraigned May 16. Kost, a senior at Poston Butte High School, would face between 147 and nearly 334 years in prison if convicted of all the charges in the indictment, the prosecutor said. Pinal County sheriff's deputies arrested Kost last week, accusing him of being a serial sex predator who assaulted at least 18 students. Voyles said he could not comment on why the indictment accused Kost of crimes involving only 11 victims. Multiple offenses: Cops say they are approaching 20 victims. There likely will be others that come forward . According . to the indictment, none of the alleged sexual assaults occurred on a . school campus. Kost is accused of sexually abusing the victims in his . bedroom, in a parked car, a park and out in the desert. During a news conference, Voyles encouraged parents of sexual assault victims to report the crimes to authorities. ‘Let your children know that we start by believing,’ he said. Lured teenage girls: Detectives said because he looked young and innocent, many people didn't perceive him as a threat . In . addition to calling Kost a sexual predator, Pinal County Sheriff Paul . Babeu last week said the baby-faced Kost threatened and harassed victims . to such an extent that two fled the state, and one attempted suicide. ‘This is a serious and serial sex offender and rapist,’ Babeu said. The . investigation was initiated after the Sheriff's Office received a call . March 25 from someone reporting that Kost had sexually abused and . molested five teenage girls. Tyler Kost was first jailed April 28 in connection with sex crimes against one victim and re-arrested three days later as sheriff's investigators tied additional victims to the case. In one case, Kost threatened, harassed . and told one of the victims to kill herself, deputies said. The girl . followed through and attempted suicide, but survived and was hospitalized. While . in the hospital, she allegedly got a message from Kost threatening . that if she returned to school he would 'make her life a living hell.' In another case, a girl became pregnant after she was allegedly raped by Kost and ended up getting an abortion, the station KPHO reported. 'He . would assault these young female victims in their own bedrooms, in his . bedroom, in the desert, at a community pool, at community parks,' Babeu . said. Detectives said because he looked young and innocent, many people didn't perceive him as a threat. His alleged victims included girls he had dated. Kost, a senior, has been taking classes online for the past several months after reporting being bullied by several girls. But officials with the Florence Unified School District has said that there is no evidence to support Kost's bullying claims. Nasty man: In one case, Kost threatened, harassed and told one of the victims to kill herself, deputies said. The girl followed through and attempted suicide and was hospitalized .","Tyler Kost, 18, has been labelled a serial sex predator who allegedly targeted teenage girls between ages 12-17 .

"Most parents find two young children cause enough havoc to keep them occupied, but not this family, - who have 145 exotic pets. Jamie and Michelle Mintram, from Weeting, Norfolk, share their three-bed with their two children, plus an array of unusual animals. The family own a baby crocodile, a scorpion, two skunks, an Argentinian horned frog and two Boa constrictors - as well as more than 100 other creatures. Scroll down for video . Jamie and Michelle Mintram and their two children, Josh and Chloe, live with 145 exotic pets in their family home in Weeting, Norfolk . The family's menagerie includes tortoises, snakes, giant rabbits, chameleons (pictured) raccoons, skinny pigs and a baby crocodile . Mr Mintram, holding the baby crocodile, likes lizards and snakes, but his wife prefers furrier critters . Mr Mintram takes in a lot of reptiles as rescue animals but most of the other creatures are the family's pets . Mr Mintram, 39, has a licence to look after the exotic pets and has rescued a number of his reptiles from owners who could not care for them. But most of their staggering collection are family pets, with some of them living in their children's bedrooms. The Mintrams hope to open up a small zoo nearby, which will mainly be made up of rescued animals. Mr Mintram and his wife, 32, met when they were both lab technicians 12 years ago and instantly bonded over their shared love of animals. Since moving in together they have filled every nook and cranny of their detached house and garden with a different animal, including pigs, insects, a hedgehog and a raccoon. Mr Mintram said: 'I have always loved reptiles, but Michelle preferred more furry animals. Watch the full video on Good Morning Britain here. Mrs Mintram, pictured holding her pet raccoon, met her husband at work and they instantly bonded over their shared love for exotic creatures . Mr Mintram and his family live with around 145 animals, and shares his bedroom with some of them . Mr Mintram, who bought his first animal aged 11, has a licence allowing him to look after exotic animals . 'Farther back, my mum bred parrots and parakeets and was a pioneer in captive breeding. It rubbed off on me. 'I bought my first cornsnake at 11 and my collection grew from there, but I never set out to get 145 pets. 'We have so many because we are a rescue sanctuary for exotic animals, which there are not many of.' The couple have more than 30 snakes, including the Boa constrictors, five baby pythons and cornsnakes that live in the garage along with the crocodile, monitor lizard and a shed-load of creepy crawlies. Inside the house, every room, apart from the animal-free the living room, is jam-packed with tanks and cages from floor to ceiling. The Mintrams share their bedroom with two baby tortoises, while their children also house animals in their rooms. Eight-year-old Josh has three chinchillas living in his room, while Chloe, six, shares her room with a pink cornsnake and a yellow budgie. Mr Mintram has collected pets since he was 11 and wants to set up a zoo near the family home . The Mintrams have to clean the house once a day to stop the house from smelling, which was an impossible task on the one occasion that the skunks sprayed their bedroom . Their house may look normal from the outside, but the Mintram family home houses 145 creatures . 'It's nothing unusual for [the children] to see me coming home with a raccoon or a crocodile,' said Mr Mintram. The animal-mad family clean the house and gardens every day so the smell never gets too pungent, but the skunks, which have their own toilet, once sprayed in the bedroom, leaving an acrid stench for days. Unsurprisingly, looking after so many animals can be expensive, with the food bill reaching £100 a month and Mr Mintram striking a deal with a local greengrocer to cut down the cost. 'We also have to fork out about £250 a month for heating as many of the animals require a constant heat source,' Mr Mintram said. 'We have a number of scorpions and the shiny burrowing scorpion is always trying to sting me. 'And the boa constrictor is not the friendliest - but we wouldn't swap any of them for the world.'

"If you've ever needed proof that cutting down on the chocolate biscuits is a quick way to lose pounds, then this is it. Teenager Emma Day, 18, has lost nearly half of her body weight simply by giving up her favourite sweet treats, and now weighs a svelte 8 stone 11lbs. What's more, her diet success has paid off in more ways than one, as the pretty blonde now has modelling agencies knocking at her door. Addiction: Emma used to munch her way through piles of chocolate biscuits every single day . Change: Pretty Emma has shed almost half of her body weight by ditching the biscuits . Emma’s biscuit bingeing started in primary school and by the time she left, she weighed more than 12 stone. By 13, she was tipping the scales at 15 stone and had become the target of cruel jibes from school bullies. Emma, who hails from Dewsbury and is training as a make-up artist, said: 'I was one of the first girls to hit puberty and it was horrible. I would just come home and comfort eat a whole packet of chocolate digestives. 'I also drank about seven hot chocolates every day. Some nights I would go to my grandma’s for supper and then come home and have a second one with my mum. I hid the junk food I ate from my mum.' Bullies, who harassed her every day and once even physically attacked her with a tennis racket, only made the biscuit binges worse. Petite: Slender Emma has lost so much weight she's made it into the second round of Miss Teen Queen UK . Inspiration: Emma's mother helped her daughter to lose weight and beat cruel bullies . 'It was just awful and for about two years it was really bad,' says Emma. 'I was always off school and would pretend I was ill. 'I remember one time I ate raw chicken to make myself sick so I didn’t have to go in to school.' Eventually Emma's mother intervened and helped her to swap biscuits for salad. The pounds started to drop off almost immediately. 'I started eating fruit and vegetables instead of biscuits and snacks,' says Emma. 'I used to have sugary cereal or biscuits for breakfast but now I have fat free yoghurt and fruit I feel so much healthier.' A part time job as a waitress also helped to speed up the weight loss thanks to the physical effort required to wait on tables and carry piles of plates. 'I’m always running around and on my feet,' says Emma. 'There’s no way I could have done that before. No thanks! Emma's new look diet includes plenty of healthy salads, lots of broccoli and two Rich Tea biscuits . 'I can now run around without getting tired and I am so much more toned. Talking to people at work has given me my confidence back too. 'I was told every day that I was a fat nerd. I only had one friend and absolutely no confidence. I was afraid to talk to people and kept myself to myself, but now I just don’t hold back. 'I feel so much healthier now. Before I wouldn’t even wear trousers because I looked awful in them. 'Now I can wear anything I want and I have so much confidence. My mum calls me a chatterbox because I will talk to anyone.' So much confidence has Emma gained, she even felt able to enter Miss Teen Queen UK and, much to her delight, has made it through to the second heat. She said: 'My friends made me sign up to the pageant and I totally forgot about it until I got a letter through my door. 'I think deep down every girl would love to be a model, but I just never ever thought I could do it. Now I am being told to sign up to modelling agencies. I can’t really believe it.' Breakfast: White toast with butter, biscuits and sugary cereal. Hot chocolate or Coca Cola to drink . Snack: Hot chocolate and a chocolate bar. Lunch: Mashed potato, chips and bread. Sticky toffee pudding and custard. Snack: Chocolate biscuits, crisps, bread. Supper: Mashed potato and vegetables, pasta in creamy cheese sauce. Muffin or a cream bun or cake and custard. Snack: Crisps, biscuits, hot chocolate . Breakfast: Cereal bar, fruit salad and fat free yoghurt. Coffee to drink. Snack: Grapes and raisins . Lunch: Cracker breads with Quorn ham,lettuce, tomato and cucumber salad, fruit salad for pudding. Snack: Apple . Supper: Big portion of broccoli, served with salad and grilled mushrooms.

"Manchester United might be concentrating on qualifying for the Champions League but captain Wayne Rooney and his team-mates have taken time out to discuss some other hot topics. The England international is joined in a quick-fire video to discuss goal of the season so far, Marouane Fellaini's famous lid and crucially, who is the worst-dressed player at the club.

Captain Rooney posed the questions for Fellaini and Phil Jones, joking he has scored the best goal of the season so far before all three unanimously chose Angel di Maria's delicate chip at Leicester in September. The video then cuts to the Argentine who talks us through the goal. 'I think the only option left for me was to chip it. A beautiful goal and I'm very happy,' said a very proud di Maria. Clearly the United dressing room pride themselves on their dress sense, with Rooney once again tongue in cheek voting for himself. Fellaini was quick to point the finger at fellow Belgian Adnan Januzaj as the worst offender. Di Maria runs away in his trademark celebration after his delightful chip at Leicester in September . The Argentine laughs away with Rojo discussing the dress sense of Fellaini . Di Maria scored this audacious chip during a 5-3 defeat at Leicester in September . Little does he know that team-mates Rojo and di Maria chose Fellaini as their worst dressed team-mate: 'Kind of bad huh? I'm not liking his style at all,' claimed the club record signing. Jones finally revealed the burning question in the Manchester United dressing room: 'Everyone wanted to know what is the diameter of Fellaini's hair.' So the England international grabbed a tape measure and found out the bouncy afro measures 28cm by 28cm before adding: 'It's nice hair though!'

"Where do the rich and famous stay when they're planning a getaway on the shores of Lake Geneva? Michael Jackson, Richard Branson, Rihanna and Bill Gates have all enjoyed stays here, the world's luxurious hotel suite - a snip at only £52,000 a night. The Royal Penthouse Suite of the President Wilson hotel in Geneva, Switzerland, is believed to be the most expensive hotel suite in the world. Surely you're not spending all this money just to watch TV? Nevertheless, the President Wilson hotel's Royal Penthouse Suite comes with an impressively sized Bang & Olufsen flat-screen to stare at . For the musical types: Pop stars Rihanna and Michael Jackson may have also run their fingers across the keys of the Steinway grand piano found i the Royal Penthouse Suite's second living room .

Occupying the entire eighth floor of the hotel and spanning a massive 18,000 sq/ft, it boasts panoramic views overlooking the Lake Geneva and the Alps as well as a built in gym and jacuzzi. Perfumes emanate from the wardrobes of the 12 bedrooms - each with an en-suite bathroom - and guests can either play billiards or have a tinkle on the Steinway grand piano for entertainment. And after a hard day seeing the sights of the the Swiss capital they can relax with the Bang & Olufsen BeoVision flat-screen TV and audio installation - or simply admire their sumptuous surroundings. A hotel spokesman said: 'No matter where one looks, an oeuvre d'art is for contemplation. Should it be an art deco vase; a prestigious painting, or a Persian carpet, each object has been chosen for its unique value.' But that's not all, the staggering price also includes a private butler, chef and security team, who are placed at the beck and call of guests, who in the past have included Hollywood stars like Matt Damon and Michael Douglas. Well appointed: The Royal Penthouse suite is sumptuously decorated in a traditional European style . One of many paintings hanging on the walls: 'No matter where one looks, an oeuvre d'art is for contemplation. Should it be an art deco vase; a prestigious painting, or a Persian carpet,' a hotel spokesman boasts . Security conscious: The entrance to the suite, which is guarded by surveillance cameras here and in the corridors, as well as steel lined entry doors, making it a firm favourite it a firm favourite with heads of state . Another relaxing spot: The royal living room of the suite, enjoyed by the likes of Prince Albert II of Monaco, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak...  and Tony Blair . A fine view: The balcony of the suite has a fine view at dusk, as this picture shows, and guests can also peer out at anything happening on Lake Geneva with the telescope made available for them . What really sets the Royal Penthouse suite apart is its range of tight security features that have made it a firm favourite with such heads of state as Prince Albert II of Monaco, former Soviet leader Gorbachev and Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak. Former British prime minister Tony Blair, now a jetsetting global diplomat and consultant to major investment banks, has also enjoyed a stay there.

This is where the magic happens... The Royal Penthouse Suite's roual bedroom, with its panoramic views of the magnificent Lake Geneva only interrupted by... another television . And this is where they get clean afterwards: The master bathroom, with its immense marble bath tub . Height of luxury: For those who regard the 'royal bedroom' as below them, here is the 'imperial bedroom' A lesser bathroom: Again with marble tub and with chilled bubbly on hand... but be careful drinking in the bath! There are also magnetic contacts outside the suite which can detect if there is an intrusion and the two main bedrooms have panic buttons which are linked to the hotel's security.

"Steve Jobs is remembered as one of the greatest minds of his generation - but during his lifetime, he was convinced that his achievements would be swiftly forgotten. In a newly unearthed interview, the Apple founder complained that because of the fast pace of technological innovation, his inventions became out-of-date within just a few years. 'All the work that I have done in my life will be obsolete by the time I'm 50,' Jobs said in the interview, recorded in 1994 when he was 39. Scroll down for video . Claim: Steve Jobs said in 1994 that he expected all of his life's work to be forgotten about . Pensive: The Apple founder compared himself to a layer of sediment contributing to the growth of a mountain . At the time of the interview, which was posted to YouTube this week, he had already turned Apple into one of the world's leading computer companies with inventions such as the Apple II and the Macintosh. In the years to come before his death in 2011, he would go on to launch revolutionary devices such as the iPod, iPhone and iPad. However, in 1994 he pointed out that technological breakthroughs were inherently fleeting, because they were inevitably overtaken by newer innovations. 'This is not a field where one paints a painting that will be looked at for centuries, or builds a church that will be admired for centuries,' he said. 'This is a field where one does one's work and then in 10 years it's obsolete - and really will not be usable within 10 or 20 years.' Pioneer: Jobs pictured in 1977 with the Apple II computer, one of his earliest major inventions . Prolific: Jobs in 2011, a few months before his death, presenting one of his trademark product launches . He went on to compare technological innovations to the formation of a mountain, with each individual's contribution quickly forgotten even if it has a lasting impact. 'It's sort of like sediment of rocks,' he said.' You're building up a mountain and you get to contribute your little layer of sedimentary rock to make the mountain that much higher. 'But no one on the surface, unless they have X-ray vision, will see your sediment. They'll stand on it. It'll be appreciated by that rare geologist.' The clip, posted online by EverySteveJobsVideo, is taken from an hour-long documentary called Steve Jobs: Visionary Entrepreneur, based around the newly discovered 1994 interview. Historic: Jobs produced iconic products from the Apple Macintosh, left, up to the iPad tablet computer, right . When Jobs died of cancer aged 56, the news was met with a global outpouring of grief as he was hailed as one of the defining figures in the history of technology. In his second stint as chief executive of the company he founded in a garage alongside Steve Wozniak, he revolutionised music and communications by launching the first popular MP3 player followed by the iPhone, the world's leading smartphone. He also helped change the way technology companies market themselves by opening the Apple stores to sell the firm's products directly, as well as the iTunes portal for downloading music online.","Apple founder pointed out that tech breakthroughs are quickly overtaken .

"England exile Kevin Pietersen has once again criticised his former international colleagues, suggesting he was the victim of professional jealousy. Pietersen was sacked by England almost a year ago, but has been on hand with regular barbs ever since a confidentiality agreement between the two parties expired. His explosive autobiography included many unhappy reflections on his international career, not to mention claims of a bullying dressing room culture. Kevin Pietersen has suggested he was the victim of professional jealousy while playing for England . Pietersen is currently playing for the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash over in Australia . Pietersen (pictured with Alastair Cook during the Ashes humiliation in 2013) cashed in on the IPL . Pietersen supposedly covets an unlikely Three Lions recall but in an interview with Australian media to preview Saturday's Big Bash derby between his Melbourne Stars and city rivals Melbourne Renegades, he again used the chance to settle scores with his former team-mates. He claimed his lucrative Indian Premier League contract caused resentment and he prefers playing in the BBL, where many players participate in franchise cricket in other countries. 'There's no jealousy here. That's the fact,' he said of life with the Stars. 'None of these guys are jealous of anything. We're just good guys, hanging out and playing cricket. All these guys play in franchises around the world, they've all benefited from the IPL. 'The England lads: too much jealousy. I was the only one profiting - very, very well - out of India, and in an auction, if you don't get picked up, it's pretty demoralising.' Pietersen (pictured fumbling a catch this week) asserts that the England players were jealous of him .","Kevin Pietersen suggested he was the victim of professional jealousy .

"The producers of hit BBC drama Sherlock are under pressure to fast-track new episodes in order to get the programme back on television in time for next Christmas. Following the success of the New Year's Day episode of Sherlock, which attracted over 13 million viewers when catch-up services are factored in, the BBC is understood to be eager to bill the programme as the main event in its Christmas 2014 schedule. The news comes after the BBC was rocked by a surge in people watching ITV over the festive period, with healthy numbers for both Downton Abbey and Coronation Street - the latter of which beat Eastenders' Christmas Day viewing figures for the first time in over a decade. Top billing: The New Year's Day episode of Sherlock attracted over 13 million viewers and the BBC is understood to be eager to bill the programme as the main event for Christmas 2014 . More than 10 million people are expected to have tuned in to last night's series three finale of Sherlock, which ended on a cliffhanger. The series began with the New Year's Day special after a two year wait, and was criticised in some quarters for failing to answer questions about how the world's most famous detective . faked his own death in the final episode of the previous series. Speaking to the Sun, a BBC insider said: 'The BBC is desperate for a Sherlock Christmas Day special this year. It wants its biggest guns ready.' Sherlock creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss have already admitted sketching out ideas for a fourth and fifth series, with the current story arc leaving the door open for new episodes. The long-awaited third series takes place two years after Sherlock was seen hurling himself from the roof of St Bart's Hospital, London, in an apparent suicide . All that is believed to be required for a Sherlock Christmas Day special to be confirmed is confirmation that its stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman can agree to start filming in spring. Earlier this week it was revealed that Sherlock now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time, overtaking the 2011 Downton Abbey Christmas special, which received 3.1 million views through ITV Player. The New Year's Day episode attracted over 10 million viewers during its initial broadcast, raising to 13 million when catch-up services are factored in. Although so-called 'cult' dramas such as Sherlock are incredibly popular and therefore naturally attract a large numbers of views, it is thought that their fans also tend to watch them during their initial broadcast, then re-watch one or more times through a catch-up service.","Hit drama is expected to be the BBC's main event for Christmas 2014 .

"The nationality of each passenger will make a staggering difference to the compensation payments made to the families of the 239 people killed in the crash of flight MH370, according to legal experts. Public liability lawyers say the biggest disparity will be the difference between the payouts offered to the relatives of western passengers, compared to those from Asian countries. American aviation crash attorney Floyd Wisner said passengers and crew from China, Malaysia and Indonesia would fare worse in their claims due to what they are calling a limited view of damages. 'They could evaluate these cases and say a Chinese life is (of) less value than an American life. That's unfair and that's going to cause problems,' he told CNBC. Scroll down for video . A hysterical family member of a passenger aboard MH370 reacts to the news of her loved one's death . Devastated: Jayden Burrows, supported by his aunt Kaylene Mann, pictured during a press conference on Tuesday, are among Australian relatives of those who died on MH370 . Under the multilateral Montreal Convention, relatives of air crash victims from signatory countries are entitled to about $US176,000 in damages without having to prove fault. Further claims can then be made in any one of five places: the primary residence of the plaintiff, the destination of the flight, where the ticket was bought, where the carrier is domiciled or its main place of business. But Mr Wisner warned any major disparity in payouts would lead to international uproar. 'I would be raising holy hell if I was a family member of a passenger from one country getting less than someone who happened to be sitting next to me from another country,' he said. The lawyer said the airline could pay between $500-750 million in damages to relatives it was probable it had liability insurance of about $1 billion. Danica Weeks' husband Paul was killed when the plane crashed in the southern Indian Ocean. The New Zealand couple were based in Perth, Western Australia . Terry Rolfe, the leader of American aviation practice Integro Insurance Brokers, said compensation for loss of life would be massively different for American victims and those from other countries, CNBC reported. Ms Rolfe estimated an American court would pay compensation of between $8-10 million per passenger, while Chinese relatives would likely receive less than $1 million per passenger. Most of the people on MH370 were Asian, but relatives are likely to get less compensation because of the legal system in the countries where they are seeking damages . In non-common law countries such as China, where 154 of the missing flight's 239 passengers were from, the payouts could be minimal due to a 'restrained view of damages', according to Australian public liability lawyer Barrie Woollacott. He said notions of loss in some Asian countries were viewed differently to the west, and this could restrict the way claims are dealt with and also the amount of compensation. 'The way it's administered is a matter for that country,' Mr Woollacott told the MailOnline. 'Non-common law countries have laws that provide different levels or scales for negligence, where as in Australia there is no cap,' he said. Experts say the disparity in compensation is influenced by a 'restrained view of damages' in non-common law countries throughout Asia . Mr Woollacott said in that in Australia, where six of the plane's passengers were from, if fault is alleged by the person bringing the claim, the airline must prove it was not negligent. And in those cases, those who suffered loss from an aviation disaster would be able to apply for unlimited compensation. 'If the plane wasn't found or if it didn't enable Malaysia Airlines to establish they weren't negligent, they would be exposed to large claims,' he said. But if an airline can prove it was not negligent then victims will only be entitled to what is outlined under the Montreal Convention. Brisbane couple Rodney and Mary Burrows, pictured, were among the Australians who were killed when MH370 plunged into a remote area of Indian Ocean . Allianz is the main reinsurer for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane and according to Reuters it has started paying claims in relation to the plane's disappearance. It has been reported that $US110 million has been placed in an escrow account and the insurance company settled to make hardship payments to the families of those lost. Malaysia Airlines said it will not consider compensation payouts until what happened aboard the flight is determined, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Authorities believe the plane turned back from its scheduled flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 and crashed into the southern Indian Ocean nearly eight hours later.","Compensation lawyers expect huge disparity in the payouts to the families of those on board MH370 .

'I believe that some colleges may potentially be afraid of having a bad reputation and that would be a reason it could be swept under the rug, because they don't want that to come out in public,' Sanchez said in reply. 'More awareness is very important so women can learn how to protect themselves,' she added.

"Tragedy: Grandfather Alan Catterall, 54, died after he got trapped in an industrial oven at work that was turned on by future son-in-law Mark Francis . A grandfather burned to death inside an industrial oven that baked plastic at up to 280 degrees after he became trapped and the machine was turned on by his future son-in-law, a court heard. Alan Catterall, 54, from Runcorn, Cheshire, had gone into the oven to fix a fault when operator Mark Francis, not realising he was still working inside, switched the machine on and locked him in. Mr Francis was engaged to Mr Catterall's eldest daughter, the jury was told. Liverpool Crown Court heard that because there was no alarm Mr Catterall tried to escape using a crowbar but because of the noisy working environment no one heard his cries for help. Colleagues at Pyranha Mouldings Ltd only discovered 'the problem was when smoke started seeping out of the oven,' the jury heard. The father-of-three died after suffering severe burns and shock following the incident on 23 December 2010. The company's oven was used to make kayaks. Pyranha is now on trial charged with corporate manslaughter with the directors and a self-employed engineer facing charges related to health and safety breaches. Andrew Thomas, QC, prosecuting, said: 'The circumstances of Mr Catterall's death are quite horrific. 'On the morning of the accident a fault had developed in one of the ovens and it was out of action for about an hour whilst repair work was carried out. 'The initial fault was fixed and one of the operators turned the machine back on. 'Tragically, what the operator did not realise was that Mr Catterall was still working inside the oven. 'The design of the oven was such that the moment it was switched on its power-operated doors shut and automatically locked with metal bolts on the outside. 'Mr Catterall was trapped within the oven. There was no means of escape and no alarm. 'The oven is lined with insulation material, and on the noisy factory floor, there was no chance of anyone hearing his cries for help. Court case: Directors at Pyranha Mouldings Ltd in Runcorn, Cheshire, and the oven's designer are on trial after Alan Catterall died there in 2010 . 'After a preparation cycle lasting several minutes, the burners were turned on and the oven was raised to operating temperature. 'The evidence indicates that Mr Catterall made efforts to escape using a metal crow bar, but it was to no avail. 'He suffered severe burns and died as a result of shock. The first anyone knew about the problem was when smoke started seeping out of the oven.' Mr Catterall grew up in Liverpool and worked at a tyre factory in Speke before joining the Ford factory in Halewood where he worked for many years. He joined Pyranha in 1997 and was promoted to team leader at the company - which had between 90 and 100 employees - where his wife Pearl and daughter also worked. The company managing director Graham Mackereth, 64, from Runcorn, his brother and technical director Peter Mackereth, 59, from Llangollen, Wales, and self-employed electrical engineer Paul Keddie, from Wales, who designed the ovens, all deny health and safety breaches.

"It's 50 years since the Jetsons first predicted we'd be flying the family about in airborne cars. And now we are finally standing on the cusp of that long-awaited milestone, as the world's first flying motorcycle goes on sale. The Pal-V One Helicycle is a two-seat hybrid car and gyrocopter that has the potential for making rush-hour delays a thing of the past. Scroll down for video . The Pal-V One - a three-wheeled motorcyle that transforms into a gyrocopter at the flick of a switch - is now on sale for $295,000 (£180,000). It takes 10 minutes to switch between modes and can go from 0 to 60 in the air in under 8 seconds . Luxury gadgets site Hammacher Schlemmer is marketing the Helicycle for 'just' $395,000 - a bargain... It is road - and air - legal and now, . two years after its maiden flight, it is finally available to buy - if . you have a spare $395,999 (£230,000) that is. The Dutch-built Pal-V One can reach speeds of up to 112mph and goes from 0 to 60 in under 8 seconds when driven on the road. The two-seater vehicle converts from a three-wheeled motorcycle to a gyrocopter in 10 minutes. It has 230hp, four-cylinder engine and reaches speeds of up 112 mph in the air or on the road. The helicycle goes from 0 to 60 mph in under eight seconds. The gyrocopter is designed to cruise at low altitudes (below 4,000ft) and it requires a 540ft runway for take-offs. For landing, the vehicle needs just 100 ft. The 27-gallon gas tank provides a 220-mile flight range (750 miles on the road). It is made from carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum and weighs 1,499lbs. Owners must have a Sports Pilot Certificate to fly the vehicle. Owners will need a Sports Pilot Certificate to fly one. The two-seater vehicle can be bought through luxury gadget retailer Hammacher Schemmler which advertises it under name The Helicycle, yet its design and specifications are identical to the Pal-V One's. Despite its helicopter-like appearance, like many flying car prototypes, including the TF-X from Austin-based Terrafugia, the Pal-V needs a 540ft runway in order to take-off. When in flight mode, the vehicle looks like a helicopter, however, it is known as a gyrocopter or autogyro because the main power comes . from the rotors at the rear of the vehicle. Its rotors spin considerably slower than a helicopter's blades, too, and can't stall. On . the ground, the machine handles somewhere between a motorbike and a . racing car - its chassis is built to lean into turns, and the two-seater . can reach speeds of up to 112mph. Unlike . most fictional flying cars, of course, it can't just extend its rotors . then hurtle skywards - the process takes about ten minutes. The Pal-V One, pictrured, needs a 540ft runway in order to take-off. When in flight mode, the vehicle looks like a helicopter, however, it is known as a gyrocopter or autogyro because the main power comes from the rotors at the rear of the vehicle . Once the engine stops, the propeller folds itself automatically into the driving position. Pushing a button then lowers the rotor mast into the horizontal position. Rotor blades and tail have to be stowed away by the driver. 'On the ground the vehicle drives like a sports car,' said Pal-V. 'Within minutes its rotor is unfolded and its tail is extended: then it is ready to take off thanks to the advanced gyrocopter technology.' The gyrocopter, pictured, is designed to cruise at low altitudes, below 4,000ft. Although it needs a 540ft runway for take-off, it only needs 100ft to land . The 27-gallon gas tank in the Pal-V One, pictured, provides a 220-mile flight range or 750 miles on the road. It is made from carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum and weighs 1,499lbs . The Pal-V One is on sale from retailer Hammacher Schemmler under the name The Helicycle - but the specifications are the same. It can reach speeds of up to 112 mph and tilts like a motorcycle when turning corners, left.  The helicycle goes from 0 to 60 mph in under eight seconds on the road, as well . 'With these successful test results it is proven that it is not only possible to build a flying car but also that it can be done within existing international rules for both flying and driving.' The Pal-V One features a 230hp, four-cylinder engine powered by petrol. Its 27 gallon tank means pilots can fly for up to 220 miles at low altitudes - around 4,000ft - or drive for up 750 miles. It is made of carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum and weighs 1,500lbs. The Pal-V One completed its maiden voyage just 18 months ago. It is available in red, pictured, or black .

"Few predictions are certain when it comes to the future of air travel ... except this one. It looks like being a lot more comfortable. A British company has come up with adjustable plane seats you can book to suit your shape and size. It means larger passengers need not worry about squeezing into uncomfortable, tight spaces, moving to business class or paying double – they just book an expanded seat to fit them. And families can enjoy more comfortable flights without taking up more overall space – mothers and fathers can add a few notches to their seats while smaller children can have theirs scaled down. The Morph, as the seat has been called,  also allows for the possibility of slimmer travellers paying less for occupying smaller spaces. The design by London firm Seymourpowell has already attracted attention from plane manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus. Details of passengers' sizes and needs will be fed into a computer and airline staff then adjust the varied seating arrangements at a touch of a button before take-off. Morph works by replacing the traditional foam pads used in airline seats with a fabric that is stretched across the width of three seats, around a frame and over formers, a little like a hi-tech hammock. It promises comfort without reducing leg room . Unlike traditional seats, which are created individually using foam padding, the new design is based around a single piece of fabric stretched across the back of a frame for three seats. Another piece of fabric is placed along the bottom, creating a hammock-style chair. The frame includes ‘formers’ which move up or down underneath the fabric, allowing the passenger to alter the recline, as well as the height and depth of the seat pan, according to their size and comfort. Crucially, the formers, which act as arm rests and dividers between the three seats, can also be moved left or right to alter their width, making the seats bigger or smaller. Economy class airline seats are, on average, around 18in wide. Squeezing into a small airline seat could become a thing of the past, but larger people might have to pay more for their airline seat if the new Morph concept becomes a reality . But the Morph seats would allow, for example, a couple travelling with a young child to book two larger 22in seats to improve their comfort, while the child would occupy a smaller and cheaper 10in seat. Jeremy White, of Seymourpowell, admitted that some airlines were resistant to charging people according to their size, but claimed passengers would welcome improved choice. Larger travellers could see it as a better option than being charged twice over. ‘One airline told us that if they have an oversized passenger, they make them buy two seats,’ he said. ‘I can’t think of anything more degrading or humiliating than forcing someone to buy two seats because they are a bit wide.’ The seats can be reclined and adjusted to suit an individual's preferred seated position by moving the seat 'formers', which in turn morphs the fabric to provide a 'tailored fit and greater comfort,' according to the firm . Mr White said the seats can also be adjusted to suit other needs such as privacy for lone travellers,  mothers with children, people working or less abled passengers. The seats are unlikely to be fitted into existing aircraft, so it could be more than a decade before the Morph design is introduced. However, some airlines have already adopted similar seating plans. Air New Zealand’s Dreamliners feature ‘Skycouches’, a row of three economy seats that can be turned into a sofa. And earlier this year Airbus announced it would be offering an additional two inches on some aisle seats on its new A320 jets to keep up with ‘demographic trends’.

"Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, has tried to win over a sceptical public claiming the crops are safe . Eighty-five scientists have joined forces to challenge the claims of biotech giants and the UK government that GM food is safe for humans. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who has responsibility for food and farming, and the industry have embarked on a huge public relations exercise to win over a sceptical public to genetically modified food. The campaign is built on an assurance that the food is safe to eat and could defeat a host of ills from malnutrition in the Third World to blindness in children. GM supporters also insist crops are safe for the environment and to be used as animal feed. However, these assurances have been questioned by the scientists, who warn there is a serious lack of independent research into the health effects of GM food. Studies involving feeding trials with animals suggest eating GM food could cause real harm, such as allergies, inflammation of internal organs and even breast cancer. The group has signed a joint statement which concludes: ‘The claimed consensus on GM organism safety does not exist.’ They warn that most of the positive . research has been run and paid for by biotech companies such as . Monsanto, which have invested millions in trying to get the world to eat . their crops. Professor . Brian Wynne, of Lancaster University, said: ‘There is no consensus . amongst scientific researchers over the health or environmental safety . of GM crops and foods, and it is misleading and irresponsible for anyone . to claim that there is. Greenpeace protesters attacking a field of genetically modified crops which scientists warn are not safe for humans to eat . ‘Many salient questions remain open, while more are being discovered and reported by independent scientists.’ Mr Paterson has often cited the situation in the US as evidence that GM causes no health risk. He argues that the fact people have been eating these foods for almost 20 years demonstrates they are safe and last week he dismissed opponents as ‘wicked’.","Scientists join forces to challenge claims genetically modified food is safe for humans .

"The U.S. should adapt to a European model in the workplace in order to halt global warming, a study says. By working less hours per week and take longer vacations the American people could reduce carbon emissions, think tank Center for Economic Policy and Research claim. If the ‘Western European’ working model was to be adopted in the U.S., it could reduce up to 50 per cent of the addressable global temperature rise expected by 2100. Time off for the climate: American can help fight climate change by taking on the 'European model' of working less hours per week . There is a documented link between a shorter work week and lower levels of carbon emissions, which is at the centre of the research by the Washington think tank. As productivity grows in western civilisations, as well as developing countries, the study analyses the gains from the resulting increase in consumption versus the possible loss as a result of fewer working hours. It concludes that a developing country expanding at a high rate should chose the ‘European’ model in order to keep greenhouse emissions at bay. It adds that an American switch to the 'European' system could have a significant impact on global warming. The research paper estimates that a change could ‘eliminate about one-quarter to one-half’ of global warming which is not already in the atmosphere, and would have particular effect if adapted by workplaces that consume high levels of energy, such as factories. Green time: By taking more vacations, American families can help the environment (file photo) Travelling time: The reduction in emissions would mainly derive from lowering the productivity in workplaces which use a lot of energy, such as in factories, but also by less commuting . ‘The relationship between [shorter work and lower emissions] is complex and not clearly understood, but it is understandable that lowering levels of consumption, holding everything else constant, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions,’ the study’s author, economist David Rosnick, writes. He concludes that some climate change is inevitable, but adds that the amount of which is ‘very much under our control’. ‘In addition to reducing emissions by other means, a significant reduction in climate change is possible by choosing a more European response to productivity gains rather than following a model more like that of the United States.’ In the ‘best case scenario’ Americans would begin working about 0.5 per cent less each year, starting with a 10-hour reduction in 2013, which could prevent an increase of up to 1.3 degrees. ‘We can get a similar amount of work done as productivity and technology improves,’ Rosnick says. ‘It's something we have to decide as a country—there are economic models in which individuals get to decide their hours and are still similarly productive as they are now.’ However the study does not take into consideration what people would do with the increased leisure time, and although it says fewer working hours will help, it could be cancelled out if it would mean an increase in holidays with extensive travelling.","Shorter hours and more vacations could help the environment .

"New research has shown a correlation between the rise of the Internet and the decline of Americans claiming religious affiliation. Other factors, such as an increase in higher education, are also implicated, but according to Allen Downey, a computer scientist at the Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, the increase in Internet usage has a significant correlation. The MIT Technology Review reports that in 1990, eight per cent of Americans had no religious affiliation. In 2010, that figure stands at 18 per cent, or 25 million people. Religious figures: Downey says that increased Internet usage correlates to about 25 per cent of the drop in religiosity . Downey analyzed data from the General . Social Survey, a well-respected annual research survey carried out by . the University of Chicago, to make his findings. Downey . says the single biggest cause of religious affiliation is upbringing: . those you are raised in religious households are much more likely to . remain in their family's religion as adults. However, . since 1990, the number of people who had relgious upbringings has . fallen, leading to a decrease in religious individuals - but Downey says . that can only account for 25 per cent of the drop. Higher education at the college level is also correlated with the drop in religion, but although the number of people receiving a college education has increased 10 per cent since the 1980s, Downey says it only accounts for a five per cent drop. Crossed off: About 25 million fewer Americans have religious affiliations today than back in 1990 . By far the largest factor, says Downey, is Internet use. In the 1980s, Internet use was virtually non-existent, but in 2010, 53 per cent of people spent two hours online a week and 25 per cent spent more than seven hours. Downey is careful to note that his research has revealed a correlation and not a causation. A relationship between the rise of the Internet and the drop in religion exists, but one is not directly responsible for the other. Downey says that his research has controlled for 'most of the obvious candidates, including income, education, socioeconomic status, and rural/urban environments' to discount a third factor, one that is responsible both for the rise of Internet use and the drop in religiosity. However, that still leaves a 45 per cent drop in religious affiliation that is unaccounted for. 'About half of the observed change remains unexplained,' Downey told the MIT Technology Review.","New research shows that the number of Americans with religious affiliations has dropped by 18 per cent, or 25 million people .

"Thousands of armed vigilantes have taken over a town in Mexico and arrested police officers after their 'commander' was killed and dumped in the street. The self described 'community police' and arrested 12 officers and the town's former director of public . security, who they accuse of taking part in the killing of Guadalupe Quinones Carbajal, 28, on behalf of a local organised . crime group. The 1,500-strong force has also set up improvised checkpoints on the major road running through Tierra Colorado, which connects the capital Mexico City to Acapulco, a coastal city popular with tourists less than 40 miles away. Scroll down for video . Takeover: A group of around 1,500 armed vigilantes have seized control of Tierra Colorado in Mexico this week . Checkpoints: The 'community police' have been stopping traffic on a main road to the capital Mexico City . A tourist heading to the beach with relatives for the Easter weekend was injured on Tuesday after the vigilantes opened fire on his car because he refused to stop at a roadblock. The takeover comes amid a growing movement of 'self defence' groups in the region, which claim to be fighting against drug cartels. The town is home to around 20,000 people and at least 2,000 civilians are thought to have fled. The Tierra Colorado vigilantes have also been searching people's homes and are reported to have seized drugs from some properties. Growing movement: The group is one of many 'self-defence' forces which claim to be fighting organised crime . Major route: Tierra Colorada is in the southern state of Guerrero on the way from Mexico City to Acapulco . The arrested former security official . and police officers have been handed over to state prosecutors, who . agreed to investigate their alleged links to organised crime. Many of the vigilantes are carrying . high-powered assault rifles, which may have been seized from the former . security director's car. The group's 'commander' Carbajal's body had been found dumped in the street in a nearby town on Monday. The force's spokesman, Bruno Placido Valerio, said: 'We have besieged the municipality, because here criminals operate with impunity in broad daylight, in view of municipal authorities. Holiday destination: Tierra Colorado is on a major road to Acapulco, a city popular with tourists 35 miles away . 'Self-defence': Armed residents take part in the March for Justice in Ayutla de los Libres earlier this month .

Escudero,police chief of the municipality. Self-appointed protection: Hundreds of members of a 'community police force' march through Ayutla de los Libres this month . The vigilantes are part of regional umbrella group Union of Peoples and Organizations of Guerrero State. The . Union is made up of residents in Tierra Colorado, as well as . neighbouring towns such as Ayutla de los Libres, Teconoapa and San . Marcos. The growing vigilante movement in southern and western Mexico has seen masked groups manning . checkpoints and searching vehicles for weapons. They have also been searching for . those named on a hand-written list of people suspected of crimes . including theft and extortion. In . February, a pair of tourists from Mexico City were wounded on their way . to the beach when they were shot at after refusing to stop at one of . the roadblocks. The . vigilantes claim they are fighting violence, kidnap and extortion by . drug cartels - but there are fears that the groups are violating human . rights of those they detain and cooperating with criminals. The state itself is home to some of the poorest rural communities in the country and last year had Mexico's highest murder rate -with 90 per cent of crimes reported as going unsolved or not even investigated. It has been the scene of bloody fighting between rival drugs gangs bidding for control of the lucrative smuggling routes around the Pacific coast. Taking up arms: Vigilantes wearing balaclavas man a roadblock in Ayutla earlier this year . Justice: Kidnapping suspects are escorted by an armed vigilante group in Ayutla in January .

In January, hundreds of armed vigilantes made a series of arrests and imposed curfews in Ayutla de los Libres and Teconoap. They also manned checkpoints and claimed they had arrested at least 30 suspected criminals. One of the masked vigilantes said: 'They kill, extort, rape.

"An Austrian woman who was raped in Dubai has been arrested for having extra martial sex and was told by police she could only avoid jail if she married her attacker. The 29-year-old student from Vienna was facing a jail sentence having been accused of having sex outside of marriage and drinking alcohol, both of which are illegal in the United Arab Emirate capital. It was only after the Austrian Foreign Ministry intervened, that she was able to leave the country and return home. A view of Dubai skyscrapers. The woman claimed she was raped by a man in an underground car park one of the major cities of the United Arab Emirates . The unnamed woman, who is understood to be Muslim, had been to a party at a hotel where the rules on alcohol are often lax, according to Austrian officials. She said the attack happened in an underground car park after a Yemeni man in Dubai approached her. When she reported it to police, she was arrested and told she could only escape being charged if she agreed to marry the man she said had attacked her. The student was released after a special crisis team was sent by the Austrian Foreign Ministry to Dubai to negotiate with the authorities. She was greeted by Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz when she landed in Vienna yesterday. An online petition also helped to bring attention to the situation, gaining over 260,000 signatures calling for her release in just a few days. Her quick release came as a surprise because, as a Muslim, she would likely have been treated more severely than non-Muslim Western visitors in trouble with police because of the strict Islamic rules surrounding drinking. The woman, a student, was eventually flown back to Vienna following an online petition. People believe that her treatment might have been because she was Muslim, and that she would have been subject to the strict Islamic laws regarding drinking . Her case has been compared the eventual pardon of a 24-year-old Norwegian woman who was given a prison sentence of one year and four months by a Dubai court after she reported her own rape last year. Instead of being treated as a victim, she was found guilty of alcohol abuse and extramarital sex. She was later pardoned and allowed to return to Norway after there was a global outcry about her treatment.

"A gambler who is suing Britain’s oldest casino for withholding his £7.8 million payout has admitted  he did win the cash by ‘reading’  the cards. Phil Ivey, dubbed the Tiger Woods of poker, says he used a legitimate technique called ‘edge sorting’ to identify cards during a game of punto banco, a type of baccarat based purely on luck. But he vehemently denies cheating. However, Mayfair club Crockfords believes he ‘operated a scam’ and claims he ‘acted to defeat the essential premise of the game’ – and is refusing to hand over his winnings. 'The Tiger Woods of poker': Professional gambler . Phil Ivey is suing Britain's oldest casino for withholding his . £7.8million payout, despite admitting that he did win by 'reading' the . cards using a controversial technique . Mr Ivey – a professional American  poker player – is suing the casino in the High Court and the case, the biggest legal battle in casino history, is due to be heard later this year. In May, The Mail on Sunday  reported details of Mr Ivey’s win – and revealed that the casino had not paid out because it believed he had been reading the cards. In his court submission – seen by The Mail  on Sunday – multi-millionaire Mr Ivey, 37 admits to being an ‘advantage player’ – someone who uses legal ways to gain a mathematical advantage over the casino.Playing punto banco over two nights in . August last year, Mr Ivey says he was able to exploit tiny flaws in the . design of the cards – asymmetrical pattern differences on the rear that . are the result of mistakes made during the manufacturing process. The Mail On Sunday's report in May . At odds: Mayfair club Crockfords withheld the cash claiming Mr Ivey 'operated a scam' that 'acted to defeat the essential premise of the game' It was well known in the industry around this time, according to Mr Ivey’s claim, that players might be able to use imperfectly cut cards to their advantage. Because of this, the claim adds, the casino should have thoroughly checked them before use. On his visit to Crockfords, Mr Ivey was accompanied by a Chinese associate known as Kelly, who was adept at ‘identifying the design flaws’. Mr Ivey’s claim says: ‘During the second session on August 20 [Mr Ivey] made various requests for decks of cards to be changed at the end of hands with which [Crockfords] chose to comply. This continued until Kelly identified a deck or decks of cards where the pattern on the reverse side of the cards was asymmetrical (in that one “long’’ side was different from the opposite side).’ Outlining how the pair managed to ‘edge sort’ the deck, the claim says: ‘Kelly would ask the dealer to reveal each card in turn by lifting the edge furthest from the dealer so that Kelly could identify whether the card was a seven, eight, or nine – the key cards in punto banco. The first time that Kelly identified a key card, she told the dealer that it was a 'good' card which she wanted the dealer to rotate in the opposite direction to all the other cards and the dealer complied with the request. ‘In this way, the long edges of the key card became distinguishable from those of the other cards.’ Over the course of time, ‘the cards in the deck were increasingly orientated so that “good” and “bad” cards faced in the opposite direction’. This meant that Mr Ivey was later able to recognise the key cards and bet accordingly. Initially, he was betting £50,000 a hand but, having edge sorted the cards, he asked the casino’s permission to raise the maximum stake to £150,000. Mr Ivey maintains in his claim that Crockfords’ owners were well aware how edge sorting worked and only have themselves to blame. He says that casinos frequently accede to advantage players’ special requests because they do not want to deter them from playing. Crockfords, the oldest private gaming club in the world, initially agreed to transfer Mr Ivey’s winnings to his bank account, but has returned only his £1million stake. The casino is owned by Genting, a Malaysian gaming corporation, which sent investigators to London to question employees and scrutinise hours of CCTV footage.","Mayfair club Crockfords claims Phil Ivey 'operated a scam' to win the game .

"A Texas father who discovered a man raping his five-year-old daughter and beat him to death with his bare hands will not be charged with homicide under state law. A Lavaca County grand jury decided not to press charges against the 23-year-old father in the June 9th death of Jesus Mora Flores, 47, who was killed inside a remote shack after he was caught molesting the young girl. Under Texas state law, deadly force is authorized and indeed, justified in order to stop an aggravated sexual assault and coupled with the fact that the harrowing 911 calls made by the father back claims he even tried to save the pedophile's life led to the grand jury's decision. Lavaca County sheriff's deputies said that the father, whose name has not been released to protect the little girl's identity, sent her and her brother to feed the family's chickens. The boy rushed back to tell his dad that someone had grabbed his sister and taken her to a small secluded shack and the father rushed towards his daughter's screams and arrived to find them both with their underwear off. Scroll Down for Video . No Charges: 25th Judicial District Attorney Heather McMinn, left, and Lavaca County Sheriff Mica Harmon appear at a news conference in Halletsville, Texas on Tuesday, June 19, 2012 in the aftermath of the killing . Flying into a rage, the father beat Flores unconscious, but attempted to call 911 for the rapist after he had made sure his daughter was safe. Sheriff Micah Harmon had said in June that he was not willing to press charges against the father, rather the case would be presented to a grand jury. At the time, Harmon said that the man was 'very remorseful' and didn't know at the time he had killed Flores. 'You have a right to defend your daughter,' Harmon told CNN at the time. 'The girl's father acted in defense of his third person. Once the investigation is completed we will submit it to the district attorney who then submits it to the grand jury, who will decide if they will indict him.' Indeed, the father is heard profanely screaming at a dispatcher who couldn't locate the property. Becoming increasingly frazzled, the father at one point tells the dispatcher he's going to put the man in his truck and drive him to a hospital before sheriff's deputies finally arrive. V'Anne Huser, the father's attorney, sternly told reporters several times during a news conference at the Lavaca County courthouse that neither the father nor the family will ever give interviews. 'He's a peaceable soul,' Huser said. 'He had no intention to kill anybody that day.' The attack happened on the family's ranch off a quiet, two-lane county road between the farming towns of Shiner and Yoakum. Decision: Heather McMinn, district attorney for Guadalupe, Gonzales and Lavaca Counties, speaks at a news conference with Lavaca County Sheriff Micah Harmon, second from right, and V'anne Huger, right, attorney for the father, in June . Authorities say a witness saw Flores 'forcibly carrying' the girl into a secluded area and then scrambled to find the father. Running toward his daughter's screams, investigators said, the father pulled Flores off his child and 'inflicted several blows to the man's head and neck area.' Emergency crews found Flores' pants and underwear pulled down on his lifeless body by the time they responded to the 911 call. The girl was taken to a hospital and examined, and authorities say forensic evidence and witness accounts corroborated the father's story that his daughter was being sexually molested. 'Under the law in the state of Texas deadly force is authorized and justified in order to stop an aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault,' District Attorney Heather McMinn told reporters in June. Horror: This photo shows a building near Shiner, Texas, where authorities say a Texas father beat to death with his fists a man molesting his 5-year-old daughter on June 9th . 'All the evidence provided by the sheriff's department and the Texas Rangers indicated that's what was occurring when the victim's father arrived at the scene,' she said. Authorities said he expressed regret at the killing at the time, and no evidence so far has led them to doubt his story. The girl's grandfather agreed it had been an accident. 'My son. Sorry,' the grandfather told the Victoria Advocate in broken English. 'It was an accident.' Lavaca County Sheriff Micah Harmon added: 'He was very remorseful. I don't think it was his intent for the man to die.' Defense attorney L'Anne Huser speaks to the media during a news conference held by 25th Judicial District Attorney Heather McMinn and Lavaca County Sheriff Mica Harmon in Halletsville, Texas . Residents of the small Lavaca County town were largely in support of the father, saying the victim deserved it. Sonny Jaehne, a Shiner native, told the Victoria Advocate: 'He got what he deserved, big time. Friend Mark Harabis reiterated this: 'I agree with him totally. I would probably do worse. 'The family will have to deal with that the rest of their lives, no matter what happens to the father. Even if they let him go, he and his child will have to deal with that the rest of their lives.'","A young father who beat his daughter's rapist to death after walking in on the assault will not face charges according to the states grand jury .

"The father who beat a man he allegedly caught performing a sex act on his 11-year-old son has admitted that it was only his son's pleas which stopped him from killing the admitted pervert. Jason Browning said he was going to stab Raymond Frolander, 18, to death after he beat him unconscious but that his son stood up and stopped him from killing the man. Frolander later admitted to Florida police that he has been molesting the boy for three years. 'I was going to kill him': Jason Browning says his son saved the life of a man who had been molesting the 11-year-old since he was just eight . 'My son is the one who stepped in front . of me and stopped me. My son saved his attackers life, so who's really . the hero in this situation?' the father asked WKMG outside the Daytona beach courthouse shortly after Frolander's first court appearance. Browning admitted he 'just snapped' when he walked in on Frolander naked with his son. Shortly after beating the teen into a coma, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife, he said. 'I was going to kill him,' said Browning. Frolander was considered family by the Brownings and often spent time with the 11-year-old boy, the father said. 'There was nothing uncommon to let the kids go in the bedroom and play video games together and now I have to wonder why the door was shut,' Mr Browning said. The father's outrage comes from being molested himself as a child at a foster home in California. He said beating Frolander was the easy part and much harder days lie ahead. 'I'm not going to pressure anything on him,' Mr Browning said. 'I know exactly what he's going through, when he's ready to talk about it, he will.' Police defended Mr Browning's actions but later criticized him for creating a Gofundme page asking for $1million in donations. Initially entitled 'Rebuilding Innocence', the fundraising page featured a picture of a sleeping boy and linked the site to his Facebook profile, according to News-Journal Online. Mr Browning wrote: 'We are reaching out to anyone that can help. Our son was sexualy (sic) assaulted and we are now faced with the challenge of picking up the pieces, the emotional and financial burden is about more than we can endure.. Please.. Anything helps.. God bless and be with you all.' Father and son: Browning and his 11-year-old son, who police said Frolander admitted to molesting for three years before the father pummeled him and called 911 to ask for an ambulance . By Monday evening, $145 had been . donated but the picture of the sleeping boy was removed. The headline . became 'Help Restore My Son’s Innocence' and the amount of money being . asked for dropped to $100,000. The Gofundme page appeared to have been taken down from the charity site by Tuesday. Police Chief Mike Chitwood said he was sad to learn of the father's attempt to make money out of the situation. He told MailOnline on Tuesday: 'It was brought to my attention and I have to say I was pretty shocked. 'The police, investigators and prosecutors go to great lengths to protect victims of sexual abuse. I'm sure his [Mr Browning's] intentions are in the right place but this is not good for the young man's recovery.' Chief Chitwood also said that he had hundreds of emails relating to the case, many from victims of sexual abuse and their families. He said: 'Many of them said that they wished someone - a father, mother, big brother - had walked in when it was happening to them.' Beaten down: Raymond Frolander was barely recognizable in his first court appearance after the savage pounding . Raymond . Frolander, 18, was treated at hospital before being taken to the . closest police station, and his still-swollen face was evident from the beating he received only days ago. Frolander, still covered in bruises and with a swollen face, pleaded not guilty to sexual battery on a child after he admitted to . molesting the boy for years. The father has not been charged with a crime and police appeared to understand his reaction. 'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood told WFTS. 'You have an 18-year-old who has clearly picked his target, groomed his target and had sex with the victim multiple times.' A subsequent mugshot showed that . Frolander had been badly beaten around the face, leaving him with . swollen lips and eyes, bruising and lacerations. Raymond Frolander, 18, (pictured in his mugshot) was beaten to a pulp by the father of the 11-year-old boy that he allegedly caught his sexually assaulting at a home in Daytona Beach, Florida . When the 911 responder asked the father if any weapons were involved, he said: 'My foot and my fist'. The 35-year-old man, who has not been identified, told a 911 dispatcher in the early hours of Friday: 'I just walked in on a grown man . molesting [name redacted]. And I got him in a . bloody puddle for you right now, officer.' Police arrived at the Daytona Beach home in Florida to find Frolander unconscious. 'He is nice and knocked out on the floor for you, I dragged him into the living room,' the father said. 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one.' The dispatcher asked: 'Is he still unconscious?' to which the father responds: 'Yes... I hit hard, sir.' He said that Frolander was a 'damn lucky boy that I love my God'. The father added: 'He stood up and his pants were around his ankles and nothing else needed to be said. I did whatever I got a right to do except I didn’t kill him.' The father had left his home around 1am to pick up some food and when he returned, heard a strange noise coming from the bedroom, police said. He pushed open the door and allegedly found Frolander with his pants down performing a sex act on the child. Frolander, 18, admitted to the abuse on the 11-year-old, according to his arrest affidavit. He is being held without bail on charges of sexual battery . The boy told investigators he had been playing video games with friends but when they left, Frolander took him to a back room and pulled down his pants. He also said Frolander had been abusing him for three years. Daytona Beach police chief Michael . Chitwood told MailOnline today that Frolander had a close family . connection to the alleged victim. Today the chief said he believed that Frolander lived next door to the boy and his father. The suspect was living with the victim's biological mother. Frolander's stepmother is also engaged to the victim's father. The police chief said the young boy was intimidated and told by Frolander that terrible things would happen if he revealed the abuse. Chief Chitwood said: 'He's 11 years old, he should be running around outside and playing video games, not dealing with something like this.' The father was not charged in the suspect’s beating, police spokesman Jimmie Flynt said. Frolander was taken to Halifax Heath Medical Center where he was treated for his injuries. The arrest affidavit said that Frolander admitted the abuse. The teen was charged with sexual battery on a child under 12 and is being held without bail. It was not known whether he's hired a lawyer.","Jason Browning, 35, shockingly admits he would have killed Raymond Frolander, 18, if not for his son stopping him .

Amid the hysteria the volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange blew up to an intra-day high of 3.06 million. The alarming message by the AP appeared retweeted at least 1,181 times before its deletion. Both the DOW Jones and the S&P regained their previous levels following word of the news agency's hacking minutes later. An editor with the AP wrote: 'Please ignore AP tweet on explosions, we've been hacked.' 'The President is fine, I was just with him,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also told the media.

'He did not know what I was talking about,' Corpina, who's a senior managing partner with Meridian Equity Partners Inc. told Bloomberg Radio. 'He said I’m staring at the White House and there’s nothing going on here right now.'

"A Youtube diet 'guru' from Australia puts her ultra-slim body down to an extreme diet, which can see her eat nothing but bananas for an entire day. Known as 'Freelee the Banana Girl' she advocates an extreme, low processed, low-fat, high-carb raw vegan diet. It's a regime that recently came under fire when fellow Australian  Loni Jane Anthony announced she had kept up the diet throughout her pregnancy, insisting that both she and her baby suffered no ill-effects. Consuming between 2000 and 5000 calories a day,  Freelee remains ‘raw until four’ - meaning she eats no cooked or heated food whatsoever until 4pm. She usually eats 'mono meals' consisting of a huge amount of a single fruit, such as two entire pinapples, five mangoes, two litres of orange juice, 1.4kg of apricots, or 20 bananas. Scroll down for video . Freelee the Banana Girl advocates her raw high-carb vegan diet through her YouTube channel and website . Freelee the Banana Girl sits admits a sea of bananas, dates, oranges and other fruits . Freelee thinks nothing of eating five mangoes or two whole pineapples in one sitting . Often appearing in her videos in bikinis and bearing her washboard stomach, Freelee shows fans how to eat 'Raw until Four' After 4pm she will often eat a cooked meal, again, usually a single ingredient in large qualities, such as 3.5kgs of potato baked in the oven, or another meal of fruit. Having suffered from both anorexia and bulimia in the past, Freelee claims that adopting her low fat, high carbohydrate, raw, vegan diet saw her shed 40lb or 2st 12lb as well as clearing up her acne, chronic fatigue syndrome, low thyroid function and terrible digestion. Often receiving negative comments for being too thin, Freelee, who also writes about her diet on her website, has nonetheless gained 166,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel preaching the benefits of her lifestyle.

Freelee is so passionate about her way of life she has even authored an Ebook on how to follow her diet, as well as her Facebook page, website, blog and YouTube channel. However several dieticians have spoken out about the dangers of cutting entire food groups out of your diet, and one aspect of Freelee’s lifestyle in particular, her excessive consumption of bananas, raises real concern. Eating 30 bananas a day on a regular basis, Freelee has posted a video to prove to those who doubted her that she can eat up to 50 bananas in a single day. Freelee has posted a video to prove to those who doubted her claim that she can eat up to 50 bananas in a single day . Freelee blends up to 20 bananas at once in order to ingests the high qualities . Freelee claims that except some initial bloating directly after each smoothie (pictured), her stomach remains totally flat throughout the day . In the video breakfast consists of 20 . bananas in a smoothie with coconut water and vanilla drops, which adds . up to around 2,000 calories. Freelee . follows this with a ‘lunch’ of 10 bananas, again pulsed into a smoothie . with coconut water, and a dinner of another 20-banana smoothie. In total, Freelee consumes 51 bananas in the video tutorial. Totaling about 5,000 calories, Freelee claims that, apart from some initial bloating . directly after each smoothie, her stomach remains totally flat . throughout the rest of the day. Freelee says: ‘You don’t have to eat this many bananas - I’m just trying to show you that you have to eat big to be lean. 'There are so many people out there saying restrict your calories to lose weight but it’s not true. ‘You need to smash in the carb calories. And that’s why I do videos like this; to show people. ‘I’m a lean bean; skinny arms and stomach, everything is lean on me and I never restrict my calories.

I’m fit and I’m healthy and these are results that come with time from this lifestyle but you’ve got to carb up!’ Bananas are very high in potassium, a mineral essential for survival but which the body, especially the heart, is particularly sensitive to. A single medium banana contains an average of 422mg of potassium, and while it would be nearly impossible to cause a cardiac arrest through consuming food, eating excessive levels can put a strain on the kidneys, which have to filter out the excess. British Dietetic Association spokesperson, Aisling Pigott says: ‘This interesting and alternative diet advocated by the Banana Girl appears to have helped the lady that promotes the diet, however conflicts with traditional healthy eating advice which recommends variety, portion control and moderation. Often garnering comments for being too thin, Freelee has nonetheless have gained 166 thousand subscribers on her YouTube channel preaching the benefits of her lifestyle . Freelee captioned this picture on her Instagram account: 'Seven years of eating 90% more of my calories from fruit and more fruit than any other female on the planet, averaging between 2,500 and 3,500 calories a day. Judge by results vs theory folks because the proof is in the banana pudding' ‘There are some benefits to the diet. For example, a well-balanced vegan diet can be extremely healthy if managed correctly, however all vegans should pay particular attention to their iron and calcium intake in addition to a Vitamin B12 supplement. ‘Raw fruit and vegetables retain more vitamins and minerals than cooked fruit and vegetables and . Controversial Instagram sensation Loni Jane Anthony hit headlines recently when she boasted she's 'living proof that you don’t have to become a whale when you’re pregnant'.  The Australian social media star first came under fire six months into her pregnancy, when she claimed she would continue her plant-based diet - which involved eating 20 bananas a day - throughout pregnancy. She says her diet has kept her in 'good shape'. ‘The Banana Girl promotes home cooked food and including less processed food as per traditional healthy eating advice . ‘However, the negative points of this diet are quite concerning. This diet contains no food sources of vitamin B12, limited calcium and little iron . ‘Poor intake of vitamin B12 and Iron over an extended time can  lead to vitamin B12 and Iron deficiency anaemia characterised by tiredness, upset stomach, poor skin colour and easy bruising . ‘Poor intake of calcium over a long time leads to low bone mineral density and brittle bones. ‘There is no element of portion control incorporated into these recommendations and based on scientific evidence and research, this is unlikely to lead to any weight loss if foods are consumed in the quantities recommended. ‘A small amount of fat is required for optimal health due to fat soluble, this diet recommends 10 per cent of calories coming from fat (38g/fat/day) which may not be sufficient to meet the needs of all individuals. ‘The sugar and carbohydrate content of this diet is extremely high. A high sugar and carbohydrate diet is linked with poor dental health and poor blood sugar control in those with diabetes or at risk of diabetes . ‘Eating large amounts of one food - for example bananas - can displace essential nutrients available from other foods . ‘In summary, I would always encourage my clients to include more raw fruit and vegetables in their diet, aiming for a variety of raw and cooked fruit and vegetables alongside a healthy balanced diet of portion controlled (about the size of your fist at each meal) starchy carbohydrates (such as bread, rice, potato, pasta) and protein (meat, eggs, beans or pulses) with two to three portions of calcium enriched foods/day (dairy or dairy alternatives) and limited fat, sugar and processed foods.’","Freelee the Banana Girl broadcasts diet from YouTube channel and website .

"Acute pain: Sarah Bignell contracted Lyme disease whilst on a walking holiday in the Scottish Highlands . When Sarah Bignell developed pain in her hands and wrists in autumn 2011, she thought she might be developing arthritis that was being aggravated by the cold. In fact, Sarah, 37, who is a vet, was displaying the first signs of a disease picked up on her summer holidays - in the UK - and her case was so severe that she ended up in a wheelchair, unable to work. 'The stabbing, burning pain became excruciating quite quickly, spreading to my toes, knees, back, jaw, neck and shoulders and then shooting down my limbs,' recalls Sarah. 'It was intermittent, but the worst pain I've ever experienced - there were occasions when I thought I'd black out.' She also suffered tingling and loss of sensation. Sarah, who describes herself as a 'healthy, outdoorsy type', was so debilitated that her GP referred her to a neurologist. After an MRI scan and various tests ruled out conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Sarah was finally diagnosed with unexplained neuralgia, or nerve pain, four months after her symptoms first began. By now she couldn't operate at the animal hospital where she practises without plunging her arms into buckets of ice afterwards to ease the pain. Then a colleague mentioned that his sister who'd had similar symptoms had been diagnosed with Lyme disease. 'I'd been on a walking holiday in the Scottish Highlands about a month before the symptoms appeared and remembered seeing leaflets about Lyme in the cabin I stayed in,' says Sarah, who lives in Ashford, Kent. 'But I hadn't paid much attention - I knew it was passed on by ticks and, as a vet, I remove them from animals all the time. I felt my training would have alerted me if they carried a real risk for humans.' But Lyme disease is a risk, affecting increasing numbers as milder winters and damper summers provide perfect conditions for ticks to thrive, according to the charity Lyme Disease Action. Official figures suggest 3,000 people a year in Britain are affected by the disease, although with symptoms similar to so many other conditions, such as fibromyalgia - a long-term condition causing pain all over the body - multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome, the charity estimates many people may have been misdiagnosed. The disease begins with a bite from an infected tick. The insect injects an anaesthetic, so the bite can't be felt, as well as the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria into the blood. In two-thirds of cases, this causes a distinctive bullseye-shaped red rash that spreads outwards, usually from the site of the bite. But it doesn't hurt and may go unnoticed - ticks can be as small as poppy seeds, and often climb up into the groin, armpit or scalp, where any redness may also go unnoticed. The victim may not even be particularly ill or may have only minor, flu-like symptoms that soon pass. However in some cases - particularly if they're not promptly diagnosed and treated - the disease can . Sarah then went to see a private specialist in Lyme disease, who recommended doxycycline antibiotics. Rash produced from deer tick bite leading to Lyme disease: The illness is affecting increasing numbers of people in the UK . 'I responded beautifully,' she says. 'Within three weeks the pain had gone and I was back operating on sick animals. Life returned to normal - I even fell in love.' However, Sarah relapsed last summer. 'I didn't think it possible, but the pain was 100 times worse,' she says. 'I couldn't brush my hair or lift a kettle. I was so weak. 'Nick, my boyfriend of just three months at that point, had to feed me and dress me. And the one time I did manage to make it downstairs from my sick bed, I couldn't get back upstairs again.' Sarah was signed off from work and had to use a wheelchair. 'My job is my vocation so it was just awful,' she says. 'There was a general fatigue and brain fog so dense I couldn't even remember the names of those closest to me. I was in such agony I wanted to die.' Dr Tim Brooks, a consultant microbiologist who works with Public Health England testing for Lyme disease, explains: 'If the Lyme organism isn't defeated by the immune system in the early stages, it can spread to other sites - particularly the nervous system and joint tissue, including the brain, causing inflammation that can lead to tingling, Bell's palsy (partial facial paralysis) or even, possibly, low-grade meningitis. 'If the disease is treated at this stage, the patient will usually make a quick recovery, although damage caused by the infection, such as tissue scarring or deterioration of nerve function, can take time to resolve.' This can take from six weeks to six months, and occasionally even longer. Dr Brooks is sceptical about patients relapsing, however, saying some take a long time to recover or get re-infected. 'The key is to get it early,' he advises. 'So our job is to increase awareness, among GPs as well as the public, to ensure patients with Lyme are recognised, diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.' But clearly prevention is also key. An estimated 10 per cent of ticks are thought to carry the Lyme bacteria. They are usually found living in long grass or undergrowth and are therefore common in woods, moors, parks and even gardens where there is also wildlife to feed on, explains Stella Huyshe-Shires, chair of Lyme Disease Action. 'They attach themselves to passing animals such as sheep, rabbits, mice, cats, dogs and even birds,' she adds. 'In humans, they can grab on to the outside of clothing and find their way onto skin under a waistband or up a sleeve and tend to keep going until they find somewhere moist and warm.' This means it's important to keep covered outdoors in areas of vegetation where there is also wildlife. 'And not just in the countryside,' Stella warns. 'Hedgehogs, badgers and foxes are common in urban areas and there are deer in increasing numbers in some public parks.' She recommends checking yourself, and children, for the tiny black specks, including around the hairline, then carefully detaching any found with a cotton thread wound around the tick close to the skin and pulled upwards, or a special tick remover available from vets or the Lyme Disease Action website. 'It's vital to avoid leaving behind the head, which can still then infect,' she says. If infection has occurred, symptoms typically take from a couple of days to a month to manifest. 'Flu-like symptoms developing after you've been in a potentially tick-infested environment should flash warning signs - particularly in summer and definitely if accompanied by a red rash,' says Stella. The test for Lyme involves a blood test to screen for antibodies and usually another to confirm the results. Results may come back negative, as antibodies can take weeks to develop, so the test may need to be repeated. Treatment is with antibiotics, which may also need to be repeated. After seeking help from specialists in the U.S. - where Lyme disease is more common - and persuading her GP to follow their advice on medication, Sarah began a second course of antibiotics last December which has reduced her pain by three-quarters. She is still on medication, but has less need for her wheelchair. 'It takes two days in bed to get my energy back after having a bath,' she says. 'But I feel much better and hope I will soon be back at work.' lymediseaseaction.org.uk .","Sarah Bignell got Lyme disease from after a walking holiday in Scotland .

"After decades of trying to shake off the shadow of Hitler, fears are growing that Germany is once more embracing the Fuehrer’s evil beliefs. The far Right continues to attract young recruits with  its message of racism and arrogance. And now an alarm bell has been sounded by the country’s biggest news magazine. Self analysis: 'Der Spiegel' on the shelf: The magazine is one of the largest news sources in Europe . Der Spiegel says the heady days of partying epitomised when Germany hosted the World Cup in 2006 are long gone. It concludes: ‘The reality is that there is hardly anything that interests the Germans as much about themselves as their relationship to the Hitler era.’ In a lengthy essay, the journal says: ‘This year, amid fresh debates over xenophobia, many are left wondering if the ugly German is back. 'When the Greeks or the Spaniards protest against the supposed dictatorship of the Germans in euro policy, some of their posters depict Nazi motifs. Hitler, pictured in January 1935, casts a long shadow over Germany, says Der Spiegel . 'When American author Tuvia Tenenbom recently travelled through Germany, he discovered plenty of anti-Semitism. We’re back where we didn’t want to be, caught in the spell of a Nazi past, one that also dominates the present. ‘When we look back at the media reports of 2012, there is much about this year that hints at the country’s Nazi past. And there doesn’t seem to be anything left of the happy, cosmopolitan Germany of 2006, nor of the exciting summer of 2010, when a young German team thrilled the world with its coltish and offensive approach to football at the World Cup in South Africa. ‘Many of the players were children of immigrants, and Germany came across as a relaxed, multicultural nation. ‘At the end of 2012, it seems as if we are the gloomy Germans once again, the Germans who either cannot or don’t want to shed their horrific past. It seems that it’s time for us to adjust our self-image once again. ‘We can celebrate as exuberantly as we wish, and we can play football as magnificently as we sometimes do, and yet the Nazi story will be with us for a long time to come.’ The magazine published its essay against the backdrop of Right-wing crimes dominating news headlines despite government attempts to ban the biggest neo-Nazi party, the NPD. In April Nobel prizewinning author Günter Grass was condemned as anti-Semitic after  writing a poem sharply critical of Israel. Then it emerged that Olympic rower Nadja Drygalla had a boyfriend who belonged to a far-Right group. The ugly German rears its head: The magazine's article is also available on the English version of Der Spiegel . Neo-Nazis also infiltrated a . neighbourhood in the city of Dortmund and established a presence among . fans of its football club, Borussia. This week's Der Spiegel magazine cover . But most disturbing was the fact that . police and intelligence agencies had tabs on the murderous National . Socialist Underground. Yet they did nothing to stop it murdering nine . immigrant businessmen and a policewoman in a 13-year reign of terror . which included bank robberies  and bombings. While these and many other stories played out, the far Right continued its insidious corruption of the young. This led to teachers in one eastern state being given the kind of vetting usually reserved for spies after it was found that Nazis were trying to indoctrinate children as young as three into thinking Hitler was a great man. Der Spiegel says: ‘The scandal is that young Germans in the 21st century feel the need to be neo-Nazis.’ It points out that other countries, such as Hungary and France, have elected far-Right politicians. But it adds: ‘Even after almost 70 years, it does make a difference whether an act of xenophobia happens in Germany. ‘We remain a special case, because Hitler is one of us.’","Best-selling magazine mourns the 'happy, cosmopolitan Germany of 2006'

"A two-year-old boy sat up in his coffin and asked for water before laying back down again lifeless, according to a Brazilian news website. In a case that seems almost too incredible to be true, ORM claimed that Kelvin Santos stopped breathing during treatment for pneumonia at a hospital in Belem, northern Brazil. He was declared dead at 7.40pm on Friday and his body was handed over to his family in a plastic bag. Two-year-old Kelvin Santos was declared dead on Friday after he stopped breathing during treatment for pneumonia . The child's devastated family took him home where grieving relatives held a wake throughout the night, with the boy's body laid in an open coffin. But an hour before his funeral was due to take place on Saturday the boy apparently sat up in his coffin and said: 'Daddy, can I have some water?'.

'Then Kelvin just laid back down, the way he was. We couldn't wake him. He was dead again. Mr Santos rushed his son back to the Aberlardo Santos hospital in Belem,where the doctors reexamined the boy and confirmed that he had no signs of life. He said: 'They assured me that he really was dead and gave me no explanation for what we had just seen and heard.' The boy's family decided to delay the funeral for an hour in the hope that he would wake up again, but ended up burying him at 5pm that day in a local cemetery.

Convinced that his son was victim of medical malpractice, Mr Santos has now registered a complaint with the police who have launched an investigation . He said: 'Fifteen minutes after rushing him away for resuscitation, they came and told me he was dead and handed me his body. Perhaps they didn't examine him properly. Dead people don't just wake up and talk. I'm determined to find out the truth.'

"Canadian lobsters have been discovered off the coast of Yorkshire - after being thrown overboard by  diners on cruise ships. Local fisherman are understood to have found the species in their lobster pots, 3,500 miles away from their natural habitat in the Atlantic ocean off the coast of North America. Experts believe that guilty passengers aboard cruise ships are buying live lobsters and ordering waiters to throw them overboard thinking that they are saving the shellfish. American lobsters are being found in British waters, some still with elastic bands around their claws . In some cases, local fishermen have reported finding some lobsters still with elastic bands around their claws. However, they are more likely throwing them to their deaths, experts say. The Canadian species – Homarus Americanus – cannot compete with the native European lobsters and are unable to interbreed. Scientists at the University of Hull have said they will examine any that are found in future to see if they carry disease that could be a threat to the native population. Canadian lobsters, also known as Homarus Americanus, have been discovered off the coast of Yorkshire . Skipper Gary Redshaw last found one two years ago 50 to 60 miles east of Bridlington. He told the Yorkshire Post: ‘In the past we have heard one officer on the watch talking to another on the cruise ship saying some of the passengers were going to buy lobsters and release them, thinking they were doing good. ‘But in fact they can do a lot of damage. The Canadian species cannot compete with the native European lobsters and are unable to interbreed . Scientists at the University of Hull have said they will examine any Canadian Lobsters that are found in future to see if they carry disease that could be a threat to the native population . ‘I think it’s a good idea to study them as they could be giving English lobsters a disease.’ Finds of the Canadian lobster, whose closest relative is the European lobster, homarus gammarus, are rare, and laboratory tests have shown that while the different species will mate, their offspring are infertile. Mike Cohen, from Holderness Fishing Industry Group, adding: ‘We think the most likely route is that they are getting thrown overboard from cruise ships. ‘People buy lobster for dinner, feel sorry for it and ask the waiter to chuck it over. ‘In the grand scheme of things that’s a very small level of re-introduction. ‘They are found occasionally near Bridlington. ‘I understand from common frequency on the radio that passengers buy a lobster from the live tanks and then ask the waiter to throw them overboard rather than eating it. ‘The only ones that are found are large, plate-sized lobster. Some even have the elastic bands around their claws. Experts believe that well-meaning cruise ship passengers are buying live lobster and then throwing them overboard in the belief that they are saving them . ‘They are usually Canadian lobster as they are cheap. But the chances of them being established are very rare. 'They won’t last much longer than if the passengers had eaten them for dinner.’ Meanwhile, wildlife experts say exotic creatures from as far away as the Caribbean are arriving at the south coast of Britain after being transported thousands of miles on marine rubbish. An increasing number of species previously unseen in UK waters are turning up, having travelled across the Atlantic from the warm seas off Florida and Bermuda. Canadian lobsters from locations such as Nova Scotia (above) are arriving in the UK from their natural habitat in the Atlantic ocean off the Canadian and North American coast. Species that would normally not be able to survive have managed the mammoth journey of several thousand miles are still alive when they get here. Two species of tropical scallops were found living inside a plastic bait pot from the USA, said Dorset-based wildlife expert and photographer Steve Trewhella. The scallops would have entered tiny holes in the pot as larvae and stayed protected within it, growing into fully-formed scallops by the time they reached Dorset. Another recent find were three Columbus crabs living on an American or Canadian pot marker buoy. Mr Trewhella said: 'The increase in marine litter and oceanic litter in general has carried species that could not live naturally in these waters. 'There is a very real possibility that marine litter - if it hasn't already - will introduce foreign species. 'A few years ago, the introduction of skipper limpets completely wiped out the native oyster.'","Local fishermen have found the Homarus Americanus species in their pots .

When the 10-hour hit miniseries aired on the History Channel a year ago, bloggers immediately noted the similarities between Satan, played by Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, and the President and side-by-side comparisons of the two went viral online. Eager to avoid rehashing the drama, producers Roma Downey and Mark Burnett decided to leave the character out of their film, called 'Son of God,' which opens on February 28. Scroll down for video . Spooky: Scenes with the devil have been cut from the upcoming spin off of The Bible because of the actor, pictured in the miniseries, has an uncanny resemblance to President Barack Obama . 'It gives me great pleasure to tell you that the devil is on the cutting-room floor,' Downey told The Hollywood Reporter Monday. 'This is now a movie about Jesus, the son of God, and the devil gets no more screen time.' The 20th Century Fox film is basically a reshaped version of The Bible. But the miniseries needed to be trimmed from 10-hours to two hours. Downey said they went out of their way to leave the controversial Satan out of the film. After the Obama lookalike comments caused a firestorm on the Internet, Burnett, Downey and History each issued statements supporting the president and insisted they never intended to link Obama and Satan. 'Someone made a comment that the actor who played the devil vaguely resembled our president, and suddenly the media went nuts,' Downey told The Hollywood Reporter. 'The next day, when I was sure everyone would only be talking about Jesus, they were talking about Satan instead.' Firestorm: Side-by-side comparisons like this one went viral online after the show aired last March . New film: The movie 'Son of God' will open in cinemas on February 28, with no devil . She added: 'For our movie, Son of God, I wanted all of the focus to be on Jesus. I want his name to be on the lips of everyone who sees this movie, so we cast Satan out.' The controversial episode of 'The Bible' aired in March 2013 and immediately threw up an awkward coincidence when viewers noticed that Satan bore a remarkable resemblance to Obama. Twitter exploded during the airing with many pointing out the striking similarities between the 44th President and the devil, played by Ouzaani. The show was a surprise hit in the ratings, with some episodes of the religious mini-series attracting 13.1 million viewers - topping television leviathan American Idol's 12.8 million viewers. Right-wing commentator and radio-host Glenn Beck first pointed out the eerie similarity, tweeting, 'Anyone else think the Devil in #TheBible Sunday on History Channel looks exactly like That Guy?' Twitter wrath: The popular religious show was a surprise hit but viewers  took to Twitter to express their shock at the similarities of the two men . Others were simply struck by the clear physical match. Twitter . user @Leah Christie, tweeted, 'Oh my word...watching The History . Channel's The Bible..does Satan look familiar to anyone else?' While Matthew Gaudet commented, 'Watching The Bible series on the History channel and noticed the guy playing the role of Satan, looks strikingly similar to Obama.' The unfortunate incident bore comparison with HBO's infamous inclusion of a fake George W. Bush head impaled onto a stick during the background of a Season 1 Game of Thrones episode. When the Bush incident went viral, the network announced it was pulling the offending episode - from its rotation, freezing shipments of DVD box sets and halting sales on iTunes until the embarrassing blunder had been fixed. 'We were deeply dismayed to see this and find it unacceptable, disrespectful and in very bad taste,' HBO said in a statement. Spiked: Former U.S. President George W. Bush's surprise appearance on HBO's fantasy series Game of Thrones, bares comparison to President Obama's look-a-like on The Bible . 'We made this clear to the executive producers of the series, who apologized immediately for this careless mistake.' HBO and the show's creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, apologized for the incident. Benioff and Mr Weiss, who noted the appearance in the series' DVD commentary, insist it wasn't a political statement - just a prop. The Bible, and now Son of God, retells the stories from the scriptures in a scripted format, from Genesis through to Revelation, the last book of the New Testament. The miniseries' popularity came as somewhat of a mystery. For one, the drama wasn't a hit with television critics, receiving a mediocre score of 44 on the Metacritic site. Not again: Producers Mark Burnett and his wife Roma Downey said they cut the scenes featuring the devil to avoid further controversy . 'As a cable series, The Bible lacked the ready-made, large scale promotional platform and popular lead-in that can drive strong ratings for a new show on a major broadcast network, of the kind NBC was, for many years,' writes a columnist in The Washington Times. Indeed, Burnett told Entertainment Weekly that the series' success seemed almost preordained while it was being made. 'The hand of God was on this,' he said in an interview before the show's premiere. 'The edit came together perfectly, the actors came together perfectly, it just comes to life.' Burnett is most famous for creating reality shows such as Survivor.

"A 19-year-old college student from Ohio is accusing Instagram of size discrimination after her account was removed following a photo she took of herself in a bra and boy shorts. Samm Newman, who is U.S. size 24, told NBC4i that the modest polka dot underwear covered her in the image, adding: 'I've seen [lingerie] . pictures like that all over Instagram.' Instagram, which has guidelines against sharing photos that show nudity, removed Miss Newman's account for 'violating community guidelines', but the social media platform has since apologized, saying it 'wrongly removed content and worked to rectify the error as soon as we were notified'. Samm Newmann, a 19-year-old college student from Ohio, is accusing Instagram of size discrimination after her account was removed following a photo she took of herself in a bra and boy shorts . 'When our team processes reports from other members of the Instagram community, we occasionally make a mistake,' explained a spokesperson for Instagram, who added that the company acted off a user complaint in this instance. 'We apologize for any inconvenience.' Paradoxically, Miss Newman, who . was bullied through junior high and high school, said her self-confidence improved when she got into college thanks to support she found online. 'Fat is not a bad word,' said Miss Newman. 'How confident can you be if you keep censoring yourself because people don't want to look at you?' Four . months ago, Miss Newman found a group of young women through hash tags . like #bodylove and #pizzasister4lyfe; they began following each other, . and complimenting pictures in the comments section. 'My Instagram was my safe place because when I was there, I could share anything' 'My Instagram, it was my safe place because when I was there, I could share anything,' Miss Newman said, adding that there is a double standard on within the community. 'I . didn't find the bra at all inappropriate,' explained Miss Newman, . saying that there are accounts dedicated entirely to lingerie shots of . slimmer women. The college student said she hopes her story will provide motivation for other plus-size women. 'I’m going to make a difference in the world,' she said. This isn't the first time Instagram has been forced to apologize after removing a plus-size woman’s photo. Instagram, which has guidelines against sharing photos that show nudity, initially removed Miss Newman's account for 'violating community guidelines' - but the company has since apologized and reinstated it . In May, 29-year-old Meghan Tonjes, from Los Angeles, shared a 'butt selfie', which showed her wearing a pair of black bikini briefs and T-shirt. It was captioned 'booty appreciation #honormycurves #effyourbeautystandards'. She was furious when she received an email from Instagram notifying her that the image had been taken down because it violated the site's nudity rules - despite the fact that thousands of Instagram users, including Kim Kardashian and ‘butt selfie queen’ Jen Selter, post similar photos every day without issue. Ms Tonjes, who weighed 321lbs at her heaviest, responded with a powerful YouTube tirade accusing Instagram of double standards. Miss Newman, who is U.S. size 24, said that Instgram has double standards, explaining: 'I've seen [lingerie] pictures all over Instagram' - pictured: Miley Cyrus (left) and a Lonely Lingerie model (right) 'I didn't find the bra at all inappropriate,' said Miss Newman of her selfie,adding that slimmer women, especially celebrities like WAG Caroline Berg Eriksen (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) often post lingerie images . In the eight-and-a-half-minute-long video, titled 'Dear Instagram', she says: 'I have no shame. 'I've posted photos along my weight-loss and transformation of me in gym clothes, in underwear, just photos of parts of my body that I'm super happy with and I'm super proud of and I've embraced getting older.' 'I have pride for my curves. My still very fat body, I like a lot.' The film quickly attracted more than 80,000 hits with many viewers congratulating Ms Tonjes for highlighting the issue of social media photo etiquette. 'You are completely right, when someone doesn't fit in the ""normal"" category of society, everyone grabs a torch, but when the torch-wielders post pictures like that no one cares,' one fan wrote. Thanks to her campaign, Instagram issued an apology and estored the 'butt selfie' to Ms Tonjes' account.","Instagram has since apologized to Samm Newman, 19, saying it 'wrongly removed' her account .

"It’s been less than three months since Apple unveiled its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but rumours suggest the firm is gearing up for its next release already. Reports say Apple may hold two iPhone launch events next year, to release its iPhone 6S in spring, and its iPhone 7 in September. The iPhone 6S may even go on sale at the same time as Apple’s upcoming Watch. Reports claim Apple may hold two iPhone launch events next year to release its iPhone 6S (a successor to its iPhone 6 pictured) in spring, and its iPhone 7 in September. The iPhone 6S may even go on sale at the same time as Apple’s Watch . The claims were made by ‘sources in the supply chain’ to Jerry Miller from Stabley Times. Until 2013, Apple released one handset each year around September time. This included a new model one year, followed by a slightly modified 'S-version' the year after. Last year, however, it used its September launch event to announce two new devices - its flagship iPhone 5S and the ‘cheaper’ iPhone 5C. This was followed by the launch of its iPhone 6 and larger iPhone 6 Plus this year. The new schedule is expected to stagger the releases of two devices in 2015 to capitalise on sales. Apple could release the iPhone 6S to people who want to upgrade to a slightly cheaper model, before announcing its flagship iPhone 7 in the autumn. Until 2013, Apple released one handset each year around September time. Last year, however, it used its September launch event to announce two new devices - its flagship iPhone 5S and the ‘cheaper’ iPhone 5C (pictured). This was followed by the launch of its iPhone 6 and larger iPhone 6 Plus this year . The 6S may also be packaged together with the Apple Watch. ‘Our source says that Apple is hesitant about launching the iWatch in the spring of 2015 without a new iPhone to go along with it,’ explained Mr Miller. ‘[This] could give hesitant consumers an excuse to wait on buying both until the fall.’ The news comes as manufacturers revealed Apple has plans to kill off its iPhone 5C as early as next summer. Amidst the furore of the iPhone 6 launch in September, Apple silently killed off its Classic iPod. But it wasn't a drop in sales that brought about its demise, according to boss Tim Cook, instead it was blamed on a lack of mechanical parts. Speaking at the WSJD Live conference, Mr Cook said the tech giant no longer had access to the components needs to make the once iconic music player. And although sales for the product had fallen significantly in recent years, sourcing parts was the final nail in the coffin. Mr Cook added the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts, but it wouldn't have been cost-effective and would have involved a 'massive' task. Launching a phone in spring would mean there was still the same number of handsets in the range once the iPhone 5C was discontinued. The report, by Taiwan's Industrial and Commercial times, did not reveal the reasons behind the plans, but Apple has previously been known to discontinue models as they are replaced by newer versions. Sales of the 5C were also poor, compared to the company's expectations, and in January, research firm CIRP reports the model accounted for just 27 per cent of iPhone sales at the end of 2013. Manufacturers will begin winding down production of the handset from January, and are expected to pull the plug completely by the 'middle of 2015.' Apple launched its iPhone 5C alongside the high-end iPhone 5S in September 2013. It is similar in size to the 5S, but doesn't t have the Touch ID fingerprint scanner or the A7 processor seen in the more expensive model. It has a plastic case, is available in five different colours, and at launch, prices started at $99 in the US, on a two-year contract, or $549 and £469 when bought outright. The device was also the first Apple phone to be offered in the smaller 8GB model. Apple also recently killed off its iPod Classic. The news comes as manufacturers revealed Apple has plans to kill off its iPhone 5C  next summer. Sales of the 5C (pictured at launch with Apple executive Phil Schiller) were lower than expected. Launching a phone in spring would mean there was still the same number of handsets in the range once the 5C was discontinued . When Apple’s online store came back online following its iPhone 6 event in September, this later model was missing from the iPod lineup. Apple did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line at the time. Apple boss Tim Cook later said the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts, but it wouldn't have been cost-effective and would have involved a 'massive' task. 'We couldn't get the parts anymore, not anywhere on Earth,' explained Mr Cook. 'It wasn't a matter of me swinging the axe, saying ""What can I kill today?"" The Classic was the Apple’s first digital music player, and although the original debuted in 2001, there were six generations released up until 2007. Apple is said to be forsaking its iPhone 5C to focus on production of its high-end iPhone 6 range.","Apple traditionally releases its iPhone and iPads annually .

"A kitchen with a lavatory at one end – it would be hard to imagine a more unsanitary place to live. This unappealing arrangement is what planning officers found when they investigated outbuildings that they suspected fell foul of planning laws. These are the grotty living quarters in Cambridge of Jarek Sluka, a chef from the Czech republic who has been living in the UK for eight years . The Council's action in Cambridge comes at a time of growing controversy over the use of garden sheds to house low-paid immigrants in areas where property commands high prices. The city has a large student population but East Anglia’s agriculture and food processing sectors have proved a strong magnet for thousands of Eastern European immigrants. The influx has led property developers to rent out renovated garages and sheds. Yesterday a chef from the Czech Republic said he has lived in another concrete outbuilding since May and said he was ‘very happy’ there. Jarek Sluka, 32, who moved to Britain eight years ago, said: ‘When I come back from work it’s nice to be able to rest here. I don’t want to move and it is just nice to enjoy our quiet life here. It doesn’t bother me.’ The toilet-come-kitchen was found in this brick out building behind a semi-detached house . In a separate bungalow were bedrooms for two people which feature a Czech flag . Landlord Tony Waite clashed with his local authority when he built a back garden chalet bungalow with three bedrooms, a lounge, a kitchen and a bathroom on the site of an old garage. The two ramshackle homes were built behind this property in Cambridge where there is a shortage of housing . But when council bosses told him they intended to take enforcement action, he removed the kitchen and placed it in a nearby outbuilding, which was already equipped with a toilet. He claimed this showed that the new building’s residents used facilities in the main house and it was therefore not separate accommodation. However, the plan failed and he has now been ordered to tear down the bungalow. He intends to appeal against the ruling. Mr Waite, who has two tenants in the outhouse and two in the bungalow, claimed the toilet was installed for people working on the site and the kitchen was not properly fitted. ‘The kitchen was temporary and was moved into the shed holding the toilet so the tenants didn’t have to all use the kitchen in the main house,’ he said. ‘I intend to appeal and I will not let my tenants become homeless.’ Lib Dem councillor Sarah Brown said: ‘I have never seen anything like that in three-and-a-half years of evaluating planning applications and I hope it is a one-off.’ Labour councillor Lewis Herbert added: ‘There has to be controls to make sure these places are safe and reasonable, especially in a city where there’s such a shortage of accommodation that people will live wherever they can find.’ Earlier this year the Daily Mail published a map created with heat-imaging cameras that showed garden outbuildings in a London street where officials believe as many as 1,000 migrants could have been living secretly. The discovery, in Hounslow, west London, led borough leaders to believe there may be 20,000 sheds rented out to 50,000 immigrants. This shed housed two people but Mr Waite has now been ordered to tear it down after a visit from city planners .","Toilet found in kitchen of an outhouse .

"Leon Brittan (pictured arriving at his home last week) has been questioned by police over claims he raped a 19-year-old student in 1967 . Former Home Secretary Leon Brittan has been questioned by police over claims he raped a 19-year-old student. The assault, which he is said to strongly deny, is alleged to have taken place at his Central London flat in 1967 following a blind date. Brittan was in his late 20s at the time of the alleged incident. Police said last night that the woman originally made a complaint in late 2012. It is being investigated by officers from the Metropolitan Police’s Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command. Scotland Yard confirmed that a man in his 70s was ‘interviewed under caution by appointment at a Central London location in connection with the allegation. He was not arrested. Inquiries continue.’ It is understood Lord Brittan, now 74, was questioned last month at the offices of his lawyers, Mishcon de Reya. The Mail on Sunday has been told that the woman initially contacted high-profile Labour MP Tom Watson, who has made allegations of widespread child abuse in Parliament. It is believed the detectives who questioned the veteran Conservative politician – he was made a life peer in 2000  – are part of Scotland Yard’s Operation Fairbank inquiry team which was launched after Mr Watson’s claims. Apparently believing the investigation was not moving quickly enough, the alleged victim, now aged 66, contacted Mr Watson a second time – and it was soon afterwards that Lord Brittan was formally interviewed. The assault, which Leon Brittan is said to strongly deny, is alleged to have taken place at his Central London flat in 1967 following a blind date. Brittan was in his late 20s (above) at the time of the alleged incident . Mishcon de Reya did not respond to requests to comment last night. Lord Brittan was also unavailable for comment. However, a prominent Westminster . journalist has revealed that the peer insisted as long ago as the 1980s . when he was Home Secretary that allegations against him of sexual . misconduct were untrue. Chris . Moncrieff, former political editor of the Press Association,  told The . Mail on Sunday: ‘I was at a drinks reception attended by Leon Brittan at . the height of frenzied rumours about him when one of his officials . called me to one side. 'The official said, “The Home Secretary wishes to speak to you in private.” 'I was led into a side room where Leon Brittan said to me, “You do know all these stories about me  are totally untrue, don’t you?” ‘He didn’t discuss any details but he said he was certain he would  be vindicated.’ Lord Brittan’s rise to power was impressive. The former barrister contested the constituency of North Kensington twice before becoming an MP in 1974 for Cleveland and Whitby, and then switched his constituency to Richmond in Yorkshire in 1983. When he was promoted to become Treasury Chief Secretary, he was the youngest member of the Cabinet. Later, as Home Secretary, he was the youngest in that job since Sir Winston Churchill. He quit the Cabinet in 1986 over the Westland helicopter affair. Four years ago, he was appointed trade adviser to the Government after David Cameron said he had ‘unrivalled experience’. A Labour peer is being investigated by police after 12 men made allegations of historical child abuse against him, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Sources close to  the investigation  last night said that the ‘horrific’ allegations include rape and serious sexual assault. It is understood the alleged abuse took place over several decades. The Mail on Sunday has chosen not to name the peer being investigated. A police spokesman said last night: ‘A number of individuals have come forward and made complaints to the investigation. ‘We are thoroughly investigating their allegations and providing them with professional support.’ It is understood that a file . containing the accusations has been sent to the Crown Prosecution . Service. Police also last night confirmed the peer has not been arrested . or questioned about the allegations. They refused to comment on the age . of the victims when the abuse took place. A source close to the investigation said: ‘These are some of the most horrific child abuse allegations you can imagine.’ Another source said: ‘The sexual abuse that the peer has been accused of is extremely worrying. A Labour peer is being investigated after 12 men made allegations of historical child abuse against him . The allegations are harrowing and must have affected the vulnerable boys significantly in later life. ‘It is becoming clear there is a problem with historic sex abuse  in Parliament and the police have  to be allowed access to all the information needed to  investigate these allegations. It is beginning to look like Westminster is above the law. It is important  that these allegations are investigated thoroughly.’ The investigation into the peer comes in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal and shocking revelations concerning Cyril Smith, the disgraced Liberal Democrat MP, and Labour links to the Paedophile Information Exchange group, which wanted to legalise  sex with children.

"Thousands of Iraqi Christians today poured out of Mosul after ISIS jihadis gave them an ultimatum - convert, pay or face death. The Islamic State terror group declared that Christians must either convert to Islam, pay a special tax or leave the city, around 250 miles north-west of Baghdad. If they did not do so by noon (9am GMT) today, there would be 'nothing for them but the sword', it said. Scroll down for video . Exodus: Thousands of Iraqi Christians today poured out of Mosul after ISIS jihadis gave them an ultimatum - convert to Islam, pay a special tax or face death. Above, Christian women pray at a church in Arbil, Kurdistan . As militants attempted to break government defences in strategic areas and edge closer to Baghdad, Christians fled to join hundreds of thousands of Shiite and other refugees in the neighbouring autonomous region of Kurdistan. Their escape to the safety coincided with the expected homecoming of Iraq's Kurdish president, Jalal Talabani, after 18 months of medical treatment in Germany. Chaldean patriarch Louis Sako, who heads Iraq's largest Christian community, said the terrifying ultimatum had been relayed by mosques in ISIS-controlled Mosul. He told AFP: 'Christian families are on their way to Dohuk and Arbil [in Kurdistan]. For the first time in the history of Iraq, Mosul is now empty of Christians.' Refugees: The Christians joined hundreds of thousands of Shiite and other refugees in the neighbouring autonomous region of Kurdistan. Above, Shia Turkmens flee from Sincar to Arbil yesterday due to attacks . Escape: Human Rights Watch said the Islamic State 'seems intent on wiping out all traces of minority groups from areas it now controls in Iraq.' Above, Shia Turkments carry their possessions to Arbil yesterday . Most Christians in the northwestern Nineveh province fled in terror after jihadist-led militants enforcing an extreme version of sharia - or Islamic law - launched an offensive on June 9. But many of the poorest families returned when the fighting stopped and ISIS started administering the city. Mr Sako said the number of Christians who were still in Mosul on Thursday was around 25,000. Today, Human Rights Watch said the Islamic State 'seems intent on wiping out all traces of minority groups from areas it now controls in Iraq.' Journey: The mass displacement was the latest in six weeks of turmoil which has forced more than 600,000 people from their homes, left thousands dead and brought Iraq to the brink of collapse . Other minorities rooted in the same province of Nineveh have suffered even more than the Christians, according to crimes HRW documented against the Yazidis, as well as the Turkmen and Shabak Shiite communities. The mass displacement was the latest in six weeks of turmoil which has forced more than 600,000 people from their homes, left thousands dead and brought Iraq to the brink of collapse. Iraq's Christian population includes Chaldean, Assyrian, Armenian and Syriac communities. Some of these are among the world's oldest and speak a form of Aramaic, a language thought to have been spoken by Jesus Christ. Chaldo-Assyrians follow eastern rites of the Catholic Church, while Syriacs consider themselves Eastern Orthodox. The Christian population once numbered more than a million nationwide, with upwards of 600,000 in Baghdad alone, but now there are now fewer than 400,000 across Iraq. This is largely because since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, sectarian attacks . against them have been mounting. Iraq is also home to a small community of Mandean Sabeans. They are not considered Christians and practice one of the world's oldest surviving Gnostic religions, but they worship John the Baptist as their central prophet. Now-executed president Saddam Hussein's deputy prime minister Tareq Aziz is from a Chaldean Catholic family and is one of Iraq's best known Christians. Mr Talabani's return to his native Kurdistan today was likely to spark celebrations among supporters from his Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party. He is widely celebrated as a skilled negotiator, who enjoys good relations with both the United States and Iran and has repeatedly mediated between Iraq's fractious politicians in recent years. But some observers warned there was little the avuncular 80-year-old head of state could do to ease spiralling ethno-sectarian violence and rhetoric and roll back the Islamic State's expansion. 'I really do think this is a post-Talabani era. I've stuck my neck out there, but I haven't heard any Iraqis talking about him in any way being president,' said Toby Dodge, director of the London School of Economics' Middle East centre. Federal forces collapsed, in some cases abandoning uniforms and weapons in their retreat, when fighters under the command of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi launched their assault. The army has since regrouped, received . intelligence, hardware and manpower from Washington, Moscow and Shiite . militias, but nonetheless struggled to regain lost territory. Security . analysts have said Baghdad remains too big a target, but militants have . in recent days repeatedly attacked targets that would expose the capital . if captured. On . Thursday night, a jihadist commando stormed the Speicher air base north . of ex-president Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, sparking a fierce . battle. 'Last night, gunmen infiltrated the base. There were snipers and suicide bombers among them, they managed to . reach the runway,' an intelligence officer who survived the attack told . AFP. Shocking: ISIS militants were captured on video taking sledgehammers to Christian and Muslim tombstones earlier this month. They were filmed attacking centuries-old graves in the city of Mosul in Ninevah province . Attack: Donning balaclavas and black coats, the militants swung sledgehammers into the old tombstones . He said the pilots managed to fly all but one of the base's aircraft to safety - but a statement posted on jihadist Internet sites said many were destroyed. Many people, including within his own Shiite alliance that comfortably won April elections, now see Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's departure as essential to national reconciliation efforts. In a Friday sermon delivered by one of his spokesmen in Karbala, the Iranian-born Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani - Iraq's most revered Shiite cleric - appeared to lean in the same direction. 'The new government should have broad national acceptance and be capable of solving the crisis in the country and correcting the mistakes of the past,' he said. Parliamentary blocs have until Sunday to submit nominees for the post of president, whose election is the next step in what has been a protracted and acrimonious process to renew Iraq's leadership. Despite his unexpected return, there is little expectation that Mr Talabani, who has been president since 2005, will seek another term. It comes just weeks after a video emerged showing ISIS militants taking sledgehammers to centuries-old tombstones in Mosul in Ninevah province. Donning balaclavas and black coats, the rebels swung sledgehammers into the tombs, causing pieces of dust and stone to fly through the air.","ISIS told Christians they must convert, pay special tax or leave Mosul, Iraq .

"Former Home Secretary Leon Brittan this morning said he asked officials to look carefully at a dossier handed to him in the 1980s allegedly containing claims of a Westminster paedophile network. The Tory peer released a statement after he was challenged to make public what he knew about the file handed to him at the time by a fellow Conservative MP. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, told the Home Affairs Select Committee that Lord Brittan had been sent a dossier of allegations about paedophiles between 1983 and 1985 by Geoff Dickens MP. Labour MP Simon Danczuk called for a Hillsborough style inquiry into historic child abuse sex allegations. He said Leon Brittan, who was Home Secretary in the 1980s should share his knowledge about a dossier sent to Whitehall detailing allegations of a Westminster paedophile ring . Lord Brittan this morning said he had received the dossier during his time as Home Secretary. He said he had asked officials to look into the claims, but did 'not recall being contacted further about these matters'. In a statement released through his lawyer, Lord Brittan said: 'During my time as Home Secretary (1983 to 1985), Geoff Dickens MP arranged to see me at the Home Office. I invariably agreed to see any MP who requested a meeting with me. 'As I recall, he came to my room at the Home Office with a substantial bundle of papers. As is normal practice, my Private Secretary would have been present at the meeting. 'I told Mr Dickens that I would ensure that the papers were looked at carefully by the Home Office and acted on as necessary. 'Following the meeting, I asked my officials to look carefully at the material contained in the papers provided and report back to me if they considered that any action needed to be taken by the Home Office. 'In addition I asked my officials to consider a referral to another Government Department, such as the Attorney General's Department, if that was appropriate. 'This was the normal procedure for handling material presented to the Home Secretary. I do not recall being contacted further about these matters by Home Office officials or by Mr Dickens or by anyone else.' In a second statement released by Mr Brittan, he clariffied what happened to the dossier. He said: 'In the last hour I have been alerted to a Home Office independent review conducted last year into what information it received about organised child sex abuse between 1979 and 1999. 'The review found information had been dealt with properly. It also disclosed that material received from Mr Dickens in November 1983 and January 1984 had not been retained. 'However, a letter was sent from myself to Mr Dickens on March 20, 1984 explaining what had been done in relation to the files.' Lord Brittan's statements today came after Labour MP Mr Danczuk told a Parliamentary committee yesterday that he believed politics was the 'last refuge of child sex abuse deniers'. He repeated his call for a Hillsborough-style inquiry into historical paedophile allegations. Mr Danczuk appeared before MPs on the Home . Affairs Select Committee after accusing the late Liberal MP Sir Cyril . Smith for Rochdale (pictured) of being a paedophile . Lord Brittan said last night that he would be issuing a statement at lunchtime today 'about the handling of such papers in the Home Office'. Mr Danczuk helped expose the full extent of Liberal MP Cyril Smith's paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year, serialised in the Daily Mail. The call for an inquiry into how Smith, the former Rochdale MP, and other high-profile paedophiles such as Jimmy Savile evaded justice for so long has now gained the support of 120 MPs. Mr Danczuk said a public inquiry would shed light on what was known about prominent paedophiles, and what the police and senior politicians did about it. He told the Commons home affairs select committee that he believed a series of home secretaries had questions to answer over what they had heard about allegations of paedophilia in high places. He said the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens had written to Lord Brittan, Home Secretary from 1983 to 1985, about paedophiles 'operating and networking within and around Westminster'. 'I do think it would be helpful for Sir Leon Brittan to share his knowledge of how he dealt with these allegations that were made at the time,' said Mr Danczuk. 'I think that politics is the last refuge of child sex abuse deniers. Other institutions, the police, have dealt with this and changed their culture.' But politics suffered from 'a continual view that we should sweep it under the carpet, that we shouldn't speak about it, that we shouldn't name people, that there shouldn't be a discussion about what's gone on'. Lord Brittan (pictured at his London home) was elevated to the Lords in . 2000 after a fifteen years in the Commons and 10 years at the European . Commission. He was also knighted in 1989 . Mr Danczuk said he had faced pressure not to name those allegedly involved in sexual abuse and said only an inquiry could 'bring all the different strands together'. 'I don't have all the answers, but we have to understand why the authorities failed to investigate such high-profile cases,' he said. Earlier this year, Mr Danczuk published a book into Smith's decades of abuse of young children, including at Knowl View school where he was a governor. A number of suspects have been identified and the MP said he understood from police that arrests were 'imminent'. In 1976 Smith wrote to the BBC criticising its investigations into the 'private lives of certain MPs'. The politician, who died in 2010, expressed 'deep concern' about a probe into an alleged campaign to discredit members of parliament. At the time the media had been investigating claims that South African secret agents had been trying to smear British MPs. In another letter, he urged the then Home Secretary, Merlyn Rees, to ensure the BBC was not using public money for 'muck-raking'. Former children's minister Tim Loughton said Smith's letters were 'bully-boy tactics'.","Tory peer said he was given dossier on Westminster paedophile network .

"Nick Clegg called for a police inquiry into the Cyril Smith scandal last night after finally admitting that there may have been an Establishment cover-up. After two weeks of obfuscation and denial, the Liberal Democrat leader at last conceded the need for a full police inquiry into the 29-stone paedophile’s vile sex crimes. He called for a probe into allegations of a conspiracy in which senior politicians, police and the security services colluded to cover up the former Rochdale MP’s reign of abuse over several decades. Accusing Smith of ‘truly grotesque acts’, Mr Clegg called on the police to investigate whether there was a wider paedophile ring involving politicians from all parties, not just his own. Changing his tune: Nick Clegg has called for a police inquiry into the Cyril Smith scandal after finally admitting there may have been an Establishment cover-up . But Mr Clegg still refuses to launch an investigation into what Liberal politicians knew about Smith’s abuse and whether they could have acted to bring him to justice. What the Deputy Prime Minister is desperate to avoid is an investigation that focuses solely on his party. However, Mr Clegg would not explain how any police inquiry would operate, saying it was up to the police to decide who should be questioned and which documents should be examined. Campaign: Simon Danczuk, the current Labour MP for Rochdale, welcomed Mr Clegg's change of heart . Although his call falls short of demands for a full public inquiry into historic child sex abuse cases, it is the first time Mr Clegg has accepted that the Establishment’s reaction to the scandal had not been good enough. Simon Danczuk, the campaigning Labour MP for Rochdale, welcomed the change of heart but said it was a shame Mr Clegg had to be led ‘kicking and screaming’ to make it. He called on police to question former Liberal leader Lord Steel, who recommended Smith for a knighthood in 1988 despite claims that rumours of his abuse were known at the highest levels. Police believe Smith, who died in 2010, abused dozens of boys at care homes in Rochdale and London during the 1960s and 1970s. Despite numerous investigations, he was never charged with any offence. Three times the Director of Public Prosecutions rejected police files detailing his abuse, claiming the cases would not stand up in court. An explosive book by Mr Danczuk, serialised in the Mail, reveals that Smith was protected by local politicians, the police and even the security services. He claims other politicians were involved in abuse, and that Smith may have been at the heart of a paedophile ring. When the allegations first came to light, Mr Clegg rejected calls for further inquiries – saying an internal probe had shown that no one knew anything. He was also accused of obfuscation by saying the allegations dated from before the formation of the Lib Dems, and that many of them dated from before he was born. Yesterday, however, speaking in Colchester at the launch of the Lib Dems’ European election campaign, he said: ‘The accusations and allegations surrounding Cyril Smith are very, very serious. ‘They are also part of a set of allegations that there was a wider conspiracy involving politicians from other parties involving a cover-up by the police and security services. This was looked into by the police in the past and not pursued. ‘A police inquiry is the only way we can get to the bottom of something which spans so many decades, which covered so many different organisations, and touches on so many different political parties and the police. ‘That is why I very much hope that, in addition to the inquiries the police are already conducting into children’s homes where abuse is alleged to have taken place, that they will not hesitate to reopen this so that every aspect can be looked at and people, particularly victims, can feel that justice is finally being done.’ Mr Clegg said police should also look at whether other politicians were involved in a paedophile ring. But he denied he was evading his party’s responsibility to investigate the scandal. ‘It involves reprehensible criminal acts and collusion, covering up of those criminal acts,’ he said. ‘That is not something that any political party could possibly resolve.’ Mr Danczuk welcomed Mr Clegg’s call for an investigation as a ‘step in the right direction’. He added: ‘I think it is a shame that Nick Clegg has taken two weeks to do this. He is the Deputy Prime Minister after all; one of the most powerful people in the country. He should have taken the issue of paedophilia and cover-ups much more seriously than he has in the past, and it is unfortunate that he has been dragged kicking and screaming to this position.’ Last night a Lib Dem MP said there must have been people in Westminster in the 1970s who had heard the rumours of Smith’s abuse but kept quiet. David Ward, MP for Bradford East, said: ‘They should have done something about it. Where there are rumours they should be investigated, however important that person is within the organisation.’ Letter from Lord Steel . http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-2829357/Letter-Lord-Steel.html .","Lib Dem leader calls for probe into allegations of a conspiracy among senior politicians .

"The investigation was triggered by the Home Office's Permanent Secretary Mark Sedwill . The head of the Home Office has ordered an investigation into shocking allegations that the Government gave tens of thousands of pounds to a notorious paedophile group. Civil servants are trawling through decades’ worth of files to look for any evidence that the Home Office once funded the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which openly campaigned to legalise child sex. The extraordinary move has been triggered by Permanent Secretary Mark Sedwill following claims by an ‘insider’ that the Voluntary Services Unit (VSU), which gave annual grants totalling thousands of pounds to charities, had provided financial assistance to the network of abusers. Labour MP Tom Watson says a retired Home Office employee told him he had raised concerns in the 1970s about the funding, but was warned to drop the matter. Mr Watson told The Mail on Sunday . last night: ‘We are lifting the lid on a murky period in political . history. It feels as if we are getting closer to getting the answers . that many people have been looking for for a long time. ‘People will be astounded if we discover that a Government of any political hue was funding the PIE.' A spokesman for the Home Office confirmed: ‘We are aware of the allegations and the Permanent Secretary has commissioned a thorough, independent investigation into what funding the VSU previously provided.’ It is hoped the inquiry will finally uncover the truth about the links between paedophiles and the State following almost 40 years of claims of an establishment cover-up. Civil servants are trawling through decades' worth of files to look for any evidence that the Home Office once funded the Paedophile Information Exchange . PIE was formed in the early 1970s and openly called for the age of consent to be lowered to four, despite public outrage. In 1976 morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse accused a gay charity that did receive Government grants, the Albany Trust, of helping fund PIE, but this was denied at the time. A one time chairman of PIE, Steven Smith, worked as a heating and lighting engineer at the Home Office’s headquarters in Whitehall until he was exposed by a Sunday newspaper in 1982. He went on the run but was jailed for possessing 3,000 drawings of child abuse two years ago. Tom Watson says a retired Home Office employee told him he had raised concerns in the 1970s about the funding, but was warned to drop the matter . After a PIE leader Tom O’Carroll was jailed in 1981 it emerged that a retired diplomat, Sir Peter Hayman, had been a supporter of the network and police had discovered his collection of obscene diaries but decided not to prosecute him. The MP who exposed him, Geoffrey Dickens, also handed three dossiers on PIE and alleged child abusers to the Home Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions but it is claimed they were ignored. Following calls by child protection . campaigners, an independent review was held in February this year of all . Home Office files from 1979 to 1999 to ‘identify any information . received about organised child abuse’. Led by an HMRC investigator, it . examined 746,000 files and identified ‘13 items of information about . alleged child abuse, including four cases involving Home Office staff’. These . four workers were all dismissed between 1996 and 1998, recent Freedom . of Information documents state, but no evidence was found of links . between them or use of ‘Home Office equipment or facilities’. The . review concluded that the Home Office ‘did pass on to the appropriate . authorities’ all the information it received about child abuse, as well . as taking action against suspected staff. Whitehall sources said the new review was at an early stage.","Government allegedly gave tens of thousands of pounds to Paedophile Information Exchange, which openly campaigned to legalise child sex .

"Libyan rebels claim to have found a mass grave containing the bodies of 150 civilians slaughtered by forces loyal to Colonel Gadaffi. A spokesman said rebel forces had found the buried bodies of civilians about 60 miles to the west of the city of Misrata. He claimed in addition to the grave, troops had discovered video 'showing kidnappers cutting the throats of people'. A tank taken from Gadaffi forces by rebel troops blocks a road in Zawiya, western Libya . The spokesman said: 'We discovered a mass grave containing 150 bodies in Tawargha. These are the corpses of civilians kidnapped from Misrata by Gaddafi’s loyalists.' Rebel troops are now believed to be working their way up the coastal road outside the town of Hisha about 100 km west of Misrata as they advance towards Tripoli. They took control of an oil refinery in the western town of Zawiyah and blocked the main highway north to the capital on Thursday, further isolating Muammar Gaddafi’s Tripoli stronghold. The advances in recent days have cut Gaddafi’s forces off from their main supply routes following a long stalemate, putting the Libyan leader’s 41-year rule under unprecedented pressure. The Zawiyah refinery is one of the few sources of fuel for Gaddafi’s troops and the people of Tripoli. Small groups of rebel fighters . occupied the inside of the Zawiyah refinery complex, about 30 miles west . of Tripoli on the highway linking Tripoli to Tunisia, with no sign of . the pro-Gaddafi forces that had battled for the plant for days. A rebel commander said the pipeline linking it to Tripoli was severed on Tuesday. Doctors . at a hospital south of Zawiyah said nine people were killed and at . least 45 injured in fighting around the town and at the refinery on . Wednesday, most of them rebels. Making ground: A rebel fighter carries an RPG in the town of Sabratha, 50 miles west of Tripoli . A rebel fighter finds shelter from shelling in a mosque which is under construction in Sabratha . A fighter keeps a lookout on his vehicle in Ajdabiya, Libya . They said pro-Gaddafi forces had hit a house near the hospital with Grad rockets. Rebels are also in control of the town of Garyan, about 80 km south of Tripoli on the main highway and have placed a T-34 tank and an anti-aircraft gun taken from Gaddafi forces in the main square. One of the fighters said: 'We took one tank and an anti-aircraft gun from Gaddafi’s forces. Next, we will go to Tripoli.' A spokesman for Gaddafi played down recent rebel gains and said the government remained in control of the country. He said: 'This is a crisis that will last a few days and then it will be, God willing, overcome. 'We will push ahead and until we liberate the whole country.' Fernando Calado of the International Organisation for Migration has expressed concerns at the news that the pipeline carrying oil to Tripoli from Zawiyah had been cut. He said: 'that would imply dire consequences for the population in Tripoli in terms of fuel supplies needed for the city to keep operating.' He said there had been a sharp . increase in the past week in the number of foreign nationals asking to . be evacuated and estimated that more than 300,000 foreigners remain in . Tripoli, including many from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Chad, Egypt and . Tunisia. He added: 'We . have received 2,000 requests at this point. The potential caseload is . huge. We’re exploring the possibility of land, sea and air evacuations.' Casualty: A rebel fighter receives treatment at a hospital in Ajdabiya . Libya’s rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) denies holding secret talks with Gaddafi to end the war. But suspicions persist that some form of end-game negotiation may be going on. The NTC insists Gaddafi should step down and leave Libya, saying talks ignoring this basic demand would be 'unthinkable'. Aided by NATO bombers, assault helicopters and a naval blockade, the rebels have transformed the battle in the last few days after many weeks of stalemate. The United States also deployed two more Predator drones for surveillance operations over Libya, a U.S. official said on Wednesday. It was unclear how many drones the U.S. already had over the country. In Brega, on the eastern front, rebel forces said they had suffered 18 killed and 33 wounded on Tuesday and Wednesday in their battle to dislodge Gaddafi forces from the oil port and refinery, where they have been fighting for many days. The 69-year-old Gaddafi seems isolated with rebel forces closing in and vowing to enter Tripoli by the end of the month.",Opposition forces seize vital oil refinery just 30 miles from Tripoli .
"Mischa Barton's weight has yo-yoed since she shot to fame as Marissa Cooper on the O.C back in 2003. But as she prepares for her new movie role, the actress, who has been displaying a fuller figure lately, has taken matters into her own hands. Mischa, 28, has been taking a mushroom based supplement to manage her weight - and claims she's lost 4lbs in a week. Scroll down for video . Helping hand: Mischa Barton claims to have lost 4lbs in a week taking a new mushroom based supplement . 'As someone who naturally struggles with their weight, I wanted to find a supplement which worked in harmony with my body,' she said. 'I use Proactol XS as it has no side effects, is sourced naturally and lets me manage my weight safely. So far I’ve lost around 4lbs a week by taking the supplement.' The tablets contain chitosan, a nondigestible dietary fibre made from the shells of crustaceans and sourced from mushrooms, which promises to neutralise calories from high fat content foods. The chitosan forms a gel-like substance in the stomach, which mixes with the food and removes the fats and cholesterol from it, which is then passed through the body naturally. Shaping up: Mischa is reportedly attempting to slim down ahead of her new movie role. The former OC star currently has seven films in production . Her latest campaign with Proactol XS comes at the same time as reports that Mischa's $7.1m home has been threatened with foreclosure as she owes $100,000 in back payments, according to documents. The former O.C. starlet could lose her $7.1 million Beverly Hills estate if she doesn't pay the $100k in back mortgage payments she owes, according to TMZ. Barton hit her Hollywood peak in the mid-2000s, starring as the sexy Marissa Cooper in 76 episodes of The O.C. After her 2007 D.U.I. arrest and the mental ward hold two years later, Mischa switched gears into fashion with her own line of handbags, cosmetics and clothes. Her London shop, Mischa's Place, sits on in the trendy Spitalfields Market on Brushfield Street. Changing shape: Mischa, pictured, left, this summer and, right, in 2008, has opened up about her rise to fame and says she probably wouldn't do it all again . After her flicker of fame began to fade following the cancellation The O.C. due to poor ratings, Mischa re-tooled her career, taking on several smaller roles on TV and in film. Mischa has 17 projects in development, and seven films currently in production. She made 17 films since 2007, with none grossing more than $38 million. Mischa, who told the British Metro newspaper that she wasn't as grateful for her involvement in the TV hit as she should be, will also head up a nationwide campaign to find Britain's most stylish vaper for e-cigarette brand VAPESTICK. Asked if she would do it all again, Mischa answered 'probably not.' Mischa told Metro: ‘It’s something I came so close to not doing. I had a really great thing with film. People say be grateful for what you have but it certainly not the kind of thing I was expecting it to be… I’ve kind of seen it all.’ Finding fame: Barton, left, hit her Hollywood peak in the mid-2000s, starring as the sexy Marissa Cooper in 76 episodes of The O.C . During her sharp shoot to fame, the actress described herself as 'depressed and overworked' as she began to take on the bad habits of fellow teen stars Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, who have also suffered very public issues with alcohol and partying. ‘It’s tough. It’s really tough when you are young in this business,' she said. 'People blow a lot of hot air at you. That’s the main thing.

"The GOP staffer who called Malia and Sasha Obama classless has resigned today following a storm of outrage over her comments. Elizabeth Lauten wrote a diatribe on Thanksgiving, slamming the First Daughters, aged 16 and 13, for wearing casual clothing and looking sullen during the White House turkey pardon. Today, after thousands of calls for the self-professed media expert to be sacked, Lauten has agreed to resign from her post as communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher of Tennessee. Scroll down for video . Resigned: Elizabeth Lauten has stepped down as communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher after writing this (left) diatribe against Malia and Sasha Obama on Thanksgiving, slamming their attire and attitude . 'Classless': Lauten told the girls to 'dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar' in her Facebook post . Lauten told NBC News by phone on Monday morning that her resignation is already 'in the works,' four days after her controversial post on Facebook went viral. 'Dear Sasha and Malia,' she wrote in the post, 'I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class.' Lauten added: 'Act like being in the White House matters to you. 'Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. 'And certainly don't make faces during televised public events.' Sasha, 13, was dressed in a short maroon dress with a long cream cardigan that matched her thick cream socks, worn over bare legs. Her sister Malia, 16, wore black tights under a mini kilt with a grey and cream jumper. The Obama Administration responded to Lauten's comments on Monday, with White House spokesman Josh Earnest saying he was surprised a congressional staffer would use a Thanksgiving-themed event to criticize the first family. He says individuals who frequently speak publicly tend to be mindful of how their words are perceived. Earnest added that it's common sense that first daughters should be off-limits to criticism. Lauten apologized for her post hours later, writing that 'judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart', saying that 'hours of prayer' had shown the error of her ways. Apology: Hours later she removed the original outburst, issued an apology and set her page to private . The girls' expressions during their father's Thanksgiving address prompted playful comments on social media. After the President had pardoned the designated bird, a four-month-old 49-pounder called Cheese, he asked Malia if she wanted to pet the turkey. 'Nah', she replied, in a rare departure from her usual, gracious disposition, which prompted a flurry of remarks from viewers. But Lauten's reaction sparked outrage. The incident was not Lauten's first social media slip-up. In August, she posted a tweet from her boss's verified Twitter account about 'shagging'. Stephen Fincher's followers were baffled when he tweeted: 'God I love this song. And beach music. AND shagging #pandora,' in reference to an Embers playlist on Pandora radio. Lauten later deleted the post and apologized for the 'accident' - but insisted 'shagging' is a dance term rather than a sexual reference. 'It had nothing to do with Stephen Fincher. I don't think he knows what Pandora is; he certainly doesn't have it,' she said, according to Politico. Following mass outrage to her post on Thursday, Lauten deleted it, set her profile to private, and issued an apology: 'I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager. Reaction: The girls prompted soft criticism for sullenly scowling at their father, the President, on Thanksgiving . Twitter users rushed to defend the girls who Lauten said 'deserve a spot at a bar' rather than the White House . 'After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents and re-reading my words online, I can see more clearly how hurtful my words were. 'Please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no pace in my heart. 'Furthermore, I'd like to apologize to all of those who I have hurt and offended with my words, and pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience.' Over the weekend, Lauten's critics defended Malia and Sasha by tweeting the renowned picture of George W Bush's daughter Jenna drunkenly tumbling over her friend on to the floor of a frat party, cigarette in hand, while her father was in office. The 2001 photo, which earned the then 19-year-old the nickname Jenna And Tonic, went viral with the hash tag '#classy'. Other responses included a picture of the moment Jenna, one of the former president's twin daughters, stuck out her tongue at White House photographers while riding in the presidential limousine. Unimpressed: The First Daughters looked bored and unimpressed by their father's jokes about turkey . Clothing: Sasha wore a maroon dress and cardigan while Malia wore a mini kilt with black tights and boots . 'Awful teenage years': The cyber-bullying post addressed to the young girls said they are at an 'awful' stage . 'Did you forget that jenna bush got photographed at the age of 19 knocking someone over at a FRAT party? good lord,' one Twitter user wrote. Another commented: 'The Bush twins used fake ID's to get into bars. & Jenna Bush stuck out tongue at press. Is that 'classy?' @DCGopGirl #tcot #UniteBlue.' One wrote: 'Where were your ignorant comments on the Palin family brawl, the Bush girls (Jenna & Tonic).' 'So Sasha and Malia Obama have no class? Two words: Jenna Bush. #ElizabethLauten,' one tweet read. And one said: 'I have a feeling that Jenna Bush & sister are a little ticked off at #ElizabethLauten for bringing their past behavior into the spotlight.'","Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican communications director, lashed out at Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, for 'classless' clothes and sullen attitude .

"Laying on the ground amid the wreckage of the Boston Marathon bombings, Sydney Corcoran knew  she faced a long road to recovery.

And having been given that second chance at life, the teen is wasting no time.

But the brave pair were determined that Sydney complete her high school rite of passage despite what they were contending with. 'When I was in the hospital, I didn't . think this was going to be possible and I got to the rehab and, because . I was up and I was doing stuff, it felt more like I could do it. And it . was a goal,' she said. 'She still wanted to help out and she was determined to, so she made sure that she did my toes.' One particularly difficult moment the teen faced was returning to her mom's salon. The shop is in Boston's city center and brought back memories of what happened that day. 'Each time I go in it's scary. The first time, the entire car ride — I just had like flashbacks,' she said. But once she was prepped for the big . night nothing stood in her way and friends, including her boyfriend and . date Tyler Veiga, ensured she had a good time despite the fact she's . still on crutches and is in constant pain. The 18-year-old was reunited with classmates to attend her prom, just six weeks after she was badly injured . Despite her foot being numb and having to use crutches, she was thrilled to attend . 'It means so much to me, and it's not . just in the United States, there's people all over the world that have . reached out to me,” she said. 'See? I'm going to start crying. It’s so touching to me.' The Lowell High School student is set to attend community college this autumn. 'There's some tough days and yesterday I had kind of a down day, but you just get through those days and you just power on, and the next day is another day, and it is prom day. So you can't be sad on prom day,' the teenager told MyFoxBoston.com. After the devastating blast, the Corcoran family received nearly $500,000 in donations from strangers across the world to help pay for the cost of their medical care and rehabilitation. It was another horrifying incident for the family as Sydney cheated death in 2011 when she survived a car accident which left her with a fractured skull. Guidance counselor and family friend Shelby Boisvert told NECN.com that  the event was a majopr milestone for the Corcoran family. 'It’s been a long journey for her and I can’t even imagine what they’ve gone through, but for her this was like her crowning moment,  she really wanted to be here.' Though dancing what still too difficult for the senior last night, she has one other goal in mind. She intends to walk to the podium for her high school graduation.

"At a political event in Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday, President Obama devoted only 40 seconds to the shooting down of the Malaysian airline, his first statement to the world following the news. His emotionless reference to the attack as ‘a terrible tragedy’ seemed disconnected from the horrific moment, particularly as he immediately reverted to script to praise his administration and criticise Republicans. It was a far cry from President Reagan’s 1983 fierce denunciation of the Soviet shooting down of a Korean airliner as a ‘crime against humanity’. Scroll down for video . Response: President Obama's emotionless reference to the attack as ‘a terrible tragedy’ seemed disconnected from the horrific moment . But it only confirmed the chaos into which US foreign policy has descended since the summer of 2012 when reporters at a White House briefing asked Mr Obama about the security of chemical weapons in the Syrian stockpile. The commander in chief went beyond safety and said: ‘We have been very clear to the Assad regime … that a red line for us is [when] we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilised.’ The term ‘red line’ is the kind of clear, emphatic language major powers use only when they are prepared to back words with action. A little over a year later, the Assad regime utilised chemical weapons against its own people. The number of blunders that the President and his administration committed in the ‘red line’ affair is hard to fathom. Before the President spoke, no one vetted the term and its consequences in the White House policy process and, once the words came out, no one undertook preparations in case Syrian president Bashar al-Assad called Mr Obama’s bluff. According to reports, no one made the diplomatic rounds to line up the support of allies just in case, or the congressional rounds to line up the support of Congress. No one developed military plans or sent quiet signals to Assad that the US was not to be trifled with on this matter. These actions are routine when any White House makes as definitive a commitment as the President made, except, apparently, this White House. Even bigger blunders came after the Syrian chemical attack. Mr Obama began signalling that, despite his remark, he did not want a response, any response. First there was the verification charade. Multiple eyewitness accounts of rockets rising out of Syrian army installations and falling into the stricken zones at the time of the chemical attacks were not enough to warrant quick action. Then there was his call for a congressional vote, delivered just when the need to respond was most urgent if air strikes were to deliver an effective message. Back to politics: He immediately reverted to script to praise his administration and criticise Republicans . Finally, there was the utter failure to attract congressional support, assuming Mr Obama really wanted Congress to endorse the proposed attacks. That the Parliament of our closest ally, Great Britain, rejected an air campaign first gave Mr Obama an additional reason for inactivity. The flailing seemed to end when Russian President Vladimir Putin opened the door to a negotiated deal with Syria. But it was not the end; it was the beginning. For as the administration rushed to that door, all over the world those who depended on America when in harrowing circumstances were asking themselves: How reliable is America now? How strong now? Also asking was Mr Putin. He noted the contrast between Mr Obama’s bold talk and timid response. As the former head of a friendly government said in a small meeting I attended not long ago: ‘Putin is cautious. He will probe. If he encounters resistance, he will pull back.’ The US failure to follow through in Syria gave the Russian president confidence that he could move with impunity. SOON he was picking a fight with Ukraine. Like the scene in The Godfather – when, at his child’s baptism, Michael Corleone renounces the devil as the camera cuts back and forth to his men eliminating rival gangsters – Putin, before global television cameras, watched the opening ceremonies of the Sochi Olympics as Russian troops began movements preparatory to seizing Crimea. This week, in the skies over Ukraine, we saw the consequences of the recklessness that the Russian godfather’s probing has unleashed. Putin was not the only one to detect opportunity in American indecision. China stepped up its probes in the East and South China Seas. In the Middle East, with the US military presence drawn down nearly to zero in Iraq and soon Afghanistan, an army of ruthless fanatics gestating unnoticed in Syria’s east saw the chance to break out of national boundaries and within a few weeks occupied much of western and central Iraq. Why has so much of the global order come apart so fast? For the same reason that, as a friend reports, on the streets of San Salvador those who will smuggle your child to the Rio Grande have been securing an unprecedented volume of sign-ups. When asked about the chances of the child staying in America once the border is crossed, they tell parents: ‘It has never been easier.’ Now the word on weakness is everywhere, even the poorest barrios of Central America. Consequences: The current White House doesn’t understand how US fecklessness in Syria can reverberate to Ukraine . ‘The fact that you have a crisis in Ukraine has nothing to do with Gaza,’ a deputy national security adviser to the President told an interviewer recently. The current White House doesn’t understand how US fecklessness in Syria can reverberate to Ukraine, and from there to the South China Sea, and the Americas, and Gaza and elsewhere in the Middle East. In all this I have referred to the United States as the primary shaper of world events, which is, in fact, a misleading shorthand. The US is not a superpower so much as the biggest player in a set of super-alliances, the most critical of which is with the UK. Since the Second World War, when the US and Britain have been of one mind, liberal values have been secure and even advanced. When either has lost its sense of direction, neither has been nearly so effective. The great danger in being the anchor to the global order is that when we lose our way the general peace itself is threatened. This is just what we are seeing in theatre after theatre around the world. Perhaps it is time for a key ally like Prime Minister David Cameron to have a friendly talk with the President. It is not just American interests that a flailing White House threatens. It is that of peoples everywhere.","Clark S. Judge believes Obama's reaction to the tragedy was 'disconnected'

"Tim Cook took over the company shortly after Steve Jobs died of cancer in October 2011 . Apple chief executive Tim Cook has told climate-change deniers they should not buy shares in the company.

"A dangerous shrimp that could decimate British waterways has been found in the UK. The killer crustacean - branded a 'voracious predator' by the Environment Agency has been found in the Worcester and Birmingham canal following previous sighting in the River Severn. It arrived in the UK from Eastern Europe, and feeds on fish, sparking fears it could dramatically change the UK's delicate marine ecosystem. Public enemy number one: The 'killer shrimp' that could decimate Britain's waterways. The Environment Agency today issued a high alert warning people to look out for it. Adults are up to 30mm in length. The body is curled and semi-transparent. They have two pairs of antennae and large, powerful mandibles. Newly hatched young are about 1.8mm in length and resemble adults. According to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, . the killer shrimp is 'a voracious predator' that 'kills a range of . native species, including young fish, and can significantly alter . ecosystems'. Regarding its cousin, the Environment Agency says it is 'uncertain at this stage what its impact might be'. Experts have scrambled a team of investigators dedicated to tracking the shrimps’ movements and how quickly they are spreading throughout the country. The Environment Agency’s Area Manager for Worcs, David Throup, said; 'We are concerned that this invasive species has been found in the Midlands. 'We now have a dedicated team whose focus is to establish the degree of the problem, and whether the shrimp has spread wider than the locations already found.

"Shocked: The Duke of Cambridge was said to be 'appalled' at the 'senseless' killing . Prince William has been left 'appalled' by the slaughter of his friend's rhino which was killed by poachers for his prized horn. Endangered white rhinoceros Max was shot 17 times and had his horn hacked off by hunters in Kenya. Despite rangers removing most of his horn as a protective measure against poachers, he was hunted for the small piece still remaining. Six-year-old Max, who was featured in the documentary Last Chance To See, had been hand-reared by Ian Craig - the father of Prince William's ex-girlfriend Jecca. Mr Craig owns the Lewa wildlife reserve in Kenya but the animal had been moved to the Ol Pejeta sanctuary after he reached adulthood, which is where the killing took place. In 2001 the Duke of Cambridge spent six weeks volunteering at Mr Craig's conservation project and he met Max several times on later trips to Africa. It was after his seeing Mr Craig's work with rhinos that Prince William became a patron of the Tusk Trust, which works to protect the animals. A St James's . Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke of Cambridge is appalled to hear about . this senseless slaughter. He remains very concerned about rhino and . elephant poaching and has asked Tusk Trust to keep him updated on this . issue in Africa.' Poachers kill rhino for their horns, which sell for £40,00 a kilo in Asia where it is wrongly believed to cure cancer. Charlie Mayhew, co-founder of the Tusk Trust, said: 'Max's . slaughter by poachers is a shocking illustration of what is now . happening the length and breadth of Africa to meet the growing demand . for rhino horn in China and Vietnam. 'The . fact that this rhino had been hand reared at Lewa meant that many . visitors to Lewa including our Royal Patron had the opportunity to get . extremely close to him. It of course makes it all the more shocking and . sad when you know the individual animal that has been poached. Slaughtered: Max, who was hand-reared by Prince William's friend Ian Craig, was found shot and with his horn cut out . Butchered: Despite the fact that most of Max's prized horn had already been removed to protect him from poachers, he was killed for the remainder of it . 'When Max grew up, he was moved to another sanctuary where he was killed. 'The . Prince has taken a very close interest in the escalation of rhino and . elephant poaching and it is something he feels passionate about trying . to halt this illegal trade.' Mr Mayhew added that the problem of rhino-poaching was now 'pan-Africa' and said that one reserve he spent time at in Zimbabwe had lost six rhinos so far this year. He said: 'Last . year in South Africa alone they were losing on average a rhino every 20 . hrs to poachers. This year South Africa has already lost more than 70. 'It . is a real crisis and one that Tusk along with a number of other . organisations is desperately trying to tackle.

"Banking giant JPMorgan Chase was forced into a humiliating climbdown over its plans to hold a question-and-answer session on Twitter today after receiving a barrage of abusive tweets. The bank had arranged an event where top executive Jimmy Lee would field questions from users in what it hoped would be a positive public relations stunt. But the company said it had scrapped the session after being flooded with insults, confirming the decision with the matter-of-fact tweet: 'Tomorrow's Q&A is cancelled. Bad Idea. Back to the drawing board.' Humiliating: Banking giant JPMorgan confirms it has cancelled a planned Q&A on Twitter with a top executive after receiving thousands of abusive tweets over its role in the global recession . Backfired: Banker Jimmy Lee had been lined up to field questions in what the firm hoped would be a positive public relations stunt . Under-fire: The banking group, headed by CEO Jamie Dimon (pictured), faces a $13billion fine over over alleged misdeeds in the financial meltdown . JPMorgan last week asked users of the popular microblogging site to send questions marked with the hashtag #AskJPM in advance of the session set for Thursday at 1pm in New York. Few questions appeared until Wednesday afternoon when responses started piling in. Some users simply made fun of the bank's attempt to use social media, but many others chose to insult executives or ask barbed questions about bank's recent legal problems and corporate responsibility. 'Reading the #AskJPM Twitter feed makes it seem JPM put a 'kick me' sticker on its back when it rolled out that hashtag,' wrote a user who identified himself as an editor and columnist. A woman who said she was a community organiser and 'next gen freedom fighter' asked if Lee, a vice chairman and deal rainmaker at the bank, thought it was 'ok to outright lie, cheat and steal.' Meanwhile, one user asked: 'What's it like working Mexican drug cartels? Do they tip?' Venting their spleen: Some angry tweets directed at JPMorgan ahead of the planned Q&A session on Twitter . Another posted a picture of a whale spewing bank notes from its blowhole in reference to the 'London Whale' trading scandal for which JPMorgan was fined nearly £600million. A woman called Charlotte mocked the bank's attempt at social media outreach as an 'epic derailment' and asked: 'Is it true that, while you don't always spit on poor people, when you do, you have perfect aim?' A blogger and online journalist asked about the scale of the bank's alleged wrongdoing in electric energy trading compared with that in its sales of mortgage securities. Another user known as 'Guerrilla Educator' asked if anyone in Lee's family had ever been foreclosed upon. The company's tweets last week said Lee had been part of Wall Street's biggest deals and had worked with Dell Inc and General Motors Co. The tweets said Lee would 'answer your questions on leadership and life.' It comes as the bank braces itself for a record $13billion (£8billion) fine over its role in the global slump. Satirical: One user posted this drawing which makes reference to the 'London Whale' trading scandal for which JPMorgan was fined £570million . Read it and weep: More than 66 per cent of the 80,000 tweets sent using the haghtag #AskJPM were apparently negative . It relates to the selling of sophisticated investments based on ‘high-risk’ home loans which resulted in the near collapse of the banking system in 2008. The penalty will be the biggest so far paid by a bank over alleged misdeeds in the financial meltdown that has plunged the world’s economy into the deepest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The problems relate to ‘mortgage-backed securities’ created by investment banks in the run-up to the credit crisis. Problems came when the US housing market ran into trouble and it emerged that some of these securities, that had purported to contain top quality mortgages, were in fact stuffed with sub-prime loans to borrowers who could not afford to repay. JPMorgan is accused of selling these products knowing that many of the loans involved were high-risk. The latest fine comes after the bank paid out a £570million penalty in the UK and admitted wrongdoing in the £4billion ‘London Whale’ trading scandal. That settlement included a £137.6m fine from British watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, the second biggest penalty ever from the UK regulators. The rest went to US authorities. In the London Whale affair, a group of traders in the firm’s Chief Investment Office based in London made huge bets on complex financial instruments and covered up their losses for months. One trader, Frenchman Bruno Iksil, was nicknamed the London Whale due to the size of his bets. The bank said it has placed a total of $23billion (£14bn) in reserve to cover its possible legal costs.","Firm had planned public relations stunt with senior executive Jimmy Lee .

"Four men were miraculously found alive after a landslide buried them alive on a construction site in China . Two of the builders had been buried in the trench for over two hours when firefighters pulled them out on Wednesday afternoon. The accident happened in Shaoyang County, southern China's Hunan province when two builders working on the site were buried in a mudslide. Stuck in: Firefighters tread carefully as they free one of the men so as not to set off another landslide . When the construction team sent two workers to rescue them, they too were caught in a second slide. Firefighters were called to the scene and after two hours, all four workers were found unharmed. This is the latest in a long line of work related accidents in China as a result of its notoriously slack health and safety regulations, some of which have had deadly outcomes. In September, 19 workers died on a construction site in Wuhan, central China when a lift cable snapped, causing it to fall 30 floors.

"Police are probing whether a glamorous Russian model was killed by her photographer husband because she infected him with AIDS. The naked body of 28-year-old Yulia Loshagina was found in woodland in the Ural mountains in Russia, her neck broken and face disfigured by burning. Her wounds were so severe that her body could only be identified by DNA. Scroll down for video . Fairytale romance: Dmitry Loshagin and Yulia Loshagina met on a photo shoot in India and he proposed on the spot . Her photographer husband, Dmitry Loshagin, 37, was arrested in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth largest city. He is currently being held as police investigate whether he was involved in the gruesome murder following a rooftop party at their £1million loft penthouse. Other guests who were at the party reported that Loshagina appeared to become distressed. Detectives said postmortem tests showed that the dead model was HIV positive, according to Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. 'One version is that Dmitry Loshagin became so furious when he learned that his wife infected him with AIDS that he killed her. Police are investigating if this version is correct,' reported the newspaper. He told a judge at a hearing in Pervouralsk - after which his remand in custody was renewed - that the accusations against him are 'baseless' and he denied any guilt in her murder. 'I loved my wife,' he said. Allure: This picture of Yulia was taken by her husband Dmitry, who said he first fell in love with her when he photographed her in a wedding dress . Married bliss: Loshagin told his wife 'I want to grow old with you' and his friends say it is 'impossible' that he killed her . Unconfirmed local reports say investigators found evidence that his mobile phone was registered close to where her body was found at a lonely sport 23 miles west of the Yekaterinburg. Her tragic end is a far cry from the love affair between the leading local photographer - known for his pictures of Urals oligarchs - and one of the region's most prominent models. They fell in love on a shoot in India when he photographed her in a bridal dress - and proposed on the spot. The couple wed two years ago. 'When I saw her in a wedding dress on the back of an elephant in the Indian jungle, I went to her and proposed,"" he previously disclosed. ''I want to look at the world through your eyes', I said to her then. Top model: Yulia quickly became her husband's favourite subject for photo shoots . 'I want to grow old with you, and I want to walk on the beach and hold your hand.' She agreed instantly and has since become his favourite model, with many of his pictures of her appearing in Russian glossy magazines. Yulia disappeared on 22 August and her frantic family launched an immediate search, calling friends and acquaintances. Despite her absence, say her relatives, he continued working normally. Yulia's brother Mikhail, said: ""He simply didn't bother to start looking for her. First he told us that Yulia left in the middle of the night, taking his car. Then he claimed that his car suddenly re-appeared under their window. Behind the scenes: Friends who were at the party the night Yulia disappeared said she seemed very distressed and locked her husbands and guests out on the roof . 'I got simply fed up and went to police, claiming my sister disappeared and we suspected had something happened to her. 'He constantly changes his story. He didn't think to call police to check the car which Yulia allegedly took for fingerprints. Why?  He refuses to take a polygraph test. I think it means he's got things to hide.' At the party, she had locked her husband and other guests on the roof until a janitor released them. When her body was found several days after she went missing, Mikhail claimed he was too busy to go and identify her. Mikhail claimed that he texted: 'Busy, at picture presentation right now.' In the days after her death, he put their penthouse flat in Yekaterinburg on sale for £1 million. He was arrested as he sought to leave 'on a business trip', confirmed police. 'Police will do everything in our power to find the murderer as soon as possible,"" said a source. 'We detained Yulia's husband. He has not been charged with murder, but we are investigating if he could have been involved.' His supporters say it is 'impossible' that he killed her and are demanding his release. He once said of her: 'I really love the partnership I have with Yulia. I know I can 100 per cent rely on her. Whatever happens to me, I know she will come and pick me up, however deep I sink.'

"A planet which really does twinkle like a diamond in the sky has been discovered by scientists - its surface is littered with the precious stones. The planet - called 55 Cancri e - has a radius double the size of Earth’s, and weighs eight times more. Whilst Earth’s surface is covered in water and granite, the new planet is thought to be covered in diamonds and graphite. An artist's impression of the 'diamond planet' twice the size of Earth . The planet-hosting star 55 Cancri in the constellation of Cancer. The star is visible to the naked eye, although researchers say it is easier to find through binoculars. For the exact location, see the sky map below. A new study estimates that at least a third of the planet’s mass - the equivalent of the weight of three Earths - could be diamond. This is the first time astronomers have identified a likely diamond planet around a sun-like star and unearthed its chemical make-up. 'This is our first glimpse of a rocky world with a fundamentally different chemistry from Earth,' said lead researcher Nikku Madhusudhan. 'The surface of this planet is likely covered in graphite and diamond rather than water and granite.' The diamond planet orbits at hyper speed - its year lasts just 18 hours, in contrast to Earth’s 365 days. But with a blazingly hot temperature of about 3,900F, researchers say it will not live on. It one of five planets orbiting a sun-like star, 55 Cancri, that is located 40 light years from Earth yet visible to the naked eye in the constellation of Cancer. The planet was first observed orbiting its star last year, allowing astronomers to measure its radius for the first time. This new information, combined with the most recent estimate of its mass, allowed Madhusudhan and colleagues to determine its chemical make-up. Star map showing the planet-hosting star 55 Cancri in the constellation of Cancer. The star is visible to the naked eye, though better through binoculars. Research suggests the planet has no water at all, and appears to be composed mainly of carbon (as graphite and diamond), iron, silicon carbide, and, possibly, some silicates. 'By contrast, Earth’s interior is rich in oxygen, but extremely poor in carbon - less than a part in thousand by mass,' says co-author and Yale geophysicist Kanani Lee. The identification of a carbon-rich super-Earth means that distant rocky planets can no longer be assumed to have compositions similar to that of Earth. David Spergel, professor of astronomy and chair of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University, said: 'This ‘diamond-rich super-Earth’ is likely just one example of the rich sets of discoveries that await us as we begin to explore planets around nearby stars.' The paper reporting the findings has been accepted for publication in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.","55 Cancrie e visible with the naked eye from Earth .

"Facebook is developing its own in-house equivalent to Snapchat, the controversial photo messaging app that has been accused of promoting 'sexting' among youngsters. Snapchat allows users to send pictures with a time limit - meaning that they automatically delete themselves after a predetermined time has elapsed. The messaging service has reportedly become popular for sending flirtatious pictures, with recipients unable to hang on to the embarrassing evidence and leak it online. Onward march of the search giant: Facebook is reportedly gearing up to release its own Snapchat-like service, despite fears the app could be promoting promiscuous behaviour among youngsters . Snapchat's homepage: The messaging service has reportedly become popular for sending flirtatious pictures, with recipients unable to hang on to the embarrassing evidence and leak it online . However, it has come under fire for . promising more privacy than it can guarantee, since it remains possible . to take a screengrab of the picture before it self destructs. Facebook, the world's most popular social network, reportedly plans to launch its own Snapchat-like service in the coming weeks, before the end of the year. The new app will be standalone and separate from the main Facebook app, AllthingsD reports, bringing the social network's app count up to four including Messenger and Camera - five if you count Instagram. Snapchat has risen to notoriety over the past year with many commentators accusing the service of promoting irresponsible sexual behaviour among teenagers. Launched in September 2011, it was reportedly inspired by the the humiliation of New York politician Anthony Weiner, who was caught sending explicit pictures of himself to a woman online. The service allows users to send pictures to a recipient, while stipulating a time limit during which they can view the images. This would allow a user to send a . naked picture to another, but give the recipient, say, only five minutes . in which to view it before it automatically erases itself. Check this out: There are fears that Snapchat's claims at enhancing the security of picture messaging could encourage youngsters to send explicit pictures in the mistaken belief that they cannot be captured and shared . Facebook could use location metadata to make money from Instagram, the cult photosharing service it acquired for $715million in September. There have been rumours adverts would soon appear on Instagram's thus far uncluttered user interface but a senior executive for the social network would recently only confirm plans to 'monetise Instagram'. Facebook's vice president of global marketing Carolyn Everson told Business Insider: 'Instagram continues to grow incredibly fast and we're still a very small team when you think about the amount of people they are reaching. 'There are many brands that use Instagram right now to try to get a feel for how to engage with their followers. We will definitely be figuring out a monetisation strategy. 'When that will happen, I can't comment, but it's going to happen.' Ms Everson pointedly avoided confirming that adverts would appear on the service, implying that the company may choose to use the wealth of data about Instagram's users to make money. All photos uploaded from users' mobile phones contain geotagged location data that reveals exactly where the picture was taken. That, combined with Facebook's own facial recognition technology, gives the company a rich seam of data to mine. According to The Next Web, recent policy changes within the company mean that Instagram user data can be directly passed on to Facebook's corporate customers. The Next Web comments: 'Facebook could just clutter Instagram with ads, but why would it ever risk that when Instagram can instead serve as a data miner’s wet dream?' Given the nature of the service, even Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel has acknowledged it seems inevitable to be used for explicit pictures, admitting: 'The minute you tell someone that images on your server disappear, everyone jumps to sexting.' Facebook's version of the app offers pretty much the same service, allowing users to send messages to others that are viewable only for a set period. The move to come up with their own Snapchat-like app is just the latest in a string of aggressive moves by Facebook to dominate the friend-to-friend communications market, AllthingsD says. It's just a fortnight since the social network giant updated its Messenger app for Android to allow people without a Facebook account to send messages, in what was seen as an attempt to challenge to messaging service WhatsApp. The new service is likely to further worry parents who see the proliferation of Snapchat-like services as a potential lure to underage children to distribute explicit pictures of themselves. The website for the now controversial app features two young, pretty girls and the downloadable program is described as being rated for users over 12 years due in part to 'mild sexual content or nudity.' However, despite Snapchat's glossy promise to make photo retention harder than before, it has been shown that the program is not foolproof and is open to abuse. When a user attempts to take a screenshot of another person's picture, Snapchat automatically notifies the sender but it does not stop the recipient from taking a screenshot nor can it prevent another phone or camera taking a picture of the original image. This has led to worries that the files sent via the service could nonetheless find their way on to the Internet where the original sender quickly loses control of who can get their hands on the explicit images. Mr Spiegel has denied that his social media tool could promote sexting among youngsters. 'I’m not convinced that the whole sexting thing is as big as the media makes it out to be,' he said. 'I just don’t know people who do that. It doesn’t seem that fun when you can have real sex.' Nevertheless, he has told BuzzFeed that the Snapchat team is 'trying to do a better job educating our users and their parents,' and that he was looking to add more guidance materials to their website soon.","Like Snapchat, the new Facebook service out by the end of the year would allow users to send picture messages with a time limit .
However the Snapchat service has come under fire amid claims it encourages youngsters to send sexually explicit pictures .
It has been shown that Snapchat pictures can be screengrabbed, meaning that the service does not offer the privacy it seems to claim ."
"Basketball legend Charles Barkley has told how he once gained 20lbs in 48 hours to avoid being selected by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1984 NBA draft. The 51-year-old revealed on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that he didn't want to play for the team because they were only paying $75,000 for a one-year deal and he didn't leave college early to be 'poor'. In a bid to make himself undesirable before the drafting, he ate two Grand Slam breakfasts from Denny's totaling 1,660 calories, went to lunch at Red Lobster gobbling down every hush puppy in sight, and  feasted on two T-bone steaks for dinner. Scroll down for video . Weight gain: Basketball legend Charles Barkley, 51, has told how he once put on 20lbs in 48 hours to avoid being selected by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1984 NBA draft . He then repeated the menu the following day before flying to Philadelphia for his final weigh-in. After his non-stop feeding session Barkley managed to bulk up his 6ft 6in frame to 302lbs. The mass of salty, fried food is likely to have caused water retention and subsequent weight gain. However, the sport star's trick failed to turn off NBA managers and he landed a spot with the Philadelphia 76ers. Recalling the moment he found out he had been picked by the team, he told Fallon: 'I said, ""oh hell no, now I'm fat and poor.""'

Flashback: Barkley gets ready to dunk during a game for the Philadelphia's 76ers in 1992 . Barkley went on to play for the team for eight years and was ranked one of the top players on court. He later moved to the Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets before retiring in 2000 to take up TV sports commentary. On hanging up his basketball vest, Barkley gained a noticeable 100lbs. 'I come from Alabama, a state that has struggled with obesity for years. I mean it is the heart of the South - we love food.' Barkley said at the time.

"Taylor Armstrong did not contact police over alleged abuse 'to protect daughter' In the days leading up to his death, friends family of Russell Armstrong have revealed he was deeply concerned about how he was being portrayed on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. And now scathing comments about show bosses Armstrong made in one of the last interviews conducted have emerged. 'Everything you see on that show is bull****,' he said. 'Those Bravo b*****ds take every little argument out of context and magnify it for the cameras.' 'Evil': In one of the last interviews conducted before his death, Russell Armstrong called TV network Bravo 'bastards' for their portrayal of him on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills . Speaking exclusivity to TheFix.com, Armstrong added: 'The Russell you see on TV has nothing to do with my real personality. 'He's just a stock character created by Bravo's evil overlords. That's not me you see up there. It's just a character I play on TV.' Last week Armstrong's 69-year-old mother John Ann Hotchkiss threatened the network with legal action if they proceed with plans to air footage of her son. She told Headline News: 'Before the new . season even started, before he took his life, he said, ""Mom, they’re . just going to crucify me this season"".' 'That's not me': Armstrong said of his onscreen portrayal, 'He's just a stock character created by Bravo's evil overlords' 'He said, ""I don’t know what to do. I’ll never survive it"".' She has also said that the TV network: 'Better not air one frame of my son... or else!' During his TheFix.com interview, the businessman appeared to change his tune at one point. 'At first I was a little annoyed about all the bull****, but then I realised it's not so bad to be a celebrity,' he said. 'The thing is, all the publicity has been great for my business.' Armstrong's statement is contrary to the widespread reports that he was in hot water financially at the time of his death. Legal action: Armstrong's mother has threatened Bravo not to show any footage of her son in the upcoming season of Real Housewives . In the interview Russell also appeared to deny the highly-publicised rift with his wife Taylor, whom he was estranged from. 'She is the most sensitive, sweet woman I've ever met. Taylor's kind of like an angel,' he told TheFix.com. 'She really is everything to me. 'We watch these stories about our terrible marriage, and we lie in bed and laugh. The truth is we are really, really happy.' Representatives for Bravo are yet to respond to Mail Online's request for comment on Armstrong's claims. 'She an angel;': Despite being estranged from his wife, Russell sang Taylor's praises and said all was well in their marriage . Armstrong was found dead last Monday after hanging himself at a home he was staying at on Mulholland Drive. Mail Online revealed on Saturday that John Ann Hotchkiss will not be attending the planned memorial service for her son in LA this Wednesday  after tension with Taylor Armstrong boiled over. Instead she will remember her son at a . separate memorial service, which is due to be held next week as well, in . either Evergreen or Benton, Texas, just outside of Houston. Meanwhile, sources close to the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast have claimed that Taylor failed to go to the police over her husband's alleged abuse because she wanted to protect their daughter Kennedy. 'She said that she didn't want Kennedy to know and she knew that Russell would never harm their daughter,' the source told Radar Online. 'Kennedy would hear them yelling behind closed doors but she didn't witness any violence.' Do you have a story about a celebrity?

"Kent Haruf passed away yesterday at the age of 71 following a battle with cancer . Writer Kent Haruf, who wrote 'Plainsong' and several other novels set in small town Colorado, died yesterday at the age of 71. Haruf's editor at Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, Gary Fisketjon, confirmed Haruf's death and a spokesman for the company said that the writer had been battling cancer. Haruf, who spent 30 years teaching English and writing, is survived by his wife, Cathy, and three daughters. His last novel, 'Our Souls at Night,' will be published next year. Mr Fisketjon said: 'Kent had finished all his revisions and even gone through the copy editing,' Fisketjon said. 'We had it scheduled for May, though I haven't yet processed how this tragic news might alter those plans.' Haruf was a preacher's son who grew up in a family of book lovers. He attended Nebraska Wesleyan University, spent two years in the Peace Corps in Turkey and returned to the U.S. to fine-tune his fiction at the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop. His first novel, 'The Tie That Binds', was published in 1984 and won a Whiting Writers' Prize and was a runner-up for the PEN/Hemingway award for first fiction. His next book, 'Where You Once Belonged,' came out six years later. His most recent novel, 2013's 'Benediction', was on the short list for this year's Folio Prize. Many of Haruf's novels were set in the fictional small town of Holt, Colorado, a composite of the three Colorado towns where he grew up. Knopf said in a statement that the town was 'one of the truly indelible places in American literature'. Haruf's first novel, 'The Tie That Binds', was published in 1984 and won a Whiting Writers' Prize and was a runner-up for the PEN/Hemingway award for first fiction; his last novel will be published next year . 'Plainsong' is based in Holt, and its narrative circulates among a variety of local residents. Haruf was an admirer of Sherwood Anderson's 'Winesburg, Ohio,' which has a similar structure. Haruf would credit the works of Hemingway and Faulkner for changing his life. Hemingway's style inspired Haruf to write cleanly and directly. From Faulkner, Haruf felt he had been granted license to take his stories out of the city. Haruf was a resident of Salida, Colorado.","Haruf's first novel, 'The Tie That Binds', won a Whiting Writers' Prize .

"Senator Rand Paul was spotted hobnobbing at a party in the Hamptons last weekend after he claimed he could not attend a high-profile conservative event he was listed as a sponsor of because he had a 'family commitment.' Paul told the Family Leader he had to skip the group's annual summit on Saturday because he had to attend an event in New York with his family. The presumed 2016 presidential candidate's absence at the influential Iowa gathering was called into question, however, after the New York Post reported that Paul and his wife, Kelley, attended the East Hampton Library fundraiser that day. BUSTED! Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, left, Senator Rand Paul, right, and Paul's wife Kelley, center, were spotted at a fundraiser in East Hampton on Saturday night after Paul ditched a high-profile conservative event he was a sponsor of because he had a 'family commitment' An aide to Paul told The Des Moines Registrar that Paul was indeed in New York for a family event, which Paul, his wife Kelley and one of their sons attended. The Hamptons party was a bonus stop, the staffer claimed. 'We have some friends up here,' Paul told Bloomberg Businessweek of his visit to the Hamptons. 'They invited us to meet some of their . friends.' The Pauls spent the weekend in Hampton Bays with family friend and Hachette Book Group executive editor Kate Hartson. Hartson is the publisher of Kelley Paul's upcoming book, and she has worked with both Rand and his father Ron in the past. Hartson told Bloomberg that she and Kelley worked on photos for her book during the trip. Bloomberg reports that Hartson also took the Pauls on a boat tour, and the trio went fishing in Montauk. It was another Hachette author, Nelson DeMille, who reportedly invited the Pauls to the library fundraiser, which was co-sponsored by actor Alec Baldwin. The 10th annual Authors Night Benefit was held at Gardiner Farm in East Hampton and attracted approximately 1,000 attendees. Doug Stafford, Paul's political adviser, told the Registrar that the Pauls dropped by the fundraiser at the request of Hartson. At the party Paul was photographed yucking it up with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and other members of the New York elite. Author Nelson DeMille, Sandy D., Hachette Book Group executive Kate Hartson, Rand Paul and Kelley Paul pose for a photo at the East Hampton Library Authors Night at Gardiner Farm on Saturday. An aide to Paul says the Senator and his wife stopped by the event at the request of Hartson, the publisher of Kelley's upcoming book, but it was not the purpose of their trip to New York . Bob Vander Plaats, president of the Family Leader, an evangelical Christian group, indicated to the Registrar that he was not impressed with Paul's behavior last weekend. 'From my perspective, there are always choices to be made of where do . you want to be and what message do you want to send,' he said. 'If you want to be at a fundraiser in the Hamptons with the rich . and famous, you probably ought to tell people you want to be at a . fundraiser in the Hamptons with the rich and famous.' After the brouhaha over Paul's weekend plans erupted, the Registrar says Paul's staff contacted the Family . Leader chief to reemphasize that the Senator did not miss the group's event to attend . the Hamptons fundraiser. 'I guess I can understand as [my wife] Darla and I have a family commitment in . New York beginning tomorrow,' Vander Plaats said afterward. The Family Leadership Summit - which drew 1,200 attendees this year - is considered a must-attend event for presidential hopefuls courting the right. Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum - both of whom are openly considering 2016 presidential runs - made the mecca to Iowa for the event. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also appeared at the summit. The three men are considered possible presidential candidates, as well. As a consolation prize for attendees . hoping to meet Paul in person at the Family Leadership Summit, the . Kentucky lawmaker had event organizers play a video compilation of his . pro-life speeches. And while Paul did not attend Saturday's event, he did spend the first three three days of last week barnstorming the Hawkeye State, wooing conservative groups and headlining fundraisers for Republican candidates.","Paul told the Family Leader he had to skip the group's annual summit - of which he was a sponsor - for a family event in New York .

"The FA are refusing to say why they are investigating last summer’s £15million transfer of England international Calum Chambers from Southampton to Arsenal. The surprising probe for a deal that went through with no problems from either Premier League club follows a complaint made to the FA by, it is believed, a disgruntled third party to the deal. Both clubs are aware the FA are looking into the transaction but do not know why. The negotiations were amicable and handled directly by Les Reed of Southampton and Arsenal’s Dick Law. Calum Chambers' £15million move from Southampton to Arsenal will be probed by the FA . Chambers in conversation with his manager Arsene Wenger (left) during a training session . Asked whether he was happy with the transfer, Wenger on Friday said: 'Yes, I am very happy about his transfer. I made over 350 transfers since I am here. We have a lot of enquiries about them and we never had any problem.' Suggestions of agents unrest would not normally be enough to warrant this type of FA attention. Chambers is on the books of Cassius Sports Management, whose agent Alan Middleton, a licensed lawyer, refused to return frequent calls because a legal colleague said it was company policy not to talk to the press. Cassius’s head of talent ID and player recruitment is Steve Moss, who is also Chambers’s stepfather. But there is nothing to stop an agency employing one of their client’s family. Chambers began his career at Southampton before his move to the Emirates Stadium last summer . The issue is said by former team-mates of Chambers to lie somewhere with Arsenal, but a club spokesman said on Thursday: ‘Everything was open, cordial and above board with Southampton throughout the Calum Chambers transfer.’ The FA will not comment about any compliance department activity. Mark Pougatch will have ITV’s two most high-profile pundits with him in the studio when he makes his debut as axed Adrian Chiles’s successor for the Champions League game between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea on Tuesday week. Mark Pougatch has replaced Adrian Chiles as football presenter on ITV . Roy Keane, after leaving his role as assistant manager at Aston Villa, will be returning as an ITV analyst on a game-by-game basis and will have his former Manchester United team-mate Paul Scholes alongside. Neither of them hold back with their often scathing opinions, which will give new presenter Pougatch a testing environment for his first game. Keane’s demeanour will be fascinating as in the past his body language alone has shown what he thinks about daft questions from Chiles. Paul Scholes and Roy Keane will team up again as pundits for ITV's Champions League coverage . Leading football agent Rob Segal has lost another of his big-name players to Aidy Ward, who is leaving Impact Sports Management to set up on his own. Following the defection of Raheem Sterling and Saido Barahino, Arsenal have been informed that England’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will now be represented by Ward and Alex’s father Mark, who also played for England. Raheem Sterling is all smiles during a Liverpool training session held on Thursday at Melwood . Saido Berahino in action for West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League against Everton last month . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain battles with Glenn Whelan of Stoke during the Premier League clash last month . The astonishment that has greeted Manchester United paying former manager Sir Alex Ferguson £2million a year for 20 days of ambassador work, first revealed by Sports Agenda, will be that much more with the knowledge the contract is open ended. This allows Fergie to carry out such lucrative £100,000-a-day engagements for as long as he wants. The club view is Fergie’s achievements at Old Trafford warrant such largesse. Sir Alex Fergusn is being paid £2million a year for 20 days of ambassador work by Manchester United . Virgin threat derailed . The Premier League have played down the threat of Virgin Media’s complaint about the TV match selling process to broadcast regulators Ofcom — who have dismissed their attempts to derail today’s rights bids deadline. But the issue was concern enough to be discussed at length at yesterday’s club summit, with chairmen worried about where regulatory intervention is going to strike next. Club meetings are often a foreign-owner free zone but at least Liverpool’s Tom Werner was there on Thursday, while Sunderland’s Ellis Short has replaced David Gill on the audit and remuneration committee that will select the next Premier League chairman. Dave Jones, Sky Sports football presenter, is to become an executive director of League Two Oxford United. His colleague Jeff Stelling is president of Hartlepool but hopefully Jones will not plug his allegiance on air as often as Stelling bangs on about struggling Hartlepool. Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling is a well-known Hartlepool fan as well as president at the club . Peter Alliss, who has made clear his upset at BBC losing live Open golf coverage, is one pundit that Sky are not interested in signing when they take over the rights in 2017. Alliss will be 86 by then and will surely call it a day after the Troon Open in 2016, if not at St Andrews this year.

"A vast shipyard which is larger than a football pitch and built ships for Roman emperors, including Hadrian, has been discovered by British archaeologists. Experts from the University of Southampton, among others, excavated the remains of a building more than 150m long and 60m wide at Portus, the ancient port for Rome. The five-storey high structure is thought to be from about 117 AD, in the reign of Trajan, was used to either build or service ships that travelled across the empire 2,000 years ago to keep Rome supplied with food and goods. The five-storey high boathouse is thought to be from about 117 AD . Copper tacks used for shipbuilding at Portus, the ancient port of Rome (left) and archaeologists from the University of Southampton and the British School at Rome, work on the site of the amazing discovery . The archaeologists scrap away at the ruins having discovered a large structure that was used for ship building . The largest find of its kind in Italy or the Mediterranean, it was found close to a distinctive existing hexagonal basin or 'harbour' at the centre of the huge ancient port complex, which covers two square miles. It sits by the side of Fiumicino airport and is now more than two miles from the Mediterranean. The building is so grand archaeologists think it had some form of imperial connection and might have been used for a base for galleys that transported emperors, such as Hadrian, across the empire on their way to places like Britain. Hadrian (Publius Aelius Trajanus Hadrianus Augustus) lived from 24 January 76 AD – 10 July 138 AD and was Roman Emperor from 117 to 138. He is best known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Roman territory in Britain. In Rome, he re-built the Pantheon and constructed the Temple of Venus and Roma. In addition to being emperor, Hadrian was a humanist and was philhellene (had a love of Greek culture) in all his tastes. He was the third of the so-called Five Good Emperors. The latest discovery comes after the team found an ornate private amphitheatre at the same site two years ago. The new building is further proof of a link to the leaders of the Roman world and the importance of the ruins. University of Southampton professor and Portus project director, Simon Keay, said: 'This is an exciting and important discovery and the building is a really, really fantastic thing to find. 'Emperors leaving and coming back in this period, like Hadrian, must have come through Portus and they must have had a place to stay and leave from that was of a status similar to what we have found. 'At first we thought this large rectangular building was used as a warehouse, but our latest excavation has uncovered evidence that there may have been another, earlier use, connected to the building and maintenance of ships. 'Few Roman imperial shipyards have been discovered and, if our identification is correct, this would be the largest of its kind in Italy or the Mediterranean.' Portus was a crucial trade gateway linking Rome to the Mediterranean throughout the Roman period and the archaeologists have been investigating the port's significance over a number of years. Until now, no major shipyard building for Rome had been identified, apart from the possibility of one on the Tiber near Monte Testaccio, and a smaller one recently claimed for the neighbouring river port at Ostia. 'This was a vast structure which . could easily have housed wood, canvas and other supplies and certainly . would have been large enough to build or shelter ships in,' Prof Keay . said. 'The scale, position and unique nature of the building lead us to believe it played a key role in shipbuilding activities.' Already archaeologists have found tacks which would have been used to nail lead on to the hulls of ships inside one of the bays.

"Films such as Maleficent and The Lego Movie may be made to be watched in 3D on a cinema screen, but a French agency claims that such films could damage children’s eyesight. ANSES, France's national health and safety agency, has called for a ban on stereoscopic technology such as 3D films and games for children under the age of six, while it recommends that children below the age of 13 should only use the technology occasionally. However, one vision expert claims there is little evidence to back up a ban, as only short-term discomfort has been recorded in children and adults watching 3D films. The French health and safety executive, ANSES, has called for ban on stereoscopic technology such as 3D films (a still from Disney's Maleficent which was shown in 3D is pictured) and games for children under the age of six, while it recommends that children below the age of 13  should only watch the occasionally . ANSES, the country's National Health Security Agency for Food, Environment and Work, published a research paper claiming that a ban should be considered because of ‘the possible [negative] effect of 3D viewing on the developing visual system.’ The human vision system changes ‘significantly’ during infancy, including parts of the brain that perceive depth, associated with 3D films, according to an article by Martin Banks, Professor of vision science at the University of California at Berkeley, published in New Scientist. Children under the age of six should not be exposed to 3D technologies. Children under the age of 13 should only use 3D technologies in moderation and both they and their parents should be vigilant concerning any resulting symptoms. People prone to certain visual disorders (disorders of accommodation and vergence for example) and problems with balance should limit their exposure to these technologies. Changes occur until the teenage years and the visual experiences a child receives, affects the development of binocular circuits, which are needed for depth perception. ‘These observations mean that there should be careful monitoring of how the new technology affects young children,’ he warned. He writes that two properties of binocular vision - vergence and accommodation – which can come into conflict when watching 3D films to produce a feeling of discomfort, seem to be troubling the French experts. In everyday life, our eyes move from one object to another. When the eyes are focused on an object, vergence is ‘acute’ and the viewer sees a single object, not two. ANSES’ research paper says a ban should be considered because of ‘the possible [negative] effect of 3D viewing on the developing visual system,' whereas a vision expert claims that there is no evidence to suggest long-term damage from watching 3D films (illustrated with a stock picture) To get a single, sharp image, the eyes are focused to produce a clear image on the retina, while an image is focused by changing the curvature of the lens within each eye, which is known as ‘accommodation’. Usually, both properties of binocular vision are operating on one object placed a certain distance away from the eye, but in 3D films, the image appears in front or behind the screen. The difference in distance means that there can be a conflict, which makes images appear blurry to some people. This blurriness has been proven to cause some people discomfort. However, Professor Banks says there is no existing evidence to prove that adverse effects from watching 3D films cause permanent damage to humans’ eyesight. ‘On that basis.it seems rash to recommend these age-related bans and restrictions,’ he said. He acknowledges that there are always health risks with the widespread roll out of new technology, but there is ‘no smoking gun to suggest harm is being caused,’ adding that a ban on 3D films for children seems ‘unnecessarily harsh’.","Paris-based ANSES has called for ban on 3D technology for children .

"Xiao Lian from the Gansu region in China was just 17-years-old when she opted for filler . A woman who was told her boss that her face was too thin subjected herself to backstreet cheek-plumping injections that left her severely disfigured. Xiao Lian from the Gansu region in China was just 17 years old when she opted for filler injections to plump up her face. While she was happy with the results at first, five years later things started to go wrong. Now, her permanently puffy appearance makes her look much older than her 28 years. Xiao had 'always hated the thinness of her face', and her boss's comment at the shop where she worked part-time was the final straw. He said: 'Your face is so thin, you look like a pauper and it is not conducive to the welcoming of riches', according to Guilin Life News. Xiao then decided to undergo a procedure to plump up her face. But when she made enquiries at a clinic, the cost quoted was considerable. It wasn't a price that she could afford to pay. After her initial disappointment, Xiao's friend referred her to a different clinic promising to perform the same procedure for a much more affordable price. This time, she could afford the cost and, as the doctor seemed legitimate and trained, she decided to go ahead. But the clinic did not have an operating license. Over the next month a doctor injected a substance into Xiao Lian's face 10 times. Initially, the injections did plump up her cheeks and she was happy with the results. But years later in 2009 when she was 24, her face began to swell unnaturally. Her eyes, nose and other features started changing shape. By 2013, her face had become very swollen, her eyes had drooped and her hair was falling out. She went to a doctor and tests revealed she had been injected with . hydrophilic polyacrylamide gel. The substance was previously used for breast augmentation, but is now banned in China for cosmetic surgery use after it was found to be toxic. By 2013, her face had become very swollen, her eyes had dropped and her hair was falling out . Xiaolian was extremely traumatised by her drastically altered looks and was driven to contemplate suicide. She is now undergoing corrective surgery at a cosmetic centre in Guangzhou. Doctors have warned her that because the substance was inside her body for so long it will be difficult to fix the botched procedure. 'Even for a minor surgery you need to choose a clinic you can trust,' said one of the doctors. In her case, a gel was used which has since been banned, but in other cases substances have been used which haven't been approved at all. The rate of botched cosmetic surgery procedures has been rising around the world. Plastic . surgeons across Australia have also reported numerous customers seeking . help to repair injuries from procedures they had done cheaply overseas . that went wrong. Video source YouKu . She is now undergoing corrective surgery at a cosmetic centre in Guangzhou . Hydrophilic polyacrylamide gel (PAAG) was widely used for breat augmentation n China before being banned in 2006. Hundreds of women were maimed by unsafe implants. The 'magic gel' used in the implants leaked into the body and even caused flesh to rot. An estimated 300,000 women had the gel inserted in varying forms of cosmetic surgery. The substance is banned in the West. The gel was subject to complaints and court cases as far back as 2002. Many complications associated with the nonresorbable soft tissue hydrogel filler have been reported in the clinical literature. These include inflammation, persistent mastodynia, formation of multiple lumps, poor cosmetic results, glandular atrophy, and significant spread of hydrogel into the surrounding tissue. Data on long-term toxicity is currently unavailable.","Xiao Lian from the Gansu region got cheek fillers at 17 with good results .

Scroll down for video . Charged: American actor, director and acting coach Cameron Thor, 54, is accused of driving a 13-year-old student to a secluded area in Agoura Hills, LA, and raping her . Star: Actor Cameron Thor, 54, was in Jurassic Park as the villain Lewis Dodgson, who plotted to steal dinosaur embryos. Local media reported he was the the actor charged with sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl . After Jurassic Park in 1993, Thor went on to a few other minor roles before starting up an acting studio in Hollywood . A statement by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department last night said Thor, who lives in Agoura Hill, was arrested on Tuesday and the case was presented to the District Attorney the next day. Prosecutors filed charges including rape, sexual penetration, kidnap and robbery, according to the statement. Officials said Thor was accused of sexually assaulting the girl between April 2008 and March 2009. The statement said: 'The victim consulted with suspect Thor about attending acting classes. 'After one of the consultations, suspect Thor drove her to a secluded area in Agoura Hills and sexually assaulted her. The victim was 13 years old at the time of the sexual assault.' A Cameron Thor with the same date of birth, the Los Angeles Times reported, is listed on the movie database IMDb as appearing in Jurassic Park alongside Hook, A Few Good Men and Star Trek: The Next Generation.

"A family of serial bank robbers that ran rings around the police with eight heists in four months have been caught. Brock Butson, 51, and his sons Braden, 23, and Nicholas, 20, successfully raided Academy Bank in Colorado Springs four times since May - in between robberies at the city's American National Bank, US Bank and First Bank. A major investigation team enlisted the help of the FBI after chasing the trio for four months without success. Arrested: The trio ran rings around police as they robbed one bank four times in four months. Brothers Braden (right) and Nicholas (left) took turns to raid the banks as father Brock (centre) drove the getaway car . Initially searching for one suspect, baffled officers were thrown by reports that seemed to describe the same man - but his height kept changing. But after a tip-off on Monday led them to the getaway car, the team discovered a family of gangsters in Travel Star motel. The gang were arrested on Thursday after days of surveillance. In each holdup, the suspect wore a baseball cap and demanded money without a weapon. The . father, Brock, is said to have driven the getaway car as . his children took it in turns to demand cash in a family conspiracy . harking back to the likes of the Kray Twins and The Godfather.

"These shocking pictures show the horrible fate suffered by a greyhound which fell foul of the brutal Spanish hunting industry. Prince was found starving and near death in a government-run pound after being discarded by his owner at the end of the hunting season. But a British sanctuary owner managed to nurse him back to health - and is now trying to extend the same treatment to the other animals caught up in the cruel trade. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Danger: Prince the greyhound was close to death when he was rescued by an animal sanctuary . Ill: The dog had to be nursed back to health due to his poor physical condition . Compassion: Sanctuary owner Charlotte del Rio with Prince . Greyhounds, known as 'galgos', are used in Spain for hunting, but when the end of the season comes around their owners often decide they have no further need for them. Campaigners believe that more than 50,000 dogs die or are abandoned each year thanks to the hunting industry. Some are left to wander the landscape on their own, often starving to death or being killed in car accidents. Others end up in government pounds, where they are given just a few weeks to find a new home before they are put down, and the dogs must fight each other for the food they are given. In some cases, hunters who are angry with their poorly performing dogs torture them by breaking their legs, hanging them from trees or throwing them down wells. Beautiful: Photographer Martin Usborne raised £2,000 through selling prints of this image . Happy home: Ms del Rio pictured with a number of the dogs at her sanctuary in Malaga . While Prince was not quite so unfortunate, he was in a very sorry state when Charlotte del Rio, a British expat who runs a sanctuary in Malaga, took him home from a pound. The magnificent animal was so emaciated his spine was jutting through his skin, and he was not expected to survive the night. But Ms del Rio's loving care helped Prince regain his strength, and within a couple of days he was wagging his tail again. The dog has now gained 2kg of weight, and the sanctuary is hoping to find him a permanent home in the near future. Cheery: Prince's tail was still wagging despite his miserable condition at the time of his rescue . Neglect: Around 50,000 dogs per year are abandoned at the end of the Spanish hunting season . Grisly: Prince was so badly malnourished that his spine was jutting out of his pelt . Prince's story has been highlighted by Martin Usborne, a photographer from London who is spending this year trying to save as many animals from torment as possible. He raised £2,000 for Prince's care by selling photographs of the beautiful dog, and hopes to help many more through his work. The urgency of efforts to help animals has been exacerbated by the recession, according to Mr Usborne, who says that sanctuaries in Spain have seen record numbers of cases this year.","Dog was nursed back to health at sanctuary and is now looking for a home .

"Sydney's most expensive property is expected to fetch a staggering $100 million when it is finally sold - a price that is out of reach for even many of the neighbouring residents in the affluent harbourside eastern suburb of Point Piper, in which the sprawling mansion is located. Those with mega cash to splash can make an offer on Elaine, labelled as 'the most significant residential estate to ever be sold in Australia'. The huge white seven-bedroom house has been owned by media moguls the Fairfax family for four generations and 122 years. Staggering: Elaine, labelled as 'the most significant residential estate to ever be sold in Australia', is expected to fetch $100 million . And it is just a stone's through from Wolseley Road in Point Piper, currently ranked as the 9th most expensive street in the world, at $38,900 per square metre. It is only 5km from Sydney's city centre and is built on 1.72 acres of land, with private lawns that roll down onto Seven Shillings Beach. The property, which is listed on Ken Jacob's real estate website, has seen some of Australia's most famous faces step through its grand doors for dinner parties and extravagant balls over the years. 'Erected in 1863 in the grand Victorian mansion style, Elaine's ballroom, numerous balconies boasting stunning Sydney Harbour views, and rolling gardens have played host to a bevy of important guests across four generations of ownership by one of Australia's greatest media families,' the website states. Historic: The huge white seven bedroom house has been owned by media moguls the Fairfax family for four generations and 122 years . Exquisite: This room with a view looks out onto the beach and is the perfect place to relax. Those with a passion for music can enjoy playing the piano in one of the mansion's many lounge rooms . Across three levels there are five bathrooms and the property's backyard boasts a tennis court and stables, perfect for the international elite. The house also has the potential to be turned into a 'luxury apartment development' according to Mr Jacob. And it is three times the size of the nearby Altona, which fetched $52 million when sold last year. Speaking on 2GB radio in February, Mr Jacobs said: 'It's a lovely home but the value is like most things in the land. It's unrepeatable to get that land size again, if you tried to you would have to amalgamate six, seven, eight blocks or houses in Point Piper and that would be virtually impossible.' Ocean view: The Victorian property connects straight onto Seven Shillings Beach via its rolling lawns, where residents can take their yacht out for the day or simply enjoy a refreshing morning dip . What a view: The house has three floors, allowing for magnificent views of the ocean, lush green garden and tennis court. And in the evening you can watch the sunset from one of the many balconies . Classic style: This elegant dining room will have 'played host to a bevy of important guests across four generations of ownership by one of Australia's greatest media families' However, he believes it is still 'worth more in maintaining it as a family estate' in the long-run. Talking about the type of person who might purchase the mansion, he explained: 'It's really interesting because everyone is speculating who will buy it. 'Clearly there are some local buyers who would be capable of purchasing the property and there are the Asian buyers, who I wouldn't rule out, but the thing that's been the real surprise is the enquiries that are coming through from the UK. We're getting quiet a few, whether they are expats or people who have a connection through business with Australia.' Prime location: It is only 5km from Sydney's city centre and is built on 1.72 acres of land. The property's backyard boasts a tennis court and stables, perfect for the international elite . 'Elaine is the priceless jewel of Sydney and the estate's attributes and deep-seated history are impossible to replicate, making this a truly unique opportunity to own a piece of Australian history – and to invest in its exciting future,' the property's website reads. John B. Fairfax, the current owner of Elaine, bought a large portion of the estate for $3 million from his father, Sir Vincent Fairfax, in 1989. However,  John B. Fairfax cut financial ties with the media empire that bears his name by selling his 9.7 per cent stake in Fairfax Media for $193 million in November 2011. He also retired from the board of the company in the same month. When the house first went on the market in 2013, a Fairfax family spokesman told The Australian Mr Fairfax, 71, 'believed it was now time for a new family to enjoy it'. The home was previously lived in by Lady Nancy Fairfax, but she moved out in 1994. A source close to Mr Fairfax dismissed any rumours that the house was being sold because of the family's financial position.","Seven bedroom home in Point Piper, eastern Sydney, is expected to fetch $100 million .

"From the bright lights and constant clattering of a tenpin bowling alley to the calmness of a fine art workshop, it has been quite the career change for Peter Bellerby. A few years ago, the 48-year-old was working as the boss of a tenpin bowling business. Now he is crafting a beautiful array of bespoke globes which sell up to £59,000 a time. His artisan globe company which has A-list . clients from all over the world, one of whom has already paid full price . for a 'Churchill globe' mounted on an aircraft engine replica made by the heritage technicians at Aston Martin. Labour of love: Peter Bellerby, 48, and his team built the contents of this stunning workshop from scratch after he attempted to create a homemade globe for his father . Painstaking: The papering and painting processes take the longest to learn according to Mr Ballerby. He says a trainee will take the best part of a year to learn the skill . Gentle: The sections of paper are soaking wet when applied meaning even the slightest tension can cause a rip, forcing the craftsman to start again . Mr Bellerby, founder of Bellerby & . Co, was working as the boss of a bowling alley business six years ago . when he made his first globe for his father's 80th birthday. It was the lack of well crafted globes . on the market which forced the maker's hand. According to Mr Bellerby, he . wanted a globe which wasn't a 'cheap mass produced item, but also wasn't . a 500 year old antique. The self-starting craftsman decided . that he would make his own, and after 18 months of what he said was . 'frustration and concentration' his first globe and his new business was . born. Speaking from the . studio in Stoke Newington, Mr Bellerby said the process of learning to . make globes had been more about persistence than talent. He . said: 'I knew I wanted to get my father something different for his . birthday, and a globe was just an idea I was toying with. In fact, to . begin with I was thinking about making us one each, that was obviously . before I knew anything about the work which is involved.' After . 18 months of toil, and with his first far from perfect globe under his . belt, Mr Bellerby decided he would begin making more models to cater for . what he saw as a gap in the market. But . according to the modest businessman, the transition from part time . hobbyist to full time craftsman was more to do with persistence than . innate talent. He said: 'I . couldn't claim to be a natural, that's for sure. When it comes to making . globes I'm not sure that there are any naturals it's all about hard . work and repetition. 'That's . why I had to stay in the business really, I'd put some money into the . venture and I knew that the only was it would be a success would be to . push and keep making these things until they became the products they . are today.' Range: Bellerby and Co produce a range of different sized globes all to specification. The Churchill globe, seen here mounted on a solid oak base, costs from £39,000 . Team effort: Ballerby & Co employ specially trained artists to help with the production and application of the maps in their Stoke Newington studio . Bellerby's . first lesson to learn, one vital to making a proper globe, was how craft . a truly round sphere which could then be covered in a map. Explaining . his first attempts as trying, the entrepreneur has since come to rely . on some state of the are technology to make the base for his balls. He . said: 'My first attempts were made of plaster of Paris using . mathematical instruments, what you quickly learn is that the margin for . error is tiny and so much can go wrong. 'Every time you mess up a measurement, you're essentially multiplying that by Pi by the time you're finishing the shape. 'Nowadays . we use resin which is shaped using F1 fabricators to help us build the . molds. We have a very high degree of accuracy now.' One . the shape is complete, there comes the painstaking process of applying . the maps. Something, yet again, Mr Bellery says that there is no quick . trick to. Technique: The smaller globes, left, are made from solid granite which can weigh up to 2kgs while bigger versions are hollow and covered with paper segments, right . He said: 'I have a . trainee at the moment who has been with me for a few months learning to . paper the globe, it will probably be another five until she does her . first perfect one. 'The . papering process is long and requires complete concentration. The paper . is wet so it will take the shape of the globe properly, but that makes . it very fragile. 'At times . there will be five of us papering away on a big project and there won't . be a word shared between us, you just can't take your eye off it'. Bellerby's . maps are alterations of other cartographers' works.The entrepreneur . says he simply does not have to the staff or time to run a cartography . business too, but the decorations on his globe's have made them highly . desirable. Modestly, Mr Bellerby will not be drawn on the household names who adorn their homes with his creations. He . said: 'It's true that we have customers who your reader will have heard . of, but they're no more important than my other customers, so I don't . like to single them out. Quality assured: According to Mr Bellerby,  his workshop operates a quality over quantity policy, he insists it would be impossible to 'churn out' his bespoke globes . 'Let's just say a few of my customers have their own wikipedia pages.You can work it out from that, can't you?' Estimating . that his workshop will turn out around 200 globes this year, the . craftsman says his focus remains on quality and not quantity, adding: . 'I've never had anyone come back to me to say, your globe is broke, or . scratched or misshapen... or just not good enough. 'The . thought of that makes me feel really, really bad. I suppose that's our . driving force really, it keeps my commitment to quality, anyway. Leader: Peter Bellerby, right poses with the base of a sphere ready for covering in the magnificent studio.

"Reece James is the name on many Manchester United fans' lips after the young full back scored twice in Louis van Gaal's first game in charge of the club. The 7-0 friendly win over LA Galaxy saw a new 3-4-3 formation work a treat, Ander Herrera put in a sparkling performance in midfield and Wayne Rooney return to goalscoring form, but James stole the show with two second half goals from left wing back. So, with the 20-year-old having staked a claim for a regular spot under Van Gaal, Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about James and assesses his chances for the future... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Reece James score against LA Galaxy . Staking a claim: Reece James (centre) starred in the second half of United's 7-0 win over LA Galaxy . Staking a claim: Reece James (centre) starred in the second half of United's 7-0 win over LA Galaxy . How come I have never heard of Reece James before? Thursday's win over LA Galaxy was the 20-year-old's first first-team outing of note, in either friendlies or competitive matches. He has represented the club's youth teams but has never played alongside so many of United's leading lights. A player is not necessarily considered 'young' at 20 these days, why has it taken him so long to break through? Firstly, the depth of United's reserve and youth set-ups must be noted. There are some very good footballers who struggle to get a game for their second string. Secondly, James only joined at Under 18 level - relatively late to sign for a professional academy. Inexperienced: James has only made two senior professional appearances - both for Carlisle . Where was he before then? James played at Blackburn and Preston's academies before moving to United. His older brother Matty, now at Leicester, was already at United's academy when Reece signed up. What professional experience does James have? Frankly, not much - especially given the fact James is 21 in November. A loan spell at Carlisle at the start of the last season was cut short by injury after just two appearances. Enough of the background, what sort of a player is he? James is an attacking left back, small in stature, but blessed with pace. He is comfortable receiving the ball in the final third, as he showed with two neat finishes in Pasadena on Thursday. Oh, brother: Leicester City's Matty James (left) celebrates their Championship title win in May . In good company: James has been training with the first-team squad since Van Gaal took over . VIDEO New signings keen to impress Van Gaal . In the headlines: James is mobbed after scoring one of his two goals on Thursday . What made Van Gaal plump for him? The Dutchman has stated his intent to play 3-4-3 with wing backs. Summer signing Luke Shaw will be the starting left wing back but with Patrice Evra and Alexander Buttner having recently left, and with Fabio departing in January, it's an area where the United boss has few options. What are the chances of him staying in the first-team? James knows he has very little chance of displacing Shaw in United's first-team - even though he is 20 months his senior - but if he keeps up the good work he could be a squad member as back-up to the £31.5million man. United have been linked with Wolfsburg's Ricardo Rodriguez but Van Gaal will be reluctant to over-spend on a bench-warmer and has declared his intention to promote youth. Shaw thing: James has very little chance of replacing United's £34million man .","Reece James scored twice for Manchester United vs LA Galaxy .

Treatment: Villagers watch the Gorilla Doctors treating an adult mountain gorilla as part of the Village of Hope project in Rwanda . Starting out with the first Gorilla Doctor - Dr James Foster - the group now employs 16 vets and operates across three countries - the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The group rescue gorillas from poacher's snares or when they have been exposed to potentially fatal human viruses, darting the animals with antibiotics or drugging them and operating on the jungle floor. They have been led for the past 13 years by Dr Mike Cranfield, a faculty member of the Wildlife Health Centre of the University of California Davis and divides his time between Maryland Zoo in Baltimore and central Africa. But he admits that there are dangers working with such large animals. He said: 'If the gorilla screams when darted, there is usually chaos and the silverbacks rush in to protect them.' His 'closest call' came after darting a mother with a sleeping drug so he could treat her sick infant. He said: 'Because it was so young I tried to work on it without anaesthetising it but it kept screaming and screaming.' Emergency treatment: Gorilla doctors treat an adult Mountain Gorilla .

'A silverback had circled by and here I was holding his screaming baby. This silverback was probably about 10 yards from me and was getting very, very close to charging. 'It was one of those moments when our eyes caught and it could have gone either way and it would have been pretty severe. 'So, I just quietly put the baby on the mother and backed off until the trackers and guides were able to come around in a circle to protect me.' The Gorilla Doctors have carried out more than 150 medical interventions on wild gorillas and adopted more than 20 orphans, many of whom need 24-hour-care suffering from dehydration, mental distress and wounds . Dr Dawn Zimmerman and Dr Eddy Kambale are among the doctors who inspect these young mountain gorillas and Grauer’s gorilla at the Senkwekwe sanctuary in Congo. The Gorilla Doctors’ outstanding work continues to see mountain gorilla populations rise, while other great apes, such as orangutans, decline.

Rescuers: The doctors swoop in to rescue the gentle giants when they are trapped in poacher snares or exposed to deadly human viruses . The last four years have seen the vets and scientists employ increasingly advanced techniques, which they hope will help all critically endangered species, not just gorillas. The regions the Gorilla Doctors operate in are also one of the most turbulent in the world and has been marred by genocide and war. In the past six months the team have been unable to monitor the gorillas because M23 rebels, locked in a battle with Congolese government forces, have taken over much of the Virunga National Park. They cannot say if any Gorillas have been killed in crossfire or hunted for meat during this period. However, Dr Cranfield believes most of the fighters see the financial and altruistic benefits of protecting the gorillas, and will not harm them indiscriminately. Aside from increasing the gorilla populations, his proudest achievement is seeing talented African vets ‘blossoming’ and becoming independent. Dr Cranfield hopes they can eventually double the population of mountain gorillas to more than 1,500. It is expensive work at an estimated cost of £600,000 per year but Dr Cranfield believes it is worth every penny. He added: 'It is extremely important to safeguard the mountain gorillas, our close relatives, for so many reasons, if not just as a symbol that conservation can work and save a magnificent species but also as a financial treasure to the host countries.'

"Benjamin and Hope Jordan caught babysitter Alexis Khan abusing their 7-month-old son Finn after noticing the family dog acting aggressively towards her. The couple hired 22-year-old Khan to babysit Finn when they first moved to Charleston, South Carolina last year. She cleared a background check and the two felt she was a 'good fit' at the time. Scroll down for video . Protecting the pack: The Jordan family dog is a hero after alerting it's owners to the child abuse that babysitter Alexis Khan was carrying out against their son, Finn . Warning signs: Finn's parents first noticed something was wrong when their dog started acting protective of their son whenever the babysitter was in the house . Caught on tape: Taking their dog's behavior seriously, the couple left an iPhone hidden underneath the couch to record how Khan treated Finn when they weren't there . Abuser: 22-year-old babysitter Alexis Khan plead guilty Monday to charges of assault and battery. She will spend one to three years behind bars and have to register as a child abuser when she gets out . 'About five months into her being our baby sitter, we started to notice that our dog was very protective of our son when she would come in the door,' Benjamin Jordan told WCSC. 'He was very aggressive towards her and a few times we actually had to physically restrain our dog from going towards her.' The couple started to worry about their dog's behavior, so one day they left an iPhone underneath the couch to record what happened while they were out. When the returned home they sat down to listen, and what they heard was startling. As Finn cried, Khan cursed at him saying: 'Shut up. Shut the f*** up. Shut up.' And then there was slapping noises and Finn's cry for attention turned to a cry of pain. 'I just wanted to reach through the audio tape, go back in time and just grab him up,' Mr Jordan said. 'To know that five months I had handed my child to a monster, not knowing what was going on in my house for that day,' he said. Mr Jordan says that without the dog, they may never have found out about the abuse. 'Had our dog not alerted us to the trouble, had my wife's instincts not said we need to make something happen, it could have been Finn that was killed by the babysitter. You never know.' Justice: The recording allowed the couple to bring Khan to justice. She was charged with aggravated assault and battery and plead guilty to those charges Monday . Lifesaver: Finn's dad Benjamin Jordan thanks the family dog for saving his son and other children from future, potentially fatal, abuse at the hands of Khan . Never again: Khan will be eligible for parole after one year in prison, at which point she will have to register as a child abuser so she never works with children again . Good dog: The Jordan family dog definitely deserves a treat after this good deed . They say their dog helped protect Finn, but also future children from the wrath of Khan. The babysitter plead guilty in  court Monday to charges of assault and battery. She will have to serve at lease one year of her three year sentence and register as a child abuser which will keep her from working with children in the future.","Benjamin and Hope Jordan hired 22-year-old Alexis Khan to babysit their son .

Erin John Vallace, a backstage crew worker, ran onto the stage in a bid to rub shoulders with the band during a performance in Adelaide oval. But security made quick work of the 31-year-old, barging him over and hauling him off the stage before evicting him from the premises.

"Roy Hodgson is modestly paid by extravagant FA standards compared to some other recent England managers - but with earnings of £3.5m per year he will still be the second-highest boss among the 32 nations at this summer’s World Cup. And the only other manager earning more is Hodgson’s England predecessor, Fabio Capello, who is now in charge of Russia and taking home almost £7m a year. A MailSport review of what the managers of the World Cup nations earn shows that seven bosses are earning more than £2m per year as they seek the biggest prize in their global game for their employers, who are increasingly not their own nations. Scroll down for the full list of managerial wages . Money man: Former England boss Fabio Capello will be the highest earning manager at the World Cup . Laughing all the way: Hodgson may be on less than his predecessor, but he still makes £3.5m a year . Capello’s £6.7m guaranteed pay puts him far and away in first place with almost double the salary of Hodgson. Two years with Russia will earn Capello £14m in addition to the £24m he earned as England boss with the FA between the start of 2008 and early 2012. Italy’s Cesare Prandelli (£2.58m a year) is the third biggest earner ahead of Luiz Felipe Scolari of Brazil in fourth (£2.4m), Ottmar Hitzfeld of Switzerland in fifth (£2.2m), Joachim Low of Germany in sixth (£2.1m) and Vicente Del Bosque of holders Spain in seventh (£2.02m). Six of the 32 managers have worked in England as either players or managers: Capello, Hodgson, Scolari, the USA’s Jurgen Klinsmann, France’s Didier Deschamps and Iran’s Carlos Queiroz. Louis van Gaal of Holland is set to be added to that list them when he starts work for Manchester United later this summer. The most common nationality of manager at the World Cup will be German, with Germans in charge of Switzerland (Hitzfeld), Germany (Low), USA (Klinsmann) and Cameroon (Volker Finke). Contrasting fortunes: Italy boss Prandelli is third in the list but World Cup winner del Bosque is only seventh . Premier bosses: Deschamps and Klinsmann are among the coaches who played in England . There will also be three Italians (in charge of Russia, Italy and Japan), three Agentineans (in charge of Chile, Colombia, Argentina), three Portuguese (in charge of Portugal, Iran and Greece) and three Colombians, although none of them in charge of Colombia (with Honduras, Ecaudor, Costa Rica). Eighteen of the 32 nations will be managed by coaches from their own country and 14 by foreigners. The five lowest-paid managers are all nationals of their own countries, and in order of smallest pay are Miguel Herrera of Mexico (£125,000 per year), James Kwesi Appiah of Ghana (£150,000), Niko Kovac of Croatia (£162,000), Safet Susic of Bosnia (£210,000) and Stephen Keshi of Nigeria (£234,000). Kovac’s salary for managing Croatia is the closest in size to the average citizens income in his country, being ‘only’ 19 times as much as the average Croatian earns - using United Nations per capita income figures as a guide. The average Croatian makes £8,767 a year. Above average: Kovac (left) is the closest to earning the national average, unlike Lamouchi (right) Sabri Lamouchi of the Ivory Coast, a Frenchman with a Tunisian heritage, earns the salary that is most extreme compared to the average wage in his country of employment. His annual pay of £618,125 is a staggering 795 times as much as the average annual pay of £778 per year in the Ivory Coast - or £14.96 per week. Capello is the next most lavishly rewarded when measured in the same way, earning 763 times as much as the average Russian person (£6,693,750 against £8,773). Roy Hodgson earns ‘only’ 143 times as much as the average England fan. The combined annual salaries of the 32 bosses add up to £39.1m, making the average pay £1.2m.  All the managers who have worked in England previously are picking up £1.25m per year or more.","England boss second highest earner at the World Cup .

"Alexis Sanchez believes he still has to improve despite an impressive start to his Barclays Premier League career - and insists Arsenal have the 'quality stars' needed to challenge for the title. The form of the Chile forward, signed from Barcelona in the summer for £32million, has been the one positive in an otherwise inconsistent opening by Arsene Wenger's side. Sanchez scored his 12th goal at Swansea on Sunday, when Arsenal again failed to hold onto a lead and were beaten 2-1, having thrown away a 3-0 advantage in the Champions League tie against Anderlecht. Alexis Sanchez believes he still has much to improve on despite a successful start to his Arsenal career . The Chilean (pictured celebrating after scoring against Swansea) has been a shining light for the Gunners . In a wide-ranging interview with AS Chile, the 25-year-old remains upbeat over the decision to leave Spain after the World Cup and that the Gunners can lift themselves back into contention after the international break. 'Little by little I am gaining confidence in my team-mates and am gradually learning more,' he said on www.chile.as.com. 'At first I had trouble understanding them, knowing where they ran, their movements, what gestures meant what, but every time I feel more confident. 'I am starting to memorise the moves of my team-mates and I learn to help them - clearly I need to improve and that is what I say in the dressing room, that I could stay a little less with the ball, play one touch play more often to facilitate counter-attacks, that is vital. 'I must learn that because the rapid transitions are key in this league and with this team.' While Sanchez concedes the English Premier League is 'the most complicated football and not easy' in comparison with the competitions back home and after subsequent moves to Italy with Udinese and then onto Barcelona, the diminutive forward insists he 'likes the challenge'. The Chile forward believes Arsenal have plenty of talent to come back to challenge leaders Chelsea and also progress in Europe. Sanchez is still adamant that Arsene Wenger's side can win any competition they enter . 'Now that I am here, sometimes I stop to look my team-mates during the training session and I realise that I am surrounded by a lot of quality stars,' he added. 'I have been impressed by their attitude and their talent. 'I love how they create spaces, their individual and collective movements. 'I tell you seriously: I like what I see so much that I have repeated myself many times, that if we have the required winning mentality, if we are positive and try to win every single game, I know we can win any competition. 'I know that with this team we can win many trophies in the coming years. I am convinced. 'I hope to win everything here. That's why I came.' Wenger has seen his side struggle to hold onto leads against Anderlecht and Swansea in recent weeks . Following defeat at Swansea, Arsenal find themselves in sixth place, four points behind Manchester City and already some 12 off Chelsea, who have yet to lose in their 11 league games. Like most of their rivals, the majority of the Gunners' squad are expected to be in action during the international break, with Theo Walcott back in the England fold after his recovery from a long-term knee injury, one of six Arsenal players who could feature at Wembley against Slovenia on Saturday. France striker Olivier Giroud is on course to be closing in on an earlier than expected return from a broken bone in his foot. Wenger will be hoping centre-half Laurent Koscielny can be available again following treatment on his troublesome Achilles for the visit of Manchester United on November 22, having been forced to deploy Nacho Monreal at the heart of what has looked a very suspect makeshift defence in recent games.","Alexis Sanchez has been a shining light for Arsenal this season .

A source told the Mail: . ‘The recent very heavy rain, the record rainfalls in April and the . reasonable amount of rain in May have all eased the problems. Four smaller water companies – South . East Water, Veolia Central, Veolia South East and Sutton and East Surrey . – are expected to keep the ban in place. The source said this is . because they rely far more heavily on groundwater pulled from bore holes . deep underground, where the heavy rain hasn’t yet managed to penetrate. Residents of Felpham Way, leading into . Bognor Regis, will have little need of their hosepipes just yet after . 36 hours of continuous rain in the South East turned the road  into a . river.

"A young woman claims she spent an entire flight in 2011 in the cockpit being entertained by one of the pilots who was flying the missing Malaysian Airlines plane while smoking. Jonti Roos, who is who is currently living in Melbourne during a year-long stay in Australia, said she and her friend Jaan Maree were waiting to board their flight from Phuket to Kuala Lumpur three years ago when two pilots plucked them out of the queue and asked them if they would like to ride in the cockpit. The girls, who had just finished a two-week trip to Thailand, spent the entire flight including take-off and landing in the cockpit with the two pilots, which is strictly forbidden by the airline. Scroll down for video . Happy snaps: Jonti Roos (centre right) claims she and her friend Jaan Maree (centre left) were entertained by Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27 (right) in the cockpit of a flight in 2011 . In this picture Jonty Roos and her friend Jaan Maree pose with the other pilot on the plane where they became friend with Fariq Abdul Hamid . Jonty Roos told A Current Affair last week of her friendship with Fariq Abdul Hamid, the first officer of flight MH370 . Jonty Rossi posed with the other pilot on the plane and spoke of also meeting Fariq Abdul Hamid, when they struck up a friendship in 2011 . One of the pilots was Fariq Abdul Hamid, the 27-year-old first officer on board missing flight MH370, Ms Roos claims. ‘Throughout the whole flight they were talking to us, they were actually smoking throughout the flight, which I don’t think they’re allowed to be doing and they were taking photos with us in the cockpit while they were flying the plane,’ she told A Current Affair. A mid-air explosion: The lack of debris could be explained by it falling into Malaysian jungle . A terrorist attack: Director of CIA has said terrorism could not be ruled out . Power failure: Possibly caused by deliberate cutting of power to communication instruments . Electronic warfare: 20 passengers on board were experts in this technology. Hijacking: Radar data indicates the plane might have made a U-turn. A pilot error: There is a chance of them in all air mysteries, claim experts . Structural failure: Possibly involving damage sustained by an accident in 2012 . Pilot suicide: There were two large jet crashes in the late 1990s caused by this . Aeronautical black hole: Plane is stranded hundreds of miles from current search area . She also claimed that for much of the trip the co-pilots were not even facing the front of the plane. Mr Hamid was one of 239 people on board the plane that disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on Saturday. Ms Roos says she was shocked when she saw that Mr Hamid was one of those missing. ‘When I realised that it was the exact same co-pilot… and that I had met him and been in the cockpit with him and have photos with him – that was quite shocking.’ Ms Roos said she came forward with her . information because ‘It seems like everybody’s completely in the dark . and nobody has any information.’ She does not want to suggest that Mr Hamid was incompetent and caused the crash in any way. ‘They were very friendly, but I felt they were very competent in what they were doing,’ she said. ‘I’m really not saying that I think the co-pilot is in the wrong, at all, it could have been absolutely anything.’ Ms . Roos added that while the pilots were ‘possibly a little bit sleazy’ and invited the girls to stay with them in Kuala Lumpur, she never felt . threatened by them or uncomfortable and that she was very sad for Mr . Hamid’s family and friends. ‘When . I saw all his friends and family posting on his [Facebook] wall my . heart really broke for them and my heart broke for the family of the . passengers.

"They say that only in adversity can you truly know a man. In which case, anyone watching the Bundesliga this season must be getting pretty intimate with Jurgen Klopp. Just like Brian Clough — capable of getting once routinelooking players to perform and win at the elite level, and packed full of explosive, colourful outbursts — Klopp is iconic in the rise and rise of German football. Jurgen Klopp's side have lost seven of their opening 10  games and are one place above the drop zone . Arjen Robben scores the winner from the penalty spot as Bayern came from behind to beat Dortmund . Marco Reus celebrates his 31st minute goal for Borussia Dortmund  at the Allianz Arena on Saturday night . Not only a gift to Borussia Dortmund and their remarkable support, the Bundesliga needs to calculate Klopp’s worth to their marketing and identity. His talent, his achievements and, above all, his German Boris Johnson persona have all been a small part of Saturday night's ‘German Clasico’ being beamed live to 208 of the 209 FIFA nations (with North Korea missing out as Kim Jung-un was fighting, and beating, Floyd Mayweather for the WBC Welterweight crown, he says). Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead on Saturday night in Munich but Arjen Robben hit Bayern’s late winner from the spot after Robert Lewandowski had levelled, leaving Klopp’s side sitting third-bottom. Though football isn’t renowned for its measured analysis of difficult times, it has been confusing and disappointing to see the amount of angst and headscratching involved in assessing the hard times suffered by Dortmund these past few weeks. Borussia Dortmund are becoming more redundant by the week, with Bayern Munich ruling Germany . St. Pauli's fans hold a banner reading 'no power for Juergen' before their German Cup clash on Tuesday . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was allowed leeway to argue that the departure of a single player, Luis Suarez, had set back his project — leaving his team underperforming in both league and Champions League. Pound for pound, the troubles which Klopp has had to cope with in the past two seasons dwarf that. This season, Dortmund are without one of the top strikers in the world in Lewandowski. That follows the loss — also to Bayern — of World Cup Final-winning scorer Mario Gotze. Now let’s ladle on top of that the many months spent without a handful of Dortmund’s other key players: Ilkay Gundogan, Reus, Neven Subotic, Mats Hummels and Jakub Błaszczykowski. It would be the equivalent of Barcelona being stripped of Lionel Messi, Neymar, Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba. Where the uninitiated have shown least comprehension is in failing to understand that because Hummels and Subotic have returned, it doesn’t suggest that they are even close to their best form — which is partially why Dortmund, who have rarely dominated in their poor domestic run, keep losing very soft goals. Klopp on Tuesday night, before his Dortmund side saw off St. Pauli 3-0 in Hamburg in the DFB Cup . The form of keeper Roman Weidenfeller has also been patchy. Domestically, the absence of Lewandowski has been catastrophic but, in the Champions League, it is just the reverse. Faced with teams who do not know them inside out, relieved of the burden of expectation that comes with competing for the title with the team which keeps robbing their stars (Bayern are now on record as wanting to sign Reus this summer), Dortmund have been on jet-propelled form. Top of Arsenal’s group, they have won all three games, scoring nine and conceding none. Klopp’s Bundesliga bunglers have the best record in the Champions League — ahead of Bayern, Real Madrid and Chelsea. One calm voice amidst their painful loss of form has been their former Champions League-winning coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who said: ‘Even though Lewandowski was a big loss for Dortmund, few would have expected them to make this kind of start to the season. ‘Of course, they had a lengthy injury list, new players needed to be integrated and the players that went to the World Cup either took time to regain their form or still need time to. Dortmund are performing well in the cup competitions but are struggling in the Bundesliga, sitting 16th . However, I get the impression it is more to do with the fact Dortmund aren’t used to losing. They haven’t had a losing streak like this since 2000.’ Nor is the 65-year-old thrown by, the vast chasm of difference in quality between their European campaign, which continues this week at home to Galatasaray, and their Bundesliga work. ‘Teams performing at contrasting levels in different competitions happens quite a lot,’ he said. ‘You could also point towards it being a psychological problem because Dortmund have nearly always been the better side this season, especially on home soil. They just seem to have forgotten how to score goals. ‘The players’ confidence also takes a knock with each defeat. Then they become too eager to push forward in search of goals and the dilemma becomes bigger.’ As serious as Klopp takes the club’s predicament, and as hurt as he was by losing his superstars to Bayern, he has remained sanguine in adversity. Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion has arguably the most boisterous atmosphere of any ground in Europe . ‘Common sense is my biggest skill,’ he said. ‘To understand life, and to see football as only a part of this, then to help my players understand what happens at a given time on the pitch or during the season. ‘Players are handled like superstars and sometimes need help to find the right way — and that’s my job. It’s not wholly important whether you win or lose the last game. It’s about the answers rather than the emotion of the moment. ‘There will always be questions and, as a coach, you have to have the answers.' Bet on Klopp to find them.","Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund sit in 16th place in the Bundesliga .
They are performing well in the cup competitions, but league form is awful .
Just like Brian Clough  Klopp is iconic in the rise and rise of German football .
Dortmund's best chance of getting out of this mess is with Klopp ."
"England captain Steven Gerrard says his team have 'no fear' ahead of their World Cup opening clash against Italy in the jungle city of Manaus this evening. He also played down fears over the state of the pitch in Manaus, saying it would pose no problems to their game plan.

Of course we have respect for Italy, they are a great team with wonderful players. 'But no fear, we are confident and cannot wait for the kick-off now to get going. We have a game plan.’ Liverpool striker Sturridge posted the picture yesterday evening with the message: 'Now we're cooking!! #squad #worldcup 2104 #team #england shoutout to Luke Shaw for the sweet boy pose. I see you baby lol.' Steven Gerrard also posted a photograph on his Instagram account overlooking the Arena da Amazonia, saying: 'A view of the stadium through the jungle. The wait is almost over.' Meanwhile manager Roy Hodgson urged millions of fans back home to support his squad through their tough group stage, saying the team wanted to give supporters something to cheer about. Summing up the team's expectations, he quoted the RAF's Latin motto, Ardua ad Astra, meaning 'through adversity to the stars'.

Kardashian, don't you?"" 'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.' She claims Khloe, who is married to . Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different . father to her sisters and younger brother Rob. 'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest.

"In his lifetime, Steve Jobs was roundly criticized for seemingly not donating enough money to philanthropic causes. However, it has been revealed recently that the late founder of Apple and his wife - both intensely private individuals - quietly made large donations to charity. Jobs never addressed his philanthropic endeavors and . refused to discuss the subject even with his biographer, Walter . Isaacson. But now, his widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, has publicly spoken out about  her charitable work. Humble do-gooder: Steve Jobs, pictured here with his wife in 2011, was often criticized for seemingly not donating enough money to charity, but as it turns out, the Apple founder quietly gave away millions of dollars . Intensely private: Laurene Powell Jobs, founder and chair of Emerson Collective and widow of the late Apple founder Steve Jobs, designed her organization in a way that allows her to make donations anonymously . Also, it has surfaced recently that . the founder of Apple Inc. donated $50million of his own money to . hospitals in California and funded HIV and AIDS research. 'We're really careful about . amplifying the great work of others in every way that we can, and we . don't like attaching our names to things,' Laurene Powell Jobs said in . an interview to the New York Times. Steve Jobs' widow has founded Emerson Collective LLC, which is structured on the model of a small business, allowing the organization to make anonymous donations to various causes, from grants to political campaigns. Powell Jobs has been actively backing College Track, the college preparatory organization she co-founded in 1997. 'I’ve always appreciated that being the wife of Steve Jobs, she could have played that as much as possible, but she doesn’t,' said Marshall Lott, who has worked at College Track. Pet project: Powell Jobs founded College Track, a college preparation organization, in 1997, and she has been sponsoring the group ever since . Every year, the animation studio Pixar, which Mr Jobs helped launch, hosts a screening of a film to raise money for Powell Jobs' College Track . Every year, the award-winning animation studio Pixar, which Mr Jobs helped launch, hosts a screening of a film to raise money for College Track, suggesting that the family have been doing charity work behind the scenes. Jobs' attitude toward philanthropy stood in sharp contrast to that of other billionaires, most of them only too happy to draw the public's attention to their commitment to philanthropy. Speaking out: U2 lead singer and humanitarian Bono, who was friends with Jobs, wrote an op-ed insisting that his contributions to the fight against AIDS in Africa were 'invaluable' In 2011, Steve Jobs found himself in the middle of a controversy following the publication of a New York Times article, which claimed that there was no public record of the Apple founder giving money to charity. In response, U2 lead singer and humanitarian Bono, who was friends with Jobs, wrote an op-ed insisting that Jobs' contributions to the fight against AIDS in Africa were 'invaluable,' according to Apple Insider. The musician revealed that Apple, which has been supporting his (Product)RED charity, also has been the chief financial backer of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, adding that the tech giant has given millions of dollars toward HIV research. Last year, Jobs' successor, Tim Cook, said that his late boss gave $50million to Stanford hospitals, which went towards building a children's medical center and a new main building. Jobs also declined an invitation to join The Giving Pledge campaign spearheaded by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, which encourages the one-percenters to give away most of their wealth to charity in their lifetime.

"Many people would find it an attractive way to spend time - getting paid for playing Call of Duty or spending your life trying to break the record for the most number of goals scored in a game of FIFA. Will Johnson, 21, of Arkansas, has earned a whopping £83,000 from playing the first-person shooter, while Jacob Gaby, 15, of Bushey, Hertfordshire, achieved a gigantic 189-0 win on the football game. They are record-breakers with Brett Martin, 31, of Colorado, who has 8,030 pieces of video game merchandise, and Mark Slevinsky, 30, of Alberta, Canada, creator of the smallest arcade machine. Scroll down for videos . Reached his goal: Jacob Gaby, 15, of Bushey, Hertfordshire, managed a gigantic 189-0 win on the FIFA football game, as Barcelona against Fulham. He plays the game for around seven hours a week . Target: Will Johnson, 21, of Arkansas, became the Highest Earning Call of Duty Player after making £83,000 from winning four titles on the Major League Gaming Pro Circuit between 2009 and 2012 . Jacob, who broke the record for the Highest Margin of Victory against the Computer on FIFA, came up with the idea while playing with his brother - and is on the game for around seven hours per week. ‘I never went out to achieve a record,’ he said. ‘I was just sat playing the game with my brother. We were bored, so he challenged me to see how many goals I could score against the computer.’ ‘By half time I had scored over 100. It was pretty mad. My brother couldn’t believe it - he told me to keep going as there must be a record. By the final whistle I had scored 189 goals.’ But the parents of Jacob, who was playing as Barcelona against Fulham on the FIFA 12 version of the game, will not let the win go to his head. ‘They want me to concentrate on my schoolwork as I’ve got major exams coming up,’ he said. Jacob played two 20 minute halves on the game - so he averaged scoring nearly five goals a minute. Impressive: Brett Martin, 31, of Colorado, who has 8,030 pieces of videogame merchandise, was given his first item - a Super Mario figure - by his parents aged just eight. Now he holds a world record .

Mr Johnson - known as ‘BigTymer’ - became the Highest Earning Call of Duty Player after making £83,000 from winning four titles on the Major League Gaming Pro Circuit between 2009 and 2012. He said ‘it’s perfect to have solid proof that I am the best in the world at a craft I’ve spent years working on’, but added that he may have to cut down his game time ‘or I risk losing my girlfriend’. Another record-breaker is web designer Mr Martin, who has the Largest Collection of Videogame Memorabilia. He got his first item - a Super Mario figure - from his parents aged eight. He only started collecting 12 years ago when he began using eBay, but has since amassed a collection worth more than £62,000. ‘My kids love the collection,’ Mr Martin said. ‘My wife is tolerant.’ He added: ‘Many of my friends know I’m a gamer, but I guess after this they’ll realise just how passionate and obsessed I am.’ Driver: Another person to be recognised is Jann Mardenborough, of Wales, who became the Youngest GT (Gran Turisimo) Academy Winner - an initiative set up by car maker Nissan and the Sony PlayStation . Wheely quick: Leyla Hasso, who holds the record for the world's fastest female Super Mario Kart player . At the other end of the scale, the Smallest Arcade Machine - created by computer engineer Mr Slevinsky - took six months to design and build, and stands at a tiny 4.88 by 2.05 by 2.36 inches.

He wanted to be a racing . car driver when he was younger, and was called a 'natural' by the owner . of a kart circuit aged eight - but the costs were too high, so he turned to video games instead. Other impressive feats, which are being recognised in the Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition 2013, include Canada’s Chris Gloyd and Timothy Bell - who achieved the Longest Gaming Marathon. The pair lasted an astonishing 120 hours and 7 minutes on the Resistance first-person shooter series.

"David Beckham is set to lead a campaign to stop the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in Africa. As part of his role as a Unicef ambassador, the former England captain will appear in a video which highlights ways to prevent the spread of the virus and will be broadcast across West Africa. The 39-year-old will explain how cleanliness is crucial in controlling the epidemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea as the death toll rises to 4,033. David Beckham is set to lead a campaign to help stop the spread of the deadly Ebola virus by starring in a video . His role in the outbreak was revealed by Sierra Leone Football Association president Isha Johansen to the Sun on Sunday. She said: 'To have David Beckham involved in this campaign is massive for us and we are so grateful to him. In Sierra Leone football is a religion. 'All men, women and children follow a player or a team from the Premier League but David Beckham is the favourite.' It comes as the Confederation of African Football said it had 'registered' concerns about the  African Nations Cup tournament taking place in Morocco in January and February 2015. The footballer visited Freetown in Sierra Leone where he met with children and played a roadside football game . As part of his role as a Unicef ambassador he went to a therapeutic feeding centre in the town of Makeni in Sierra Leone - one of the areas now worst affected by the deadly Ebola outbreak . Mrs Johansen added: 'Out country and the whole of West Africa is facing a terrible plight and the numbers who are dying are incredible.' The football star visited Makeni in Sierra Leone in 2008 - one of the areas worst affected by the virus. Many of the victims in the town have been young children. Beckham also met with players from Mrs Johansen's football club - FC Johansen - based in the capital Freetown during the visit. Discussions surrounding the African Nations Cup are due to be discussed at a meeting next month. Officials said they had taken into account 'health risks posed by the Ebola virus'. Meanwhile a female nurse from Texas who treated America's Ebola 'patient zero' became the second person in the country to test positive for the deadly virus today. Grief-stricken: This photo, taken by photographers John Moore and Mohammed Elshamy, show the grim reality of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, West Africa . A victim's body wrapped in a blanket as the deadly virus rages in West Africa and claims lives of 4,000 people . Writing for the The New York Times, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy a the University of Minnesota, said those experts are loath to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria. Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.' But the chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate. He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the Ebola virus will change over time. Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' But Professor Heymann, told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus. 'I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus. 'The virus's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions, which is exactly the same as other past epidemics.","David Beckham will appear in video to highlight ways of preventing spread .

"Daley Blind rescued Manchester United from defeat at West Bromwich Albion with a last-gasp equaliser - but their defiant manager Louis van Gaal amazingly still insists that he can win the Barclays Premier League. The Dutchman said: 'Call me arrogant but we can still catch Chelsea. I have done it before.' The draw leaves Van Gaal with only one more point than David Moyes achieved after eight games last season — but he has a fixture list from hell awaiting him.

But Blind curled home from the edge of the area late on to add to Marouane Fellaini's first goal for the club. Van Gaal said: 'It is two points lost. I think we were the better team. I am very disappointed about the result. Van Gaal said his decision to bring on Marouane Fellaini at half time came just a few minutes into the game . Fellaini scored a stunning goal just two minutes after replacing Ander Herrera at the break . Premier League top 10 . 'I don't think West Bromwich Albion has created many chances, I think zero, and we gave the two goals away. 'We have created four chances in the first half and seven in the second half. I am happy about our playing style but not happy with the result.' United missed the chance to re-enter the Champions League places and lie sixth, 10 points behind Chelsea. Yet Van Gaal claimed the gap could still be clawed back. 'That's possible but it is difficult to say,' he said. 'But I am arrogant because I have done it a lot of times.' Van Gaal brought on Fellaini to replace Ander Herrera at half-time but said he made the decision after only a few minutes of the match. 'We have to look also for physical talents and maybe that's our problem,' he said. 'I'm a coach who is always thinking about creative players but in England you also need physical bodies and Fellaini is one of these.

"An 'alien' planet believed to be up to five times bigger than Jupiter has been detected 300 light years from Earth. The giant ball of gas has been pictured orbiting its young star by the European Southern Observatory. The planet, known as HD 95086 b, is . shown as a bright blue dot at the bottom left of the picture and was . spotted by the ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile. The image from ESO's Very Large Telescope shows the newly-discovered planet HD95086 b, next to its parent star . The star, HD 95086, has been removed from the picture to allow the planet to shine through, Fox News has reported. Julien Rameau, astronomer at the Institute of Astrophysics and Planetology in France, is lead author of the study. Announcing the discovery he said: 'Direct imaging of planets is an extremely challenging technique that requires the most advanced instruments, whether ground-based or in space. 'Only a few planets have been directly observed so far, making every single discovery an important milestone on the road to understanding giant planets and how they form.' The researchers have said it may be the lightest, or 'least massive', planet that is not in the solar system and has been directly observed. This picture shows the sky around the young star HD 95086 in the southern constellation of Carina (The Keel). It was created from images from the Digitized Sky Survey 2 . Most exoplanets are not pictured directly but are often detected through indirect means, such as noticing a dip in a star's brightness when a planet passes in front of it, blocking its light. According to the research, which will be published in an upcoming image of Astrophysical Journal Letters, the planet orbits the star at about 56 times the distance between Earth and the Sun. Last week MailOnline reported how Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope could be used to find alien planets capable of supporting life. Researchers at MIT said the telescope could look for small, Mars-size rocky exoplanets orbiting 'failed stars', known as brown dwarfs. They said the hunt could uncover planets capable of supporting life.","Scientists estimate the planet could be up to five times bigger than Jupiter .

"Italy captain Gianluigi Buffon's World Cup could be over before it begins after the veteran goalkeeper suffered a twisted ankle in training. The 36-year-old Juventus keeper is out of Italy's opening game at the 2014 World Cup against England and is a doubt for the Azzurri's second match against Costa Rica. With Paris Saint-Germain's Salvatore Sirigu set to deputise, Buffon is in a race to be fit to for Italy's final Group D game against Uruguay on June 24. But Sigiru has also been struggling with a bruised rib – but the 27-year-old promised Prandelli on the morning of the England game that he was fit to play.

Buffon hobbled off and later tweeted: 'there are many ways to be important, even if you can't be a protagonist on the pitch. ... So go Salvatore.' The third goalkeeper in the squad is uncapped 21-year-old, Mattia Perin, of Genoa, who was criticised for his performance by the Brazilian media when he conceded three in a practice match against Fluminense last week. The goalkeeping crisis adds to Prandelli's defensive woes. The Italy boss lost . his first-choice left-back Mattia di Sciglio, when the AC Milan . full-back suffered a calf strain in training on Thursday. It has not forced him home but he will not be fit for the Group D game in Manaus, which means a reshuffle at the back. It was unclear whether the Italians would settle for switching . Torino’s Matteo Darmian to the left and bring in Ignazio Abate of AC . Milan at right-back, or whether he would move Giorgio Chiellini from . centre-half to left-back and start with Parma’s Gabriel Paletta in the . middle.

The 27-year-old has eight caps for the national team and started for Italy in their friendly against Republic of Ireland at Craven Cottage last month. Sirigu recently had some injury problems of his own after bruising his ribs during training in Florence on June 2 but has recovered in time to face England in Manaus.

"Paul Scholes is used to plaudits from his peers as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation by now - but not usually at half time during a game.

"He is widely considered to be the modest man of middle-distance running and a gentleman of the sporting world. But when it comes to winning, it seems that Mo Farah can be just as much a glory-hunter as anyone. When asked who should win BBC Sports Personality of the Year, the double Olympic champion answered honestly  – and put his own name forward. Going for glory: Olympic gold medallist - and MoBot originator - Mo Farah tipped himself as the winner of BBC's Sports Personality of the Year award . The father of twins was the only one of the shortlist of 12 nominees to name himself when asked by Radio Times who they would vote for if they could. ‘I want to win it myself,’ said the 29-year-old who brought the house down at the Olympic Stadium when he won the 5,000 and 10,000 metres and set off a craze with his MoBot celebration. He must fend off stiff competition if he is to win the prestigious honour. Olympic and Paralympic champions dominate the shortlist for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. Tennis . ace Andy Murray, cyclists Sir Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins, athletes . Mo Farah and David Weir, sailor Ben Ainslie plus golfer Rory McIlroy are . in the mix for the coveted top award. Special edition: Mo Farah grazes the cover of RadioTimes where all 12 shortlisted reveal who they want to see as winner . Cover stars: Favourite to win, according to bookmakers, is Bradley Wiggins, followed by Mo Farah, Andy Murray and Jessica Ennis who told the Radio Times she 'hasn't touched the ground' since her win . Heptathlete . Jessica Ennis, cyclist Sarah Storey, boxer Nicola Adams, swimmer Ellie . Simmonds and rower Katherine Grainger are also in the running. In any other year, at least four of the stars could expect to walk away with the trophy. Tennis ace Andy Murray, 27, not only won Olympic gold but also the US Open. Bradley Wiggins won his fourth  Olympic gold medal just 10 days after becoming the first British rider to win the Tour de France. He was also the sportsman most of the other nominees said they would like to see win. Rory McIlroy established himself as world No.1 golfer, winning the USPGA Championship. He was also a member of the dramatic Ryder Cup-winning team. The 23-year-old was the only one of the 12 nominees not to have won gold at London 2012. Here come the girls: Heptathlete Jessica Ennis is also in the running for Sports Personality of the year - a shortlist which completely lacked female athletes last year . Medallists nominated: Olympians Mo Farah and Sir Chris Hoy's achievements during the games impressed . Will Wiggo win?: Cyclist Bradley Wiggins is among the 12 on the shortlist for BBC Sports Personality of the Year . Heptathlete and London 2012 poster . girl Jessica Ennis is another of the favourites to win. She told Radio . Times this week: ‘We need more coverage of women’s sport, and we need to . get women involved in coaching and administration.’ Cyclist Bradley Wiggins, 32, is tipped . to triumph, with bookmakers Ladbrokes naming him the odds-on favourite . at 2/5. Farah is second favourite at 5/1, then Murray at 8/1, while . Ennis is 10/1. Not a single woman made it on to last year's final shortlist despite a strong year of competition. The controversy triggered a review of the process for this year's event, which has also produced a shortlist that includes two more sports personalities than usual. An expert panel has also been introduced. After a golden summer of home-grown sport including the London 2012 Games, the event promises to be the biggest in the programme's 59-year history. It is being held at London's ExCeL centre on December 16. There is no place on the list for cyclist Jason Kenny who won two golds at London 2012 to add to the gold and silver medal he had already clinched at the Beijing 2008 Olympics. On the list: Tennis ace Andy Murray, seen lifting the US Open championship trophy in September, has been nominated . Inspiring: Paralympians Sarah Storey and Ellie Simmons are on the prestigious shortlist for 2012 . Gilded sails: Olympic medallist Ben Ainslie has won gold in four consecutive games and is the world's most successful Olympic sailor . Golden girls: Boxer Nicola Adams and rower Katherine Grainger celebrating their Olympic wins this summer . Cyclist Laura Trott, another double gold medallist at London 2012, is also missing. The impressive performance of triathlete Alistair Brownlee in clinching gold at the Olympics was not enough to get him on the list. There is also no place for star names including Paralympic T44 100m champion Jonnie Peacock and para-equestrian rider Sophie Christiansen whose golden hat trick at London 2012 means she now has five golds, a silver and bronze medal from three Paralympics. Leaving these deserving athletes off the list was 'very difficult,' according to Barbara Slater, the BBC's sport director. Winning scream: David Weir celebrates his third Gold Medal during London 2012 Paralympics . Lonely golfer: Rory McIlroy is the only person on the shortlist not to have won an Olympic or Paralympic medal . She wrote in her blog: 'The panel also reflected long and hard on the heroics of stars from other sports such as (Europe's Ryder Cup golf hero) Ian Poulter during the ""miracle of Medinah"", the continued brilliance of Carl Froch and the ""magnificent seven"" from Champion Jockey Richard Hughes - in any other year these sportspeople would probably be front-runners to win the overall award. 'If we ever needed reminding just how special a sporting year it has been, then the list of those sportspeople who did not make the final 12 is testament to that.' The prizes for Team of the Year, Coach of the Year and the Overseas Personality Award are to be decided by the expert panel.

"The judge leading the probe into media behaviour threatened to quit after he was publicly criticised by a Cabinet Minister, senior Government sources claimed last night. Lord Justice Leveson phoned Whitehall’s most senior mandarin and demanded that Education Secretary Michael Gove – who claimed the inquiry had created a ‘chilling atmosphere’ towards freedom of speech – should be gagged. In the angry call to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, the judge claimed that if Ministers were not silenced, his inquiry, set up to investigate phone-hacking by Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers, would be rendered worthless. He also summoned Mr Gove to give evidence to the inquiry to explain himself. An alarmed Sir Jeremy informed David Cameron of the judge’s ultimatum. Lord Justice Brian Leveson threatened to quit after he was publicly criticised by a Cabinet Minister . Mr Justice Leveson, QC, left, threatened to quit the inquiry after his work was criticised by Education Secretary Michael Gove who said the inquiry had brought a 'chilling atmosphere around freedom of expression' Government insiders say they were convinced Leveson was prepared to resign in protest unless Ministers stopped passing comment on his inquiry. ‘Our clear impression was that he was spitting tacks with Gove and was ready to resign unless the  Minister was told to shut up,’ said one source. Other insiders insisted Leveson did not threaten to walk away from the inquiry, but they confirmed the phone call to Sir Jeremy – and that Leveson said Ministers such as Mr Gove should not speak out. ‘Leveson said that if this was going to continue with Cabinet Ministers offering opinions while the inquiry was in its early days, he would have to question whether the inquiry had any value, bearing in mind it was using public money,’ said the source. ‘He did not threaten to resign.’ A spokesman for the inquiry said: . ‘Lord Justice Leveson is conducting a judicial inquiry and, in that . capacity, will not comment on prospective press stories outside the . formal proceedings of the inquiry.’ The spokesman refused to make any further comment. Downing Street, Mr Gove and the Cabinet Office, where Sir Jeremy is based, all refused to comment. The extraordinary row erupted after Mr Gove gave a speech to political journalists at a House of Commons Press Gallery luncheon on February 21. He argued that the Leveson Inquiry had created a ‘chilling atmosphere’ towards freedom of expression and any attempt to tighten regulation of newspapers could result in ‘a cure worse than the original disease’. Mr Gove was concerned about groups with vested interests ‘fettering’ the press. He conceded that illegal activity  conducted by some sections of the media had to be ‘vigorously policed’ but said Ministers should not be  panicked into over-reacting to the phone-hacking scandal. He appeared to have riled Leveson with pointed comments accusing ‘the Establishment, the great and the good and judges’ of joining forces with celebrities who wanted to muzzle a free press. Mr Gove said: ‘When an undoubted wrong has been done there’s a desire to find a judge, a civil servant, a representative of the great and good, inevitably a figure from the Establishment, to inquire into what went wrong and to make recommendations about what might be put right. ‘It’s a natural thing for politicians to do but sometimes there are dangers associated with it.’ He added that there was a danger of regulation being imposed by ‘judges, celebrities, and the Establishment . . . all of whom have an interest in taking over from the press as arbiters of what a free press should be.’ An enraged Leveson immediately instructed his officials to compile a full report of Mr Gove’s comments. And within 24 hours, he phoned Sir Jeremy to protest. The Cabinet Secretary informed  No 10 and Mr Gove. Cabinet sources say neither Mr Gove nor other Ministers were ordered to keep quiet about the Leveson Inquiry. However, few have spoken out since his indignant phone call. But the bitter feud between Mr Gove and Leveson was evident when the Education Secretary, a former journalist at The Times, owned by Mr Murdoch, gave evidence at the inquiry on May 29. A defiant Mr Gove repeated the arguments he made at the Commons Press Gallery, almost word for word, to the evident annoyance of Leveson. The judge insisted new rules were needed to curb media excesses, while Mr Gove strongly defended Mr Murdoch and said journalists were ‘exercising a precious liberty’ when they wrote articles. A clearly irritated Lord Justice Leveson snapped: ‘Mr Gove, I do not need to be told about the importance of freedom of speech, I really don’t.’ He was ‘concerned’ by Mr Gove’s view that ‘unacceptable’ behaviour has ‘to be accepted because of the right of freedom of speech’. But Mr Gove stuck to his guns, insisting attempts to stamp out wrongdoing could make things worse. by Michael Mansfield, QC . Michael Mansfield QC . We’re definitely in this together’. These words were revealed to the Leveson Inquiry this week as part of a text message sent by Rebekah Brooks to David Cameron on the eve of his conference speech in October 2009. Various meanings have been proposed, but one could not have been intended. It is that the digital age has transformed not just the medium but also the message and without due care we will all end up ‘in it together’. Thoughts and identity become  public property. For some, there is empowerment, for others humiliation. For some, means of change, for others the opportunity for exploitation. In 1968, Andy Warhol observed: ‘In the future everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.’ Note, not just the obvious people, but ‘everyone’. The advent of social networking, texting, tweeting, YouTube, Facebook, Myspace, blogs and e-petitions has created an information highway beyond measure, along which millions of individuals are transported every second. All brought to you in handy pocket-sized devices. We are on the verge of living in a ‘screen culture’, a transposition of the ‘private’ into the ‘public’. A byproduct of this invasion is unverifiable material. Critical thinking is in danger of being swamped. This has to be addressed by education to circumvent misunderstandings. Jurors in criminal trials are warned not to surf the net. It would incur a significant risk of untested material influencing the verdict. The point we’ve reached requires precaution by everyone. Privacy is a treasured necessity for the security and development of the individual. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: ‘No one should be  subject to arbitrary and unlawful interference with his privacy.’ This has been consistently reinforced by judicial pronouncements. Yet what has happened, surreptitiously and rapidly, is a widespread voluntary, unrecognised surrender. In the rush to be in constant touch with every event and feeling, to be a global villager, we have sacrificed who we are to scrutiny. The price is details of your identity and consumer preferences. To get a bus pass, a store card or any product online, they want your birthmarks. The small print offers you to other organisations unless you spot the tiny opt-out box. At the same time as corporations are assembling dossiers of personal information, the State is proposing greater powers of intrusion. Last week, the Home Secretary Theresa May and Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe announced the need to access more details of phone calls, texts and emails. More than 95 per cent of major crime investigations involve covert techniques. None of this sits comfortably with the Coalition vow after the last Election ‘to reverse the substantial erosion of civil liberties under Labour’. The mantra of ‘national security’ trips easily off the tongue of authorities whose record for responsible governance is being seriously questioned at the Leveson Inquiry. The close links between senior Government figures, senior Met officers and the Murdoch machine hardly restores confidence in a system of checks and balances. More appropriate might be the concepts of manipulation and exploitation. There is another, converse side to this story. The power of the new technology cannot be contained and cannot be controlled. It is a people’s revolution of astonishing force. The ongoing Arab Spring, a struggle against oppression and censorship, has been facilitated by the use of unofficial blogs, tweets and film. On our own streets, the unlawful activities of police can be captured on mobile phones which give the lie to the official version of events. Unlawful corporate activities can also be exposed. It is a form of accountability and democratisation which has been sorely lacking. There is a clear tension between these forces. A resolution can only be entertained if we redefine the idea of ‘privacy’. It is up to the individual to police his or her identity. It is no coincidence that we are in the middle of an economic and environmental meltdown derived from a shadow economy in which the truth was hidden until collapse was unavoidable. It is a wake-up call of astronomic proportions. The moral high ground has to be reclaimed by the pursuit of principle and transparency. New forms of governance must be formulated that enshrine accountability. I doubt this can be delivered through the ballot box, but it might through the mobile phone.","Extraordinary ultimatum from the man leading probe into media standards .

"Attacker: The couple, from Upper Milford Township in Pennsylvania, want to get away from Oliver Larry Beck but they claim his presence in the neighborhood has made their property impossible to sell . The family of a young girl sexually abused by a neighbor two years ago is trying to make her attacker buy their home, in a groundbreaking lawsuit. The couple, from Upper Milford Township in Pennsylvania, want to get away from Oliver Larry Beck but they claim his presence in the neighborhood has made their property impossible to sell. In the first suit of its kind, the unnamed couple are asking a judge to force the 65-year-old, his wife and his mother to buy their residence, at a cost of $235,000, and pay for them to move. In addition, the family is going after damages for the child's pain and suffering caused by the 2011 molestation. Beck was sentenced to almost two years in jail after he pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting the child. Investigators said he lured the victim into his basement by telling her he wanted to show her a bear's head mounted on the wall. After telling the girl to feel the bear, he made her take off her clothes then assaulted her. The child's father found out and called police. The family allege Beck assaulted their daughter, who he used to take on drives, play games and give candy and sweets to, multiple times between 2009 and 2011. After Beck was released from prison, he resumed his old address, but the victim's family claim in the lawsuit that they're 'under duress' to move house now he's back living in the neighborhood. Legal experts say this is the first time a lawsuit has attempted to force a defendant to buy a home, and many believe a judge wouldn't even have the power grant such a request. 'I have never heard of that and the court may say it has no authority to order that,' University of Virginia Law School professor Douglas Laycock told The Morning Call. 'If the house, in fact, lost value, and if the owners are entitled to recover for that, that value can be awarded in damages without transferring ownership of the house. 'Selling the house to the offender might be a sensible part of a settlement, but it would be odd as a court-ordered remedy.' St. John's University associate law professor Anthony Sabino told the newspaper that making Beck buy the home could be deemed unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment. Lawsuit: The parents have filed the lawsuit in Lehigh County Court, pictured child molested by a neighbor have taken an unusual step to get away from the man who abused their daughter . But a sexual assault survivor and executive director of the Victim/Witness Assistance Program in Harrisburg Jennifer Storm said she thinks the creative request would set a positive precedent. 'I applaud any effort that a victim can take to ensure their well-being,' Storm told the newspaper. 'I think this could be a good case to potentially set precedent.' In a court brief filed this month, Beck's lawyer Robert Magee said the lawsuit's demand for the home purchase is 'not appropriate or authorized under a legal or equitable theory,' according to the Morning Call. He said that the family is still able to use and enjoy their home. Previous cases asking for damages because an undesirable development has made their house difficult to sell have been dismissed, with the Pennsylvania court claiming: 'Any time a property owner engaged in an activity that ostensibly reduced surrounding property values, liability would attach.' Meanwhile, the lawsuit accuses Beck of sexual assault, negligence and inflicting emotional distress, among other allegations. Beck's wife and mother are accused of negligence in the document, with the family claiming they knew or should have known of Beck's attraction to children and the risk he posed to their young neighbors. The little girl suffered emotional distress, shame and embarrassment and will need indefinite therapy to deal with the abuse, the suit says. Homeowners selling up are not required to inform potential buyers that a sex offender lives next-door, but the family said they would feel obliged to tell the new owners, in case he strikes again. Research shows, having a listed sex offender in the neighborhood drops home prices by between 4 and 12 per cent.","Pennsylvania couple .

The world's most decorated athlete touched the wall first in the men's 100m butterfly. And in the minutes on either side of Phelps' grand exit, two teenage compatriots etched their names in Olympic history with incredible victories. About five minutes before Phelps jumped off the starting block, Missy Franklin not only won a gold medal, but the 17-year-old shattered a world record in the 200m backstroke. Several minutes after Phelps's win, Katie Ledecky, at just 15, dominated in the 800m freestyle, nearly setting a new world record herself. Bowing out: Michael Phelps celebrates after winning the Men's 100m butterfly final - his final race . Another gold: Missy Franklin reacts after winning gold and breaking the world record in the women's 200m backstroke final . Phenom: Katie Ledecky, at just 15 years old, nearly shattered a world record in the 800m freestyle . Phelps has won an astonishing three . golds and two silvers in five races in London. Franklin also has three . golds and a bronze. They are the only triple-medallists of the 2012 . games. Franklin clocked in at 2 minutes, 4.06 seconds, 0.75 quicker than the mark set by . Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe at the 2009 world championships in Rome in a . now-banned bodysuit. It was the seventh world record of the games. Trifecta: It was another dramatic day for Team USA, with Phelps, left, Franklin, centre, and Ledecky, right, all winning gold medals . Add to that the success of Ledecky, who won the 800-meter freestyle by a full two seconds. The youngest member of the U.S. swim team narrowly missed a world record in the blistering race, falling off pace on the last lap and finishing in 8 minutes, 14.63 seconds. Mireia Belmonte Garcia of Spain touched in 8:18.76 to take the silver medal and defending champion Rebecca Adlington of Great Britain finished in 8:20.32 for bronze. Adlington set the world record of 8:14.10 at the 2008 Beijing Games. Been here before: Michael Phelps holds up yet another gold medal, the 21st of his incredible Olympic career . Big moment: Missy Franklin flashes a smile - and her Olympic hardware - after her world record backstroke . Youth: Katie Ledecky just missed a world record, but at 15 years old, she has plenty of time to try again . Winning: Phelps, left, leads South Africa's Chad le Clos, right, during the men's 100-meter butterfly final . Despite her amazing feats, Franklin has refused to accept cash prizes or sponsorship deals. Instead she is holding on to her amateur status so she can swim for a college team - when she is old enough. And her aggressive performances in the water could not be further from her gentle demeanor when she climbs out, reverting back to the modest school girl who looks almost surprised to be there. 'I dreamed about this moment my whole life,' Franklin gushed after winning the gold medal in the women's 100-metre backstroke – her first - on Monday. 'I finally got one after 17 years!' Record breaker: Missy Franklin's relentless performances in the water could not be further from her gentle demeanor when she climbs out, reverting back to the modest school girl who looks almost surprised to be there . A As her parents are Canadian, they offered their daughter the option to swim for Canada, but their daughter refused, pointing out the support she has had from her hometown and high school. Franklin manages to squeeze hours of training around her schoolwork, exam prep and social life at Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado, but admitted in a recent interview that it's not always easy. 'Swimming - there's so much energy you . have to put into it and I want to go to practice and work hard, so . there's days when I can't stay out late, I can't go out with my . friends,' she said. Basking in the glory: Michael Phelps has just one more chance to earn a medal in tomorrow's 4x100 medley relay . True grit: Phelps and Lochte show off their new Olympic accessories poolside after their 'duel in the pool' on Thursday . But the story of the day is most likely Phelps, who completed his last individual swimming event with 21 gold medals - 17 of them gold. Phelps's final race will take place tomorrow night in the 4x100 medley relay. In the last clash of the swimming . titans in London yesterday, Phelps showed why he's the greatest Olympian . of all time in his final race . against friend and rival Ryan Lochte. The 27-year-old Phelps picked up gold . in the 200m individual medley, as Lochte . came in right behind him. The Olympic swimming sensation has made no secret about the fact that he plans to retire after the London games.

One more win: Michael Phelps won yet another gold medal in his last solo race, the 100-meter butterfly . Rumours have swirled that Phelps may be heading to a career in television after the London games. Though . Phelps hasn't divulged post-retirement plans, America's top TV networks . are reportedly falling over themselves hoping to land Teams USA's . golden boy as a sports commentator. TMZ reported . that NBC, ESPN and ABC are preparing to capture Phelps as a future . Olympics commentator with huge contracts that could be worth millions - . in a possible bidding war. Michael Phelps has been swimming since he was seven years old, and while he has . been subjected to more than a decade of training, his body is . tailor-made for swimming. His . 6'7"" wingspan is longer than his 6'4"" height, giving him a reach . advantage. He also has an unusually long torso and extremely flexible . ankles. Tack on his size 14 feet, and there is a practically unbeatable swimmer. Though he made the finals in the 200m butterfly in the 2000 Sydney games, Phelps - at just 15 years old - could not place higher than fifth. Born to swim: Michael Phelps has been swimming competitively since he was just seven years old . It would be another four years before he could make a splash. At the Athens games in 2004, he picked up six gold medals and two bronze at 19. But . it was in Beijing in 2008 when Phelps captivated the nation and . rocketed to worldwide fame when he grabbed eight gold medals in all . eight races. In fact, Phelps' performance at the Beijing games was so impressive that many tried to persuade him to retire. But rather than leave competition on a high note, Phelps said he would swim in London. There . were bumps along the way, most notably the notorious bong photo that . appeared in the pages of the now-defunct News of the World in early . 2009. Going Greek: At the Athens games in 2004, Phelps picked up six gold medals and two bronze when he was just 19 years old . Phelps eventually admitted . 'regrettable' behaviour and 'bad judgment' after the image, which showed . him inhaling from a marijuana pipe, surfaced. In . a statement released by one of his agents amid the scandal, Phelps . said: 'I engaged in behaviour which was regrettable and demonstrated bad . judgment. The statement . went on: 'I'm 23 years old and despite the successes I've had in the . pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner . people have come to expect from me. For this, I am sorry. I promise my . fans and the public it will not happen again.' Phelps is believed to rake in more than $40million a year in . endorsements with brands like Speedo, Subway and Nike. The New York Post reported that the swimmer is currently single, having broken up with his former . Miss California USA girlfriend Nicole Johnson in January. At the height of his fame, Phelps also started the Michael Phelps . Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting healthy lives and an active . lifestyle among children through swimming.","Michael Phelps' last solo race was the 100-meter butterfly .

"Liverpool midfielder Jordon Ibe is set to return to Anfield after being recalled from his loan spell at Derby County. The 19-year-old talent has already played 24 times for the Rams this season, 20 of which in their Championship campaign, helping them to second in the table. And it appears he will not be shipped out elsewhere, with Liverpool keen on keeping the youngster at Anfield for the time-being.

"Medicine could be delivered via a high-speed pressure jet through the skin in a new needleless method developed by scientists which could spell the end of painful injections. The Star Trek-style device, unveiled by scientists yesterday, can be programmed to deliver a range of doses to varying skin depths. The breakthrough will be a welcome relief for those with phobias of needles who may avoid immunisation because of their fears. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . High-velocity: The device (pictured) can be programmed to deliver a range of doses to varying skin depths . Pointless: The mechanisms of the system, which includes the use of a coil and magnets, are shown in this diagram . In the hit science fiction series Star Trek, the space ship's medical officer Leonard 'Bones' McCoy would treat injuries with a needleless device. Researchers now think they have come up with a similar system which produces a high-velocity jet of drugs to penetrate the skin. The device is said to be a major improvement on some fledgling jet-injection systems that have been developed. The researchers say that among other benefits, the technology may drastically cut the number of accidents among doctors and nurses who accidentally prick themselves with needles. Out of this world: The system is similar to the ones used by Dr Leonard 'Bones' McCoy in Star Trek . A needleless device may also help improve compliance among patients who might otherwise avoid the discomfort of regularly injecting themselves with drugs such as insulin. Catherine Hogan, a member of the research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: 'If you are afraid of needles and have to frequently self-inject, compliance can be an issue. 'We think this kind of technology ... gets around some of the phobias that people may have about needles.' In the last few decades, scientists have developed various alternatives to hypodermic needles. For example, nicotine patches slowly release drugs through the skin. But these patches can only release drug molecules small enough to pass through the skin's pores, limiting the type of medicine that can be delivered. Now an MIT team, led by Professor Ian Hunter has engineered a jet-injection system that delivers a range of doses to variable depths in a highly controlled manner. The design is built around a mechanism called a Lorentz-force actuator - a small, powerful magnet surrounded by a coil of wire that's attached to a piston inside a drug ampoule. When current is applied, it interacts with the magnetic field to produce a force that pushes the piston forward, ejecting the drug at very high pressure and velocity (almost the speed of sound in air) out through the ampoule's nozzle - an opening as wide as a mosquito's proboscis. No more fears? The breakthrough is bound to be a welcome relief for those with needle phobias . In tests, the group found that various skin types may require different pressure to deliver adequate volumes of drugs to the desired depth. Ms Hogan said: 'If I'm breaching a baby's skin to deliver vaccine, I won't need as much pressure as I would need to breach my skin. We can tailor the pressure profile to be able to do that, and that's the beauty of this device.' The breakthrough is reported in the science journal Medical Engineering and Physics.

"In glorious sunshine and attention focused during political speeches, these youngsters are pictured on a summer camp the day before the murderous rampage on Utoya island. Smiling as they enjoyed the annual camp, it is not known how many of the politically-motivated youngsters in this picture were killed when gunman Anders Breivik embarked on his 90-minute murder spree. For more than 20 years, members of the Norwegian Labour Party's youth group the AUF have descended on Utoya island for the annual camp, which features partying, music and debates. Engaged: Smiling youngsters listen to a speech during the Norwegian Labour Party youth camp on Utoya Island, just 24 hours before gunman Anders Breivik shot dead 68 . Massacre: The island hosts an annual youth camp for politically-engaged youngsters, featuring partying, music and debates . Victims: It is unclear how many of the youngsters seen in these images were killed when Breivik embarked on his 90-minute shooting spree . Trail of carnage: Breivik criss-crossed Utoya island during his rampage, before he surrendered to police . Grief: Two girls look at flowers, candles and messages left near Utoya island. Many of the victims have still not been officially identified . Sharidyn Svebakk-Bohn, above, was shot dead on Utoya Island during the 90-minute killing spree carried out by Anders Breivik. She is among 33 confirmed to have died in the twin bomb and shooting attacks in Norway on Friday. That still leaves 43 unaccounted for, with police looking for bodies in the lake surrounding the island. Those killed include:Trond Bernsten; Syvert Knudsen; Havard Vederhus; Simon Saebo; Aleksander Aas Eriksen; Maianne Sandvik; Ismail Haji Ahmed; Tarald Mjelde; Johannes Buo; Gunnar Linakar; Emil Okkenhaug; Chrisopher Perreau; Snorre Haller;  Tore Eikeland; Torjus Blattman; Andrine Bakkene Espeland; Anders Kristiansen; Guro Havoll; Sverre Bjorkavag; Tove Ashill Knutsen; Hanna M.

Balch Fjalestad; Bano Abobakar Rashid; Diderik Aamodt Olsen; Simon Saebo; Synne Royneland; Anne Lise Holter; Birgitte Smetbak; Margrethe Boeyum Kloven; Even Flugstad Malmedal; Tamta Liparteliani . The pictures were taken by the country's Foreign Minister, Jonas Gahr Stoere, just 24 hours before the mass shooting. It . comes as dramatic details emerged of the moment police finally arrested . Breivik after he had gunned down 68 people on the island and killed . another eight with a fertiliser bomb in Oslo. Officers . revealed they came within seconds of shooting Breivik as they stormed . on to the island as they believed he might be strapped with explosives. Senior police officer Haavard Gaasbakk said: 'We could see that shots were being fired on the southern tip of the island. 'We could see ammunition hit the water, and we heard the cracks. 'We come to a forested area and the suspect stands there right in front of us with his hands high above his head. 'The . situation was very tense, and they couldn't see - the way he was . clothed, they worried he could have had a suicide bomber's vest.' Breivik's gun, a semi-automatic rifle . he appeared to have modified to make it automatic, was found on the . ground 50ft behind him. An armed police team was forced to . commandeer private speed boats after their vessel developed engine . problems on the way to the island. As they arrived, frantic youngsters pointed to where Breivik was still firing and the officers ran to arrest him. More than 600 people were evacuated from the island and officers set up an emergency treatment centre for the wounded. Details of the terrifying 90-minute shooting spree have also emerged, with Breivik crossing the island as he chased victims. The 32-year-old got off a ferry armed with his rifle, a pistol and carrying ammunition in a bag at 5.07pm on Friday. Thirty seconds later he shot dead Monica Busei, 45, and off-duty policeman Trond Berntsen, 51, near houses on the island. He . then calls a group of youngsters together at a cafe, claiming he has . important news on the Oslo bombing, before executing them. At . 5.15pm, Breivik stalks through the island camp site shooting youths as . they try to run away, before reaching a track called Love Path where he . kills the majority of his victims. Police . are alerted at 5.33pm, as Breivik shoots people who have jumped into . the lake or climbed trees in a desperate bid to get away. Armed police arrive at the island at 6.26pm, when Breivik drops his weapon and surrenders. Plot: Police at Breivik's farm, where he made a fertiliser bomb which he detonated in the government district in Oslo, killing eight . Destruction: This image showing the crater was taken minutes after the bomb blast in Oslo . Norwegian police said today they will interrogate Breivik again tomorrow over the bombing and shooting. Police lawyer Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby told a news conference they will question him for the second time, but did not indicate what they will ask him. Breivik was first questioned for seven hours on the day after the attack. He has confessed to the attacks, claiming he was trying to save the Western world from Muslim colonisation, but denies responsibility for the killing. His lawyer said he considers himself a 'saviour' and is likely insanse. Last night Norwegian police officially identified more of the people killed in both attacks. Parents of foreign students who were at the camp have also travelled to the Scandinavian country in the hope their children survived. The body of a young Georgian woman has been identified this morning. Tamta Liparteliani, a university graduate and Young Socialists activist, was found at the bottom of the lake with gunshot wounds to her back. She was identified by her fingerprints. A Romanian woman whose daughter was also on the island said she had called and texted her 'hundreds of times' since the attack, but now believes she is dead. Anca Holst said 15-year-old Karin Elena Holst phoned her to say a man was 'shooting everyone'. The petrified girl did not want to hang up, but her mother urged her to stop talking and hide, she told Romanian TV. But she has not heard from her since. 'I think my child is dead,' she said. Before launching his attacks, which killed a total of 76 people, Breivik wrote of his allegiance to the Knights Templar - which he described as a secret society created to carry out a crusade against Islam in Europe. Victims: Bano Abobakar Rashid, 18, and Margrethe Boeyum Kloeven, 16, were both shot dead on Utoya island . Gunned down: Diderik Aamodt Olsen, 19, and Hanne Fjalestad, 43, were also killed during the 90-minute shooting rampage across the island . A British man called Paul Ray, who writes an anti-Muslim blog called 'Lionheart', has claimed the group does exist and he was one of its founders. But he denied any contact with Breivik and denied he was the Norwegian's mentor. In his manifesto, Breivik claimed the group was created at a meeting in London in 2002 and he was mentored by a man called 'Richard (the Lionhearted)'. The medieval Knights Templar was a Christian military order founded in the early 12th century whose members, wearing white mantles with a red cross, became one of the most formidable fighting forces of the Crusades. It was dissolved in 1312. Cut off: Breivik, 32, is being held at Ila prison, a former Nazi concentration camp, where is not allowed access to TV, newspapers, radio or mail . Anders Breivik is being held at Ila . prison, a former Nazi concentration camp, but could be moved to another . maximum security jail. One possible facility overlooks the Tyrifjorden waters and is close to Utoya Island where he launched his attack. Last night, the killer was being kept in isolation and was on 'suicide watch'. A . full evaluation of his mental state is likely to take up to three . months, but prison sources have said he may not wish to cooperate or . answer questions. Ila . was originally a women's prison called Grini before the German invasion . of Norway during World War Two saw it become a concentration camp run . by the Gestapo from 1940. Detainees . included a raft of Norwegian political prisoners and the camp was . enlarged as more people arrived, before being shipped to Dachau or . Auschwitz. In 1942 five . members of the First Airborne Division were captured after their glider . crashed in bad weather on a failed 'Operation Freshman' mission to bomb . a chemical plant. The . British survivors were taken to Grini and later - on the express orders . of Adolf Hitler - they were marched into nearby woods, blindfolded and . shot one after another in the back of the head. Breivik has been banned from receiving post, reading newspapers, watching TV or listening to the radio. He is only allowed to see a priest, doctors or his lawyer. In . his manifesto, Breivik pledged to escape from any prison holding him . and said he had formulated a 'second bonus mission' which would see him . assassinate 'up to five traitors' once he had escaped. He claimed he had intelligence on his later targets so he could carry out his operation 'in a timely and professional manner'. His plan said he had already buried weapons and equipment near to the prisons he was most likely to be held at. He would then hijack a vehicle from a civilian and 'initiate' his mission.","Politically-engaged youngsters were enjoying annual camp on Utoya Island .

"A man suspected of stabbing a 70-year-old woman to death in 1976 has been arrested after detectives tricked him into taking part in a fake 'chewing gum survey' to get his DNA. Gary Raub, 63, was arrested yesterday in Seattle in connection with the brutal slaying of Blanche Kimball, whose mutilated body was found inside her Augusta, Maine, home 36 years ago. Detectives with the Maine State Police and the Augusta Police Department flew interstate to nab the man, who was known as Gary Wilson in 1976, with help from Seattle police. In custody: Gary Raub, pictured right, has been arrested on Monday for the 1976 stabbing death of a 70-year-old woman after DNA obtained from chewing gum, right, linked him to the crime . Mr Raub is listed as a transient on the Kennebec County Superior Court complaint charged with murder and criminal homicide in the first degree. The complaint accuses him of 'knowingly inflicted great physical suffering' on Ms Kimball, a retired dental technician and practical nurse who occasionally rented out rooms in her house. According to The Kennebec Journal, an autopsy on Ms Kimball counted '23 stab wounds to the chest, two stab wounds to the abdomen, 16 cuts and lacerations to the head, and three cuts and abrasions to the hands.' Mr Raub, one of the woman's tenants, was interviewed twice by detectives after her killing but denied any involvement in the horrific attack, police said. Crime scene: Victim Blanche Kimball was stabbed almost 50 times in her home in Augusta, Maine, which is now a parking lot, pictured . Interest in the cold case was rekindled . earlier this year when blood splattered on Ms Kimball's kitchen drawer . underwent DNA testing and proved to be from a man. 'It appeared that the person who had stabbed Blanche Kimball may have sustained injuries that caused him or her to bleed, leaving possible suspect blood on various items in the living room and kitchen,' Maine State Police Detective Abbe Chabot said in an affidavit. Mr Raub's saliva was matched to the DNA . from the blood sample, after an undercover Seattle police officer . managed to get the suspect to participate in a 'chewing gum survey' in . July. Mr Raub was taken to the King County Jail yesterday afternoon and was denied bail. He is expected to appear in court tomorrow, where the process of extraditing him back to Maine will begin. Behind bars: Mr Raub is being held at King County Jail in Seattle, pictured . Ms Kimball was last seen painting her . steps on Memorial Day in 1976, police said. When her body was found on . June 12, it was decomposing and her clothing was pulled up, exposing her . pubic area, according to Mr Chabot's affidavit. Neighbours called police fearing for Ms Kimball's safety after she hadn't been seen for several days. Officers found the woman's home scattered with broken glass and debris. Police suspected him in the murder in part because he had been caught trying to break into a home near Ms Kimball's residence shortly after her death. The case is the oldest unsolved killing in Maine in which an arrest has been made.","Gary Raub, 63, was arrested yesterday in Seattle in the brutal slaying of Blanche Kimball 36 years ago .

"In the last clash of the swimming titans in London, Michael Phelps showed why he's the greatest Olympian of all time as he boosted his medal count to 20 in his final race against rival Ryan Lochte. The 27-year-old Phelps picked up gold in the 200m individual medley, as Lochte, his friend and closest rival came in right behind him. The Olympic swimming sensation has made no secret about the fact that he plans to retire after the London games.

Heavy medal: Lochte, left, and Phelps, right, smile together after picking up their respective medals in the 200m individual medley on Thursday . The win - his first individual gold medal in London - was a historic trifecta for Phelps, who is now the only male athlete to win the same event in three-straight Olympics. He led the field from beginning to end, and touched the wall first in a time of one minute, 54.27 seconds, just outside Lochte's world record of 1:54.00 that he set last year in the final at the Shanghai world championships. Lochte, close to exhaustion after winning bronze in the 200 backstroke, held on to finish second, just 0.63 behind his teammate. Phelps had only kind words for his compatriot. 'Ryan has probably been one of the toughest competitors I've swam against, all-around competitors,' Phelps said of Lochte. 'We're seeing a lot more competitors coming up.' Posting on Twitter after the dramatic swim, Lochte said: 'Hell of a race with @TylerClary and @MichaelPhelps.' In the water: Phelps, left, and Lochte, right, raced side-by-side .

Rumours swirled today that Phelps may be heading to a career in television after the London games. Though Phelps hasn't divulged post-retirement plans, America's top TV networks are reportedly falling over themselves hoping to land Teams USA's golden boy as a sports commentator. TMZ reports that NBC, ESPN and ABC are preparing to capture Phelps as a future Olympics commentator with huge contracts that could be worth millions - in a possible bidding war. True grit: Phelps and Lochte show off their new Olympic accessories poolside . Teammates: Phelps' rivalry with fellow American Ryan Lochte, right, is one of the biggest stories of the 2012 games . While the networks try to woo Phelps . with dollar signs, there was only one thing on the swimming champ's . mind: His final race today with rival Lochte. Their . first showdown of the London Olympics went to Lochte in a runaway on . the opening night of the swimming competition. This one was much closer.

Lochte had a busy schedule on another . big day for American swimmers, winning a bronze medal in the 200m . backstroke final - about a half hour before the 'duel in the pool' against Phelps. Though friends, the two have sparked a rivalry in the water, with many Americans split on who to root for. But Phelps appeared to have one backer that Lochte does not - the leader of the free world. Phelps, still reeling from the previous day's tweet, described the call as 'pretty cool'. 'I answered the phone and the voice said ""Michael?"" ""Yes."" ""Please hold for the President of the United States,""' he told reporters today, after qualifying for the 100-meter butterfly semi-final. 'I was like, ""wow.""' The president, he said, told Phelps the country was supporting him and proud of his performance. The conversation took an awkward turn when the president said: 'Make sure you tell your mom I said hi'.' Glory: Though friends, the two have sparked a rivalry in the pool, with many Americans split on who to support . Phelps' mother Debbie, who raised Phelps and his two sisters single-handedly, is considered to be a great contributor to his success, helping him with his hyperactivity, and egging him on from the stands at every meet. The final Phelps-Lochte contest was the main event in another huge day for American swimmers. Rebecca Soni won gold in the women’s 200m breast stroke final, shattering a world record. She clocked in at 2:19.59, breaking her own mark of 2:20.00 that she set in the semifinals. Soni said: 'I'm so happy. I can't believe I did it.'

Tyler Clary won gold and set a new Olympic record with his performance in the men's 200m backstroke. After the race, he was in disbelief, saying: 'The fact that it just came to fruition is something that hasn't even processed in my mind yet. 'The fact that I'm now an Olympic champion and Olympic-record holder is something that is very humbling. It's also very motivating for the next four years.' Yesterday, Nathan Adrian won the 100m freestyle and the team of Missy Franklin, Dana Vollmer, Shannon Vreeland and Allison Schmitt in the 4x200 free relay on Wednesday. Adrian won a thrilling race that came down to the end. He got to the wall one-hundredth of a second ahead of James 'The Missile' Magnussen of Australia, becoming the first American to win the 100 free since Matt Biondi at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

"There has been tension on the set of the talk show The View for months now. And it looks like things may come to a head sooner rather than later, according to a Monday report from TMZ, as Rosie O'Donnell is again pegged as a troublemaker on the set of the ABC show. 'Executives doubt she will even finish the season,' a source told the site. Rosie's rep has denied the report. Scroll down for video . More reports of bad blood on set: On Monday TMZ claimed that Rosie O'Donnell, pictured in September, may not last the entire season of The View as she has been 'rude' and a 'malcontent' on the show . Among the complaints about the 52-year-old personality is that she is a 'malcontent' who is 'bringing down' the show. And with the ratings for the afternoon chat fest on a steady decline, no one wants to put up with her reportedly unpleasant behavior. O'Donnell's reported bad attitude allegedly comes from her unhappiness that she is not in charge of the hosts. Rather it is Whoopi Goldberg who is the key 'moderator.' All smiles here: The hosts, which include (from left) Whoopi Goldberg, Nicolle Wallace, and Rosie Perez, have not gelled well, according to several reports, and the ratings are not good either . The site claims that does not sit well with the League Of Her Own actress. 'Rosie came in thinking she'd be in the lead position at the table, the moderator,' a source has said. 'She was outraged when it became clear the title and the power belonged to Whoopi.' Other hosts on the show include Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace. Power struggle?: A source has claimed that the 52-year-old TV personality (far left) is not happy that Goldberg (second from left) has all the power as the 'moderator' This has left O'Donnell 'depressed' and not in the mood to chat with other people on the show, it was claimed. It has also been reported that executives have tried to reason with the outspoken TV fixture, but it's like 'talking to a wall,' said a source. 'She is impossible to deal with,' an insider told TMZ. 'She is rude both on and off camera.' ABC has yet to address claims of strife on set and there has been no suggestion that The View hosts will depart. But the source has insisted that Rosie does not have another season in her. 'It's out of the question,' the insider has said. Problem? What problem?: The League Of Her Own actress' rep has said she has no issue with Whoopi . O'Donnell's rep told TMZ, 'This is absolutely false. Whoopi Goldberg has been the moderator since Whoopi was hired and Rosie knew that before she took the job.' In late November Rosie and Whoopi argued about Bill Cosby and whether his sexual assault accusers had any merit. O'Donnell has yet to address reports that she is not liked on the show and is instead going about her business. On Monday the brunette posted a photo of a child on top of a pit bull. 'Baby and pitbull !!! #2CUTE,' she wrote, seemingly not fazed that the breed of dog has a history of violence against children.","Rosie is said to be 'rude' and a 'malcontent' on the ABC daytime talk show .

"Steven Spielberg has predicted that the movie industry could soon move to a two-tier pricing structure with consumers being charged a premium to see summer blockbusters compared with other types of films. ‘You're gonna have to pay $25 for the next Iron Man, you're probably only going to have to pay $7 to see Lincoln,’ Spielberg told students at the University of Southern California. Spielberg was speaking at the opening of . a new media center at the University of Southern California, where he . was joined by his friend and peer George Lucas. Hollywood legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have predicted that the movie industry will soon to shift to a two-tier price structure . The two legendary directors warned that a . perfect storm of half a dozen or so $250 million blockbusters flopping at . the box office was inevitable and would radically change how the . industry works. The ‘implosion’ would lead to consumers could be asked to paying varying prices at movie theaters, reports The Hollywood Reporter. 'There's going to be an implosion . where three or four or maybe even a half-dozen mega-budget movies are . going to go crashing into the ground, and that's going to change the . paradigm,' said Spielberg. Lucas suggested that in the future . movies might follow a more 'Broadway play model', whereby fewer are . released, but they stay in theaters for longer and ticket prices are . higher. Worthy of $25 a ticket? Spielberg predicts rising tickets costs to see future installments of blockbuster franchises such as Iron Man . 'You’re going to end up with fewer theaters, bigger theaters with a lot of nice things. Going to the movies will cost 50 bucks or 100 or 150 bucks, like what Broadway costs today, or a football game. It’ll be an expensive thing. … (The movies) will sit in the theaters for a year, like a Broadway show does. That will be called the ‘movie’ business,' he said. 'There’ll be big movies on a big screen, and it’ll cost them a lot of money. Everything else will be on a small screen.' Spielberg, who also revealed that . 'Lincoln' was almost premiered on HBO, told USC students they were . entering the industry at a time when even established film-makers were . struggling to get their projects into cinemas. 'I think eventually the Lincolns will go away and they're going to be on television,' Star Wars creator Lucas added. Spielberg revealed his critically acclaimed hit 'Lincoln' came close to being premiered on HBO rather than in cinemas . 'As mine almost was,' Spielberg interjected. 'This close - ask HBO - this close.' 'The . pathway to get into theaters is really getting smaller and smaller,' said Lucas, pointing out that 'Red Tails' - his own passion project . about the Tuskegee airmen - flopped. 'We're talking Lincoln and Red Tails - we barely got them into theaters,' he said. 'You're talking about Steven Spielberg and George Lucas can't get their movie into a theater!' His prediction prompted Spielberg to recall how his 1982 film 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' had stayed in theaters for a year and four months. Spielberg also praised Netflix, but said he had 'nothing to announce' when asked if he planned to make original content for the online streaming service which has started to generate its own content. Back in 1982 'E.T.' stayed in theaters for a year and four months .","The legendary film director predicts that consumers will soon be asked to pay different prices depending on the type of movie they go to see .

"A celebrity personal trainer jumped off Beachy Head after losing her job and having problems with her girlfriend, an inquest heard yesterday. Angie Dowds, 42, sent a text in her final moments at the notorious Sussex suicide spot saying: 'My heart is broken; my spirit is broken'. At the time of her death last November, presenter Davina McCall, who she appeared on hit ITV show The Biggest Loser with, led tributes to her. She said: 'Rest in peace Angie Dowds. So so sad.' Tragic suicide: Angie Dowds was a health guru on ITV show The Biggest Loser . The inquest heard that Miss Dowds had drinks and drugs in her system, a combination described as 'severely toxic', when she threw herself off the cliff. Her GP said she had experienced ongoing addictions to alcohol and drugs and had taken overdoses and made a number of suicide threats in the past. The award-winning fitness guru had contact with mental health services and had refused treatment at one point. After her death, it was revealed that local health services had neglected to book an outpatient's appointment for her after she declined treatment. It was put down to an 'administrative error' initially, but a 'serious untoward incident' inquiry has since begun into what happened. Yesterday, her brother Kevin Dowds accused doctors of letting down his younger sister. Shocking death: Miss Dowds jumped from the cliffs at Sussex beauty spot Beachy Head .

"Downton Abbey's scheming under-butler Thomas Barrow isn’t anyone’s idea of a hero. But in the new series of the hit ITV drama, the manservant played by Rob James-Collier risks his life to rescue a sleeping Lady Edith from a blaze that engulfs her bedroom. Our exclusive pictures from the opening episode of the fifth series show the dramatic moment Thomas lifts the Earl of Grantham’s daughter into his arms and leads her to safety down a smoke-filled corridor. Scroll down for video . Into the inferno: Under-butler Thomas Barrow saves Lady Edith in an unexpected act of heroism . The show’s 12 million fans know that Thomas has been blackmailing lady’s maid Baxter and his unexpected act of heroism allows him to dig himself out of a tricky situation. The dramatic storyline – which has been glimpsed in trailers for the series – leads to the full-scale evacuation of Downton. However, to avoid spoiling the series for viewers, we will not reveal the fate of any other characters. Producers could not risk smoke damage to the corridor at Highclere Castle, where the series is filmed, so they built a replica at Ealing Studios. The fictional fire has echoes in the history of Highclere, according to Lady Carnarvon, chatelaine of the Berkshire stately home. Writing on her blog about what she calls ‘the great fire of Downton’, the Countess details the two blazes that hit Highclere in the past. The first ravaged the North Library 150 years ago, and she said viewers could spot the consequences of that blaze. She wrote: ‘If you look closely at the gilded ceiling when you are watching the TV series you will see that it is far less ornate than the main library.’ The second fire broke out in rooms above the library in the 1930s. On that occasion three bedrooms were gutted but no one was hurt. Escape: The pair flee through a corridor - but the scene was filmed in a studio, not the Highclere Castle . Flames of passion are also raging through Downton Abbey in the new series. Lady Mary Crawley’s love life is centre stage now that she has finally come to terms with the death of her husband Matthew, while the fallout from Anna’s rape and Lady Edith’s secret love child continues to cast a long shadow. The new series is set against the election of Britain’s first Labour government in 1924. The result proves unpopular with butler Carson, played by Jim Carter, and the Earl, played by Hugh Bonneville, who is convinced the new government is committed to the destruction of what he calls ‘people like us’. When his daughter Mary asks if he is prejudiced because new Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald is the son of a crofter, the Earl replies: ‘I don’t care if he is the son of Fu Manchu.’ The first episode, which airs at 9pm on Sunday, September 21, is set as the Granthams celebrate their 34th wedding anniversary. They may not actually live at Downton Abbey but these three women will make their presence felt in series five. Outspoken school teacher Sarah Bunting (Daisy Lewis, above left) secretly helps assistant cook Daisy to brush up on her maths and English. But Sarah’s Left-wing views cause conflict as the Earl of Grantham calls her the ‘Boudicca of the North Riding’. Meanwhile, the Dowager Countess’s imperious friend Lady Shackleton (Dame Harriet Walter, centre) is embroiled in a love triangle with Isobel Crawley and Lord Merton. But there’s far greater scandal as the amorous Lady Anstruther – played by Anna Chancellor, right – is an unwelcome house guest.","Dramatic scene in opener of series five sees manservant Thomas Barrow become the hero by rescuing Lady Edith from her bedroom during a fire .

The 90-year-old billionaire was not a part of his girlfriend Sydney Holland's adoption of a baby girl in June but apparently he has become a part of the child's life. Holland, who is less than half her boyfriend's age as she recently turned 42, has been bringing her daughter to Redstone's Beverley Hills mansion. Happy couple adopting: Billionaire Sumner Redstone's 42-year-old girlfriend Sydney Holland, is adopting a child, Alexandra Red. Her name was inspired by his . That isn't his only connection to the little girl, as Holland used him as inspiration for her name: Alexandra Red. 'Sydney spends a lot of time at Sumner’s home, so when she is there, she brings the baby with her. It is her child, and he is not involved in bringing her up,' a source told The New York Post. People who have seen Holland toting the baby around town are now speculating that perhaps he is the girl's father since she has red hair. 'Could the baby be Sumner's biological child?' an unidentified source wondered to the newspaper. Redstone has two children from his first marriage, though they are both in their 60s, making them old enough to be the adopted daughter's grandparents as opposed to her hypothetical step-siblings.

"French travellers who prevented doctors from parking outside a hospital when they parked their caravans there say they are in the UK 'on holiday' and plan to go home soon. Speaking from their mobile homes in the car park outside Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital, one of the gypsies said: 'We will not stay long - this is a holiday.  We live in Nice and Paris and will go home soon.' News of their bizarre holiday choice comes a day after the Mail revealed how hordes of Roma travellers had been moved on by French police from camps in cities including Paris and Marseille. The gypsies, who set up camp over the weekend with 14 caravans and an array of luxury cars including two Mercedes, a BMW X6, and a Volkswagen, blocked hundreds of NHS staff from parking outside the hospital, which is taking legal advice on how to move them on. The travellers, who say they are 'on holiday', have set up camp in the staff car park of Royal Gwent Hospital . Staff at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport can't park at work today because French gypsies have set up camp . Cars with French numberplates and 14 caravans have appeared in the NHS hospital's staff car park . More than 3,400 staff work at the Royal Gwent Hospital, above, which serves a population of 600,000 . Hospital spokesman Julian Hayman said legal advice was being sought over how to eject the travellers but warned staff that the 300-space car park would be closed in the meantime, possibly for as long as three days. When asked whether the hospital would have the power to forcibly eject the caravans, Mr Hayman told MailOnline: 'We are in discussions at the moment with our legal team on that front.' He said medical staff would need to make alternative arrangements for parking until the caravans, which arrived over the weekend and are taking up 65 of the spaces at the Whiteheads car park, moved on. More than 3,400 staff work at the Royal Gwent, which has 750 beds and serves a population of more than 600,000. A hospital worker, who didn’t want to be named, said: 'Finding a parking space is bad enough normally without this happening first thing. 'I find it infuriating this situation can be allowed to continue until the families decide to move themselves on. 'There are doctors and other medical staff who work on emergency cases around the clock. 'They are being forced to park some distance away all because a group of French travellers fancied the spot to set up camp.' Unusual destination: The Welsh car park has been sequestered by 14 caravans and a series of luxury cars . The traveller community have blocked the staff car park and told hospital bosses they will 'move on shortly' A gleaming BMW thought to belong to one of the French travellers sits in the car park reserved for doctors . A visitor to the hospital said: 'Someone could suffer because a doctor is late for their shift.' Terry Jones, 64, who was visiting a relative in hospital, said: 'Someone could suffer because a doctor is late for their shift. 'It just just shouldn’t be allowed to happen. 'It may not be politically correct to say it but these people never seem to think about the impact it will have on the rest of us. 'I hope they realise what a nuisance they are causing to the staff and move on soon.' Not moving on yet: It is hoped that the travellers will move on by the middle of the week . Newport City Council said the creation of permanent sites for gypsies and travellers in the region went out to consultation last month as part of their local development plan (LDP). The final version of the plan will go before full council later this year and will be submitted to the Welsh Government for examination. This weekend the Mail told how French police moved 90 Roma gypsy families on from a large camp on the edge of the city of Marseille in the south of France. A ghost town of ramshackle huts, rubbish, wood and piles of tyres was left after the travellers moved on, days after police in Greece removed a blonde girl from Roma gypsies in Greece who claimed to be her parents, despite DNA tests proved that this was not the case. The blonde girl, known only as Maria, has been taken into care while Greek police - who found a handgun and balaclava at the house of her adoptive parents Hristos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, try to trace her real parents. Travellers at rest: One hospital worker said they found it 'infuriating' that they had to wait for them to move on .","Staff car park at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport blocked by caravans .

"ASBO: Magistrates took the unprecedented step of banning Matthew Gonshaw from visiting Scotland for ten years during the breeding season . A man has been given the first  ‘wildlife Asbo’ after an obsessive  campaign of stealing rare birds’ eggs. Magistrates took the unprecedented step of banning Matthew Gonshaw from visiting Scotland for ten years during the breeding season. Dubbed ‘public enemy number one’ by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,  the jobless 49-year-old is one of the country’s most prolific egg stealers. He amassed a collection of more than 700 rare eggs from endangered breeds including  golden eagles and ospreys. Some had contained live chicks, but he killed them by drilling a small hole in the egg and stored the shells in elaborate display cases at his home in Bow, East London. In one raid, officers found the egg of . the rare black-tailed godwit. There are estimated to be fewer than 40 . breeding pairs left. Thief: A selection of the rare eggs stolen by  Matthew Gonshaw who was dubbed 'public enemy number one' by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds . Gonshaw, who has had 51  convictions over the past decade under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, was described in a previous hearing as having an encyclopaedic knowledge of birds. He is thought to have spent weeks living rough to monitor about 170 nests, making meticulous notes.  He appeared to be motivated only by trophy hunting and made no money from the thefts. Among the haul were 12 avocet eggs. The bird (above) is used for the RSPB emblem . Gonshaw was arrested on the island of Rum in the Hebrides last summer after police found detailed maps, climbing equipment and camouflage clothes in his home. He is banned from travelling to Scotland during the breeding  season from February 1 to August 31, Stratford magistrates ruled  last Friday. He is also banned from all RSPB land and any owned by the Wildlife Trust until 2022. Gonshaw, who lives on benefits, is thought to have been able to afford his excursions by hitch-hiking and living in the wild. If he breaks his ban, he faces a £20,000 fine or five years in jail. He is currently serving his fourth sentence for egg collecting, having been jailed in December. Mark Thomas, of the RSPB, said: ‘He has become a serial menace, targeting our rarest birds, such as the red kite and peregrine falcon, for a selfish desire to add to his collection. ‘Already being the only man in England to be denied the joy of visiting our nature reserves, he must surely realise it’s time to give it up.’ Pc Stephen Rodgers, of the  Met’s Wildlife Crime Unit, said that Gonshaw had ‘directly jeopardised Britain’s wildlife’.","Magistrates banned Matthew Gonshaw from visiting Scotland for ten years during .

"Sitting in traffic is not only a nuisance, it raises stress levels, causes us to breathe in harmful smog and makes us late for work. And, according to a new survey, the problem is only getting worse with almost every one of America's most clogged cities having more traffic in 2013 compared with 2012. It is perhaps no surprise to find that Los Angeles is still the most congested city in the U.S. For every hour travelled during rush hour, a whopping 39 minutes will be spent in traffic.

Honolulu is . a new entry at number four in the table, having not featured in last . year's survey, knocking Seattle down into fifth, despite the fact that . the city's traffic delays also got worse. Of the top ten worst cities for traffic, eight of them had longer queues in 2013 compared with 2012, with two of them not featuring in the previous survey. Out of the top 20, only three saw time spent in jams reduced, with citizens of Miami, Tampa and Houston able to catch a few more minutes in bed before their journey to work. Honolulu, Hawaii, is a new entry into the table at number four, having not featured last year. Commuters here can expect rush hour journeys to be 29 per cent longer than usual . The arrival of Honolulu has knocked Seattle from fourth to fifth place, despite the fact that delays got worse between 2012 and 2013 .

"A mother accused of the murder and neglect of her baby after she left him in her baking hot car for seven hours will go on trial today. Dr Karen Murphy, 40, from Virginia, was arrested in June last year after the body of her two-year-old son Ryan was found strapped into his car seat, where she had left him that morning. Murphy, a mother-of-three who owned a large veterinary practice, usually dropped Ryan at nursery on her way to work. Scroll down for video . Accused mother: Karen Murphy will go on trial today accused of the murder of her son after she left him in a hot car for seven hours . Vehicle: Murphy is accused of leaving her baby son in this minivan for seven hours where he died from the baking heat . But on June 17, when she got home at 4pm, she received a panicked call from her husband to say Ryan wasn't at the nursery when he went to pick him up. When she went to her car, Murphy found her son still strapped into the car seat where she had left him that morning. The mother is accused of leaving him in the searing hot car for seven hours while she was at work. He died from heatstroke. Her trial begins in Bristow, Virginia, today where she is accused of child neglect and murder. If convicted she faces a maximum of 40 years in jail. According to NBC, the June 17 incident was not the first time she had forgotten her son in the family's minivan. According to a search warrant, Murphy left her son unattended in the . vehicle outside work for about 20 minutes, and only realized he was . there when someone from the day-care center called Murphy to report her . son was absent. Karen Murphy was described as a 'pillar of the community' and a loving devoted mother . Murphy was described as a pillar of the community and was active in the local girl scouts group with her two pre-teen daughters. Since her arrest, many friends and family have rallied around her, calling her a devoted, caring mother who made a tragic and inexplicable mistake. At her previous court hearings, groups of supporters gathered outside the court. Her attorney will argue that the loss of her son and the guilt she will have to carry for the rest of her life is enough punishment. Edward MacMahon said: 'This was a tragic accident and not a crime. 'What she needs is to be supported and loved by the people who know and care for her and who know what a wonderful mother she is. 'In my judgment, she doesn't need to be prosecuted. She's doing everything she can to continue to be a good mother.' Family home: Murphy discovered the body of her son in the back seat of her car after she returned home from a day at work .

It gets to the point where it becomes neglect.' His decision to take the case to a grand jury was due to the fact Murphy had done this more than once. Family and friends have written messages of support on a Facebook page, which says: 'This page is a place to share your support for the loving, caring and compassionate mother Karen Murphy is.

"More questions: Jack Straw wants Ed Miliband to investigate Unite . Former home secretary Jack Straw has urged Ed Miliband to take action over fresh evidence that Unite union officials attempted to rig the vote in the selection of a Labour party candidate. Mr Straw said Mr Miliband ‘should actively consider re-opening the investigation’ into the selection process at the Falkirk constituency. Mr Straw spoke out after emails were published that suggested Unite and its official Stephen Deans were instrumental in thwarting Labour’s initial investigation into the vote-rigging claims. Mr Deans, who resigned from his job at the Grangemouth refinery on Monday after being accused of spending a quarter of his working day on union issues, is chairman of the Labour Party in Falkirk. The scandal erupted after four members of the Kane family complained that they had been signed up as party members without their knowledge. At the time, Mr Deans was trying to get Karie Murphy – a close friend of Unite boss Len McCluskey – selected as the Labour candidate. The party held an internal investigation but Unite was cleared of wrongdoing in September when the Kanes retracted their evidence. A police investigation was also dropped. However, emails printed by the Sunday Times suggest that Unite officials were instrumental in ensuring that the evidence was withdrawn. In one message, dated July 30, Unite executive Howard Beckett said Mr Deans would arrange for the retractions to be signed by the Kane family. Mr Deans is related to a member of the family. In a separate email sent on the same day, Mr Deans said he was ‘happy’ with the statements drawn up by Unite ‘and can get this to the Kane family and get it posted tonight’. Last night, Labour sources said they could not act against Mr Deans because Mr Miliband had not seen the full cache of emails but Mr Straw suggested that the party investigation should be reopened. Under pressure: Ed Miliband is being urged to re-investigate the claims of vote rigging by Unite union . He told the BBC’s Daily Politics programme that there was ‘a sufficient case presented by the Sunday Times for there to be further questions that will need to be dealt with’. He suggested that Unite’s grandstanding over Mr Dean’s fate led to the threat by Grangemouth owners Ineos to close the plant last week – a threat lifted after Unite boss Len McCluskey dropped opposition to a company rescue plan. 'Catastrophic tactics': Unite boss Len McCluskey . Mr Straw accused Mr McCluskey of ‘catastrophic tactics’ and said: ‘To be blunt about it, my analysis is that Len McCluskey downwards put internal union Unite politics before the interests of their members at the Grangemouth plant.’ Eric Joyce, the MP for Falkirk who resigned from Labour after a brawl in a House of Commons bar, said Mr Miliband was frightened of Unite, Labour’s biggest paymaster. He said: ‘The Labour Party is effectively keeping Deans in place, and I think it’s to some degree because of a substantial amount of fear inside the Labour Party of the Unite leadership.’ Mr Joyce said Unite was a ‘very great threat’ to the Labour party. ‘Unite came along and interfered with witnesses, and the inquiry was stopped in Falkirk,’ he said. ‘I think the Labour party should re-open the inquiry.’ But Andrew Murray, Unite’s chief of staff, said Mr Joyce had given a ‘wrong reading’ of the emails. He said that there was ‘no evidence’ that ‘anything untoward’ had taken place. Mr McCluskey said: ‘We are witnessing a witch-hunt against Unite and Stevie Deans. 'The published material I have seen shows no basis for reopening the Falkirk wound.’ But in a letter to Mr Miliband, Tory MP Bob Neill wrote: ‘People in Britain deserve to know whether or not you will be strong enough to stand up to Len McCluskey and Unite. 'If you do not, they will draw their own conclusions as to your fitness to lead the country.’","Jack Straw urge Ed Miliband to follow up fresh evidence over rigging .

"Chris Christie is the likely victor in today's gubernatorial election as he is leading his Democratic rival by 20 points and is expected to hold on to his job for another four years. That said, Christie was clear during the campaign that if he decides to run for an even bigger title- as he has been loudly considered a possible presidential nominee- he will have no problem leaving office before his second term as governor comes to a close. That admission would hurt many candidates, but not Christie as voting booths opened in New Jersey on Tuesday with him beating his Democratic rival Barbara Buono by a wide margin. Taking it all in: Mary Pat Christie laughs at the jokes that her husband Chris made to reporters after voting in Mendham, New Jersey on Tuesday . Happy day: Chris Christie is expected to win a second term as New Jersey governor when the state votes in their gubernatorial election today and he is leading by 20 points in the latest polls . Keep smiling: Barbara Buono went up against Christie after working as a state senator and she used her campaign to paint him as an ambitious conservative out for only himself . Casting her vote: Buono, with her husband Martin Gizzi standing behind her, signs in at the voting station . Mrs Buono was the first of the two to cast her vote, wearing a blue skirt suit and waving to fans at the Metuchen polling station. Christie commented for the first time about the fact that a member of Mitt Romney's campaign staff leaked the New Jersey governor's private vetting file to two reporters writing a book about the 2012 campaign. In the files, several potentially embarrassing disclosures were made about Christie's past including lawsuits and favoritism when it comes to awarding state contracts. 'When it came to light a few months ago that it had leaked, Mitt called me right away, and I could tell he was really embarrassed and outraged about it and I think thats the kind of reaction that the person in charge should have,' Christie said in an interview with CNN on Election Day. The authors of the book in question, Double Down, have not revealed their source but it had to be someone within Romney's inner circle. Christie brushed off the issue, but said that it was clearly a reflection of someone's feelings against him and not the handful of other Republicans vetted by Romney's team who had similar files. 'There's nothing in there that I have a huge problem with and it seems it only happened to me,' he said. Christie spent much of the past week traveling across the state in an effort to ensure voter turnout, and if his supporters cast their vote, he may become the first Republican governor to win a state-wide office by more than 50 per cent since former President George H.W. Bush did so in 1988. Christie was last seen on Monday, making the rounds at a series of campaign stops including one photo opp at a bakery in Hillside. The Republican's weight has been an issue of public debate ever since he was considered as a possible Vice Presidential candidate for Mitt Romney last year. 'I feel really good,' Christie told CNN's Jake Tapper on Election Day. 'We're a little more than halfway to my goal in the last 8 months and I sleep better and the biggest difference to me is that I didn't feel badly at my previous weight but I didn't realize how badly I slept which is bad for my staff because I have more energy than I did before which I didn't think was possible.' He has repeatedly brushed off the . concerns about his health by saying it is a personal issue but he also . announced in May that he had undergone lap-band surgery two months prior . to help combat his obesity. As . part of his campaign, Christie allowed his doctor to give a report on . his health status saying that the 51-year-old has been 'losing weight . steadily' since the February operation. 'Governor . Christie has normal blood work, normal cardiovascular test results, and . good functional capacity,' said Dr Rachana Kulkarni. Get in there: Governor Chris Christie shakes the hand of a worker at the Oasis Pastry Shop in Hillside, New Jersey during a campaign stop on Monday, just hours before polls open in his re-election bid . Steering clear: The Republican governor's weight has been a concern for some political operatives and may have been a contributing factor for why he was passed over in the choice of Mitt Romney's vice presidential selection . Being good: Since having lap-band surgery in February, Christie's doctor said that he is half way towards his weight goal but would not disclose what that number was . The doctor would not give a specific figure to CBS News during an interview last week, but did say that Christie is 'more than halfway' to his goal weight. While his weight has largely been an issue for critics, but a new book that gives a backstage look at the 2012 election reveals that it is something that his allies thought about as well. Christie was listed as part of Mitt . Romney's short list for vice presidential candidates, and the campaign . tell-all 'Double Down', as reported by Time, shows that the candidate's team used fish-themed nicknames for each of the secret subjects. As such, Christie was given the moniker 'pufferfish'. Facing off: The latest poll has Christie beating his Democratic opponent Barbara Buono by 20 points . Many directions: Even if he is re-elected on Tuesday, he has said that he would consider running for President in 2016 which would force him to leave the governorship before his term ends . The latest poll conducted by Monmouth University reported by PolitickerNJ, has Christie beating his Democratic opponent Barbara Buono by 20 points, with him winning the race 57 per cent to 37 per cent. The presumed victory comes as little surprise as Christie is popular on both sides of the aisle and received some record-breaking approval numbers following his handling of Hurricane Sandy. His campaign staff were not the only ones who expected a victory, as the Democratic Governor's Association only spent $5,000 to support his competitor.","Governor Chris Christie is running for re-election and polls open Tuesday .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was relentlessly heckled over the Benghazi terrorist attack as she tried to deliver a speech at a New York university on Wednesday night. Clinton was speaking at the University of Buffalo as part of the university's 'Distinguished Speakers Series' when a man in the crowd began screaming about the attack that left three people dead, including Libyan Ambassador Chris Stevens. 'Benghazi, Benghazi - you let them die,' the man screamed as Clinton continued to give her speech. 'You let them die': Clinton is confronted by a heckler during a speech in Buffalo on Wednesday . Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January, famously asking 'What difference does it make?' whether Benghazi was a terror attack or the result of a protest that spun out of control . After about 40 seconds of yelling Clinton appeared to acknowledge the screaming man. 'We . have to be willing to come together as citizens to focus on the kind of . future we want, which doesn’t include yelling. It includes sitting down . and talking to one another,' she said sternly. The crowd then erupted with applause. The heckler isn't the only person who blames Clinton for the attack - the mother of one of the four Americans killed in the . attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya told CNN's Jake Tapper . earlier this year that she also blames Clinton for her son's death. Pat . Smith's son, State Department Information Officer Sean Smith, was one . of the four Americans who perished when Islamic terrorists destroyed the . consulate compound on the eleventh anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in . New York City and Northern Virginia. 'You blame Secretary of State Clinton?' Tapper asked Smith? 'Yes,' she replied. 'Why was there no security for him?' Smith asked. 'When they were supposed to have security and the security that they did have was called back. It just - things do not add up and I'm just told lies' The US consulate compound in Benghazi was reduced to a burnt-out shell after armed terrorists attacked. Hillary Clinton and others in the Obama administration are under fire for failing to prevent the attack, and for covering up its causes . 'Why did it happen? And she is in charge. Why couldn't she do something about it? I blame her.' 'That's . her department,' she explained. 'She is supposed to be on top of it. Yet she claims she knows nothing. ""It wasn't told to her."" Well, who is . running the place?' Smith . said the U.S. State Department has refused to give her details about how . her son died, even insisting that she's not entitled to information . because she's 'not part of the immediate family.' 'I still remember the labor pains,' she said. 'I . got one telephone call from a clerk that was a couple days after it . happened. He was reading to me from the time line, which I already had. And that was it.' Three whistle-blowers testified in a . House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing about . what they saw and heard before, during and after the terror attack that . killed Smith's son. Smith alleged that the Obama administration has been engaged in a dishonest cover-up since the attack killed her son and three other Americans, including the ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens. 'Why was there no security for him?' she asked. 'When they were supposed to have security and the security that they did have was called back. It just - things do not add up and I'm just told lies.'

"Mitt Romney last night stood by remarks secretly recorded at a campaign fundraising event in which he said that 47 per cent of Americans are dependent on government and that 'my job is not to worry about those people.' Referring to Obama supporters, Romney said: 'All right, there are 47 per cent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. 'That, that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax.' He added that 'my job is not to worry about those people -- I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.' Scroll down to hear the leaked recording . Controversy: Romney said his plan is to create jobs -- not government dependency -- for the '47 per cent' Leaked: Mother Jones, a liberal news magazine, says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser . Blunder: The resulting outcry is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the Republican lost the race to the White House . Romney added to the controversy by referring to his family's Mexican heritage and saying if his father George had been 'born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this'. He then made a further reference to how voting based on race favours the Democrats, saying: 'We are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, we're in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.' In a hastily-arranged evening press conference in California, Romney said that Obama believes in 'a government-centred society' whereas the Republican nominee believed in a 'free people, free enterprise, free market' society and had an approach that would put 23 million people back to work. He added that 'my campaign is about helping people take more responsibility' and 'getting people back to work.' Romney conceded only that his sentiments were 'not elegantly stated' because he was 'speaking off the cuff.' But it will be difficult for Romney to rebut charges that he is contemptuous of almost half the population and has no desire to persuade them or win them over. VIDEO: Mitt Romney reacts to the undercover filming from MotherJones . The timing of the release of the clip -- 50 days before the election -- could make it even more damaging than the 2008 audio of then-Senator Barack Obama saying at a 2008 fundraiser that rural voters 'get bitter, they cling to guns or religion'. Obama made those comments in the April of election year when he was already all but guaranteed to win the Democratic primaries. He then had seven months in which to overcome them. The Obama campaign was quick to exploit the potential political bombshell of the Republican nominee effectively writing off almost half the country. Facts: Romney has statistics on his side when it comes to the 47 per cent comment - only 53 per cent of Americans pay federal income tax after deductions and rebates . In a statement reacting to the secret recordings, Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, said: 'It's shocking that a candidate for President of the United States would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the American people view themselves as ""victims"" entitled to handouts, and are unwilling to take ""personal responsibility"" for their lives. 'It’s hard to serve as president for all Americans when you’ve disdainfully written off half the nation.' In an initial attempt at damage limitation, . Gail Gitcho, Romney’s communications director, said in a statement: . ‘Mitt Romney wants to help all Americans struggling in the Obama . economy. The campaign did not dispute the authenticity of the clip. Gracious host: Hedge fund manage Marc Leder threw the $50,000-a-plate fundraiser where Romney made the comments . ‘As the . governor has made clear all year, he is concerned about the growing . number of people who are dependent on the federal government, including . the record number of people who are on food stamps, nearly one in six . Americans in poverty, and the 23 million Americans who are struggling to . find work. Mitt Romney's plan creates 12 million new jobs in four . years, grows the economy and moves Americans off of government . dependency and into jobs.’ The videos, posted on YouTube, were obtained by Mother Jones, a left-wing magazine. Romney's 47 per cent figure seems to have come from a Tax Policy Center report that found 46.4 per cent of American households paid zero income taxes or received a net refund from the government. This leaves 53.6 per cent of households shouldering the nation's entire tax burden. When the report was released, some Republicans took up a rallying cry of 'the other 53 per cent' -- a response to the Occupy movement's 'the other 99 per cent' slogan. The startling figure is the result of a number of tax loopholes -- mostly credits given to the elderly and the poor. But Romney appeared to mix up the 47 per cent of people who did not pay income tax -- many of whom pay state and local taxes and payroll taxes -- with the proportion of core Obama supporters. Many of of those who don't pay income tax are Republican supporters -- particularly working class white men and the elderly. According to David Corn, who wrote the Mother Jones article, the video was filmed at a $50,000-per-plate fundraiser thrown by hedge fund manager Marc Leder. Battered: The Obama campaign quickly jumped on the statement saying Romney 'disdained' half of the nation . No responsibility: Romney claimed he could never convince Obama supporters to 'take responsibility for their lives' The New York Post reported last year that Leder, worth an estimated $400million, threw an end-of-summer bash in the Hamptons last year where 'guests cavorted nude in a pool and performed sex acts, while scantily clad Russian women danced on platforms. Dancers at the party also twirled flaming torches to booming beats.' The May fundraiser in Boca Raton was part of a two-day sweep through Florida that netted Romney $10million in two days. South Palm Beach County campaign chairwoman Bonnie Re told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel at the time that the fundraiser was a success. 'He really ad libbed a lot,' she said. 'He's loosening up so much more each time I see him.' New . York magazine’s Daily Intel reported that former President Jimmy Carter’s grandson helped . unearth the footage. James Carter IV is credited . as a research assistant on the Mother . Jones piece that broke the story. Carter . spends much of his time searching for video clips of Republicans. Once . he discovered the video on YouTube, he put the owner of it in contact with Mother Jones, who he has worked . with before. Buzz Feed's McKay Coppins writes that the comments reveal Mitt Romney is a true conservative. 'Romney's condemnation of America's entitlement society -- and his assessment that Obama voters are part of the problem -- fit firmly into contemporary movement conservatism, and seem to demonstrate an internalization of the Republican Party narrative about meritocratic success,' the Buzz Feed article says. Standing by his words: At a press conference on Monday, Romney said his remarks were 'not elegantly stated,' but did not back away from the message . In the tapes, Romney also referred to his family heritage in Mexico and joked that if his father George had been 'born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this'. The tape emerged as the GOP nominee spoke at US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles in a bid to erode the strong advantage among Latinos enjoyed by President Barack Obama. But in comments very different from those to the Chamber, Romney told wealthy voters at an event that has not been identified by the anonymous film maker, Romney made light of the problem he has attracting Hispanic voters. 'My dad, as you probably know, was the governor of Michigan and was the head of a car company,' he said. 'But he was born in Mexico ... and uh, had he been born of uh, Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this. But he was unfortunately born to Americans living in Mexico. He lived there for a number of years. I mean, I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino.' At the same event, he dismissed Obama voters as freeloaders who pay no taxes, don't take responsibility for their own lives and who expect government to take care of them. Talking about his wealth, Romney said: 'I have inherited nothing. There is a perception, ""Oh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything"" and so forth. Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in America.' Romney told the donors that 'women are open to supporting me' but that 'we are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, we're in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation'. When one contributor asked how those present could help Romney sell himself to others, he replied: 'Frankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars.'","Romney says voters support Obama because they depend on government .

He later suggested . in an emailed statement that all three buildings had been targeted, . saying the attack came 'near the Ariana Hotel, the important CIA base, . and also the presidential palace and Ministry of Defense.' Mujahid claimed the attackers had . inflicted 'heavy casualties,' but Afghanistan's Kabul division army . commander Gen. Kadam Shah Shahim said he knew of no deaths among . security forces or civilians. He said his forces killed all of the attackers, three or four men who had jumped out of a car and opened fire. BBC correspondent Bilal Sarwary said militants were locked in clashes with President Hamid Karzai's bodyguards, as well as security personnel from the nearby ministry of defence and a CIA station. Police had no immediate comment, the Associated Press reported. The attack comes after President Karzai expressed concern that the US had engaged in peace talks with the Taliban. Lt. Col. Frank Hoelzner, a spokesman for the NATO coalition, said he had . no immediate information but that the headquarters had not been . affected by the attack. The Taliban have indicated they are willing to open peace talks with the . U.S. and the Afghanistan government and just last week opened an office . in Qatar for possible negotiations. But at the same time they have not renounced violence and attacks have continued across Afghanistan. Meanwhile Afghan officials say a minibus has hit a bomb buried in the road in the southern province, killing 11 members of a family. Kandahar governor's spokesman Ahmad Jawed Faisal said That the bus hit the device on a road northwest of Kandahar city at about 7:45 a.m., killing eight women, two children and a man. Two other men were also wounded. Faisal says all of the victims were relatives but that he had no further details. Reinforcement: Afghan security forces arrive to the site of an insurgent attack .

"The names of blue chip companies that used rogue private detectives will finally be revealed next week. MPs have given police a five-day deadline to release the list of 102 law firms, insurers, financial companies, banks and celebrities. If they fail to do so, the names will be published in Parliament on Monday. Ultimatum: Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said he would publish the list of names next week if Soca refused to do so . The MPs are furious that the Serious Organised Crime Agency has refused to identify the organisations who were clients of corrupt investigators. The move could spark a major row between Parliament and police, who handed the list to the Commons home affairs committee on condition of strict confidence. Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who is chairman of the committee, issued the deadline to Soca at a stormy meeting yesterday. His colleagues warned Soca that, by . appearing to be protecting the identities of the big businesses on the . list, they were giving the impression of ‘injustice’. It . was pointed out to police chiefs that, when journalists had been linked . to phone hacking and other illegal practices, police had pursued them . relentlessly. The logo of the Serious Organised Crime Agency which gave the list of names to MPs on condition they would not be published . But, in the four years since Soca discovered that big business and lawyers had – often indirectly – been clients of rogue detectives  little or nothing has been done. Mr Vaz told Trevor Pearce, Soca’s director general, and Stephen Rimmer, the agency’s interim chairman, that he would publish the list on Monday if Soca did not do so first. ‘The committee has taken the view that this list should be published,’ he said. ‘We would like you to publish the list. We see nothing wrong with you publishing the list. ‘We know it has gone to the Metropolitan Police and we know they have removed the names that are subject to criminal investigation. ‘We give you until Monday to publish this list, if you fail to publish it on Monday, we will publish it because we think it is in the public interest to do so. We’ve taken legal advice.’ The ‘blue-chip hacking’ list was drawn up during Soca’s Operation Millipede, which led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year. Twenty-two law firms feature alongside several insurance companies, financial services groups and two celebrities. Up to 100 individuals may have had their details accessed by the private investigators, Mr Pearce previously admitted. Conservative MP Michael Ellis asked him yesterday: ‘The impression is given in some quarters that it’s alright to pursue journalists for offences or alleged offences but not so when it comes to large City institutions or any other entity that might be of a different nature. ‘So isn’t it in the public interest also to avoid those sort of impressions being created, of injustice? ‘There is also public interest in not giving the impression that there is an uneven scale of justice applying to different entities. ‘We have to protect the wider interests of justice here and that includes that justice be seen to be done as well as actually being done.’ The Northampton North MP added: ‘Why shouldn’t the public know the names? Four rogue private detectives used a range of deception techniques to obtain bank account and mortgage details, medical records and information from the Police National Computer . ‘There doesn’t seem to me to be any issues of national security or other issues pertaining to the wider national interest.’ The MPs even suggested Soca had not checked whether its board members hold directorships or receive other payments from the 102 firms on the list. If any links are confirmed, this could constitute a major conflict of interest, the MPs said. Last night, a Soca spokesman said: ‘We have made our position clear, but in light of the request from the committee we will seek advice and inform the committee of our decision by Friday.’ Millipede resulted in the jailing of rogue private detectives Daniel Summers, Philip Campbell Smith, Graham Freeman and Adam John Spears. The four men used a range of deception techniques to obtain bank account and mortgage details, medical records and information from the Police National Computer. MPs said names on the list had begun to leak out – with six firms publicly identified last month.They were the accountants, Deloitte, banks Credit Suisse and Chase International, and legal firms Richards Butler, Herbert Smith and Clyde & Co. There is no evidence they knew of any criminal activity. Deloitte and Clyde & Co denied hiring private investigators who acted illegally. The other four named companies declined to comment. Earlier this week, it emerged that – after a four-year delay – the firms on the list are to face an investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office. The maximum penalty any of the companies and individuals involved could face if successfully prosecuted for data protection breaches is a fine. Some would not face any court action, however, because they are based abroad.","List of 102 client of private investigators includes law firms, insurance companies and celebrities .

"Environmental campaigns have maintained for years that sonar systems used by shipping leads to the stranding of whales. But now international research has confirmed their concerns for the first time that whales strand themselves on beaches when they are lost and disorientated by high-frequency underwater noise. An independent scientific review panel . found the systems, mainly used for underwater mapping, were responsible . for the mass stranding of 100 melon-headed whales in Madagascar in 2008. An independent scientific review panel found that sonar systems, mainly used for underwater mapping, were responsible for the mass stranding of 100 melon-headed whales (pictured) in Madagascar in 2008 . A recent study by the Cascadia Research Collective based in Washington, said underwater military sonar could be killing blue whales. The reserachers said  that baleen whale species, which include the world’s largest animal, the blue whale, react to the mid frequency noises by changing behaviour. This includes altering foraging so they miss out on high-quality prey, which could make them weak and decimate numbers through starvation. The soundwaves, developed by the military to track enemies beneath the waves, are between 1 and 10 kHz, which is within the human hearing band. They have been blamed for lethal mass stranding of deep diving toothed whales. Sonar is thought to disrupt the animals’ diving behaviour so much  that they suffer a condition rather like ‘the bends’ which human divers can contract if they surface too quickly.This research claims that sonar can significantly disrupt their foraging and dramatically decrease feeding efficiency as undersea noise blocks animals’ communication. Teams from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) were able to rescue some of the whales, but it was too late for many of them. While aspects of the stranding in Madagascar remain unknown, the panel concluded that a multi-beam echosounder system, operated intermittently by a survey vessel moving down the shelf-break the day before the event was the most 'plausible and likely behavioral trigger for the animals initially entering the lagoon system.' There are now concerns about the impact of noise on marine mammals as the systems are commonly used by many industries. A report commissioned by the panel said: 'The potential for behavioural responses and indirect injury or mortality from the use of similar MBES [multi-beam echosounder systems] should be considered in future environmental assessments, operational planning and regulatory decisions.' The noise from the high-frequency sonar . systems, used by the military, shipping and research vessels, can cause . the animals to swim into the wrong areas, and it is thought that use of the system leads to beachings in the UK too. Every year 800 whales, dolphins and porpoises are stranded on British beaches, although it is not known whether sonar systems are to blame. Here, British Divers Marine Life Rescue volunteers inspect a with a 44ft Sperm whale, which died on Redcar beach in Cleveland in 2011 . Every year 800 whales, dolphins . and porpoises to be stranded on British beaches, although it is not known whether sonar systems are to blame. Dr Howard Rosenbaum, director of the Ocean Giants Program for WCS, welcomed the report and said: 'These conclusions add to a mounting body of evidence of the potential impacts of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals. 'Implications go well beyond industry, as these sonar systems are widely used aboard military and research vessels for generating more precise bathymetry (underwater mapping). 'We now hope that these results will be used by industry, regulatory authorities and others to minimise risks and to better protect marine life, especially marine mammal species that are particularly sensitive to increasing ocean noise from human activities.' The noise from the high-frequency sonar systems, used by the military, shipping and research vessels, (pictured is the sound room of HMS Westminster in Portsmouth) can cause whales to swim into the wrong areas, and it is thought that use of the system leads to beachings in the UK too . Katie Moore, director of animal rescue at IFAW said: 'Mass stranding response is challenging under the best of circumstances. 'Together with local individuals and the government of Madagascar, we provided the expertise to rescue as many animals as possible and medical care to those that stranded alive. 'Equally important was to gather as much data as possible from the animals to address the root cause of the stranding. We are pleased to see the ISRP report and its conclusions, which will hopefully be used in shaping future conservation policies.'","An independent scientific review panel .

"An Ohio man who confessed on YouTube to killing a Navy veteran while driving drunk declared 'it should have been me' in court today before he was sentenced to 6 1/2 years prison. Matthew Cordle, 22, had faced up to 8 1/2 years in prison for killing father Vincent Canzani in a wrong-way crash after a night bar-hopping with friends in June. 'Whatever my sentence may be, there's no fair sentence when it comes to the loss of a life,' Cordle told the judge before the sentence was handed down. Franklin County Judge David Fais sentenced Cordle to six years for aggravated vehicular homicide and six months for driving under the influence of alcohol. He also revoked his driving privileges for life. Scroll down for video . Sentenced: Matthew Cordle, right, sits before a judge during sentencing Wednesday, October 23, 2013, in Columbus, Ohio. The  judge sentenced Cordle to 6 1/2 years in prison for causing a fatal wrong-way crash after a night of heavy drinking . Cordle apologized to the family of his victim, Vincent Canzani, who was killed in the June crash. 'It should have been me that night, the guilty party, instead of an innocent man,' he said. His guilty plea last month came just a week after he was indicted in a speedy process absent of the numerous court filings that usually cause such cases to drag on for weeks or months. Canzani's daughter asked Fais for the maximum sentence. 'My father got a death sentence and did nothing wrong,' Angela Canzani told the judge. Vincent Canzani was a talented artist and photographer who enjoyed working out and spending time with friends and family, she said. She said her children and her sister's children will never get to see their grandfather again. 'It should have been me': Matthew Cordle reaches in his pocket for a statement which he read to the court during sentencing . Disgusted: Angela Canzani, pictured left, the victims daughter, and Matthew Cordle's father, Dave Cordle, right, address the court on Wednesday. Cordle said he was 'disgusted' at his son's actions and Canzani pushed for a maximum sentence . The judge also read a letter from Vincent Canzani's ex-wife who said she believed Vincent Canzani would not have wanted a maximum sentence. She said she believes Cordle will keep his promise never to drink and drive again. Cordle's father, Dave Cordle, told the judge he was 'disappointed, disgusted and heartbroken' at the choices his son made that night. He did not ask for leniency, and told Canzani's family his heart was filled with sorrow at their loss and hopes someday they can forgive his son. In a 3 1/2-minute video posted in early September, Cordle admitted he killed a man and said he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive that night. 'My name is Matthew Cordle, and on June 22, 2013, I hit and killed Vincent Canzani,' he says somberly. 'This video will act as my confession.' Cordle acknowledged having a drinking problem after the crash and entered a treatment program as prosecutors gathered evidence against him. He told his attorneys early on that he wanted to plead guilty but made the video against their advice. Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of . his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy . (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left) Wreck: In this undated photo provided by the Columbus Police Department, the pick-up truck driven by Cordle is seen at the crash site . Prosecutors say a heavily intoxicated Cordle denied causing an accident or killing anyone when he was first taken to a hospital after the crash, in which he suffered broken ribs and a fractured skull. His attorneys say he may have suffered a brain injury. Cordle, who lives in Powell, a Columbus suburb, told Fais last month that he had no recollection of the crash, how much he'd had to drink that night or whether he'd had anything to eat. 'I drank so much I was blacked out,' Cordle said at the September 18 hearing where he pleaded guilty. Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said he believed Cordle's remorse in the video was genuine, but he said any further interviews would be self-serving. He also disputed Cordle's assertion in the confessional video that he could have fought the case against him, which O'Brien called 'a slam dunk.' O'Brien sought the maximum sentence of 8 1/2 years. Cordle's attorneys asked for a sentence that was fair. The video posted on YouTube has been viewed more than 2.3 million times. It begins with Cordle's face blurred as he describes how he has struggled with depression and was simply trying to have a good time with friends going 'from bar to bar' the night of the accident. He then describes how he ended up driving into oncoming traffic on Interstate 670. Cordle's face becomes clear as he reveals his name and confesses to killing Canzani. He ends the video by pleading with viewers not to drink and drive. Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident . Cordle's conduct after the crash suggests a long sentence is not needed for him to understand the seriousness of what he did, according to the filing late Wednesday in Franklin County court. That conduct included Cordle's decision to plead guilty as soon as possible without the usual months of back-and-forth court filings challenging evidence. 'A fair sentence is imperative in this case in order to send a message to other offenders and society that taking responsibility and trying to make something positive come from such a horrendous tragedy is an exemplary way to face such a tragic situation,' defense attorneys George Breitmayer and Martin Midian wrote in the filing. Cordle pleaded guilty last month to charges of aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in the June death of Vincent Canzani of suburban Columbus. At the time of the crash, Cordle's blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit of 0.08. He . faces eight years for the homicide and six months for the drunken . driving - which likely would be folded into the overall sentence – and a . $15,000 fine as well as loss of driving privileges for life. Cordle's . online video confession, made against the advice of lawyers and . released in early September, has been viewed more than 2.2 million . times. County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien, who has until Friday afternoon to respond, has said he plans to seek the maximum. Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone . His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video . 'I'll . be, at the time of sentencing, in a position of showing the kind of . sentences given in this county for people that get large amounts of . alcohol in their system and kill people, and it will not be a four-year . sentence,' O'Brien said September 18, the day Cordle pleaded guilty.

"Ministers came under fresh criticism for their handling of the NHS last night after it emerged  the ambulance service will be hit with £90 million in fines – as punishment for the chaos blighting casualty departments. Critics said the fines will simply deprive trusts of vital funds that could help tackle the deterioration in patient services. A new penalty clause that was written into ambulance trust contracts from last month will levy fines of £200 for every patient who has to wait for longer than 30 minutes for admission to A&E, and £1,000 for each patient forced to wait more than an hour. Closures: The devastating impact of casualties shutting across the nation . Delays: The ambulance service faces millions of pounds in fines if patients cannot be delivered to A&E units . But acute overcrowding in A&E . departments has led to increasing ambulance ‘jams’ formed as they queue . to unload, with waits of four hours recorded at some hospitals at the . busiest times. Damning new . figures reveal that during the past year there were more than 265,000 . occasions in England when ambulance staff took more than half an hour to . deliver patients into the hands of hospital doctors. Doctors and MPs have vowed to fight ‘disastrous’ new plans to close two more A&E departments that will affect more than a million people. The proposals come despite growing concerns about  over-burdened emergency departments across the country, with record attendance figures and soaring waiting times. NHS bosses have tabled plans to close A&Es at hospitals in Epsom, Surrey, and St Helier in nearby Carshalton – even though they are highly regarded by patients. It means eight A&Es within the M25 are now threatened with closure, joining a growing list nationwide. Proposals to downgrade Epsom and St Helier A&Es to ‘urgent care centres’ were slipped out on the website of an NHS review panel for South-West London called Better Services, Better Value. Some of these UCCs are staffed only by nurses. Consultant-led maternity services at St Helier could also go. The review panel says that concentrating services at three hospitals in the region is necessary because the existing five are failing to meet quality standards. Centralising will mean senior staff are available round the clock, it says. The plan is to beef up  GP surgeries and other ‘community services’ to stop people going to A&E. But Paul Burstow, Liberal Democrat MP for Sutton and Cheam, said: ‘Proposing the closure of A&E and maternity at St Helier without a clear idea of how the GP and community services will be improved is a recipe for disaster. ‘It will shunt more people  into what are already busy and often overloaded A&E and maternity units.’ He is being supported by other MPs, including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Tory MP for Epsom and Ewell, who says the plans would mean ‘cannibalising’ two hospitals to ‘bolster’ the remaining three, in Kingston, Croydon and Tooting. In England and Wales, at least  14 hospitals have either closed their casualty wards or have cut their services. A further 14 A&E departments are under threat of being closed down or merged. By Stephen Adams . And shockingly, more than 37,000 patients had to wait over an hour to move on to the wards. Official guidelines say ambulances should deliver patients, clean the ambulance and be back out on the road within 15 minutes. A longer wait is seen as ‘unsafe’. Yet the chaos in A&E departments is so bad that at one, the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, doctors were forced to put up a  tent to act as a makeshift ward to treat patients alongside the ambulance queue. If the ‘handover delays’ continue at their current level then the ambulance trusts will have to find nearly £90 million to pay to the Department of Health over the next financial year. The fines were introduced after NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson said last year that he would like to see handover delays treated as ‘never events’ because of their impact on patients. Fewer than a third of trusts hit their target of achieving a 15-minute turnaround in 95 per cent of cases. In London, where the situation is at its worst, the 15-minute target is missed in nearly half of all cases. Last night Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said that depriving one part of the Health Service of money as a ‘punishment’ for delays beyond its control was divisive and counterproductive. ‘This is a clear sign of the chaos . that is now engulfing the NHS,’ he said. ‘People expect to see the NHS . pulling together to protect patients. They do not expect to see one part . of it fighting another. ‘A&E . departments across the country are reaching crisis point. Thousands of . nursing posts have been lost, leaving hospitals understaffed. David . Cameron has slashed council budgets to the bone, resulting in cuts to . home care and support, leaving elderly patients stranded unnecessarily . in hospital beds. ‘Hospitals can’t move patients from A&E through to wards so ambulances are unable to discharge patients. ‘Now, to top it all, hospitals are having to pay thousands of pounds in fines because of the delays. ‘This . is no solution and it will only make matters worse. These are problems . made in Downing Street, not in our hospitals. It is David Cameron’s . toxic medicine of budget cuts and top-down reorganisation that has . brought the system to its knees. ‘He . urgently needs to get a grip and sort out this crisis. This money . should be used to put nurses in our hospitals not paid out in fines.’ Queues: Problems in A&E are causing  some patients waiting over an hour to be moved into hospital . The region with the greatest number of handover delays was London, which had 63,962 delays longer than 30 minutes. Of these, 4,240 were over an hour. If that is repeated this year, the trust will have to pay more than £17 million in fines. West Midlands Ambulance Service faces . the highest fine – more than £20 million – if it repeats its 63,426 . delays. Its fine would be the highest because an alarming 8,010 of these . were longer than an hour. Critical: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said fining ambulance services was divisive and counterproductive . The best performance came from the South West Ambulance Service (North), where just 10,596 delays of more than 30 minutes were recorded last year. Even this performance would see the trust hit by a fine of £6.4 million. Delays at A&E mean ambulance crews may be prevented from attending other emergencies, if paramedics are stuck in corridors or in their vehicles with patients waiting for a nurse or doctor to take over. Although procedures are in place to ensure that those whose lives are in danger can be fast-tracked into hospital ahead of those not at immediate risk, critics say patient care is still seriously jeopardised. Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb, who as North Norfolk MP has observed the problems of the Norfolk and Norwich first-hand, said: ‘The situation with ambulance handovers has been unacceptable, and can mean that they miss their response times to other incidents. 'We have got to try to understand why the demand for A&E services is going up so much.’ Last night, a spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘We believe that everyone should be seen quickly when they arrive at hospital, even more so when they arrive in  an ambulance. It is unacceptable for patients to be left waiting in ambulances outside hospitals. ‘The NHS needs to ensure it has proper plans in place to deal with high demand and we are doing everything we can to support the service in treating patients as swiftly as it can.’ Tens . of thousands of readers have backed The Mail on Sunday’s campaign . against A&E closures since it was launched last September. We have received a total of 32,074 protests from our readers – 17,290 coupons, 9,745 emails and 5,039 text messages.

Aspirational families seeking to live within the catchment area of a good state primary face price hikes of 40 per cent on similar properties in the same county. But parents who wish their youngsters to be able to walk to the country’s top independent primaries must pay an extra 170 per to buy homes nearby. Middle class parents are prepared to pay up to 170 per cent property price premiums to live close to Britain's top primary schools, a new study has found . Those near Cambridge fee-paying St John's College School pay 160.8 per cent more . The study calculated the premiums on house prices in the postcodes of the top 50 fee-paying and top 50 state primary schools outside London, against the average property price for the county. And the results revealed the financial lengths pushy parents will stretch themselves to in order to get their children into Britain’s best schools. While independent schools do not have a catchment area, well-heeled parents often prefer to move close-by so they will benefit from a shorter morning school run in the car or enable their children to walk. Justin Marking, of estate agent Savills, said: ‘We see that competition is huge to get into good primary schools and parents are keen to make a pre-emptive strike and move close to put themselves in the right place before their children reach school age.’ Janette Wallis, of The Good Schools Guide, said: ‘For the first child, the primary school seems to be the be-all and end-all. ‘It’s natural for all parents with their first child to want the best school for them. It can feel crucial and it is very important. ‘Parents might use private prep schools in areas where there are grammar schools in the hope that an early spend will lead to a grammar place.’ In Cheshire homes located near Bollin Primary School in Altrincham cost an extra 156.4 per cent, the study found . The independent Dragon School in Oxford, whose former students include actors Emma Watson and Hugh Laurie, commands the highest premium at 169.5 per cent, with properties in the street worth an average of £1 million. Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu and author JRR Tolkien, are among a host of well-heeled parents who have sent their children to the £6,000-a-year school. Parents who wish to live near Cambridge fee-paying St John’s College School and Kings College School must pay 160.8 per cent more to similar properties with the average price of houses in the street almost £900,000. In Cheshire homes located near Bollin Primary School in Altrincham cost an extra 156.4 per cent, the study found. The average value of a property in the same street as the school is £620,000. In Kent heavy rush-hour traffic in Tunbridge Wells has prompted huge demand for homes close to independent Holmewood House School. In neighbouring Sevenoaks the inclusion into the catchment area of popular Amherst Junior School of a difficult-to-sell property instantly prompted offers in excess of £1million. Separate research by Lloyds Bank found property prices close to England’s top 30 state secondary schools were on average £31,500 - 12 per cent - higher than neighbouring areas. The study found that nine out of the top 30 state schools were in locations where house prices were as much as £80,000 more than similar properties in surrounding areas.","Dragon School in Oxford commands the .

"A 15-year-old girl collapsed and died from a suspected heart attack while playing in a football match yesterday. Melissa Smith was playing for Cadley FC when she collapsed on the pitch in a match against Euxton Girls FC U16s, in Greenside, Lancashire. A defibrillator and CPR were used by match officials at the scene before an ambulance arrived. She was pronounced dead at Royal Preston Hospital. Melissa, a pupil at Penwortham Girls' High School in Preston, had played for the team for five years and was described as a 'lively, energetic and thoughtful' girl. Melissa Smith died while playing for Cadley FC (pictured) in a league match against Euxton Girls FC U16s . Melissa, a 15-year-old school girl from Penwortham in Preston was described as 'lively and thoughtful' Steve Flynn, club chairman for Cadley FC, said: 'Everyone at the club is deeply saddened, it is a big shock. 'All of teams have been informed and we have been overwhelmed with the outpouring of support we have received from other teams in the league.' He continued: 'She was really conscientious and thoughtful - so much so that she rang the team manager when she was on her way to say she was running late. 'We are just all in shock and can't imagine what her family must be going through.' He said as a mark of respect to Melissa, all Cadley FC games across the league will be postponed next weekend. A statement from Cadley FC said: 'Today one of our Under 16's girls collapsed during a football match and despite everyone's efforts medical staff were unable to resuscitate her. 'We are all devastated by the news and our thoughts are with her family, friends and team mates at this sad time.' As a mark of respect to Melissa, all Cadley FC games across the league will be postponed next weekend . The tragic incident happened at around 11.30am yesterday at the Greenside playing fields in Euxton, Chorley, home of Euxton Girls' football team (pictured) Players, spectators and parents were left devastated by the tragedy, which happened around 11.30am during the under 16's Premier League game. Lancashire Police said her death is not being treated as suspicious and a post-mortem examination will be carried out to established the cause of death. Opposition coach Mick Walsh said: 'It happened just before half-time. There was nobody around the girl at the time but she suddenly fell to the ground between the halfway line and the penalty box. 'We got the defibrillator and tried CPR while the ambulance was called. 'We all hoped and prayed that she'd make a full recovery but it was to no avail. 'Our thoughts are with Cadley FC and the family. I've been involved in football for 40 years and nothing like this has happened before - and I hope it never happens again.' Melissa had played for the team for five years and was also said to be a supporter of Preston North End . Melissa was a pupil at Penwortham Girls' High School, the only non-selective, non-fee paying girls’ school in Lancashire . Euxton Girls' chairman Dennis Winn said: 'We're absolutely devastated and our deepest sympathies go out to Cadley FC and the family of the young girl. 'We only bought the defibrillator this year and never expected to have to need it but it was all in vain.' Euxton FC have also cancelled next week's game as a mark of respect. Today, Karen Pomeroy, head teacher at Penwortham Girls High School, paid tribute to the pupil. She said: 'We are heartbroken to have lost such an enthusiastic and warm-hearted girl. Melissa was so bubbly, so full of life, and she will be greatly missed by the entire school community. 'She was a shining star on stage, known for her wit and valued for her contribution to the wider life of the school. Melissa went out of her way to care for others and we will all feel her loss deeply. 'We know how much she will be missed by her many friends, and we will make sure we look after all our girls at this very sad time. 'Our thoughts are also with Melissa’s family and we have already been in touch with them to offer our sincere condolences.' Last night, friends and sports personalities paid tributes poured to Melissa. Bethany Finlayson wrote: 'RIP beautiful. Can't believe you're gone. It all seems so unreal. Always had a smile that can make anyone's day better. Taken far too soon.' Another friend, Livi Briggs, wrote: 'Rest in peace gorgeous, you were one of the nicest people.' The sudden collapse of Fabrice Muamba in a football match between Bolton and Tottenham shocked the footballing community . Since Marc-Vivien Foé collapsed while playing for Cameroon in the 2003 Confederations Cup, a number of professional players have suffered fatal cardiac arrests. In 2007, Sevilla's Antonio Puerta in 2007 and  Motherwell's Phil O'Donnell died after suffering a cardiac arrest against Dundee United in 2007. Two years later, Espanyol defender Dani Jarque died while on a pre-season tour in Italy. In 2012, Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest during Bolton's FA Cup tie against Tottenham. He suffered a cardiac arrest in the 31st minute and received treatment on the pitch before being rushed to hospital. He survived. Most recently, Piermario Morosini died after suffering a cardiac arrest in a Serie B match for Livorno against Pescara. Since the 19th century more than 80 footballers are known to have died suddenly while playing. BBC broadcaster Jacqui Oatley wrote on Twitter: 'This is heart-breaking. A teenage girl dying while playing football in Lancs. Thoughts with Melissa's family.' Tributes were also paid on Cadley FC's Facebook page, including many from local amateur football teams. Every week in the UK, 12 apparently fit and healthy young people, under the age of 35, die from undiagnosed cardiac conditions. The defect is usually due to an inherited condition rather than a general lack of fitness. Indeed sport stars may be at greater risk because intense activity can significantly increase a person's risk of heart attack if they have a heart abnormality. Dr Steve Cox, the Cardiac Risk in Young's Director of Screening, has called for more screening. He told MailOnline: 'In Italy, where there is mandatory screening in place, there has been an 89 per cent reduction in sudden deaths in young people, so we feel it's important. 'While it is fantastic that defibrillators are available, it's not the answer to saving young people's lives. It's not enough when a young person collapses. We need to identify the problems before then and can help by prescribing certain drugs, or warning off certain medication. 'We are very passionate about the idea that all young people from 14 onwards are offered the chance to be tested and it's even more important if they are involved in sport.' In March 2012, former England U21 international Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest during an FA Cup match between Bolton and Tottenham. It took 78 minutes for Muamba's heart to start working on its own again before he was carried off on a stretcher and rushed to the London Chest Hospital. He has made incredible progress since and now works to raise awareness on cardiac health. In another incident that rocked the footballing world, Marc-Vivien Foé, then a player for Manchester City, collapsed while playing for Cameroon in the 2003 Confederations Cup and suffered a fatal cardiac arrest.","Melissa Smith died playing for Cadley FC when she collapsed on the pitch .

"A grand jury has decided not to charge anyone in an alleged sexual assault near Ohio University that was photographed and filmed by witnesses, a prosecutor said Monday. Athens County Prosecutor Keller Blackburn said the grand jury determined there wasn't probable cause to file charges after a man and woman were photographed in a sex act against the front window of a bank near the southern Ohio campus in the early hours of October 12. Explicit photos of the two were circulated via social media, and the woman later told police she was a victim of a sexual assault. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Tweeted: The photo Blanc posted, which MailOnline has cropped, shows the man kneeling down and performing a sex act on the woman against a wall . Investigators determined the couple, . both 20-year-old students, had alcohol from a bar before the sex act, . Blackburn said in a statement Monday. Blackburn said the man asked the woman whether to stop the act when a crowd formed, and she said no. The . man has cooperated with police. The woman didn't remember what . happened, and testing showed no sign of any 'date rape drug,' Blackburn . said. He said the couple wasn't aware at the time that their act was being filmed. 'Every . decision we make now has the potential to be placed on Twitter, . Facebook, commented on, shared and embellished, making life today more . public than ever before,' Blackburn said in the statement. 'If a lesson exists from this case, let it be that we should behave as if our family is always watching.' Spreading the word: Twitter and Instagram users posted about the alleged incident not knowing that the woman has since reported it to police as a sexual assault . University . President Roderick McDavis had said the school would conduct its own . investigation and, if appropriate, would take action to hold people . accountable. He said . that some of the response within the university community had been . divisive and that he hoped instead it would inspire greater caring at . the campus about 70 miles southeast of Columbus. The . video and picture quickly became a national news story, provoking . outrage at those who did not intervene and some bloggers it seems . started hunting for the woman - claiming that she had only filed a . sexual assault suit because she was embarrassed at the footage. However, . not only did the shameful web users go after the potential victim of a . sexual assault - they also identified the wrong girl. Journalism . student, Rachel Cassidy, was wrongly named on Twitter as the woman in . the now notorious images and video of a girl being pinned against a wall . while a man performed oral sex as passers-by only stopped to film it. Incorrectly identified: Rachel Cassidy was . falsely named as the alleged victim of a sexual assault on October 12th . at Ohio University Homecoming that was filmed and uploaded to the . Internet . Vile: This is the Tweet that named Rachel Cassidy as the girl involved in the rape claim after she was filmed on the street at the Ohio University Homecoming . Rachel . was named by @Anon_Central — a popular Twitter account with over . 170,000 followers as the alleged victim days after the incident and was . accused of being a 'liar' only interested in saving her own 'ass'. However, . Rachel has come forward to explain that she is '100 percent' not the . woman involved and that she was nowhere near the incident at Chase Bank, . 2 S. Court St., on Saturday, October 12th. Police officers have also confirmed that she was not involved. One of the individuals who stood and videoed the incident was named and shamed by the MailOnline earlier this month. Vance Blanc, 19, tweeted the image the morning after with the caption: 'So I witnessed this the other night. This is the photo.' Blanc sent it to @Huntermoore, who is the man behind the notorious now shuttered 'Revenge Porn' website Anyone Up? Shame: Vance Blanc, a 19-year-old college . student, is one of those being criticized for failing to step in and act . while the alleged sexual assault was occuring. Instead he's among a . handful of people who posted pictures online . He . also tweeted it at @68StewartSt, a user who goes by the name of The . Animal House who seems to be an OU student who puts on parties. When the story went viral Blanc was initially belligerent and tweeted: 'You don't wanna get embarrassed? don't do stupid shit.' He later took down the image and apologized, claiming to be 'ashamed.' The explicit photos of the alleged assault were taken and shared on social media after the college homecoming celebration. The . woman seen receiving oral sex in the photos and videos reportedly had . no idea what happened to her until the next morning when she saw the . photos online. Many of the photos of incident have been taken down by the Instagram users who originally posted them, but news sites like Buzzfeed republished them. The . woman in the photos contacted the police the day after the incident and . reported that she had been a victim of sexual assault to the Athens . police department. Close for comfort: The photos suggest the alleged sexual assault took place against the Chase bank on Court Street which is about a block away from the police department . In one . of the most graphic photos- which shows the man kneeling in front of the . woman as she leans against a Chase bank- makes it clear that there were . onlookers just feet away from the incident as it was in progress. Blanc wasn't the only one to witness the incident. 'Still . can believe a dude was ****** *** on court street Saturday night in . front of like 10 people,' a different Twitter user wrote. Not only was the scene of the alleged crime a busy street but it was also one block away from the police station. While police were still investigating the case, the community was already going on the attack. 'Some . of us are really angered and disappointed that no one intervened and . they just filmed it,' Allie Erwin, a student at Ohio University who . leads an anti-rape group on campus, said at the time. 'Their . first impulse was to share it on social media and make a mockery of . something that was probably the worst thing that’s ever happened to her. There are other people who saw it as her asking for it and think it’s a . joke. Basically they're slut-shaming her for what happened,' she said . according to Metro. 'The response on social media is kind of heartbreaking, how harsh and cruel people are being.'","A grand jury determined there wasn't probable cause to file charges after a man and woman were photographed in a sex act near Ohio University .

"It could have made him a billionaire – well, even more of a billionaire than he already was. But when Bill Gates’s engineers brought him an e-reader in 1998, he told them to forget about the ‘unimportant’ device. The Microsoft founder rejected the gadget, which featured a touchscreen, because he thought the future lay with keyboards. Today, most modern gadgets eschew physical keys for touchscreens – although the original Amazon Kindle, which has fuelled the e-book boom, did indeed include a keyboard. Ouch: Microsoft founder Bill Gates (left) dismissed the idea of a touchscreen e reader like the Amazon Kindle (right) in 1998, but the devices have since become a multi-billion pound industry . A programmer involved in Microsoft’s . e-reader project told US magazine Vanity Fair that Gates also complained . about the device’s interface ‘because it didn’t look like Windows’, the . operating system that made him his fortune. The comments were made for an upcoming . story about the 'downfall' of Microsoft, which is scheduled to hit . newsstands later this month. The gadget was dismissed as ‘unimportant’, and the engineers working on it were told to come up with something else instead. The e-book market in the UK alone is . now worth an estimated £243million, with digital revenues accounting for . 8 per cent of all book sales last year. Years later, Microsoft engineers also . failed to see the potential in Instant Messaging on the Internet, which . has now become incredibly popular. One engineer failed to see why people . would just want to write a few words on screen - which is exactly the . formula Twitter has used to become a success. Short-sighted: Gates, pictured here in 1995, turned his nose up at a touch-screen device because he wanted everything to go through Microsoft Office, which used a keyboard . Cashing in: The fortunes of Microsoft are in stark contrast to those of Apple, which under Steve Jobs (pictured) took a leap of faith with touchscreen products such as the iPhone and the iPad (above). The iPhone now makes more money than all of Gates' products combined . Gates' decision puts him among a circle of business leaders who have made bad . decisions which have looked so bad in hindsight they have become . comical. Among them is . former Decca A&R man Dick Rowe who famously said no to The Beatles . in 1962 and claimed 'Guitar groups are on their way out'. In . 1876, William Orton, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company, . wrote a letter to inventor Alexander Bell rejecting his invention . because it was a 'toy' with 'no commercial possibilities'. The invention in question was the telephone. Microsoft's . fortunes are in sharp contrast to those of Apple which until his death . last year was led by Steve Jobs, who was considered far more willing to . take risks than Gates. Nowadays, Apple's iPhone makes more money than all of Microsoft’s products combined. Ironically, . Amazon's Kindle e-reader, which launched in 2007 and is now the most . successful in the world, did not come with a touch screen and had an . in-built keyboard and small joystick to navigate around the screen.

"Positive signs: Nelson Mandela is 'showing great improvement', according to his ex-wife . Nelson Mandela is showing a 'great improvement' in his health from a few days ago, his ex-wife said today. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela gave the update on the former South African president while speaking to media outside Mandela's former home in Soweto. 'I'm not a doctor, but I can say that from what he was a few days ago there is great improvement,  but clinically he is still unwell,' said Madikizela-Mandela, who is also a member of South Africa's Parliament. Members of Mandela's family and South African Cabinet ministers have visited the hospital where the 94-year-old is critically ill. It comes after his daughter said yesterday that he was responding to touch and trying to open his eyes, adding: 'He's still there.' Makaziwe said that when she went to see him in hospital he was still responsive and conscious. 'I won't lie, it doesn't look good,' she told SABC. 'But if we speak to him, he responds and tries to open his eyes. He's still there. He might be waning off, but he's still there.' Mr Mandela's granddaughter Ndileka said he was 'stable' and thanked the well-wishers from around the world who have sent their support. The whole family had been summoned to his bedside yesterday and president Jacob Zuma was believed to have been seen entering the hospital. 'I cancelled my visit to Mozambique today so that I can see him and confer with the doctors,' Mr Zuma said in a statement. 'He is much better today than he was when I saw him last night.' In the Eastern Cape . province, where Mr Mandela grew up, a traditional leader said that the time was . near for the former leader, who is also known by his clan name, Madiba. 'I am of the view that if Madiba is . no longer enjoying life, and is on life support systems, and is not . appreciating what is happening around him, I think the good Lord should . take the decision to put him out of his suffering,' said the tribal . chief, Phathekile Holomisa. 'I did speak to two of his family . members, and of course, they are in a lot of pain, and wish that a . miracle might happen, that he recovers again, and he becomes his old . self again,' he said. 'But at the same time they are aware there is a limit to what miracles you can have.' Scroll down for video . Positive: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,  the ex-wife of Mr Mandela, tells the media that while he is improving, he was clinically still unwell . Looking on the bright side: Winnie also thanked the media for their support when she made her statement outside his former home in the Johannesburg township of Soweto . Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj . told the state broadcaster: 'Over the past 48 hours, the condition of . former president Madiba has gone down.' A South African newspaper has also reported the icon is on life support, citing numerous sources close to the family. The Citizen newspaper says Mr Mandela has a team of doctors supporting him at a Pretoria hospital. One source was quoted as saying that his family had the option to switch off the ventilator. Consolation: Mr Mandela's daughter Makaziwe, pictured right outside the hospital, said he was 'still there' but admitted that his condition 'doesn't look good' Family: The leader's granddaughter Ndileka arrived clutching a large bouquet of flowers . Mr . Zuma cancelled a trip to neighbouring Mozambique, intensifying . speculation about the deterioration of Mr Mandela's condition. The . president made his decision not to leave the country after visiting the . 94-year-old late yesterday in the Pretoria hospital where he has been . receiving treatment for a lung infection for nearly three weeks. 'Clearly . the issue of seriousness has been such that President Jacob Zuma has . cancelled his trip,' Mr Maharaj told Talk Radio 702. He declined to comment on reports that Mandela was on life support, saying: 'I cannot confirm any clinical details.' Peaceful: 95 children released balloons outside the hospital in honour of Mr Mandela, whose 95th birthday falls next month . Admiration: Two people look at the tributes to Mr Mandela left outside the hospital where he is being treated . CNN also reported that the former president could no longer breathe unaided, quoting an official who 'had been briefed in detail on his condition'. George Bizos, one of Mr Mandela's closest friends and his former lawyer, told The Daily Telegraph that they had never discussed his wishes towards the end of his life. 'We . can only hope for the best, and that is what the doctors decide to do,' he said. 'I am sure that the members of the family are discussing the . matter with the doctors but it should probably be primarily the doctors . in consultation with the family if the situation is critical.' Last night a leading clergyman visited Nelson Mandela's bedside to offer prayers for his 'peaceful, perfect end'. Thabo Makgoba, the Archbishop of Cape . Town, issued an emotional statement asking that the former president of . South Africa, who is in a critical condition, be released from pain and . suffering. Visit: Barack Obama holds his daughter Sasha's hand as the he and his family land in Dakar, Senegal . However, Mr Mandela apparently opened . his eyes and smiled when he was told about Barack Obama's forthcoming . visit to the country, according to his daughter. The statesman was able to . show his pleasure at hearing of the U.S. President's visit. Mr . Obama is believed to be keen to meet Mr Mandela, but given the delicate . condition of the African leader he will not do so unless he is invited . by the Mandela family. That prospect appeared to be more . likely after Mr Mandela's daughter Zindzi described how she . told her father that Mr Obama would be touring South Africa. After she told him 'Obama is coming,' she said, 'He opened his eyes and gave me a smile.' The . U.S. President arrived in Senegal yesterday and travelled to South . Africa today during his second trip to Africa since taking office. Speaking in Dakar, Mr Obama paid tribute to Mr Mandela and insisted his visit to South Africa would go ahead matter what. He said that the anti-apartheid campaigner had helped inspire him to enter politics with his bravery and self-sacrifice. Waiting: The balance of Obama's Africa trip could hang on the health of Mr Mandela . 'I think he's a hero for the world,' Mr Obama said. 'And if and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages.' Mr . Mandela has been in hospital being treated for a lung infection since . June 8. Mr Mandela, who became South Africa's . first black president after the end of apartheid in 1994, was . hospitalised for a recurring lung infection. This is his fourth . hospitalisation since December. Mandela . was jailed for 27 years under white racist rule and was released 23 . years ago, in 1990. He then played a leading role in steering the . divided country from the apartheid era to an all-race democracy. As a result of his sacrifice and peacemaking efforts, he is seen by many around the world as a symbol of reconciliation.","Winnie Madikizela-Mandela says there are positive signs from a few days ago .

"A photograph of servicewomen breastfeeding in public while wearing uniform has ignited a global debate. The picture shows two mothers, Terran Echegoyen-McCabe and Christina Luna, both in active service, nursing their babies on an Air Force base. The striking image has seen a flurry of comments, from supporters who say breastfeeding is a 'fundamental right' to another who compared it to 'defecating in uniform'. The photos were taken for the Mom2Mom Breastfeeding Support Group, set up by a military wife and mother-of-three to raise awareness of all women's rights to breastfeed in public. Proud: Servicewomen Terran Echegoyen-McCabe, left, breastfeeds her twin daughters while wearing her uniform alongside colleague Christina Luna and her little girl at Fairchild Airforce Base outside Spokane, Washington . Mrs Echegoyen-McCabe is pictured . breastfeeding her 10-month-old twin girls on her lunch break during a drill weekend as a member of the Air National Guard. By her side is friend Mrs Luna who feeds her toddler. Crystal Scott, founder of Mom2Mom, asked the women to pose for the support group she founded in January to help those who live and work at the Fairchild  Air Force Base outside Spokane, Washington. Mrs Scott has lived on the base for four years with her husband Kevin, an instructor, and their three children Gavin, ten, Aiden, four and one-year-old Roman. It was her idea to asked photographer Brynja Sigurdardottir to photograph the mothers in their fatigues ahead of National Breastfeeding Awareness Month in August. Following the photoshoot two weeks ago, the image of the military mothers breastfeeding was posted online and became a red-hot issue. Mrs Scott told MailOnline: 'We were not expecting it. We went to bed and the next morning, we were getting calls, comments and emails. Fired: Founder of Mom2Mom Crystal Scott, who posed with her son Roman, has been fired from her job as an X-ray technician because of the controversial campaign . Although there has been a rally of . support, one Facebook comment compared the image of the mothers in . uniform to 'urinating and defecating'. Mrs Scott said: 'No one can agree on everything and everyone is 100 per cent entitled to their opinion. 'But to compare breastfeeding to other bodily functions like defecating and urinating? It's disheartening and saddening.' She added: 'We've done nothing wrong. We're not disgracing the uniform, we are very proud. 'We can only hope that it brings positive changes not only for military but for women across the board to show them they don't have to hide in the closet.' There are currently no clear regulations as to whether or not a military member in uniform is allowed to breastfeed. We've done nothing wrong. We're not disgracing the uniform, we are very proud. Crystal Scott, founder of Mom2Mom Breastfeeding Support Group . There has been much confusion over this issue with some servicewomen being asked to move to private rooms while at the same time nothing has been said to women feeding their babies from bottles. The Mom2Mom Facebook page has been flooded with comments. Tracy Mueller Schoesler wrote: 'What strong beautiful women who are not just fighting for the freedoms of this country but for themselves and their children! Breastfeeding is a fundamental right in or out of an uniform!' One supporter Anna Krause commented: 'This is great. You are still A mom no matter what.' Another Jessica Emerick said: 'I . can't believe someone would have the audacity to judge or criticize this . photo, or any nursing mother. It's pitiful.' However there have been detractors. One fellow . soldier Rita Trujillo commented: 'I as one of many women who fought . long and hard to be accepted and respected as fellow soldiers and the . right to wear these uniforms feel shocked, angry at these published . photos.' Bringing about change: Trysta Chavez also posed for a photograph with her baby after seeing a lack of support for women breastfeeding in public . Statement: Mrs Chavez was among the women who allowed themselves to be photographed for a campaign for National Breastfeeding Awareness Month in August . Robyn Roche-Paull, a lactation consultant and a U.S. Navy Veteran wrote a book and has a blog called Breastfeeding in Combat Boots which aims to make women's position clearer while breastfeeding and serving their country. As she writes: 'There are NO polices or regulations in any of the military branches that either approve OR disapprove of breastfeeding in uniform.' She said that arguments against were based on the fact that it shows a woman to be nurturing and therefore 'unprofessional'. U.S. law states that a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a Federal building or on Federal property. The public affairs department at Fairchild Air Force Base did not respond to messages for comment left by MailOnline.","Air National Guards pictured nursing their children at Fairchild base, near Spokane, Washington .

"Men who recover from Ebola must abstain from having sex for three months or risk passing on the disease in their semen, health experts have warned. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the virus, which has claimed almost 7,000 lives in West Africa this year, can remain in a survivor's seminal fluid for 82 days. The WHO said: 'Men who have recovered from Ebola virus disease should be aware that seminal fluid may be infectious for as long as three months after onset of symptoms. 'Because of the potential to transmit the virus sexually during this time, they should maintain good personal hygiene after masturbation, and either abstain from sex (including oral sex) for three months after onset of symptoms, or use condoms if abstinence is not possible.' Scroll down for video . The Ebola virus can be carried in a survivor's sperm for up to 82 days, world health experts have warned . The World Health Organisation said four studies of 43 patients found three men who survived the disease still had the live virus in their semen for 40 days, 61 days and 82 days. Pictured, staff from the charity Doctors Without Borders, are seen carrying the body of a person killed by the disease . Four studies examining a total of 43 patients found three men who survived the disease still had the live virus in their semen 40 days, 61 days and 82 days respectively, after the onset of symptoms. Experts at the WHO said no case of sexual transmission of Ebola has been documented. They added it is unclear whether semen that tests positive for the virus is actually infectious. The four studies were carried out in different countries, and the first dates back more than 30 years. The disease is highly contagious, and is spread via bodily fluids including blood, saliva and faeces. More than 16,000 people are known to have been infected with Ebola since the current outbreak began in December last year. Of those, 6,928 people have died, according to the UN health agency. The virus causes haemorrhagic fever, and as yet there is no cure or vaccine. Almost all cases and all but 15 deaths have been in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - the countries hardest hit during this outbreak. In the last week the WHO reported 600 new cases across the three nations. Symptoms include fever, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting and in extreme cases, internal bleeding. Two months ago the WHO launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in West Africa. Experts aimed to isolate 70 per cent of victims in the three hardest-hit countries by December 1. New data reveals there have been a total of 16,169 cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and approximately three dozen cases elsewhere. Experts at the WHO said no case of sexual transmission of Ebola has been recorded . Liberia has recorded the highest number of cases and deaths, but the rate of infection is currently slowing there. In contrast, the disease is now spreading fastest in Sierra Leone. Out of the three West African countries, only Guinea was on track to meet the December 1 goal, according to an update from WHO. In Liberia, only 23 per cent of cases are isolated and 26 per cent of the required burial teams are in place. In Sierra Leone, about 40 per cent of cases are isolated while 27 per cent of burial teams are prepared and ready. The outbreak of Ebola was first reported in Guinea in March and spiralled out of control after being declared a public health emergency in August. Dr. Bruce Aylward, who is directing the World Health Organisation's response to Ebola, acknowledged in October that reaching today's goal would be 'really pushing the system hard'. He said: 'If we don't do it in 60 days and we take 90 days: No. 1, a lot more people will die that shouldn't; and No. 2, we will need that much more capacity on the ground to be able to manage the caseload.' In recent weeks, there have been some successes in curbing the deadly disease, with cases in Liberia and Guinea appearing to be declining or stabilising. However, the areas around Sierra Leone's capital and a district in the country's north are seeing a severe surge in cases. Oyewale Tomori, of Redeemer's University in Nigeria, who sits on WHO's Emergency Ebola committee, said failing to reach the  target now suggests Ebola will spread even further as capacities to respond become even more stretched. It comes as the death toll reaches almost 7,000 - all but around 15 deaths have been recorded in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia . Health workers wearing protective suits help a patients suspected of having Ebola to a treatment centre . 'We need to redouble our efforts to see what we can do to reduce the spread and catch up with the virus,' he said. 'Right now, it doesn't look good.' Dr. David Heymann, an Ebola expert who previously worked for the WHO, said: 'We hope that what we're seeing in Liberia will continue, but unfortunately what can happen with Ebola is that it can go to new countries, as it has already to Mali. 'The most dangerous thing would be if people now think Ebola is over and become complacent.' Earlier this month, the U.S. announced it was scaling back the size and number of Ebola clinics it had initially promised to build in Liberia, citing a drop in cases. The ultimate goal of WHO's plan now is to isolate all Ebola patients and provide safe burials by January 1. They believe that the number of deaths is likely far higher, given the difficulty in collecting comprehensive figures and with Ebola having a high fatality rate. The first case discovered in the current outbreak was in Guinea in December 2013. In Mali, the most recent county in the region hit by Ebola, the WHO spoke of eight confirmed cases, six of which had proved fatal. The tolls in Nigeria (eight fatalitie) and Senegal (one sole case) have remained unchanged for 57 days. Both countries have thus been taken off the danger list. People caring for the sick or handling the bodies of people infected Ebola are especially exposed. Health workers have been among the worst hit, with 340 deaths out of 592 cases. Outside of Africa, there have been four Ebola cases diagnosed in the United States one of which was fatal. There has also been one confirmed case in Spain, a nurse who has recovered.","The World Health Organisation said the virus was found in the semen of a survivor after 82 days during a study .

"Scientists could be on the brink of developing a cure for blindness, after regrowing corneas in the laboratory. The team behind the study at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Research Institute in the U.S. believe the milestone could help reverse a leading cause of blindness. A major breakthrough in stem cell research allowed researchers to grow the first known tissue from an adult stem cell. The scientists say their work offers hope to burn victims, victims of chemical injury and people with damaging eye diseases. Scientists at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Research Institute in the U.S believe they have made a breakthrough, regrowing corneas in a study which could pave the way for a cure for blindness . They have identified a way to enhance . regrowth of human corneal tissue to restore vision, using a molecule . known as ABCB5, which acts as a marker for hard-to-find limbal stem . cells. The research, published in the journal Nature, is also one of the first known examples of constructing a tissue from an adult-derived human stem cell. Limbal stem cells are found in the eye’s basal limbal epithelium, or limbus, and help maintain and regenerate corneal tissue. Their loss due to injury or disease is one of the leading causes of blindness. Previously, tissue or cell transplants have been used to help the cornea regenerate. But until now it was not known whether there were actual limbal stem cells in the grafts and outcomes were not consistent. In the new study, researchers were able to use antibodies detecting ABCB5, to pinpoint the stem cells in tissue from dead human donors and use them to regrow anatomically correct, fully functional human corneas in mice. The team at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Research Institute managed to identify a molecule known as ABCB5, which acts as a marker for hard-to-find limbal stem cells. Limbal stem cells help maintain and regenerate corneal tissue. Their loss due to injury or disease is one of the leading causes of blindness . The study’s co-lead author Doctor Bruce Ksander, who worked alongside Dr Paraskevi Kolovou, said: 'Limbal stem cells are very rare, and successful transplants are dependent on these rare cells. 'This finding will now make it much easier to restore the corneal surface. It’s a very good example of basic research moving quickly to a translational application.' Co-author Dr Markus Frank said: 'ABCB5 allows limbal stem cells to survive, protecting them from apoptosis [programmed cell death].' Dr Natasha Frank added: 'The mouse model allowed us for the first time to understand the role of ABCB5 in normal development, and should be very important to the stem cell field in general. 'A single lab cannot do a study like this. 'It integrates genetics, knockout mice, antibodies, transplantation - a lot of technical expertise that we were lucky came together in a very nice way.'","Scientists in the U.S. have successfully regrown corneas from stem cells .

"Cory Smoot, lead guitarist of the heavy metal band GWAR has been found dead on the group's tour bus. The body of the 34-year-old, who played under the sci-fi fantasy name of Flattus Maximus, was discovered following a gig in Minneapolis. His bandmates are said to be 'shocked and devastated' by his death. The cause is still unknown. Sci-fi fantasy figure: Guitarist Cory Smoot as his stage character Flattus Maximus . 'Talented': GWAR star Cory Smoot who had been with the band nine years . Lead singer Dave Brockie, known . as 'Oderus Urungus,' said in a statement: 'It is with a sense of profound loss that  GWAR must announce the passing of their long-time guitarist and beloved friend Cory Smoot, also known to thousands . of metal fans worldwide as Flattus Maximus,' 'At this point we are just . dealing with the loss of our dear friend and brother. 'Please give your thoughts and your prayers to Cory, his family, and all the people that love him.' He described Smoot 'one of the most talented guitar players in metal today.'The GWAR bus was close to the Canadian border when the shock discovery was made. The metal musicians, who dress up in . alien costumes and spew fake blood and goo on fans, are on a . six-week North American tour, which features three other bands - Every . Time I Die, Ghoul and Warbeast. They are  known for lampooning well known figures including Sarah Palin, Lady Gaga and Paris Hilton and singing vulgar lyrics. Band manager Jack Flanagan said there were no details on funeral arrangements, but GWAR will still perform today at Edmonton Event Centre despite the tragedy. Cory Smoot joined GWAR in 2002 and was the fifth guitarist to play the character of 'Flattus Maximus'. He is known as the one 'True Flattus' being the person who portrayed the character for the longest time. With his red face, white dreadlocks, dinosaur-head shoulder pads and reptile feet, he became a legend among metal fans. His talent as a producer came in handy as he loaned his skills to the recording of the band's albums War Party, Beyond Hell, Lust in Space (where he did lead vocals on the track 'Release the Flies', and the bands latest album Bloody Pit of Horror. Before GWAR, Smoot previously played with such acts as Misguided and Locus Factor and still played with Mensrea and his own solo project called the Cory Smoot Experiment. The band was founded by Brockie in Virginia in 1984. It has released 13 studio albums and EPs.",Riddle over heavy metal star who called himself the sci-fi fantasy character 'Flattus Maximus'
"The latest version of Google’s Android operating system, dubbed ‘Android L’, has been revealed. In a video, the new software is shown running on a Samsung Galaxy S5 and it highlights some of the system's new features including lock-screen notifications and non-invasive alerts. No official release date for Android L - rumoured to stand for Lollipop but also possibly Layer Cake - has been announced yet, but it is expected to be unveiled later this month. Scroll down for video . California-based Google's next operating system has been previewed in a video that shows a leaked version of the software. The software is shown running on the Galaxy S5 using Samsung's TouchWiz. Android L stops alerts such as phone calls from taking up the whole screen . The test build version of Android L was revealed by SamMobile. In the video, the site explores the app and shows off some of its various functionality. Each phone operator has their own slightly tweaked version of Android - with Samsung’s being called TouchWiz - but this video still reveals some of the features users can look forward to. Google has announced its next-generation Android software will prevent law enforcement officers and governments getting their hands on user information. Only people with passwords or passcodes for devices running Android L will be able to access the files on it. This means that if search warrants are served on Google for the customer's information, it won't legally be able to get hold of it. Google began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature of Android Jelly Bean. However, the tool was optional and many users either didn’t know how to enable the feature, or weren’t aware it existed. Any devices that upgrade to Android L next month will have this tool turned on by default. For starters, Samsung has done away with the blue background it previously used on its phones, instead now preferring white backgrounds. This seems slightly odd as lighter backgrounds use more power and thus drain more battery than darker ones - something Android L is attempting to improve, reports Pocket-Lint. Pulling down with two fingers on the screen now opens up a menu of shortcuts, and holding one will take you to that settings menu - such as the Wi-Fi screen. And as mentioned earlier, the lock screen now displays notifications such as messages and missed calls - but at the expense of widgets on previous versions of Android. Google has also redesigned the look of the operating system, which it calls Material Design. This includes a new look for Dialler, Messages, Memo, Clock and more. And another interesting new feature is heads-up notifications, which means that alerts no longer take up the whole screen. Known as Android L - which may stand for Lollipop or even Layer Cake - the software is the successor to KitKat used on current phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5 (shown). Google is rumoured to be gearing up to release Android L later this month . So, for example, if you’re playing a game and someone calls you, or your clock alarm goes off, an alert will appear at the top of the screen rather than covering the playing area. The clipboard has also been updated, and now keeps a history of saved screenshots and copied text. MirrorLink support for cars has also been brought in as well, allowing users to mirror the screen of their device on their car’s display. SamMobile add that the test version is still in its alpha stage, so it doesn’t run entirely smoothly, and there are a number of glitches to iron out before it's released.","Google's next operating system has been previewed in a video that shows a leaked version of the software .

"Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos has revealed that the penalty given against him in the defeat by Atletico Madrid further emphasised why he prefers the Premier League ahead of La Liga. The league leaders lost for the second match in a row against their near rivals in the first leg of their last-16 Copa del Rey clash on Wednesday, with the Spain international adjudged to have fouled Raul Garcia for the spot kick that gave Atletico the all-important lead.

"A grieving mother today released this harrowing photograph of her dying son as a warning to others about deadly legal highs. Keen sportsman Jimmy Guichard, 20, suffered a heart attack and severe brain damage within hours of taking one of the herbal substances. His mother Karen Audino said he was found unconscious next to an empty plastic bag from controversial legal high shop UK Skunkworks. Just 24 hours later Karen held her 'fit and healthy' son in her arms after the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life-support machine. Tragedy: Jimmy Guichard lying in his Dartford hospital bed minutes before his death after taking legal highs . The mother-of-three is now demanding a change in the law on shops like UK Skunkworks - a campaign backed by two Tory MPs. Karen, 42, who has launched a Facebook campaign, said: 'Jimmy was fit and healthy, even the doctors said his organs were perfect. 'I believe what he smoked caused this and I want those shops banned, so nobody else has to go through this pain. 'The first place he laid was in my arms, and it was the last place he was going to be.' Bereft: Jimmy Guichard with his sister Sam (left) and mother Karen at Thorpe Park in the month before he died . Supplier: The keen sportsman was found next to a bag from UK Skunkworks, a legal high chain (pictured is its website) The legal high was bought at a UK Skunkworks shop similar to this one in Canterbury, Kent . She added: 'I understand people are often quick to point blame and I'm not saying my son's death is wholly the shop's fault. 'Jimmy bought the drug and would have known the risks - a young boy in our town died when his heart exploded in his chest after taking a legal high. 'But these are dangerous substances and selling them on the high street encourages people to try them. 'I know you can get it online but people, like Jimmy, are just after a quick fix. 'There's no way he would have bothered to search online and pay for it and then wait for it to be delivered. It just wouldn't have happened. 'I just don't want his death to be a waste, I hope it will help in proving what these legal highs can do and get the laws changed on selling them.' Message: Jimmy and his niece Zoe, 6, who idolised him. The keen sportsman suffered a heart attack and severe brain damage within hours of taking a legal high . Jimmy, who had applied to join the Army, had recently moved from Donegal, in Ireland to Gravesend, Kent, to care for his cancer-stricken father Martin. He bought the legal high from UK Skunkworks shop in Chatham, Kent, on October 2 and was found collapsed on his bed just hours later. Painful loss: Jimmy, pictured here aged two, passed away just before midnight on October 3 . He regained consciousness after a heart attack but his brain swelled causing bleeding and severe brain damage. His mother, a fast food restaurant manager, dashed from Ireland to his bedside at Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford, Kent. Jimmy, who played for Donegal in the Irish sport of hurling, passed away just before midnight on October 3. A post-mortem has been carried and his family are waiting for the results of the toxicology report. Earlier this month student Matt Ford, 17, suffered a near-fatal heart attack after taking a legal high called Exodus Damnation he bought from another UK Skunkworks' shop. UK Skunkworks has insisted it took disciplinary action after the 17-year-old was sold the legal high in Canterbury, Kent, when its policy is to only serve those above 18. After that case Canterbury Tory MP Julian Brazier urged Home Secretary Theresa May to change in the law on the sale of legal highs. He wrote: 'Skunkworks's get-out clause for the sale is that the herb is not for human consumption, but their advice is to help you relax by burning the herbs in the home. 'I find these twisted semantics as repugnant as I am sure you do. Skunkworks, its fellow shops and its websites must be banned.' Fellow Tory Tracey Crouch, the MP for Chatham, Kent where Jimmy died, echoed his sentiments. She said: 'People need to understand the dangers of legal highs. Just because they are legal doesn't mean they're not harmful. 'The government needs to urgently review legislation around the sale and purchase of these substances.' UK Skunkworks, which has 21 green-fronted shops across the south of England, has defended their sales. A spokesman said there was no evidence that Karen's son who lived in Gravesend, Kent, bought one of their products, despite her claims. He said: 'Our sympathy is with Mr Guichard's family. 'We get all our products from an official supplier and they do not have any UK Skunkworks branding on them, neither do our bags. 'All our products are clearly labelled 'not for human consumption'. Our customers are closely monitored and we check IDs. 'If we feel that someone is going to ignore the warning we will not sell the product to them.' Shock: His mother today described how she held her 'fit and healthy' son in her arms after the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life-support machine . The company bills itself as 'the UK's premier one-stop shop for lifestyle accessories, smoking paraphernalia and adult fun!' It also boasts 'all of our products are completely legal in the UK as they do not fall under the Misuse of Drugs Act'. In a letter of reply to MP Brazier the company said: 'Calling for UK Skunkworks to be shut down is a pitiful attempt at dealing with the issues we face. 'We sell a wide range of popular products that are received very well by an adult market.' The legal highs sold by UK Skunkworks include the best-selling party drug benzo extreme, which some experts say can become addictive. Others are E-Scape, compared to ecstacy, and Pure Gold, amyl nitrate used to give a split-second head rush. For legal reasons Skunkworks insist their products are not for human consumption and sell them instead as 'plant food' or 'room odorisers'. The store claims that physical shops are the most 'responsible' way to sell them. The spokesman added: 'Online it's much harder to regulate. You can go online with dad's credit card, tick a box to say you're 18 and have anonymous delivery.'","Jimmy Guichard, 20, died in hospital within hours of taking a legal high .

"Dementia patients at a Cumbria hospital were left for hours without food, according to a damning report by health regulators. Those at the Ramsey Unit, in the grounds of Furness General,  waited hours to be fed in the morning, weren't given their medication at the right time and were offered little by the way of mental stimulation. Care Quality Commission inspectors also found a high number of patients had suffered falls due to a lack of staff to provide supervision. Dementia patients at The Ramsey Unit in the grounds of Furness General Hospital were left for hours without food, according to a damning report by health regulators . Staff . told inspectors that chronic staff shortages were impacting on their . ability to provide adequate care that fully met patients’ needs. Inspectors found a high number of patient falls due to insufficient staff to provide supervision. Patients were often left in bed without breakfast until late morning due to there being insufficient staff on duty. Patients . were not receiving their prescribed medications at the times they were . prescribed due to the length of time it was taking the registered nurse . to complete the medication round. A . number of patients were found to be at risk of weight loss and . malnutrition because of their condition - but inspectors were unable to see what food and fluids . patients had been given as food intake charts had not been filled in. In . cases where people lacked the capacity to consent, inspectors were . concerned the trust had not acted in accordance with legal requirements . and records relating to patients’ capacity were incomplete. Inspectors . were concerned there was very little stimulation for patients and were . told that there was no therapeutic input into patients’ care. The unit had extensive facilities- crafts room, sensory room and designed gardens but these were rarely used. The report, published today, identified major failures at the hospital and found the unit failed to meet government standards on staffing and patient care. It includes comments from . staff at the unit who said: 'The staffing levels are horrendous. We are . running around like headless chickens especially on the evening shift. 'We don’t have the staff to put people on the level of observation they need or to give the level of support they need.' The unannounced inspection by the CQC also found that patients were often left in bed without breakfast until late morning due to there being insufficient staff on duty. They were also not receiving their prescribed medications at the times they were . meant to, due to  the length of time it was taking the registered nurse . to complete the medication round. Many patients were also found to be at risk of weight loss and . malnutrition and inspectors were unable to see what food and fluids . patients had been given as food intake charts had not been filled in. Claire Molloy, chief executive of Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the unit, has blamed the 'target culture' of the NHS for the failings and promised changes. Ms Molloy said: 'We were all very shocked and concerned for our patients and staff when we heard the outcome of the CQC inspection. 'As the new Chief Executive, to hear that our patients are not being properly supported is very upsetting and something I never want to hear again. 'Our service was just not good enough. We’ve let down our staff and therefore we have let down our patients and for that we are sincerely sorry. 'It’s a real wake-up call for the trust and I am absolutely committed to ensuring this never happens again.' Patients at the Ramsey Unit were not offered regular stimulation, were not always given their medication at the right time and were sometimes left lying in bed all morning . Admissions to the Ramsey Unit were suspended on October 11 following the unannounced inspection by the CQC. Malcolm . Bower-Brown, CQC’s Regional Director for the North said: 'We were . shocked by what we found at the Ramsey Unit and have warned the trust . that improvements must be made. 'The trust had agreed to voluntarily to suspend admissions to the ward until they had fully addressed all areas of concern – the unit reopened to admissions on 18 November. 'In the meantime, we continue to monitor the trust extremely carefully, working closely with NHS England, to ensure that the required improvements are implemented. 'We will not hesitate to take further regulatory action, should this be necessary to ensure patients receive the quality of care and support they are entitled to expect.' The trust responded to the criticisms by increasing staffing levels at the unit by 25 per cent. It is also reviewing its internal assessment process and working to improve communications between management and staff. After the CQC visit the unit (pictured) was briefly closed to new admissions. It has now reopened with 25 per cent more staff . Dr Sara Munro, interim director of . nursing, has conducted a learning review into how the trust failed to . notice the problems at the unit. She said: 'The review found that the early warning systems were not good enough, there was lots of information available but it was not presented in a way that meant problems were easy to spot.' Ms Molloy added: 'Being part of an NHS organisation means we have a lot of performance targets. 'There is a historic culture that makes it more challenging to view things through a quality and safety lens. 'What we’re trying to do now is turn that tanker around and ensure quality and safety are what drive everything we do. 'We have to use the report to make sure that this never happens again. 'The CQC report can act as a catalyst to make changes happen.'

"An unusual planet, six times the size of earth, that is located 40 light-years outside our solar system, has been found to have a 'water-rich' atmosphere that has a strange 'plasma form' of water, scientists have said. Japanese astronomers examined the atmosphere of the alien planet using specialist cameras with a blue filter to observe planetary transits of super-Earth Gliese 1214 b. The research team said that while its atmosphere is water-rich, the planet is not habitable like our Earth, as it has atmospheric temperatures that reach 280 degrees Celsius. An unusual planet, six times the six of earth, that is located just 40 light-years outside our solar system, has been found to have a 'water-rich' atmosphere that has a 'plasma form' of water, astronomers have said. Here is an artist's rendition of a transit of GJ 1214 b in blue light. The blue sphere represents the host star GJ 1214 and the black ball in front of it is GJ 1214 b . While the planet's atmosphere contains water, it is still dramatically different to the Earth's . The scientists from the National Astronomical Observatory in Japan had set out to determine whether the planet has an atmosphere of water or hydrogen and used Subaru Telescope's two optical cameras with a blue transmission filter to study the scattering of light from the planet. They then combined their findings with previous observations in other colours to conclude the atmosphere contains 'significant' amounts of water. Principle investigator Norio Narita, told Space.com: 'As the temperature and pressure are so . high, water is not in a usual form (vapor, liquid, or solid), but in an . ionic or plasma form at the bottom the atmosphere - namely the interior - . of Gliese 1214 b.' The alien planet, which is located some 40 light-years away from our solar system in the constellation Ophiuchus, orbits a cooler star than our sun. Artist's rendition of the relationship between the composition of the atmosphere and transmitted colours of light of an alien planet. Top: If the sky has a clear, upward-extended, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, Rayleigh scattering disperses a large portion of the blue light from the atmosphere of the host while it scatters less of the red light. As a result, a transit in blue light becomes deeper than the one in red light. Middle: If the sky has a less extended water-rich atmosphere, the effect of the Rayleigh scattering is much weaker than in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Bottom: If the sky has extensive clouds, most of the light cannot be transmitted through the atmosphere . But it is around 70 times closer than the Earth to its sun and makes its journey around the low-mass star once every 38 hours. As is is so close, temperatures on the huge planet can reach a staggering 280°C or 540° Farenheit, but it is the planet's density that is surprising. While Gliese 1214 b is six times as large as earth, it is less than three times in width to be as big as a planet in between the size of Earth and Neptune. Dr Narita said: 'At high pressure and high temperature, the behaviour of water is quite different from that on the Earth.' While astronomers believe water is an essential ingredient for Earth-like life on a planet, and Gliese 1214 b has plenty of water, Dr Narita does not not think it is habitable because of its close orbit. 'Although water . vapour can exist in the atmosphere, liquid water - namely oceans - would . not exist on the surface of this planet. So unfortunately, we . do not think this planet would be habitable.' As the planet does not have a solid surface, it is difficult to estimate the height of the atmosphere, but the scientists think it could be around 30km - around three times deeper than our Earth's. They also believe plasma water could be hidden inside the planet but are unsure if they will ever be able to find the high pressure ices inside the super-Earth that they suspect are there. The unusual planet was originally discovered as part of the MEarth Project, which tracks over 2,000 low-mass stars.","Japanese astronomers examined the atmosphere of the alien planet using specialist cameras with a blue filter .

"One of Princess Diana’s ornate dresses is set to fetch up to £80,000 at auction. The ballgown from the Emmanuel 1986 'Diaghilev' collection has been described by Kerry Taylor Auction House, who are selling the ballgown, as 'arguably one of . the most ornate, romantic of all Princess Diana’s gowns'. Shimmering with gold . sequins, crystals and pearl beads the dress was inspired by Leon . Bakst's designs for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and it comes with a matching headband, . optional sleeve panels and petticoat. Fairytale: The Emanuel's ball gown from their 1986 'Diaghilev' collection has been described by Kerry Taylor Auction House, who are auctioning the gown, as 'arguably one of the most ornate, romantic of all Princess Diana's gowns' (R) Princess Diana wearing the dress at the Royal Charity Premiere of 'Ivan the Terrible' at the Royal Opera House . The Princess first caught sight of this dress, which will go under the hammer on December 3, at a Red Cross benefit fashion show in the summer of 1986. She selected it from the twelve glittering gold and white creations that the Emanuels had sent for the occasion. Unusually, the Princess acquired the show model, rather than specially commissioning another gown from the designers. The standard size 10 dress fitted her perfectly and Diana chose to wear the gown on many occasions, wearing it with and without the petticoat, and with and without the sleeve panels but often choosing to wear a diamond tiara instead of the headband. She was photographed wearing it on July 4 1986 to attend a banquet for a State visit of Richard von Weizsaker, the President of the Federal Republic of Germany at the time. On this occasion she chose to wear a glittering diamond tiara to accessorize the gown, but wore no petticoat which produced a slimmer look and revealed her ankles. Intricate: Shimmering with gold sequins, crystals and pearl beads, it comes with a matching headband (R), optional sleeve panels and petticoat . On July 22 1986 (a day or two before the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of York) she wore the dress to the Royal Opera House for a performance of 'Ivan the Terrible' by the Bolshoi Ballet. On this occasion she also wore the padded headdress, sleeve panels and petticoat – the complete ensemble. She was also photographed in the gown when she attended the premiere of the James Bond film 'The Living Daylights', almost a year later, at the Odeon, Leicester Square on June 29 1987 (with the wide layered petticoat). The Emanuels were the favourite designers of the Princess during the 1980s and this particular dress is estimated to fetch between £50,000-£80,000 when it goes under the hammer. Other loved items by the label included a white chiffon blouse which Diana wore for her official engagement photograph by Lord Snowdon (sold by Kerry Taylor Auctions for £26,400). This was followed by the headline-grabbing black taffeta gown she wore for her first public engagement with Prince Charles after the announcement of their engagement at Goldsmith's Hall in 1981 (now affectionately known as the 'Take the Plunge' dress), sold for £192,000. Of course the most memorable and important Emanuel dress of them all was the Royal bridal gown for her marriage to Prince Charles in 1981. Premiere: She was also photographed in the gown when she attended the premiere of the James Bond film 'The Living Daylights' on June 29, 1987 . The Emanuels went on to make special ensembles and evening gowns for Diana's important overseas State tours with the Prince of Wales, as well as producing a wardrobe of maternity wear during her pregnancies. The duplicate bridal gown commissioned from the Emanuels at the time of the Royal Wedding was sold by the auction house for £48,000. Kerry Taylor Auctions are famed for selling . historically important Royal garments ranging from King Charles I . nightshirt, Kate Middleton’s see-through fashion show dress to Princess . Diana’s couture velvet ‘Travolta’ gown, which she wore to dance at the . White House. Another . intriguing royal memento going under the hammer is a tiny pair of bellows used for powdering . the wig of (the famously oft-times mad) King George III. Made from . mahogany with an ivory tip, it is painted in gold with his Royal Cypher – . a kingly crown with ‘GR III’ - and estimated to fetch between £1000-1500. It is just 16cm (6 1/4in long) and would . have been used by his valet to administer the fashionable tinted powder . to the wig before it was placed on the Royal head. Another intriguing royal memento going under the hammer is a tiny pair of bellows used for powdering the wig of (the famously oft-times mad) King George III . Powdered . hair wigs were all the rage for most of the 18th century – the practice . falling from favour when the powder became heavily taxed in the 1790s. Wig powder was made from finely ground starch often scented with orange . blossom or lavender and came in pastel violet, blue and pink shades, but . the most popular colour was off-white. 'It seems strange to us in an age . when youth is seen as the most desirable aesthetic ideal – that people . seemed intent on making themselves appear much older,' said a spokesperson for Kerry Taylor auctions. King . George’s penchant for elaborate towering wigs in his youth resulted in . him being lampooned by the artist William Hogarth who poked fun at the . wigs worn at his Coronation in 1761 – with the  engraving ‘Five Orders . of Periwigs’.

Viewing: Sunday 1st December 12-4pm, Monday 2nd December 9-5.30pm, Tuesday 3rd December 9-11am. www.kerrytaylorauctions.com. 00 44 (0)208 676 4600 .","Ball gown is from Emanuel's 1986 'Diaghilev' collectione .
