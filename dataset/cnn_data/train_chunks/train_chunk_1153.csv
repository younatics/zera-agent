"The daughter of one of America's most notorious serial killers is attacking Stephen King for using her father as the inspiration for his new film. Kerri Rawson, the daughter of Wichita, Kansas, BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill) serial killer Dennis Rader, has said King is 'exploiting' the people her father killed, and her own family ,with his new film, A Good Marriage. The movie, which is set to hit theaters October 3, is about a woman who is unaware her husband is a serial killer. Scroll down for video . Devastated daughter: Kerri Rawson (left) has attacked author Stephen King for saying her father, Dennis Rader (right), the notorious BTK killer, inspired his new film . Attacked: King (above)has yet to comment on Rawson's interview . Inspiration: Joan Allen and Anthony LaPaglia (above) in a scene from the new Stephen King film, A Good Marriage . It is based on a short story the author wrote in 2010, which he then adapted for the screen. Coming soon: The film is set to hit theaters next Friday, and Rawson is hoping that King will donate the money he makes to 'abused children, battered wives, or police' While promoting the film, King has said on programs like The View that he was inspired by the BTK killer when he came up with the idea for the story, about a man whose own family was unaware of the horrible atrocities he had committed. Rawson, 36, and her family were also unaware her father was a killer. 'He’s exploiting my father’s 10 victims and their families,' Rawson told the The Kansas City Star. She then said of her father, 'He is not worth all the books and the news stories and all the attention.' Rader was arrested in 2005 and charged with 10 murders which occurred between 1974 and 1991. He received the nickname the BTK killer for the way in which he would bind and torture his victims before eventually killing them. He was caught after he sent a floppy disc to police, which they were able to trace back to him. He is currently serving 10 consecutive life sentences. 'He’s just going to give my father a big head, and he absolutely does not need that,' Rawson added. 'Great – now Stephen King is giving my father a big head. Thanks for that. That’s the last thing my dad should get.' She does think there is one way however King could do the right thing after the film, which stars Joan Allen and Anthony LaPaglia, opens next week. 'Any money King makes off this story should go either to abused children, battered wives, or police.' In the meantime, she said she is never reading one of King's novels again.","Kerri Rawson, the daughter of the notorious BTK killer, is attacking Stephen King for saying her father inspired his new film .

"Book of revelations: The Rev Richard Coles is telling all about his wild life before finding God in 1990 . Each weekend, the Reverend Richard Coles takes his two million Radio 4 listeners for a gentle stroll along the highways and byways of British life. As presenter of the family chat show Saturday Live, his wit and whimsy has been likened to ‘the aural equivalent of Ovaltine’; Coles is often described as Britain’s most famous vicar — aside from the fictional central character of the BBC hit comedy Rev, also based on him. He also has a ‘day job’. Twenty-four hours after broadcasting to the nation, the plump, bespectacled clergyman returns to the tranquillity of his role as Vicar of Finedon in Northamptonshire. His 14th-century parish church of St Mary the Virgin has a fine ring of bells and an organ which is said to have been played by George Handel. Nothing seismic has occurred in this backwater in the heart of England since the collapse of a landmark folly more than 60 years ago. But that is likely to change this week with the publication of the Rev Coles’s autobiography, Fathomless Riches. His 150 or so parishioners have been warned by him to ‘brace themselves’, for the contents are as far removed from the memoirs of a traditional vicar as can be imagined. ‘I hadn’t realised quite how eventful my life had been until I sat down to write about it,’ he said this week. ‘The truth is, country parsons often have a more vivid past than you might think.’ But surely none is quite so colourful as his. There is the gay promiscuity and ‘dogging’ with men in a local layby, week-long hard drugs binges, a lost year in Ibiza on Ecstasy and amphetamine, rave clubs, a suicide attempt, the deaths from Aids of so many friends, and his bizarre pretence over a number of years that he, too, was HIV positive, because he thought it made him seem more ‘glamorous’ on the gay scene. One can almost hear the smashing of dropped tea cups across Finedon. And if all that doesn’t leave his flock agog, when he next takes evensong they might find themselves reflecting on the episode when he woke up in a warehouse with a tyre mark across his bare torso, without a clue as to how it had got there. In his previous life he had been the instrumentalist half of the Eighties pop duo The Communards, who had a Number One single Don’t Leave Me This Way, and a number of other hits which made him millions. Scroll down for video . Past: Coles, right, as a member of The Communards alongside lead singer Jimmy Somerville . Art imitates life: The BBC hit comedy Rev, starring Tom Hollander (pictured), is based on the village vicar . If some of his parishioners feel they have already been given too much information about their vicar’s sexual past — Coles has been on a round of media interviews — much of what he admits in his book is deliberately unflattering to the point of self-flagellation. He grew up in Northamptonshire and his parents, who were shoe manufacturers, sent him to a minor public school where he was a chorister and, to his horror, realised he was gay. In his late teens he took a drug overdose, partly because in the Seventies being homosexual ‘was like being a paedophile now — it was a life which seemed to offer only disgrace’. Coles moved to London where he met Jimmy Somerville, the Scot who became his singing partner in The Communards. Success came fast and they had the UK’s biggest-selling single of 1986. But Coles was not entirely at ease with this sudden fame. He felt he was the gawky, bespectacled, musically trained geek who physically towered over the extrovert Somerville, but was otherwise lost in his friend’s shadow. Friction grew, and it was against this backdrop of drug-fuelled rowing that Coles invented the deception which eventually drove him towards God. The book details his pain as Aids swept away so many friends in the Eighties; he ascribes his survival to his unattractive physical appearance and crippling shyness, which stopped him taking part in the deadly promiscuity. Day job: The vicar's work at St Mary the Virgin in Finedon, Northamptonshire, is a million miles from his old life . During a European tour, Coles fell ill with shingles, one of the tell-tale signs of the HIV condition which leads to Aids. He had a blood test, but before he got the results had an argument with Somerville. It ended when Coles blurted what he thought to be true at the time: ‘Look, I’m HIV positive.’ In fact the blood test came back negative. But by then Coles admits he had come to like the horrible fiction he had created. In one interview this week he said: ‘Saying it got me sympathy, which I liked.’ But he told another interviewer: ‘The harder part to admit was that there was a dark glamour to being HIV positive, there was this drama and I was drawn to that.’ The lie carried on for an astonishing five years, during which time he says he was ‘too ashamed. I felt like such an idiot’. Memoir: The Rev Coles' book about his past . It was only after he had found God in 1990 that he mustered the courage to tell people he had been an HIV fraud. His Damascene moment came in a Mass at a central London church: ‘I was pierced to the soul at that moment . . . a shutter was flung open, and light flooded in and I could see.’ But telling those close to him about his big lie inevitably had unpleasant consequences: his oldest friend never spoke to him again. ‘It was so humiliating,’ Coles says. ‘But maybe that wasn’t such a bad thing; to be knocked off your pedestal is salutary . . . Now it means I am deeply concerned with being as honest as possible.’ He said the HIV/Aids crisis and his own lie about it played a part in his conversion to Christianity. He saw the ‘devoted, patient care’ of Aids patients by Christians. But he also recognised his own failings: ‘Shame was one of the drivers that brought me to God, because I needed to be forgiven [for] selfishness, silliness, wildness, taking s***loads of drugs, being irresponsible. And lying about being HIV positive.’ Inspired by his new-found faith, Coles took a theology degree at King’s College, London, before returning to his home county where he began to seriously consider taking holy orders. Around this time occurred the events which, as recounted in his autobiography, will perhaps jar most with the traditional wing of his church and some of his parishioners. Having eschewed much of the available gay sex as a conflicted pop star in the Eighties, Coles threw himself into a succession of casual public sexual encounters — now known as ‘dogging’ — as a born-again Christian in the late Nineties. He explained to one interviewer who met him at his home in Finedon: ‘In the love of Jesus Christ I discovered I was not so loathsome nor so special as I thought I was.’ In fact he had also discovered a layby on a busy road with a wood on either side. ‘This place where men could meet other men and have sex. I can’t say where it is because it’s not far from here.’ Club scene: The vicar had a lost year in Ibiza's dance clubs (pictured) on Ecstasy and amphetamine . The location offered, he says, ‘the perfect infrastructure for late-night debauchery’. What occurred there was ‘one of the great liberations of my life. Having lots of casual and anonymous sex with strangers.’ In another interview he explained further: ‘I was very much healed by the experience of anonymous sex with strangers in lay-bys. There were moments of profound intimacy with people who were dying to be intimate. Dying for it — just being close and being able to be vulnerable and express longing.’ He has admitted this wasn’t consistent with his growing Christian calling, but he wouldn’t repudiate having behaved the way he did then, saying simply: ‘I had a fantastic time.’ In 2005, he was ordained into the Anglican priesthood, and now lives a celibate life, albeit in civil partnership with David Oldham, a 37-year-old curate in a neighbouring parish. They met when Oldham went to hear Coles preach in Norwich seven years ago. Church of England rules dictating the celibacy of ministers in civil partnership coincided with their own sex life ‘fading away’. They sleep side by side and kiss, but only chastely. Coles says there is ‘nothing creditable in the Church of England’s position on gay relationships . . . the Church should repent of its hostility to homosexual people and beg forgiveness for its treatment of the gay community’. In the meantime, he might have to rely upon the tolerance, if not forgiveness, of his bishop. Coles is ready to be unrepentant: ‘Sex in lay-bys and telling a lie about being HIV might be too fruity for the Church of England,’ he has said. ‘But I’m not going to apologise for telling the truth.’ One awaits with interest the views of Finedon Mother’s Union.","A former pop star, the Rev Richard Coles hosts chat show Saturday Live .

"Christina Huffington, the daughter of media mogul Arianna Huffington, has posted pictures of herself happily kissing her new girlfriend. The 24-year-old writer - who has been open about a battle with cocaine that nearly killed her -  is believed to be seeing film producer Sophie Watts and has put up a series of pictures of the blonde on her Instagram account. A source told MailOnline: 'Christina and Sophie have been dating for a while, they're very happy.' Happy: Christina Huffington, daughter of Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington, is said to be in a happy and blossoming relationship with Sophie Watts . Smiles: Christina Huffington, seen here with Sophie Watts, has spoken openly about her battle with cocaine addiction and praised her family for their support . Happy family: Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington with her daughters Christina, on her left, and Isabella, on her right . Christina beams in the pictures - which include a picture of Sophie and her dog, to which she remarks 'My faves'. While in another photo, Sophie is seen at breakfast with Christina in Los Angeles, showing off a newspaper advert for Ariana's new book Thrive. Sophie is thought to be the daughter of Tessa Watts, a renowned English music video producer, who has worked with stars ranging from Michael Jackson to Madonna and Paul McCartney and Beyonce. Tessa is best known as one of the original members of Virgin Records and has been credited with coming up with the name for the company, founded by Sir Richard Branson, as all the staff were 'virgins' to business. She is divorced from rock journalist Michael Watts. Sophie attended Cambridge University and is now a film producer in her own right. Christina's father is former Republican congressman Michael Huffington, who came out as bisexual following his divorce from Arianna Huffington in 1998. She has been open about her lengthy battle with cocaine addiction that started when she was just 16. She first made the admission in a harrowing essay on her mother's website Huffington Post last April. She revealed how she had suffered bulimia as a teenager, scarred by her parents divorce, saying things came to a halt in 2012, writing: 'On March 4th, 2012, I was having trouble breathing. 'Am I going to be okay?' I asked the nurse who was monitoring my heart rate. 'I don't know,' she said. 'If you are, I hope you stop destroying your life'.' Proud: Christina Huffington posted a picture of Sophie Watts showing an advert promoting her mother Arianna Huffington's new book, Thrive . 'Fave Girls': Christina Huffington posted a picture on her instagram account of Sophie Watts and her dog with that message . She then penned a piece for Glamour magazine and went on the Today show, telling host Savannah Guthrie that despite all appearances, she was snorting lines of cocaine alone 'six or seven times' a day while at Yale University. She said It was 'absolutely un-glamorous. It was very much me by myself, in my apartment using drugs all day, from morning to night. There was nothing fun about it. I wasn’t at fun parties. I was really depressed, I was scared, I was anxious. I sort of felt isolated and alone and I thought I would never get out of there.' Christina, who is friends with troubled star Lindsay Lohan, who has also battled with drink and drugs, said she was opening up about her struggle in order to show people that drug addiction can hit anyone regardless of their social and economic background. 'II have been really blessed, and that’s part of the reason I struggled coming forward. What I want to show is that addiction can strike, no matter what. You can come from a loving family. You can have financial resources and you can still feel that pit of loneliness and emptiness and that desire to fill it with substances, so I just wanted to give a different face to the disease.' At one point, Christina said her mother was so worried she would drive her to the doctor for random drug testing, telling her 'I'm scared of what a good liar you are'. First trying the drug as a teen at boarding school, Christina told how she and her friends would spend $50 on a gram, meeting the drug dealer at the mall in Los Angeles and then getting their house keepers to pick them up, adding: 'We didn’t even have our licenses, but there we were, doing coke at each other’s houses.' Arianna said: ''Millions of young people in their teens and 20s struggle with alcohol and drug addiction. 'If Christina’s story can prevent one parent watching now from getting the call that I got, 'Mommy, I can't breathe,' and help one young or young man come out, reach out for help and know you can turn your life around, then it will have been worth it.'

Both Christina and Lindsay have battled drug issues . Christina has now been sober since March 4, . 2012, 'a day I’ll never forget.

She recalled asking . the nurse just before she was sedated whether she would be okay. 'I don’t know,' the nurse told her. 'But I hope, if you are, you’ll stop destroying your life.' Christina, who headed back to Yale to finish her degree, now lives in New York City with her . mother and her younger sister, Isabella, who told her 'you owe it to us . to get better' after putting them through so much.

"Wrestling legend 'Paul Bearer', real name William Alvin Moody, died of a heart attack caused by an untreated rapid heart rate, according to his son. Michael Moody told TMZ on Saturday that his father’s death certificate lists the cause of the heart attack as supraventricular tachycardia, or SVT -- an extremely rapid heart rhythm that occurs at the part of the heart's control system which keeps the top of the organ properly functioning. Mr Moody, the pasty-faced, urn-carrying manager for performers The Undertaker and Kane, died on Tuesday, March 5. He was 58. Scroll down for video . Heart attack victim: William Moody, aka Paul Bearer, the pasty-faced, urn-carrying manager for performers The Undertaker and Kane died of heart attack caused by an untreated rapid heart rate, his son said . SVT is typically not life threatening, though it can decrease one’s heart functionality if prolonged without treatment, according to medical sources. SVT's symptoms are similar to anxiety and heartburn, so it is not uncommon for people to wait out the discomfort instead of seeing a doctor. Those who get treated for the fairly common heart condition without waiting too long more often than not survive, one cardiologist told TMZ. Michael Moody said doctors believe his dad had been struggling with SVT for several weeks. Three days before Mr Moody died, he had reportedly complained to friends and family that he was suffering a blood clot. Prolonged heart condition: Moody's son said doctors believe the wrestling legend had been suffering from an untreated heart condition for several weeks . The WWE released a statement at the time of his death saying, ‘WWE is saddened to learn of the passing of William Moody, aka Paul Bearer.’ ‘Moody made his WWE debut in 1991 as the manager of The Undertaker and went on to become a memorable part of WWE over the course of the next 20 years. Our deepest condolences go out to Moody’s family, friends and fans.’ After stints in various independent wrestling promotions, Mr Moody joined the WWE in 1990 and quickly became associated with The Undertaker, a character who claimed he was undead and boasted of mystical powers. The WWE said in a statement that Mr Moody, 'went on to become a memorable part of WWE over the course of the next 20 years.'

In his final WWE appearance last year, Paul Bearer was locked in a freezer by Randy Orton and left there tied up even after he was found by Kane. That was Mr Moody's life in the WWE. And it was a business he loved for nearly 40 years. Many of his colleagues paid tribute to him on Twitter following the news of his death. 'Rest in peace, Paul Bearer. You will never be forgotten. There will never be another,' wrote wrestler Triple H. On March 2, Mr Moody allegedly told people at a Cauliflower Alley Club reunion that he was seeking treatment for 'respiratory issues.' The president of the wrestling society, Bob Kelly, told TMZ that the wrestling manager was hospitalized immediately after the reunion. Mr Moody was a perfect fit as a macabre mortician. When he joined the WWE, he ditched the blond hair and Percy Pringle name he forged in the 1980s for jet black locks complete with powdered white face.

'It was one those had-to-be-there moments when Vince realized I was the real thing, the real deal,' Mr Moody told the website. 'I was the real Undertaker.' Mr Moody battled health and weight problems and worked on and off for the company after 2002. Foley said he babysat Mr Moody's children and called him 'Uncle Paul.' The Paul Bearer character will be remembered most for the soap opera twists in his relationship with The Undertaker, still one of the premier stars of the WWE.

"Boko Haram, the extremist Islamic group in Nigeria, has released a video that shows the beheading of a man who identifies himself the pilot of a missing Nigerian Air Force jet. The video that emerged yesterday also allegedly features Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau - a terrorist who Nigeria's military claimed to have killed. Officials announced last week that Shekau was dead and that a man who had been posing as the group's leader in the videos had been killed after fighting with troops in the far northeast. Scroll down for video . Leader: The video also allegedly features Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau - a terrorist who Nigeria's military claimed to have killed. He claims that the group are implementing Shariah law in parts of Nigeria . But the new 36-minute video appears to show Shekau, in combat fatigues and black rubber boots, standing on the back of a pick-up truck and firing an anti-aircraft gun into the air. Standing in front of three camouflaged vans and flanked by four heavily armed, masked fighters, he then speaks for 16 minutes in Arabic and the Hausa language widely spoken in northern Nigeria. There was no indication of where or when the video was shot. Shekau appears in separate images from the violence. The heavily bearded Shekau, who appeared to be the same man as those in previous clips released by the group, said the military's claim that he was dead was propaganda. Speaking to the camera, the man says: 'Here I am, alive, and I will remain alive until the day Allah takes away my breath. Claims: Shekau, in combat fatigues and black rubber boots, standing on the back of a pick-up truck and firing an anti-aircraft gun into the air. He says that the military's claim that he was dead was propaganda . 'Even if you kill me... it will not stop us imposing Islamic rule ... We are still in our Islamic state, reigning and teaching the Quran.' There have been two previous claims by Nigeria that Shekau had been killed or 'may be dead' but Boko Haram later issued video denials. Security analysts and the United States have also questioned the credibility of the Nigerian military's claim. Footage shows charred plane wreckage that appear to have Nigerian military markings, bolstering the group's claims that it shot down a fighter plane. In the video, a man is seen kneeling in a camouflage vest with his right hand in a sling, with a fighter hovering over him with an axe, which is later used in his beheading. Speaking in English, the victim identifies himself as a wing commander in the Nigerian Air Force and says he was undertaking a mission in Kauri area of northeast Borno state. He says: 'We were shot down and our aircraft crashed. To this day I don't know the whereabouts of my second pilot.' Two pilots and an Alpha jet have been missing since mid-September when it left the northeastern town of Yola on a bombing mission against Boko Haram. In the footage, Boko Haram fighters are seen apparently picking through the wreckage of the downed Alpha aircraft and the military's green and white logo is clearly visible. But air force spokesman Air Commodore Dele Alonge said: 'For any group to claim they shot it down is mere propaganda and rubbish.' Military top brass suggested images of the plane could have been manipulated but said they were studying the claims in the video, even though they had not seen it. In a statement on its website, Nigeria's Defence Headquarters said the video did not indicate when it was shot with a screen time or date or provide any proof that Shekau was alive. 'As far as we are concerned, the individual who was appearing in video and claiming to be the leader of the terrorist group was killed in the Kondunga battle in September. Wreckage: In the footage, Boko Haram fighters are seen apparently picking through the wreckage of the downed Alpha aircraft and the military's green and white logo is clearly visible. 'The resemblance of the corpse and that of the eccentric character was incontrovertible. His identity was equally corroborated by people who knew him before we announced his death.' The video contains images of extreme violence, including graphic scenes of an amputation, a stoning to death and lashings. Elsewhere in the new video, the militant leader said the group had implemented strict Islamic law in the towns that it had captured in the northeast in recent weeks. He says: 'We are running our caliphate, our Islamic caliphate. We follow the Koran...in the land of Allah.' Brutal: The video shows footage of a man being stoned to death for adultery, another having his right hand cut off at the wrist for theft. Above, Shekau speaks in the new 36-minute video released yesterday . The video shows footage of a man being stoned to death for adultery, another having his right hand cut off at the wrist for theft and a man and a woman receiving 100 lashes for sex out of wedlock. Crowds of men, women and children are seen watching the punishments. The scenes of graphic violence are not unprecedented but come as other groups in the wider jihadi network, particularly Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, have issued similar footage. In a Boko Haram video obtained on August 24, footage showed the apparent execution of about 20 men captured in town of Gwoza in Borno and two others beaten to death with rocks and pick-axes. Doubts: In a statement on its website, Nigeria's Defence Headquarters said the video did not indicate when it was shot with a screen time or date or provide any proof that Shekau was alive . Richard Downie, deputy director of the Africa Programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Boko Haram has likely adapted its videos to model the IS group, which has captured global attention by broadcasting grotesque violence. Extremist groups 'learn from each other, certainly in terms of communication', said Downie, describing Shekau as a 'savvy media character'. But, he added, the influence of the IS organisation on Boko Haram is likely minimal, describing the group as still focused on Nigeria with limited interest in Arab jihadis. 'I'd be wary of the notion that the Middle East drives everything,' Downie said.","Two pilots and a fighter jet have been missing since 11 September .

"It is said of Alexander the Great that 'when he saw the breadth of his domain, he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer.' Lionel Messi might be starting to feel the same way about breaking records. This week, the Barcelona superstar has become the all-time leading goalscorer in both La Liga and the Champions League, adding to his mammoth collection of personal bests. But, as our map of all his goals in Europe's leading competition shows, there are plenty of lands still to conquer for the Argentinian wizard. His hat-trick in Nicosia, Cyprus, on Tuesday night took him past Real Madrid legend Raul as the leading scorer in the Champions League with 74. It was also the 23rd European city and 16th European country in which Messi has hit the target in the continent's premier competition. Our map of Lionel Messi's 74 Champions League goals shows the cities in which he has scored (and the number in each). The badge shows the opponent, with the exception of his home ground in Barcelona. Messi scored in Champions League finals against Manchester United in both Rome in 2009 and London in 2011. Scroll down for the full list of his goals. Messi's hat-trick in Barcelona's 4-0 win over APOEL Nicosia on Tuesday saw him break Raul's Champions League scoring record . Messi clips home his second of the evening and Barcelona's third as they ran out comfortable winner against the Cypriot team . Messi now has 74 goals in the Champions League and has scored in 23 different cities and 16 European countries in the competition . 1st: Lionel Messi (Barcelona) - 74 goals . 2nd: Raul (Real Madrid, Schalke) - 71 . 3rd: Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Real Madrid) - 70 . 4th: Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United, Real Madrid) - 56 . 5th: Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) - 50 . Barcelona will always be his home from home, of course, and 38 of his strikes in the Champions League have come in front of an adoring Nou Camp. But Barca's - frequently successful - campaigns the length and breadth of Europe have seen Messi plunder goals in many leading cities. He has scored three times against Celtic in Glasgow, Viktoria Plzen in Prague and Shakhtar in Donetsk. He added the Cypriot city of Nicosia to that list on Tuesday as Barcelona ran out 4-0 victors. Messi has netted twice against Real in Madrid, PSG in Paris, Ajax in Amsterdam, AC Milan in the San Siro, BATE Borisov in Minsk and Spartak in Moscow. And, proving that he can score just about anywhere, he's also been on target in Lisbon, London (against Manchester United in the 2011 final), Manchester, Lyon, Leverkusen, Stuttgart, Bremen, Basle, Rome (against United in the 2009 final), Copenhagen, Kiev and Athens. Messi broke the Champions League goalscoring record of Raul, who netted 71 in the competition for Real Madrid andSchalke . Messi beats Manchester City's Joleon Lescott and Joe Hart to score in last season's round of 16 tie - 38 of his goals came at the Nou Camp . Joe Hart is again left cursing after Messi scores past him at the Etihad Stadium last season as Manchester City were beaten 2-0 .

Messi has won the European Cup on three occasions - in 2006, 2009 and 2011 (pictured) when Manchester United were beaten at Wembley . Messi powers home in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Manchester United in the 2011 final at Wembley Stadium, his only goal so far in London . With Messi breaking records seemingly at will right now, he perhaps can tick off a few more countries with a favourable draw in the seasons to come. Poland, Turkey, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Romania and Bulgaria are among the nations in which Messi has not yet scored. And, to adapt a popular barb aimed at him, he's not done it on a cold night in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As well as beating Raul's overall record - and keeping him ahead of rival Cristiano Ronaldo (70 goals) - Messi also wrote a few more lines in the record books. It was his fifth hat-trick in the competition - a record - and he also has the most two-goal hauls with 20. He has also scored in 24 different stadiums in the Champions League - more than anyone else. Messi was also the scourge of Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League final in Rome, where he scored Barcelona's second goal . Messi gets to the ball ahead of Sergio Ramos to score for Barcelona against bitter rivals Real Madrid in the 2011 semi-final, first leg . Messi has scored on three occasions at Celtic Park, Glasgow, including this one back in February 2008 . Messi is also the first player in the history of the European Cup and the Champions League to score five or more goals in eight consecutive seasons. It continues a pretty good week for the 27-year-old, who broke Telmo Zarra's long-standing La Liga scoring record of 251 in Barcelona's 5-1 win over Sevilla at the weekend. He may usurp Zarra again soon - Messi has 28 hat-tricks in competitive games for Barcelona, while Zarra has 31, the record for Spanish clubs. Messi is also one behind Raul's record of 76 goals in all the European competitions, including the Super Cup. So unlike the teary Alexander the Great, Messi still has plenty still to accomplish. Few doubt that he will do it. MESSI: EVERY CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GOAL . List courtesy of Opta .

"More terrorists could be kicked out of the country if it was not for the Lib Dems, David Cameron suggested this morning. The Prime Minister said the Government needed to 'restore' Britain's ability to deport extremists, but said it was crucial to overhaul the European Convention of Human Rights to do this. Nick Clegg has blocked any move to curtail the power of the Strasbourg court. Mr Cameron also revealed he was a 'Thatcherite', attacked Mr Clegg's claim it was unpatriotic to be eurosceptic and suggested Ukip's support would collapse by the time of the next election. Scroll down for videos . Hate cleric Abu Hamza was deported from Britain in 2012 and is now facing the rest of his life behind bars in the US . David Cameron insisted the UK had a good record tackling extremism after the US convicted Abu Hamza on 11 counts of terrorism. The Islamist spent 10 years in Britain avoiding being kicked out . Mr Cameron's remarks came after he was criticised for relying on the US to convict hate preacher Abu Hamza of 11 terror offences. The hook-handed Islamist clreic spent 10 years in Britain attacking the West - before finally being deported to American in 2012. The PM said 'justice has been done' but insisted Britain should not 'talk ourselves down' over the failure to convict him in the UK. But he admitted there were too many legal hurdles in the way of kicking out terrorrists - and suggested he was being blocked in his bid to cut these back by Nick Clegg. Hardline Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has vowed to curtail the European Convention of Human Rights. He wants the final decision to rest with the British Supreme Court in London and not in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . He said: 'We need to look at the avenues of appeal that there are and make sure that those are gone through more quickly – and we have made changes there. 'Obviously we also need to look, as I’ve said many times, at the European Convention on Human Rights and the position we have got to get into where if someone threatens our country we should be able to deport them if they have no right to be here and that is absolutely essential, that we restore that. 'We’ve taken some big steps, but I plan to take more steps if I’m elected as a Conservative Prime Minister after the next election.' In a wide-ranging interview on Radio 4 this morning, ahead of Thursday's European elections, the Prime Minister also claimed he was a 'Thatcherite' and predicted that Ukip supporters would flock back to him in time for the general election. The Tory leader said he was as committed to people buying their own home as Margaret Thatcher. Asked if he was a Thatcherite in this regard, Mr Cameron said: 'Absolutely. I think it wasn’t just Margaret Thatcher. Since the Second World War, Conservative leaders have always believed in a property-owning democracy' David Cameron said the desire to buy your own property was 'natural' and he wanted to help more people get their first home . The PM claimed Labour had tried to extinguish Mrs Thatcher's right to buy - and he wanted to get it going again. He said: 'I think the introduction of the Right to Buy and those discounts Margaret Thatcher introduced were incredibly important in our country and I’ve tried to relight the Right to Buy fire, as it were. 'I want to see more people buy and own their homes. It is a very natural instinct. I think all of us – I can remember the moment I walked through the door of the first flat that I bought and the pride that you feel and you sense that it’s your own and you can develop and improve it. 'It’s a deep, natural human instinct and I fully support it.' He claimed that he was putting 'rocket boosters' under Mrs Thatcher's 'Right to Buy' your council house scheme. The PM added: 'Now, it’s been very challenging in recent years because we had the appalling boom and bust and crash and the banks have been taking time to recover so it’s been difficult for people to get the loans they need, but all of this, like the rest of the economy, is mending and people are now able to get those loans.' Mr Cameron also appeared to accept that Ukip would siphon off Tory supporters in this week's election. But he insisted they would come back into the Conservative fold in time for the general election - because they would realise that only he could give them an in-out referendum on Europe. He said: 'In many ways of course the referendum pledge will have its greatest relevance at the time of the next election when people will be choosing: ""Do you want to have the Conservatives, David Cameron, continue in office with a long-term economic plan that’s turning the country around and an in/out referendum?"" 'Do you want those things or do you want Labour that will tax, spend and borrow? 'Or do you want to vote for another party that could risk not having a long-term economic plan and the referendum?' Nigel Farage is expected to win this week's European elections - but the Prime Minister this morning claimed many Ukip supporters would vote for the Tories in the next general election because of his promise to hold an in-out referendum in 2017 . Mr Cameron also hit back at Nick Clegg’s claims that euroscepticism was 'unpatriotic'. 'You can be deeply patriotic and love your country and believe that its place belongs inside the European Union or you can be deeply patriotic, love your country and believe it belongs outside the European Union,' Mr Cameron said. He added: 'Your patriotism is not defined by your position on this question; your patriotism is defined by your love of your country, its institutions, its history, what it can do in the world.'","Prime Minister says he will overhaul European Convention on Human Rights .

"Russell Crowe watched his South Sydney team come away with the gong after demolishing Super League champions St Helens in an embarrassingly one-sided 2015 World Club Challenge. Crowe's decision to put rugby league before the Oscars paid off as he watched his beloved Rabbitohs follow up their 2014 NRL title triumph and their recent success in the NRL Nines to claim a first world crown with a 39-0 rout of Saints. Putting Langtree Park ahead of the red carpet in Hollywood, Crowe arrived by helicopter at nearby Haydock Park racecourse to join the sell-out crowd of 17,980 and witness a further demonstration of the gulf that remains between the NRL and Super League.

Bath's union convert Sam Burgess, hero of their Grand-Final success, sat next to the Hollywood actor and director to cheer on his twin brothers George and Sam as the Rabbitohs became the sixth NRL winners of the World Club Challenge in the last seven years. Their seven-try triumph also completed a 3-0 whitewash of the cream of Super League following earlier wins by St George Illawarra and Brisbane Broncos over Warrington and Wigan respectively. Whereas Wigan and Warrington at least pushed their opponents all the way, Saints were given a rude awakening as Souths demonstrated their class from the start. Keiron Cunningham's men trailed 24-0 at half-time and the final score meant a third crushing defeat for Saints, who went down 44-6 to Melbourne in 2000 and 38-0 to Sydney Roosters in 2003. Just like Warrington and Wigan before them, Saints conceded early, with former Manly forward Glenn Stewart marking his debut with a second-minute try, touching down a grubber kick from the excellent Adam Reynolds, who went on to kick five goals from seven attempts. Luke Keary is mobbed by his team-mates as the Rabbitohs back crosses for his side's fifth try . Saints tried to rally but were met by a stone wall as the Rabbitohs demonstrated the smothering defence that is so typical of the NRL, whose teams appear determined to prove that every lost cause is one worth retrieving. Souths illustrated their scrambling defence early on to prevent Saints centre Mark Percival scoring what looked a certain try while prop Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook was also turned on his back over the line. The visitors, conversely, were clinical in their execution. Centre Dylan Walker turned the Saints defence inside out to finish off a break by Reynolds and full-back Greg Inglis showed his class in taking a return pass from Bryson Goodwin to score a third try.

George Burgess carries powerfully into the St Helens defence as the NRL champions dominate proceedings . Crowe speaks to the media prior to this side's 2015 World Club Challenge clash against St Helens . Percival went close again without any joy and there was no way back for the Super League champions once winger Joel Reddy touched down John Sutton's speculative kick on the half-hour mark. It was damage limitation when stand-off Luke Keary went in for a fifth try six minutes into the second half and Souths simply picked off their opponents to add further tries through substitute Chris McQueen and Reddy while Reynolds wrapped up the scoring with a meaningless drop goal. St Helens never threw in the towel but the Australians had an answer for everything thrown at them as Crowe began the celebrations and Super League went back to the drawing board.","St Helens trailed 24-0 at half-time to the NRL champions .

"With its commanding position in the middle of a loch, this isle could be fit for royalty. And its regal demeanour is completed by its name - King’s Island, translated from the Gaelic Eilean Righ. Now you could own the charming piece of Scottish land off the Argyll coastline within Loch Craignish for the princely sum of £3million after a top City trader put it on the market. It has been owned since 1999 by former Goldman Sachs market trader, Christian Siva-Jothy, who once enjoyed almost mythical status among the City’s financial community. Stunning: King's Island, translated from the Gaelic Eilean Righ, sits around 300m off the Argyll coastline within Loch Craignish. Sea view: King's Island off the Scottish coast is on the market for £3million . That all came to an end last year, when he closed down the $200million business he began after leaving Goldman Sachs and made a stunning confession about his ability to play the market. Mr Siva-Jothy wrote to investors in his firm SemperMacro: 'In this business, you are only as good as your last few trades. 'Mine have not been very good.  Whether I have lost my edge or simply need a break after 23 years, I am not sure. I certainly hope it’s the latter.' Mr Siva-Jothy’s financial misfortune may explain his sale of King’s Island, being handled by the Edinburgh office of estate agents, Knight Frank. Certainly, prospective purchasers would need to be wealthy - with the island carrying a £3million price tag. Yet its description suggests it may also provide a remote hide-out for a wannabe James Bond. Getaway: The island boasts a totally refurbished four-bedroomed house, a helicopter hangar, boathouse, two slipways and jetty moorings . As well as a four-bedroomed principal . house, the 238-acre island comes complete with a giant 500sq metre . helicopter hangar, two slipways and a jetty. Mr Siva-Jothy is a qualified helicopter pilot and would often fly one of his three aircraft from the island to his work in London. He made his money as he watched the September 11 terrorist attacks unfold. He said: 'The first thing I noticed on TV was that it was a perfectly clear blue sky day. 'I’m a helicopter pilot and I’ve been flying for 14 years. I know that when you’ve got a plane that’s going down, you don’t aim for the tallest building to fly into.' He immediately bought eurodollars, capitalising on the plunge in consumer confidence and the collapse of many markets world-wide. King’s Island has had a number of colourful owners over the years.  In the 1930’s, it was home to Sir Reginald Johnston, the retired tutor to the last Chinese Emperor, Puyi. Sir Reginald built a Bhuddist temple on the island and flew the Manchukuoan flag in the Chinese-style gardens. It later passed into the hands of a retired Indian Army officer, Lord Wilfred Brown andJames Waldegrave, the Viscount Chewton.","King’s Island is about 300m off the Argyll coastline within Loch Craignish is on the market after a top City figure decided to sell .

"Tragic socialite Casey Johnson desperately tried to reconnect with her estranged billionaire father before her sudden death in 2010, but he refused to respond, her mother has revealed. Sale Johnson said that her ex-husband Woody Johnson, who owns the New York Jets, did not pick up Casey's calls or return her letters after cutting her out following a string of public embarrassments. Casey, who was heiress to the Johnson & Johnson fortune before her death from complications of diabetes aged 30, also struggled with borderline personality disorder, her mother has revealed. In the years leading up to her death, it manifested itself in a turbulent lifestyle of heavy partying. In decisions deemed rash by her family, she also adopted a baby and started a lesbian relationship. Sale Johnson and other relatives and friends spoke to author Jerry Oppenheimer for a new biography, Crazy Rich, that details the scandals of the Johnson & Johnson dynasty and lifts the lid on Casey Johnson's turbulent life and tragic demise. Tragic: Socialite and Johnson & Johnson heiress Casey Johnson, pictured in 2008, passed away in 2010 after years of struggling with borderline personality disorder and diabetes . The book has now been excerpted in the New York Post. 'Borderline personality disorder ruled . Casey’s life,' Oppenheimer quotes Sale Johnson, who revealed her daughter's mental . condition for the first time in the book. 'It stole her teenage years and her young . adulthood life away from her. It’s a mental health disease that . confounds, scares, hurts the victim, her family, her friends, and her . doctors. 'They don't want to treat it because it has the highest suicide . rate, and no cure, and [someone like Casey] is a 24/7 patient.' Happier times: Casey is pictured with her father, Jets owner Woody Johnson, before their estrangement . Support: Casey with her mother Sale, left, who now looks after Casey's daughter, Ava-Monroe, right . Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a mental illness characterized by unstable moods, behavior and relationships. Sufferers have problems regulating their emotions and are susceptible to intense anger, impulsive and reckless behavior and often have stormy relationships with loved ones. Among sufferers, there are high rates of depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, self harm and suicidal thoughts. While research is continuing into the causes and risk factors, scientists believe that genetic and environmental factors could be involved. Unstable family situations could also increase a person's risk. Around 1.6 per cent of adults in the U.S. have BPD, and symptoms usually begin to show in early adulthood. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medications that can help reduce anxiety or depression. It further complicated her diabetes, . which she had been diagnosed with aged eight, and which ultimately . claimed her life after she failed to properly take her insulin. Her . mother said that at first it was assumed that her disruptiveness at . home and school as a child was due to the diabetes, when in fact, it was . likely caused by her borderline personality disorder. And as she aged, the condition only took further hold, causing unstable moods and relationships. After . a charmed upbringing during which she was given anything she dreamed . of, she began partying, drinking and taking drugs in an attempt to help . her through her struggles, her mother said. She lasted just one semester at Brown . University and after her parents divorced in 2001, she moved to . Hollywood with dreams of becoming a star. Her parents moved to Los Angeles several years later to stage an intervention, but she rebuffed them, angering her father. 'After that, Woody basically washed his hands of Casey,' Sale Johnson said. Then, after a public falling out with Woody's sister Elizabeth Ross Johnson, he cut off all ties with her, including her trust fund of millions of dollars. Relationship: Casey was engaged to model and TV personality Tila Tequila at the time of her death . Party life: Casey Johnson is pictured left with fellow heiress Nicky Hilton in 2002, and right in 2008 . Troubled: Casey, in 2005, was known for her partying lifestyle, which was an embarrassment to her father . As she continued to struggle with her . health, Casey adopted a Kazakh baby girl, Ava-Monroe, in 2007, even . though her parents were concerned she could not look after the child. Revelations: The new details about the family have emerged in Crazy Rich, due out next month . A year later, her mother said Casey . was desperate to introduce Ava to her estranged father in an attempt to . reconnect and visited his home - where she was met by his second wife, . Suzanna Ircha. Ircha . demanded Casey leave and she refused, sparking a loud and heated . argument - and eventually Ircha called 911. Woody also arrived home and . demanded his daughter never return. Despite his hostility, Casey did not give up on a relationship with her father, Sale said. 'Casey . sent love letters to her father,' she said in the book. 'She called and . left voice mails, and Woody chose not to respond.' As Casey spiraled further out of control - being hospitalized for her diabetes, handing her daughter over to her mother and starting a public lesbian relationship with model Tila Tequila - Sale said she became bitter about how her ex-husband had just washed his hands of their troublesome daughter. 'He didn't want to have anything to do with Casey,' she said. 'It was too much trouble. But fathers are supposed to take a bullet for their kids, and he went the other way... I thought it was appalling.' After she became more distanced from her family towards the end of 2009, she is believed to have spent New Year's Eve alone in Los Angeles. Passing: Police officers leave Casey's Hollywood home, where she was found dead in January 2010 . Home: She died aged 30 after slipping into a diabetic coma after failing to properly regulate her insulin . Her body was discovered on January 4, 2010 - a few days after she is believed to have died after slipping into a diabetic coma. After his daughter's death, Woody . Johnson told the New York Times that she had been 'trying to find her . own identity. She was rebellious. She made some judgment errors. Been . there, done that. She had to take responsibility. And it couldn't be me . pushing. Or her mother. Or her doctor. She would ultimately have to do . it herself.' Tila Tequila, . who had become engaged to Johnson just weeks before her death, led the . tributes on Twitter, saying: 'R.I.P. my Angel, u will forever be in my . heart! I love u so so much and we will Marry when I see U in Heaven my . Wifey.'

"A man on trial for strangling to death a schoolteacher is arguing that his wife was really the mastermind of the murder. Allen Prue, 32, and his 35-year-old wife Patricia are being tried separately in the 2012 death of teacher and single mother Melissa Jenkins, 33. Jenkins' body was found dumped in Vermont's Connecticut River in March of that year, after being lured from her home to help the couple who called to say their car broke down. Allen's trial started this week, while his wife is due in court for her trial sometime next month. Scroll down for video . Not my fault: Allen Prue is currently on trial for murdering schoolteacher Melissa Jenkins in March 2012. His trial started yesterday in Vermont, and his defense attorneys plan to argue that his wife Patricia is the real person behind the crime. Allen pictured above in court on Wednesday . Jealous: Allen's defense attorneys claim Patricia Prue (pictured left in March 2012) grew jealous of Melissa Jenkins (right) after her husband asked the teacher out on a date. Jenkins rebuffed Allen's advances and told friends she felt uncomfortable around him . In opening statements on Wednesday, Allen's attorneys argued that the feeble-minded man with a 75 IQ had no idea his wife planned to murder the woman, who he once helped perform snow plow work for. After Jenkins' body was found, Allen confessed to police that he and his wife planned 'to get a girl they could play with' which led them to the teacher. But his attorneys are now saying Allen admitted to the crime just to protect his wife, who had become crazy after her husband asked Jenkins out on a date. Jenkins had turned down Allen's advances and told friends she felt uncomfortable around him. Orphaned: Jenkins' was reported missing when a friend found her car abandoned on the side of a road, with her 2-year-old son alone inside. The boy later told authorities: 'someone pulled on mommy's neck' 'In her crazy, twisted mind she had become obsessively jealous of Melissa Jenkins. The evidence will show that Patricia Prue strangled Melissa Jenkins without telling him she was going to do it, without planning it with him and without Allen Prue aware in any way shape or form,' his defense attorney Robert Katims said. Jenkins was reported missing in March 2012, after a friend found her car abandoned on the side of the road with her 2-year-old son alone in the back seat. The boy later told officers that 'someone pulled on mommy's neck'. Weak minded: Allen's attorneys say he has a 75 IQ and was easily manipulated by his wife in the murder. They claim he had no idea she had plans to actually kill Jenkins. Pictured above in court on Wednesday . Authorities say Patricia called Jenkins to come and help her and her husband, saying their car broke down. Jenkins agreed, but as soon as she showed up and got out of her vehicle, she was allegedly strangled and beaten to death. The couple then took Jenkins' body back to their home where they removed all of her clothes, poured bleach on the body and wrapped her in a tarp. They dumped the body in the Connecticut River, which separates Vermont from New Hampshire, weighing the body down with blocks, and burning the clothes and tarp.

"The most corrosive love-hate relationship between two brothers since Cain and Abel had nine million TV viewers on the edge. The rivalry between the Holmes boys reached new intensities last Sunday, as Sherlock drugged his older brother Mycroft to steal a laptop full of government secrets — and was ordered to go on a suicide mission as punishment. If the dynamic between the siblings took a more central role than ever, then that was no accident. For as Steven Moffat, who co-produces the show, says: ‘Mycroft is a very complex character. Somehow, he’s the key to Sherlock.’ Key player: Mark Gatiss and Benedict Cumberbatch play battling brothers Sherlock and Mycroft, a relationship inspired by Gatiss's own childhood . How true — and in more ways than one. For ‘Mycroft’ read ‘Mark Gatiss’, the 47-year-old actor who plays him. Here is the man who is key to understanding the whole Sherlock revival. For what many casual fans do not realise is that in addition to starring in the series, Gatiss is also its co-creator and chief scriptwriter. To have created, written and starred in the most succesful BBC drama series for years would be a remarkable enough, but that is by no means Gatiss’s only claim to fame. Indeed, last year saw him become one of the most successful actor-writers of his generation. In addition to Sherlock, he was heavily involved in the 50th anniversary celebrations for Doctor Who. Having written for the show ever since its revival under scriptwriter Russell T. Davies, Gatiss penned An Adventure In Space And Time — a drama about the Doctor’s early days at the BBC — as well as two new episodes of the latest series. He adapted and directed an M. R. James ghost story, which was a highlight of BBC2’s Christmas Day schedule, as well as writing and presenting a documentary about the author. Complex character: Mark Gatiss is not only playing Mycroft Holmes, he also created the show with Steven Moffat, produces it and writes the script . Steven Moffat, who co-produces the show, says: 'Mycroft is a very complex character. Somehow, he's the key to Sherlock' An episode of Poirot’s final series similarly came from his pen. Oh, and all the while he has been starring in a sell-out production of Shakespeare’s Corialanus at the Donmar Warehouse — the latest in a line of classical theatre roles. That he has also written three novels, based around the adventures of a detective called Lucifer Box, is almost surplus to requirements. Small wonder, then, that one broadsheet newspaper this week used one of its editorial leader columns to declare Gatiss ‘a national treasure’. Such popular acclaim might never have come his way had it not been for a passing comment made on a train journey from Cardiff to London in 2009, when Gatiss was travelling with Steven Moffat, his long-term collaborator on Doctor Who. Gatiss remarked on the coincidence that in 1881, when the first Sherlock Holmes story appeared, Dr John Watson was a war veteran who had been wounded in Afghanistan. Nearly 130 years later, the British Army was fighting in the same distant outpost: perhaps, he mused, a modern-day Watson was there. Inspiration struck both men. ‘It was a lightbulb moment,’ Gatiss says. What followed was the most critically lauded TV show in years, and one which saw the affectionate loathing between Sherlock and Mycroft develop to a new intensity. In one telling scene at the start of the latest series, Mycroft picked up a large white teapot and announced: ‘I’ll be mother.’ To which Holmes retorted: ‘And there is a whole childhood in a nutshell.’ Such psychologically laden lines have prompted some to suspect that Gatiss has commandeered one of literature’s best-loved heroes for some personal family therapy. For Gatiss’s own childhood was marked by a complex relationship with his parents and a bitter rivalry with his own older brother, all set against a truly gothic backdrop that was to inspire his lifelong fascination with the macabre. When Gatiss was born in Sedgefield, County Durham, in 1966, his brother Phillip was three years old. They grew up in the village of School Aycliffe, north of Darlington, where their father was a mining engineer. As the pits closed, his father joined his mother working at the psychiatric hospital opposite their home. Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat came up with the idea of Sherlock while on a train to London  after having worked on Doctor Who in Cardiff . The hospital, once known as Aycliffe Colony for the Mentally Defective, became Mark’s second home. He and Phillip used the swimming pool there, had their haircuts done by staff, and watched films in the hospital’s cramped cinema. One of Gatiss’s earliest memories is of seeing Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, surrounded by people whose illness had left deep marks on their faces. ‘I was almost as frightened of the people sitting around me as of the Child Catcher [the film’s villain],’ he recalls. ‘The faces and personalities were true northern Gothic.’ He acknowledges that it also explains his adult obsession with monsters, demons and derelict buildings: ‘It definitely left its mark. I’ve always liked the macabre. ‘I was always drawn to the supernatural, anything odd. I liked “stepping out of the sunshine”.’ To the young Gatiss, his father was a forbidding figure. ‘I realise now that was mainly because he worked so hard. He wasn’t unkind, but he was a presence. When our mum said, “Wait till your father gets home”, it definitely worked.’ But it was his relationship with his brother that left the most lasting scars. The boys detested each other and fought frequently. Though they would stick up for each other in playground scraps, at home, Phillip would punch and bully his little brother. ‘We only stopped hating each other recently,’ Gatiss says. ‘We never had anything in common. He was painfully shy and found his expression in lashing out at people.’ Gatiss, meanwhile, found another escape: the stage. During his first year of drama college, he met Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton and Jeremy Dyson. The four began writing and performing a ghoulish sketch show called The League Of Gentlemen. It developed into a radio sitcom about the inhabitants of a morbidly gruesome village on the remote Yorkshire Moors, a backwater called Royston Vasey. The motto on the village signposts promised ‘You’ll Never Leave’, and the population of serial killers, psychopaths, cannibals and lunatics made sure of that. After the show won the Perrier comedy award at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1997, it transferred to BBC2 TV. All the actors played multiple roles, often in drag. Gatiss’s best characters included Hilary Briss, the butcher who kept cuts of human flesh for special customers; Iris, the cleaner with a disgustingly lurid lovelife; and Val, the obedient housewife whose husband is obsessed with bodily functions. Such dark humour would hardly make Gatiss the natural choice to pen the revival of a children’s classic. But having been obsessed by Doctor Who as a child, he had supplemented his wages as an actor in the early 90s by writing four Doctor Who novels. Redbeard: The young Sherlock appearing in flashbacks, bullied by an adult Mycroft, was played by Gatiss's co-creator Steven Moffat's son . When the show was revived for TV by producers Russell T. Davies and Steven Moffat, Gatiss was the first writer they hired. His first episode featured Simon Callow as Charles Dickens, starting a pattern that has seen Gatiss cast actors that he admired in his youth as stars for his projects. The credits for his Christmas Day dramatisation of M.R. James’s spine-chilling story The Tractate Middoth read like a geek’s dream dinner party: there was Eleanor Bron, who starred with The Beatles in Help!; former Doctor Who assistant Louise Jameson; Una Stubbs from Til Death Us Do Part, and Roy Barraclough, the former Coronation Street actor who did a famous drag double act called Cissy and Ada with comedian Les Dawson. Murder and mystery have been a recurring theme: Midsomer Murders, Inspector George Gently, Poirot, Marple, Jekyll… Gatiss has been involved with them all, as writer or actor. His fascination with Victoriana and Dickensian horror spills over into real life. At the Islington house he shares with his civil partner, actor Ian Hallard, he constructed a mad scientist’s laboratory in the cellar, complete with blood-red walls, yards of glass tubes with coloured liquids bubbling over bunsen burners, and a stuffed cat. He met Hallard, who is eight years his junior, online. He claims it is the younger man’s pristine spelling and grammar that attracted him. They were married in 2008 at the Middle Temple in the City of London. Gatiss says he always knew that he was gay, though he had a girlfriend as a teenager, and that he accepted his real sexuality after a single afternoon of self-doubt. ‘I don’t think I was ever “in” with my friends,’ he says. Coming out to his parents was, however, much harder. It was only after leaving home that he plucked up the confidence to tell his mother the truth. She begged him to say nothing to his father, and promised she would break the news herself. A year later, Gatiss realised they had dealt with the problem by denying it to themselves, and he had to go through the ordeal of coming out all over again. That taught him, he says, never to put off difficult emotional decisions. Gatiss’s open homosexuality has led some to detect a gay frisson between his characterisation of Holmes and Watson. It’s a running joke that Inspector Lestrade and his colleagues regard 221b Baker Street as a gay love nest, and in the latest series landlady Mrs Hudson was incredulous at Watson’s protestations that he was getting engaged … ‘to a woman’. Purists have balked at such liberties with Conan Doyle’s creation, but they are part and parcel of Gatiss’s creativity. Homosexual undercurrents, vicious sibling rivalry, gothic shadows: these are the ingredients of his adolescence which today underpin his adult success. His next role — as a banker called Tycho Nestoris in the U.S. drama Game Of Thrones — has helped heal the rivalry with his brother. After decades of animosity, the two are back in contact and Gatiss says Phillip, now a postman, was ‘so excited’ to hear Mark has a part in the show that he loves. It is a remarkable rapprochement. But then, as fans of Sherlock will know, even Mycroft has moments when his little brother makes him proud.","Mark Gatiss based relationship between Holmes brothers on himself .

"The BBC's new multi-million pound television news studio has been built to be bomb proof to protect journalists from suicide attacks. The news room sits in a bunker under the main reception at the £1billion New Broadcasting House. Staff have been assured they would be protected from a blast should a suicide bomber walk through the front door at the central London facility. Bunker: The BBC's news room at New Broadcasting House is bomb proof to protect staff from suicide attacks . A BBC source told The Sunday Express: 'It's directly underneath so if a suicide bomber came in the front door they would be right over it. We've been assured it's bomb proof.' The BBC refused to comment on the claim however, saying: 'We never discuss security issues.' The news room, described as one of the largest in the world, will go live in March, broadcasting the BBC's three main daily bulletins at 1pm, 6pm and 10pm. The bulletins will undergo a makeover but the source said the changes will be subtle. But despite licence fee money being spent on the overhaul, there has reportedly been problems with getting the graphics to work, which could delay the launch. The source said bulletins may have to continue to be broadcast from Television Centre in White City while the glitches are ironed out, and added: 'It will obviously cost money to run two control rooms'. However, the BBC has denied this claim and said everything is 'running on schedule'. Revamp: The Corporation's three main daily television news bulletins will be broadcast from the £1bn facility . A spokesperson for the Corporation also said it 'never discusses security issues'. The news room, which includes a large LCD display screen dubbed a 'graphics halo' will be in view of the cameras behind a glass partion and journalists have been warned to be on their best behaviour. The insider added: 'They must keep their desks clear, no jackets on chairs and no eating.' New Broadcasting House has been funded by a 30-year bond deal and the Corporation says it will deliver savings of £750 million over the same period. It will open for public tours in April, having been more than 10 years in the making, and will be home to around 5,000 staff. It has included the refurbishment of the original Broadcasting House, which has been the home of BBC radio since 1932. BBC Spokesperson: 'New Broadcasting House provides new studios, new operating systems and new technology. 'New TV studios give us the opportunity to refresh the look and feel of our news programmes including updating captions and graphics, but the titles and overall BBC News brand that viewers have come to recognise and love including the globe and BBC News logos are not changing'.

"Millions of genetically modified mosquitoes could be released in the Florida Keys if British researchers win approval to use the bugs against two extremely painful viral diseases. But the move, if it goes ahead, would be unprecedented as  modified DNA insects have never been so close to being set loose in a residential U.S. neighborhood before. 'This is essentially using a mosquito as a drug to cure disease,' said Michael Doyle, executive director of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, which is waiting to hear if the Food and Drug Administration will allow the experiment. Brittany Mariscal, an entomological technician with the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, sorts and counts dead captured mosquitoes under a microscope in Key West, Florida . Dengue and chikungunya are growing threats in the U.S., but some people are more frightened at the thought of being bitten by a genetically modified organism. More than 130,000 signed a Change.org petition against the experiment. Even potential boosters say those responsible must do more to show that benefits outweigh the risks. 'I think the science is fine, they definitely can kill mosquitoes, but the GMO issue still sticks as something of a thorny issue for the general public,' said Phil Lounibos, who studies mosquito control at the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory. 'It's not even so much about the science — you can't go ahead with something like this if public opinion is negative.' Mosquito controllers say they're running out of options that can kill Aedes aegypti, a tiger-striped invader whose biting females spread these viruses. Climate change and globalization are spreading tropical diseases farther from the equator, and Key West, the southernmost U.S. city, is particularly vulnerable. 'An arriving person would be infectious for several days, and could infect many of the local mosquitoes,' Doyle said. 'Within a few weeks you'd likely end up with several infected mosquitoes for each infected visitor.' There are no vaccines or cures for dengue, known as 'break-bone fever,' or chikungunya, which causes painful contortions. U.S. cases remain rare for now, but dengue sickens 50 million people annually worldwide and kills 2.5 percent of the half-million who get severe cases, according to the World Health Organization. Chikungunya has already overwhelmed hospitals and harmed economies across the Caribbean after infecting a million people in the region last year. Jason Garcia, a field inspector with the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, tests a sprayer that could be used in the future to spray pesticides to control mosquitos in Key West . An Aedes aegypti mosquito feeds on the arm of Emilio Posada, the Upper Keys supervisor for the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, in Key Largo, Florida, they could soon be used to test and treat disease . Carrie Atwood, an entomological technician with the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, sorts and counts dead captured mosquitoes millions of genetically modified mosquitoes could be released in the Florida Keys . Insecticides are sprayed year-round from helicopters and door-to-door in charming and crowded neighborhoods throughout the Keys. But because Aedes aegypti don't travel much and are repeatedly doused with the same chemicals, they have evolved to resist four of the six insecticides used to kill them. Enter Oxitec, a British biotech firm launched by Oxford University researchers. They patented a method of breeding Aedes aegypti with fragments of proteins from the herpes simplex virus and E. coli bacteria as well as genes from coral and cabbage. This synthetic DNA has been used in thousands of experiments without harming lab animals, but it is fatal to the bugs, killing mosquito larvae before they can fly or bite. Oxitec's lab workers manually remove modified females, aiming to release only males, which feed on nectar and don't bite for blood like females do. The modified males then mate with wild females whose offspring die, reducing the population. Oxitec has built a breeding lab in Marathon and hopes to release its mosquitoes this spring in Key Haven, a neighborhood of 444 homes closely clustered on a relatively isolated peninsula at the north end of Key West. FDA spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman said no field tests will be allowed until the agency has 'thoroughly reviewed all the necessary information.' Company spokeswoman Chris Creese said the test will be similar in size to Oxitec's 2012 experiment in the Cayman Islands, where 3.3 million modified mosquitoes were released over six months, suppressing 96 percent of the targeted bugs. This undated photo made available by Oxitec shows a genetically modified Aedes aegypti mosquito in their U.K. lab . Oxitec says a later test in Brazil also was successful, and both countries now want larger-scale projects. But critics accused Oxitec of failing to obtain informed consent in the Caymans, saying residents weren't told they could be bitten by a few stray females overlooked in the lab. Instead, Oxitec said only non-biting males would be released, and that even if humans were somehow bitten, no genetically modified DNA would enter their bloodstream. Neither claim is entirely true, outside observers say. 'What Oxitec is trying to spin is that it's highly improbable that there will be negative consequences of this foreign DNA entering someone that's bitten by an Oxitec mosquito,' said Lounibos. 'I'm on their side, in that consequences are highly unlikely. But to say that there's no genetically modified DNA that might get into a human, that's kind of a gray matter.' Asked about these points, Creese says Oxitec has now released 70 million of its mosquitoes in several countries and received no reports of human impacts caused by bites or from the synthetic DNA, despite regulatory oversight that encourages people to report any problems. 'We are confident of the safety of our mosquito, as there's no mechanism for any adverse effect on human health. The proteins are non-toxic and non-allergenic,' she said. Oxitec should still do more to show that the synthetic DNA causes no harm when transferred into humans by its mosquitoes, said Guy Reeves, a molecular geneticist at Germany's Max Planck Institute. To build trust in any cutting-edge science, a range of independent experts — not just the company that stands to gain or the regulatory agency involved — should have enough access to data published in peer-reviewed journals to be able to explain the specific benefits and risks, he said. 'Failing to do this almost inevitably means a potential for controversy to be sustained and amplified,' said Reeves, adding that mosquito-borne diseases need more solutions. 'We should not be closing down productive avenues, and genetically modified mosquitoes might be one of them.' With the FDA watching, Doyle and Oxitec's product development manager, Derric Nimmo, checked their frustration at public meetings in November and December, repeatedly fielding the same questions from the same critics. Their selling points: . This experiment is self-limiting, using insects engineered to kill their progeny, not make them stronger. It is contained, since Oxitec's mosquitoes won't breed with other species. Killing off Aedes aegypti can protect human health while eliminating an invasive species. And most Key Haven residents responded positively to a district survey about the planned field test. Using GMOs also could save money: The district spends 10 percent of its budget on Aedes aegypti, which represents less than 1 percent of the 45 mosquito species buzzing around the Keys. Key Haven resident Marilyn Smith still wasn't persuaded. The Keys haven't experienced a dengue outbreak in years, and no chikungunya cases have been reported here, she said. 'If I knew that this was a real risk and lives could be saved, that would make sense,' Smith said. 'But there are no problems. Why are we trying to fix it? Why are we being used as the experiment, the guinea pigs, just to see what happens?' If the FDA decides against the test, or the modified mosquitoes fail to work as promised, Doyle will still need to kill the bugs. 'I'm convinced the only way to fight this is using the mosquitoes to fight each other,' he said.","Poised to be the first time GMO insects are released in U.S. residential area .

"Respected: Deborah Penny, 47, the first transgender soldier in battle, has won the respect of her comrades at Camp Bastion after her sex change . Battling the Taliban on the dusty battlefields of Afghanistan is one of the most difficult challenges a soldier can face. But Warrant Officer Class 2 Deborah Penny has shown huge bravery in another way – by becoming the first sex-change soldier to serve in a warzone in British Army history. The 47-year-old was born a man but is serving on the Helmand frontline as a woman. Military chiefs say the bomb disposal expert, who has served in the Army for 30 years, has won the respect of her comrades for her courage. The Royal Logistic Corps warrior, a former rugby player who used to be called David, dramatically changed her life in the macho military world by becoming the first transgender soldier in battle. A high-ranking Army source said: ‘Squaddies used to point her out at Camp Bastion as a novelty — but she has become accepted. ‘She wears the uniform like all the blokes and girls and has a feminine bob haircut. ‘Debbie is working in a male orientated world and has shown courage in deciding to change her life in such a dramatic manner and still pursue her career in a macho world.’ Explosives expert WO2 Penny, who used to serve in the Royal Green Jackets, now works alongside UK bomb disposal teams. As an ammunition technician, she makes sure soldiers do not accidentally bring explosives home from the warzone. Women can serve in any Army unit, including as Apache helicopter pilots targeting the Taliban, except those whose primary role is to ‘close with and kill’ - engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. But armed female soldiers do go out on patrol with combat units while serving as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, logisticians or signallers. Women have served with distinction, and been decorated, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and several have been killed in battle. Around 9,000 women serve in the Army – making up around 10 per cent of its total strength. WO2 Penny, of Colchester, Essex, has been living as a woman since 2007. Until 2000, gay personnel were banned from the military. The previous year, 298 people were discharged from the Army for their sexuality. But a legal victory for three gay men and a lesbian who had been kicked out of the Royal Navy and RAF brought a change. In 2008 Jan Hamilton, formerly Parachute Regiment Captain Ian Hamilton, was the first UK officer to complete gender reassignment from male to female. In battle: Explosives expert WO2 Penny in serving on the frontline in Helmand (pictured) as a woman . Another military sex change: Bradley Manning, US army whistleblower, is now Chelsea Manning . US army whistleblower Bradley Manning, jailed for leaking classified documents to Wikileaks, is also changing sex. Earlier this year, the British Army was named on gay campaign group Stonewall’s Top 100 Employers 2014 list, which names Britain’s most gay-friendly workplaces. The Ministry of Defence said the Armed Forces did not tolerate any form of harassment, victimisation or discrimination of transgender service personnel. A source said: ‘Our policy is that it is the right of each and every member of the Armed Forces to work in an environment which is free from intimidation and bullying and to expect to be treated with dignity and respect.’ An Army spokesman said: ‘The Armed Forces want to represent the breadth of the society we serve and we support all of our personnel, including those considering gender reassignment, by offering them the appropriate level of care and advice.’ The Armed Forces have a chequered history on equal rights but have improved in recent years: . 1696: Navy hires women as nurses and laundresses. 1800: Roles abolished. 1884-1918: Women allowed as nurses in Navy, Army and RAF. 1955-57: Homosexuality made an offence in all three services. 1967: Being gay decriminalised, but not in military. 1989-90: Women can pilot RAF combat aircraft and serve on warships. 1994: MoD says gay personnel can no longer be court-martialled but can be discharged. 2000: Policy barring gays from serving is axed. 2004: Military recognises civil partnerships. 2011: Women allowed to serve on submarines. 2012: Commander Sarah West becomes first female skipper of major warship. 2014: Women still barred from Army combat roles.","Deborah Penny, 47, was born a man but serves as a woman in Helmand .

Back to square one: Passengers were ferried back into Secaucus Junction, the site of hour-long waits that led to people passing out before the game . Buses were the better option: Fans who rode buses into the game were whisked out of New Jersey and back to Manhattan within minutes . Despite record ridership . causing massive inbound delays prior to the game, NJ Transit officials . had only one train platform open when the game let out. A . second platform was eventually opened, but the damage had been done - . 50 additional buses had to be brought in to move people out of the . parking lot, and it took more than two hours to get them to the port . Authority Bus Terminal on the edge of Manhattan's Times Square. Stadium . officials reopened the Chase Club inside, normally reserved only for .

'What do you expect when you don't give people any other option to get home,' added friend Willie Whitmore, a project manager. 'It's ridiculous.'

It appears that neither did officials, despite having hours to react to the disaster that was the ride in.

'We stood in line sweating, it’s absolute horse crap. As more trains arrived, police tried to thin the sweating, jostling crowd by spreading people across the platform. Initial fan calls of ""Seahawks"" and ""Broncos"" gave way to angry shouts of 'New Jersey, your Super Bowl sucks!' Law . enforcement officials in New York and New Jersey have ramped up . security in anticipation of Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford on . Sunday, utilizing just about everything in their arsenals - including . sharp-shooting snipers - to protect those in attendance from any . possible terrorist attack. 'We . were stuck in the tunnel for 30 minutes, it was probably 120 degrees,' said Jeff Dunbar, from Seattle. ‘People had to take their shirts off, it . was not good... people were chanting ‘Jersey sucks’ and blaming .

'Nobody . is telling anybody what’s going on...people are getting sick, they’re . feeling claustrophobic, there’s no air in there, there’s no water,' said . Bob Dowling, of New Providence, New Jersey. 'the wait is incredible, we . were back there a good one hour and fifteen minutes.' The . Super Bowl is what national security officials consider a 'level one . national security event' and may be a target for terrorists because of . the level of attention paid to the game. The added security proved to be too much for many in the crowd to handle. 'It . was 120 degrees in there with no air conditioning, everybody is . drenched,' said Dave Mannon, of Dallas, Texas. 'They even had to send in . medics because a few people passed out... I don’t think it’s working, I . think Governor Christie’s at it again.' Choked: Fans are packed in tightly as they make their way down the stairs at NJ Transit's Secaucus Junction . Mass of humanity: People stood in lines of almost an hour to transfer from buses and trains to rides to MetLife Stadium - there is usually no wait even prior to Giants and Jets games . Locked down: Police officers view football fans as they traverse the crowds . The added security measures also include high-altitude snipers working with security agents on the ground to make sure everyone is safe. If you have an active shooter or you have anyone who may have a bomb. Snipers have a better angle then anyone who is on the ground to actually . hit that target. It’s an entire team that communicates.

Additionally, . security officials are reviewing recent terrorist attacks in other . countries to determine how to prevent them from happening in the U.S. 'Certainly, . we're keeping an eye on activities around the world, but as of this . time, there are no threats directed against this event that we're aware . of,' New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton said a security . briefing in Manhattan. Because . this year's Super Bowl has the distinction of relying on mass transit . to take up to 30,000 fans to the game, the deadly bombings in the . southern Russian city of Volograd have raised worries here, said Col.

Trains, . buses and cars taking fans from New York and parts of New Jersey to the . stadium and back again 'are going to be scanned, they're going to be . checked, they're going to be swept,' he said. In . Manhattan, the NYPD is drawing on its experience securing the annual . New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, the New York City Marathon, . the U.N. General Assembly and other high-profile events to secure 'Super . Bowl Boulevard,' a 13-block street fair on Broadway. The . department has deployed hundreds of extra uniformed and plainclothes . police officers to the area. It's also relying on bomb-sniffing dogs, . portable radiation detectors and a vast network of surveillance cameras . to detect trouble. In . the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, the NYPD rehearsed its response . to a variety of potential threats, including 'the backpack left . unsecured scenario,' Bratton said. 'We are very, very well-prepared.' Capacity: People already are filing into MetLife Stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford, New Jersey . Target: The Super Bowl is considered by security officials to be a 'level one national security event' The state police plan to . assign up to 700 troopers at the stadium on Sunday, Fuentes said. A . security center has been set up in a hollowed-out building across a . highway from the stadium that's slated to become a mammoth retail and . entertainment complex. A . 24-hour FBI command center will monitor the latest counterterrorism . intelligence, said Aaron Ford, head of the FBI's Newark office. Measures . have been taken to protect power grids and to make sure there's plenty . of backup energy in case of another blackout like the one last year at . the game in New Orleans, said Jeffrey Miller, the NFL's head of . security. 'This year . we're going to try to go blackout free,' Miller said. 'One thing that . I've learned is that you don't want to be overconfident. You want to . prepare and be ready. You just don't know what you might face on game . day.' Randy Killikevc, a . tourist from Tennessee who attended a Super Bowl party in Byrant Park . on Wednesday, said possible threats against the Super Bowl weren't on . his mind. 'If terrorists were going to strike New York why not do it on New Year's Eve? There's lots more people here (then),' he said.","Fans poured out of the stadium only to be gridlocked in hours-long waits for trains at only ONE train platform .
Officials eventually opened a second platform, but had to bring in 50 buses to help ferry people out .
Stadium officials and New Jersey State Police begged fans to remain inside the stadium until congestion eased .
About 28,000 people rode mass transit to the Super Bowl - double official estimates - and two hours after the game they had only been taken to Secaucus Junction, where long lines plagued fans only hours earlier ."
"Isabelle 'Barbara' Fiske Calhoun, a New York cartoonist who moved to Vermont just after World War Two to co-found what is now described as Vermont's 'oldest alternative and artist's retreat,' died at age 94. Calhoun's daughter, Isabella Fiske McFarlin, said her mother died on Monday in White River Junction. She did not give a cause of death. She said Calhoun - then Isabella Fiske - and her husband, Irving Fiske, Bohemian intellectuals from New York, used wedding money in 1946 to buy a 140-acre hill farm in Rochester that later became a 'hippie commune' known as the Quarry Hill Creative Center. 'Commune founder': This undated photo provided by Jim Drougas shows Isabelle Calhoun, who co-founded what is now described as Vermont's 'oldest alternative and artist's retreat' Younger years: Isabelle Calhoun, who bought the Vermont farm in 1946 with her husband at the time, Irving Fiske, is seen here . Commune: This undated photo shows people relaxing at the commune, which became popular in the 1960s . It was initially intended to be a summer home, but they stayed. In 1984 Irving Fiske told The Associated Press, 'We're free and easy. We're not very authoritative. We have no doctrine, no dogma. It is a community of mostly people who are interested in the arts, literature, photography, music.' In the 1960s, young people moved to Quarry Hill - lured by the land - and began to build houses and have children. Quarry Hill soon had its own school, and by the 1990s about 90 people lived on the 140 acres full-time. 'They opened it to who ever wanted to come,' McFarlin said. 'There were two rules, no hitting the kids and no hunting or fishing.' Now there are about 25, McFarlin said. 'They finally make it': This undated photo shows commune residents carrying goods on the grounds . Free love? 'Hippies' can be seen at the Quarry Hill Creative Center in this undated photograph . The arrival of the Fiskes in the 1940s belies the popular conception that it wasn't until the 1960s that the state became a magnet for what became known as the counterculture that over time helped transform Vermont, said University of Vermont history professor Dona Brown, who has written about the back-to-the-land movement. 'It sounds to me very much like the story of a lot of movement, mostly from New York City's kind of Bohemian arty scene in the '30s and '40s and buying up old farms,' Brown said. 'Often (they came) with a kind of common political or common cultural expectation that this would be a place where they could be free and where they wouldn't be subjected to a lot of pressure,' Brown said. 'And also where they could live cheaply. For artists that's always been a really big selling point for Vermont, is that you could spread out and live in relative comfort.' Calhoun was born in Tucson, Ariz., on Sept. 9, 1919. She attended art school in Los Angeles and moved to New York around 1940. During the war, when male cartoonists were away on military duty, she drew 'Girl Commandoes' and other strips for Harvey Comics. An obituary provided by her family said she had to draw under the name 'B. Hall' as cartooning was 'a man's profession' at the time. Irving Fiske was a freelance writer who won acclaim in the 1940s for a modern translation of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet.' He died in 1990 at age 82.","Isabelle Fiske Calhoun died on Monday at age 94 .

"Protestors in the Ukraine have installed a golden toilet on a plinth that was once the home of a statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. A student group in Kiev placed the toilet there as a scathing commentary on allegations of corruption among government ministers. Among the accusations against Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych that have fueled the demonstrations is the charge that he had gold toilets installed at his sprawling country estate near Kiev. Crowds look at a golden toilet installed by activists on a pedestal where a statue of Lenin used to stand in Kiev.  Right, a student installs the toilet . Rage: The statue was torn down in protest at closer ties to Moscow . Earlier, Ukrainian activists targeted the Kiev offices of Germany's Deutsche Bank, claiming that it was handling corruption money from President Viktor Yanukovych's inner circle. Protestors are angry that the government has moved away from a closer relationship with the EU to develop stronger ties with Russia. The statue was torn down as a gesture rejecting Moscow's historic influence over Ukraine. Ukrainian opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, after meeting with the country's beleaguered president, is warning that tempers are heating up and says the president must take action to resolve the country's political crisis. The statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin before it was torn down . The former boxer's meeting on Tuesday with President Viktor Yanukovych came as parliament held a session that took no action. Two months of protests have put Yanukovych under substantial pressure. But he has made no moves to work with the opposition since last week, when he pushed parliament to pass a measure providing amnesty to many arrested protesters if demonstrators vacate buildings they occupy. Protesters rejected that condition and continue to seek Yanukovych's resignation and early elections. After the meeting, Klitschko said: 'The temperature of society is growing and I told the president we have to immediately take a decision.' Meanwhile, the leader of a main anti-government group in Ukraine fled to the UK after a warrant was issued for his arrest in Kiev. Oleksandr Danylyuk, 39, leads Spilna Sprava is wanted by the Ministry of Interior for provoking mass anti-government protests, an offence punishable by 15 years in jail. Danylyuk's personal Facebook page states he is now in London with his wife and children having crossed the border 'by foot' on January 28. A source close to the activist said: 'He has good connections in London and a lot of friends there, but his reasons for coming are political and not related to business. 'It is quite possible that Zhena . Tymoshenko [daughter of Yulia Tymoshenko] helped organise his family's . move, since Spilna Sprava have connections with this camp.'

Tension: Ukrainian opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, after meeting with the country's beleaguered president, is warning that tempers are heating up . Zhena Tymoshenko's spokesperson denied there are any ties. Writing on his Facebook page, Danylyuk said he had little faith in the so-called amnesty being offered by the government. 'This will not protect anyone from further repression, especially as the kidnapping and murder of activists are extralegal acts. 'We are confronted with maniac serial killers with whom it is impossible to find a compromise,"" he said. Danylyuk also wrote on the social networking site that he plans to continue his activism from the UK.","The statue of former Soviet leader was torn down in December .

"A multi-millionaire businessman who owns a 'chunk' of Laura Ashley and his estranged wife have resumed a High Court battle over money - months after a judge urged them to try to find a resolution. In July, Mr Justice Bodey called on Khoo Kay Peng, 75, and Pauline Chai, who is in her 60s, to find a solution without doing more damage to themselves after hearing that they had run up legal bills of more than £2million. But lawyers today returned to court for the latest stage of the divorce cash fight. Khoo Kay Peng (right) and Pauline Chai (left) disagree over where their divorce cash fight should be staged .

Mrs Chai, who lives in England, says it should take place there. Mr Justice Bodey is expected to make decisions about where litigation should be staged after hearing legal argument from both sides. Judges have heard that Dr Khoo and Mrs Chai, a former beauty queen, have five grown-up children and were married for more than 40 years. Pauline Chai, pictured as a former Miss Malaysia in 1969. She now lives in the UK . They have been told that the issue at the centre of the case is how big a payment Dr Khoo will make to Mrs Chai for the part she played in their 42-year 'matrimonial partnership'. Mrs Chai says her husband is worth more than £400 million and says the amount she should get should run into hundreds of millions of pounds. In July, Mr Justice Bodey said: 'I urge the parties to use their best endeavours with the help of their legal teams to resolve these extremely expensive proceedings without doing more damage to themselves.' Earlier this year, another judge described the amounts spent on preliminary legal 'skirmishes' as 'eye-watering'. Mr Justice Holman said Dr Khoo owned a 'chunk' of Laura Ashley and had properties in England and Malaysia worth more than £50million.

"Jimmy Savile was implicated in the Haut de la Garenne children's home scandal, according to the former head of the Jersey child abuse investigation . Lenny Harper said he now has 'no reason to doubt' that Savile indecently assaulted girls at the Jersey children's home which came under intense scrutiny in 2008. His comments came on the day that the BBC's director general, George Entwistle, ordered a belated inquiry into the abuse scandal and offered an apology to Savile's victims. Jersey's former Deputy Chief Officer Lenny Harper outside the former Haut de la Garenne children's home where Sir Jimmy Savile is alleged to have indecently assaulted a girl . Harper, the States of Jersey police detective who led a three-year child abuse probe, told the Guardian that Savile's name came up in the initial police inquiry four years ago. However, he added that there were no specific allegations of abuse against the BBC presenter at the time. Mr Harper, who has since retired from the force, added: 'There definitely wasn't enough even to question him at the time, but in light of all the evidence that has come out then I'm not surprised because it fits perfectly the profile of what was going on.' The institution was subject to a huge police investigation after allegations of historic child abuse at the home. A solicitor who acted for victims also . told the Guardian that some former Haut de la Garenne residents, both . women and men, now claim they were assaulted by Savile in the 1970s. Alan . Collins, a solicitor for several Haut de la Garenne victims, said 'a . handful' of former residents have now made abuse allegations about . Savile. He said Savile's . name was mentioned several times during the police investigation of 2008 . but  the evidence did not seem to stack up at the time. Implicated: Sir Jimmy Savile relaxing at his flat in Leeds. Since his death he has been linked to the notorious children's home scandal in Jersey . The late DJ and television presenter surrounded by girls at a Radio 1 event near his home in Leeds in 2000 . The late presenter on his programme Jim'll Fix It. Lenny Harper says he has 'no reason to doubt' he was involved in indecent assault . Police on the island confirmed last . week that Savile was investigated as part of the 2008 inquiry into abuse . at the children's home. It followed claims from a former Haut de la Garenne resident that Savile was involved in an indecent assault in the 1970s. The BBC entertainer, who died last October aged 84, was never charged with any abuse offences. Mr Entwistle . yesterday admitted knowing about the Newsnight investigation into Savile when . he ploughed ahead with eulogies showering tributes on the presenter. He . expressed ‘deep regret’ over ‘these awful allegations’ as he announced . his U-turn on Radio 4, having previously insisted that no BBC inquiry . was necessary. Newsnight's . film was shelved, and instead viewers and listeners were treated to a . series of programmes lavishing praise on Savile after his death. Apology: BBC director-general George Entwistle expressed 'deep regret' over 'these awful allegations' as he announced his U-turn on Radio 4, having previously insisted that no BBC inquiry was necessary . Investigations: Detectives are to probe whether Sir Jimmy Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice . Nationwide inquiry: Staff at the BBC have been urged to come forward with information about Jimmy Savile's alleged reign of abuse as police forces across the country receive more allegations . At least seven police forces are now examining claims he raped and molested schoolgirls during four decades as a radio and TV presenter. Detectives will also probe whether Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice. Both women have reported their claims to police. A week ago, the corporation insisted it had ‘no evidence' of any abuse, but yesterday Mr Entwistle told Radio 4 he wanted to apologise to women victims ‘on behalf of the organisation …for what they've had to endure here'. Presenter Evan Davies asked him why the BBC ran a eulogy on Savile after evidence of abuse surfaced during the Newsnight inquiry. Mr Entwistle, who was the BBC's Head of Vision at the time, said: ‘I didn't know what had become of that investigation, I didn't know what discoveries, if any, that they had.' Last week it was announced that Savile could be posthumously stripped of his knighthood in a virtually unprecedented move, if the extraordinary claims that he sexually abused young girls are found to be true. The TV host was knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award which followed the OBE he was given for services to charity and broadcasting in 1971. But a Cabinet Office source said that a knighthood could be removed after an individual’s death if they are officially censured by a professional body or convicted of a criminal offence. The calls for him to be stripped of his knighthood were backed by a 65-year-old woman, who claimed she became pregnant after the presenter raped her when she was a virgin aged 16.","Lenny Harper's comments came as the BBC ordered a belated inquiry .

Modern: The Giant's Causeway Visitor's Centre in Northern Ireland features on the shortlist of six for the Royal Institute of British Architects' 2013 Stirling Prize . Contemporary: A housing project on the shortlist is Newhall Be in Harlow, Essex, a group of 84 new homes which 'raises the bar for suburban housing developments' Interior: The winner of the contenders - including Newhall Be in Harlow - will be announced on September 26 at Central Saint Martins, King's Cross . Also competing for the 2013 award are a new visitor centre at the Giant's Causeway, an estate of new homes in Essex and a new medical school building. Bookmaker William Hill has installed Bishop Edward King Chapel in Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire, as the favourite to win the prize. The £2million building, finished earlier this year, was built for Ripon College and an order of nuns, the Community of St John the Baptist, and it features a series of high windows which flood it with natural light. Judges said that it ‘fulfils its complex brief with a lyrical grace’. Also on the list is the once-despised Park Hill tower block complex in Sheffield which has been given a contemporary refit. The half-century old ‘brutalist’ concrete estate was given Grade II listing in 1997 but for many in the city it had long been an unloved eyesore until it was given an overhaul. This included preserving a notable piece of graffiti in neon lights, reading ‘I love you will u marry me’.

The shortlist includes five architecture firms which have never previously figured in the list. Angela Brady, Riba's president, said: ‘The Riba Stirling Prize is awarded to the building that has made the biggest contribution to the evolution of architecture, and nowhere is the need for fresh-thinking needed more than in housing. ‘The UK is blighted with unimaginative, poor quality houses that people don't want to live in but have little other choice, so I am delighted to see two amazing and highly original housing projects on this year's shortlist. ‘These projects show how when talented architects and clients work together and focus on quality, affordable and desirable new homes can be created. They shine a light on what the future of UK housing can be. ‘All six shortlisted projects are ground-breaking in their own way - buildings that deliver more than could ever have been expected. 'Some of them, such as Park Hill and the Giant's Causeway Visitor Centre, are genuinely courageous in laying out a new visionary approach. This RIBA Stirling Prize shortlist is sending out the clear message that creative vision improves our lives.’ The winner will be announced on September 26 at Central Saint Martins in King's Cross, central London.","Shortlist of six buildings for Royal Institute of British Architects' Stirling Prize for top buildings .

"HMRC chief executive Lin Homer refused to rule out using controversial snooping powers against future whistleblowers . Britain's tax boss last night refused to rule out using anti-terrorist powers again to target whistleblowers. Three years ago, HM Revenue & Customs sparked fury by invoking the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) against an employee who revealed its sweetheart deal with Goldman Sachs. Internal investigators snooped on his emails, internet records and phone calls to find out whether he had leaked the story to a newspaper. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the powerful Commons public accounts committee, said the actions had shocked her ‘to the bone’ and had left the whistleblower a ‘broken man’. But when questioned by MPs yesterday, HMRC chief executive Lin Homer refused to rule out using Ripa against future whistleblowers. The MPs also heard from one NHS whistleblower whose mental health problems were used against her when she tried to expose a cover-up at the Care Quality Commission watchdog. Committee member Richard Bacon said: ‘This is the sort of thing that used to happen in the Soviet Union’. Mrs Hodge said there was a ‘culture of fear’ across the public sector that stopped workers speaking out to report abuses. A Department of Health official admitted that a survey had found barely half of NHS staff said they would feel confident doing so. MPs grilled Mrs Homer about the case of Osita Mba, an HMRC employee who exposed the deal which allowed Goldman Sachs to escape paying £10million in interest on unpaid tax. The story appeared in The Guardian and it emerged soon after that HMRC had used Ripa powers to snoop on Mr Mba’s emails and phone to try to prove he had leaked the story. The powers are supposed to be used to combat terrorism and large-scale criminal tax frauds. Mr Mba, who worked in the personal tax litigation team, was suspended by HMRC. He was also due to appear in front of the committee, but pulled out. Mrs Hodge told Mrs Homer: ‘The thing which shocked me most was that you made a request under Ripa, which in effect is there to deal with terrorism. Margaret Hodge said there was a 'culture of fear' across the public sector that stopped workers speaking out to report abuses . What I want to hear from you is that you’ll never do that again when you’ve got a whistleblower. ‘It shocked me to my bone that these very very, very extreme powers were being used and that he was hounded to the extent that you’ve broken him. The department has broken him and it’s awful.’ Mrs Homer refused to say it would never happen again, because HMRC had a duty of care to both its staff and taxpayers’ expectation that their affairs would be confidential. Although the committee invited whistleblowers from the worlds of health, education, police, local government and HMRC, only one – from health – felt brave enough to appear. Kay Sheldon worked at the CQC but was denigrated and told she had a mental health problem when she tried to expose a cover-up.","Supposed to be used to combat terrorism and large-scale tax frauds .

"Guilty: Nurse Roger Dean, 37, admitted killing 11 elderly residents of the nursing home where he worked, and is serving a life sentence, but it has now been revealed that Dean had covered up the fact that he had been sacked for turning up at a previous job with slurred speech and frothing at the mouth from drug use . The nurse convicted of murdering 11 elderly people after starting a fire inside a nursing home had been suspending from his previous job because he was frothing at the mouth on drugs. An inquest into the deaths of 14 people after a 2011 fire at the Quakers Hill Nursing Home in 2011 also heard Roger Dean had previously vandalised a former boss's car. Dean has been jailed for life for 11 counts of murder and eight counts of causing reckless bodily harm after he started the fire in the early hours of November 18 after being caught stealing drugs. Police had questioned Dean, then aged  35, about stealing prescription drugs just hours before he lit the blaze which gutted the nursing home in the far western Sydney suburb of Quakers Hill in the early hours of November 18, 2011. The inquest heard that the nursing home had failed to check Dean's work references and did not make him undergo a mental health check. Eleven residents aged between 73 and 90 died immediately and there were three further deaths due to injuries. A coronial inqiury into the tragedy, which has opened in a Sydney court on Monday, has heard that the nursing home had employed Dean on the basis of out-of-date resume. He was also the head nurse on the night of the blaze. Dean had made no mention of the fact that he had been suspended from a previous job because of his drug use. Dean was drug affected while working at the St John of God Hospital, a private psychiatric care facility in the inner-western Sydney suburb of Burwood, in 2011. A patient complained Dean couldn't administer her medication properly, had white froth around his mouth and struggled to speak. Terrible memories: Ella Vikay (pictured, leaving Glebe Coroners Court on Monday) was among the relatives of the 14 victims who died as a result of the Quakers Hill Nursing Home fire who packed the public gallery for the first day of the coronial inquiry into the tragedy. Ms Vikay lost her mother in the fire which tore through the home in November, 2011, after it was deliberately lit by nurse Roger Dean, killing men and women aged between 73 and 96 years old . Sick history: Roger Dean is questioned by police about the fire he lit at Quakers Hill Nursing Home. An inquest has now revealed that Dean, who lit the fire hours after he was caught stealing drugs, had previously been suspended for arriving at work 'frothing at the mouth' from drugs, and had vandalised the car of another previous boss with nails and paint . No way out: An inquest into the November 2011 fire at Quakers Hill Nursing Home (pictured) in western Sydney which resulted in 14 deaths, has heard that the beds of residents couldn't be evacuated because of a narrow and illegally built ramp . Casualties: The November 2011 fire caused the deaths of 14 people, 11 in the immediate fire and three later from injuries . A staff member later noticed he looked sedated, the inquest heard, and that Dean blamed the medication he was taking for a bipolar disorder. For his Quakers Hill interview, Dean only listed recent employment was at a cheesecake shop where his flatmate had worked. The inquest was told Dean had also poured paint over a previous employer's car and put nails in the tyres. The five-day inquiry opened with relatives of the victims packing the public gallery of Glebe Coroner's Court. Deputy state coroner Hugh Dillon described the fire as a 'rare and devastating' event. The inquest heard the ramp which led from the Quakers Hill Nursing Home was too narrow to take beds, hampering evacuation of patients. Among the patients residing in the home at the time of the fire were blind people, others confined to their beds and some with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, the inquest was told. 'Nightmare': Many of the home's 88 elderly residents struggled to get themselves out through thick smoke . Evacuation hampered: a ramp which was too narrow for bedridden patients to be wheeled out hampered the rescue operation by firefighters after 80 people were trapped in the nursing home following the fire . Sentencing: Roger Dean is serving life in prison after admitting to the murders which happened after he deliberately lit the nursing home fire to cover up his drug theft . One woman resident had an amputated leg and was confined to a wheelchair, ABC News reported. Mr Dillon said the inquest was not investigating Dean's criminal actions. He said the inquest would try to determine what lessons could be learned from the fire. 'The community is behind you,' he told the victims' families in the gallery. 'Our concerns are your concerns.' Counsel assisting the coroner, Kristina Stern, said a ramp at the home made it difficult for staff to manoeuvre beds when they were trying to evacuate more than 80 residents. The ramp's problems may not have been properly addressed during fire safety training for staff, and the ramp was constructed without council planning permission. Roger Dean was on night duty on November 16, 2011 when he set the fire. CCTV captured Dean entering the treatment room, where medication is kept, 36 times. A later audit of the room found 237 tablets of Endone, a strong opiate-based pain medication, missing. Police questioned him at the home hours before the blaze over allegations of stealing the drugs, to which he later pleaded guilty. A nursing home staff member remarked she was scared to leave her staff alone with Dean, the inquest heard. Ms Stern said Dean used a staff member's cigarette lighter to set a sheet on a bed on fire in two rooms in the nursing home. He later appeared on television describing his efforts to rescue trapped people in the nursing home. After the fire, Dean told journalists he had braved the smoke to rescue those trapped inside as the home's 88 residents were evacuated. He said: 'I just quickly did what I could to get everyone out.' Following the tragedy, NSW fire commissioner Greg Mullins described the blaze as 'a firefighter's worst nightmare'. He said: 'Turning up to a nursing home with elderly people who can't get themselves out of harm's way... 'Firefighters could not see their hands in front of their faces in the . thick smoke so you can imagine what it was like for the elderly trying . to escape.' He said that firefighters had crawled . into the building through the thick smoke, reaching up to feel into beds . to establish if there was anyone there who they could rescue. The fire was Sydney's worst nursing home disaster since 16 elderly residents died in a blaze in suburban Sylvania Heights in 1981.","An inquest into the fatal 2011 Quakers Hill nursing home fire has opened .

"Ministers attempting to crack down on civil servants’ perks have hit an unexpected barrier – the Queen. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude wanted to cut the two-and-a-half ‘privilege’ days that staff get on top of their 30 days’ annual leave and bank holidays. But The Mail on Sunday has been told the plan was altered after it was discovered one of the days had been personally granted to the Civil Service by the Queen on her Coronation 60 years ago. Decisive: A Whitehall source said plans to cut the holiday allowance were quashed when the Palace reportedly indicated it would be very difficult . Crackdown: Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude wanted to get rid of the privilege days awarded to his staff . A Whitehall source said the reform had been defeated by a combination of constitutional law and the threat of compensation claims from the Civil Service. He added: ‘Soundings from the Palace were that this would be very difficult and might involve a Royal Charter.’ The Cabinet Office said: ‘Civil servants are currently entitled to two-and-a-half privilege days. It was decided that it was appropriate to make changes to one-and-a-half days, and leave the Queen’s birthday as it is.’ Senior civil servants agreed to forgo . the one-and-a-half days. But it has now emerged that this time has been . added to their annual leave. Austere times: Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons Public Administration Committee said privilege days were not acceptable in the current economic climate . Holiday maker: The Queen granted the Civil service and extra day off each year on her Coronation 60 years ago . One Whitehall source described the move as ‘cooking the books’ to disguise the fact that staff will be keeping their extra holidays. Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons Public Administration Committee, said: ‘Things like privilege days are at complete variance with the urgency and pace that we require from the Civil Service, particularly in the present economic times.’ A Palace spokesman said that the decision to keep the Queen’s birthday privilege day was ‘entirely’ that of the Cabinet Office. He declined to discuss any talks between officials about the proposal.","Civil servants given two and a half 'privilege' days on top of 30 days annual leave .

"Scientists in Austria have found 19 living descendants of a prehistoric iceman whose 5,300-year-old body was found frozen in the Alps. Researchers from the Institute of Legal Medicine at Innsbruck Medical University took DNA samples from blood donors in Tyrol in the west of the country. They managed to match a particular genetic mutation with that of Ötzi, whose body was discovered back in 1991. Descendants: Scientists have found 19 living relatives of Ötzi the Iceman who was found frozen in the Alps . Only a very small number of select individuals from history have had their genetic codes sequenced before, and none with Richard III's noble pedigree. They include Otzi the iceman, pictured, whose mummified 3,000-year-old remains were found in the Italian Alps in 1991 . Experts now believe that the same mutation might also be found in the nearby rgions of Engadine in Switzerland and the South Tyrol region of Italy. According to the BBC, Walther Parson from the university, said: 'We have already found Swiss and Italian partners so that we can pursue our research.' DNA from around 3,700 blood donors were analysed and the men were also asked to provide information on their ancestry. None of the donors have been informed that they are distantly related to Ötzi. Since the body was found frozen under the Alps two decades ago, scientists have conducted experiments to learn how he came to be buried between the Austrian and Italian borders more than 5,300 years ago. Preserved: Ötzi is kept in a specially built museum in Bolzano, Italy. Visitors view the mummy through portholes into a specially refrigerated room . A hole in his collarbone suggested he was killed by an arrow, then a brain scan concluded he died from a fall. But research earlier this year, from the European Academy of Bolzano/Bozen (EURAC) in Germany, discovered he suffered brain damage likely caused by a blow to the head. In 2001, scientists from Austria's Innsbruck University scanned Ötzi using a CAT scan. They found dark spots at the back of the iceman mummy's cerebrum and concluded he may have died from a head injury. It was suggested that falling, after being hit by the arrow, or while climbing, may have caused this head injury. History: The mummy was found in September 1991 in the Ötztal Alps, hence the name Ötzi, near the Similaun mountain and Hauslabjoch on the border between Austria and Italy . The mummy was found in September 1991 in the Ötztal Alps, hence the name Ötzi, near the Similaun mountain and Hauslabjoch on the border between Austria and Italy. Scientists estimate he was aged around 45, was 5ft 5"" tall and weighed about 7.9st when he died. Ötzi is kept in a specially built museum in Bolzano, Italy. Visitors view the mummy through portholes into a specially refrigerated room. The hunter was frozen with all his possessions including a bow, a quiver of arrows and a copper axe. He was wearing warm clothing including a cloak made of woven grass, a coat and leggings made from goatskin and a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap. DNA analysis has revealed details of the iceman's life . The 5,300-year-old 'ice mummy' known as Ötzi suffered from the world's first-known case of Lyme disease, a bacterial parasite spread by ticks, according to new DNA analysis. Ötzi, who was 46 at the time of his death and measured 5ft2, also had brown eyes, had relatives in Sardinia, and was lactose intolerant. Ötzi was also predisposed to heart disease. The new research focused on the DNA in the nuclei of Ötzi's cells, and could yield further insights into the famous 'ice mummy's life. He was unearthed in September 1991 by a couple of German tourists trekking through the Oetz Valley, after which he was named. He was about 46 years old when he met his death. The iceman has been crucial to our understanding of how prehistoric people lived, what they wore and even what they ate. Researchers examining the contents of his stomach worked out that his final meal consisted of venison and ibex meat. Archaeologists believe Otzi, who was carrying a bow, a quiver of arrows and a copper axe, may have been a hunter or warrior killed in a skirmish with a rival tribe. Researchers say he was about 159cm tall (5ft 2.5in), 46 years old, arthritic and infested with whipworm, an intestinal parasite. His perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Italy at a constant temperature of -6°C. Visitors can view the mummy through a small window. Alongside his remains is a new Otzi model created using 3D images of the corpse and forensic technology by two Dutch artists – Alfons and Adrie Kennis.","Austrian scientists tested the DNA of 3,700 male blood donors in Tyrol .

"Hero: Sergeant Johnson Beharry is showing off his newborn son Ayden in an interview with Hello! magazine . Military hero Johnson Beharry, who became the first recipient of the Victoria Cross for more than two decades in 2005, has had tiny replicas of his medals made for his newborn son. Sergeant Beharry, 34, showed off his son Ayden for the first time in an interview with Hello! magazine and said that he never imagined he would become a father. He was the first serviceman honoured with the VC in 23 years after risking his life to save his colleagues in Iraq, suffering horrific injuries in the process. Sergeant Beharry told the magazine: 'Before Iraq I never imagined being a dad. I lived on the edge and thought it was inevitable that I would die. 'I wonder how I survived. Everyone tells me I must be here for a reason. Maybe it is my work with my charity. But it's also for Ayden.' Beharry, who still bears the scars of his ordeal, including a titanium plate in his skull, married second wife Mallissa in March, just five months after they met. He said of his son: 'I love him so much that I don't want to go to bed, I just want to be with him. 'I hold him and watch him as he sleeps, then stay awake until dawn. My job is being on guard in the army, so it comes naturally to me.' Beharry - who has appeared on ITV's Dancing On Ice series - said he had the mini replica medals done for his son as a tribute to him. His wife said he was a hands-on father adding: 'He loves being with him. Whenever he speaks, Ayden opens his eyes and tries to find him. Johnson wants to be involved with everything.' Honour: Beharry became the first person to be awarded the Victoria Cross since the Falklands War . Serviceman: He was awarded the honour after he risked his own life and suffered horrendous injuries saving the lives of some of his colleagues in Iraq . The couple tied the knot at London's Old Marylebone Hotel in March in front of family and friends, before moving on to a later blessing. Delight: Sergeant Beharry spoke of his joy at the birth of his son in an interview with Hello! magazine . They announced soon after that they were expecting their first child. The Grenada-born soldier said at the time: ‘It's a little sooner than planned, but we are over the moon. ‘Mallissa and I felt strongly that it was important to marry before our baby arrives. 'I didn't grow up with a mum and dad who were together and all my life I've said I don't want my child to say the same and that I want them to know they've got that solid foundation.’ Beharry received his VC for two acts of bravery. In the first he led a patrol to safety after being ambushed and under heavy fire, and in the other he saved the lives of several colleagues despite suffering brain and facial injuries from a grenade. He split from first wife Lynthia in 2005 as a result of the traumatic experiences he endured. Beharry became the first recipient in 2005 of the Victoria Cross since the Falklands War of 1982. He is one of only six living recipients of the VC. Johnson Beharry was born one of eight children on the Caribbean island of Grenada in 1979. He moved to Britain in 1999, joining the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment in 2001, serving first in Kosovo then Northern Ireland.","Sergeant Beharry, 34, spoke of his delight at Ayden's birth in Hello! magazine .

"Part of the House of Lords has been searched by police investigating historic child sex abuse claims against a Labour peer. Up to eight officers from Leicestershire Police swooped on the office of Greville Janner as part of an ongoing inquiry linked to children’s homes in the county. Officers took the highly unusual step of entering Parliament to raid his office and seize computer equipment just weeks before submitting a dossier on the peer to the Crown Prosecution Service. The offices of Lord Janner were raided by officers from Leicestershire police in March, it has emerged . The move came after police spent several days searching the 85-year-old politician’s home in Golders Green, north-west London, in December. The widowed father of three, a Labour MP in Leicester from 1970 to 1997, has not been arrested in connection with the allegations and police have yet to send a full file of evidence to the CPS. But preliminary papers have been served to prosecutors who are advising detectives on the progress of the investigation which started last year after a man came forward claiming he was abused as a teenager in the 1970s by Lord Janner. The probe has been linked to pervert Frank Beck, who was found guilty of abusing more than 100 children in the 1970s and 1980s. Beck, who ran three children’s homes in Leicestershire, was given five life sentences and died behind bars. Two hundred children complained they had been abused by him over 13 years to 1986. In Beck’s 1991 trial, a 30-year-old man said he had been abused by Lord Janner, who was still an MP at the time, while he was in care aged 13. Lord Janner was not prosecuted and received cross-party support in the Commons when he said there was ‘not a shred of truth’ in the claims. Police rarely enter the Houses of Parliament because of the age-old principle of parliamentary privilege intended to guarantee politicians’ freedom of speech. It is highly unusual for police to enter the House of Parliament to carry out searches, because MPs and peers are usually protected by parliamentary privilege. In the past decade, searches of members’ offices have been carried out only a handful of times. The Commons office of former Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was raided last year by police investigating allegations of rape and sexual assault. He was later acquitted. In 2008 the Metropolitan Police searched the office of Tory immigration spokesman Damian Green over allegations he had leaked information from the Home Office. Mr Green denied this and in 2009 the CPS said it would not be bringing charges against him. To obtain permission to search a member’s office, police have to go through a lengthy process which involves getting a search warrant sanctioned by a judge before alerting the Clerk of the Parliaments and Black Rod, a senior officer in the Lords responsible for security. Yesterday Leicestershire Police refused to confirm what was seized during the raid which took place in March but was only made public yesterday. But a spokesman said the search was monitored by senior House of Lords officials, adding: ‘No arrests or charges have been made and enquiries continue.’ Two men aged 69 and 63 from Corby, Northamptonshire, have been quizzed in connection with the allegations but not arrested. Lord Janner, who was appointed a QC in 1971, is a prominent campaigner for Jewish rights and a former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. His legal team has confirmed he is helping with inquiries, but Lord Janner was unavailable for comment yesterday.","Leicestershire police carry out search of office in Houses of Parliament .

"It would be the biggest airport in the world. Jutting out into the Thames Estuary, it would serve 150million passengers a year – more than twice as many as Heathrow – and operate 24 hours a day. This is Thames Hub, the astonishing £50billion vision to solve London’s aviation crisis. Proposal: The estuary airport would be a transport hub with trains able to speed passengers all over Europe and Britain after they land . Yesterday, plans were unveiled for the four-runway airport on a sparse strip of land on the Isle of Grain, in Kent. Designed by architect Lord Norman . Foster – who created the new Wembley Stadium – the airport would be a . modern-day feat of British engineering built on reclaimed marshland. It . would include the UK’s busiest railway station, handling 300,000 . passengers a day. Icon: Norman Foster designed the new Wembley Stadium, and he is looking to create something similarly distinctive at the Thames Hub . Planes would fly in from the . north-east, primarily over water, greatly reducing the number of homes . that would be affected by aircraft noise. With the Government having admitted . in August that London’s main airports will reach bursting point in 2030 – . and a third runway at Heathrow  having been ruled out – backers of . Thames Hub insist it offers a splendid solution. But they have yet to convince everyone, especially people living in the area. Councillor Rodney Chambers, leader of . Medway Council in Kent, said: ‘The Isle of Grain is home to one of the . world’s largest liquefied natural gas terminals, with a fifth of the . UK’s gas supply offloaded by container ships and stored there. ‘We have looked at Lord Foster’s plan . and he appears to want to place his fantasy Isle of Grain airport on . top of the LNG plant and a power station. It beggars belief.’ Lord Foster said: ‘We need to . recapture the foresight and political courage of our 19th century . forebears if we are to establish a modern transport and energy . infrastructure in Britain for this century and beyond. We can do it . here.’ The airport’s backers claim that if . the Government supports the scheme, sovereign wealth funds and wealthy . foreign investors will stump up the cash to make it a reality. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, . yesterday declared his support for the plans, despite them rivalling his . own vision for a ‘floating’ airport in the Thames Estuary. A spokesman said: ‘He is delighted . that a distinguished figure like Lord Foster agrees that the answer to . Britain’s aviation needs lie in the [Thames] estuary.’ Huge: Foster and Partners artist impression of the Thames Hub, a four-runway Thames Estuary airport capable of handling 150 million passengers a year . Danger: Medway Council say mixing the Liquefied Natural Gas import facility on the Isle of Grain, pictured, with a new airport would be a recipe for disaster . Lethal: The liquid gas for the area comes via the container port at the Isle of Grain, which protesters also say makes the area the wrong choice for an airport .","Rival to Mayor's 'Boris Island' plan, it would run 24 hours a day and be more than twice as busy as Heathrow .
A railway station to be built under the new airport would be the UK's busiest, handling 300,000 arrivals and departures a day .
Critics say nearby gas storage and container port mean it is the 'daftest ever' airport plan for the area as results of a crash would be explosive .

"Rainbow loom bands have assumed a universal appeal far beyond the wildest dreams of the craze’s creator, Malaysia-born Cheong Choon Ng, 45. Four years ago Ng was trying to make rubber-band bracelets with his daughters Teresa, now 16, and Michelle, 13, when he realized his fingers were too big to manipulate the bands. So, the automotive crash-test engineer set about creating a tool that would help him do the job. He made a small loom with pins stuck in a piece of wood so he could play along, too. Scroll down for video . Celebrities including Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Pope Francis, right, have been photographed wearing the rubber-band bracelets in public and have helped the craze to grow . The travel-size Finger Loom, which comes out on Wednesday, is a new product which Ng hopes will sustain his business' incredible growth . Inspired by his ad-hoc creation, Ng, an engineer, developed a plastic version and patented it, spending $10,000 of the family’s savings to get it made cheaply in China. By summer 2011, he was selling kits for $15 (£10) under the name of Rainbow Loom. Each comprised a small plastic loom - measuring 2in by 8in - a crochet hook and 600 multi-colored mini-rubber bands. But many toy shops were unwilling to stock them. Ng didn’t find his first customer until the summer of 2012 when an American franchise called Learning Express Toys ordered 24 looms. They sold out within two days and his business took off. Headquartered in an industrial park in Wixom, Michigan, Ng's company, called Choon's Design, has since sold over 8 million units worldwide and 40 million packs of rubber bands. Ng’s company is now worth more than $130 million. Rainbow loom bands have assumed a universal appeal far beyond the wildest dreams of the craze’s creator, Malaysia-born Cheong Choon Ng, 45 . When the Duchess of Cambridge was pictured in April wearing a red and pink bracelet given to her by a young girl during the royal tour of Australia, sales soared by 300 per cent. Prince William even accessorized his smart navy suit with a turquoise and black version in June. Other famous people photographed wearing the bands include David Beckham, One Direction's Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus and even The Pope. But Ng is aware the toy business is fickle and that the popularity of the Rainbow Loom could fade. That's why he's introducing new products, such as the travel-size Finger Loom, which comes out on Wednesday. He's also fine-tuning the original and trying to drum up interest overseas with plans for expansion in Germany and Japan. In addition to jewelry, loom bands can be used to create various accessories and toys, including key rings, phone cases and even shoes. Anna Protherough, senior buyer for children at Hobbycraft said: 'The loom bands are an absolute phenomenon. 'We began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one, they have been flying off our shelves.' However, in light of the craze, medical professionals have raised concerns about the safety of the bands. It comes after a number of children were harmed playing with genuine loom bands, including one boy who nearly lost two fingers after the bands wrapped tightly around them and another who was left blinded when one hit him in the eye. Headquartered in an industrial park in Wixom, Michigan, Ng's company, called Choon's Design, has sold over 8 million units worldwide and 40 million packs of rubber bands . While genuine loom bands contain acceptable levels of phthalates – which is 0.1 per cent by weight in the UK and U.S – several counterfeit products, predominantly charms to attach to the bands, have emerged with far higher levels of the chemicals. Tests by the Assay Office in Birmingham found some batches of charms heading for British shelves contained as much as 50 per cent of phthalates. The rise of counterfeits has even prompted Rainbow Looms to issue a warning about fake products. The firm which started the craze said: Tthere are many fake/counterfeit Rainbow Loom products available online and at stores. 'Some fake products possess the same name as genuine Rainbow Loom products but these counterfeit products are unsafe for children and have not been tested in accordance with U.S. Toy Safety Standards (may contain lead and other dangerous substances).' It also warned that products could be of inferior in quality.","Cheong Choon Ng developed the concept of loom bands while playing with his daughters .

"British football fans will still be able to watch Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard when they head to America after Sky Sports won the exclusive rights to broadcast live Major League Soccer from the start of this season. Sky have signed a four-year deal to show exclusively live games from the MLS from March when the season kicks off. Former England internationals Gerrard and Lampard  join the league in July once they have finished playing in the Premier League. Robbie Keane lifts the MLS trophy for LA Galaxy after beating New England Revolution in the final . To give you an idea of when the MLS clashes take place, here are kick-off times for the opening round of fixtures in the 2015 season. All times are UK. Saturday March 7 . LA Galaxy vs Chicago Fire 3am . DC United vs Montreal Impact 8pm . Philadelphia Union vs Colorado Rapids 9pm . Whitecaps FC vs Toronto FC 11pm . Sunday March 8 . FC Dallas vs SJ Earthquakes 1.30am . Houston Dynamo vs Columbus Crew 1.30am . Portland Timbers vs Real Salt Lake 3.30am . Orlando City vs New York City 9pm . Sporting KC vs New York Red Bulls 11pm . Monday March 9 . Sounders FC vs NE Revolution 1.30am . Gerrard will link up with former Liverpool team-mate Robbie Keane at defending MLS champions LA Galaxy and Lampard will team up with David Villa at New York City for their inaugural season in the league. David Beckham, who played for LA Galaxy, welcomed the news, saying: ‘This is another important moment that shows the continued growth of MLS. ‘I have seen first-hand how popular soccer has become in America. Having fantastic partners such as Sky Sports on board will not only add to the coverage of the game, it will also broaden its appeal outside of the US.’ While Sky Sports pundit and former New York Red Bulls striker Thierry Henry said: ‘I will never forget my time playing in MLS - it gave me some great memories and I was proud to play a role in growing the game. ‘I saw the passion of the fans in the US. They have always had it for other sports but they also have it for football now and it’s going to be huge in years to come. Sky Sports is the best place for the game, to bring it closer to fans in the UK and build MLS even more.’ Frank Lampard will join new New York City in their debut season in MLS . Bradley Wright-Phillips was the top scorer in MLS last season for New York Red Bulls . Sky Sports managing director Barney Francis said: ‘Football in the US and Canada has enormous potential for growth and we can’t wait to bring this competition to our viewers for the first time. Thierry Henry has joined us, he created fantastic memories in MLS, and we look forward to seeing more of those great stories from across the Atlantic.’ Sky recently paid £4.2billion for the right to broadcast 126 live Premier League matches per season from 2016 on a three-year deal. Kaka - Orlando City SC . The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard – New York City FC . One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City. Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy . The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane. David Villa - New York City FC . Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season. Bradley Wright Phillips - New York Red Bulls . Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.","Sky Sports sign four-year deal to show MLS games .

"Professor Christian Dustmann co-authored a study which claimed that EU immigration has boosted public finances by £20billion . The academic who predicted that only 13,000 Eastern Europeans would arrive in Britain each year was under fresh fire last night for his latest study which claimed that EU immigration has boosted public finances by £20billion. Ministers said the new report co-written by Professor Christian Dustmann had taken a ‘very narrow focus’ which ignored the physical pressure migrants place on schools, hospitals and roads. Yesterday, the Mail reported how Professor Dustmann and Dr Tommaso Frattini, of University College London, had produced a report heralding the ‘positive economic impact’ of new arrivals from the EU between 2001 and 2011. The academics put particular emphasis on the fact that Eastern European workers had contributed £5billion more in taxes than they had consumed in public services and state handouts. But, amid criticism of the fact the report did not include the potential future costs associated with the EU migrants growing older and using more State services, critics pointed to Professor Dustmann’s past history. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch, said: ‘It is possible that Professor Dustmann’s enthusiasm is not entirely unrelated to the fact that he was a lead researcher on the 2003 Home Office paper which calculated that immigration from Eastern Europe would be between 5,000 and 13,000 a year.’ In the event, more than one million workers from Eastern Europe arrived between 2004 and the end of 2009 – an average of around 200,000 a year. The study carried out by the academic for the Home Office has been widely ridiculed by politicians as ‘spectacularly wrong’ and ‘laughable’. In the new report, EU migrants were said to have contributed a net £20billion to the public finances – including £15billion from the so-called old EU, which includes France and Germany. Immigration minister James Brokenshire said the report had taken ‘a very narrow focus’. He told the Mail: ‘This is a complex topic and when it comes to EU migration this report does not take proper account of the pressures uncontrolled, mass immigration – the kind we saw under the last government – places on public services and communities. ‘It ignores issues that matter to hardworking people, the impact on schools, on hospitals, on roads, on housing. It tells us nothing about how uncontrolled, mass immigration can make it harder to maintain social cohesion.The report takes no account of the future costs associated with those who stay, grow old and make greater demands on our public services.’ Ukip’s migration spokesman Steven Woolfe MEP said the study covers ‘only a narrow part of the UK migration policy debate’. Professor Dustmann has defended his 2003 report predicting up to 13,000 arrivals a year from Eastern Europe as he made clear immigration would be much higher if, as happened, other countries decided to curb access . He added: ‘What it doesn’t do is to show what wealth our own people could have generated if they weren’t subjected to wage-reducing, employment-displacing mass immigration from the EU. Sir Andrew Green said: ‘If you take all EU migration, including those who arrived before 2001, you find by the end of the period they are making a negative contribution and increasingly so. ‘And the reason is that if you take a group of people while they’re young fit and healthy they’re not going to be very expensive, but if you take them over a longer period they will be.’ While the UCL focussed on new arrivals from within the EU, buried inside the 51-page report was a calculation showing that, if the time period 1995-2001 is considered, non-European migrants living in Britain took out more than they put in for 17 consecutive years. The total cost to the public finances was almost £118billion. Professor Dustmann has defended his 2003 report predicting up to 13,000 arrivals a year from Eastern Europe. He said it made clear immigration would be much higher if, as happened, Germany and other countries decided to curb access to their labour markets. Analysis: True picture his figures do not reveal . European immigrants who have arrived in the UK since 2000 contributed more than £20billion to the UK public finances between 2001 and 2008 . What does the report claim? The headline-finding of Professor Christian Dustmann and Dr Tommaso Frattini, of UCL’s Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration, is that European immigrants who have arrived in the UK since 2000 contributed more than £20billion to the UK public finances between 2001 and 20011. The pair are particularly keen to emphasise the fact that Eastern European workers put in 12 per cent more in taxes than they received in State services and handouts. Were Eastern Europeans the major EU contributors to the Exchequer? No. They provided only a quarter of the positive contributions – despite more than one million people coming from the former Eastern Bloc since our borders were opened in 2004. Some £15billion of the total came from the 15 members of the so-called old EU. It includes the vast sums contributed by bankers, engineers and IT experts from countries such as France, Germany and Holland. In practical terms, what does it all mean? Migrationwatch says the £20billion figure is the equivalent of a positive contribution of less than £1 a week per head of the total British population. For Eastern European workers, this figure falls to around 20p a week. The crucial question is: is this a price worth paying for the fact that, since 2000, more than a million EU migrants have been added to the population – placing significant strain on the country’s social fabric. Does report assess impact of migration from outside the EU? Yes – and it makes for far less positive reading. Between 1995 and 2011, non-European migrants living in the UK cost the public finances almost £118billion – taking out more in services and benefits than they paid in taxes for 17 consecutive years. During the same period, EU migrants made a net contribution of £4.425billion. British natives were a net drain on the nation’s finances of £541billion – reflecting the fact the country has been running a significant deficit in recent years. Why such a gap between EU and non-EU migrant contributions? Many of the non-European migrants arrived during previous waves of immigration. They now have families and are making significant demands on schools, hospitals and the welfare state. The Eastern European migrants, by contrast, are typically young and single. EU migrants also have far higher employment rates. For example, 81.2 per cent of Poles are in work compared to 46 per cent of those from Pakistan. Does the report measure the financial cost of the strain on Britain’s public services? Calculations have been made to establish how much migrants cost in terms of government funds, such as medical expenses, schooling their children and the welfare state. The total was then deducted from their overall contribution to the public purse, including income tax, National Insurance, VAT, council tax and business rates. So what are the key omissions? First, the scope of the report is too narrow – focussing on the cost of using public services but not the physical pressure put on roads, schools and hospitals by having to cope with so many new arrivals. Also, the report only looks backwards. It examines the taxes paid by the influx of Eastern Europeans when they are young, single and healthy but does not estimate the financial impact of them growing older and having families, putting a greater strain on the NHS and possibly claiming a State pension. Is there any acknowledgement of this fact in the report? Tucked away on p37, there is a paragraph which states that ‘ageing of the immigrant population that arrived since 2000 may lead in the longer run to an increase in benefit receipt’. However, the authors assert this will be offset by the fact some migrants will return home, while others are yet to achieve their full economic potential. What about the impact of mass immigration on British workers? The study makes no attempt to measure this. The independent Migration Advisory Committee warned earlier this year that cheap foreign labour has forced down the wages of some British workers. One study of pay in London had found the 20 per cent lowest paid had seen wages fall by 15 per cent on average. Driving down the wage of natives pushes up the overall welfare bill since they are likely to be paid more in tax credits and other handouts to compensate. And the effect on British school-leavers? The report makes great play of the fact that immigrants have ‘endowed the UK labour market with human capital that would have cost about £49billion if it were produced through the UK education system’. However, as David Green of the Civitas think-tank points out, the arrival of well-educated young migrants coincided with a slump in apprenticeships for UK teenagers – at great social cost. In 2012, the MAC estimated that, for every four migrant workers who come to the country from outside the EU, one British job is lost, again increasing the welfare bill.","Report claims EU immigration has boosted public finances by £20bn .

"If you can hold your breath all the way to the bottom here, you are in a very small minority - this is Y-40 The Deep Joy and with a staggering depth of -40 metres it is the world's deepest pool. The incredible swim centre, designed by renowned architect Emanuele Boaretto, is located within the four-star Hotel Terme Millepini in Montegrotto Terme, Italy. Operating since June, the pool has a diving height of a 12-storey building, or nine double decker buses placed on top of each other. Wet suits aren't required here as swimmers can enjoy a regular temperature of between 32-34°C. Scroll down for video . Record breaker: Y-40 The Deep Joy is the world's deepest pool with a staggering depth of -40 metres . There are several platforms, ranging from -1.3m, to -12m. The pool at the surface is 21m by 18m but it becomes a narrow well-like hole as the depths plummet straight down. Visitors are able to use the facilities for free diving and scuba diving, with underwater caves for cave diving beginners. There is also a unique suspended underwater tunnel which is entirely transparent, so non-swimmers can experience the pool without getting wet. There is a sunbathing deck with loungers on the roof, where swimmers can recover from their deep-diving experience. Dry dock: The underwater tunnel runs right through the middle of the pool . Plunging: One of the first divers to use the pool is  filmed from the depths of the Y-40 . Overtaken: The Y-40 surpassed the Nemo33 in Brussels, Belgium, which had a maximum depth of 34.5 metres . Afraid of depths? The pool features several depth platforms before narrowing into a deep descent . Activities: As well as free diving, the pool offers opportunities for scuba divers to practice cave diving . Notable figures from Italian water sports helped to launch the facility this year, including Italian free diver Umberto Pelizzari, and Enzo Maiorca, the ‘father’ of freediving in Italy. Freediver Ilaria Molinari even donned a mermaid tail to dive down to 40 metres to wow spectators. 'Y-40 is unique in its field thanks to the spa water, which cannot be outsourced,' says architect Emanuele Boaretto. 'We want to open up new medium and long term work prospects to try and guarantee prosperity, not only for my company but also for the surrounding land and society.' Other-worldly: Free diver Ilaria Molinari dresses as a mermaid to swim through the artificial cave-diving area . Launch: Molinari dove the depths of the pool at its opening with the help of a mermaid's tail . The pool is situated in a regional natural park of the Euganean Hills in Italy. Mr Boaretto is planning to cover the pool with lawn to b;lend the structure into its environment. Y-40 is open all year round and offers the equivalent of diving the height of a 12-storey building. Activities at the pool include scuba diving, free diving, aqua fitness, watsu, hydro-kinesi therapy and special activities for pregnant women. The four-star hotel within the region of Villa Duodo boasts 100 air-conditioned rooms. Spectator sport: A 13-metre transparent tunnel allows non-swimmers to experience the pool . Temperate: 4,300 cubic metres of thermal water are kept at a temperature of 32-34 degrees celcius . Nemo 33 in Brussels, Belgium, was the deepest indoor swimming pool in the world before Y-40 was completed. Its maximum depth is 34.5 metres (113 ft) and it contains 2,500,000 litres of non-chlorinated, highly filtered spring water maintained at 30C. The pool also holds several simulated underwater caves at the 10 metres depth level. Due to the warm temperature in the pool, divers can dive for extended periods without a wet suit. It was designed by a Belgian diving expert, John Beernaerts, and is used for recreation, scuba diving practice and instruction and by film-makers and scientists. Architectural marvel: The pool is designed by renowned architect Emanuele Boaretto . The world’s largest swimming pool, completed in 2006, is located at the San Alfonso del Mar resort in Algarrobo, Chile. It is estimated to have cost more than £613million to construct and covers nearly 20 acres. Swimming a length in this would mean stroke after stroke for more than three fifths of a mile - that's 20 Olympic-size swimming pools. The enormous man-made lagoon is set halfway up the country's Pacific coast and is filled with 66 million gallons of crystal clear seawater. It uses a computer-controlled suction and filtration system to suck water in from the ocean at one end and pump it out at the other, while the sun warms it to 26C - nine degrees higher than the sea.

"It's the scene of some of the most crucial developments in British history, where RAF commanders masterminded the defeat of the Nazis during the Battle of Britain. The bunker was home to the division of Fighter Command responsible for striking down the enemy between July and September, 1940, after Hitler launched his campaign for superiority over the British air forces. Known as the Battle of Britain bunker, the base in Uxbridge, west London, is now open to the public, offering visitors a rare glimpse into the Britain's wartime past with its restored operations room and accompanying museum.

The operations room has been restored to depict what life was like for members of the No 11 Group who worked from the bunker in west London . Equipment in the Flight Operations room which has been restored to offer visitors a rare glimpse into how British forces defeated the Nazis .

The operations room has been fully restored to offer visitors an insight into British wartime history while original features like the ventilation system still work . The base, which saw most action because of its location in the south east of England, was the inspiration for Winston Churchill's famous wartime speech which began: 'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed, by so many, to so few'. The Battle of Britain began after German forces successfully invaded France in May 1940, and was Hitler's attempt to gain superiority over the RAF. It was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces and was the largest and most sustained series of aerial bombings at the time. Germany's failure to destroy British air defences is considered its first major defeat, and a crucial turning point in WWII. The battle was fought in four stages, the first being a series of running fights over the English channel followed by a string of raids on RAF bases which was given the name 'Adlerangriff' or 'Eagle Attack'. On August 24 the Luftwaffe targeted British airfields but the RAF prevailed. After German Air Forces bombed various British towns and cities, Hitler conceded inferiority to British air defences and postponed Operation Sealion, his planned invasion. The bunker was the centre for No 11 Group who fought off more than two-thirds of the Luftwaffe during the battle which spanned almost three months . Steel pipes and wires run through the restored bunker in Uxbridge which will reopen next year after closing at the end of the month .

The restored operations room and museum allows visitors an insight into one of the most crucial stages in British history. Curator Daniel Stirland said: 'We have had about 100 people on average each weekend day, to add to those who visit by appointment during the week. 'They come from all over the UK and abroad. The trial has gone very well and we are almost certainly going to do it again next year as well.' Following a visit to the RAF Uxbridge bunker on August 16, 1940, Winston Churchill uttered the famous words: 'Never was so much owed, by so many, to so few'. Days later they set the tone for one of his most distinctive wartime speeches at the House of Commons. Winston Churchill delivered the famous speech on August 20, 1940 after a visit to RAF Uxbridge bunker . 'The whole Island bristles against invaders, from the sea or from the air. …the stronger our Army at home, the larger must the invading expedition be, and the larger the invading expedition, the less difficult will be the task of the Navy in detecting its assembly and in intercepting and destroying it in passage; and the greater also would be the difficulty of feeding and supplying the invaders if ever they landed' 'Why do I say all this? Not, assuredly, to boast; not, assuredly, to give the slightest countenance to complacency. The dangers we face are still enormous, but so are our advantages and resources. I recount them because the people have a right to know that there are solid grounds for the confidence which we feel, and that we have good reason to believe ourselves capable, as I said in a very dark hour two months ago, of continuing the war ""if necessary alone, if necessary for years.""' 'The gratitude of every home in our Island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the World War by their prowess and by their devotion. 'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. All hearts go out to the fighter pilots, whose brilliant actions we see with our own eyes day after day, but we must never forget that all the time, night after night, month after month, our bomber squadrons travel far into Germany, find their targets in the darkness by the highest navigational skill, aim their attacks, often under the heaviest fire, often with serious loss,with deliberate, careful discrimination, and inflict shattering blows upon the whole of the technical and war-making structure of the Nazi power.'","Bunker at RAF Uxbridge was base of No 11 Group who fought off two thirds of Nazi aircraft during three-month long battle .

"Piri Weepu may be a World Cup-winning All Black with an international pedigree but arguably his greatest achievement is simply being alive to tell the tale. In February, the 71-times capped scrum-half, 31, who will make his Aviva Premiership debut on Sunday for London Welsh against Exeter, was taking part in a routine recovery session in the swimming pool for his former Super Rugby side the Blues when disaster struck. ‘Me, Charles Piutau and Peter Saili were in the water doing lengths for recovery, stretching and whatnot,’ said Weepu, speaking for the first time about the stroke which almost cost him his life. Death-defying: World Cup-winning New Zealander Piri Weepu reveals to Sportsmail how he survived a stroke . All Black back: Weepu, 31, makes his debut for London Welsh on Sunday as club returns to the Premiership . ‘I went to explain something to them and found myself talking like a kid, a baby really. I couldn’t say any words. Nothing. ‘I got frustrated. I felt like an idiot. I got out of the pool and went to get dressed but I couldn’t hear anything. All I could concentrate on was what was happening directly in front of me. A few of the boys were trying to chat away to me but I couldn’t understand what they were saying. Confused:  Auckland's Weepu thought he was suffering from the effects of a concussion during the stroke but it was a hole in his heart, doctors found . ‘I had a bit of blurred vision and scarily I actually drove home. It was probably only a kilometre and a half so I drove as slowly as possible. I stopped if I needed to. I kept checking my eyes to see if it was something I had done in the pool. ‘I remember texting the team doctor to ask for help. But I didn’t know what I was doing or even how to use my phone properly to send the text. I got home and decided to wait it out a bit and see what happened before ringing the doc to work out what to do. I chilled out for about half an hour and started packing my bag before ringing the doctor to find out what was going on. It was a pretty scary not knowing what it was.’ Initially Weepu put the symptoms down to a concussion suffered in a previous game. But tests revealed he had suffered a stroke after blood was prevented from reaching his brain by a previously undiagnosed heart condition. ‘I had a hole in my heart and they’re putting the stroke down to that,’ he said. ‘At the time I thought it may have been a delayed concussion type of injury. But once I’d had all the scans we realised it was to do with the heart.’ Weepu required surgery to block the hole and now, seven months later, he says he is ready to resurrect his career after becoming one of the Premiership’s few high-profile summer signings. But surely such a dramatic health scare called him to question his chosen profession? Highlight: Weepu (right) poses with the World Cup's Webb Ellis Cup with All Blacks team-mate Ma'a Nonu . ‘Not at all,’ he said. ‘I would have done anything possible to get back on a rugby field. The only I way I would have hung up the boots would have been if I’d broken my leg again. I’d probably stay out on the field even if I was crawling. I tell my coaches all the time, “Don’t take me off unless I’m out on a stretcher”. ‘All I wanted to know after the stroke was what the procedures were and what I needed to do to get back out on the pitch. I don’t really know the background that caused me to have it. I’ve just been trying to make the most of life in general. It’s not easy to bounce back. It’s in the back of your head that something like that could happen again. ‘I’ve seen it [the stroke] as another opportunity at life and trying to make the most of it. That’s the whole reason I came to the UK. This opportunity may not have come around this year or the year after. I’ve been playing Super Rugby for the last 11 seasons so it will be good to see what the Premiership is all about.’ On Sunday he will find out, partnering former England three-quarter Olly Barkley at half-back, as Justin Burnell’s hastily assembled squad attempt to give the Exiles the perfect start to the season against Rob Baxter’s Chiefs. Weepu, who kicked the All Blacks to the World Cup final in 2011, will do so convinced he is ready to resume his career. He is content and ready for the next step in a rugby career that almost ended in that Auckland pool. ‘It’s early days but I’m enjoying life here,’ he said. ‘It’s good to be able to walk down the street and not be yelled at and expected to react like we are back home. I don’t mind it. But if you want to get my attention then just approach me rather than try to yell for my attention. ‘I’ve got no dramas with that. I might be a World Cup winner but people should just say ‘hello’. I’m not going to bite them.’ He is more concerned with taking a second bite at life.

"All the best school science experiments carry at least a hint of danger. But when 13-year-old Jamie Edwards informed his stunned headmaster of his plan to build a nuclear reactor in a classroom, the obvious question was: ‘Will it blow the school up?’ Fortunately, in a victory for the spirit of amateur scientific discovery over the health and safety culture, Jamie’s promise that it was perfectly safe was believed. 13-year-old Jamie Edwards has become the youngest in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor . And yesterday he became the youngest . person in the world to achieve nuclear fusion from scratch at his . Lancashire secondary school, using high energy to smash two hydrogen . atoms together to make helium. ‘It . is quite an achievement. It’s magnificent really,’ Jamie said . afterwards. ‘I can’t quite believe it – even though all my friends think . I am mad.’ Jamie, who . attends Penwortham Priory Academy near Preston, has been fascinated with . radiation for years, on one occasion even buying a Geiger counter with . his Christmas money. His . fusion ambition was sparked by reading about a 14-year-old US schoolboy, . Taylor Wilson, who had become the youngest to produce a small fusion . reactor in Nevada in 2008. ‘I looked at it, thought “That looks cool” and decided to have a go,’ Jamie added. Head teacher Jim Hourigan congratulates Jamie as a Geiger counter registers the fusion reaction . Jamie Edwards (pictured) built the reactor from scratch in a bid to be younger than American Taylor Wilson who completed a reactor aged 14 in 2008 . Jamie's first step was to enlist help from nuclear laboratories and university . departments, but ‘they didn’t seem to take me seriously’. Nuclear fusion is one of the most promising options for generating large amounts of carbon-free energy in the future. To get energy from fusion, gas from a combination of types of hydrogen – deuterium and tritium – is heated to very high temperatures (100 million °C). One way to achieve these conditions is a method called ‘magnetic confinement' – controlling the hot gas with strong magnets. Jamie Edwards was inspired by Taylor Wilson's technique which used something known as 'Inertial Electrostatic Confinement.' This method uses electric fields to do the work on charged particles - either ions or electrons - allowing them to be heated to fusion conditions. So . that left the laboratories at his school, and the task of convincing . headmaster Jim Hourigan. Fortunately the head agreed, coming up with the . necessary £3,000 funding. ‘I . was a bit stunned and I have to say a little nervous when Jamie . suggested this but he reassured me he wouldn’t blow the school up,’ Mr . Hourigan said yesterday. After months of work, the reactor was finally completed just ahead of his 14th birthday this weekend. And . yesterday, in a ‘radiation controlled area’ in a classroom, before an . audience of experts, he flicked a switch and stared intently at his . Geiger counter until it registered that fusion had indeed taken place – . or created ‘a star in a jar’, as Jamie refers to it. Nuclear . fusion, the reaction that powers the sun, is very different from . nuclear fission, or the splitting of the atom, that occurs in nuclear . power stations and is the stuff of atom bombs. However, both release vast amounts of energy. Jamie started building the reactor in October at the science laboratory at Priory Academy, Lancashire, and finally finished the task this morning . In an incredible eureka moment head teacher Jim Hourigan can be seen pointing to the experiment as a Geiger counter registers Jamie's fusion reaction has taken place .

"The pageantry and pomp of Britain's biggest ceremonial events could be diluted because of cuts to the Armed Forces, a senior officer has warned. Garrison Sergeant Major Bill Mott, who has overseen occasions including the royal wedding, Baroness Thatcher's funeral and Trooping the Colour, said massive redundancies meant he was struggling to 'produce the same spectacle'. The events, which showcase the magnificent sight of Britain's military personnel, are renowned across the world. Garrison Sergeant Major Bill Mott said massive redundancies meant he was struggling create the same military pomp to occasions such as the Royal Wedding (pictured) But GSM Mott, who has been in post for 12 years, fears the traditions could be undermined as the Coalition reduces the size of the Army from 102,000 to 82,000. His comments are likely to prove especially sensitive as Prince Harry is now a staff officer in the same district as GSM Mott after completing his attachment co-piloting Apache attack helicopters with the Army Air Corps. GSM Mott told Defence Focus, an internal Ministry of Defence magazine, that soldiers are 'gritting their teeth and getting on with it' in the face of the cuts. He said: 'As we condense we have to conform to various restraints, and it becomes more and more difficult to still produce the same spectacle.' GSM Mott, one of the last remaining Falklands veterans still serving, led the pallbearers who carried Baroness Thatcher on her final journey to St Paul's Cathedral. He and his brother Major Nick Mott, who also carried the coffin, were aboard the Sir Galahad on June 8, 1982, when it came under fire from Argentine warplanes. GSM Mott Mott has been in the role for 12 years and oversaw Baroness Thatcher's funeral last year (pictured) The attack cost the lives of 48 personnel, including 32 from the Welsh Guards, and left 150 Welsh guardsmen injured, including Simon Weston. GSM Mott took up the post in 2002, and is one of the most senior non–commissioned officers in the British Army. In his role, he is responsible for all ceremonial events in London, from providing guards of honour to orchestrating major occasions such as state visits, the State Opening of Parliament and the Queen's Birthday Parade. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said ceremonial duties remained an 'important part' of the Armed Forces but the 'priority' was ensuring Britain had an 'effective fighting force'.","Garrison Sergeant Major Bill Mott overseen events such as royal wedding .

"Demands: Prosecutors want captain coward Francesco Schettino jailed for a total of 2,697 years as they made a request to have him sent back to jail . Prosecutors want 'Captain Coward' Francesco Schettino jailed for a total of 2,697 years as they made a request to have him sent back to jail, it emerged today. Schettino, 52, is currently under house arrest while investigators consider charges of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship following the Costa Concordia liner disaster last month. Seventeen lost their lives and at least 17 are still missing after the skipper recklessly changed course and crashed the 114,000-ton liner onto rocks just so that he could carry out a 'sail by' salute and impress crew and friends. Prosecutors say that the spineless captain then abandoned ship, leaving hundreds of people still onboard, while he reached the safety of dry land on the nearby island of Giglio in a lifeboat. Last month an investigating judge granted Schettino house arrest and he is currently serving that at his home in Meta di Sorrento near Naples, which he shares with his wife Fabiola and teenage daughter. Today, in a three hour closed door hearing in Florence before an appeal court judge, prosecutors argued he be sent back to jail as they fear he may well interfere with evidence and the fact that he fled his ship also raises the possibility he may try and avoid justice. Lead investigator Francesco Verusio is looking for Schettino to be given 15 years for multiple manslaughter, ten years for causing a disaster and eight years for every passenger that was abandoned and the same sentence for those that died, with all terms running consecutively. That makes a grand total of 2,697 years, as 34 people are believed to have been killed and 300 passengers were abandoned by Schettino the night of the disaster on January 13. Prosecutors outlined their demands in a 12 page document handed to judges as they presented their request to have him sent back to jail, while his lawyers argued he should be released. Listing: The Costa Concordia is almost entirely on its side, as it continues to slip from its rocky resting place . Devastation: The ship continues to lie in the water . His legal team pointed to the fact that Schettino had been suspended from his post by the Concordia's owners Costa Cruises following the disaster. And they added that the incident was 'unique and unrepeatable' proof they said he would not flee justice and tamper with evidence. However, Mr Verusio said Schettino's reaction when he was originally informed he was being placed under investigation and taken to jail underlined the fact he could try and escape. He said: 'When first told he was going to jail, Schettino asked if he could go to a hotel first and then for something to eat. He also has the possibility of escaping to various places across the world.' The hearing adjourned its decision until Friday. Dropping in: Italian firefighters were lowered from a helicopter onto the ship last month as they desperately looked for bodies . Wreck: Divers ended their search of the ship as it became too dangerous for them to look for bodies . Meanwhile newspaper adverts were also published today inviting 4,200 passengers and crew who were on the Concordia to attend a preliminary hearing in Grosseto on March 3. Twenty three British holidaymakers were on the Concordia but they are not under any legal obligation to attend the hearing which will take place in the town's theatre as the court building is too small. Costa have already offered compensation of £9,000 to each holidaymaker affected but many have said they will not accept and instead pursue court action for a higher payout. Bad weather around Giglio has led to the search for victims to be suspended and it had also delayed the removal of 500,000 gallons of heavy duty diesel from the Concordia's tanks. Delay: Salvage workers had to halt operations on the removal of fuel from the tanks of the half-sunken Costa Concordia cruise ship due to bad weather and rough seas earlier this month .

"Nathan Hughes may be wrestling with a three-way quandary over national allegiance but there is no doubting his commitment to Wasps, as his wife would confirm. On the night of his wedding to Ella, back home in Lautoka, Fiji, the 23-year-old No 8 wound up in a pub watching his team-mates in action — thousands of miles and many time zones away. It may not have made sense to his bride but Hughes was determined to watch the club that had ignited his career claim their place in the inaugural European Champions Cup. He had been given special dispensation to miss the tie against Stade Francais in Paris last May because of his need to be on the far side of the world. ‘Before the fixtures came out, we had planned the date for the wedding,’ said Hughes. Nathan Hughes proved his dedication to the club by spending his wedding night watching Wasps play . ‘When Dai (Young, Wasps’ director of rugby) said we had a game on May 24, I was a bit nervous about going to ask him if I could miss it. ‘I delayed the flight to Fiji so I could play in the first game, then I went out after that. I watched the second game on TV, after the wedding. It was about 3am in Fiji, so I put my missus to bed and said, “I’m going to the pub to watch the boys play”. She asked why I didn’t just watch the replay but I said, “I can’t, I have to see it now”. It was the game which decided whether we made it into Europe (Champions Cup) or not, so I had to watch it and I was so pleased we won.’ The new elite continental tournament will be a fitting arena for Hughes to demonstrate his explosive talent and enhance a soaring reputation. He is already making waves in the Aviva Premiership, having come to Wasps from Auckland as a relative unknown. The 23-year-old scored a try for Wasps during the season opening defeat to Saracens at Twickenham . Young signed the raw lock-cum-flanker on a hunch, switched him to No 8 and soon found he had a barnstorming replacement for Billy Vunipola, who had moved to Saracens. Hughes has been a potent threat to opposition defences with his ball-carrying, off-loading, try-scoring routine, as he demonstrated last Saturday by touching down during a sensational performance at Twickenham. Yet hockey was his childhood sport and, remarkably, he did not play in a rugby match until six years ago. When he gave it a go, the results were immediate. ‘I started playing hockey aged five and switched to rugby when I was 17,’ said Hughes. ‘At my school in Fiji, we were doing hockey training one day and the rugby coach asked if I wanted to play against a team coming from New Zealand because he didn’t have any locks. The Fijian born no 8 impressed during his debut season in the Aviva Premiership for Wasps last year . ‘I said I didn’t know any rules and all he said was, “Catch the ball, run it straight and if you see an opposition player with the ball, tackle him”. The week after, we played against the school from New Zealand — Kelston. Kelston sent some scouts out and they were impressed with the way I played. ‘That was my first-ever game of rugby. After the game, our coach called me over and the guy (scout) from New Zealand gave me an envelope. When I went home, I opened the envelope and it said, “2010 scholarship for Kelston Boy’s School”. I told my dad and he just said, “You don’t even play rugby”. But I showed him all the papers they gave me and he was so surprised.’ One game had brought one big breakthrough and Hughes continued to make rapid progress, from the Kelston 1st XV into the Auckland academy and on into the senior squad to play in the domestic ITM Cup. He was also called up for the New Zealand Sevens squad but held off from accepting while he awaited a Super 15 contract. That next step up eluded him, so despite being eligible to chase All Blacks selection after three years’ residency, he explored options abroad and Wasps took a chance on him. His impact has been so eye-catching that there is now a tussle for his Test services. Fiji and Samoa see him as a potential asset at next year’s World Cup and England are monitoring his development. Hughes is eligible to play for Fiji, Samoa and could turn out for England in two years time . Hughes will qualify to wear the Red Rose in 2016 and while he is non-committal for now, it seems he is leaning towards that target. ‘People have been saying, “I think Fiji want you, I think Samoa want you”,’ he said. ‘But they haven’t approached me face to face. The Fiji coach did call to ask if I wanted to play in the summer but I said I couldn’t because I was getting married. ‘My mum is Samoan-Chinese and my dad is part Samoan, part Fijian, so I am majority Samoan but I was born in Fiji and grew up there. I love both countries but it’s about taking my time to make the right decision. ‘I don’t want to make a decision and then regret it later. There are two options and once I qualify (for England) on residency, there will be three. I haven’t heard from England but, if they want me, I have to keep working on my game.’ On Sunday afternoon at Adams Park, Hughes has a prime opportunity to highlight his Test credentials when Wasps face champions Northampton and their outstanding No 8, Samu Manoa. The American is from a Tongan family, with body art depicting their journey to San Francisco. Hughes is also proud of his Polynesian heritage and wears the ink to prove it, along with a wedding tattoo. ‘The one on the right arm, which goes to my back, is a map of Fiji, to show where I come from,’ he said. ‘On my left arm, the turtle symbolises myself and where I’m from. The tulip is the Dutch flower, so it symbolises my wife — who was born in New Zealand, but her family are Dutch. The design on the left represents the wedding. Most people have a wedding ring but I’ve got a wedding tattoo instead.’","23-year-old Wasps number 8 signed for the Londoners in 2013 .

"Letters exchanged between Hewitt, then General Secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties, and Keith Hose, the chairman of PIE were discovered . Further evidence of the link between a civil liberties organisation and a child sex lobbying group emerged last night, as letters between Patricia Hewitt and the Paedophile Information Exchange were discovered. The letters between former Cabinet health minister Hewitt, then General Secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties, and Keith Hose, the chairman of PIE were discovered in an archive at Hull University. In December 1975, Hose wrote to Hewitt asking her to consider PIE's views in its policy on the age of consent, which included decriminalising sex with children as young as four. His letter was written on PIE notepaper and the letterhead featured a logo of two barelegged children sitting on a rock. The letter from the PIE chairman said: 'As a member of the NCCL Gay Rights Sub-Committee it has come to my notice that the next meeting of the NCCL Executive Committee is to consider NCCL policy in relation to ""Ages of Consent"" for sexual activity. 'Paedophile Information Exchange has produced some evidence for the Criminal Law Revision Committee on this subject and I have enclosed two copies with this letter in the hope that the ideas contained in our evidence might help the NCCL Executive Committee reach a decision.' Hewitt responded to Mr Hose, in a typed letter on yellow paper seen by The Guardian: 'Thank you for your letter of 16th December. My apologies for the delay in acknowledging. 'We have found your evidence... most helpful and I think it has certainly been taken into account by the people preparing our evidence.' The autumn 1982 edition of Rights, the in-house magazine of the NCCL. Self-confessed paedophile Mike Morten's letter was published on page 9 (pictured centre) Letter exchange: Patricia Hewitt seen in 1975 on the BBC while she was working for the National Council for Civil Liberties . The archive includes a NCCL briefing note that argues that child pornography should not be outlawed in the 1978 child protection bill, the Guardian reported. It also records how Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman, who started at NCCL in 1978, personally urged changes to the bill that year telling MPs 'images of children should only be considered pornographic if it could be proven the subject suffered'. Miss Harman she said the paedophile group 'had been pushed to the margin' before she began working there . The exchange of letters comes after the Mail can reveal that in 1979, an edition of Magpie, PIE’s official journal, carried the NCCL appeal for new members in an appalling ‘Year of the Child’ edition. The Mail can also reveal that former health minister and NCCL general secretary Patricia Hewitt shared a conference platform with PIE leader Tom O’Carroll in 1977. Ms Harman and her MP husband Jack Dromey say PIE was banished before she became the NCCL’s legal officer in 1978. But disturbing new evidence contradicts this claim – and reveals further embarrassingly close ties between the NCCL and the paedophile group campaigning to legalise sex with children. Miss Harman she said the paedophile group ‘had been pushed to the margin’ before she began working there. Yet, during the year after she took up her post, the NCCL advert appeared in PIE’s April journal.It ran inside a shocking 24-page special edition of the magazine – the cover of which shows a picture of a young boy wearing only a small pair of shorts as he plays tennis. It invites Magpie readers to ‘join the NCCL’ and boasts that the organisation is ‘working to protect and extend human rights in the UK’. The appeal for new members and donations was published after a feature titled: Child porn, a heterosexual viewpoint. Earlier this week Miss Harman  belatedly expressed ‘regret’ – but refused to apologise – for PIE being allowed to forge links with the NCCL . Details of the new links came as O’Carroll claimed the two women ‘didn’t even try’ to remove the paedophile group from the NCCL in case it harmed their careers. The three senior Labour figures all held . key roles in the council – which astonishingly granted ‘affiliate’ status to the group of predatory paedophiles that was calling for the . age of consent to be cut to just four.","Letters exchanged between Patricia Hewitt, then General Secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties, and Keith Hose, PIE's chairman .

"'Glasses-free' 3D has taken another step towards the mainstream, as Toshiba announces a price and release date for the first large set to hit the home. On December 10, Toshiba's REGZA 553X is also capable of '4K' resolutions - four times current hi-def sets. Sadly, the price should ensure the 'naked eye' 3D set doesn't hit the mainstream straight away - it will be £7,400, and only available in Japan. It will launch in the UK early next year, price to be confirmed. It could mark a revolution in 3D televisions - consumers are still lukewarm about the technology, and most surveys indicate that the problem is that people aren't comfortable wearing glasses. Toshiba's 'naked eye' 3D set will be 55 inches, and capable of '4K' resolutions - a super-hi-def format four times the resolutions of current HD sets . The only way to watch Avatar without glasses? Toshiba's 3D sets use hi-tech 'face tracking' technology to aim left-eye and right-eye images at each viewer, using a screen composed of tiny 'lenslets' Unlike previous 'glasses-free' technologies, Toshiba's uses a 'face tracking' system so that each person sees 'perfect' 3D. Earlier 'glasses free' sets, such as ones pioneered by Philips, required you to be sat precisely in front of them to see 3D rather than a weird blur - and even then the effect was jarring and artificial. Toshiba's technology uses high-powered computers in the 'back' of the television to 'aim' separate beams of parallax 3D at each viewer. 'The glasses-free 3D technology is based on the stereoscopic principle of simultaneously delivering a picture for the left eye, and another one with a small offset (parallax), for the right eye to achieve the 3D effect,' says the company. 'To deliver a glasses-free 3D image and experience, a range of lenticular lenslets guide the dedicated images to each viewer.The ZL2 is able to provide 3D images for up to nine different viewing positions, enabling multiple people to enjoy simultaneous 3D viewing, with no glasses required.' The 'lenslets' are tiny lenses that 'focus' the image towards each viewers, using 'face tracking' to ensure each person sees a correct left eye and right eye image. Early tech demos have been highly impressive - and Toshiba is well ahead of rival TV companies in 'naked eye' 3D. Most sets from rivals such as LG are around 25 inches. 'In addition, to tailor the viewing experience to the viewers’ actual positions in front of the TV, the 55ZL2 features face tracking technology. At the touch of a button, it is able to detect the viewers’ position and to adjust the viewing zones accordingly by moving the lenslets as required.' Companies such as Sony are already shooting films in 4K - a super-high-def resolution touted as the 'next generation' of high definition. Toshiba's set is the first consumer TV with the technology - although . there are no video players on the market capable of showing anything in . 4K, or even any discs stored in the format. The TV can also 'upscale' any 2D content into 3D - although it remains to be seen how convincing this function is. Other televisions' attempts to 'upscale' into 3D have looked unconvincing.","Array of tiny lenses 'aims' left eye and right eye images at each viewer .

"With their flat caps and jackets, the crooks in these old mugshots might remind you of the Artful Dodger, the lovable rogue from Oliver Twist. But the Victorian boys and men, pictured in photos from a police archive, did much worse than pick a pocket or two. Harry Fowler, Ernest Bayles, Stephen McHickie and Thomas Gilbert, pictured, were members of the notorious 'Peaky Blinders' gang which terrorised Birmingham around the turn of the 20th century - and now their exploits will be shown in a new BBC drama. Scroll down for video . Left to right, Peaky Blinders Harry Fowler, Ernest Bayles, Stephen McHickie and Thomas Gilbert are revealed in archived police photos . The Peaky Blinders' charge sheets were dug up from the archives of the West Midlands Police museum . The shots were brought out of the archives today by West Midlands Police ahead of the six-part series, which will be shown on BBC2 from tomorrow. The gang earned its chilling nickname through the practice of sewing razor blades into the peaks of their flat caps, so that they could blind rival gangsters by headbutting them. They ruled the industrialised areas of Bordesley and Small Heath from the 1880s through to the early 1900s, when the city was one of the world's most important manufacturing hubs. But their gritty story will receive a Hollywood sparkle with the broadcast of the new series - simply named Peaky Blinders - which will feature Inception and Batman star Cillian Murphy in the leading role. The records of the gang members were part of a roll of old charge sheets from the West Midlands Police Museum . To coincide with the release of the series, West Midlands Police dug up the original charge sheets for some of the gang members, which are now more than 100 years old. The fading sheets show that, despite the reputation of the gang for terrible crimes, these men and boys had been hauled up on relatively trivial offences. Fowler and Bayles, aged just 19 in the photographs, were charged with 'bike theft' after stealing the unattended item and attempting to sell it on. Stephen McHickie, 25 when pictured, was charged with breaking into a drapers shop which was just 11 doors from his own home. Gang members could start out as young as 13, like David Taylor, left, and often had run-ins with Birmingham's police . The Peaky Blinders ran their crime ring in the backstreets of Birmingham (pictured) Thomas Gilbert, much older than the others at 38, was arrested for the crime of 'false pretences'. All four gangsters are shown wearing the traditional Peak Blinders outfit, of donkey jackets, silk scarfs, bell-bottom trousers, steel-capped boots and a distinctive flat cap. Court reports from the time refer to the gang members as ""foul mouthed young men who stalk the streets in drunken groups, insulting and mugging passers-by."" West Midlands Police museum worker David Cross, 69, who works at the West Midlands Police Museum, explained the method behind the gangsters' signature weapon. The city was a vital centre of industry during the period the Peaky Blinders were active . A collection of young gang members are pictured in Birmingham's Clyde Street . The Summer Lane area of Birmingham, pictured, was plagued by crime . He said: 'It was quite a strange weapon they used to rob people, although makes sense when you think about it. 'When they would hit someone on the nose with their cap, it would bring tears to their victim's eyes and cause temporary blindness - that's when they'd thump you and rob you. 'It is a very quick manoeuvre - that is how they worked. They would target anybody who looked vulnerable, the gentleman on his way to work who didn't look strong or fit, ladies, teenage girls, anyone - they would take anything they could convert into money.' Police records show that baby-faced Harry Fowler was actually 19 when his mugshot, right, was committed to police records. Basic information about the youth, who was born in 1885, is recorded - a note was made that his hair is light brown, his eyes grey and that he has a 'pale' composition. It lists a round scar on his left cheek as a distinctive feature. He gave his occupation as 'barman', but police had caught up with him thanks to his membership of the Peaky Blinders. The charge, which dates from October 5 1904 sheet says Fowler had been taken in for stealing a bicycle. It also notes that he was given one month in prison for the offence. Ernest Bayles, right, is listed as a co-prisoner - taken in for the same crime of stealing a bicycle, which was left unattended outside a factory for just four minutes when the larcenous pair laid their hands on it. They were spotted almost immediately afterwards trying to make easy money selling it on the street. The sheets show that Bayles, born in 1885, was also 19. His is also said to have had light brown hair and grey eyes, but, unlike his companion, he had a 'fresh' complexion. It notes a mole on his right cheek, near the nose. He received two months in prison for the theft. Stephen McHickie, right, is listed next. His year of birth is given as 1879, making him 24 in the picture. The record notes his black hair and brown eyes, and says he has a 'sallow' complexion. It lists his distinctive features as tattoos of a woman on both his left and right arms, one of whom was labelled 'Louisa'. McHickie said he was a metal roller by occupation, but was recorded on October 24 1904 as having broken into a shop - reportedly a drapers just a few doors down the road from his own home. For his crime, the record states, he received eight months behind bars. Thomas Gilbert was the final entrant in the row of entries. His year of birth, listed 1866, makes him 38 - significantly older than the other Peaky Blinders listed on the record. The bald man is listed as having brown eyes and also brown hair - presumably deduced from his full moustache. The record says Gilbert, who said he was a fishmonger, had missing fingers and a distinctive mark on his right knee. He was charged on 18 October 1904, and his crime is listed as 'false pretences' - perhaps suggesting that he not involved with the more physical crimes like younger gang members. But theft and muggings was by no means the only illegal activity of the Peaky Blinders, who built a criminal empire on illegal betting, protection rackets and Birmingham's black market. The were known to fight with rival gangs, and at times would even turn on the police. Their previously unheard story is set to be told in the new BBC 2 six-part drama which was written by Birmingham-born Steven Knight, who claims members of his family were in the gang two generations ago. Irish actor Cillian Murphy plays Tommy Shelby, the leader of the Peaky Blinders, along with Sam Neill and Helen McCrory. Cillian Murphy will play Tommy Shelby, leader of the Peaky Blinders, in a new BBC series . The upcoming series will show the full extent of the Peaky Blinders' violent crimes . Cillian Murphy (left) said playing Tommy Shelby was the toughest role of his career . The central rivalry of the series will be between Tommy Selby, left, played by Cillian Murphy, and Chief Inspector Campbell, right, played by Sam Neill . In a recent interview, Mr Murphy, who had leading roles in Hollywood blockbusters Inception and Batman Begins, described the his character Tommy Shelby as 'by far the toughest I have ever portrayed' because of his physicality and the volume of fight scenes in the programme. The plot focuses on the Peaky Blinders era of the early 20th century, highlighting the gang members who returned to the poor and crime-ridden streets of Birmingham after the First World War. Mr Knight first had the idea for the drama 17 years ago based on stories he had been told by his parents, who grew up in Small Heath, Birmingham. Peaky Blinder women were easy to spot because of their fine clothes, as shown here by Helen McCrory (right) as Aunt Polly Gray, and Annabelle Wallis, left, as Grace Burgess, who will be Tommy Shelby's principal love interest in the series . The proceeds of crime also allowed the Peaky Blinders to enjoy the trappings of wealth . In the series Aunt Polly Gray, left, has been running the gang for years while the men were at war, and struggles with returning power to Freddie Thorne, right, played by Iddo Goldbery . The Peaky Blinders often came to blows with the police - as shown here between Paul Anderson, left, as Arthur Shelby, and Sam Neill, right, as Chief Inspector Campbell . The series shows policemen even taking to horseback to deal with the dangerous gang . Writer Steven Knight said the inspiration from the new series came from stories his father told him . The series, featuring Iddo Goldberg, left, as Freddie Thorne, and Sophie Rundle, right, as Ada Shelby, will bring the backstreets of Birmingham to life . In a previous interview he said: 'My mum was a bookie’s runner when she was ten. The police used to look out for people making illegal bets, so they used kids. 'And my dad told me about his uncles, who he said were part of the Peaky Blinders gang. 'When he was a kid he was told to take a message to them.

The Mail Online first reported the curious case of the Clark brothers earlier this year. But now their condition is deteriorating to the point where Mrs Clark fears they will no longer be able to walk or feed themselves, like babies. The family will feature on a Channel Four documentary tonight which follows them on their fascinating and traumatic journey over the last few months as they struggle with their day-to-day life. Matthew, 39, and his wife had a daughter, Lydia, now 19. She has had a baby, making him a grandfather . Their plight has led to them being likened to the character played by Brad Pitt in the film The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, an old man who gradually becomes younger. But Mrs Clark said she finds the analogy upsetting. She told the Independent:  'For one thing, they're not getting smaller – there's no return to them being cute little boys, they're big strong men – and that presents a quite different set of problems.' She said she first realised something 'was not right' when she and Mr Clark took them on a family holiday. The men acted childish throughout, shouting and cheering 'yippee' as the plane took off and squabbling like young children. They were both in their thirties at the time. The men had both been academically bright, with Matthew  offered places both in the Royal Navy and at agricultural college, and Michael joining the RAF at the age of 20. Both men were married and all had seemed to be going well for them. Matthew and his wife had a daughter, Lydia – now 19 – and Michael also had stepchildren. Mr and Mrs Clark decided to take early retirement and then, seven years ago, they sold their home in Gloucestershire and moved to a village near Benidorm, hoping their sons would visit when they could. But the couple became concerned when Michael and Matthew stopped returning calls. 'And then, one day, Lydia phoned to say a worker from a hostel had called to say her dad was living there, and there were some problems he needed to discuss,' Mrs Clark said. It seems the couple's departure coincided with their sons' downward spiral, and the men, by now both divorced, had become gradually unable to look after themselves, and ended up on benefits and sharing a squalid flat. Mrs Clark said Michael (pictured) is the most child-like and moody, and he can't be left on his own . The brothers share memories of happier times. The men are getting mentally younger by the day . Mr and Mrs Clark say when they returned to find their sons had been arguing like toddlers and no longer able to live together. Michael had moved out of the flat and into a hostel, where workers arranged for him to have medical checks. When doctors realised he had a brother with similar problems, they ran a series of genetic tests, which revealed both brothers were found to have terminal leukodystrophy. It means the mens' brains were being destroyed. Both intellectually and emotionally, they were returning to their babyhood. The couple were left with no other option than to leave their dream retirement and return home to care for their sons, who are now getting younger by the day. Mrs Clark said Michael is the most child-like and moody, and he can't be left on his own, whereas Matthew talks all the time, saying 'whatever comes into his head.' She said: 'They can be very affectionate, particularly with one another – they'll often put their arms around one another, and Michael will say, 'He's my little brother'. Just like small children, they wake up a lot during the night – I was up seven times with them last night – and, also like children, they'll deny and deny that they're tired, even when you can see their eyelids drooping.' Mrs Clark said Matthew talks all the time, saying 'whatever comes into his head' Leukodystrophy is a neurological disease which affects the brain, nervous system and the spinal cord. The condition usually only affects newborns, and is so rare there are only 100 people affected in the whole of the UK. Leukodystrophies are mostly inherited disorders, meaning that it is passed on from parent to child. The Myelin Project funds research into the disease. CEO of Myelin's British arm, Lynda Carthy, said: 'There is an estimated one in three billion chance of two people who carry the gene deficiency meeting and becoming partners. 'The chances of the children developing the condition are dependant on what type of leukodystrophy the parents have. If both have the recessive gene then there is a one in four chance of the children having the disease. 'If only the mother has the gene every boy born would have a form of leukodystrophy. Of course it's important to say there are 37 known types of the disease at the moment but doctors are diagnosing new forms which simply have not been catalogued yet and named.' The word leukodystrophy comes from the Greek words leuko (meaning white), trophy (meaning growth), and dys (meaning ill). The words put together, form leukodystrophy - a set of diseases that affect the growth or maintenance of the white matter (myelin). All leukodystrophies are a result of problems with the growth or maintenance of the myelin sheath - so far about forty different types of leukodystrophy have been identified.","Brothers Michael, 42, and Matthew Clark, 39, from Hull, have been diagnosed with leukodystrophy .

"More stormy weather is set to batter Britain this weekend - with some areas hit with almost a month's rainfall in 24 hours and gusts of up to 70mph. Despite relatively pleasant conditions today, the Met Office has issued three yellow - or severe - rain warnings until tomorrow as yet another stormy front moves in from the Atlantic. Two yellow warnings were in place for Northern Ireland and Scotland yesterday, while another for the north west and west of England was issued early this morning. Rowers enjoy glorious Spring conditions in Cambridge - but the country will be battered with heavy rain and strong gusts of winds due to another stormy front moving in from the Atlantic . Scarlett Clarke, four, sits among purple crocuses in Oadby, Leicestershire. Coastal areas in the west of the country will be hit with up to 70mph gusts . Cumbria and surrounding areas face up to 80mm of rain on Sunday. The average rainfall for Cumberland in February is 102mm. Already flooded areas in the south and south west will not escape either  - with up to 15mm of rain falling on Sunday. The Environment Agency still has 48 severe flood warnings issued across the UK following what the Met Office has described as the wettest winter on record. A Met Office graphic shows heavy rain (red, orange and yellow patches being the heaviest) approaching the west of the country this afternoon . Strong winds of up to 70mph will rip . through western coastal areas of the country, The Met Office said today. Areas of Wales and the south west will be hit with up to 50 to 60mph, it added. A spokesman for the Met Office explained the further barrage of bad weather was due low pressure moving in from the Atlantic. They added: 'The wind will start to pick up from this afternoon and it will stay windy through the rest of the weekend. '80mph will be the top end of the scale and 70mph winds are more likely across the west of the country. 'Much of south west England and Somerset will not suffer from too much rain - around 10-15mm is expected before the end of Monday.' The latest storms come as Met Office scientists warn recent stormy weather could be linked to climate change. An open letter, printed in The Times yesterday and signed by weather experts, including the Met Office's chief scientist Dame Julia Slingo, said the risk of flooding is increasing with global warming. The letter states: 'We have looked at the potential influence of climate change and all the evidence from observations, theory and models which show that a warming world leads to more intense daily and hourly rainfall. 'When we add rising sea levels, then the risk to our communities from serious flooding and coastal inundation are increasing with climate change.' However, they warned that the link between recent flooding and climate change was not 'definitive' and further research was needed.

'The UK has always been buffeted by Atlantic storms and it is reasonable to expect occasional extremes.' The letter is also signed by Professor Stephen Belcher, a leading climate change expert from the Met Office Hadley Centre, Professor Adam Scaife, who studies monthly and decadal climate change, and Dr Mark McCarthy from the National Climate information Centre. The comments come in the wake of a political row over the extent climate change is to blame for the heavy flooding which have inundated large parts of Britain over recent months. Two more rowers enjoy the morning light in Cambridge.

"Conservative climate change sceptics have been ordered to ‘shut it’, by the Lib Dems. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said there was ‘overwhelming evidence’ of the need to cut carbon emissions. He singled out former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson and Conservative MP Peter Lilley for particular criticism, in the latest coalition spat over the environment. Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey said climate change sceptics in the Tory should 'shut it' The Lib Dems have stepped up their attacks on the Tories over the environment in recent weeks. Mr Davey told EurActiv, a Brussels-based news website: ;My recommendation to most politicians who want to talk about the climate is to listen to the scientists and listen to the evidence. ‘Of course you can question it, but when there is overwhelming evidence you should tend to shut it.’ Mr Lilley responded: ‘People who try to silence their critics are revealing their own inability to respond to the arguments that people like I and Nigel Lawson put. ‘I don’t question climate science. I just question the interpretation [Mr Davey] puts on it.’ It follows comments by Lord Lawson last month when he insisted there was no evidence that extreme weather was linked to climate change, and urged scientists to admit they did not know what was happening. He said: 'I think we want to focus not on this extremely speculative and uncertain area. I don’t blame the climate scientists for not knowing. 'Climate and weather is quite extraordinarily complex and this is a very new form of science. All I blame them for is pretending they know when they don’t.' Lord Lawson (left) claimed there was no evidence linking the floods to climate change while Peter Lilley said he does not question climate science, only Mr Davey's interpretation of it . Mr Davey has previously attacked ‘diabolical’ and ‘wilfully ignorant, head in the sand, nimbyist’ Conservatives who question global warming. But Michael Fallon, the senior Tory minister in Mr Davey’s energy department, hit back at his boss, insisting: ‘Unthinking climate change worship has damaged British industry and put up consumer bills.’ Tory Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, seen as a leading climate sceptic in the Cabinet, has attracted criticism for not setting out his views publicly. One Cabinet minister told MailOnline: ‘He just isn’t very bright. Most of the people around the Cabinet table are bright, even if I disagree with them, but not Owen. He isn’t climate sceptic, he’s climate stupid.’ Today Mr Paterson told BBC Radio 4: ‘The climate is changing and there is clearly a human element.’","Energy Secretary launches fresh attack on coalition partners .

"British Gas has been hit by a 6 per cent fall in profits after fed up customers switched to cheaper rivals. Parent company Centrica revealed its arm supplying homes with gas and electricity made £571million in 2013, down from £606million a year earlier. Chief executive Sam Laidlaw hit out at political attacks on the industry but critics said the firm was continuing to make huge profits ‘on the back of spiralling bills for hard-pressed consumers’. British Gas saw profits fall by 6 per cent, after 2 per cent of customers switched to rival firms . British Gas lost two per cent of its residential customers 2013, down to 15.3 million as households switched to other suppliers. It came after its move to increase bills by 9.2per cent on average from November as part of the winter round of price hikes. Another 100,000 people have quit the group so far this year. But the company claimed customer switching was now ‘stabilising’ after it scaled back its price rise by 3.2per cent following a shake-up of the Government's so-called green levies on bills. Across the Centrica group as a whole, operating profits were 2 per cent lower at £2.7 billion last year. Mr Laidlaw admitted that public and investor trust in the energy industry had been ‘damaged’ by the threat of price controls and political intervention. He said: ‘British Gas has reduced prices, designed new, competitive propositions and has a renewed focus on service. ‘Our customers trust us to keep their lights on and their homes warm, as well as making the big, long-term investments which will secure their supplies for the future. 'As we continue to debate the right future shape and structure of our industry, we will never lose sight of that.’ However he attacked Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze bills for two years if Labour wins power in 2015, saying it was ‘not a credible solution’. He said: ‘We firmly believe that any form of price control in a competitive market is not the answer and is not in the best interests of customers, and this has been clearly demonstrated by experience in other markets. ‘Such proposals create both short-term uncertainty for all energy suppliers and longer-term additional costs for customers,’ he added. Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw blamed politicians for creating uncertainty in the energy market . Shares in Centrica have plunged by more than a fifth since autumn following Labour's price freeze pledge. The stock has been driven down further after Energy Secretary Ed Davey recently called for a full-scale investigation into the energy market that could see British Gas broken up. In a letter, Mr Davey urged competition authorities to ‘think radically’ as they consider whether to launch a probe. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘British Gas are still posting decent profits, despite angry customers leaving following recent price hikes and the company receiving over a million complaints last year. ‘When healthy profits aren't based on satisfied customers it's further evidence the energy market is broken.’ Centrica's results showed that higher wholesale prices and unseasonally warm weather at the end of last year saw British Gas suffer an 18 per cent slump in operating profit in the final six months of 2013, which offset a better start to the year. Caroline Flint, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said: ‘However you look at it, there’s no hiding the fact that on David Cameron’s watch the energy companies have made their profits on the back of spiralling bills for hard-pressed consumers. ‘That’s why the next Labour Government will undertake the biggest overhaul of our energy market since privatisation. ‘Our plans will break up the big energy companies, put an end to their secret deals and make tariffs simpler and fairer.

"A 20-year-old student died of a heart attack after taking a fatal dose of ecstasy with her boyfriend at a nightclub in London, an inquest heard . Taylor Mae Woodard, an aspiring showbiz journalist studying at Bournemouth University, shared half a gram of MDMA with her boyfriend, Alex Rickett, at Plan B nightclub in Brixton. After returning to Mr Rickett's home in Worcester Park, south-west London, in the early hours of March 9, she collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Scroll down for video . Taylor Mae Woodard, a student at Bournemouth University, died after sharing half a gram of MDMA with her boyfriend at a nightclub in London . Miss Woodard and Alex Ricketts took the ecstasy in a bathroom at Plan B nightclub, in Brixton . Despite Mr Rickett's best efforts to save her, Miss Woodard was rushed to Kingston Hospital and died at 6.22am. The inquest heard that she had taken the Class A drug every two to three weeks, and police found an empty stash of white powder in her pocket, which she may have taken without telling her boyfriend. West London Coroner Jeremy Chipperfield said a toxicology report discovered Tayla had fatal levels of ecstasy in her blood when she died. He said: 'Alex Rickett was going out with Tayla on a night out and they took drugs bought by Tayla from her home in Bournemouth at the Plan B nightclub in Brixton. 'They travelled back from the nightclub. Tayla collapsed and lost consciousness very soon afterwards. 'MDMA she had taken was present in her system at level associated with death. She had intended to use MDMA, which is not unusual with young people. 'Unfortunately on this occasion it tragically had fatal consequences. Tayla died of MDMA toxicity, an accidental death.' Miss Woodard, 20, collapsed at Mr Rickett's home and died in the early hours of March 9 at Kingston Hospital . A police officer later found another bag of ecstasy in her jacket pocket, which Miss Woodard may have taken in the nightclub. Mr Rickett had not know about it. Her father Russell Woodard, who was at the inquest with his wife, Julia, told the court: 'She confessed to me in her first year of university [that] she had taken drugs. At the time I did research. 'I spoke to her and said it was not a good idea to do it again because she did not know what was in it. I think she thought it was better not to tell me in future. 'I wouldn't be surprised if Tayla had taken the drug occasionally, I'm surprised to hear she took it every two to three weeks.' Russell Woodard, Tayla's father, said she had told him she had started taking drugs during her first year of university. Mr Rickett wept as he explained how they had spent the day together, drinking a small amount of vodka and wine before going out to the nightclub with a couple of his friends at around 11pm. Miss Woodard brought a gram of brown MDMA with her and the couple shared half of it in the toilets. They left the club at around 3.30am and headed back to his house in Tamesis Gardens, in Worcester Park, south-west London. He said: 'I had done less than usual and she had taken less MDMA than usual because of the amount left in the bag. We did it every two to three weeks. 'She was normal, she seemed normal. We were cleaning our teeth in the bathroom, she was sitting on the bath then she collapsed into the bath.' 'I picked her up and laid her on the bathroom floor. I woke my brother and called the ambulance, I can't remember in which order. 'I rang to ask when the ambulance was coming because her nose was turning purple. They told me how to do mouth to mouth. 'The ambulance came and the paramedics did CPR and then they took her away.' Dr Philip Halliday, from Kingston Hospital, said he had been told she had taken 250mg of MDMA with alcohol. Pathologist Dr Robert Chapman, who carried out the post-mortem examination, described Miss Woodard as fit and healthy. He said: 'The toxicology report showed she had high levels of MDMA, 1.64mg per litre in her blood, but the level of ethanol alcohol was not particularly high.' The fatal level of MDMA is anything above 0.1mg. Detective Constable Ian Moody, who helped perform the investigation into her death, said Mr Rickett had given the rest of the MDMA to police for analysis and nothing unusual was found in it. He added: 'I went back to Tamesis Gardens, where she collapsed, and found the denim jacket she had been wearing in the bathroom. 'I searched the jacket and found a small snap bag containing remnants of white powder, which was analysed and found to be MDMA as well. 'Alex told me he had not known about the second bag.' Mr Woodard has since raised almost £1,000 in his girlfriend's memory, with donations going to mental health charity Mind. Ecstasy came into widespread use in the 1980s, when taking it was linked to raves and dance music. The Class A drug comes in powder and pill form. Its effects include euphoria, a sense of intimacy with others and diminished anxiety and depression. Research  has suggested that long-term changes to emotional states and behaviour have been triggered by consumption of the drug, which affects chemical receptors in the brain. The synthetic stimulant triggers the release of dopamine, the chemical that controls the nervous system, producing a massive increase in heart rate and blood pressure. This can prove fatal. Medical studies also report that one in four people have suffered unpleasant side-effects, such as extreme paranoia and insomnia. Campaigners believe that ecstasy poses a real risk of triggering brain damage. They have argued that it can induce memory loss, decrease cognitive performance and has long-lasting effects on behaviour.","Student Tayla Mae Woodard died after taking ecstasy with her boyfriend .

"Powerful winds in the Pacific Ocean, which have driven surface heat deep underwater, could be the reason behind the current ‘pause’ in global warming. This is according to a joint Australian and U.S. study which has looked at why there has been a slowdown in the planet’s global average surface temperature over the past decade. Their research shows that trade winds in central and eastern parts of the Pacific have caused warm surface water to sink to the ocean's depths, reducing the amount of heat in the atmosphere. Scroll down for video... Shown here are the global monthly mean sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies from 1961-90. Sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface. An anomaly is a departure from average conditions. Some scientists believe winds in central and eastern parts of the Pacific have caused warm surface water to sink to the ocean's depths . Last year, scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said the pace of temperature rise at the Earth's surface had slowed over the past 15 years. This is despite the fact concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased to levels that are unprecedented in at least 800,000 years . The latest study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, said stronger Pacific trade winds- had made ocean circulation at the Equator speed up. This schematic shows the trends in temperature and ocean atmosphere circulation in the Pacific over the past two decades. Colour shading shows observed temperature trends (°C per decade) during 1992-2011 at the sea surface. The bold and thin arrows show an overall acceleration of the Pacific Ocean moving warm, surface waters (indicated by the blue arrow) to below 700 metres beneath the surface . Scientists claim one of the causes of the pause in sea-surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water. They believe this exchange is occurring between warm, surface waters and cold, deep waters below 700 metres . Scientists claim one of the causes of the‘plateau’ in sea-surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water. They believe this exchange is occurring between warm, surface waters and cold, deep waters below 700 metres – as if the warming is ‘hiding’ underwater. Easterly trade winds of the Pacific Ocean have increased significantly over the past two decades and as a result are blowing higher volumes of warm surface sea water to deeper depths. Stronger trade winds blowing from South America to Australia have had the net effect of cooling surface temperatures by a global average of between 0.1°C and 0.2°C, . This would be enough to account for the apparent hiatus in global average temperatures over the past 15 years. The warm water won’t hide below the surface forever: scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators, such as sea level or ocean circulation. This pattern of easterly winds, which spans the tropics, has moved heat deeper into the ocean and brought cooler water to the surface. The winds have also helped drive cooling in other ocean regions. ‘We show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming,’ said the study, led by scientists from the University of New South Wales in Australia. ‘The net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1-0.2 °C, which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming since 2001.’ The study's authors, including scientists from other research centres and universities in the U.S., Hawaii and Australia, used weather forecasting and satellite data and climate models to make their conclusions. ‘This hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade winds trends continue, however, rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate,’ the study said. ‘If the anomalously strong trade winds begin to abate in the next few years, the model suggests the present hiatus will be short-lived, with rapid warming set to resume soon after the wind trends reverse,’ it added. Commenting on the study, Richard Allan, professor of climate science at Britain's University of Reading, said: ‘These changes are temporarily masking the effects of man-made global warming.’ The fact that temperatures have risen more slowly in the past 15 years despite rising greenhouse gas emissions has emboldened sceptics who challenge the evidence for man-made climate change and question the need for urgent action. The IPCC does not expect the hiatus to last and has said temperatures from 2016-35 were likely to be 0.3-0.7°C warmer than in 1986-2005. ‘More than 93 per cent of the warming of the planet since 1970 is found in the ocean,’ said Steve Rintoul at Australia's CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research and lead author of the chapter on oceans in the IPCC's latest climate report. ‘If we want to understand and track the evolution of climate change we need to look in the oceans. The oceans have continued to warm unabated, even during the recent 'hiatus' in warming of surface temperature.’ Climate scientists say such pauses in warming occur regularly throughout history and can last for up to 20 years – but cannot be predicted. They add that the warm water won’t hide below the surface forever. Scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators, such as sea level or ocean circulation.","IPCC report last year said temperatures have barely risen in past 15 years .

But it’s not bad news for all the inhabitants of the Thames Valley. The river’s population of Depressed River Mussels is safe. As residents faced an uncertain future, it emerged the Environment Agency rejected calls to dredge the flood-hit lower reaches of the Thames because of the presence of the endangered mollusc. Scroll down for video . River view: Pharoah's island can be seen in the middle of the Thames as it passes between Shepperton and Weybridge . Submerged: now the island is indistinguishable from its surroundings after the river burst its banks . In a 2010 report, seen by the Mail, they ruled out dredging between Datchet and Staines because the river bed was home to the vulnerable creatures. And even though a public consultation indicated support for de-silting work, the quango said it would be ‘environmentally unacceptable’ due to the ‘high impact on aquatic species’. But last night a spokesman at the Environment Agency said the report on mussels was ‘badly worded’ and the presence of the mussels would not have been the only argument against dredging. ‘If protected species are living in a river and dredging would reduce the risk of flooding then we would ensure that dredging occurs without having a serious impact on wildlife,’ he said. ‘This is case not just for the Thames but all rivers.’ Saved, but at what cost: The endangered Depressed River Mussel . But he added; ‘An independent study carried out by engineering firm Halcrow has shown that the natural activity of the Thames removes significantly more silt than mechanical dredging would do.’ The revelation came as it emerged that EU waste regulations have made regular dredging on Britain’s rivers uneconomic. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that the disposal of silt became so complex and expensive that it was more attractive to take advantage of financial incentives given by Brussels to conservation schemes. This Despite the Agency describing that stretch of the river as one of the ‘largest and most at-risk developed and undefended flood plains in England’. Hundreds of houses on the Thames are presently under water and there are fears the situation could get worse. The Thames river has hit record levels causing extensive flooding to parts of the southeast of England . The Depressed River Mussel, the name of which comes from the flattened shape of its shell, is categorised by environmentalists as ‘vulnerable and threatened’, with the number of rivers it lives in declining by 30 per cent in the past 25 years. However, some believe the UK actually has the healthiest populations in Europe, with the possible exception of Finland. One river - the Waveney - may have 1.2million of the mussels alone. The agency’s report said: ‘A number of protected and threatened species are known to be present in the waters of the Lower Thames, including the Depressed River Mussel, which is a UK Biodiversity Action Plan species, and on the IUCN Red List as near-threatened. ‘This poses a constraint on any works to be undertaken within the River Thames itself, especially activities such as dredging.’ A ‘strategy appraisal report’, compiled by the agency into the prospect of defence works on the Lower Thames in August 2010, said dredging was one of the ‘options rejected at preliminary stage’. The Environment Agency described that stretch of the river as one of the 'largest and most at-risk developed and undefended flood plains in England' However, the previous year the Agency held a public consultation with residents along the banks of the Thames, and the official report shows that they thought ‘dredging of pinch points of the River Thames is essential to provide interim relief from flooding’. Tory MPs said they were appalled that the Environment Agency appeared to be more interested in promoting the welfare of molluscs than householders. Douglas Carswell said: ‘Ever since we have given responsibility for flood defences to this central quango, they’ve elevated the interests of the natural over and above the human. 'We can see the consequences today. There is nothing nice about letting our rivers and coastline revert to nature. London used to be a swamp, and if we leave these clowns in charge it will return to that.’ Alok Sharma, Tory MP for the flood-affected Thames-side constituency of Reading West, said: ‘The priority has to be protecting people and property not mussels. Ultimately, any decision on dredging any river has to take into account the impact on communities living further downstream.’ Regular dredging was undertaken for 50 years on the stretch of river from Datchet to Staines following the 1947 floods, but was stopped in 1996 when the agency took over responsibility.","The endangered mollusc halted calls to dredge strife-hit stretch of water .

"Anger: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, pictured in an expensive Savile Row suit yesterday, has sparked outrage by claiming foreign aid will help prevent flooding in the UK . A cabinet minister sparked fury last night after claiming that giving billions of pounds to the Third World would help prevent flooding in Britain. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected demands from Tory MPs that the overseas aid budget be raided to help stricken areas of the West Country, claiming that the money would help curb global warming. His claims prompted anger among residents whose homes are under water and from Conservatives, who branded the claims ‘nonsense’. Sharon Saunders, 45, a barmaid from Bridgwater, Somerset, which is at risk of being overwhelmed by flood water, said: ‘Eric Pickles has lost the plot. Charity begins at home and we need to sort this place out before we doing anything else. ‘He needs to come down here for himself and see what it’s like before diverting money anywhere else.’ Helen Marsell, 47, a retail worker from Bridgwater, said: ‘The Government is very quick to jump on the bandwagon for aid donations when something bad happens in another country, but when a disaster strikes here their attitude is, “Oh, it’s only our country, we don’t need to worry about it”.’ Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘I’m not convinced these floods are caused by global warming. But even if they were, the biggest contributors to global warming are China and America and we don’t give them aid money. It’s just utter nonsense.’ No escape from the tide: The Kirby family, pictured inside their flooded home in Moorland, have been forced to evacuate. Pictured are Mark Kirby, his wife Kate and their children, Dom, 16, Georgine, 14, and Theo, 10 . Awash: Kate Kirby wades through waist deep flood water outside her home in Moorland, Somerset, as she saves a few possessions from the rising water . The Mail revealed on Saturday that Tory MPs are demanding cash from Britain’s £11billion-a-year aid budget is diverted to help people stricken by the floods. But Mr Pickles rejected that plan as a ‘populist hit’ and added: ‘If it is truly global warming, then aid we’re offering in other parts of the world could well have an effect in terms of the things that happen in this country.’ Britain has already pledged nearly £2.9billion of taxpayers’ money – or around £100 per household – to a climate aid fund for developing countries over four years. Mr Pickles yesterday offered an ‘unreserved apology’ for the failure to dredge the Somerset Levels and signalled that Environment Agency chairman Lord Smith should resign over the ‘mistake’. View: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (arriving at the BBC studios for The Andrew Marr Show with his wife Irene) said foreign aid spending could ease global warming-linked extreme weather in Britain . Comments: Asked what he made of remarks to deploy foreign aid to help with the floods, Mr Pickles told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'Well, I think it's an easy hit, it's a kind of a populist hit' He pointedly refused to endorse the Labour peer’s leadership of the agency, saying: ‘That’s a matter for him.’ He added: ‘I don’t see myself becoming an advocate of the “Save Chris Smith” campaign or printing “Save the Environment Agency One” T-shirts.’ Lord Smith accused ministers of ‘playing politics’ with the flood crisis. Writing in the Guardian, he said: ‘Politicians need to realise that it’s in fact government rules – laid down by successive governments, Labour and Tory – that are at the heart of the problem.’ Disaster: Moorland in Somerset has been abandoned because all of its streets are completely underwater . Destroyed: The sight of their belongings floating in the brown water proved too much for some families . Ministers rushed to find emergency funds for flood-hit Somerset, but when it comes to tackling extreme weather abroad the pot is apparently deep. Britain has pledged nearly £2.9billion of taxpayers’ money – around £100 per household – in climate aid to help developing countries over four years. It includes £15million to help cattle farmers in Colombia practise ‘green agriculture’, such as adapting cows’ diets to reduce the methane they produce, and £14million to build wind farms and other renewable energy sources in Uganda. When the money was pledged at UN climate talks just over a year ago, energy minister Greg Barker said it was a ‘sensible investment for British people’. ‘If we turn our back on the developing world we will see more failed states … countries struggling and failing to deal with the impact of dangerous climate change and ultimately we pay the price in British lives,’ he said. Britain pays £140million to climate change projects abroad and further funds have been sent to countries hit by flooding, including £42.5million to Pakistan in 2011, £75million to Bangladesh in 2008 and £12million to Mozambique in 2000.","Tory MPs have called for foreign aid budget to be raided to help stricken areas of the West Country .

"Dozens of vulnerable girls were bought and sold for sex by paedophiles running a modern-day slavery ring, police revealed yesterday. Many of the 24 victims – some as young as 11 – were groomed, drugged and routinely raped over six years. Council chiefs last night faced calls to set up an inquiry after it emerged that all the girls involved were known to social services or had been in their care. Scroll down for video . Major operation: Dozens of officers are briefed before descending on homes across Oxford in a series of dawn raids to arrest a gang on suspicion of child sex trafficking . Mobilising: Officers loads up their cars as prepared to execute 14 warrants across the city . The shocking scale of abuse in the . affluent university city of Oxford was revealed after police arrested 13 . men on suspicion of a variety of offences, including causing the . prostitution of females under the age of 18, trafficking and rape. Police are investigating the theory . that the paedophile gang used social networking sites to swap . information about victims, who in some cases were ‘conveyed’ to other . parts of the country for sex. All the victims were aged between 11 . and 16, and were described as being ‘very, very vulnerable’ by a senior . detective. It is feared many more under-age girls were targeted by the . gang. All the victims were approached . individually before being groomed for sex and  sold on for profit. The . amounts of money involved are unclear but investigators believe . thousands of pounds could have exchanged hands. Thames Valley Police refused to reveal . the ethnicity of the suspected gang members, saying such information . could result in victims being identified. Nor would they reveal whether the victims  had been in foster care or care homes when they were . Ready to move in: Police vans lined up ahead of the operation, which is investigating the alleged sexual exploitation of girls as young as 11 . Last-minute preparations: Officers huddle round as they receive final instructions. Police believe the suspects carried out the alleged abuse for six years as the youngsters were sold for sex and even given drugs so they could be raped . Among those detained was a married . father of two, aged 29, from the Cowley area of Oxford. A relative, who . would not give his name, said: ‘The police came early this morning and . arrested him. They would not say what he was arrested for. They said . they were looking for evidence.’ Esther Davidson, from Oxford Community . Against Trafficking, said: ‘We now have  to face the fact modern . slavery takes  place in our community, and it involves children. ‘Yes, criminals are at work, but they . are also exploiting demand. Demand for sex with under-age children is . completely unacceptable.’ Sharon Highton, who runs the Include . project at East Oxford Community Centre for youngsters who have been . excluded from schools, said: ‘There is a huge problem with sex grooming . in the area and social services are not taking any action. They seem to . wait until something major happens before they intervene.’ Alleged members of the child sex ring . were detained in a series of police raids early yesterday. More than 140 . officers burst into the homes of gang suspects and their ‘customers’ in . synchronised raids across Oxford at 6am and arrested 12 men. A . thirteenth suspect was arrested. Protection: Detective Superintendent Rob Mason, of Thames Valley Police, said the arrests were intended to protect the girls from further harm . ‘The investigation involves a criminal . gang who are selling young girls for sex,’ said Detective . Superintendent Rob Mason. ‘These include people involved in the business . of selling young girls, and their customers.’ Most of the victims, who cannot be . identified for legal reasons, are from the Oxfordshire area. ‘It would . be fair to say that at different times in their lives they have all come . to the notice of children’s services,’ said Detective Superintendent . Mason. Police said they were being trafficked within the UK. ‘What we believe we have uncovered is a . criminal gang getting financial profit from selling  young girls and . they are conveying them from Oxford to customers,’ he added. ‘We consider the girls to be very, . very vulnerable and that’s why they have been targeted. The girls have . gone missing and when they returned they have made certain disclosures. ‘Through children’s services and . Oxfordshire County Council we have become aware of some of the . activities the girls have been getting into when they’ve gone missing.’ The trafficking came to light when . police began an investigation – codenamed Operation Bullfinch – looking . at reports of girls going missing from their homes. The 13 suspects, . aged between 21 and 37, were being interviewed at various police . stations. More than 40 uniformed officers and . community support officers were yesterday handing out A5 flyers about . the operation to reassure the public. Detectives also posted a video on YouTube to reassure community members and urge any potential victims to come forward. Stuart Craft, an Oxford councillor, . said he had grave concerns about children’s services in the area. He . added: ‘I would not be surprised if these exploited girls did not have . any confidence in their social workers and that is why this has been . allowed to go on for so long.’ Local councillor Mary Clarkson said: . ‘Children in care have had a bad start to life and they need to be . protected. I would be very upset if it came to light that this was a . failing on the part of social services and will be calling for an . investigation if these girls were not given the right protection.’ Councillor Louise Chapman, cabinet . member for children, young people and families at Oxfordshire Council, . said: ‘The council has assisted in what has been a complex investigation . leading to today’s events. Its focus has been, and will continue to be, . on the care for alleged victims.’ Last night, four of those arrested, . aged in their 20s and 30s, were released on police bail while detectives . continue there .

"When it comes to sibling rivalry, no one is quite so extravagantly competitive as the Ecclestone sisters. Now their oneupmanship has spread to the most exclusive tier of the American property market. For just a few months after Petra bought a mansion once named as the most expensive home in the States, Tamara is set to move into the house ranked No 2 – just down the road. The older daughter of Formula  1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone is eyeing up the lavish Fleur de Lys estate to add to her property portfolio, undeterred by its £78 million asking price. The five-acre estate in the Holmby Hills in Bel Air, Los Angeles, was modelled on Louis XIV’s Palace of Versailles – and certainly contains all the opulent luxuries a modern-day princess could demand. As well as its 12 bedrooms and 15 bathrooms, the mansion contains a 50-seat, satin-lined private cinema, a two-storey wood-panelled library stocked with first-edition books and garage parking for nine cars. Not to mention a gym, a ballroom based on Louis XIV’s Hall of Mirrors at Versailles and a formal dining room. A moving story: Tamara' relocation to the Fleur de Lys mansion will be chronicled on an American reality TV show . Italian marble walls, French limestone floors and gold-embossed leather wall coverings all add to the decadent feel. And outside, the property boasts a spa pool with its own kitchen, an ornamental garden, a 1,200-metre running track, a championship tennis court and a folly – plus private quarters to house  up to ten live-in domestic staff . The 45,000 sq ft house, tucked  away behind gates and a 200-yard driveway, was commissioned in 1996 by Texan billionaire David Saperstein for his wife Suzanne. It was completed in 2002 – but less than two years later the couple’s 23-year marriage collapsed. Mrs Saperstein was awarded the estate in the divorce, and put it on the market in 2006 for £78 million. In 2010, Forbes magazine named it as the  second most expensive property in America – behind late TV guru Aaron Spelling’s 123-room mansion, The Manor, just down the road. Sibling rivalry: Just a few months after Petra Ecclestone (right) bought the mansion once named the as the most expensive home in the States, Tamara is set to move into the house ranked No2 -  just down the road . Silver screen: Tamara can invite 49 of her closest friends to watch the latest blockbusters in her private cinema . Time to reflect: The gilded ballroom features mirror-clad arches based on those in the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles, as well as impressive chandeliers and a ceiling fresco . And that was the home Petra bought from Spelling’s widow last year for a ‘bargain’ £53 million. It is the largest in Los Angeles County, and boasts a room solely designed for cutting flowers. The amount Petra paid for The Manor suggests Tamara might be able to drive a hard bargain on Fleur de Lys – even though Mrs Saperstein has never dropped her price in the six years the estate has remained unsold. Tamara, 28, already owns a £45 million home in Kensington Palace Gardens – London’s ‘billionaires’ row’ known as the most exclusive address in Britain. That 55-room mansion is currently undergoing an £18 million renovation, due for completion next month. It includes a £1 million bathtub and  special wardrobes for her £500,000 handbags collection. Hints of chintz: With its gold-embossed walls, the bedroom features a clutter of antique furniture - including the canopied bed, chaise longue and dressing table - as well as gold-framed paintings . Ready for a feast: A gold and floral theme dominates the dining room, which can comfortably seat 16 guests (left) while the two-storey wood-panelled library (right) is stocked with first-edition books . She is looking at Fleur de Lys as she relocates to Tinseltown this month. An eight-part reality series for American television will chart her move to the States – and Tamara plans to rent the lavish property before buying it. The series follows the three-part programme Billion $$ Girl for Channel 5, which similarly offered viewers an insight into her lifestyle, funded by her father’s £2.3 billion fortune. However, it has been a tumultuous year for Tamara, who separated from her boyfriend Omar Khyami after she discovered he had cheated on her – and made a sex tape of his encounter. So it is a strange coincidence that  she is moving into an estate that is available only because of another romantic split. Making a splash: The Romanesque outdoor pool, surrounded by sun-loungers... and if swimming makes you peckish, the columned pool house comes with its own kitchen . Saperstein, who made his fortune developing the idea of using helicopters to provide up-to-date traffic reports, left Suzanne in 2003 for Hillevi Svensson, the family’s 32-year-old Swedish nanny. The divorce, one of the most expensive in US history, came after Saperstein served his wife with divorce papers as the family’s Gulfstream IV made a stopover in Houston en route from California to Europe. The reason was Texas is thought to be more sympathetic to men than California when it comes to alimony settlements. Mrs Saperstein was once described in a Vanity Fair profile as ‘probably the world’s No 1 consumer of haute couture and 18th Century furniture’ – rumoured to buy matching designer sweaters and shoes in every colour available. In the past two years the Ecclestone sisters have built a similar reputation for profligacy, including spending more than £100 million of the family fortune buying up homes in some of London’s most prestigious postcodes. Neighbours: The Mnor - the 123-room plae also in the Holmby Hills - that little sister Petra bought . In 2010, Petra, now 24, paid £56 million for a Grade II listed townhouse in Chelsea, West London, previously owned by JCB billionaire Sir Anthony Bamford. And she spent a reported £11 million on her Italian wedding to businessman James Stunt last year. Her statuesque mother Slavica – who divorced Bernie in 2008 after 23 years of marriage – said at the time: ‘I don’t care how much the wedding cost, as it was once-in-a-lifetime occasion. It was worth every penny because it made my daughter happy. Who cares about money?’ Last night Tamara Ecclestone declined to comment on her move to Los Angeles.

"Former superintendent Roger Marshall arriving at the Hillsborough inquests in Warrington yesterday . A senior police officer has admitted 'profound regrets' for not delaying kick-off during the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy, but has maintained fans' drinking contributed to the disaster. Former superintendent Roger Marshall told the inquests into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans that when he realised the scale of the tragedy he went on 'auto-pilot because I linked the awful events on the terraces directly with my opening of the gates'. He also told the inquest into the events of the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest that asking for the 3pm kick-off to be put back was an option open to him. He told the jury of seven women and four men sitting in Warrington: 'I could certainly have requested a delay of kick-off. 'I can tell you that it was one of the most profound regrets of my experience at Leppings Lane on the 15th of April that I did not do so.' He said he made four radio requests from 2.47pm onwards to the police control box for three exit gates at the Leppings Lane turnstiles of Sheffield Wednesday's ground to be opened amid his fears 'somebody would be killed if the gates weren't opened'. Exit Gate C was then opened at 2.52pm on the orders of the match commander, chief superintendent David Duckenfield, with the jury previously hearing that an estimated 2,000 Liverpool fans came through and 'a significant number' headed for a central tunnel leading to the terraces of pens three and four behind the goal. Yesterday however, he maintained fans' drinking was partly to to blame. During his patrols outside the stadium before heading to the Leppings Lane area from 2pm, he had noted a 'carnival atmosphere', but there was 'a tremendous amount of drinking going on here, there and everywhere'. Scroll down for video . On foot in the crowds, he said he was aware that the build-up of the crowd grew progressively from 2.30pm and he said he asked the crowd to stop pushing from 2.35pm onwards. Mr Marshall said it was people joining the back who were pushing. At 2.40pm Mr Marshall climbed on to the parapet of the bridge over the River Don and said it was the first time he got 'a really good view' of the area. Christina Lambert QC said: 'Was this the time you became really anxious?' He said: 'The congestion. The fact that people were shoving and pushing. They did not need to do so but they did.' The barrister asked him if he thought at that point the fans were going to get inside the stadium in time for kick-off. He said: 'Surprisingly, no. They had no chance but at the time I thought possibly they could get in.' By 2.46pm Mr Marshall described the scene as 'absolute bedlam'. Mr Marshall said he did not accept he had mistaken his description of fans pushing and shoving for involuntary surges in the crowd. Fans at Hillsborough spill out over the terraces during the 1989 tragedy . Victims of the disaster are stretchered across the pitch. Ninety-six people died in the tragedy . Liverpool players pictured leaving the field after the game was called off due to problems in the crowd . He repeated that it was 'a battle which we could not possibly win'. He said: 'We just did not have the numbers of police officers. Neither did we have the co-operation of fans at that stage at all.' Mr Marshall said he thought 'some of the fans were determined to enter the stadium come what may' - not all, he said, but 'a substantial minority'. He recalled a colleague outside the turnstiles urging him to open the exit gates but he was initially reluctant. He explained: 'Here we have got a very, very substantial minority under the influence of drink, pushing and shoving without any sort of mutual respect for anybody else, without any self-discipline and really determined to get into the stadium. 'I thought that, well, if we open the gates this substantial minority is going to end up inside the stadium... causing a public order issue. Some of them may not have had tickets, I don't know. An indeterminate number would not have had tickets. Certainly a minority of them had far too much to drink. A young Liverpool fan looks at tributes left at the Hillsborough 25th Anniversary Memorial Service in April . 'Close behind that was the absolute imperative of doing something about the situation outside because it was plain to me that unless I did something about it, people would be killed.' The barrister asked if he considered upon reflection that he had made mistakes before he climbed up the parapet of the bridge. Mr Marshall replied: 'Of course I made mistakes. I was in the present. I could not see into the future. 'I was doing my absolute utmost and very best to manage an increasingly deteriorating situation and as time progressed what options had I got left?' He added: 'As time progressed I am sorry to say that the co-operation (of the fans) was not evident. Neither was self-discipline. Neither was self-control. Neither was a mutual respect for anybody else and these are the sorts of things we value in this country.' Ms Lambert asked: 'Do you think you could have and should have done more?' Fans hold up scarves during the memorial service to mark the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough at Anfield stadium, in April this year . Mr Marshall replied: 'I think you can always say you could do more... I was in an unprecedented situation there. I was doing my absolute best. I was not standing around with my hands in my pockets. 'Disasters don't happen in my view because of one individual or a group of individuals have not done their best. Disasters happen because lots and lots of different factors all come together just at their own time and this is what we got, sadly.' Referring to his comments about Liverpool supporters, Pete Weatherby QC, representing some of the bereaved families,  said to the witness: 'I am not going to suggest to you that all of the supporters acted as though they were on some kind of church outing but your references to the behaviour of Liverpool fans are simply offloading responsibility, aren't they?' 'No,' replied the witness. The hearing continues today. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Senior police officer admits 'profound regrets' over Hillsborough tragedy .

"Pre-existing illness: Bill Oddie, 72, says he was forced out following an investigation into his behaviour during filming . Bill Oddie has claimed that the BBC ‘put him in hospital’ with crippling depression when it dropped him from Springwatch four and a half years ago. The presenter said his pre-existing illness reached a crisis point when the broadcaster unexpectedly sacked him from the popular wildlife series. Oddie, 72, says he was forced out following an investigation into his behaviour during filming. At the time, the BBC put his dismissal down to his health problems. Oddie had previously been diagnosed with clinical depression, a diagnosis that has since been amended to bipolar disorder, in which depressive episodes alternate with periods of manic activity. He suspects that his mood swings upset colleagues and members of the public during filming on location at Brownsea Island in Dorset. But he says he can’t understand the decision to fire him just before Christmas 2008, and that it plunged him into a despair which culminated in admission to London’s Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in March 2009. ‘They just said: “We won’t be asking you to do it again,”’ he told Radio Times. ‘And actually you’re so taken aback at that moment you don’t insist: “Why not?”’ That put me in hospital for a year, basically.’ The naturalist, who had worked on the programme since it was launched in 2005, later tried to find out why he had been treated in this way, but says the BBC only gave him ‘a waffly statement’ with no specific detail. He was replaced by presenter Chris Packham. He said the incident affected his whole family. His youngest daughter, Rosie, described seeing her father taken to hospital: ‘It wasn’t my dad. It was a shell of a human. My dad is full of life and love, but that person was crippled with self-doubt.’ Oddie spent much of that year in hospital, only being released in December. He has described the period as ‘probably the worst 12 months of my life’. After his diagnosis, he was prescribed lithium, which he still takes. He now feels ‘absolutely fine’. Shock: Oddie's youngest daughter, Rosie (left), said her father 'was a shell of a human' when taken to hospital . He added: ‘When I look back, I think during that autumn period I was on a high because I was very edgy and tetchy. Your ability to work long hours and think quickly and that sort of thing is usually heightened. ‘But one or two people said to me, “You know, you really intimidate people in the office,” and I said: “Why?” They’d say: “Well you know, you’re sort of brusque and impatient sometimes.” 'I never thought so, you know. I look back and I think, yeah, I guess I was.’ ‘I could well see that there was an autumn of mania going on and therefore I was probably giving signals out which I didn’t realise and, I imagine, signals were reported back. ‘I think somebody said the public complained I was swearing at a cameraman or a producer when we were on location somewhere in a shop.’ He is now returning to the BBC in a new six-part series, Britain’s Big Wildlife Revival, which will feature wildlife experts choosing a creature they want to protect for future generations.","Oddie: I was forced out following probe into my behaviour during filming .

"Fracking could cause powerful earthquakes capable of destroying buildings as the process of extracting gas weakens fault lines deep under ground, scientists have claimed. American geologists said that a domino effect of quakes could be caused by intense pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing, combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away. Columbia University scientists maintain that powerful earthquakes thousands of miles away can trigger swarms of minor quakes near waste water injection wells like those used for in oil and gas recovery. Geologists from Columbia University have claimed that a chain of earthquakes could be caused by pressure on fault lines from fracking, combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away. A shale fracking facility is pictured . They say a recent surge in U.S. oil and gas . production using vast amounts of water to crack open rocks . and release natural shale gas has been linked to an increase in small to moderate . induced earthquakes in five states. Seismologists from the university have identified three quakes - in Oklahoma, Colorado and Texas . that they believe were triggered at injection well sites by a major earthquake a long . distance away. The . discovery, published in the journal Science by one of the world's . leading seismology labs, threatens to make fracking even more . controversial, Reuters reported. Geologists have known for . 50 years that injecting fluid underground can increase pressure on . seismic faults and make them more likely to slip. The result is called . an 'induced' quake. Nicholas . van der Elst of Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New . York, who led the study, said: 'The fluids (in waste water injection . wells) are driving the faults to their tipping point'. He believes that as pressure from waste water wells stresses . nearby faults, if seismic waves speeding across Earth's surface hit the . fault it can rupture and months later, produce an earthquake stronger . than magnitude 5. The seismologist thinks that waste water injection leaves local faults 'critically loaded,' or on the verge of rupture. Shale gas has been hailed a possible ingredient in the UK's future energy mix (a map of reserves is pictured), but now U.S scientists have found the process uses 11 chemicals that can disrupt the body's hormones . Even . weak seismic waves arriving from faraway quakes are therefore enough to . set off a swarm of small quakes in a process called 'dynamic . triggering.' And once the tremors stop the danger is not necessarily over. Heather . Savage, co-author of the study warned that the swarm of quakes 'could . indicate that faults are becoming critically stressed and might soon . host a larger earthquake'. The seismologists believe that long distance triggering is most likely . where waste water wells have been operating for decades and where there . is little history of earthquake activity. Opponents of fracking fear that the process will release toxic chemicals into water supplies. John Armstrong, a spokesman for advocacy group New Yorkers Against Fracking, said that the new study should be 'a stark warning'. The study was funded by National Science Foundation and the US Geological Survey. However, many scientists have previously suggested that fracking will not lead to major earthquakes. Opponents of fracking (pictured) fear that the process will release toxic chemicals into water supplies. John Armstrong, a spokesman for advocacy group New Yorkers Against Fracking, said that the new study should be 'a stark warning' Geologist William Ellsworth of the US Geological Study, who was not involved in the study but is an expert on human-induced earthquakes, said that tremors that cannot be felt are routinely produced by fracking. The largest fracking-induced earthquake 'was magnitude 3.6, which is too small to pose a serious risk,' he write in Science. A previous study into fracking led by Professor Richard Davies from Durham University’s Energy Institute, said the risk of fracking resulting in seismic activity that could be felt on the surface is ‘not significant’. Talking about whether the process of extracting shale gas causes seismic actiivity itself, he said: ‘In almost all cases, the seismic events caused by hydraulic fracturing have been undetectable other than by geoscientists.’ ‘Most fracking-related events release a negligible amount of energy roughly equivalent to or even less than someone jumping off a ladder onto the floor.’ A joint UK study of hydraulic fracturing by The Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering said that fracking can be managed effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation. The experts also said that earth tremors induced by hydraulic fracturing are likely to be of a smaller magnitude than the UK naturally experiences or than is related to coal mining activities.","Scientists from Columbia University have claimed that earthquakes could be caused by pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing .

"Notts County striker Kwame Thomas was sent off in his team's goalless draw at Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday night - for walking off the pitch too slowly. Thomas, who is on loan from Derby County, was being replaced by Billy Daniels in the 87th minute at the Keepmoat Stadium but took his time leaving the field. It was not initially clear that referee Richard Clark had issued Thomas a second yellow card, leading to confusion on the touchline. Notts County striker Kwame Thomas looks back in astonishment after being shown a second yellow card for leaving the field too slowly late in their match at Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday night . Notts County manager Shaun Derry was sent to the stands for protesting after Thomas was dismissed . Daniels had already taken the field and had to be recalled to the bench and, in the subsequent arguments, County manager Shaun Derry was sent to the stands for protesting. The 10-men visitors then had to withstand a late Doncaster onslaught but held on for a point against their fellow League One play-off contenders. Derry's assistant Greg Abbott afterwards condemned the farcical end to the game, saying: 'I've never seen a sending-off like that. County player Billy Daniels (right) had to be called back to the bench after Thomas was sent off . The decision led to confusion and confrontation on the touchline at the Keepmoat Stadium . Derry argues with the fourth official after the farcical decision to send Thomas off . 'We couldn't put the sub on because you can't do that for somebody who has been sent off. The game could have done without it because it got a bit messy after that.' It appeared the official had forgotten he had already booked Thomas and Abbott had some sympathy. 'I think, to be fair, in defence of the referee, if he'd have realised it was his second one he would have rushed over and ushered him off without doing the card.' It was only Thomas's second appearance for the Magpies, having joined on loan from Derby last week.","Kwame Thomas shown second yellow card when he was subbed .

"A woman who has been imprisoned for more than 30 years for the 1976 murder of a 19-year-old nursing student is set to be released this week, now that another man has been connected to the crime with DNA evidence. Cathy Woods, 64, was being treated at the Louisiana State University Medical Center in 1976 when she confessed to killing Michele Mitchell. Mitchell was found dead near the University of Nevada's Reno campus on February 24, 1976 - her throat slashed shortly after her car broke down. Release: Cathy Woods, 64, is set to be released from prison this week as she awaits a retrial in the 1976 murder case of college student Michele Mitchell. DNA evidence now ties a man to the slaying. Pictured above in court yesterday . Confession: Woods (left) confessed to killing Mitchell (right) while being treated as a mental patient at the Louisiana State University Medical Center. Her public defender believes she only confessed in order to be deemed dangerous, and get a single bedroom at the mental hospital. Pictured above in court on September 8 . The psychiatric patient's public defender says she only admitted to the killing so that staff would think she was dangerous, and let her have her own room at the mental hospital. New suspect: Rodney L Halbower, an inmate in an Oregon penitentiary, recently submitted DNA evidence which now connects him to a cigarette butt found on Mitchell's dead body . 'I'm told it was a product of wanting to get a private room,' her public defender Maizie Pusich said. 'She was being told she wasn't sufficiently dangerous to qualify, and within a short period she was claiming she had killed a woman in Reno.' 'I suspect the reason why she thought of this case is because this was the case everybody around her was talking about. This is something she would have heard about many, many times,' Pusich added to SFGate. Recently obtained DNA evidence, however, links known Reno-area killer Rodney L Halbower to the crime. A judge accepted Woods' petition for a re-trial, and will be released this week to her family in Bakersfield to await her new court date, July 13, 2015. ‘We are delighted that Cathy gets to go home and we get to try to prove to the rest of the world she was innocent all along,’ Pusich said after the hearing. ‘It's a horribly sad situation but thank goodness today we are moving the right direction.’ Justice: Halbower was sent to prison not long after Mitchell's murder, the the rape of a blackjack dealer just a few blocks from where the nursing student's body was found . Innocnet girls: Veronica Cascio, 18, was snatched off the street while walking to a bus stop (left); Tanya Blackwell, 14, went missing while walking from her home, and her decomposed remains were discovered only six months later . Paula Baxter (left), 17, was abducted February 4, 1976, stabbed to death and had her head bashed in; Carol Lee Booth (right), a 26-year-old housewife, was discovered in a shallow grave . Left for dead: Saleswoman Denise Lampe was raped, murdered and dumped outside a busy shopping mall . Halbower, 66, only recently submitted a DNA sample after being transferred in 2013 to a prison in Oregon. That sample matches a cigarette butt that was found underneath Mitchell's body. 'No DNA found at the Michelle Mitchell crime scene belongs to Cathy Woods,' her lawyer said. The FBI said in a statement issued in San Francisco later Monday that Halbower had been named as a person of interest in the killings of five young women in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1976 known as the 'Gypsy Hill Murders.' Veronica Cascio, 18, was snatched off the street while walking to a bus stop at Bradford Way and Fairway Drive; her body was later found on the Sharp's Park Golf Course, Mercury News reported. Just weeks later, Tanya Blackwell, 14, went missing while walking from her home, and her badly decomposed remains were discovered only six months later off Gypsy Hill Road. Paula Baxter, 17, was abducted February 4, 1976, as she left a school play rehearsal. The high school student was stabbed to death and had her head bashed in. Carol Lee Booth, a 26-year-old housewife, was discovered in a shallow grave near Colma Creek in March, and the following month, saleswoman Denise Lampe was raped, murdered and dumped outside a busy shopping mall. Halbower was first sentenced to prison in Nevada for sexually assaulting a female blackjack dealer in downtown Reno in November 1975, an attack that occurred roughly two months before Mitchell was killed a few blocks away, Woods' Pusich said. He was later sentenced to two life terms for rape and other charges. Scene: Above, the house in Reno where Michell's body was found in 1976. The 19-year-old's throat was slashed shortly after her car broke down near the University of Nevada campus . He escaped from prison twice but was recaptured before being paroled in 2013 to begin serving sentences in Oregon. FBI spokesman Peter Hill disclosed in March that the DNA on the cigarette butt in Reno matched that of semen gathered from at least one crime scene in San Mateo, California, and that FBI agents had reopened the series of cold cases. Pusich said Monday the DNA found at two of those California rape-murder scenes also belonged to Halbower. Woods' brother, Al Carter, 58, told reporters with tears in his eyes after the hearing that he had heard there were other suspects in the 1976 killing. ‘I'm so happy,’ he said about the possibility of closure for his sister and the family of Mitchell. Woods was convicted of the murder in 1980, won an appeal before the Nevada Supreme Court but was convicted again in 1985. Carter said he had tried to maintain hope his sister would be freed eventually but was starting to fear she would end up dying in prison. ‘I've heard her talk about appeals forever, but she has talked about it for so long, I thought maybe that was her mental condition,’ he said. ‘It turns out, wow, she's right.’","Cathy Woods, 64, was convicted of killing University of Nevada student Michele Mitchell in 1976 .

"Stephen Crabb (pictured) has vowed to 'keep the spotlight on Labour's appalling record in Wales' The childhood memories of Tory Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb, the youngest member of the Cabinet, are rather different to those of David Cameron with his loving, stable family and the playing fields of Eton. Crabb’s mother Jacqui fled the family home in Wales with her three sons after one violent row too many with her husband, Crabb’s father. Crabb was just eight years old at the time. He was bullied at school because his mother couldn’t afford a uniform. And he played truant to go potato-picking to raise the cash to buy a pair of trainers. ‘One of my earliest memories is of getting between my mother and father as he came at her with a knife – terrifying,’ says Crabb, talking to me in his Westminster office. ‘There were other incidents when the police came around. My mother was basically living inside a prison suffering massive physical and emotional abuse. She literally scooped us up in her arms, we got on a train and went to Scotland.’ The promotion of Crabb, 41, to the Cabinet in July was not widely predicted. To put it bluntly, with only eight Welsh Conservative MPs, the Prime Minister’s choice was limited. Crabb’s elevation to the Cabinet was noted mainly for him being the only member with a beard – and for getting rid of his ministerial Jag to save money. The crisis in the Welsh NHS, run by the Welsh Assembly, is a golden opportunity for Crabb to make his mark as a national figure. As a county-level schoolboy rugby player, he does not intend to drop the ball. ‘We have been saying for ages that the Labour-run NHS is a shambles. They are slipping behind in education too, and that is what will happen in the rest of the UK if Ed Miliband wins power. I will keep the spotlight on Labour’s appalling record in Wales.’ ‘Crabbie’, as he is known at Westminster, is a Tory ‘boy next door’ version of Labour’s Andy Burnham – sporty, neat and mild-mannered, and, like Burnham, a bit too mild-mannered for some. But few MPs can match Crabb’s rise from a violent broken home and poverty in Labour-dominated Wales to a Tory seat at the Cabinet. He has had virtually no contact with his father, who is still alive, since the family left in a hurry, even though they still both live in the same part of Pembrokeshire. When, by chance, Crabb sees his father, they do not speak. ‘I have forgiven him now,’ he says. ‘Looking back, I can recognise some of the mental or psychological conditions, but as a child you don’t know about that. It leaves many scars, but you can’t hold on to baggage like that.’ On arrival in the shipbuilding town of Greenock near Glasgow, where his mother had fled to her parents’ two-bedroom council flat, Crabb and his brothers went to the local state school. They were the only ones with no uniform and were bullied for their ‘English accent’ (Crabb is from a part of Pembrokeshire known as ‘Little England Beyond Wales’). ‘I was in the town swimming baths and the lifeguard put his leg across the diving board ladder and said, “No English on here”.’ Mr Crabb pictured as a boy with his mother Jacqui . Life was little easier when the family returned to Wales after his mother found her feet. Crabb was always interested in politics. ‘I was the nine-year-old kid who made a scrapbook of the Falklands War,’ he laughs. But his mother’s ordeal opened his eyes to a more profound political awakening. ‘She went from a breakdown and welfare to standing on her own two feet. That’s why I am so passionate about our welfare reforms. She’s a living example of welfare to work.’ By contrast, he says his father was mostly unemployed. ‘Worklessness and dependency is a curse on the Welsh economy. Wales needs welfare reform more than anywhere else. But look who Labour are selecting for rock-solid safe seats. Not local youngsters but Neil Kinnock’s son, Stephen, the “Red Prince”. They don’t speak for the working poor or anyone else.’ It is a rare flash of venom. ‘When people talk about hard choices between heating or eating or buying clothes, I know what it’s like. I’m not saying we lived in poverty in a cave, but there were a few Christmases as kids when we relied on the kindness of friends and the church. ‘I hated having to queue up to be handed my plastic free meal token at my comp, Tasker Milward in Haverfordwest. I nicked off school to pick potatoes to buy stuff like trainers.’ It was the 1980s, time of the miners’ strike. Margaret Thatcher was a hate figure in much of Wales, but teenager Crabb became a fan. ‘Mum was talking to the neighbours about the discount on their council house from Thatcher’s right-to-buy scheme. Unless you’ve lived there you can’t appreciate how revolutionary it was for people who never thought they’d own their own home.’ Every Saturday morning, Crabb’s mother took her sons to the library, Saturday afternoons was for swimming, and on Sundays she ‘dragged’ them to church. ‘They’d take the p*** out of me at school, but I’m so grateful I went. I am a Christian and faith is important to me.’ Crabb was no goodie-two-shoes and played lead guitar in a rock band that played the Sex Pistols’ Anarchy In The UK, though he admits: ‘We were pretty crap.’ While friends spent gap years in sunny Thailand, Crabb spent his living in a tent in Newport on the muddy Bristol Channel to work as a labourer in the town’s docks. He met French wife Béatrice while studying at Bristol University. ‘She was beautiful, so far out of my league, I learned French…’ Mr Crabb pictured outside Number 10 Downing Street on July 15, the day he was promoted to the Cabinet . Just to have his wicked way with her? ‘To show her I was serious,’ he laughs. ‘One summer I got my final pay packet from a building site in Brighton, took the overnight ferry, got a train to Paris, slept on a park bench and made my way by bus and train to her home in the Ardeche in the South of France. She said “Oui”.’ The couple now have two children, aged 13 and ten. After working for charities and in marketing, Crabb became the MP for Preseli in Pembrokeshire in 2005. He knows his Cabinet break came partly because Cameron needs to play down the Tories’ silver-spoon image. Crabb puts it his own way: ‘If you can’t speak with authenticity to those with the least in society, you’ve no right to go up the driveways of those with more.’","Stephen Crabb recalls moment his father tried to attack mother with knife .

"The boss: Angela Ahrendts, CEO of Burberry, has topped the bluechip executive pay league taking home almost £5million more than her next big-earning counterparts . As a child, her home was so cramped she created a ‘bedroom’ for herself under the stairs. These days there are no such space issues for Angela Ahrendts, boss of British fashion house Burberry – after she became the first woman to top the City pay league. Indeed, the total package of £16.9million that the 53-year-old enjoyed last year would probably allow her to buy the tiny town in the US where she grew up. The mother-of-three, a committed Christian who reads the Bible every day, beat her closest rivals in the FTSE 100 index – all men – by nearly £5million. While her basic salary is around £1million, the largest chunk of her extraordinary windfall came from selling £11.9million of shares in the fashion giant built up over several years. The company, whose models currently include Cara Delevingne and David and Victoria Beckham’s son Romeo, insist Mrs Ahrendts is worth every penny, delivering ‘record revenue and profit’. Despite the global economic meltdown – which began shortly after she became boss in July 2006 – the share price has trebled under her stewardship. It is an extraordinary result for a woman who spent her childhood in the remote outpost of New Palestine, Indiana (population, around 2,000). One of six children, she often sewed her own clothes. The home was cramped, with the family of eight squeezed into four bedrooms. Her older sister, Carrie, once explained: ‘There wasn’t much privacy. So, when she was ten, Angela took over the little space below the stairwell, the place you put coats. She installed black lights and put in shelves, where she lit candles she’d hand-dipped. It was famous in the neighbourhood. Everyone came to see Angela’s place.’ Today she no longer has to resort to such Harry Potter-style conditions. Taking on her job at Burberry, she had to relocate her husband Gregg, 53, and their children – Jennings, 17, and daughters Sommer, 16, and Angelina, 12 –  from New York to London. The mother of thee, pictured right with Burberry's creative director Christopher Bailey, admits relying on loads of Diet Coke to get her through her busy days . Gregg, her childhood sweetheart from primary school, was forced to give up a successful construction business, though his expertise has proven useful in the extensive renovation of the couple’s large neo-Georgian manor house in the countryside, 20 minutes west of London. The couple have two Bernese Mountain dogs, Sonny and Rocker, who love to bound down the wide white marble steps of their 12,000 sq ft estate with an indoor pool and a tennis court. Items such as one of Burberry’s handbags are small change to Mrs Ahrendts. While The Orchard handbag in ‘python bridle leather’ is beyond the means of most women, she can more than cope with its £3,495 price tag. Branching out: Burberry's trench coat remains . the signature piece in the company's collection, but Angela Ahrendts CEO . has moved away from the traditional checks - autumn/winter 2013 . Just in case she doesn’t want to pay full price however, she can always use her 80 per cent discount or £25,000 Burberry clothing allowance. Mrs Ahrendts, a self-confessed Diet Coke addict, usurped Bob Diamond, the former chief executive of Barclays, once dubbed ‘the unacceptable face of banking’ in the pay league. Mr Diamond, who left the bank following the interest-rate fixing scandal last year, had won the top prize in the 2011 survey with a gold-plated package of £20.9million. The executive pay survey, which is conducted annually by the remuneration experts MM&K and Manifest, saw the average FTSE 100 chief executive enjoy a 10 per cent total pay rise to £4.25million. Mrs Ahrendts spent 20 years working her way up to the top in the fashion industry after gaining a merchandising and marketing degree from Ball State University. Angela Ahrendt is just one of three women in CEO positions at FTSE 100 companies - the others are Carolyn McCall, left, at easyjet, and Alison Cooper, right, at Imperial Tobacco . She did her time at less glamorous places like bra maker Warnaco and working-girl staple Liz Claiborne, where she spent eight years before moving to Britain. At one point she was working 80 hours a week. She is credited with ‘de-chavving’ Burberry, after its famous check had become popular with minor celebrities and football fans and was being widely counterfeited. It has subsequently been removed from the vast majority of the firm’s products. A Burberry spokesman said: ‘Under Angela’s leadership Burberry delivered record revenue and profit during 2011/12, building on a track record of performance which delivered £4billion of value to shareholders through share price growth and dividends in the five years to 2012.’ Mrs Ahrendts also donated 10 per cent of her salary to the Burberry Foundation, a charity, last year, as she has done in previous years.","Angela Ahrendts took home almost £5million more than the next highest earner .

"She was the fiercely loyal wife, standing by a husband branded America’s ‘most hated and most clueless man’. But now former BP boss Tony Hayward’s partner has called time on their 27-year marriage. Maureen Fulton has been granted a ‘quickie’ divorce, citing the 55-year-old oil chief’s ‘unreasonable behaviour’. The decree nisi came only months after Ms Fulton was reported to be leading the fightback  to restore her husband’s tattered reputation following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig disaster. Hated: Tony Hayward at a Washington inquiry with his wife (circled). Maureen Fulton has een granted a divorce citing the 55-year-old's 'unreasonable behaviour' The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico – the worst  in history – forced Mr Hayward out of his £4 million-a-year job as BP’s chief executive. His remark that ‘I would like my life back’ and pictures of him relaxing on his yacht at the peak of the uproar fuelled the campaign to oust him from his post. He even found himself on the wrong side of vitriolic attacks led by US President Barack Obama. It prompted Ms Fulton, a geophysicist by training, to start writing a book that year to defend her beleaguered husband. The 51-year-old refused to comment on her  reasons for seeking a divorce when asked at the family’s house near Sevenoaks, Kent. Disaster: Maureen Fulton was reported to be leading the fightback to restore her husband's tattered reputation following the Deepwater Horizon oil rig catastrophe (pictured) ‘I’d heard in the past of rumours that they were having problems but I haven’t heard about anyone else being involved,’ said one of her friends yesterday. ‘It’s not something she’d talk about –  they are both very private people.’ Mr Hayward did not contest his wife’s application for a decree nisi, which was granted in  50 seconds. The businessman’s acceptance of the grounds for the divorce meant that no details were given  in court about his behaviour. The marriage will officially be dissolved with  a decree absolute in six weeks. The Haywards married in Edinburgh in 1985, when the couple were both working in junior  positions at BP. My Hayward took up the post of chief executive of Mayfair-based Genel Energy, which is developing oil production in Kurdistan . She put her career on hold to bring up the  couple’s two children, Kieran, 22, and Tara, 18. Mr Hayward’s departure from BP was reportedly eased by a pension pot valued at £10.8 million – worth about £600,000 a year. He later took up the post of chief executive  of Mayfair-based Genel Energy, which is developing oil production in Kurdistan. When approached for a comment on his  marriage split, a spokeswoman for Genel Energy said that Mr Hayward would not be making any statement on the matter.","Maureen Fulton has been granted a divorce citing 'unreasonable behaviour'

"The woman who sparked a heated internet discussion after revealing her 'after' weight loss picture was rejected by Shape magazine is set to be featured after all. Brooke Birmingham, 28, from Quad Cities, Illinois, appeared on the Today show this morning with Shape editor-at-large Bahar Takhtehchian, who asserted that the entire incident was a 'misunderstanding' involving a freelance writer unfamiliar with the magazine's editorial policies. The pair revealed that not only will Brooke be featured in an upcoming issue - including the bikini picture in question - but she'll also join four other women in talking about the true realities of weight loss, and the effects it has on a woman's body. Scroll down for video . Success story: Brooke Birmingham, who sparked a heated internet discussion after revealing her 'after' weight loss picture was rejected by Shape magazine, is set to be featured after all . Sending the right message: The feature will include the bikini picture that started the controversy after it was apparently rejected because of how Brooke's stomach looked . 'We're here to say that we are celebrating people like Brooke,' explained Ms Takhtehchian. 'We are excited to make this into an impactful discussion about weight loss and the realities. We want to turn this into something positive so it makes a big impact.' And despite being initially offended by the magazine's rejection, Brooke said the miscommunication has been resolved and she is equally excited to be part of this important discussion. 'It was my intention to start a . conversation,' she said of her photo submission and subsequent blog post about the incident. 'We want to start a discussion because . truly, there is a journey after the weight-loss journey' 'I had no idea that it would come to this! It was important . to me because that is my body and I felt like I needed to put it out . there to show people what a real weight loss looks like.' Shape initially approached Brooke about featuring her after her blog came to their attention, but the 'after' photo she sent in was rejected because of the way her stomach looked. The writer handling her story sent her a message that read: 'My editors were hoping you could send over a different after photo... They are looking to include one with a shirt.' Perfect solution: 'We are excited to make this into an impactful discussion about weight loss and the realities. We want to turn this into something positive,' said Shape editor-at-large  Bahar Takhtehchian (right) 'Miscommunication': Ms Takhtehchian said the writer who asked Brooke for a picture with a T-shirt instead was a freelancer who 'unfortunately said there was an editorial policy that simply doesn't exist' 'I was hurt,' Brooke said on Today. 'I mean, I felt like my body wasn't good enough to be on their website when you log on and do see women in bikinis.' So she rebutted by refusing to be in the article at all, and by posting a blog entry that went viral. 'My body is real, not Photoshopped or hidden because I feel like I should be ashamed,' she wrote in her post. 'This is a body after losing 172lbs, a body that has done amazing things, and looks AMAZING in a freaking bikini. This is the type of body they should have featured because it can give people hope.' Ms Takhtehchian said she is excited to give Brooke - and other woman with the same weight loss experience - a voice. Before and after: Brooke responded to Shape's initial rejection with a blog post that went viral. 'This is a body after losing 172lbs, a body that has done amazing things, and looks AMAZING in a freaking bikini,' she wrote . New woman: In the upcoming Shape issue, Brooke will join four other women in revealing the true realities of weight loss, and the effects it has on a woman's body . 'We want to start a larger discussion . about what happens after you lose a significant amount of weight because, . truly, there is a journey after the weight-loss journey,' she said. It has not yet been revealed exactly when the issue featuring Brooke will be published. 'That is my body and I felt like I needed to put it out there to show people what real weight loss looks like' In Shape's original response to the outrage caused by Brooke's claims, the magazine insisted it was a miscommunication. 'This is a result of a misunderstanding with a freelance writer,' a spokesperson said. 'This does not represent Shape's editorial values and the comments made about Shape's ""editorial policy"" are absolutely untrue. 'Shape . prides itself on empowering and celebrating women like Brooke, and any . indication that we would not run the piece with the photo provided was . wrong, as we would have been proud to share her inspirational story.​'","Brooke Birmingham was offended when the writer handling her story asked for an 'after' photo with a T-shirt, instead of the bikini one she sent in .

"Mauricio Pochettino would be forgiven for having some concerns that the referee who started the Jose Mourinho ‘campaign’ eight weeks ago — when cautioning Cesc Fabregas for diving when he was clearly fouled — is taking charge of Sunday's League Cup final. It is Anthony Taylor’s first Chelsea match since he apologised to Chelsea for that. Taylor won’t be concerned as he steps out at Wembley but, however strong mentally he feels he is, there must be some level of trepidation at how he will react when (and not if) Chelsea have a penalty appeal.

Taylor is a good referee, sometimes a very good referee. Mentally he is very strong and has the use of a sports psychologist if he feels the need to refer to him. I hope that he is strong enough because Mourinho — the undoubted master of the dark arts — will have his players fully briefed to exploit any weakness. He believes that is fair game, particularly when silverware is at stake.

"The former Oregon State University who filmed a porn video in the school's library has launched a sugar daddy dating site for broke college girls. Kendra Sunderland, 19, of Corvallis, Oregon, writes on the site, called Date Broke College Girls, 'I created this site to match college girls like me who are struggling to pay for school and looking for a rich older boyfriend. Hopefully this will keep them from getting naked in the library and help them use it to study!' She also said she created the site to help women feel 'empowered' Scroll down for video . Kendra Sunderland (above) has launched a sugar daddy dating site . The site is called Date Broke College Girls (above) and she is hoping it will 'empower' women . Sunderland claims she is the first ;sugar baby' to manage a site . 'I wanted to create a place online where young women can feel empowered, and meet successful individuals that can help them during a very stressful and challenging time,' she said in an interview with Coed. 'I’m personally a member of the sugar dating community, and have seen the benefits these relationships provide a young woman firsthand. Everyone benefits from having a mentor that can help you navigate challenges, especially ones they’ve overcome themselves – like managing student debts and starting a career.' It is the also the first site of its kind to be run by a 'sugar baby.' This after Sunderland made a video last October for the site MyFreeCams, and in it was seen topless at times and also touching herself, all while students walked around her in the school library, completely unaware of the young woman's video. Then, in January, someone uploaded the video to the popular site PornHub, making Sunderland an instant celebrity in the adult film world as the video received close to 300,000 views in just a few days before being taken down. And while her parents may be upset and the young woman was cited with public indecency, Kendra is hoping the hype around her library escapades is just what she needs to launch a modelling career. Sunderland became well known for the porn video she shot at the Oregon State libray (above) in October . Sunderland (above) hopes that the hype around the video will help her to launch a modelling career . The idea to start doing videos on MyFreeCams, which features women doing live webcam shows in which they can make money as viewers tip them with virtual tokens they buy from the site, came after Sundelrand could not find a waitressing job near campus. She did her first webcam video in October, and in an hour had made $150 - and earned plenty of compliments. 'Working a minimum wage job, there’s people that are just mean to you when they’re having a crappy day,' she told the Daily News. 'On MyFreeCams, [users] had nothing but nice things to say. And I made way more than I would working any other job.' She started making videos regularly at her home while her roommates were out, including one in which she had sex with a former boyfriend, and then, at the suggestion of one of the site's users, decided to take her show to a public place. That is when she made the library video, which earned her $700 for about an hour, and within a few weeks she had made the decision to drop out of college and focus on making videos for the site. Then, in January, she was sitting in her room when she began getting a barrage of friend requests from 'frat boys,' and then, after checking the gossip app YikYak, learned that everyone was talking about the 'library girl.' Her mother also began receiving messages around that time as well, as concerned friends started asking about her daughter, and while there was some relief Sunderland explains when her mother learned she had just filmed a video and had not been hurt, the mother still told her daughter; 'This is just something you can learn a lesson from and move on.' That is not what Sunderland intends to do however, a decision that has now made her parents 'upset' she reveals, as the offers are not pouring in for the young woman, and she just completed her first professional photo shoot. One thing people will not be seeing Sunderland do anymore however is webcam shows on MyFreeCams - the site has now banned her for violating their guidelines with her library clip. She is also banned from the Oregon State campus and last week was arrested and cited with public indecency before being released. As for how the video made its way to PornHub, Sunderland says she has 'no clue.'","Kendra Sunderland, 19, of Corvallis, Oregon, filmed a webcam video in the Oregon State library in which she was topless and touching herself .

"High Desert bunker killer: Collin Lee McGlaughlin, 24, will spend the rest of his life in jail over the 2008 murder of high school sweethearts in an abandoned Army dugout . A 24-year-old man obsessed with 'killing people at random' will spend the rest of his life in jail over the abduction and execution-style murder of a teenage couple in an abandoned Army bunker six years ago. Collin Lee McGlaughlin was yesterday handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole after making a plea deal in December to avoid execution. In a case which horrified Californians, McGlaughlin pleaded . guilty to forcing high school sweethearts Christopher Cody Thomson, 18, and Bodhisattva 'Bodhi' Sherzer-Potter, 16, into a desert bunker near Barstow before shooting them dead on January 5, 2008. The victims' families welcomed the sentence in court yesterday, which was handed down after they had delivered emotionally-charged impact statements. 'Collin McGlaughlin...you took my . son, but let me tell you what you did not take: You did not take my . memories, you did not take the things that made him what he was,' Pamela Thompson, Christopher's mother, said. 'He had everything you never had. And he was . everything you’ll never be, He’ll always be a better man than you, even . dead.' Bodhi's mother, Lorraine . Sherzer, said her daughter would have likely graduated from film school if she was still alive and would now be making movies, The Sun reported. 'There is no more laughter down the hall . or constant phone calls or text messages, no more arguments of ‘Are you . serious, Bodhi? Are you really going to wear that?' she said. 'There will be . no high school or college graduations, no wedding dress, flowers or what . colors to choose. I will never see her children or hold my . granddaughter. The day she died the world went gray.' Innocent victims: Young couple Bodhisattva Sherzer Potter, 16 (left) and Christopher Cody Thomson, 18 were sleeping inside their vehicle when Collin McGlaughlin and David Brian Smith forced them out at gunpoint and took them to a bunker where they were shot . In love: Victims Cody Thompson, 18, and Bodhisattva 'Bodhi' Sherzer-Potter, 16, met in film school at the Lewis Center for Educational Research, a prestigious charter school in Apple Valley, California . McGlaughlin, however, did not act alone: two other men, 25-year-old David Brian Smith, and 22-year-old Cameron Thomson, were also allegedly involved. The devastating crime unfolded in the early hours of January 5, 2008, as Christopher and Bodhi, standout students at the Academy for Academic Excellence, slept in their Jeep. They spent the night in their car after attending a party in the bunker in the High Desert. The were parked near the bunker, an abandoned military installation covered in graffiti which was a popular teen hangout. The victims' friends later told investigators that McGlaughlin, then 18, Smith, 19, and Thomson, 16, rocked up to the party in a Honda Odyssey van and asked if they could join. They brought a bottle of raspberry-flavored Bacardi which they handed around. It was when the party dispersed that McGlaughlin, the son of a retired Los Angeles Unified School District police officer, announced the plan to his two young friends. According to testimony, McGlaughlin ordered that Thomson stay in the van and act as a lookout. McGlaughlin and Smith, who was allegedly holding a gun, banged on the windows of the Jeep - the last car at the party - and forced the sleeping couple out of the vehicle at gunpoint about 4am . They marched the young lovers, half-dressed and barefoot, into the bunker, ordering them to drop to their knees, The Press-Enterprise reported. The bunker: The ruins of the World War II airfield and subsequent radio relay station for the military has since been demolished . McGlaughlin killed the pair in an execution-style shooting, however prosecutors believe the autopsy report suggests Smith may have fired at least one of the . shots, Daily Press reports. McGlaughlin later bragged in jail that he had killed a pair of high school sweethearts and said shooting someone was 'a hell of an adrenaline rush'. McGlaughlin and Smith were charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder, . kidnapping and robbery. Smith pleaded not guilty to the charges and still awaits trial. Thomson pleaded guilty in March 2011 to two counts of voluntary manslaughter. The bunker - the ruins of a World War II airfield and subsequent radio relay station for the military - has since been demolished. Court transcripts reveal Collin McGlaughlin (pictured) was feared in the years, and especially days, leading up to the January 5, 2008, murders, with his father reportedly locking up his own guns to keep his son from getting to them . Defendants: Cameron Thomson (left) and David Brian Smith (right) were also allegedly involved in the brutal 2008 double murder . In 2009, McGlaughlin pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. But two years later, a jury found the . dramatically slimmed-down man mentally competent to stand trial despite . claims by the defense that he was schizophrenic. His mother, Lynda McGlaughlin, yesterday said she was sorry the victims' families felt the way they did toward her son and her family. 'There . weren’t any winners,' she said. 'They portrayed Collin as a . monster. Others know differently. And I’m hoping we could move on.' While McGlaughlin said in a pre-sentencing hearing he was 'not proud' of his crimes, it was reported at the time of the incident that McGlaughlin was deeply troubled. Grieving: Leah Sherzer, center, holds a photograph of her daughter Bodhisattva 'Bodhi' Sherzer-Potter during the sentencing hearing for Collin McGlaughlin on Friday in Victorville, California . McGlaughlin was considered a 'ticking timebomb' who was . feared - including by his own family - leading up to the attack. His . father allegedly locked up his guns in case his son tried to access . them, while McGlaughlin's friends allegedly called him 'psychotic'. Redlands Daily Facts has provided a chilling profile of McGlaughlin, who was raised in a highly dysfunctional household. According to the publication, McGlaughlin had been prescribed myriad medications to stabilize his mood swings and diagnosed with multiple psychological disorders beginning at age five. In his teens, he began sharing with friends his dark fantasies around mass murder and mayhem. By the time of his arrest for the 'bunker killings', McGlaughlin had attended seven different schools, done stints in two boys homes and in juvenile hall and had been admitted to the hospital twice for psychiatric evaluation. McGlaughlin kept a chilling MySpace.com blog with photos of himself brandishing a shotgun and pistol, Los Angeles Times reported. He called himself an 'Equal Opertunity (sic) Merchant of Death' who listed 10 things he believed. At the top, he wrote: 'I entered this world screaming and covered in someone else's blood and thats how I intend to leave it (sic)'. He had also written on an internet blogging site about 'killing people at random', however police said he had no clear motive for the 2008 double homicide.","Collin Lee McGlaughlin sentenced over the 2008 kidnap and murder of Cody Thompson, 18, and Bodhisattva 'Bodhi' Sherzer-Potter, 16 .

"Indian King of England: DNA tests show Prince William is of Indian descent . DNA testing has revealed that Prince William will become the first British monarch of Indian ancestry. A clear genetic line has been drawn between the Duke of Cambridge and a half-Indian woman, potentially marking him as the first King whose bloodline is descended from the country. Analysis of saliva samples on relatives of Prince William revealed the link between the second in line to the throne and a distant relative from his mother’s family. The revelation will prompt calls for the 30-year-old prince to make his maiden visit to India, following in the footsteps of his parents who travelled there in 1992. The genetic link with India is believed to originate from Williams’s great-great-great-great-great grandmother Eliza Kewark. Although often described as Armenian, DNA analysis has revealed that she was at least half-Indian and is known to have lived in the country’s western region. Scottish scientists established the link after discovering that Eliza’s descendants carried a rare strand of DNA - known as mitochondrial DNA - which can only be passed on by a mother. Only people from the Indian subcontinent have been found to carry the particular strand of DNA. It has been recorded in 14 other people - all Indian, apart from one Nepalese native. The DNA is thought to have been passed down to Prince William and his brother Harry, as the scientist behind the research described the genetic link as ‘unassailable’. The tests were carried out by genetics expert Jim Wilson, from the University of Edinburgh and a group called BritainsDNA, who said that the princes would be unable to pass the DNA to their children. A clear genetic line has been drawn between the Duke of Cambridge and Eliza Kewark, who was at least half-Indian and is known to have lived in the country's western region . From mother to son: The DNA has been passed down from Diana's side of the family from Prince William's great-great-great-great-great grandmother Eliza Kewark who was half-Indian . It has not been revealed which relations of William supplied the saliva samples to allow the DNA to be tested. Princess Diana’s maternal aunt Mary Roach . told The Times: ‘I always assumed that I was part-Armenian so I am . delighted that I also have an Indian background.’ Kewark was married to Scotsman Theodore Forbes, who left his wife and sent their daughter, Katherine, to live in Britain aged six. Letters sent from Kewark to her estranged husband were discovered by researchers in which she begged to be able to see her children again. Princess Diana pictured at the Taj Mahal (left) and wearing a garland (right) during her visit to India, in 1992 . First and last: The DNA will not be passed on to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's child as the mitochondrial DNA is linked to the mother's side . The communication suggests that Forbes . turned his back on his wife, potentially due to her race, referring to . her as his ‘housekeeper’ in his will after he died returning to Britain . on a ship in 1820. He also described her as the ‘purported mother’ of Katherine. Mitochondrial DNA, also known as the Eve Gene, is inherited solely from the mother in most species, including humans. Tracing the gene has become an important tool in anthropology and field biology as it allows scientists to study links between populations. It is believed to have evolved separately from nuclear DNA, deriving from the circular genomes of bacteria engulfed by the early ancestors of the modern-day eukaryotic cells. According to the Bradshaw Foundation, it is believed by some molecular biologists that at one stage the mitochondrion was a free-living organism with its own DNA. They say it also held the key for generating lots of energy. It then invaded single-celled nucleated organisms and has remained ever since. While males cannot pass the DNA on to their children, they do receive and use their mother's mitochondrial DNA. If the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do decide to make a state visit to the country after the expected birth of the couple’s baby in July, the second in line to the throne will hope that their experience is more harmonious than his parents. Princess Diana was famously pictured sitting alone outside the Taj Mahal, an Indian landmark regarded as symbol of love, without her husband in sight. His direct genetic lineage could be seized upon by Buckingham Palace as a way of boosting the British monarchy’s popularity in the country. Alistair Moffat, the founder of BritainsDNA, said: ‘Knowing something about your DNA and its origins in prehistory definitely changes your sense of yourself, and one way that it does that is to make you feel part of a world community.’ Historian Alistair Moffat told . MailOnline how before India became a part of the British Empire in the . mid-19th century, it was governed by the East India Company, who . employed armies and generals and even fought wars, including Robert . Clive's famous campaign against the French which culminated in the . victory at Plassey. Mr Moffat said: 'When Henry Dundas . became Governor General of the East India Company, he began to appoint . more and more Scots to important positions. 'When Theodore Forbes came to Leith . to work, he probably came into contact with the tea merchants who . brought tea to Britain in the tea clippers, the wonderful sailing ships. Perhaps the Cutty Sark is the best known. Princess Diana was famously pictured sitting alone outside the Taj Mahal, an Indian landmark regarded as symbol of love, during the visit to the country . The Prince of Wales receives the traditional southern Indian greeting of a Tilak on the forehead from Mres Sayyavati, mother of the Governor of Andhra Pradesh, as they visit him at the start of the last full day of his and Diana's visit to the country . 'Scottish entrepreneurs had invested so heavily in the Indian tea industry that it outstripped production in China. 'As the third son of a Scottish . landowner, Forbes needed to make his fortune elsewhere and like many . ambitious young men, he went to India to do just that. 'When Forbes arrived in the Bombay . Presidency he employed a housekeeper, Eliza Kewark. They had three . children, one of whom, Catherine or Kitty, was the ancestress of . Princess Diana.' The wedding of Ruth Sylvia Gill and Edmund Burke Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy, at St Devenick's Church, Bieldside, Scotland . Prince William's Indian ancestry can be traced back through his family tree which reveals his genetic link with Eliza Kewark. Kewark had three children with Theodore Forbes after he arrived in India, working for the East India Company. One of their children, Katherine, became a well-respected member of society in Scotland and married James Crombie, a member of the family that manufactured the coats of the same name, in Aberdeen, in March 1837. The pair had eight children including Jane Crombie, who was born in November 8, 1843, and married David Littlejohn. Their daughter, Ruth Littlejohn, was born in 1879, who married Colonel William Smith Gill in 1898. Ruth Littlejophn then gave birth to Ruth Sylvia Gill eight years after the turn of the century, who lived until July 6, 1993. She became styled as Baroness Fermony after she married Edmund Burke Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy, in September 1931. She . held the office of Justice of the Peace between June 1956 and March . 1960, before she became the Woman of the Bedchamber to HM Queen Elizabeth . The Queen Mother, and was invested as a Dame Commander, Royal Victorian . Order, in 1966. Among her children was Princess Diana's mother, the Hon Frances Burke Roche, born on January 20, 1936, in Sandringham, Norfolk.

"Appeal: Omid Djalili, pictured leaving the Old Bailey, had a six month driving ban overturned . Comedian Omid Djalili had a driving ban quashed by an Old Bailey judge today after a police blunder over his insurance. Djalili, 47, was caught illegally . using a cycle lane to undertake cars on his moped and police officers . thought the number of points on his licence rendered his insurance . policy invalid. The comedian was fined £2,900 and banned for six months by City of London Magistrates’ Court last September for driving without insurance. But the Gladiator and Pirates of the Caribbean star launched an appeal against the charge of driving without insurance, which prosecutors did not contest, and his conviction was today overturned. The judge, Mr Recorder Brian O’Neill QC, sitting with two lay magistrates, told the comedian: ‘That is the end of the matter.’ Djalili, who was allowed to sit behind his barrister in the well of the court for the 30-second hearing, replied: ‘Thank you, My Lord.’ The judge also ordered Djalili’s defence costs be reimbursed.

Djalili did not appeal the £200 fine for riding in a cycle lane - only the conviction for driving without insurance. Police believed his insurance was invalid and impounded the moped and it took Djalili two weeks to get it back. During the original magistrates’ court hearing, the entertainer asked to be spared a ban. He said: ‘I have found myself being harassed and recognised on public transport. ‘If I don’t stop and take a picture with someone it can get abusive, which is distressing. ‘I also suffer terrible nausea on tour buses and let my crew go ahead and I follow in my car and my wife has a nervous disorder, which prevents her driving.’ Chelsea-born Djalili, whose parents are Iranian, added: ‘There is also a security issue. 'Coming from the Middle East and not being a Muslim I’ve had death threats and have always felt more secure when I am driving.’ Djalili, of East Sheen, southwest London, was cleared of driving a motor vehicle without insurance.

"New planning minister Nick Boles is facing accusations of hypocrisy after details of his 'Green Belt' upbringing emerged yesterday . New planning minister Nick Boles is facing accusations of hypocrisy after details of his ‘Green Belt’ upbringing emerged yesterday. Mr Boles has launched a scathing attack on countryside campaigners accusing them of being ‘hysterical scaremongering latter-day Luddites’. But the 46-year-old, whose father is a former director general of the National Trust, grew up in a string of idyllic countryside locations. A close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Boles has been charged with overhauling planning laws to boost the economy – a move which campaigners fear is a massive threat to the Green Belt. He has a track record as a radical thinker who wants to slash red tape to boost the economy and refuses to say that the Green Belt is ‘sacrosanct’. In a speech to the influential Tory Reform Group this year, he attacked a campaign led by the National Trust against the Government’s planning revamp. Last weekend Mr Osborne raised the prospect that developers could build on Green Belt land, provided other areas of land were designated for protection. Opponents say Mr Boles has ‘a mission to pave the entire country in concrete from Newcastle to Newquay’. But his stance on planning is a far cry from his own upbringing where he enjoyed living in some of our most beautiful countryside locations. The MP’s home in the rural constituency of Grantham and Stamford is a beautiful 19th century cottage which looks out over acres of Lincolnshire fields and woods. For the past 30 years, his father Sir Jack Boles – head of the National Trust between 1975 and 1983 – and his stepmother Anne have lived in a Grade II listed home in a West Country hamlet. The minister's idyllic home overlooks acres of Lincolnshire fields and woods . Nick Boles' father's house in East Devon, where the MP spent his childhood . The imposing two-storey house, which dates back to 1822, looks over fields and lanes of East Devon. Mr Boles would have enjoyed the . home’s idyllic setting during his teenage years at fee-paying Winchester . College and while studying at Magdalen College, Oxford. As a younger boy, Mr Boles’ family home was in picturesque Englefield, near Reading. Sir Jack himself enjoys rural life to the full acting as a church warden and beekeeping. The former National Trust director has refused to comment on his son’s outburst against countryside campaigners. In a speech to the Tory Reform Group this year, Mr Boles said: ‘Business investment is deterred by the bureaucratic rigidity of our outdated planning regime. ‘So it is essential that we press on with our planning reforms and do not allow the hysterical scaremongering of latter-day Luddites to strangle developments that will boost living standards.’ Mr Boles told BBC2's Newsnight programme that ministers would protect the Green Belt - but warned that large areas of 'open land' may have to be given over for housing . Residents are to lose the right to object to broadband ‘street cabinets’ that have caused dozens of planning rows. New . Culture Secretary Maria Miller argued that speeding up the availability . of ‘superfast’ broadband to all was essential to Britain’s economic . future. Under . her plans, broadband cabinets – typically 5ft high – and other . infrastructure can be installed without the need for prior approval from . the local council, except in sites of special scientific interest. On BBC2’s Newsnight on Thursday, Mr Boles twice refused to say whether he felt the Green Belt was ‘sacrosanct’. Pressed on the subject by presenter Kirsty Wark, he added: ‘There are currently flexibilities in the regime that many local authorities don’t understand… . 'What we are trying to remind them is that in exceptional circumstances they can slightly change the boundaries of their Green Belt.’ Ministers have launched a string of initiatives this week ranging from state guarantees for housebuilding to relaxation on planning requirements for home extensions in an effort to stimulate a flagging economy. But John Hoad, head of planning for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘The idea that constant change to the system, more centralist control through Government planning inspectors, or planning holidays on domestic and commercial extensions will help growth is misguided. ‘These are invitations to development with no affordable housing or infrastructure and deeply damaging Green Belt land swaps.’ Nick Boles has paid more than £2,000 to charity following criticism of his decision to take taxpayer-funded lessons in Hebrew . The Hebrew lesson fees he's paying back... Nick Boles has paid more than £2,000 to charity following criticism of his decision to take taxpayer-funded lessons in Hebrew. Last month it was revealed that the MP had spent £678.80 on the classes after entering into a civil partnership with Israeli partner Shay Meshulam. Mr Boles maintained he was ‘entitled’ to learn the language, saying it was a service available to MPs. He then added with a tone of closure: ‘I’ve done it… and that’s that.’ But the disclosure caused fury in his Lincolnshire constituency and in the pages of his local newspaper, the Grantham Journal. In a surprise move, Mr Boles has now said he will not claim for any future  classes – and will make a donation to charity to cover the cost of those already taken. In a column for the paper, he wrote that he had checked with the authorities who regulate the use of the language service and they confirmed his decision to take the lessons was ‘entirely proper’. He said he worked closely with the British Israel Communications and Research Centre and meets regularly with senior members of the Israeli government when they visit London. However, he said that he wanted to be ‘frugal with taxpayers’ money’ and ‘recognised’ that some people felt it was wrong for him to use taxpayers’ money to learn a language which would also benefit him personally – even though his partner speaks fluent English. He said he had decided to make donations totalling £2,115 – ‘the total cost of my Hebrew lessons last year and this to three local charities’. He added he would pay for any future lessons. Mr Boles met Mr Meshulam on a Conservative Friends of Israel trip. He is not the first MP to put language lessons on expenses. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt charged taxpayers over £3,000 to learn Mandarin after marrying a Chinese woman.","Boles attacked National Trust call to stop planning laws revamp .

"Puppy love: Beatrice with pet dog Max . Princess Beatrice's pet dog Max has been attacked by the Queen's corgis, it was claimed last night. The 11-year-old terrier nearly lost an ear and suffered horrific bites during the fight at Balmoral a week ago, according to a source. It comes just days after another of Beatrice's family dogs, Millie, died of natural causes. The fight is believed to have started after the Queen's six dogs were taken for a walk with the York family's three Norfolk terriers last Sunday. The Queen owns three corgis, called Monty, Holly, Willow, and three dorgis – a dachshund and corgi cross – named Cider, Candy and Vulcan. A source reportedly said: 'It was really nasty. The Queen's dog boy was taking the corgis for a walk and they were joined by the Norfolk terriers, which came [to Balmoral] with Prince Andrew. 'They were being taken along the long corridor leading to the Tower Door before being let into the grounds for a walk and they all became over-excited. 'They began fighting among themselves and unfortunately the dog boy lost control. 'The next thing we knew there were horrific yelps and screams, and it seems the corgis picked on Max.' The source added that there was 'blood everywhere', and that the dog was 'very badly injured' and needed to be taken to the local vet. 'The Queen and duke were very upset when they were told but the dog is really Beatrice's and she wasn't there either,' the source said. 'She later came up to Scotland and has been looking after Max. He was very lucky to survive. Beloved: The Queen with her corgis beside her and Prince Philip at Balmoral in 1994 . Beloved: The Queen with her corgis beside her and Prince Philip at Balmoral in 1994 . 'I heard the princess was very upset because another of her Norfolk terriers, Millie, died from natural causes just a week or so before.' The 24-year-old has doted on Max since she was given him as a Christmas present when she was 13. The dog featured on the Duchess of York's 2005 Christmas card and also appeared on a £450 handbag, which she carried to the Royal Family's Easter service at St George's Chapel in 2004. Max went missing from the Duke of York's home in Windsor Great Park in December 2008, prompting Beatrice to lead a search by torchlight. It is understood that her mother, the Duchess of York, sister Eugenie and even the Queen lent a helping hand. After three weeks, Max turned up looking bedraggled and hungry. 'Nasty' incident: Queen Elizabeth is greeted by local corgi enthusiasts in Edmonton, Canada, in 2005 . A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment about the alleged dog fight. Meanwhile, Prince Harry was spotted partying in Las Vegas with a group of friends following a holiday in the US. The third in line to the throne was seen at one of the city's infamous pool parties, which was also attended by singer and actress Jennifer Lopez. The prince was reportedly seen chatting to several girls dressed in bikinis at the alcohol-fuelled 'Wet Republic' party, which was held at the MGM Grand Hotel on the city's main strip. Harry, wearing shorts, a white panama-style hat and sunglasses, and his friends were also seen jumping in the pool and playing with an inflatable toy whale. An onlooker said: 'They even had a blow-up whale in their area and were just fooling around and joking and having some drinks and just enjoying themselves.' The prince was also seen trying his luck at the tables in the upmarket Wynn resort.","Max, an 11 year-old Norfolk terrier, was badly injured .

"Italy’s star midfielder is running scared at the prospect of facing England at the World Cup in Brazil and has sought solace with the team priest. Andrea Pirlo has had crisis meetings with squad pastor Don Massimiliano Gabricci amid concerns over his ability to perform on Saturday. He has bared his soul over the break-up of his marriage with Deborah Roversi – after getting close to blonde Valentina Baldini, who he met at his golf club.

The midfield pass-master fears his tangled private life could have an impact on his performances on the pitch. Pirlo, 35, terrorised England in the Euro 2012 Championships and any crisis of confidence could be good news for Roy Hodgson's men ahead of their World Cup opener on Saturday night in Manaus. At training camp in Florence, Pirlo and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who has recently separated from model wife Alena Seredova, were Don Massimiliano’s top priorities. He also attempted to soothe the anxieties of forward Alessio Cerci, who wept on the pitch after missing a crucial penalty in the final match of the Serie A season. He told Italian TV Rai Sport: 'I consoled Cerci on Sunday evening. He is an emotional and sensitive guy, he should not feel ashamed of his mistake. 'This is life, this is football. It’s a pity, but he will do great things at the World Cup.' The team's spiritual father, a close friend of coach Cesare Prandelli, officiated at a special team mass and held a ceremony of blessing for the squad before they left for Brazil.

"Clashes have escalated in eastern Ukraine after dozens of rebel fighters surrounded and stormed the separatist headquarters in Donetsk, in the most serious case of insurgent infighting seen so far. Pro-Russian forces from the Vostok Battalion broke through the regional government building and demanded activists from the so-called People's Republic of Donetsk - which was set up in April - leave the premises. The insurgents then arrested members of the rival group, before removing their flags from check-points in the area. Scroll down for videos . Members of the Vostok Battalion, a pro-Russia militia, today surrounded separatist headquarters in the eastern Ukrainian . city of Donetsk,  in what is believed to be the most serious case of insurgent infighting to date . The standoff was allegedly started amid reports of looting from a supermarket near the airport, which the Vostok Battalion allege was carried out by their allies. The supermarket was near to the site where dozens of militiamen - mainly from the Vostok Battalion - were killed on Monday. Today's confrontation ended with the militiamen seizing the looted goods and . bulldozing the barricades that have lined the building since the People's Republic was created. The latest clashes come after a Ukrainian military helicopter was shot . down by rebels over Slovyansk earlier today, killing 14 troops on board, . including a general. Pro-Russian forces removed flags of other separatist groups from the . barricades outside the Donetsk regional administration building, where the so-called People's Republic of Donetsk has been based since April . The forces moved the flags after surrounding and storming the building, in a bid to eject the group from the premises, amid rumours of looting at a supermarket near the airport on Monday . Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov told . the parliament in Kiev that insurgents used a portable air defense . missile to down the helicopter. He said: 'I have just received . information that terrorists using Russian anti-aircraft missiles shot . down our helicopter near Slovyansk. It had been ferrying servicemen for a change of duty.' Turchynov said army General Serhiy Kulchytskiy was among the dead. The Interfax news agency said . Kulchytskiy had once served in the Soviet army and was in charge of . combat training for Ukraine's National Guards. Members of the Vostok Battalion were seen escorting activists from the People's Republic out from the government building . The rebel fighters stood guard in front of local residents as they prepared to storm the government building . The standoff was said to be the result of alleged looting from a supermarket near the airport, which the Vostok Battalion say was carried out by their allies . Gunshots . were heard in Slovyansk near the crash site and a Ukrainian air force . jet was seen circling above. It was too dangerous to visit the site . itself. Turchynov said . the helicopter was flying troops in for a rotation to a hill outside . Slovyansk where Ukrainian forces have set up positions. An insurgent fighter from the Vostok Battalion is shown looking at items . that the group believed were looted by other separatist groups and . stored in the Donestsk regional administration building . The confrontation ended with the militiamen seizing the allegedly looted . goods and bulldozing the barricades that have lined the building since . early April, when the People's Republic announced its formation . A separatist spokesman had earlier . told Russian news agencies that the militants had downed the helicopter . in a fierce battle that was still raging on the southern outskirts of . the rebel-controlled city. The unnamed spokesman said that 'as a result of active military activities, several houses belonging to civilians caught fire'. The . death toll is one of the highest suffered by Ukrainian forces since the . separatist insurgency first erupted in eastern Ukraine in early April.

'Terrorist act': It was not immediately clear what weapons the rebels used to shoot down the helicopter, exactly where it fell or what happened to its crew. Pictured is a file image of a Ukrainian helicopter gunship . The downing of the Mi-8 helicopter is a major blow for Kiev whose new president Petro Poroshenko is to be inaugurated within days. He plans a first meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the D-Day commemorations in Normandy on June 6. But he is also to demand military protection from the U.S. and major European states, in a move that - if accepted - risks pulling the West into conflict with Russia. General Serhiy Kulchytskiy, who was killed when a Ukrainian helicopter was shot down by rebels over Slovyansk . Poroshenko said he could no longer trust Russia, adding: 'We need a new defence alliance with the United States and Europe to protect Ukraine militarily'. It also emerged that 33 men killed in bloody battles in Donetsk were Russian citizens, giving backing to Ukraine's claims that Moscow's blatant interference is fuelling the conflict. Ukraine premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk said the 'escalating' unrest would stop immediately if Russia stopped supporting the rebels. 'If Russia stays out, we will resolve the east Ukraine situation within a week or two,' he said. 'So far, tensions are escalating in the Ukrainian east,' Yatsenyuk stressed. Russia called on the West  'to stop Ukraine from descending into a national disaster' with one report saying the flare-up in trouble had delayed Russian troop redeployment from border areas, with intelligence-gathering units remaining in place. 'The international community awaits from Kiev an immediate ceasing of military activities in the east of the country and the withdrawal of troops. Without that, achieving peace in Ukraine is impossible.' Moscow claimed the Ukraine onslaught counted children and the elderly among its victims. Russia expressed 'deep concern over the further escalation of the situation in eastern Ukraine'. Slovyansk has become the epicentre of fighting between pro-Russia insurgents and government forces in recent weeks. The . city, located 100 miles west of the Russian border, has seen constant . clashes and its residential areas have regularly come under mortar . shelling from government forces, prompting some residents to flee. The Kiev government condemns the . insurgency roiling the east as the work of 'terrorists' bent on . destroying the country and blames Russia for fomenting it.

Still, . fighters from Russia, including the battled-hardened region of . Chechnya, have been appearing recently in the ranks of the separatists. In Donetsk, another embattled city in the east, pro-Russian rebels have reportedly executed two people for looting after declaring martial law. Separatist . gunmen from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic have imposed a . strict curfew in the city as both the insurgents and civilians braced . themselves for a full-scale government assault.

Ponomarev, the self-proclaimed 'people's mayor' of Slovyansk, a city in . the Donetsk region, insisted the observers from the Organisation for . Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) were safe.

'They were most zealous': Vyacheslav Ponomarev, the self-proclaimed 'people's mayor' of Slovyansk, said his fighters are holding four international monitors but said they might be set free soon . The OSCE said it had lost contact with one of its four-man monitoring teams in Donetsk on Monday evening. Rebels have previously kidnapped OSCE monitors in Ukraine. Ponomarev . said that his men had advised OSCE monitors not to travel across the . region, but 'there were those four most-zealous ones, and they were . detained.' The OSCE . monitors have been deployed to Ukraine to monitor the security situation . following Russia's annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russia separatist . insurgency that has engulfed regions in eastern Ukraine. They also observed Sunday's presidential vote, won by billionaire candy magnate Poroshenko. Poroshenko has promised to negotiate with people in the east, where insurgents have seized government buildings and fought government troops for a month-and-half. But he also vowed to continue a military operation to uproot the armed rebels and bring it to a quick end. In the most furious battle yet, rebels in Donetsk tried to take control of its airport Monday, but were repelled by Ukrainian forces using combat jets and helicopter gunships. Dozens of men were killed and some morgues were overflowing Tuesday. Some insurgent leaders said up to 100 fighters may have been killed.","Insurgent fighters turned against each other as clashes in Ukraine escalated .

"Ominous prediction: Mr Juncker stopped short of saying that war was on the horizon but added, 'The demons haven't been banished, they are merely sleeping' One of Europe’s most prominent statesmen has warned that resentment of Germany across the continent is so high that war remained a danger. Jean Claude Juncker, a long-time president of the European Council, painted an ominous portrait of Europe, claiming there ‘chilling’ parallels in 2013 with 100 years ago – the eve of the First World War. He said the eurozone crisis had exposed long-standing tensions between countries. Mr Juncker, 58, who is also prime minister of Luxembourg, stopped short of saying that war was on the horizon but warned: ‘The demons haven’t been banished; they are merely sleeping.’ Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, he said, remind us of that and he said he was 'chilled by the realization of how similar circumstances in Europe in 2013 are to those of 100 years ago.' In June 1914 the heir-apparent of the Austrian-Hungarian empire, Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated along with his wife in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, setting in motion the political and military alliances which dragged Europe into the greatest war ever seen. By the end of it, three empires - including that which Ferdinand was to inherit - had vanished and ten million soldiers were dead, the continent ruined and exhausted with the way clear for the Nazis to come to power in Germany. Now with Europe wracked in a financial crisis seemingly without end, in which societies are being pushed to the brink as the middle classes are squeezed, Mr Juncker says he is shocked by the rise of nationalist sentiments seen in countries like Greece and Italy, both hurting under severe austerity measures. He said he was deeply upset by the way . German politicians 'lashed out' at Greece as it went broke, adding; 'I . was just as shocked by the banners of protesters in Athens that showed . the German chancellor in a Nazi uniform. Assassination: In June 1914 the heir-apparent of the Austrian-Hungarian empire, Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated along with his wife in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo (pictured moments before the attack), setting in motion the political and military alliances which dragged Europe into the greatest war ever seen . Over the top: By the end of the war, three empires had vanished and ten million soldiers were dead, the continent ruined and exhausted with the way clear for the Nazis to come to power in Germany . 'Sentiments suddenly surfaced that we thought had been finally relegated to the past. The Italian election was also excessively anti-German and thus un-European. 'Anyone who believes that the eternal issue of war and peace in Europe has been permanently laid to rest could be making a monumental error.' In an interview with Germany's Spiegel Magazine he said the continent wasn't yet manning the barricades, but added; 'I see obvious parallels with regard to people's complacency. In 1913, many people believed that they would never again be a war in Europe. Anti-German sentiment: Juncker said he was shocked to see Greek protesters dressed as Nazis during anti-austerity demonstrations last year . 'The great powers of the Continent were economically so strongly intermeshed that there was the widespread opinion that they could simply no longer afford to engage in military conflicts. 'Primarily in Western and Northern Europe, there was a complete sense of complacency based on the assumption that peace had been secured forever.' He said only a united Europe was a safe and strong Europe. 'A united Europe is our Continent's only chance to avoid falling off the world's radar,' he added. 'The heads of government of Germany, France and the United Kingdom also know that their voice is only heard internationally because they speak through the megaphone of the European Union.' Mr Juncker, who will campaign again next year to be the leader of his country once more, said he is backing Germany's conservative chancellor Angela Merkel in her bid for a third term of office in the general election in the autumn.","Jean-Claude Juncker: 'WW1 demons are not banished'

"The mayor of an Irish town was forced to resign last night after provoking outrage by declaring he would no longer represent Africans from his constituency. Darren Scully, who is also a councillor for Ireland's centre-right political party Fine Gael, apologised for stating he found ‘black Africans’ to be aggressive and bad-mannered after he caused widespread fury. However, the former Mayor of Naas faces being jailed or fined for the outburst after an official complaint was made to Republic of Ireland's police force, known as gardaí. Former mayor: Darren Scully has resigned after provoking outrage by declaring he would no longer represent Africans from his constituency . Politicians and anti-racism groups had demanded Mr Scully’s expulsion, while a Labour MP has reported the father of two’s remarks to gardaí under the Incitement to Hatred Act. ‘I realise now that my remarks were open to an interpretation that I did not intend,’ Mr Scully said in a statement. ‘I abhor racism in all its forms. I have been proud to be mayor of Naas and to represent all the people of the town. However, as a result of the upset that I have caused, I feel it is appropriate that I step down from this position.’ If convicted by gardaí, Mr Scully could face six months to two years in jail or fines ranging from €1,000 to €10,000. He made the controversial remarks live on the town's Kildare radio station KFM yesterday morning. Darren Scully in fancy dress wtih a model . Criticising the manner in which black Africans asked for his help in getting on social housing lists, Mr Scully said he would no longer deal with them. ‘I have been met with aggressiveness, I have been met with bad manners,’ he said during the radio interview. ‘I have also been played the race card. ‘[They’ve] said: “Oh yeah you’ll help white people, but you don’t help black people.”’ He added: ‘So after a while of this... I’ve been doing this now for six or seven years – I just made the decision, a conscious decision, earlier this year, that I just was not going to, myself personally, was not going to take on representations from black Africans. ‘I would be very courteous to them and I would pass on their queries to other representatives, who would take their concerns.’ Politicians, equality organisations and minorities support groups all rushed to condemn the comments. Fine Gael had issued a statement within an hour distancing themselves from his comments and promising that there would be a formal investigation at party level. ‘The views expressed by Cllr Scully do not reflect the views of Fine Gael, and they are not party policy,’ the statement read. ‘Fine Gael is an inclusive party and we are trying to build a country that caters for all.’ Former Labour MP Moosajee Bhamjee warned yesterday that comments such as those by Mr Scully would represent the ‘beginning of official racism’ in Ireland. The country’s first Muslim MP, who served as a MP for Clare from 1992 to 1997, warned that such comments from a Government party councillor could lead to official State racism if left unchecked. ‘This is really, really frightening because it could be the beginning of State racism in this country,’ Dr Bhamjee said. ‘There is a small neo-Nazi following in this country you know, and this just adds to what they see as enlightenment. It’s important now more than ever that our racism laws be strengthened.’ Schoolboy David Agboala is reluctant to play with Scully and Enda Kenny on the 2007 campaign trail . The psychiatrist said he had been abused in the past himself and he called on the Government to introduce a new paper on racism as the law is clearly deficient in this area. And even though Mr Scully resigned as mayor last night, Dr Bhamjee believes he should also be expelled from Fine Gael. ‘I’ve been abused myself in the past too, people feel they’re entitled to, but the law of the land says no. ‘Cllr Scully is still a public representative, he should be expelled from Fine Gael after this and I’m calling for that.’ The association campaigning for equality in sport, Show Racism The Red Card, was appalled by the comments and said it was clearly discrimination. ‘The qualification for Mr Scully’s comments that “I am not racist” is bizarre,’ Show Racism the Red Card co-ordinator Garrett Mullan said. ‘There cannot be an acceptance of racism within politics in Ireland.’ Sue Conlan, chief executive of the Irish Refugee Council, said: ‘Negative stereotypes create racism, and as we saw earlier this week when a Nigerian taxi driver was assaulted, this can lead to violence. ‘We all have a role to play in counteracting negative stereotypes and our elected officials have a special role to play in promoting tolerance and inclusion throughout the community. Cllr Scully’s comments are outrageous and not worthy of an elected representative.’ Catherine Murphy, an Independent MP for Mr Scully’s constituency, Kildare North, said the remarks were ‘outrageous’ and ‘totally unacceptable’. She described as ‘unfathomable’ the reasons why he felt the need to make such a statement. ‘While listening to Kildare FM this morning I could scarcely believe what I was hearing. ‘It’s right and proper that Cllr Scully step down as Mayor of Naas immediately and I welcome his decision to do so. ‘However, it’s essential that if he remains as a public representative he must undertake to represent all of the people, without qualification or prejudice.’ Taxi driver Ola Akinsete, who is originally from Nigeria, met Mr Scully last month after he drove him home to Kerdiff Park in Naas. The 44-year-old, who has lived in Naas since 2000, said: ‘The racial issue in Naas is becoming so bad for the past three years – it’s becoming an epidemic. But it’s a big shock to me to hear him say those comments as a young man, it’s unbelievable. ‘What’s happening in Naas are discussions about what the black community is doing to the town. For instance, some people say we are taking their jobs and taking over the place. This should not be the attitude of some of the public. We are in a different century. ‘I came to Ireland for a better life but now my wife, Kate, and I just make sure our children are safe and have a better upbringing. ‘If this situation continues, how are my children able to live in a country where they have been brought up with such racial issues?’","Centre-right political party Fine Gael issued a statement within an hour of his comments, distancing themselves from their councillor .

"Historically, tallying votes has proven to be a challenging task for the state of Florida - and this year's Miss Florida pageant was no exception. Last week's pageant in St. Petersburg culminated with the crowing of 20-year-old Elizabeth Fechtel as 2014's Miss Florida, which means she was to be the state's representative in this year's Miss America pageant. Fechtel then reportedly dropped out of school at the University of Florida to 'prepare' for the upcoming Miss America pageant in September. However, she may want to consider re-enrolling because she will not be competing in this year's pageant - after crowing her Miss Florida, pageant officials determined that there had been a scoring error and Fechtel didn't actually win. Denied:  Miss Florida officials realized Elizabeth Fechtel's victory was due to a vote-tallying error and she was stripped of the crown . The true winner, pageant organizers determined, was Victoria Cowen, who had been named runner-up at the June 21, crowning. 'It was determined there was an error in the tabulation process that . results in Elizabeth Fechtel being named as Miss Florida 2014.

Cowen was told she was the winner about midnight on Thursday. She then drove roughly 300 miles from her home in Panama City to retrieve her crown in St. Petersburg on Friday. 'I'm overwhelmed,' Cowen said. 'I'm speechless. I'm beyond every imaginable emotion right now.' Miss Florida: A week after Fechtel was crowned Miss Florida, pageant officials realized they had tallied the votes wrong and the real winner was Victoria Cowen (pictured) Fechtel also was told about the error on Thursday - but only after she'd spent the last several days going on a media tour, speaking with her hometown media outlets and writing a lengthy 'thank you' note on her Facebook page, in which she said the honor of being crowned Miss Florida was 'life changing.' Fechtel was obviously upset with the outcome but kept things classy and called Cowen to congratulate her on her win - the two women are friends who have competed in several pageants together, according to Tampabay.com. Fechtel has not commented on the loss of the crown, but her mother issued a statement to friends, family and media outlets. 'Please give Elizabeth and our family some time to process this information in light of the fact that in these last five days, Elizabeth has dropped out of college, as required, and re-arranged her life to be Miss Florida instead of a UF college student, pursuing the title with vigor! We apologize for any plans you have made based on her being Miss Florida, as we have done so also,' Dixie Fechtel wrote in the statement. History: Florida has a bit of a history of not being very good at voting, most notably, the 2000 presidential election . Her father, former Florida legislator Vince Fechtel, also weighed in. 'Just like me and her mother, she was extremely upset, for a lot of . different reasons,' Vince Fechtel said. ""We were very concerned that it . be clear that Elizabeth did nothing wrong, absolutely nothing, and she . had spent all this time working. We were very distraught.'","Elizabeth Fechtel was crowned Miss Florida on June 21 .

"Mascara is the most important item in our makeup bags, followed by eyeliner . Even if you go for high street names rather than high-end designer brands, the cost of your average basic make-up bag still adds to nearly £100. According to a new study, the typical woman’s ‘everyday’ makeup bag in the UK contains 14 items; with mascara, eye liner and concealer the most prevalent products, and the most common brand names being Rimmel, Maybeline and Clinique. The research also revealed that the average makeup bag contains items worth approximately £93.32 in total. The study polled 2,104 adult women from around the UK, and found the typical number of items that women keep in their ‘everyday’ makeup bag was 14. Respondents were  asked to name the brands that could currently be found in their makeup bag, which revealed the following top ten most popular appearing in makeup bags across the UK, with Rimmel leading the way with 42 per cent, followed by Maybelline (39 per cent) and Clinique (38 per cent). The study then asked those taking part, ‘How much do you think the makeup in your ‘everyday’ makeup bag is collectively worth?’ which revealed the average response to be £93.32, with over half of women (52 per cent) saying they replenished their collection with new products every three weeks. Revealing just how much women rely psychologically on their makeup to give them confidence, 28 per cent of women said they would ‘never’ go out without their makeup with them, and just 19 per cent said they  ‘frequently’ did so. The research also revealed that the average makeup bag contains items worth approximately £93.32 in total . 1. Mascara – 74% . 2. Eyeliner – 71% . 3. Concealer – 66% . 4. Blusher – 63% . 5.

Matthew Wood of vouchercloud, who conducted the study, said: ‘It does seem that there’s an element of uniformity though according to our poll. Some things are clearly regarded as more essential than others. ‘The collective value is also a bit of an eye opener. Although individual items may seem inexpensive, it appears that the total soon adds up once you put them all together. ‘Looking good doesn’t come cheap it would seem, but we always encourage people to look for makeup discounts wherever possible as there are always deals to be had.’ However, if you think the average makeup bag is costly, the value of the entire handbag will leave you gasping.

"The so-called 'tiger mom' has been the subject of massive debate over parenting methods. However, researchers at Stanford say they have finally solved the problem of which is the best parenting method. They claim that in fact both methods are equally as effective. Motivation, the researchers wrote, is understood to come from within an individual in Western families, while Asian children find strength in parental expectations. In 2011, Yale law Professor Amy Chua (pictured) provoked a cultural clash with a Wall Street Journal article, 'Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior,' that advocated a strict approach – 'tiger parenting' – common in East Asia. The article suggested Western-style parenting was too permissive. In the backlash to the article, critics accused Chua of over-controlling her children in her quest to make them succeed. Stanford researchers Alyssa Fu and Hazel Markus suggest in a new study, both culture-centric approaches can be effective. Motivation, the researchers wrote, is understood to come from within an individual in Western families, while Asian children find strength in parental expectations. The bottom line is that children can be motivated either way, they say. 'These findings underscore the importance of understanding cultural variation in how people construe themselves and their relationships to others. 'While European American parents give their children wings to fly on their own, Asian American parents provide a constant wind beneath their children's wings,' wrote Fu, a doctoral student in psychology and the lead author of the study, and Markus, a professor of psychology. The debate was sparked in 2011, when Yale law Professor Amy Chua provoked a cultural clash with a Wall Street Journal article, 'Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior,' that advocated a strict approach – 'tiger parenting' – common in East Asia. The article suggested Western-style parenting was too permissive. In the backlash to the article, critics accused Chua of over-controlling her children in her quest to make them succeed. In the Asian American family model, the authors suggest, children learn the value of being interdependent with one's close others, especially one's mother. In contrast, European American families tend to emphasize that the person is and should be independent, even from one's mother. The focus is on developing self-esteem and self-efficacy in the child. 'We were interested in finding out how interdependence could be a motivating factor,' said Fu, who is is presenting the research at the annual convention for the Association for Psychological Science in San Francisco. 'The idea was to compare the Asian American cultural context to the European American one.' In four separate studies involving 342 students from a Northern California high school, students were asked for open-ended descriptions of their mothers. They also answered questions about how connected they felt with their mothers, as well as how much pressure they received. In two of the experiments, they examined how Asian American and European American students thought about their moms after they experienced failure in a word puzzle task that required them to think about themselves and others who are close to them. The research findings suggest that Asian Americans and European Americans see mothers differently. European families tend to emphasize that the person is and should be independent, even from one's mother. For example, Asian American high schoolers were more likely to talk about their relationships with their mothers than were European Americans. Asian Americans more often noted that their moms helped them with homework or pushed them to succeed. On the other hand, European American students were more apt to talk about their mothers as separate individuals – describing their appearance or their hobbies, for example. One defining trait of 'Tiger Moms,' Fu said, is that they do not simply give orders to their kids without getting involved. 'Tiger Moms throw themselves into everything that their children are doing,' she said. 'And when Asian American kids see themselves as really connected with their mothers, they can benefit from their mother's pressure.'","Motivation found  to come from within an individual in Western families .

"Russia has revealed it will develop an array of new weapons - including nuclear warheads - amid the escalating stand-off with the West over its involvement in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin revealed the move after Nato set up a 'spearhead' force to defend eastern Europe against what it describes as growing evidence of a Russian presence in Ukraine. He told a Kremlin meeting western nations should not get 'hysterical' about the re-arming, insisting the prospect of Russia entering a Cold War style arms race was 'absolutely excluded'. Scroll down for video . Tension: Vladimir Putin, pictured at a Moscow church today, has vowed to ramp up Russia's nuclear arsenal . Overrun: Ukraine and the West say pro-Russian rebels, like the one pictured today in the key city of Donetsk, have been receiving support from Russia and more than 1,000 Russian troops have been on Ukrainian soil . But he said U.S. missile defence plans had challenged Russia's security and his nation would rise to defend itself if necessary. In the speech - made on the same day Russia's military successfully test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile from a nuclear submarine - he said: 'We have warned many times that we would have to take corresponding countermeasures to ensure our security. 'I would like to underline that we only take retaliatory steps.' The statement appeared to signal that the Russian leader is determined to pursue a tough course in the face of more Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. Relations between Russia and the West have plummeted to their lowest point since the Cold War after eastern Ukraine, where many people are ethnically Russian, was overrun by pro-Russian rebels. Conflict: A pro-Russian fighter beside a burnt-out Ukrainian military truck today in Alovaisk, Ukraine . Toll: A boy beside a damaged wall in Alovaisk. The conflict has raged for five months and killed 3,000 people . There have been repeated claims - denied by Putin - that Russia is encouraging the unrest in order to allow an invasion in the guise of a humanitarian mission. The European Union is mulling a new wave of sanctions against Russia, intended to persuade it to honour its part of a cease-fire agreement signed last week. Moscow denies sending troops into eastern Ukraine, but leaders in the capital Kiev and Western backers say there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. At one point Nato estimated there were 1,000 Russian troops on Ukrainian soil. Today Ukraine's president said Russia had removed '70 per cent' of its forces from his country, raising hopes for peace after a five-month conflict which has killed more than 3,000 people. President Petro Poroshenko said parts of the east under rebel control would get special status under a peace deal. Presidential duties: Putin also cast his vote today in the Moscow City Duma elections, pictured . Standing guard: Ukrainian forces (pictured) have been battling pro-Russian rebels in the east for months . 'According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70 percent of Russian troops have been moved back across the border,' he said. 'This further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects.' He added 700 Ukrainian prisoners had been freed from rebel captivity and expressed hope that another 500 would be freed by the end of the week. But he said the ceasefire was not easy to maintain because 'terrorists' were constantly trying to provoke Kiev's forces. In today's speech, which addressed Russia's weapons modernisation programme from 2016 to 2025, Putin said the military had to replace Soviet weapons approaching the end of their useful lifespan. He said the country should focus on building a new array of offensive weapons to provide a 'guaranteed nuclear deterrent'. The plans also involve re-arming strategic and long-range aviation; creating an aerospace defence system and developing high-precision non-nuclear weapons. In charge: Pro-Russian rebels smoking as they guard Donetsk airport, which was overrun earlier this year . Refugees: A displaced family from Donetsk today on the outskirts of the southern coastal town Mariupol . He would not elaborate on the type of weapons, but he and other officials have repeatedly boasted about new Russian nuclear missiles' capability to penetrate any prospective missile shield. The Kremlin's current modernisation programme, to 2020, is already costing £330billion. Russia inherited most of its arsenal from the Soviet Union and has struggled to develop new weapons systems after the post-Soviet industrial meltdown. The difficulties faced by the Russian arms industry have been highlighted by the long and painful development of the Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile, which suffered repeated launch failures. But its designers finally seem to have cured the glitches, and the navy boasted of a successful launch of the Bulava from a nuclear submarine today. Talking about potential threats, the Russian president specifically pointed at the U.S. missile defense program and Washington's plans to develop new conventional weapons that could strike targets anywhere in the world in as little as an hour with deadly precision.","President revealed move today amid stand-off between Kremlin and West .

"Activists dumped $2000 in dollar bills onto a U.S. Senate office floor on Thursday and tossed the cash around, declaring it ‘Monsanto money!’ Occupy Monsanto, a group that supports the labeling of genetically modified foods, says that lobbyists for the agriculture giant are continuing to line the pockets of Congress members despite the shutdown. ‘The government is shut down, but you still have Monsanto lobbyists engaging with congress members,’ said activist Ariel. ‘We're here today to say that's not OK. Money shouldn't dictate how Congress makes decisions.’ Scroll down for video . 'Government is shut down, but you still have Monsanto lobbyists engaging with congressmembers!': Protestors from the group Occupy Monsanto showered the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill with a sack of 2,000 $1 bills . 'Monsanto money!': The activists gave out dubious 'Monsanto Minion' awards to congressmembers they say have a suspicious relationship with the controversial agricultural giant . Three were arrested during the protest, during which activists made ‘money angels’ in the piles of cash. ‘Nothing like a day on Capitol Hill lobbying - throwing money around- and getting arrested for it—WTF?’ tweeted Elizabeth Croyden, one of the activists hauled away by Capitol police on charges of crowding, obstructing and incommoding. The activists wore wigs and business suits as the entered the Hart building around 1pm and posed as lobbyists from the Biotechnology Industry Awards Committee, reported the Huffington Post. The group went to various other offices of members of congress to distribute their Monsanto Minion awards to lawmakers they believe are too friendly with Monsanto, before ending the protest by making it rain dollar bills. 'We're here today to say that's not OK. Money shouldn't dictate how Congress makes decisions': The activists were protesting Monsanto, but also lobbying in general, which continues--while in a smaller way--despite the shutdown . According to Capitol police, the three arrested activists included Adam Eidinger (left) and Elisheva Shalom (right) Elizabeth Croydon was also named as a one of the arrested activists. 'Nothing like a day on Capitol Hill lobbying - throwing money around- and getting arrested for it,' she joked on Twitter . They also gave Senators Mark Udall of Colorado and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts the award for introducing GMO food labeling legislation the group believes is too weak. ‘We want the federal government to enact a mandatory labeling law,’ activist Alexis Baden-Mayer, political director of the Organic Consumers Association, told the Huffington Post. Arrested with Croydon, say the Capitol Police, were Elisheva Shalom and Adam Eidinger. ‘Today was off the hoof for kicking off #MarchAgainstMonsanto this weekend,’ Eidinger tweeted Thursday evening. Starting in the Eighties, Monsanto began to genetically alter corn to withstand its herbicide Roundup, so that weeds but be eradicated but not crops. Since then, the company has become a biotech and agricultural giant, and many believe the company’s products are unhealthy and its business practices unfair. Regardless, there is fairly widespread acceptance of genetically modified foods in the U.S. But more specific labeling of such products is slowly increasing. Whole Foods Market, for example, announced this March that by 2018 everything it sells in the U.S. and Canada will be labeled to show genetically modified organisms.","Capitol police arrested three protestors in the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill Thursday afternoon .

"Lance Armstrong has admitted that he would still be lying about doping if a federal investigation had never found him out. The disgraced cyclist, who used performance-enhancing drugs to cheat his way to a record seven successive Tour de France titles after recovering from cancer, said that his lies would still be spiralling if the truth had not been uncovered two years ago. He told CNN in a phone interview: 'Once you say ""no"" you have to keep saying ""no"". If this stuff hadn’t taken place with the federal investigation, I’d probably still be saying ""no"" with the same conviction and tone as before. But that gig is up.' Scroll down for video . 'I'd probably still be saying ""no""': Lance Armstrong has admitted that he would still be lying about doping if he had not been found out by a federal investigation in 2012 . He went on to say that he would not has confessed even to his children: 'Well, that’s a conversation for my kids. But there was a lot of stuff in that lie, not simply me saying, ""no"". I couldn’t change the story.' Armstrong is serving a lifetime ban from sport, and said he is surprised at how he is able to go about his daily life without being taunted or heckled for what he did. 'I never get crap, not once, and I'm surprised by that,' he said. 'Sure, I sometimes get the vibe that someone wants to say something but it's never happened.' A cancer survivor and once hero to millions, Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after it accused him in a report of engineering one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sporting history. Toughing it up: He admits to having an 'f-you' attitude, but the disgraced cyclist insists he 'never gets crap' from people following his long-awaited admission of long-term doping . The investigation and later admission to doping destroyed Armstrong's reputation and career. He admitted that he has to accept that he has lost all credibility from the revelations. 'I don’t blame anyone for thinking, ""I don’t trust this guy with all his bulls*** for ten years"",' he said. However, he still feels harshly done by in his punishments when compared with other riders who have also been caught doping. 'I think most people are smart enough to say: ""That doesn’t make any sense"",' he said. 'What stands out in a lot of people’s minds is that we all know what happened in those other years, but those [results] still stand.' Armstrong and his team of lawyers are about to face several civil lawsuits that could drain his huge fortune. Bleak outlook: There's no hope of him ever riding competitively again and he is facing civil lawsuits to the tune of tens of millions of dollars . In June a federal judge rejected Armstrong's bid to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit claiming that he and his former cycling team, which the U.S. Postal Service had sponsored, defrauded the government in a scheme to use banned, performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong claims the U.S. Postal Service benefited hugely from the exposure it got from its sponsorship and that the lawsuit had been brought too late. The lawsuit has potential $100 million ramifications for a man who was previously one of the world's wealthiest sports stars. 'I'm very confident that that`s a winner for us,' said Armstrong. 'I don't think anyone can truly argue the U.S. Postal Service was damaged. 'They made a lot of money in the deal and got what they bargained for. 'I worked my ass off for them and I'm proud of it. Furthermore there wasn't a technical relationship between myself and the U.S. Postal Service.' Reboot: Armstrong hopes to restart his charity work, undergo a course of therapy and says he is planning on writing a book where he will 'put it all out there' Armstrong has said he now plans to write another book, which unlike his last effort, 'It's Not About the Bike', will be totally honest. 'I need to write a book and it needs to be pretty raw. I need to put it out there and let it sit. The sooner the better. It has to be the right book, the right tone and there has to be totally no b-s,' he said. He added that he sees writing as a kind of therapy that will help see him through the next few years, and that he is 'fully committed to putting it all out there.' Asked about seeking actual therapy, the 42-year-old said: 'My therapy is riding my bike, playing golf and having a beer. I haven’t gotten around to it. I get it totally, but it’s not something that’s taken place yet.' Armstrong relishes a good fight, and claims it is this spirit that made him the cyclist he was. 'I definitely have an 'f-you' attitude,' he said. 'I fight in training, I fight to win races, I fight to motivate the guys in the team.' The list of those he hurt, and who won't forgive him, is long: three-time Tour winner Greg LeMond, journalist David Walsh, who spent more than a decade trying to expose Armstrong, and former friends Frankie and Betsy Andreu, are just a few. A number have asked whether his public mea culpa on Oprah was genuine and if he needs to do more. 'That's a difficult one for me to answer,' he said. 'You can't do justice in a one-hour conversation. It was a situation for a lot of people that it was too much information, but for other people - cycling fans, sports fans, for other parts of the population - it wasn't enough, I didn't go far enough.'","Drugs cheat admits that he would not have stopped if not for investigation .

"A Libyan delegate sparked outrage after telling a United Nations human rights panel that gay people threaten the future of the human race. The unnamed official made the remarks as violence based on sexual orientation was being discussed. His outburst came despite the new Libyan leaders promising to respect human rights following the downfall of Colonel Gaddafi. Outburst: Libya were only reinstated to the 47-nation United Nations Human Rights Council in November. It is separate from the General Assembly . Libya were only recently restored to the 47-nations UN Human Rights Council. The delegate said that the topics being discussed 'affect religion and the continuation and reproduction of . the human race', the non-governmental organisation UN Watch reported. He also claimed that Libya would have opposed a resolution that denounced violence on the grounds of sexual orientation last June, if they had not been suspended. The homophobic remarks sparked an angry backlash and an immediate rebuke from the UN Human Rights council president Laura Dupuy Lasserre. Abuses: Under Colonel Gaddafi gays were routinely imprisoned in Libya . She said: 'The Human Rights Council is here to defend human rights and prevent discrimination.' Hillel Neuer, executive director of . UN Watch who led a campaign to have Gaddafi's Libya thrown off the . council said following the remarks: 'This is not the Arab Spring we hoped for.' Mr Neuer added: 'The homophobic outburst . by the new Libyan government, together with its routine abuse of . prisoners and other ongoing violations, underscores the serious . questions many have about the new regime's commitment to improving on . the dark record of its predecessor.' Libya were thrown off the Human Rights Council in March last year but allowed back on in November after the death of Gaddafi. While the dictator was in power, gays were routinely flogged and imprisoned, human rights experts have claimed.

"They have described themselves as the 'Spice Girls' of their day - the 'lily white' Maids of Honour chosen to accompany the Queen on her Coronation Day. Lady Rosemary Spencer-Churchill, Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Lady Anne Coke, Lady Mary Baillie-Hamilton, Lady Moyra Hamilton and Lady Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby were chosen for their 'decorative' beauty as well as their ability to carry the Queen's heavy train. All six were reunited at Westminster Abbey today to celebrate sixty years since that momentous day. The Queen on her Coronation Day in 1953, accompanied by the six women who now call themselves 'The Queen's Spice Girls' According to Lady Anne Glenconner - then lady Anne Coke -  behind the pomp, preparations for one of the most iconic events in modern history were a joyfully chaotic affair. The then 20-year-old daughter of the Earl of Leicester, was a vivacious socialite who described the Maids as the 'Spice Girls of our day' and explained each were chosen because of their lineage - the girls had to be the daughter of an Earl, Marquess or Duke - and be unmarried. 'We also had to have a certain type of look and figure. Put it this way, we wouldn't have got picked if we were fat!' she laughed . According to Lady Glenconner there was barely any time to rehearse - and never in the Abbey itself. 'We had a few run-throughs with the Duchess of Norfolk, who actually walked quite differently from the Queen - she walked much faster and we had to really pick up our pace in a hurry when we got to the Abbey. In the end we had just one rehearsal with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, where she wore some kind of curtain wrapped around her waist to mimic her heavy robes,' she recalled. Lady Anne Glenconner, left, and Lady Jane Rayne, right, arrives at Westminster Abbey today for a service to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the Coronation Service . The night before the Coronation - which was held on June 2 1953 - the capital was so packed that Lady Glenconner had to sleep on a mattress on her great-uncle's floor. 'I don't think many people would have imagined that,' she said. She added: 'On the morning we had our hair and make-up done because the event was being televised for the first time, but my hair was a disaster. 'I had just had a perm done and they put these heated rollers in my hair. I was frazzled and looked like a sheep and was awfully upset. Fortunately the hairdresser got to work and made me look half decent. 'We dressed at Buckingham Palace. Like the Queen our dresses were by Normal Hartnell, but while they looked exquisite they were the most horribly uncomfortable things to wear and absolutely crushed our ribs. We were told to keep wriggling out toes to try and keep the circulation going.' Lady Rosemary Muir, left, and Lady Mary Russell and Lady Jane Willoughby, right, entering Westminster Abbey . Lady Moyra Campbell was one of the Queen's maids of honour at the 1953 Coronation . Four of the more junior maids, including Lady Glenconner, headed to Westminster Abbey head of the Queen's arrival in the Gold State Coach. 'It was so exciting and we could hear the crowd roaring as the Queen approached. As she alighted we helped her out and smoothed her train. It was really quite cumbersome but had six invisible silk handles stitched into it. 'I must say she looked quite ravishing, the dress was just beautiful. She had such a tiny little waist, wonderful porcelain skin and bright, sparkling eyes. 'She turned to us and said: ""Ready, girls?"" and with that we were off. We were all a bag of nerves, but she was so calm it made us realised everything would be fine. 'Inside it was so spectacular, the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The colours, the music were just wonderful. Remember we girls had lived through the war, which was just so gloomy. Then we were suddenly transported into this wonderful tapestry that had come to life. 'Unfortunately half way through the service my dress was so tight that I began to faint. Black Rod [a senior officer in the House of Lords] was standing next to me and saw my legs buckle slightly, so held me up. We had smelling salt sewn into our gloves and I crushed my vial and wiggled my feet in an attempt to stay awake. 'Fortunately during the recess the Archbishop of Canterbury came up and offered me a nip of brandy from a flask he had hidden in the Abbey. That did the trick.' Britain's Queen Elizabeth returned to the scene of her Coronation today to mark a reign that has weathered six decades of social transformation and the end of her country's global empire . Unlike the pomp and circumstance of the Coronation itself, the reception at Buckingham palace was most definitely a family affair, with the young Prince Charles and Princess Anne running around and hiding under their mother's voluminous dress. 'When people ask you what the best moment of your life was, most say their wedding day. Of course I remember that too. But the Coronation was something exceedingly special. I was so lucky to be a part of it…..the roars, the excitement,' she said. 'After I had stood on the balcony with the Queen I went down to the crowds and listened to them calling for her. There were so many people, you couldn't squeeze a pin between them.' And later that night there was another, far less decorous celebration. 'My uncle had been asked to chaperone some of the visiting sheiks and I went out to nightclub with them until the early hours!' she recalled. The 60th anniversary ceremony remembering the Queen's 1953 Coronation was held in Westminster Abbey today and attended by all six maids of honour . Asked what she thinks the secret to the Queen's six remarkable decades on the throne is, Lady Glenconner, now 79, who went on to marry Colin Tennant, the 3rd Baron Glenconner, sums it up in one word: duty. 'I often discussed it with her sister, Princess Margaret, for whom I became a lady-in-waiting, and she told me that was what they were brought up to expect. The Queen was raised to give her life to her country,' she said. She continued: 'The Queen has behaved impeccably over the years and I think people realise that. 'She is actually a very modest  person to be around and I think the celebrations this year and those to come have made people realise what a tremendous debt of thanks we owe her as a nation. 'I remember very distinctly watching her in the Abbey as she was being anointed, she had stripped off her regalia and stood there in her simple white shift. It made her look very vulnerable, a young woman with the weight of her world on her shoulders. 'Then the years of training kicked in. I feel thrilled 60 years later to have played a small part in that remarkable day.'","Lady Rosemary Spencer-Churchill and Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart .

"Shocking images of a gunman moments before he shot dead six people in front of an ex-girlfriend who had ended their relationship were today released by police. Dmitry Vinogradov, 29, launched his deadly attack, which lasted just 18 seconds, in a Moscow office yesterday. CCTV footage of the disgruntled lawyer shows him walking into the building wearing a large rucksack carrying guns, heading into a toilet and then emerging heavily armed and clad all in black. He then walks calmly up stairs, killing two men on the way, and into an office where he killed four more. CCTV: Dmitry Vinogradov walks past security and into a Moscow office building wearing a large rucksack carrying guns . Calm: Vinogradov heads into the toilet to get changed and prepare for his massacre . On a mission: Vinogradov leaves the toilet heavily armed and clad all in black . Killer: Vinogradov approaches the finance department. At this point, he has already murdered two people on the stairs . His former girlfriend, accounts department clerk Anna Kaznikova, 26, can be seen running from the room. She escaped unharmed. Vinogradov was then overpowered by office workers, and tied up by security guards. His sixth victim, Nikita Strelnikov, died today. The 30-year-old suffered multiple wounds in the massacre as he sought to shield female colleagues from the gunman. Two women and three other men were also killed in the shooting spree in the offices of a pharmaceutical company; all were shot in the head. The other three . male victims were named as Alexander Biryuk, Andrei Tertiakov and Denis . Moiseev, all 33, and the women were Elena Lapshina and Natalia . Plekhanova, both 25. Yaroslava . Sergenyuk, 24, was struck by a bullet to her chest which pierced her . lung, and another which damaged her nose. She was rushed to hospital by . helicopter and is fighting for her life. Determined: The gunman is just a couple of seconds away from murdering four more people in cold blood . Terror: Vinogradov's former girlfriend Anna Kaznikova runs away from the massacre . Fleeing: The 26-year-old was not targeted in the attack and escaped unharmed . Apprehended: After 18 seconds of intense bloodshed, Vinogradov is overpowered by office workers and then tied up by security guards . Major incident: Vinogradov lies on the floor as shocked office workers look on . Vinogradov's rampage was sparked . after he was jilted by Miss Kaznikova. It was first reported that she . had been wounded, but it now appears her ex-boyfriend let her escape . unscathed, . He had called her minutes before storming the office room where she works. Instead of at her, he aimed his two . guns - one in each hand - at office workers who he blamed for mocking . him, thus prompting her to end their relationship. The spree lasted only 18 seconds before he ran out of ammunition and was overpowered. Kaznikova . did not speak about the shooting but she revealed: 'We started dating . in summer last year. He made me little sweet presents, took me to the . cinema. But he was too romantic for me, wenever got too close. 'We . finally split up in winter when he started being angry. He was really . jealous. In January, he sent me a text message and blamed me for making . him feel angry. He also called me rude names.' Hours before his bloody attack, Vinogradov posted a 'manifesto of hate' on the internet, comparing mankind to a 'giant cancer tumour'. Witness: Anya Kaznikova saw her colleagues shot in the head by her ex-boyfriend, ten months after she broke up with him . Killing spree: Vinogradov (left) shot dead six people at the pharmaceutical company where he worked as a lawyer. He later told police that his work colleagues were to blame for ending his relationship with Miss Kaznikova (right), who also worked at the Moscow firm . His sinister manifesto, posted at . 4.56am yesterday, drew immediate comparisons with Norwegian mass killer Anders . Breivik, who shot dead 69 people at a camp last year. Police . say Vinogradov came to the Rigla plant at Chermyanskaya Street, Moscow, . where his ex-girlfriend worked, at 9am and was allowed in as a lawyer . for the company. Miss Kaznikova said Vinogradov was initially nice, buying her cinema tickets and her favourite pancakes, before becoming possessive and angry . The killer then went to the toilet . where he changed into army fatigues and went out into the depot with a . Saiga hunting rifle and an Italian-made Benelli shotgun. He gunned down two men on the stairs before going into his ex-girlfriend's office where he shot his other victims. In a chilling confession, he later . told police: ‘We were dating for a long time but in January this year we . split up. I tried to get her back but failed. 'In March, I bought a rifle and 200 bullets and a uniform. ‘My colleagues are to blame - they . advised Anya to split with me. I came into the office where Anya worked . and said: “Hello, colleagues”, and she saw how I began to shoot all of . them. ‘I wanted them to see how strong I was and then I planned to kill myself.’ Vinogradov’s . mother Elena Vinogradova revealed on Wednesday that the couple had . rowed before breaking up over a romantic trip he had booked to take her . to Scotland . She said: ‘He quarreled with that girl Anya from the finance department. He is from the law department. 'I understand it that his shooting was in the finance department. It is likely that they mocked him somehow. ‘Before . they split up, he bought her a trip to Edinburgh, ordered everything, . paid for it all, and some two days before it she said: “I'm not going."" He was in a horrible depression after that.’ Vinogradova had been on medication to cope with his depression but had not taken it the day before the shooting. His mother added: ‘He was absolutely quiet yesterday,’ adding that she had tried to discourage his interest in shooting. In . his manifesto posted on a Russian social site which also included . racist images, Vinogradov declared: ‘I hate human society and I am . disgusted to be a part of it! I hate the senselessness of human life! I . hate this very life! I see only one way to justify it - to destroy as . many parts of the human compost as possible. ‘This . is the only right thing which everyone of us can do in his life, it is . the only way to justify it, the only way to make this world better. ‘The . way of surviving and self-perfection of a man is a mistake, it leads to . a dead end, to destroying of all the rest, of all what is really alive.'' Another life: Vinogradov is pictured saving a seagull from an oil slick in 2010 as a World Widelife Foundation  volunteer . ‘Evolve! Become aware of your real . meaning and place in this world! Understand that you are aliens here, . you are the genetic rubbish which should not be here, rubbish which . appeared accidentally, as a result of a mistake in evolution, rubbish . which must be destroyed.’ One image carried the slogan 'End Racism Kill Everyone', featuring a black child with a gun. He . described his views as ‘ultra-conservative’ and also said on his site . that the ‘main thing in life’ was ‘making the world better’. He listed shooting as an interest and is believed to have legally owned the firearms he used. Hate-filled declaration: One of the images Vinogradov posted online in a manifesto several hours before his frenzied attack, vowing 'to destroy as many parts of the human compost as possible' 'I hate human society': Vinogradov posted on a Russian social site before the killings and described his views as 'ultra-conservative' One of his favourite films was listed as Natural Born Killers. He . hated television, describing it as the ‘sewage of human intellect’. His favourite quote is listed as ‘hope is the worst evil because it . prolongs human suffering’ by Friedrich Nietzsche. A police statement said: ‘Three men and two young women sitting at their desks died on the spot. ‘One more man and another young woman were wounded, they are receiving medical help.’ A source said: ‘He told investigators that he had fallen in love with a girl who was a pharmacist, but his feelings were not reciprocated. ‘Because of that he drank for five days and today he came in and opened fire.’ Another source said he would undergo psychological assessment. He said: ‘He is of course not Breivik but the analogy suggests itself.’ He graduated in 2009 from the Academic Law University in Moscow and worked as a company lawyer for the Rigla chain of pharmacies.","Dmitry Vinogradov, 29, launched his deadly attack in a Moscow office .

"Criticism: Viewers have complained to Ofcom about the British Comedy Awards, hosted by Jonathan Ross, with some calling for it to be scrapped because of bad language . Viewers could have been excused for expecting an evening of jollity from the country’s sharpest wits. But instead, Channel 4’s British Comedy Awards descended into  alcohol-fuelled profanity from the likes of Jonathan Ross. The two-hour broadcast was described as a ‘car crash’ after a series of comics slurred their way through rambling, expletive-laden speeches. The programme, which also suffered from technical problems, prompted a stream of invective from the audience online, and more than 50 official complaints to the broadcaster and its watchdog, Ofcom. Many took particular offence at Ross’s performance as host, with some branding it embarrassing. Others noted that stars including Alan Carr and Johnny Vegas appeared to be drunk. Guests at the event in north London were plied with free wine, cider and beer for an hour before the broadcast began at 9pm. Gavin and Stacey actor Mathew Horne could be seen crawling on the floor and giggling while the show took place. Inevitably, many of the lowlights involved 53-year-old Ross, who first presented the annual ceremony in 1991. In one tasteless sketch, he and Lee Mack, who was named best male TV comic, joked about the infamous Sachsgate affair that led to Ross’s suspension from the BBC. With a mask strapped to his face, the presenter pretended to be a ventriloquist’s dummy while Mack made him issue a mock apology for the incident in 2008, when he and Russell Brand left foul-mouthed messages on Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sach’s answerphone. When Mack, as Ross, began the skit with ‘hello Andrew Sachs’, Ross responded: ‘Oh f*** off’. Scroll down for video . Bad joke: Jonathan Ross and Lee Mack in a sketch where the host was forced to apologise to Andrew Sachs using a series of expletives . Message: The host took to Twitter to show his disdain for Channel 4 after they cut the awards to show a repeat . Mack continued: ‘I’m so sorry for . being a ****. I’ve never had the confidence to say but I’ll say it now, . what I did was bang out of order.’ Mack . then made Ross offer his resignation to ITV, where he now hosts a chat . show following his departure from the BBC, before adding: ‘Once again, . Andrew Sachs, I’m sorry.’ In . another shocking segment, gay comedian Alan Carr told X Factor judge . Nicole Scherzinger that he wanted to ‘do a reverse Tom Daley’ and ‘f*** . your brains out’, referring to the Olympic diver’s recent admission that . he is dating a man. Vivienne . Pattison, the director of campaign group Mediawatch-UK, branded the . night’s swearing ‘pointless and unfunny’ and criticised Channel 4 for . allowing it to appear uncensored. Controversial: Alan Carr (left) told Nicole Scherzinger he wanted to 'sh-f***' her when she collected an award . Passionate: The thrilled comedian also kissed the host on the lips and admitted he'd 'had a drink' Slight: Johnny Vegas took a swipe at Ricky Gervais in his speech and said his comedy was based on poking fun at 'victims' Response: Ricky Gervais, who was not at the ceremony last night, responded to Johnny Vegas' comments online today . She said: ‘It’s a bit sad that a . ceremony that is meant to be rewarding the wittiest comedy should resort . to the lowest common denominator by replacing jokes with swear-words. ‘It . wasn’t clever and it wasn’t witty. You can’t get away with using that . kind of language in your workplace, in a shop, or at school. So why . should people think it’s acceptable on TV?’ One upset viewer wrote online: ‘Why all the unnecessary swearing? Didn’t make them funny, just desperate.’ Another added: ‘Jonathan Ross is excruciatingly unfunny. You can tell everyone in the room is embarrassed for him.’ The . programme overran after a bizarre rant from Johnny Vegas, who . complained that ‘there are people in the room we don’t think should have . won’, adding: ‘I won an award about nine years ago and haven’t won . f****** anything since.’ As a . result, the final speech of the night from Steve Coogan, accepting an . outstanding achievement award, was cut short to broadcast a repeat of . the reality show Gogglebox. This appeared to be Ross’s biggest regret of . the night, for he later posted on Twitter: ‘Hope you enjoyed the Comedy . Awards. Channel 4 are f****** idiots for cutting Steve Coogan’s speech . off for a REPEAT.’ Mistake: Steve Coogan collects his award at the end of the show but his speech was cut short, which led to Jonathan Ross calling them 'f****** idiots' Football fan: Paul Whitehouse yelled 'Yid army', a reference to his beloved Spurs, which has been banned amid concerns it incites racial hatred . Crocodile tears: At one point, Ron Burgundy had an faux emotional moment as he accepted his International Achievement award . Some 40 . viewers complained to Channel 4 about the programme while another ten . have contacted Ofcom, which must now decide whether to investigate . further. A Channel 4 . spokesman said: ‘The British Comedy Awards is an established live event . and is well-known for its raucous nature and edgy humour. The programme . was preceded with a warning that the humour was of an adult nature and . contained very strong language.’ They added: ‘Unfortunately, due to a transmission error the end of Steve Coogan’s speech was unintentionally cut off.’ Outstanding Achievement Award - Steve CooganThe Writers Guild of Great Britain Award - Paul WhitehouseBest Comedy Panel Show - Would I Lie To You Best Comedy Entertainment Programme - The Graham Norton ShowBest Sketch Show - Harry & Paul Best Sitcom - Getting On Best New Comedy Programme - PlebsBest Comedy Entertainment Personality - Alan Carr (Alan Carr's Chatty Man) Best Comedy Breakthrough Artist - Adam Hills (The Last Leg)Best TV Comedy Actor - Jack Whitehall (Fresh Meat)Best TV Comedy Actress - Miranda Hart (Miranda) Best Female TV Comic - Nina Conti (Live At The Apollo)Best Male TV Comic - Lee Mack (Would I Lie To You)International Achievement Award - Will Ferrell .

"Gerry Conlon, who was wrongly jailed for an IRA attack on a pub in Guildford has died at his home in Belfast, it has been announced. Mr Conlon, 60, had been suffering an illness for some time. He received a life sentence after being wrongly convicted of 1974 attack alongside Paul HIll, Carole Richardson and Paddy Armstrong at the Old Bailey in 1975. Gerry Conlon, received a letter of apology from Tony Blair in 2005 over his wrongful conviction and imprisonment over the 1974 Guildford pub bombings . Mr Conlon and the rest of the Guildford Four served 14 years of a life sentence for the attack which killed five people and injured 65, before their convictions were overturned in 1989. Mr Conlon's family issued a statement through his lawyer Gareth Peirce. It said: 'This morning we lost our Gerry. 'He brought life, love, intelligence, wit and strength to our family through its darkest hours. 'He helped us to survive what we were not meant to survive. 'We recognise that what he achieved by fighting for justice for us had a far, far greater importance - it forced the world's closed eyes to be opened to injustice; it forced unimaginable wickedness to be acknowledged; we believe it changed the course of history. 'We thank him for his life and we thank all his many friends for their love.' Gerry Conlon left the Old Bailey in 1989 a free man after his conviction for the Guildford pub bombings was quashed following an appeal . Alex Attwood, SDLP Stormont Assembly member for the area, paid tribute to him. 'He'd given an awful lot but yet had so much more to give,' Mr Attwood said. 'What he learned from his time in prison and campaign for release was the importance of not only raging against his own injustice but fighting for those who had also suffered miscarriages of justice.' Mr Attwood added: 'He's now with his dad and his mum.' Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe, who was jailed as part of a discredited investigation into a supposed bomb making family - the Maguire Seven, died after five years in jail. His mother Sarah, a tireless campaigner for their freedom, died in 2008, aged 82. Daniel Day-Lewis, left played Gerry Conlon in the 1993 film In The Name Of The Father alongside Pete Postlethwaite, right, who played his father, Guiseppe Conlon . Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams expressed his shock and deep sadness at the news. 'Gerry and his father Giuseppe were two of the most infamous examples of miscarriages of justice by the British political and judicial system,' Mr Adams said. 'Their story was told graphically in the film In The Name Of The Father. 'To his family and friends I want to extend my sincere condolences.' Mr Conlon was represented by leading human right's lawyer Gareth Peirce, who also secured the release of the Birmingham Six . In 2009 Mr Conlon wrote about the personal and emotional battles he suffered as a result of his incarceration and fight for freedom. He suffered two breakdowns, attempted suicide and became addicted to drugs and alcohol following his release. Mr Conlon also only began enduring nightmares after securing freedom. 'The ordeal has never left me,' he said. The high-profile deadly attacks in Guildford, Woolwich and Birmingham in 1974 became better known for the huge miscarriages of justices they led to in the aftermath, with the public demanding the perpetrators be brought to justice. Gerry Conlon, Paddy Armstrong, Paul Hill and Carole Richardson were jailed in 1975 for the attack on the Horse and Groom pub in Guildford which killed four soldiers and a civilian and injured scores more. Mr Hill and Mr Armstrong were also jailed for the Woolwich bombing in which two people died. In a separate trial, The Birmingham Six - Paddy Joe Hill, Hugh Callaghan, Richard McIlkenny, Gerry Hunter, Billy Power and Johnny Walker - were convicted for carrying out the Midlands bombings. Later Giuseppe, and members of the Maguire family - who became known as the Maguire Seven - were arrested and jailed for possessing and supplying the IRA with the explosives for the bombs. But all those involved protested their innocence and after years of campaigning their convictions were overturned. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four after they had served 14 years behind bars, amid doubts raised about the police evidence against them. An investigation into the case by Avon and Somerset Police found serious flaws in the way Surrey Police handled the case. Emerging from the Court of Appeal a free man, Mr Conlon declared: ''I have been in prison for something I did not do. I am totally innocent. 'The Maguire Seven are innocent. Let's hope the Birmingham Six are freed.' In July 2000 the Prime Minister Tony Blair became the first senior politician to apologise to the Guildford Four. The case file concerning the Guildford Four remains classified under the Official Secrets Act and can be remained sealed for the next 45 years . In a letter sent to Paul Hill's wife - one of the American Kennedy clan - he wrote: 'There were miscarriages of justice in your husband's case, and the cases of those convicted with him. I am very sorry indeed that this should have happened.' Giuseppe Conlon died in prison in 1980, still protesting his innocence, and never saw his son freed. In June 1991 Giuseppe's sentence was posthumously overturned by the Court of Appeal along with those of the Maguires. The Birmingham Six also had their convictions overturned on appeal in 1991. Although the Guildford Four scandal has been known for 30 years the case files remain classified. Along with the Birmingham Six the material associated with the investigation and prosecution is held under the Official Secrets Act where it can remain shut to the public for 75 years. Mr Conlon in recent years took up the cause of a number of dissident republicans jailed in Northern Ireland including Marian Price. She was found guilty of offences linked to paramilitaries including providing a phone used by the Real IRA hit squad that murdered two British soldiers at the Massereene barracks in Co Antrim in 2009. He insisted his approach was not one of political motivation but for the right of people to have a fair trial and the right for justice to be seen to be done in public. Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister, Eamon Gilmore, also extended his condolences. 'I am saddened to hear of the death of Gerry Conlon and send my condolences to his family and friends. 'Mr Conlon suffered a grave miscarriage of justice along with his father, Giuseppe, Paul Hill, Carol Richardson and Paddy Armstrong. 'In later years Gerry drew from his experiences to campaign on behalf of others with the group Miscarriages of Justice Organisation. 'His loss will be felt both within the community in west Belfast and across the world with all those who work in pursuit of justice.'","Gerry Conlon was wrongly convicted of the 1974 Guildford pub bombings .

"Culinary Casanova Paul Hollywood is spicing up The Great British Bake Off once again, with fans pointing to simmering sexual tension between him and contestant Ruby Tandoh. Hollywood, 47, made headlines in May when he split from his wife after developing a ‘close friendship’ with 35-year-old Marcela Valladolid, his co-star on the American version of the TV baking competition. And when he named ex-model Miss Tandoh star baker this week, viewers suggested it was not just her brioche he was sweet on. Tension: Silver fox Hollywood, left, was spotting gazing at Ruby, right, during this week's episode . The 21-year-old won the ‘sweet dough’ challenge on Tuesday night’s show, making a sweet tea loaf, Hollywood’s recipe for apricot couronne and two varieties of European sweet buns. But on Twitter, many fans of the BBC2 series were more interested in romance than rolling pins. Katie Roberts said: ‘I’m going  to miss The Great British Bake Off when it’s done. 'I enjoy living vicariously through the sexual tension between Paul and Ruby.’ Mollie Hinks joked: ‘I thoroughly look forward to Tuesday evenings and witnessing Paul Hollywood trying not to flirt with Ruby.’ Fans of the show have taken to Twitter to say they are more interested in any signs of bubbling romance between the pair than any of the baked goods . Filming of the current, fourth series of The Great British Bake Off began a few weeks after news of Hollywood’s split from his wife Alexandra emerged. Essex-born Miss Tandoh, who was briefly signed to leading agency Models 1, is now studying philosophy and history of art at University College London. She struggled to impress Hollywood’s fellow judge Mary Berry at first, but since winning her over is tipped to win. This week Miss Berry called her bake ‘almost perfect’ and her brioche ‘delicious’. Despite a less than promising start, student Ruby is now tipped to win the competition .","Paul Hollywood gazed lovingly at Ruby Tandoh during show, fans say .

"Every bride wants to look perfect on their wedding day and it seems Angelina Jolie is no exception. But will she really go as far as to have surgery to remove bulging veins in her arms? That's the claim made by U.S. magazine National Enquirer who report that the actress 'wants to look as beautiful as possible when she walks down the aisle this summer' to tie the knot with long-term partner Brad Pitt. Angelina is regularly voted one of the most beautiful women in the world but an 'insider' told the magazine the Oscar-winner 'has always had a complex about how her veins jut out'. Bridal perfection: A U.S. tabloid states Angelina Jolie wants to be rid of the jutting veins in her arms ahead of her wedding to Brad Pitt . They said: 'She never had an incentive to do anything about it until now. She's . chosen a sleeveless gown for her wedding day, and the last thing she . wants is to be looking like a freak in the photographs.' It's is unlikely there will be much chance of that when the 38 year old marries Brad, 50, with whom she has six children. But the magazine claim she's so keen to 'tidy up' her appearance for the big day she will consider surgery. The other option would be for the slim star to gain weight so the protruding veins were less obvious but the source said 'that’s not an option to her.' According to an 'insider' the actress, pictured here with Brad Pitt and their son Maddox, has always had a 'complex' about her veiny arms and the wedding has finally given her an incentive to do something about it . 'If she took the time to bulk up, everything in her life – including the toll all the weight loss has taken on her body – would fall into place. But Angie's just too busy to eat. She’s also convinced that she needs to stay super-skinny to maintain her sex appeal. That leaves her no option but surgery to tidy up those veins,' they said. Endovenous laser treatment is frequently used to reduce the appearance of unsightly varicose veins. A catheter is inserted into the troublesome vein and a laser is passed through that which then delivers short bursts of energy that heat up the vein and seal it closed. Blood no longer pumps through it and so it disappears. What complex? Sceptics point out that If Angelina is so paranoid about her arms, why does she often wear sleeveless gowns on the red carpet? Spire Healthcare offer the treatment in the UK on varicose veins in the leg for a 'guide price' of £1,765. They state the loss of the treated vein is not damaging because 'after treatment the blood in the faulty veins will be diverted to other normal veins in order to make its way back to the heart.' Keith Rose a venous specialist at cosmetics surgery provider MYA.co.uk and Courthouse Clinics told MailOnline: 'Endovenous Laser Therapy is an established minimally invasive technique for the treatment of varicose veins in the lower limbs. 'Long term studies have shown that the results are as good as, or better than open surgery and the technique is recommended by NICE as the first choice for varicose veins in the leg. 'EVLA for veins in the arm is a novel use for this technology and there are very few clinicians offering this procedure in the UK.' Numerous celebrity websites have been quick to dismiss the report that Angelina would consider such treatment on her arms.

Meanwhile celebdirtylaundry.com states that while Angelina has a track record of having surgery for medical reasons after she had a mastectomy last year to prevent breast cancer, they believe she wouldn't have cosmetic surgery because it's 'fraught with risks, and I doubt she's willing to take them'. Endovenous laser treatment involves having a catheter inserted into your vein and using an ultrasound scan to guide it into the correct position. A tiny laser is passed through the catheter and positioned at the top of your varicose vein.The laser delivers short bursts of energy that heat up the vein and seal it closed. The laser is slowly pulled along the vein using the ultrasound scan to guide it and allowing the entire length of the vein to be closed.Endovenous laser treatment is carried out under local anaesthetic.

"Judges at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal have controversially overturned the convictions of two Croat generals for crimes committed against Serbian civilians. The decision has sparked an outcry in Serbia where politicans accused the court of ‘selective justice’. Deputy Prime Minister Rasim Ljajic condemned the ruling, saying the tribunal had ‘lost all its credibility’ amid warnings the ruling raised questions about the handling of cases in The Hague and could bring into the open the thinly concealed animosity between the two Balkan neighbours. Controversial: Judges have overturned the convictions of Ante Gotovina (left) and Mladen Markac (right) for crimes committed against Serbian civilians. The decision has been met with anger in Serbia . ‘What happened (in the court) is a testimony to the selective justice which is worse than any injustice,’ he declared. The decision, by a 3-2 majority in the five judge appeals chamber, is one of the most significant reversals in the court’s 18-year history and overturns a verdict that dealt a blow to Croatia’s self-image as a victim of atrocities, rather than a perpetrator, during the Balkan wars in the 1990s. Neither Ante Gotovina nor Mladen Markac showed any emotion at the decision, but their supporters in the court’s packed public gallery cheered and clapped as Presiding Judge Theodor Meron ordered both men freed immediately. Gotovina and Markac were sentenced to 24 and 18 years respectively in 2011 for crimes, including murder and deportation. Judges ruled both men were part of a criminal conspiracy led by former Croat President Franjo Tudjman to expel Serbs. No credibility: Deputy Prime Minister Rasim Ljajic condemned the ruling . But the appeals judges said prosecutors failed to prove the existence of such as conspiracy, effectively clearing Croatia’s entire wartime leadership of war crimes in the operation known as Operation Storm. Some 600 Serbs were killed and more than 200,000 were driven from their homes during the operation when Croat forces retook the Krajina region. Gotovina’s and Markac’s convictions were one of the few at the tribunal set up in 1994 to punish perpetrators of atrocities against Serb civilians. Gotovina is especially popular among Croatian nationalists. The charismatic former soldier fought in the French Foreign Legion in the 1980s and spent four years on the run from justice before being captured in the Canary Islands in December 2005. The verdicts against the two generals had triggered anti-Western sentiments among nationalist Croatians ahead of the country’s planned European Union entry in July 2013. After the convictions last year, thousands of Croatian war veterans massed in Zagreb and ripped EU flags and denounced Croatia’s leaders who have made EU membership their goal. Yesterday there was jubilation in the Croat capital Zagreb where thousands of people - many dressed as war veterans - burst into applause after the verdict was announced. ‘Our generals are heroes because they risked their lives to save our country and liberate the people,’ student Andjela Anic, 26, said. But in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, the acquittals enraged hard line opponents of the U.N. court in who accuse its judges of anti-Serb bias - a kangaroo court, they say, whose main aim was to vilify and convict Serbs. Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic said : ‘It is now quite clear the tribunal has made a political decision and not a legal ruling. The ruling will not contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region and will open old wounds.’","Ante Gotovina and Mladev Markac showed no emotion at the decision .

"The United Kingdom could be broken up on the basis of Labour voters rushing to back independence, 15 years after Tony Blair set the country on the road to devolution. The former Prime Minister has been conspicuous by his absence from the referendum campaign trail, despite being born in Edinburgh. But senior Tories blame him for failing to predict the rise of nationalism, and say the battle to save the Union will be won or lost in what used to be rock solid Labour areas. Scroll down for video . Blame: Conservatives say Tony Blair paved the way for the rise of the SNP and the independence movement . Campaign: Independence supporters have put a big Yes sign on the hills overlooking Edinburgh . It was the New Labour landslide in 1997 which swept the Conservatives out of Scotland and paved the way for the rise of Alex Salmond’s SNP. Mr Blair supported devolution, which was overwhelmingly backed by Scots in a referendum. The Scottish Parliament then opened in 1999, to the obvious delight of Mr Salmond who said it was a major step on the road to total separation. In the 2011 elections to the Scottish Parliament, the SNP secured a surprise overall majority, with Mr Salmond declaring he had a mandate for a referendum on independence which could not be ignored by Westminster. Mr Blair has avoided campaigning for a No vote as he knows he remains a divisive character north of the border in the wake of the Iraq War. Leader: Alex Salmond rose to power in Scotland when Mr Blair was serving as Prime Minister . Close: A new Daily Mail poll shows the No campaign just four points ahead of Yes . Debate: Graffiti has appeared on the walls of buildings in Scotland arguing for a Yes vote . In his autobiography, the former Labour leader claimed he was to blame for the party's humiliating defeat by the SNP in 2007, and the Nationalists have repeatedly described him as 'toxic'. But many of those now battling to save the 307-year-old Union in the final hours of the campaign say Mr Blair must shoulder the blame. Former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major has blamed Labour for the growing threat of Scottish independence – claiming the party had spent years attacking the Conservatives and Westminster. Sir John said Labour and the SNP ‘have fed a divisive narrative that has bitten deep, ignoring the revolution in Scottish living standards brought about, in large part, by Conservative policies’. He added in an article in The Times last week: ‘It would be ironic indeed if Scotland voted for separation, and Labour lost all its significant representation in the House of Commons. If this comes to pass, no one should weep for them.’ Creation: The Scottish Parliament, pictured, was supported by Tony Blair when it was found in 1999 . Celebration: Mr Blair with Donald Dewar, the first Scottish First Minister, after the referendum on Scottish devolution in September 1997 . A new Survation opinion poll for the Mail shows that the race is still too close to call. The headline results show that 44.1 per cent of Scots plan to back independence, up from 42.4 per cent in a comparable poll from last week. Support for a No vote remains virtually static at 47.7 per cent, with 8.3 per cent undecided. Overall, this points to a final result of 52 per cent No and 48 per cent Yes. But alarmingly for the No camp, the poll indicates a shift back to Yes among Labour voters, who may decide the outcome. While 91 per cent of those who voted Conservative in the 2011 Holyrood elections are backing No, just 60 per cent of Labour voters plan to do the same. Labour’s big beasts like Gordon Brown and John Reid have been deployed to try to win back their supporters to the No cause. But Mr Blair’s only recent intervention has been during a speech in Ukraine. He said: 'Obviously I hope that Scotland votes to stay part of the United Kingdom.' Contrast: Gordon Brown and John Reid are pictured on the campaign trail ahead of the referendum . Speaking at a security conference in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev at the weekend, he added: 'To rip up the alliance between our countries would not be sensible, politically, economically or even emotionally.' Born in Edinburgh, Mr Blair went to school in Durham before returning to Scotland to attend Edinburgh's Fettes College. His father was born in Yorkshire but grew up in Glasgow. In his final speech to a Scottish Labour conference in Oban in 2006, he famously said: 'I detest this narrow nationalism not because it engenders fear but because it squanders hope.' Ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of Better Together, has previously called for his former boss to play his part in a 'call to arms' to keep the UK together. But Mr Blair has been reluctant to speak out, in stark contrast with his successor, Gordon Brown, who has returned to frontline politics to fight for the Union. Downing Street insists there is little David Cameron can do to persuade more people to the No cause. ’There is a massive Labour effort on the ground,’ said a source. ’We are leaving the field open to Labour. Almost all Tories are voting No. There is literally nothing more we can do. ’Labour have got to swamp the area.’","Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh but has not campaigned on referendum .

"There is a football stadium in the tiny Tunisian settlement Hammamet, hometown of Lazhar Khedira, where the grass is long and dry and the nets have holes in them. The goalposts are square, not round, dating them to before 1987 when they were banned by FIFA. There are three white walls surrounding three of the sides and a wire mesh fence behind one of the goals. Tall trees grow at one end and the hum of a busy main road nearby can be heard. Top of the World: Sami Khedira is a World Cup winner with Germany and could now be set for Arsenal . German bond: Mesut Ozil is believed to have spoken to the Real Madrid midfielder about the London life . 'This is the stadium where Sami Khedira got famous,' one local recalls. Between the age of 10 and 15, this is where World Cup winner Khedira, born in Stuttgart to a Tunisian father and German mother, Doris, would often come to play when he visited. Although he has always represented the German national side, from under 17s through to winning 51 caps for the seniors, Tunisia is a large part of his life. Khedira explains: 'Although Hammamet is not my home, it is the hometown of my father so it is also important for me. 'My entire family lives there. My grandma and my grandpa live there as well as seven aunts and one uncle. I don't even know how many cousins I have there. 'Hammamet for me is a beautiful place for vacation. I really love to go there and visit my family. I like to relax on the beaches and to get away from my daily routine. It is the perfect place for a retreat, where I can feel at home.' On the move: Khedira has not signed a new deal at Real Madrid and is set to leave . Breakthrough: Khedira started out at hometown club Stuttgart in Germany . Khedira would also hone his football skills on the beaches when he would go on holiday there as a teenager. He joined Stuttgart's youth team in 1995, aged just eight, so by the time he was visiting his father's family at 15 he was already a star in Hammamet. It did not stop him returning to play with his peers on that pitch with overgrown bushes peering over the walls. 'It was a great honour for our guys to learn from him,' the same local recounts. 'He is very friendly and generous, that's why people like him. In particular they love his kindness.' Khedira was a local hero, but back in Germany he was fast becoming a star, too. At Stuttgart he won the Bundesliga title in 2007 then captained the Germany Under 21 side which won the 2009 European Championship, beating England 4-0 in the final. It was a team which included Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels and Mesut Ozil, who would all also go on to win the World Cup in 2014. Swoop: Arsenal have already signed Alexis Sanchez for £30million and are considering Khedira for £20m . A year later he earned a move to Real Madrid where he has since won a La Liga title, two Spanish Cups and the Champions League. After . winning the World Cup, Khedira's stock is at an all-time high and his . refusal to sign a new deal at Real, with only a year left to run on his . contract, has meant they are willing to cash in. Arsenal see him as the ideal man to plug the gap in their midfield. Arsene Wenger's side is crammed with attack-minded midfielders and forwards – Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ozil, Rosicky, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta – but lack a defensive midfield linchpin. Mathieu Flamini did a job there last season but he is not world class. If an agreement can be met, that humble man who grew up playing on a tatty, battered pitch in Hammamet might well be the perfect fit.","Real Madrid midfielder is a £20million target for Arsenal .

"Determined: Keira Knightley won the battle against dyslexia with hard work . Actress Keira Knightley has revealed that she tried a popular technique to help her overcome dyslexia as a child – but found the old-fashioned method of perseverance worked far better. ‘I had tutors for years and I used coloured plastic sheets to put over the text which helps some people but didn’t really help me,’ says the star. For Keira, 29, overcoming the obstacles of dyslexia – a learning disability that affects mainly reading and writing – came down to simple hard graft. ‘A lot of it is down to perseverance and hopefully you’ll have parents who will work hard with you, because that’s what mine did. I still have days where reading just won’t work but most days it will. ‘I don’t think it’s something that ever fully goes away. Sight-reading is a problem – I can read text on the page but if I have to read it aloud, it might be a problem. That doesn’t come easily.’ Keira, has said her mother helped her by making her recite Emma Thompson’s Oscar-winning screenplay for Sense And Sensibility aloud. A new machine that enables doctors to tell within hours whether cancer drugs are working is being trialled in Britain. It could save the lives of those who are not responding to drugs by switching them to more effective treatment. ‘The standard method for assessing if a treatment has worked is for a patient to take a course and then determine whether or not the tumour has shrunk,’ says Professor Kevin Brindle at Cambridge University. ‘This could allow doctors to tell much more quickly whether a treatment is working.’ GE Healthcare’s SpinLab machine works by making visible glucose molecules – that MRI scanners have not been able  to detect – which show the molecular changes of cells, indicating whether a drug is working on a tumour. Those with lymphoma, breast cancer and glioma – a type of brain tumour – are most suitable for the trial. Putting on weight may increase the . risk of dementia – and the damage may be done early in life. Increasing . levels of fat can lead to a shrinking of grey matter, according to . researchers from the US National Institute of Ageing. As the amounts of . fatty tissue increase, grey matter is lost in the front lobe, an area of . the brain involved in decision-making, problem-solving and planning. Just how fat could have such an effect is not clear, but it is . recognised that fat tissue produces compounds involved in inflammation. Dr James Pickett, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Maintaining a . healthy weight can play a role in reducing the risk of developing . dementia.’ High life: The View From The Shard are about to offer weekly yoga programme set to run for eight weeks .

"Andrew Lloyd Webber is gaining royalties from downloads of his Wizard Of Oz stage musical version of the song that activists want to reach No.1 . Lord Lloyd-Webber, the prominent Conservative and admirer of Baroness Thatcher, is inadvertently profiting from a campaign to get Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead to the top of the charts. The composer, who will attend Mrs Thatcher’s funeral this week, is gaining royalties from downloads of his Wizard Of Oz stage musical version of the song that anti-Thatcher activists are trying to get to No1. Downloads of the song from the music mogul’s 2011 West End production are outselling that from the 1939 Wizard Of Oz film on one of the country’s most popular download sites. And for each 99p download of the Lloyd Webber version, it is understood his company, The Really Useful Group, receives  royalties for copyright – although it is unclear how much. Music download website, 7digital said the recording by Lloyd Webber’s cast at the London Palladium was outselling the original film  version because it shows up first on its search engine. The website would not confirm how many people had downloaded the track, but a spokesman said it was in the hundreds. Last night, other leading music websites, iTunes, Amazon and  eMusic, did not respond to requests by The Mail on Sunday asking how many times the Lloyd Webber  version had been downloaded. The song has however already topped the iTunes and Amazon charts for several days. In the midweek Official Singles Chart it was listed at number 10 and is . on course to be number one after selling more than 10,600 copies. It came as elderly actors who played Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz have told of their shock at the campaign to propel Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead to the top of the charts in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death. Ruth Duccini, 94, and Jerry Maren, 91, who sang the song as part of the classic family film's cast of munchkins, said it was 'terrible' that the song had been hijacked by critics of the former prime minister, who died at the Ritz on Monday. 'Nobody deserves to be treated in such a way... I am ashamed I really am,' Ms Duccini said. Campaign: The song Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead from the iconic family film is climbing the charts in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death .

Mr Maren, who also appeared in the Judy Garland film, agreed, adding: 'It is shocking that the song is being used to celebrate the death of someone.' He described Baroness Thatcher as a 'great lady'. The pair spoke out after the BBC was accused of fudging the decision over whether to play the track during the chart show on Radio 1 this weekend.

"Gratitude: Anna Wing was a regular at the Turkish restaurant in central London and left the tip in her will as a 'token' EastEnders star Anna Wing left £5 to a restaurant boss among the £90,000 legacy she bequeathed in her will. The actress, who the cantankerous Lou Beale between 1985 and 1988, stated that the legacy to Kazim Akkus - the owner of Efes and Efes 2 in London's West End - was 'a token of gratitude for all his generosity'. Wing, who died in July at the age of 98, was a regular customer for more than 30 years at Mr Akkus's Turkish restaurants. Probate records released last week reveal that she left the bulk of her estate in trust for her two sons as well as individual legacies to charities, relatives and friends. Mr Akkus said the gift was a 'lovely surprise' from a loyal customer, who, he said, loved his 'hummus, taramasalata and kebabs'. Wing always left 'one or two pounds' as tips for his staff, the 71-year-old restaurateur said. Mr Akkus said: 'I am really touched that she remembered me in this way. 'She was a regular and used to come in once or twice every week. 'But she came in less as she got older because she had problems walking and I think I last saw her about three years ago. 'She would always love to have a chat while she was having a coffee or something to eat.' Mr Akkus said Wing had mentioned that she wanted to leave him something, but he had refused.

The remainder or her estate was left in trust for her sons - actor and director Mark Wing-Davey, 64, and Jon Wing-O'Connor. Wing-Davey was the child of Wing's three-year marriage to actor Peter Davey which ended in divorce. Wing-O'Connor was born from her seven year relationship with writer Philip O'Connor.","Actress who played Lou Beale from 1985 to 1988 died in July this year .

"A Texas police officer who killed 19-year-old shoplifter has walked free from court despite being found guilty of manslaughter. Russell Rios was killed during a scuffle with Sgt. Jason Blackwelder, 30, in July 2013 after he chased the teenager who was suspected of taking iPad cases worth $50 from a Walmart. But Blackwelder has walked free from court after a jury ruled yesterday he should serve his five year sentence on probation. Conroe Police Sgt. Jason Blackwelder (left) has walked free from court despite being found guilty of manslaughter after killing shoplifter Russell Rios (right) during a scuffle . Rios' family reacted with anger after the verdict, with his father, Juan Cuyun, branding it 'a joke'. Rios' mother, Jacqueline, told reporters outside the courtroom: 'Remember, my son is a human. He’s not an animal. I think everybody respects more a dog or a cat than my son. 'The police can kill anybody and only get five years probation because they’re police, because they don’t have criminal records? 'I’m embarrassed to go outside because they laugh in my face. The justice system is laughing in my face.' Blackwelder was off duty when he joined security guards chasing Rios from a Walmart store last year. He eventually caught up to the teenager in nearby woods, where a scuffle broke out. Blackwelder initially claimed he shot Rios in self-defence after the teen throttled him, but later evidence showed Rios was shot in the back of the head. Prosecutors argued that Rios was face down when the gun, which was tucked into Blackwelder's waistband without a holster, went off unintentionally. Outside the courtroom Russell's father. Juan Cuyun (centre) called the sentence 'a joke' while his mother, Jacqueline Rios (left), broke down in tears saying he had been treated worse than an animal . Blackwelder was off duty when he helped chase Rios from this Walmart. The pair struggled in nearby woods at which point Blackwelder's gun, which was tucked into his belt without a holster, unintentionally went off . Blackwelder was facing up to 20 years behind bars on the manslaughter charge, but his defenece argued for probation as he has no previous convictions. His defence also argued that the fact of conviction was punishment enough as Conroe Police Department are now set to fire him. A felony conviction prevents him from working as an officer. Neither Blackwelder nor his attorney offered any comment after the sentencing, as a federal lawsuit is still pending. Police Chief Philip Dupuis told The Courier: 'First, the Conroe Police Department would like to extend our condolences to the Rios family at the loss of their family member. 'While knowing our words provide little comfort, our hearts understand your loss. 'It is our belief that the Conroe Police Department conducted a comprehensive investigation with integrity and ethical fortitude.'","Jason Blackwelder, 30, killed 19-year-old Russell Rios last year .

"The new NBC summer horror show Siberia has come under vitriolic fire from none other than Siberia itself. The Russians are taking aim at the show, which premieres tonight, for being portraying stereotypes and pretending to depict Siberia when it was made in Manitoba. ‘In reality, this faux-reality show was filmed on the other side of the world, in a Canadian prairie province,’ storms The Siberian Times. Scroll down for video . Siberia, which premieres tonight on NBC, has been criticised by the Russians for stereotyping . Siberia: The 'contestants', who are actual actors, of the new NBC show . 'Not that most viewers will realise this as they watch this negatively-slanted portrayal of Siberia,’ states the English language website. ‘US viewers are conned into believing the action is in Siberia, which is after all the name of the show.’ Siberia, which is likened to Survivor, shows sixteen contestants being dropped off in winter-time, somewhere in Siberia, each trying to survive longer than the others without any equipment or food in the remote territory of Tunguska. Their host, Jonathon Buckley (played by the real-life Jonathon Buckley, former host of Lifetime’s 2012 reality competition, Love for Sail) informs them that they need to make their way to the remains of a primitive trading outpost that was found abandoned in 1908. When they reach the settlement they discover the fires are still burning and the food is still cooking on the stoves, but all the inhabitants have vanished. The mock reality series shows the participants, who are in fact actors, chasing the $500,000 prize for survival in . the harsh conditions. The TV show Siberia shows the contestants fight for survival in the Siberian tundra . Tunguska event: Siberia was struck by falling meteor pieces on July 30, 1908. The energy of the explosion knocked over roughly 80 million trees . The TV show pretends to be filmed on the site of the Tunguska meteorite explosion nearly a century after the event in Siberia, Russia . NBC and the show's US production companies are also being accused of ‘censoring’ Siberians from seeing online trailers and a pilot episode which is supposedly full of thrills, spills and scare tactics. When they try to look at it, Russian viewers from the Urals to the Pacific are shown a message reading: ‘We're sorry, but the clip you selected isn't available in your location’ even though they trying to tune in from Siberia. The Siberian Times accused the show of being ‘in keeping with the US stereotype of Siberia, mixed with a cocktail of Hollywood horrors and then frozen in a Cold War time warp'. The pre-publicity for the show says the participants suddenly encounter a tiger, which brings more mockery from the news website. ‘It must have escaped from a Canadian zoo because Tunguska would be some three time zones west from the habitat of the nearest Siberian tiger.' The critique continues: ‘Siberia's image in the world which takes another hit, just at a time when it is rightly recovering a more positive image around the world, with inward investment and foreign tourism growing significantly. 'These investors and tourists come in search of the real modern Siberia, unlike the makers of this TV fake.' The Siberian Times goes on to say: ‘This clearly is of no interest to NBC and those who made this series in Manitoba, namely Infinity Films Productions in association with Sierra-Engine Television and the appropriately named Welldone Productions.’",Mock-reality show Siberia premieres tonight on NBC .

"An Australian policeman is a part of a crew that have successfully rowed across the Indian Ocean to break two world records and raise money for MS Australia. They started as a crew of seven, but after 57 days six people, including Victorian Tim Spiteri, completed the continent-to-continent expedition, which is the fastest and longest rowboat crossing of the Indian Ocean. 'There were pirates, hurricanes, our boat was hit by a 15-metre blue whale, we encountered countless tiger sharks - there is nothing else the ocean could have possibly thrown at us but I actually never wanted it to end. 'I wouldn't change a single one of the challenges we faced' says Mr Spiteri, speaking to Daily Mail Australia from their Seychelles. The crew pop champagne as part of their excited celebrations as they reach the shore of Seychelles, successfully completing their record breaking expedition across the Indian Ocean. The exhausted crew upon arrival at Seychelles after their almost 8600km row . The crew on board the Aurora, the vessel which they rowed from Geraldton, Western Australia to the Republic of Seychelles, east of the South African mainland. The crew included Tim Spiteri, Leven Brown, Cameron Bellamy, James Douglas-Hamilton, Heather Rees-Gaunt and Fiann Paul. Dr Shane Usher, a 39-year-old Chemical Engineer from Melbourne, was forced to drop out halfway through the trip when he suffered serious burns after scalding himself with hot water. Dr Usher was on hand to welcome the crew in at Seychelles. 'The arrival was a big event with a lot of champagne! There was a lot of happiness and relief after such a long voyage. They came off the boat with a bit of a staggered walk but are all doing very well,' Dr Usher tells Daily Mail Australia from Seychelles. Australian policeman Tim Spiteri on the morning his expedition departed from Geraldton, Western Australian. 57 days later, his crew had successfully rowed to Seychelles. Mr Spiteri agrees that the crew are struggling to get their bearings on dry land. 'We were walking down the street the other day and one of the crew fell into a pothole! After 57 days at see, you think you're walking straight but you haven't quite got a grip on how your body works.' The exhausted crew are looking forward to 'a dry bed that doesn't move,' according to Mr Spiteri. The team have lost a lot of weight during their expedition. 'The problem was that we faced hurricanes, with wild waves. It looks like we faced over 65 knot winds at times. Such extreme winds aren't characteristic of ocean rowing and it took the team a while to manage to keep their food down', explains Dr Usher. The crew worked tirelessly, taking only two hour rests before picking up the oars again. 'We rowed for two hours on and two hours off 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the entire journey. You lose track of time, the physicality of it all is so painful,' said Mr Spiteri . But the mental struggle was one of the biggest that the crew had to battle with during the trip. 'It was the most torturous, treacherous, wonderful, brilliant, life-changing experience,' explains Mr Spiteri. The challenge was only made harder after the automatic steering system failed, and Mr Spiteri and the crew's skipper, Leven Brown, were both forced to manually navigate the boat. 'We knew it would hurt, but the physicality of having to stand still to navigate was excruciating. In the military, standing still for that period of time is used as discipline! 'It required 100 per cent concentration and it was really difficult to try and maintain course through the rain and cloud that completely obscured our vision.' The Aurora at sea, with the Australian flag at the back of the boat used as a crucial tool to help steer and navigate - vital after the automatic steering system broke down and Tim Spiteri and Leven Brown were required to manually steer for the rest of the journey. Mr Brown, who now holds five Guiness World Records for ocean rowing, says the mental challenge is more arduous than the physicality of rowing. 'It's intensely physical but the relentless routine and the sheer scale of the obstacle that you have to overcome is the hardest. You have to constantly be at the top of your game. However, Mr Brown says the team must remain level-headed at all times - even when the crew came face to face with pirates. 'There's far too much to do, you don't have time for nerves on the ocean. It's later when you look back on the brush with storms and pirates that you sit down and have a deep sigh!' said Mr Brown. 'A boat with no markings or fishing equipment came alongside us, which indicates that you're dealing with pirates. They asked us to stop but there was no way we were giving up that easily. We were 200 miles away from our destination. 'We just had to bluff. We had no equipment on board but we said we were a Royal Levy Q boat waiting for Royal Navy and would open fire. They high-tailed it out of there, it was absolutely amazing!

Excited friends and family wait for their loved ones to arrive at Seychelles after their 57 day expedition across the Indian Ocean . Shane Usher, who was evacuated halfway through the row after suffering burns, waiting at Seychelles for the crew to arrive on August 8 . Mr Brown says the inability to control your environment is a liberating experience. 'I row oceans because I have never experienced the same sense of freedom and adventure on land as I did in those moments on the boat.' 'There are sharks all around you, Blues Whales... It's a beautiful environment. The ocean is one of the last great wildernesses. 'We saw a couple of Great Whites from our tiny little boat. You have a primal reaction: fight or flight.' A 15-metre whale came too-close for comfort, causing damage to the team's boat. 'It was as if the whale deliberately collided with the boat, it seemed to be scratching a skin irritation,' said Mr Spiteri. 'A huge whale and little boat... It was potentially expedition ending!' Another obstacle the crew had to overcome was losing the sixth member of their team, Mr Usher. 'A big cargo ship with medical facilities came and picked me up. The ship actually banged into the rowing boat while they were taking me on board. It took eight days to travel back to Australia and I was confined to my room for seven of those days, to avoid reinfecting my burns,' Mr Usher said. Mr Spiteri is ecstatic about the crew's achievement. 'It was honestly the most epic adventure anyone could go on. It was a pioneering first world attempt and I still can't get my head around the fact that we did it! It surpassed every one of my expectations.' The Australians on board: Tim Spiteri (left) and Shane Usher, preparing on the day of their departure on June 11, 2014 . The crew on board the 'Aurora' - their vessel that took them almost 8600 kilometres across the Indian Ocean . The crew came across pirates, sharks, hurricanes and a 15-metre long Blue Whale, which used the boat to scratch an itch, much to the crew's mixed fear and amusement . Tim Spiteri has so far raised more than $30 thousand for MS Australia, a cause close to his heart as his mother struggles with the condition. 'Mum was out on a boat with the other family members and met us when we reached Seychelles. To see her face at the end was unbelievable, the emotion and relief on her face. We had minimal contact with anyone during the trip so I think her heart was in her mouth the entire time we were at sea.' Mr Spiteri found he gained insight about life with Multiple Sclerosis, a debilitating disease of the Central Nervous System. 'I was surprised that there was some synergy between my experience on the row with the kinds of struggles I've seen my Mum face with MS. 'With MS you want to do things but it doesn't work that way. Your brain won't cooperate with your brain which makes it really difficult to do the things you want to. I'm able to empathise with that struggle more now after the physical struggle of the row. 'We faced hurricanes with winds that kept pushing us South as we tried to row North. We were prevented from doing what we wanted for a myriad of reasons. But you push through every obstacle and something you change your goals but just have to keep going. 'It's a little like the brave people with MS that still manage to live and achieve with their symptoms everyday.' Mr Spiteri found the physical and mental challenge to be a humbling and profound experience. 'I learnt so much about myself and about people - about what you can achieve as a group of people in arduous circumstances when you need to. 'I'm really going to miss my time being on a very small boat in a very big ocean where I didn't have any control, just the small ability to work with I have, fighting all the way. 'It changes your philosophy about life. It makes your realise the importance of letting go. So many obstacles pop up along the way that want to take you out and knock you over, but all you can do is just do one stroke after the other and eventually you'll get there. And hopefully it's a paradise like Seychelles' Tim Spiteri revealing the logo on the side of the boat for one of the charities the crew were raising fund for, Save The Elephants .

"College tuition fees may have risen by more than 400 per cent since in the last 40 years, but the number of graduates has also increased dramatically. An interactive map uploaded by Metric Maps shows the  increase in US citizens obtaining a bachelors degree  from 10.7 per cent in 1970 to 28.5 per cent in 2012. Almost half a century ago, college graduates made up less than 10 per cent of the population in a huge number of areas across the country, the map shows. In 1970 only a small number of areas had more than 30 per cent of people studied for four years at college. These included the San Francisco Bay Area, parts of Colorado and Washington D.C . In only a few regions — the San Francisco Bay Area, parts of Colorado and Washington D.C. — did the number of people who had completed four years of college approach a third. By 1990, there had been an enormous change with more areas showing an increase in the proportion of their citizens obtaining degrees. Large parts of the northeastern and western coasts could boast that at least a third of their population were college graduates. In 2012, the number increases again, with yet more areas showing a high percentage of residents achieving a bachelors degree. The dramatic increase across the country is surprising considering the substantial rise in college tuition. In 1970 for example, a University of Utah student would spent about $390 a year on tuition. Today it costs around $6,000. The rise is also putting pressure on the job market and is causing thousands more to be left with mountains of student debt at the end of their courses. PBS reported that the percentage of American jobs that require bachelor’s degrees to be somewhere between 20 and 35 percent. It means the market may not have enough employment opportunities for all the graduates. By 1990, the picture had dramatically changed, with coastal areas showing a higher proportion of people obtaining a bachelors degree .

"Lawsuit: Art enthusiast Sheikh Saud Bin Mohammed Al-Thani has been accused of amassing huge debts with auction houses . A sheikh who has spent more than £1billion on his art collection has denied accusations of being a 'serial defaulter' and amassing a pile of unpaid debts with some of the world’s top auction houses. Saud Bin Mohammed Al-Thani - 'reputedly the world’s largest collector of objets d’art'- is being sued by dealers who say he has dishonoured a pledge to pay $19.7 million for a collection of ancient Greek coins sold at auction in New York in January. Saud, 45, 'purchased nearly $20 million . worth of coins from the Prospero Collection', regarded as the finest . assortment of Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic Greek coins ever . assembled, the High Court was told. Although the dealers are still holding . the coins they are . insisting that the sheikh should be bound by his bid at auction. The dealers’ QC, Jeffrey Gruder, likened Sheikh Saud to an 'inveterate gambler' who could not stop himself spending millions on objects of his desire before walking away from his obligations. 'He bids, wins and then doesn’t pay. One can only conclude that this is a person acting dishonourably and disreputably. He is bidding when he knows he’s not going to be able to pay,' the barrister claimed. 'Perhaps in a perverse way he enjoys the process of bidding. If one wants to be an amateur psychiatrist, maybe he is like an inveterate gambler who can’t stop himself gambling at Ladbrokes every day.' Three dealers - A.H. Baldwin and Sons Ltd, Dmitry Markov, who trades as Dmitry Markov Coins and Medals, and N&M Numismatics LLC - say the sheikh has given no 'explanation or excuse' for his failure to pay, and Mr Gruder said he had left an 'extraordinary trail of unpaid debts'. The case reached the High Court as their lawyers urged Mr Justice Haddon-Cave to continue an asset freezing injunction imposed on the sheikh, who is a cousin of the ruling emir of Qatar, on October 9. Mr Gruder made hotly disputed allegations that Sheikh Saud’s total unpaid bill to worldwide auctioneers and art dealers includes £4.3 million owed to Bonhams, around $42 million owed to Sothebys, and various other sums owed to at least five other auction houses and art dealers. 'The fact that he is a member of the Qatar royal family is not relevant,' the QC went on - 'because if this is his conduct it doesn’t matter who he is.' Case: The row relates to the sale of the Prospero collection of Greek coins (file picture) He repeatedly gave A.H. Baldwin the 'run-around' when they tried to pin him down about paying the $19.7 million bill, Mr Gruder alleged, offering to pay part of the outstanding cash in return for acquiring some of the coins. 'There were further meetings asking for the money, but basically nothing was paid,' he added. Treasures: The Clive of India Flask (pictured) - a Mughal treasure - was brought back from India by Robert Clive in the 18th century and bought by the sheikh for £3million . The deadlock over payment became so entrenched that the UK ambassador to Qatar - and his opposite number in London - became involved. 'But, despite the best efforts of the two ambassadors, no payment has been forthcoming from the sheikh,' said the QC. The sheikh rose to prominence after he spent  £1billion on art between 1996 and 2004. In 2000, he splashed out more than £9m on 136 vintage photographs . including great works by Man Ray and Alfred Stieglitz from the . collection of Hamburg photographer Werner Bokelberg. Other prominent purchases during this time include a £5m Fabergé egg . bought at Christie's in New York in 2002, a £4.6m complete set of . Audubon's Birds of America, and a £7.9m Roman marble statue, the Jenkins . Venus. In 2003 he beat London's V&A to purchase the £3m Clive of India . flask. 'Sheikh Saud was a passionate art collector with a great eye,' said Georgina Adam, editor-at-large of The Art Newspaper. In 2005 the Sheikh's spree came to a dramatic end when he was placed . under house arrest in Qatar. He allegedly used a London dealer to fake . invoices, misleading the Qatari government about the value of the items . he was buying. He was sacked from the country's national culture . council. However, within a year he was spotted at auctions again. In 2008, he . bought 90 per cent of the lots at a sale of Chinese art at Christie's. Last month, he was spotted at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht. Mr Gruder also voiced concerns that the sheikh might be decamping from his London base now that his creditors have begun to gather, claiming that he left the UK earlier this month 'when the going began to get hot'. Prized: A full set of 'The Birds of America' (1827-1838) by John James Audubon (sample of three drawings) was sold to Saud for £4.6m . Beautiful: The sheikh added the Jenkins Venus, a Roman statue circa late 1st to mid 2nd century A.D for £7.9m . But the sheikh’s QC, Stephen Rubin, brushed aside the suggestion that he might be fleeing the jurisdiction. He is currently in Doha - Qatar’s capital - 'where he is a member of the royal family,' said the barrister. 'He hasn’t slunk off in the night to Doha,' added Mr Rubin, noting that it was 'not unusual' for men in the sheikh’s position to 'go back to the middle east when the temperatures begin to drop' in the UK. However, Mr Gruder claimed the sheikh had left 'almost a trail of destruction' behind him. 'He is a serial defaulter, as we have seen, in terms of auctions,' the QC added. Denying those accusations on the sheikh’s behalf, Mr Rubin said he had been 'trying to pay”for the coins for the past nine months. 'There are no doubt timing issues which go to why he cannot pay at the moment, but that’s not a reason to make a freezing order against someone,' urged the barrister, who said the sheikh had been a faithful customer to leading art dealers over the years. 'He is a very well-known and internationally regarded art collector,' said Mr Rubin, who denied that the sheikh had accumulated a tide of unpaid debts. Mr Rubin also attacked the case against the sheikh as 'obviously wrong', pointing out that the dealers had no basis for enforcing a contract of sale with him, as they had merely 'organised' the sale of coins owned by an 'unidentified' client of A.H. Baldwin and Sons. The High Court heard that the Sheikh had given people the 'run around' and has tens of millions of debts with famous auction houses . The QC added: 'The way in which the American complaint is formulated is misconceived, in that it purports to be a claim for enforcement of a ‘contract of sale’, notwithstanding that the claimants were not on any view parties to any such contract with the sheikh.' There was no evidence before the court on the value of the coins which the sheikh 'allegedly agreed to buy', added the barrister, who said that the dealers still have the coins and are free to find a buyer for them if they wish. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave has now reserved his judgment in the case.","Saud Bin Mohammed Al-Thani, 45, accused of bidding $20m for ancient Greek coins but not paying up .

"Competition for places on medicine degrees is now so fierce that high-achieving students should consider alternatives to becoming doctors, the Universities Minister said last night. David Willetts claimed an unsustainable growth in the competition among students applying for medicine courses is ‘one of the most dysfunctional features’ of the school leaving system. He said many students aiming for medicine drop physics in favour of taking maths, biology and chemistry at A-level – but this then rules them out of other scientific degrees such as engineering. Becoming doctors: There has been a sharp increase over the past few years in the number of female applicants for medicine degree courses at UK universities - especially from top private schools (file picture) His remarks come as new figures revealed about 1,800 of the 4,800 A-level students who failed to get into British universities with straight As were applying for medicine. The problem was especially bad among girls, Mr Willetts added, with a sharp increase over the past few years in the number of female applicants - especially from top private schools. He told the The Sunday Telegraph: ‘There are every summer several thousand very unhappy 18-year-olds, predominately but not exclusively female, who think they will become medics who, sadly, do not get a place despite being very smart and well-qualified. ‘And this is one of the most dysfunctional features of the English school leaving A-level system. ‘The truth is that the number of young . people - and it does tend to me more girls than boys - with an . aspiration to do medicine way exceeds any number of places that the NHS . is likely to have.’ Warning: Universities Minister David Willetts claimed an unsustainable growth in the competition among students applying for medicine courses is 'one of the most dysfunctional features' of the school leaving system . With Britain’s medical schools . receiving 11 applications for every place last year - up from nine in 2008 - Mr Willets said teachers must provide students with a . secondary option. He added that engineering departments . at universities should give entrance to top students with no physics . A-Level and allow them to sit catch-up courses. However, . private school headteachers claimed the NHS was at fault for failing to . fund enough places on medical courses – despite complaints over a lack . of trained doctors in Britain. The . heads at Oxford girls’ school Headington and boys’ school King Edward's . in Birmingham both said that around a fifth of their would-be medics . miss out on places every year. There . are strict quotas on the number of students allowed to take medicine . and dentistry courses in the country because the funding comes in part . from the NHS, reported the Sunday Telegraph. Up: The number of applicants for medicine degrees in Britain has risen from 75,000 in 2006 to 84,000 in 2013 . But, two years ago, it was predicted that there would be oversupply of doctors by 2025 – and officials decided that trainee places would have to be reduced by 2 per cent. 'The number of young people with an aspiration to do medicine way exceeds any number of places that the NHS is likely to have' David Willetts, Universities Minister . A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The NHS of the future needs the right workforce in place to make sure patients get the best care. 'Planning the number of medical students ensures that there is a close match between the number of places and junior doctors' training posts available. ‘It also ensures that money is not wasted training more doctors than needed who could end up going abroad to find work.’","University Minister David Willetts: Unsustainable growth in competition .

"New Zealand star Dan Carter will join wealthy French club Racing Metro at the end of 2015 on a three-year contract. The deal, which could be worth as much as £1million per year will bring the curtain down on Carter's stellar Test career. However, world rugby's leading points scorer and one of the All Blacks' all-time leading players will feature at next autumn's World Cup before linking up with the Top 14 club. All Blacks star Daniel Carter will join French club Racing Metro on a three-year deal after the World Cup . Carter has only recently returned to action after he broke his leg playing for the Canterbury Crusaders . The 32-year-old fly-half's announcement confirms a second stint in France, having previously played for Perpignan. He said at a media conference in Auckland on Thursday: 'It's going to be an awesome adventure for me and my family. 'Having visited France many times I know what the French culture and their rugby culture is like and it's something I really love. 'Having said that, it's the immediate future that is exciting me at the moment. 2015 is going to be a big year and I'm looking forward to getting into it. 'My body is feeling really good, I'm training really hard and getting some good conditioning in so I can hit the ground running next year. I'm looking forward to getting out and playing some good footy.' Carter signed a seven-month deal with Perpignan in 2008 but only played five games due to a foot injury . Carter made his All Blacks debut in 2003 and has gone on to win 102 caps, one of only five centurions for the national side. He has broken several records along the way, including amassing an incredible 1,457 points. 'I am sure all New Zealand rugby fans will celebrate Dan's remaining time in New Zealand and he will leave with New Zealand rugby's very best wishes,' said New Zealand Rugby chief executive Steve Tew. 'Dan has been incredibly loyal to New Zealand Rugby over the years and for that we thank him. 'Whilst everyone is aware of his outstanding achievements on the rugby field, it's also important to note that during his career he recommitted to New Zealand at two critical junctures in our rugby history - after the 2007 Rugby World Cup and again following the 2011 tournament. 'That decision by Dan and other senior players to re-sign with New Zealand Rugby after 2007 should not be underestimated; he was a key part of a group of players who formed the backbone of the All Blacks over the following years, which ultimately helped the All Blacks to victory at Rugby World Cup 2011. 'For that we will be eternally grateful to him. We look forward to having him in New Zealand for one final season.' Carter missed the latter stages of New Zealand's 2011 World Cup triumph after he sustained a groin injury . All Blacks centre Ma'a Nonu is also reportedly fielding overseas offers from a number of different clubs . Steve Hansen, who extended his deal as New Zealand head coach earlier this week, also paid tribute to the two-time world rugby player of the year. 'On behalf of the All Blacks, I want to congratulate Dan on his decision and also on his career to date,' he said. 'He is still in the midst of a wonderful career, both as a provincial and Super Rugby player and an All Black, and will leave us as the greatest first five-eighth ever. 'Whilst he hasn't finished yet in New Zealand, he has already set the benchmark for first five play, and we look forward to seeing him out on the paddock in 2015.'

"The passport photo of 'Hana Gaddafi' who was 'killed' 25 years ago . For a quarter of a century, Colonel Gaddafi claimed that his adopted baby daughter Hana was killed in a U.S. airstrike. The dictator even set up a shrine to the six-month-old infant in his Tripoli compound, with replica American missiles and furniture preserved behind glass screens. Yesterday, however, it appeared that it was all a ruse to whip up hatred against the West and win sympathy from ordinary Libyans. Documents and photographs found in the compound suggest that far from perishing in the 1986 attack, Hana is alive – and working as a doctor. She studied medicine in Tripoli and four years ago took English classes at the British Council in the Libyan capital, for which she received an A grade. An examination paper from a Libyan medical facility was written in Arabic and signed ‘Hana Muammar Gaddafi’. There was a passport photograph of a young woman thought to be Hana, along with pictures of her with Gaddafi’s blood daughter Aisha. Colonel Gaddafi created a shrine in honour of Hana in the heavily-fortified base after she 'died' when she was just a few months old . One room in the compound appeared to . have been occupied by Hana, complete with Sex and the City DVD box set, . pop CDs featuring the Backstreet Boys and even cellulite treatments. On shelves which contained medical textbooks there were also photographs of a woman in her mid 20s wearing medical clothing. Earlier this year the German newspaper Die Welt reported that Hana was a doctor who worked for the country’s health ministry. Revelation: The documents relating to Hana were found in Gaddafi's Bab al-Azizia compound after rebels stormed it earlier this week . The paper told how she was a powerful . figure within the Libyan medical profession – and had even used her . status to block the careers and promotions of colleagues. It added that . ‘several hospitals were under her guidance’. She spoke fluent English . and regularly travelled to London on shopping trips. Colonel Gaddafi had claimed his adopted daughter died in the 1986 bombing . The 1986 airstrike, ordered by . President Ronald Reagan, was in retaliation for a Berlin nightclub . bombing by Libyan agents in which two U.S. soldiers died. Twenty years after Hana's 'death' the regime organised a 'Hana Festival of Freedom and Peace' in her honour. When the family's assets were frozen in Switzerland in February as rebel uprisings began, Hana was listed in documents as one of 23 members of the Gaddafi family. Her date of birth was given as November 11, 1985, making her 25 if she is still alive. Earlier this month, files found in Knightsbridge revealed a dentist travelled to Libya to treat a 'Hana Gaddafi' in 2008. The dentist refused to discuss it.","Shrine in Gaddafi's 'House of Resistance' to little girl believed dead after 1986 allied airstrikes .

"Mark Allen played brutal hardball as he swatted aside Belgian teenager Luca Brecel at the Coral UK Championship. The 28-year-old Northern Irishman, runner-up at the York-staged tournament three years ago, beat Brecel 6-0 at the Barbican Centre to clinch a place in the third round. Allen has been a beaten finalist in the Shanghai Masters and International Championship already this season and has his sights on a major prize, which is why he did not want to give 19-year-old Brecel the slightest chance of an upset. Mark Allen played brutal hardball as he swatted aside Belgian teenager Luca Brecel at the UK Championship . Neil Robertson took his cricket bat along to the match in honour of Phillip Hughes . 'I had a game plan to not take on any silly shots against Luca,' said Allen. 'He's not the sort of player you want to let build up confidence. 'He's a very streaky player and I knew if he got a few frames on the board he'd be hard to stop.' Allen refused a number of pots he admitted he might have taken on against other opponents, preferring to put Brecel in trouble. 'I turned down a couple of tricky ones early doors, I didn't miss many when I was in the balls, and I made it hard for him really,' Allen added. Robertson carried out a cricket bat along with his cue as a tribute to compatriot Phillip Hughes . 'I didn't really want to give him any sniff into the match easily, I wanted to make him work for it and I feel I stuck to my game plan well today.' Also in the main arena, defending champion Neil Robertson carried out a cricket bat along with his cue for his match against Kyren Wilson, paying a tribute to fellow Australian Phillip Hughes who died on Thursday. Robertson was finding his match a struggle against Wilson, who took the sixth frame after a re-spotted black to square the contest at 3-3. Meanwhile, Ronnie O'Sullivan confirmed he would be in evening action against Leeds potter Peter Lines. The four-time UK champion has a broken ankle and suggested after a first-round win over Daniel Wells that he may have to withdraw from the tournament, but O'Sullivan wrote on Twitter he was 'gonna give the ankle a go' against 44-year-old Lines.

"The government has launched an extraordinary attack on the United Nations for sending an inspector - branded a 'loopy Brazilian leftie - to Britain to criticise flagship welfare reforms. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps has called on UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon to launch a full investigation into why an official was allowed to issue an ‘outrageous’ report calling for the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ to be abolished. Conservatives reacted with fury to the interference of a supposedly independent observer from an international agency more closely associated with providing assistance to war zones, famines and natural disasters. Mr Shapps told MailOnline the government had no idea why Raquel Rolnik had come to the UK to ‘make a political point’ at a time when ‘there are 50million people living in shanty towns’. Outrageous: UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon (left) has been urged by Tory party chairman Grant Shapps to launch an immediate inquiry into why an official was allowed to become embroiled in a political row in the UK . Under the Government's welfare reform, social tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced since April. Ministers say the removal of the ‘spare room subsidy’ brings social housing into line with the private sector where renters do not get spare rooms for free. The change will is expected to save around £500 million every year. But opponents including the Labour party have dubbed it the ‘bedroom tax’ – a term used repeatedly by Miss Rolnik after a two-week tour of the UK investigating the policy. She also appeared in photographs with opponents of the policy and met with newspapers campaigning against it. Mr Shapps said: 'This report is an absolute disgrace. We think it is pretty serious when the UN turns up and issues a report on a critical area of policy.' But Miss Rolnik remained unrepentant today, insisting the policy was causing 'great stress and anxiety' to 'very vulnerable' people. After Mr Shapps appeared on the radio defending the benefits changes, Conservative MP Stewart Jackson wrote on Twitter: 'Loopy Brazilian Leftie with no evidence on bedroom tax (sic) masquerading as serious UN official on @BBCr4today demolished by @grantshapps.' Controversy: The UN's Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, Raquel Rolnik, declared: 'My immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished' Anger: Peterborough Tory MP Stewart Jackson used Twitter to condemn the remarks by Miss Rolnik . The Brazilian, who has spent much of . her five-year UN post looking at human rights violations in countries . including Rwanda, Kazakhstan, and Indonesia, has decided that Britain’s . housing system is ‘going backwards’. However, it has emerged that she failed . to meet officials or ministers from the Department for Work and . Pensions, and during her only meeting with the Department for . Communities and Local Government, the spare room subsidy was hardly . mentioned. Mr Shapps told MailOnline: ‘It is pretty outrageous. She has done this all under the wire. The government was not asked or consulted. There was no official consultation. ‘I quite simply do not know the answer to why she came here. Who invited her? Why not Brazil where there are 50million people living in shanty towns? ‘She is clearly making a political point by allowing herself to be photographed with people campaigning against the policy. ‘I think the UN has got this totally wrong. I think she is in trouble with this. The General Secretary will have to come back with a full response.’ Controversial policy: The bedroom tax sparked fierce protests in London back in March . This is what Raquel Rolnik, the UN's Special Rapporteur on housing, said about the government's welfare changes: . ‘My immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished. 'I was very shocked to hear how many people feel abused in their human rights by this decision and why - being so vulnerable - they should pay for the cost of the economic downturn, which was brought about by the financial crisis. ‘The right to housing is not about a roof anywhere, at any cost, without any social ties. ‘It is not about reshuffling people according to a snapshot of the number of bedrooms at a given night. 'It is about enabling environments for people to maintain their family and community bonds, their local schools, work places and health services allowing them to exercise other rights, like education, work, food and health.’ But speaking at a press conference today Miss Rolnik said she had been alarmed by anecdotal evidence during her factfinding visit to Britain. Using the term coined by critics of the measure, rather than the Government's preferred ‘spare room subsidy’ tag, she said: ‘I would suggest that the so-called bedroom tax be suspended immediately and be fully re-evaluated in the light of the evidence of its impact on the right to adequate housing and general well-being of many vulnerable individuals.' She went on: 'The right to housing is not about a roof anywhere, at any cost, without any social ties. 'It is not about reshuffling people according to a snapshot of the number of bedrooms at a given night. 'It is about enabling environments for people to maintain their family and community bonds, their local schools, work places and health services allowing them to exercise other rights, like education, work, food and health.' Miss Rolnik's unprecedented visit has taken in trips to London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Manchester where she has spoken to people on housing estates and at food banks. She claims some tenants were contemplating suicide due to the changes, adding that the welfare reforms could constitute a breach of human rights laws. Ms Rolnik's final report will be presented in Geneva to the UN Human Rights Council in March. She claimed that the country was ‘going backwards in the protection and promotion of the human right to housing’. Ruling: Cuts in housing benefit for those who live in larger homes with spare bedrooms is a breach of human rights, according to a UN inspector . But . a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman dismissed Mrs Rosnik’s . findings, saying: ‘It is surprising to see these conclusions being drawn . from anecdotal evidence and conversations after a handful of meetings – . instead of actual hard research and data. ‘Britain . has a very strong housing safety net and even after our necessary . reforms we continue to pay over 80 per cent of most claimants’ rent if . they are affected by the ending of the spare room subsidy. ‘These . changes will help us get to grips with the housing benefit bill which . has grown to £24billion this year, and make better use of our housing . stock. 'We’ve given councils £190million to support vulnerable residents who may need extra help.’ A Government source added: ‘The courts in this country have already ruled that the Spare Room Subsidy is lawful. ‘We . are extremely surprised and disappointed that the UN has come here and . is directly contradicting the decisions of our courts.’","Raquel Rolnik was sent to assess impact of changes to housing benefit .

"A desolate abattoir in a remote corner of Romania was last night revealed as one of the main sources of the horse meat in our supermarkets. The slaughterhouse dominates the tiny village of Roma, in the north east of the country, and makes no secret of the hundreds, if not thousands, of horses it butchers each year. Visitors to the plant, which employs a fifth of the village’s 1,000 inhabitants, are greeted by an enormous hoarding displaying a grazing horse next to a cow. Scroll down for video . The Doly-Com Abattoir in Roma, Botosani County, north east Romania which is the source of the horsemeat at the centre of the scandal . Advert: The giant hoarding outside the abattoir at the Roma plant . Romanian authorities have identified this meat processing plant, run by Doly-Com, as one of two sources of the horse meat at some point fraudulently labelled as beef. The other is the firm CarmOlimp in Brasov, Transylvania. There . is some speculation that some of the horse meat found in supermarkets . across Europe could belong to their cousins - the donkey. A change in the law in Romania is being widely linked to the fraudulent sale of meat from the country. The . authorities are now enforcing road rules meaning that horses and . donkeys can no longer pull traditional carts and are banned from major . routes. This form of . transport has been popular in the country for centuries but . thousands or even millions of donkeys and horses have been sent to . slaughter as there is less use for them, Jose Bove, vice-president of . the European Parliament agriculture committee has said. As a result it is feared that meats contaminated with horse and . discovered in France, Sweden and Britain, may have contained donkey. Agriculture minister Daniel Constantin last night confirmed the exported horse meat came from the two abattoirs but furiously denied they had been responsible for mis-selling the meat. Yesterday, Iulian Cazacut, general director of Doly-Com, admitted to ‘buying horses from anyone’ for slaughter but insisted the firm had done nothing wrong. He told the Mail the firm is now under investigation but said: ‘Everything that we sold was correctly labelled and recorded. We sold horse meat as horse meat. We are being investigated by the Romanian authorities. ‘Officials from the Food Safety Agency have been here. We have sold horse meat abroad. We do not export horse meat to France but we export to the Netherlands, Sweden and Bulgaria. Horse meat is a small part of our business – five per cent. ‘We buy horses from anyone – people who just pass by or from people who are getting rid of horses from farms that are shutting down or mechanising.’ Carm-Olimp, which is owned by the father of a junior Romanian agriculture minister, also claimed not to have mis-sold horse meat as beef. Paul Soneriu, its director, said: ‘We only exported horse meat as horse meat. We did not export any beef in 2012.’ Today there are concerns that donkey meat from Romania may also be entering the food chain. A change in the law in the country means horses and donkeys are now banned from the roads. As they were traditionally to pull carts thousands if not millions have been slaughtered in recent years. Jose Bove, vice-president of . the European Parliament agriculture committee, has said that their meat could then have been passed on to consumers. The director of Doly-com says horsemeat is a small part of the business, around five per cent . Butchered: An executive said the firm buys horses to slaughter from 'anyone' A maze of trading between wholesalers has made it increasingly difficult to trace the origins of the meat – enabling horse disguised as beef to be sold in frozen meals across Europe. Manufacturing line: Workers at the Doly-Com factory . The horse meat found in British foods, including Findus and Tesco own label brands, had passed through several countries before ending up on our shelves. Meat from Romania, which exports £10million of horse flesh a year, was at first sold to a trader in the Netherlands who was fulfilling an order placed by a Cypriot entrepreneur. The Cypriot then sold the meat to French firm Spanghero – which supplies meat to Comigel – the company that made meals for Findus and Tesco at their factory in Luxembourg. It appears that while the meat was sent to the Netherlands it was paid for by money sent from Cyprus. Romania’s prime minister yesterday claimed any fraud over horse meat sold as beef had not happened in his country and he was angered by suggestions it might have been. Victor Ponta said: ‘There is no breach of European rules. committed by companies from Romania or on Romanian territory. ‘I am very angry, to be honest. It is very clear that the French company did not have any direct contract with the Romanian company and ... it has to be established where the fraud was committed and who is responsible for this fraud.’ Horse and carts remain a common means of transport in the Romanian countryside and some can even be seen on the edges of major cities. Abator Roma employs a fifth of the entire village where it is located . Industrial: The abattoir exports horsemeat to France, Holland, Sweden and Bulgaria .

"It is one of the worst moments in history, which still horrifies to this day. During Hitler's brutal reign of Nazi Germany, more than six million Jews were killed. But now new research has discovered that the Holocaust may well be even worse than previously thought. Thirteen years ago, researchers at the United States Holocaust Memorial . Museum began the task of documenting all the ghettos, slave labour . sites, concentration camps and killing factories that the Nazis set up . throughout Europe - and realised they had underestimated the extent of . the Nazis' evil. This map shows the vast spread of SS concentration . camps across Europe . The map shows the Nazi ghettos and camps throughout Europe, spanning German-controlled areas from France to Russia and Germany itself, during Hitler's reign of brutality from 1933 to 1945 . Researchers at the United States . Holocaust Memorial Museum have been documenting all of the Nazi . concentration camps, ghettos, slave labour sites and killing factories . which had been set up across Europe. When they first started the project, the team expected to find about 7,000 camps and ghettos. Shockingly, . they discovered 42,500 camps across large swathes of German-controlled . Europe.  The researchers predict that up to 20 . million people died or were imprisoned in the sites. Speaking . to the New York Times, Hartmut Berghoff, director of the institute, . said: 'The numbers are so much higher than what we originally thought.

When the project began, researchers thought they would find about 7,000 Nazi camps, only to find more than 40,000. 30,000 slave labour camps . 1,150 Jewish ghettos . 980 concentration camps . 1,000 prisoner-of-war camps . 500 brothels filled with sex slaves . 'We knew before how horrible life in the camps and ghettos was but the numbers are unbelievable.' The figure includes 30,000 slave labour camps and 980 concentration camps. As well as 'killing centres' they included forced labour . camps where prisoners made supplies for the war. They also included . sites called 'care' centres in which pregnant women were made to have . abortions or their babies murdered shortly after birth. The researchers have created a series of . maps which present a grim view of life in wartime Europe.They show just . how widespread the camps were, although most were centred in Germany . and Poland. Previous data has . shown just the existence of individual camps on a fragmented basis. But using data from 400 contributors , they . have now documented the large scale operation for the first time. They have discovered exactly where they are located and how they were run. It is now believed that the research could help survivors with their claims over unpaid insurance policies. Researchers say the project has helped change the understanding about Holocaust experts over how the camps were run. The Warsaw Ghetto has been identified as the biggest site - holding about 500,000 people at one point. When the project first started, the researchers expected to find about 7,000 Nazi camps and ghettos. But as the project has gone on, the numbers constantly increased to the current figure of 42,500.","But they were left horrified to discover 42,500 across much of Europe .

Fellow Argentinian Rojo said: 'I first met Angel with Argentina's national team. He was always a cool guy. We've got along well since the first time we met. He is young and so am I, so I've always had a good relationship with him. 'And here at United we are the only Argentinians, so we are almost always together. We're always talking, or sharing a tea [a type of tea in Argentina] or whatever. He is a great person.' Marcus Rojo (left) and Anders Herrera arrive at the restaurant to celebrate with di Maria's birthday . England midfielder Michael Carrick praised di Maria and likened him to United legend Ryan Giggs. 'There are players who have got tricks and can drop the shoulder to go past players, but he is so direct in his play. It is almost like Giggsy used to be in many ways. 'When he picks that ball up he can carry it and change direction pretty quickly, so it is very tough to defend against – especially if he is doing through the middle of the park.'

"For a decade Vancouver reigned unchallenged as the best place to live in the world. But the Canadian city has finally been toppled by Melbourne, Australia, in the twice-annual list produced by the Economist's Intelligence Unit. In fact, Vancouver, known for its spectacular natural beauty and relaxed West Coast way of life, has been relegated to third place, with Vienna, Austria, taking the second spot. Top spot: Melbourne narrowly edged out Vienna and Vancouver as the best city in the world to live in, according to The Economist . Melbourne, the second most populous city in Australia, was ranked highly for factors such as transport and education . The list ranks 140 cities on factors based on stability, health care, culture and environment, education and infrastructure. But following almost a decade at the top, increased congestion may have led to Vancouver losing its crown. And the Canadian city could be in for more bad news, as the list was compiled before widespread rioting in the city in June, meaning its stock could fall further in future rankings. Runner-up: The State Opera House in Vienna, which took second place in The Economist's list of best cities . Canada and Australia featured prominently in the top 10 best cities, with Toronto and Calgary fourth and fifth respectively, while Sydney was ranked sixth alongside Perth and Adelaide in eighth and ninth. 1. Melbourne, Australia 97.52. Vienna, Austria 97.43. Vancouver, Canada 97.34. Toronto, Canada 97.25. Calgary, Canada 96.66. Sydney, Australia 96.17. Helsinki, Finland 968. Perth, Australia 95.99. Adelaide, Australia 95.910. Auckland, New Zealand 95.7 . The only European cities to make the top 10 were Vienna, in second spot, and Helsinki, Finland, which was ranked seventh. The Economist's system scores cities from 0-100 on 30 factors spread across the five areas. The cities at the top of the list are typically ranked very close together as figures for the five areas are usually very high. The first 63 cities in the table (down as far as Santiago in Chile) are all considered to occupy the top tier of liveability. It is thought that cities which do well in the list often share common factors, and are usually mid-sized cities in wealthier countries with a lower population density. London and New York were ranked at 53rd and 56th respectively in the list, the same positions as six months ago. The two cities were let down by their perceived threat of terrorism and the rates of violent and petty crime. London's ranking could also be set to drop following the recent riots across the city. National Opal Collection: The award-winning collection of gems takes visitors from the prehistoric to the modern day . Royal Botanical Gardens: Internationally-renowned gardens set over 38 acres of spectacular landscape . Melbourne Cricket Ground: The vast 100,000 capacity MCG (above) is the world's tenth largest stadium . National Gallery of Victoria: Opened in 1861, it is Australia's oldest and largest public gallery . Werribee Open Range Zoo: African-themed zoo set on 560 acres south-west of Melbourne . Jon Copestake, editor of the report, said despite London's lower ranking, it is unlikely to fall below the 80 per cent score below which cities are classed as 'poor' to live. Mr Copestake told MailOnline: 'Places like London, Paris and New York are almost victims of their own success because they are so popular and so many people go there. 'The amount of people which go to these places means they burden the infrastructure of those cities. 'To say people in Vancouver are disappointed to be ranked third is a massive understatement, judging by some of the emails I've received from Canadians today. 'It was only 0.2 per cent from the top though and is still a city with no major problems at all.' The lower population in cities can lead to a greater variety of recreation activities, as well as lower petty and violent crime rates or overburdened infrastructure. Increased congestion in Vancouver may have led to it being toppled from the top of the list, although authors of the report state the recent closure of the Malahat Highway on Vancouver Island was not the sole reason for the city's fall from grace. Civil unrest in Arab states saw several countries slide in the rankings. The most pronounced dip was Libya, . which slipped 28 places from 107 to 135 out of 140, just above Lagos in . Nigeria and Algiers, Algeria. The lowest ranking cities on the list were Dhaka, Bangladesh at 139, and Harare, Zimbabwe in 140th place. Vancouver, which has topped the list for nearly a decade, was said to have been let down by increased congestion .

"Scientists have invented a pioneering 'injectable foam' device to save wounded soldiers from bleeding to death. The groundbreaking treatment is designed to stem blood loss while casualties are rushed from the battlefield to a hospital or medical station. Biomedical engineers developed the technology after finding traditional methods often can't be used on deep neck, shoulder or groin wounds. Scroll down for video . Scientists have invented a pioneering 'injectable foam' (prototype device pictured) to save wounded soldiers from bleeding to death. The groundbreaking treatment is designed to stem blood loss while casualties are rushed from the battlefield to a hospital or medical station . Two liquid chemicals which rapidly form a foam when mixed are stored separately in canisters in an injector device the size of a marker pen. In action, a soldier would mix the two chemicals inside the injector and push down on a plunger to insert the expanding foam into a colleague's wound. By filling the wound area, it blocks blood loss during the critical first hour until patients can receive urgent medical treatment. The canisters can keep the chemicals - a polyol and a diisocyanate - stable in military conditions at up to 38°C (100°F) for at least a year. Student Sydney Rooney, from John Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, led the team as part of a course project. They came up with the injectable foam system aimed to stop profuse bleeding from a wound near a limb or the head. Such wounds can typically be difficult to stem, as finding the exact source of blood loss is tricky. Eight undergraduates at the American university came up with the idea to beat the weaknesses of using a traditional tourniquet or a gauze pad with a clotting agent. They can be difficult to apply effectively to deep wounds on neck, shoulder and groin injuries. Ms Rooney said the group wanted to stop soldiers losing more than half their blood before getting to a medical station. 'The problem is that damage from bullets and bone fragments deep inside a wound is not always visible from outside the body,' she said. 'A regular clotting agent may not be able to reach the origin of the bleeding. 'We came up with a foam injection system that fills the wound area and blocks the blood loss. 'Our project has been dealing literally with a life-and-death matter and at the end of the day, that provided some extra motivation for our team.' The foam is designed to help stem bleeding when a wound opens up (left). If left untamed the large loss of blood can threaten the survival of a soldier (right).

The groundbreaking treatment is designed to stem blood loss while casualties are rushed from the battlefield to a hospital or medical station . The students carried out experiments with a gel that mimics the consistency of human tissue. They then used a rod to create 'blood vessels' filled with water within the gel and carved 'wounds' into the gel to simulate the bleeding process. Team member Allie Sanzi said: 'The foam fills up the wound opening, hardens, and applies pressure to the walls of the cavity. 'This should lead to more-effective targeting and treatment at the source of the bleeding.' Two surgeons proposed and supervised the project at All Children's Hospital, a Johns Hopkins Medicine facility in Saint Petersburg, Florida. This is a clinical training site for medics in the Green Berets, Navy Seals and Army Rangers. One of the surgeons, Dr Paul Danielson, a military veteran, said the prototype was very promising. 'I don't think it's pie in the sky at all,' he said. 'I think it's a very viable solution to a problem that's been plaguing us on the battlefield.' All Children's pediatric surgeon Nicole Chandler raised the group's 'simple, intuitive' design and said it had the 'potential to save many lives'. While no human testing has yet taken place, the students have received university approval to begin animal testing of the prototype system.

"Microsoft founder Bill Gates, ‘WikiLeaks whistleblower’ Bradley Manning and former U.S. President Bill Clinton are said to be among more than 230 nominees for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and Russian human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina are also believed to be among the candidates. Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is said to be on the list too. The secretive committee does not reveal who has been nominated, but those with nomination rights sometimes announce picks. In the running: 'WikiLeaks whistleblower' Bradley Manning, left, and former U.S. President Bill Clinton, right, are believed to be among more than 230 nominees for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize . Technology billionaire: Microsoft founder Bill Gates is also in the running for the prize, which is usually announced in October and given out in December . ‘They are from all over the world, very many well-known names and some that are not so well-known to the public,’ the Norwegian Nobel Committee's non-voting secretary Geir Lundestad said. Manning is the U.S. Army private charged with the biggest leak of classified information in American history. However, being nominated doesn't necessarily say anything about a candidate's chances. A range of submissions come in every year from lawmakers, professors and others with nomination rights, but the decision rests solely with a five-member panel appointed by Norway's parliament. The deadline for outside nominations was February 1, but the five-member committee added its own suggestions at a meeting last Friday. Last year's prize was shared by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberian women's rights campaigner Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karman of Yemen. Some critics say the committee has departed from award founder Alfred Nobel's intentions by broadening the scope of the prize to include efforts to promote the environment and human rights. Favourite: Moncef Marzouki is a human rights activist who became Tunisian president in December . Earlier this month a Swedish authority that oversees foundations in Stockholm - including the Nobel Foundation - said it would investigate whether the peace committee is complying with Nobel's will. The Nobel Peace Prize is one of five awards instituted by Alfred Nobel, right, the late Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prize is given to those who have ‘done . the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the . abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and . promotion of peace congresses.’ First awarded in 1901, the peace prize . consists of a medal, a personal diploma and cash award and is widely . regarded to be the most prestigious award of its kind in the world. Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, and a prominent voice in the Nobel guessing game, said his favourite for the 2012 award was Gene Sharp. He is an American scholar and advocate of non-violence cited as an inspiration for the Arab Spring and other protests. Giving the prize to him would be a way for the committee to address criticism. Mr Harpviken's other top picks were Ms Gannushkina and the Memorial human rights group, and Nigerian religious leaders John Onaiyekan and Mohamed Sa'ad Abubakar. He said they have ‘spoken out against the misuse of religion in legitimating conflict’. Unfortunately for Mr Harpviken, none of his favourites have won the price since he started guessing in 2009. ‘It could well be that they look to Tunisia,’ veteran Nobel-watcher Jan Egeland, European director of Human Rights Watch, said. ‘It's the only shining success story of the Arab Spring so far.’ Mr Marzouki, a human rights activist who became Tunisian president in December, ‘would symbolise the whole peaceful transition from authoritarian repression to democracy,’ Mr Egeland said. Could be honoured: Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, left, and Russian human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina, right, are believed to be among the candidates . The wave of Arab Spring protests began in Tunisia and swept across Egypt, Libya, Yemen and most recently Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad has cracked down ferociously on his opponents. The protests got a nod from the Nobel committee in 2011, when Yemeni protest leader Ms Karman shared the prize with Ms Sirleaf and Ms Gbowee. Mr Egeland said the Arab freedom drive remained the world's most acute conflict and was far from exhausted as a Nobel theme. ‘There are still 34 or 35 armed conflicts in the world and I think they (the committee) have to get back to recognising heroes of conflict resolution or people working for the victims of war,’ he said. ‘There are many prizes for good deeds in the world, but only one price for peace of this size and format.’ The Nobel Prizes also include awards in medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. A sixth award, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, was created by the Swedish central bank in 1968. Each prize comes with a purse of 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.5 million) and the winners are usually announced in October. The winner receives the prize at a ceremony in December.","'WikiLeaks whistleblower' Bradley Manning said to be among 231 in running .

"Arjen Robben looked as if he was embarrassing Sergio Ramos when beating the hapless Spaniard in a straight foot race as Holland humiliated the world champions. The Real Madrid defender was left trailing in his wake as Robben stormed through; it appeared Ramos was leggy, only for FIFA statistics to later reveal that the 37km per hour sprint was the fastest ever recorded by a footballer. Iker Casillas could then only watch as the Dutchman danced beyond him to score his second sumptuous goal of the night. On his way: Holland's Arjen Robben recorded the world's fastest ever sprint during a game . And gone! The Dutchman set a world record speed of 37km/h as he breezed beyond Sergio Ramos . Blowing: Ramos (and defender Jordi Alba, back) couldn't keep up with Robben as he scored his second . What a shot: Spanish daily AS splashed on the news that Robben is the fastest in the world . But while the finish was perfect in its execution, the foot race preceding it was even more impressive. Robben chased on to a ball from his own half, always half a yard ahead of Ramos, before finessing to slot beyond the goalkeeper. The incident summed up the gulf in class between Louis van Gaal and Vicente Del Bosque's sides during their opening game. Spanish daily AS were understandably fuming the morning after, but tempered the mood when they chose to splash on the news that Robben could rival some of the best in athletics on Tuesday morning as his peak speed is just seven km/h slower than Usain Bolt. They also claim that the 30-year-old has surpassed Theo Walcott's previous record of 35.7kmph, while Cristiano Ronaldo is only sixth in the list of the fastest ever.

"A Dutch teenager has invented a device that he claims could clean up some 20 billion tonnes of plastic waste from the world's oceans. Boyan Slat, 19, came up with the idea of a series of floating booms and processing platforms designed to collect floating plastic rubbish. The 'ocean cleanup' concept is designed to capture the floating plastic but allow life like fish and plankton to pass through unharmed, while saving the waste materials to be recycled. Scroll down for video . Boyan Slat, 19, came up with the idea of a series of floating booms and processing platforms (pictured) designed to collect floating plastic rubbish . The 'ocean cleanup' concept is designed to capture the floating plastic but allow life like plankton to pass through unharmed, while saving the waste materials to be recycled. The design is self-sufficient and saves energy by being tethered to the sea bed (pictured) The Ocean Cleanup Array is an anchored network of floating booms and processing platforms will span the radius of a gyre. The booms act as giant funnels where the angle of the booms effectively 'suck' rubbish in. The debris enters the platforms, where it will be filtered out of the water and eventually stored in containers until collected for recycling on land. One of the most significant advantages of using booms instead of nets is that marine life cannot be caught in them. Furthermore, because the transport of plastic along the booms is driven by the currents, it’s slow enough for organisms to escape. The engineering student believes that . once operational, his device could dramatically reduce the amount of . rubbish in the oceans in just five years time. Millions . of tonnes of plastic debris are littering oceans and have accumulated . in areas of high concentration called gyres - which are essentially . floating rubbish tips. This . litter directly kills millions of aquatic animals annually but also . spreads and introduces harmful algae and invasive species as well as man-made pollutants into the food chain, costing governments and . organisations millions of dollars to clean up every year, according to Mr Slat. Mr Slat believes his invention could make up to $500 million a year from recycling the waste collected (pictured) making it a potentially profitable clean-up solution . While he believes humans must end their reliance on disposable plastic items and manage waste responsibly, his innovation could make a big difference to the cleanliness of oceans in the shorter-term. He proposes fixing sea water processors to the sea bed, which are also attached to the floating platform so that the water can move through them and generate energy. His concept also includes using floating booms instead of nets to cover vast areas of water effectively, while no mesh and a very low speed, means there will be 'virtually no by-catch' and unfortunate animals getting tangled in nets that are meant to help conserve their habitat. His concept uses floating booms (pictured) instead of nets to cover wast areas effectively, while no mesh and a very low speed, means there will be 'virtually no by-catch' and unfortunate animals getting tangled in nets . The litter in the oceans directly kills millions of aquatic animals annually (like this bird with a stomach-full of plastic) but also spreads and introduces harmful algae and invasive species as well as man made pollutants into the food chain . Writing on his website, Mr Slat said: 'Although this hypothesis still has to be . tested, even the planktonic species - due to their density being close . to that of the sea water - may move under the booms along with the water . flow.' In a bid to solve . problems of conventional clean-up measures, including rubbish escaping, . emissions and high costs, he said his contraptions are 'completely . self-supportive' and get their energy from the sun and waves. 'By letting the platforms' wings sway like an . actual manta ray, we can ensure contacts of the inlets with the . surface, even in the roughest weather,' he said. Millions of tonnes of plastic debris are littering oceans and have accumulated in areas of high concentration called gyres (pictured by the circles of arrows) which are essentially floating rubbish tips . While Mr Slat (pictured) is now a student at the Delft University of Technology, he came up with the idea while he as at school to win a number of prizes . As well as solving an environmental problem, Mr Slat also believes his invention could make up to $500 million a year from recycling the waste collected. He said: 'This concept is so efficient, that we . estimate that by selling the plastic retrieved from the 5 gyres, we . would make in fact more money than the plan would cost to execute. In . other words; it may potentially be profitable.' Mr Slat believes that many people need reminding about the environmental disaster affecting the Earth's oceans. He said: 'One of the problems with preventive work . is that there isn’t any imagery of these ‘garbage patches’ because the . debris is dispersed over millions of square kilometres.' 'By placing our arrays however, it will . accumulate along the booms, making it suddenly possible to actually . visualise the oceanic garbage patches. We need to stress the importance . of recycling, and reducing our consumption of plastic packaging,' VR-zone reported. While Mr Slat is now a student at the Delft University of Technology, he came up with the idea while he as at school to win a number of prizes and the respect of more experiences marine experts. He has now set up The Ocean Cleanup Foundation to raise funds to develop his innovation.","Device could remove 20 billion tonnes of plastic from the world's oceans .

"Advertisements for Lynx deodorant featuring glamour model Lucy Pinder have been banned for degrading women and treating them as sex objects. The lads mag model was seen wearing very little and flashing her cleavage in a series of provocative video ads that hark back to the 1970s. The deodorant is made by multi-national manufacturer, Unilever, which is in the dock for sanctioning the images and demeaning women. 'Demeaning': Lucy Pinder in one of the Lynx adverts which the Advertising Standards Authority says goes too far . 'Highly unsuitable for children': The ASA found the adverts crossed the line and are offensive to many . Lynx is marketed using tongue in cheek humour that suggests the men who use it instantly become more attractive, with  beautiful women falling at their feet. However, in a ruling published today, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has accused the company of going too far. One internet video ad showed the model getting dressed, washing a car and eating an ice lolly. In each scene she was wearing different outfits all of which revealed her cleavage. A second showed the model stripping wallpaper, jogging, applying lip gloss, eating whipped cream off her finger and playing with a light sabre. On display near schools: Another poster featuring a different model showering on a beach in just her bikini bottoms drew more than 100 complaints . This Lynx advert for anti-perspirant has got a watchdog hot under the collar . A third featured various close ups of . her cleavage, while on-screen text invited viewers to ‘Play with Lucy’ and gave the Lynx website address. A . fourth featured an image of the model in her underwear and bending over . an oven door. The text stated ‘Can she make you lose control?’. A . poster for the product, which featured another model taking a shower on . a beach and wearing only bikini bottoms, drew more than 100 complaints . with many upset that it was put up close to schools. It carried two controversial straplines, reading: ‘The Cleaner You Are The Dirtier You Get’ and ‘Get Dirty This Summer’. In a ruling published today, the watchdog said: ‘We considered that the various activities that Ms Pinder carried out were presented in a sexually provocative way, and that alongside the focus on Ms Pinder's cleavage … were likely to be seen as gratuitous and to objectify women. ‘We considered that was emphasised by the text ‘Can she make you lose control?’ … and the invitation to ‘Play with Lucy’, which we considered would also be seen as degrading to women. ‘We therefore concluded that the ads were likely to cause serious and widespread offence.’ Criticising the poster, the ASA said the language was ‘clearly intended to imply that using the advertised product would lead to more uninhibited sexual behaviour’. It added: ‘We therefore considered that the poster would be seen to make a link between purchasing the product and sex with women and in so doing would be seen to objectify women.’ The Parliamentary All Party Group on Body Image has announced an inquiry into the issue of body image and depictions in advertising. Lib-Dem MP Jo Swinson, who has campaigned on the issue, said: ‘Lynx ad campaigns have a well-known, if rather far-fetched, theme of the product somehow helping young men to have more confidence with the opposite sex. ‘Sometimes this has resulted in light-hearted and humorous adverts. 'However in this case the ASA has understandably found that using such sexually provocative images, coupled with the invitation to ‘play’ with Lucy, crosses the line, and is offensive to many. ‘These images are highly sexualised, and unsuitable for children.’ In its defence, Unilever said they had no intention to cause harm or offence. They said the products are designed for men aged 17-27 and ‘had been had been popular over the years for its playful, sexy, tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game' narrative’. Unilever said consumers had ‘come to expect, and were comfortable with, the narrative, tone and content seen in their ads’. It said the video ads ‘were designed to be playful, sexy and humorous but not to cause offence’. The Prada fashion giant has been censured over the use of ‘dangerous’ images featuring Oscar nominated child actress Hailee Steinfeld. An advertisement for the label’s Miu Miu range showed the 14-year-old sitting alone and apparently upset and crying on a railway track. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received a complaint that it was ‘irresponsible’ because it was suggestive of youth suicide. Rapped: The ASA concluded that the Prada advert featuring Hailee Steinfeld (pictured) was irresponsible for showing a child in a hazardous or dangerous situation . Instant fame: The teenager received an Oscar nomination for her role in True Grit (pictured) The watchdog rejected this concern, but . has ruled the image broke industry codes because it showed a child in an . unsafe location. The teenager achieved instant fame last year after she received an Oscar nomination for her role in a remake of the classic Western True Grit. Prada defended the advertisement saying it was part of a ‘serious, high-fashion campaign aimed at adult women’ and was placed only in adult, high-fashion magazines such as Tatler. It said the image was meant to portray the actress in between takes of the film, while she was waiting for the next scene to begin. The firm said Miss Steinfeld was not crying, nor had she been asked to cry or look upset. Rather, they said the ad pictured her with a ‘wistful and thoughtful face’. Prada also highlighted the fact that no-one was put in any danger because the images, which were shot by top photographer and film maker Bruce Weber, were taken on an abandoned rail track. However, the ASA said: ‘Because the ad showed Hailee Steinfeld, who was 14 years of age only when the photo was shot, in a potentially hazardous situation sitting on a railway track, we concluded the ad was irresponsible and in breach of the Code in showing a child in a hazardous or dangerous situation. ‘The ad must not appear again in its current form.’","Deodorant manufacturer Unilever in the dock for sanctioning images and demeaning women .

"There is something distasteful about shaking hands with a killer. What makes that sense of unease even worse is when you know that the person you are meeting was responsible for one of the worst atrocities of the Second World War. It was just such a situation I found myself in one weekday in June 2007, in a suburb of Rome. Standing at the door to his flat on the top floor of an apartment block was a kindly looking 93-year-old man, who I was to interview for a book I was writing on the hunt for Nazi war criminals. The old man’s name was Erich Priebke, and yesterday he died at his home in Italy at the age of 100. They say that only the good die young, and in this instance, the bad certainly died old. A row has raged for days over the officer's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-Nazi fanbase . For the man in front of me was a former Gestapo captain who had helped to organise and had participated in the notorious Ardeatine Caves massacre in 1944, in which 335 innocents were slaughtered on the orders of Adolf Hitler as a reprisal for a partisan ambush in Rome in which 33 SS troops had died. Our interview was conducted in English, which he had learnt while working as a waiter at the Savoy in London in the 1930s. As he ushered me into his flat, I thought of a document I had seen only recently in the National Archives back in London, in which Priebke had calmly told a British war crimes investigator how he had ‘killed a man with an Italian machine pistol’, and how towards the end of the massacre, he had ‘killed another man with the same machine pistol’. As well as taking part in the shootings, Priebke drew up the list of those who were going to be shot. He spent the whole night combing through the records of those whom the Germans were holding on suspicion of being in the Resistance. To get the numbers to the ten to one ratio that Hitler had demanded, Priebke even included political prisoners who had been arrested on the flimsiest of evidence. Some of those on the list were teenagers, with the youngest being just 15. Remorseless: Priebke picutred during a court appearance in 1996, he had previously been jailed for life by a military court for the massacre of 335 men and boys at the Ardeatine Caves near Rome . On the morning of March 24, 1944, the . prisoners were taken by the Gestapo and the SS to the Ardeatine Caves, . south of the centre of Rome. With their hands tied behind their backs, . they were led into the caves in groups of five, and then shot in the . back of the head. A report written by an Italian professor of legal medicine in September 1945 conveys the full horror of what took place. ‘The victims fell face downwards, and gradually, as the other condemned arrived, they were obviously made to climb up on the other bodies of the previous victims, otherwise the position of the bodies in layers and their almost uniform prone position could not be explained.’ In order to give his men the wherewithal to commit mass murder, the senior Gestapo officer provided them with a caseload of cognac. As the day wore on and the alcohol was imbibed, their shots became less accurate, thus even depriving their victims of a clean kill. This, then, was the savagery which Erich Priebke had helped to oversee. To my astonishment, on the day we met, even though it was only 10.30am, he wondered whether I might like to share a bottle of red wine. I hesitated. Could I accept such hospitality from such a man? In the end, I agreed, rationalising that superficial conviviality would make for a more revealing interview. As it happened, it did, and what took place that morning was, to the best of my knowledge, the last interview that Erich Priebke gave. Death: Erich Priebke, who carried out one of Italy's worst massacres, died today aged 100 . He told me about his childhood, and . how the early deaths of his parents meant that he had to work at 14. He . started working at a hotel in Berlin, later moving to the Savoy. He . walked to the hotel from his digs in Kensington, and was in the city . for the Silver Jubilee of  George V in 1935. ‘People from all over the . world came,’ he said with fond recollection. ‘The Bengal Lancers and . people like that!’ But the war changed Priebke’s . trajectory, and his linguistic ability caught the eye of the Gestapo. Intelligent and able, he joined its leadership school, and by February . 1941, he had been made a police attaché in the German Embassy in Rome. During . our talk, it became clear that Priebke had no wish to discuss the . massacre. And there seemed little point asking him, as he had no doubt . rehearsed tired old lines about ‘following orders’. But . he did tell me how he had escaped from the British in 1946, and how he . and his wife and two children had been helped by members of the Roman . Catholic Church to start a new life in Argentina. Outrage: In the lead up to his birthday Jewish groups called for celebrations to be banned . Priebke . arrived in South America without a bean, but he built himself up to . become a pillar of the very Germanic town of Bariloche in Patagonia. Astonishingly, he lived openly under his own name, and he and his family . were even registered with the German Embassy. For half a century, Priebke lived . unmolested, until in 1994 he was accosted by Sam Donaldson, of ABC News. When the report was televised, the Italian public were incensed that . Priebke could walk around freely, and in 1996 he was extradited to . Italy, where he faced a series of trials that made headlines around the . world. In March 1998, he was . sentenced to life imprisonment. At the age of 84, he was too old for . prison, so he was detained in his apartment, where he would spend the . rest of his days, and where I would interview him. Appeal: Priebke is escorted by police as he is transferred to the Forte Boccea military prison in Rome in the 1990s . Fascist followers: Italian King Victor Emanuel III, (right) Adolf Hitler (centre) and Benito Mussolini (left) But despite his harmless appearance and the hospitality, there was . plenty of the unrepentant Nazi in Priebke. He told me that the then . Pope,  Benedict, did not wish to help have him released because he was . ‘afraid of the Jews’. Priebke . also appeared to deny the Holocaust when he said to me – ‘We did not . act against them for practical reasons. We needed the railway cars for . other things.’ After more . than two hours, our conversation came to close. I left his flat, . retrieved my passport from the policeman who guarded the block, and . walked out into the sunshine. On a nearby wall I noticed some graffiti . which read, ‘Death to Nazi Priebke’. Yesterday, . that wish was finally granted – seven decades after so many men were . brutally executed while this dead-eyed monster picked his victims out . and pulled the trigger again and again.","Erich Priebke was convicted for his part in the massacre of 335 civilians .

"When the Make-A-Wish foundation transformed San Francisco into Gotham City on Friday, many were moved by the elaborate performance to make a five-year-old cancer survivor feel like a superhero for the day. Miles Scott of Siskiyou County, California was diagnosed with Leukemia when he was just 2-years-old, but his cancer recently went into remission after three long years of chemotherapy. For his Make-A-Wish foundation wish, he asked to be a superhero for the day and the organization responded with an elaborate day full of crime-stopping as the 'Batkid'. While the foundation grants wishes approximately every 38 minutes, Miles' wish generated much more attention than usual. Patricia Wilson, executive director of Make-A-Wish for the Greater Bay Area, explains just why Miles' story became so popular in a new video that gives a behind the scenes look at the Batkid wish. Scroll down for video . Miles saves the day!

Ms Wilson believes the boy's simple wish to be a superhero for a day was something a lot of people could identify with. 'I think this wish just really struck a chord with a lot of people. A lot of people remember from their childhood wanting to be a superhero and here he is battling leukemia and as far as I'm concerned every child with a life-threatening condition is a superhero to me,' she said. Wish-granter: Patricia Wilson, an executive director of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in San Francisco explains the outpouring over Miles' story . When I grow up, I want to be a superhero: Ms Wilson believes that Miles' wish resonated with many people who shared the same wish to be a superhero when they were young . Elaborate: A lot of planning went into Miles' special day. The police chief recorded special messages to him and there were even special papers distributed with the front page headline: 'Batkid Saves City' His ride: The Batkid drives around in the Batmobile to fight the Riddler and Penguin at various locations around San Francisco . While some Make-A-Wish foundation kids receive their wishes while in treatment, Miles' parents decided to wait until he was off of chemotherapy so he would have enough energy for his special day. It also gave him something to look forward to. 'During Miles' darkest moments of chemotherapy and being sick and hospital stays this was a distraction for him - to start thinking about when he was going to be Batman,' Ms Wilson said. Tricks: The Batkid gets ready to pull a trampoline stunt . Wish granted: Ms Wilson says Miles is the real superhero for overcoming a deadly disease . And the wait was certainly worth it. Ms Wilson says a really good indicator of a wish working, is seeing the parents' reaction. 'I know that it works when I look at the parents face. And I look at the joy that they receive,' she said. On Friday, Mr and Mrs Scott were all smiles as they followed their son around on his day of crime-stopping. Hundreds of people lined the streets and cheered as he emerged from the Batmobile - driven by an adult Batman - before freeing a damsel who had been tied to cable car tracks. Happy day: Batkid's dad Nick Scott smiles as he hold's 'Robin' - Miles' younger brother Ryan . Da-na-na-na-na... BATKID! Batman and Batkid (five-year-old Miles Scott, right) prepare to fight their foes on the streets of Gotham City (San Francisco) It's up to you, Batkid! Our heroes discuss how to save the woman as they run to her aid . Bosh! The damsel in distress did not hold back her thanks . As she embraced him in thanks, he got a call that the Riddler was trying to rob a vault downtown, so headed to the Financial District and promptly stopped the thief in his tracks. News cameras captured the moment the Riddler was hauled from the bank and taken away by police officers. Kapow! The Riddler is weak to the power of Batman and his sidekick, Batkid, and is promptly arrested . After battling his enemy, he headed to Burger Bar to refuel, his Make-A-Wish itinerary explained. While at Burger Bar, he received get a call on his batphone to go to the window where he saw a huge group of volunteers screaming for Batman’s help - because the Penguin was kidnapping a famous Gotham City mascot - Lou Seal. Batman and Batkid raced to AT&T park to apprehend the villain and freed Lou Seal, the San Francisco Giants mascot since 1996. After catching the Penguin, Batkid made his final stop at City Hall, where the Mayor and the Police Chief of Gotham City thanked him and gave him the key to the city. Not so fast! The Riddler is taken away by police after he was dealth with by Batkid . Batkid was praised for his efforts, with Senator Dianne Feinstein tweeting: 'Thanks for saving Gotham, Batkid!' Ahead of his heroic efforts, little Miles underwent acrobatic training with his 'Batman', inventor and acrobat Eric Johnston, to prepare him for his big day. Johnston and his wife, Sue Graham Johnston, who played the damsel, even created Bat-style gadgets such as a wrist device that played previously recorded messages from San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr for Batkid throughout the day. Johnston said of Batkid: 'He's an excellent superhero because he's a totally mild-mannered kid when the mask is off. But when he puts on the armored Batsuit, he's uncontainable. He shines.' Around 1,000 special edition 'Gotham City Chronicle' newspapers were handed out at Union Square that day, with the headline: 'Batkid saves city.' And even the illustrators for the original Batman are involved, after Andrew Farago, curator of the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco, reached out to cartoonists and DC Comics. Generosity: Graham Nolan, an original illustrator of the Batman comics throughout the 1990s, drew this image of Batkid taking on Bane, adding at the bottom: 'For Miles - a real superhero!' The boy behind the mask: Miles had told the Make A Wish Foundation that he wanted to be Batkid . Graham Nolan, who drew the Batman series through the 1990s and co-creator of the villain, Bane, was the first to respond - and sent through a drawing showing Miles as Batkid fighting Bane. Nolan signed it: 'For Miles, a real superhero!' 'We certainly all were children who had dreams of being a superhero and being larger than life,' Farago told the Mercury News. 'But I think this has touched people because most of us have never had to overcome the obstacles that this boy has.' While the day of saving damsels in distress and capturing the Riddler was no doubt great fun for Miles, it is also an important day for his family. 'This wish has meant closure for our family and an end to over three years of putting toxic drugs in our son's body,' said his mother Natalie, the San Jose Mercury News reported. The Make-A-Wish Foundation grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to give them hope. Other incredible wishes it has granted include Justin Bieber meeting eight-year-old Annalysha Brown-Rafanan, who suffers from a life-threatening liver condition, and 11-year-old Tyler Sue, who has a serious genetic condition, meeting her 'Cake Boss' idol, Buddy Valastro.

"'The Werewolf': Former police officer Mikhail Popkov (pictured) murdered at least 24 women who reportedly looked like his mother . A former policeman known as a 'perfect husband and father' led a secret life as serial killer who murdered at least two dozen women in Siberia. Mikhail Popkov axed, stabbed or strangled full-figured women 'who resembled his mother' who allegedly abused him in childhood, it was revealed today. Russian investigators say the 49-year-old has confessed to 24 murders, though police suspect him of at least 29 and crime experts fear even more. Nicknamed variously The Werewolf and the Wednesday Murderer - after the day of the week when many of his victims were found in forests - he eluded police for two decades as investigators catastrophically ignored evidence that the mystery killer could be one of their own officers who used his uniform to gain trust. The father of one - who faces life in jail - selected victims who resembled his mother, say Russian reports of the case, which is centred on Angarsk in the Irkutsk region of Siberia. Police earlier said that of the 29 he was suspected of killing, 25 were aged 19 to 28, and four were from 35 to 40. 'He beheaded at least one woman and gouged the heart out of a victim,' reported The Siberian Times. 'Popkov claimed he suddenly stopped killing after he ""became impotent"", suggesting a sexual motive to his murder spree. 'Typically, his victims were slightly intoxicated when he lured them to their deaths. 'He snared them after they had been to bars or parties. He is suspected of seeking revenge on his mother who was an alcoholic and allegedly abused him in his childhood.' Victim: Viktoria Chagaeva holds a picture of her 20-year-old sister Tanya Martynova, who was killed by Popkov after attending a concert with a friend in 1998 . Friends: The bodies of Yulia Kuprikova (left) and Tanya Martynova were found by a shepherd in an Angarsk suburb in 1998 . Investigators have established his killing spree lasted from 1992 until at least 2000, but have been unable to prove any killings since then. Popkov was finally arrested in June 2012 after around 3,500 police officers, serving and retired, were forced to take DNA tests. He told officers: 'I just felt I wanted to kill a woman I was giving a lift to in my car.' The Siberian Times goes on to say: 'He murdered the women with a slipknot, knife, awl, screwdriver or an axe which he used up to 17 times on some victims. 'He used his police uniform and car to gain the trust of at least some of his victims.' Tragedy: Tanya's mother Lubov (pictured with Tanya's daughter) died aged 66 in 2007 after becoming overcome with grief following her daughter's death . Torn apart: Viktoria Chagaeva (left) at the age of 16 with her sister Tanya and mother Lyubov . Only one victim, known only as Svetlana M, escaped his brutal attack when he left her for dead naked in the snow in midwinter. She told how an officer in a police car gave her a lift, then took her to the forest where he forced her to strip before crashing her head against a tree trunk. The police did not investigate properly after Popkov's wife Elena, now 47, who claimed he was a perfect husband and father, gave him an alibi. Innocent: Yulia Kuprikova, who was murdered with her friend Tanya Martynova . She also served in the police, and the couple have a daughter Ekaterina, now 26, a schoolteacher. Former policeman Nikolai Kitaev, who has criticised the handling of the case, said that Svetlana M was shown a picture of Popkov 'and clearly confirmed it was him' but investigators chose to believe Popkov's wife. Kitaev is convinced there are at least a dozen more cases in police files that are likely to be Popkov's victims. Many of the details from the crime scenes match his modus operandi, he said. After leaving the force, Popkov became . a security officer but bought and sold cars on the side, and frequently . travelled to and from Vladivostok on Russia's Pacific coast. 'He had plenty of opportunity for other killings but this has not been checked by police,' said one source. Earlier, . as policed fumbled to find the killer, a detective predicted that they . must be dealing with someone who 'is charming and sociable. Women like . him but he is a beast inside, and it is always hard to fight a . werewolf.' Tatiana (Tanya) Martynova, 20, was found dead with her friend Yulia Kuprikova, 19, on 29 October 1998 in an Angarsk suburb. 'It . happened 15 years ago, but the pain does not go away - it was me who . gave Tanya a ticket to go to a concert, and she was killed after . attending it,' said her sister Viktoria Chagaeva, 46, who owns a beauty . salon in Angarsk. Tanya was married with a child and was having a rare night out. Their bodies were found by a shepherd. 'It was 1am when Tanya's husband Igor and I came to the police,' she said. Murdered: An obituary notice for Maria Molotkova, 20, was found dead in the forest after going missing on 17 August 1999 . Another of Popkov's victims: A police appeal for Yulia Shapovalova after she went missing . 'Igor was absolutely devastated and only repeated - ""She was killed, she was killed"". 'I was shocked too, but I simply could not believe it and replied - ""what are you talking about?"" 'Later, we were told that their bodies were found next to each other, both girls were raped, cut and chopped.' Popkov has also been accused of raping the corpses of his victims. Chagaeva added: 'The experts told us that at first they were killed then raped. 'My elder brother Oleg went to the morgue to identify Tanya. He had flown from Moscow immediately. 'He . felt sick when saw the body, she was so mutilated. He was almost green . when he came out of there - he just could not say a word. 'I did not dare to go in and look.' Preyed on: The funeral of friends Marina Lyzhina, 35 (left) and Liliya Pashkovskaya, 37 (right) who were picked up by Popkov in his police car as they were returning from a night out . Cut down in their prime: Marina Lyzhina, 35 and Lilia Pashkovskaya, 37, were buried on 8 June 2000 . After the concert, the two women had been for a drink. Like almost all his victims, he targeted women who had taken alcohol. Their mother Lubov died early, aged 66 in 2007, unable to cope with the trauma, she said. 'She . felt as if she had died with Tanya, life became useless for her. She . lived only because she was visiting various mediums one by one, looking . for the killer and wasting her money. Viktoria Chagaeva . 'Nobody gave her any serious information but she kept doing it.' After . Popkov's arrest last year, Viktoria realised she vaguely knew the . killer. They had both been involved in biathlon at the same sports . ground. 'I was stuck with horror when I saw the picture of this maniac in the paper and online,' she said. 'My sister's killer was looking into my eyes. I immediately felt as if I'd met him. Looking at him, I could hardly breathe. 'Some . minutes later I looked at him another time and thought - oh my God, I . know him. I was so shocked, I even took a knife and cut his face in the . newspaper, I needed to let this horror out of me. 'I remember him as a tall slim man, he was always alone, with a slippery and shifty glance.' Dumping ground: A road near the town of Meget where bodies of Tanya and her friend Yulia were found . Intercepted: The block of flats in Angarsk where Tanya Martynova failed to return after she was targeted by Popkov after attending a concert . Dmitry, . a former police colleague of Popkov's, said: 'When I read about him in . the press I literally choked, because I used to work with him and . thought I knew him. 'He was an absolutely normal man... he liked biathlons... once on duty he shot a rapist during an arrest. There was an investigation and he was not punished, the chiefs considered he had taken fair action.' Angarsk psychiatrist Alexander Grishin said: 'The fact that only drunk women attracted him could be the result of his childhood problems and associations - his mother used to drink alcohol and often abused him. 'Maybe in his childhood other drunk women abused him too, and all this affected his behaviour later in his adult life and led to such horrible consequences.' Among Popkov's other victims were Maria Molotkova, 20, who worked at a water pumping station in Angarsk. She was found dead in the forest after going missing on 17 August 1999. Friends Marina Lyzhina, 35 and Lilia Pashkovskaya, 37, were buried on 8 June 2000 after he picked them up in his police car in the middle of the night as they were returning from a night out.","Mikhail Popkov, 49, stabbed or strangled women over at least eight years .

"After a 200-mile journey, former Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle was buried on Tuesday as his family members and fellow SEALS looked on amid the sounds of drums and bagpipes. A giant Texas flag flew at half-mast over the Texas State Cemetery in Austin as Kyle,  considered to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, was laid to rest. Kyle,  37, who completed four tours in Iraq and wrote the best-selling book 'American Sniper' was shot dead by a fellow veteran along with a friend earlier this month while at a North Texas gun range. Scroll down for video . Hundreds in line: A motorcade of about 200 vehicles accompanied the white hearse carrying slain former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle's flag-draped coffin in Midlothian, Texas on Tuesday . Respects: Hundreds lined up along his journey to pay their respects to the man described as the deadliest sniper in the U.S.' history . Taken: Kyle, 37, who completed four tours in Iraq and wrote the best-selling book 'American Sniper' was shot dead along with a friend earlier this month while at a North Texas gun range . Supporters: American flags and hand-made signs lined Interstate 35 as the funeral procession passed through Waco, Texas, making the final journey to Austin, where Kyle would be buried . A white hearse carrying Kyle's . flag-draped coffin was among 200 vehicles in a procession that left . Tuesday morning from Kyle's hometown of Midlothian, about 25 miles . southwest of Dallas. Many motorists pulled to the side of roads to watch the procession that included motorcycles, motor coaches, police cruisers and other vehicles throughout moments of light rain and even hail. Larry Key, one of about 100 Patriot Guard Riders who gathered for the event, said he came in tribute to Kyle's service. 'It's our way of honoring Chris and his family,' said Key, a Vietnam veteran from Denton. In Austin, hundreds of people gathered on roads stretching nearly a mile from the cemetery. Many who came to watch the procession were combat veterans in leather jackets who parked their motorcycles three wide around the permitted area of the gravesite. Others were businessmen in suits on their lunch break from the nearby Capitol, families with strollers and at least one jogger taking a break from an afternoon run. Riders: Some of around 100 Patriot Guard Riders leaded the long funeral procession as they traveled south along Interstate 35 . Respects: A man standing along Interstate 35 salutes in the rain as the hearse carrying the remains of the slain former Navy SEAL passed . Heartfelt goodbyes: Among the flags held high in Kyle's memory were signs of support for his family, including his wife and two young children he leaves behind . Lining up: In Austin, hundreds of people gathered on roads stretching nearly a mile from the cemetery . Mike Lamb, 24, stood about a half-mile from the cemetery wearing a mustard yellow Marine Corps shirt and holding a sign that read, 'Fair Winds and Calm Seas Frogman! R.I.P.' Lamb said he called in sick from work to see the procession. Because of that, he was at first reluctant to give his name. But he then rationalized that it didn't matter. Next month, Lamb is leaving for boot camp in the Marines. '(Kyle) was the last person that I would have expected to end up like that,' Lamb said. 'Because he was so into Wounded Warriors and helping soldiers with (post-traumatic stress disorder). He was a warrior overseas and at home.' An Iraq War veteran, Eddie Ray Routh, 25, has been charged in the killings of Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield. Routh's brother-in-law told authorities that Routh had recently been diagnosed with PTSD. Resilience: Bruce McLeod of Plano, Texas, is pelted by hail stones as he waits for the funeral procession to pass under the Interstate 35 overpass in Waxahachie . Tears: Tracy and Lucinda Larimore, of Henderson, Nevada, embraced after the procession passed them in Kyle's hometown of Midlothian, Texas . Same heart: Among those who turned out were nearby residents, combat veterans, men and women in business suits, Boy Scouts and at least one man and future Marine who called in sick from work to pay his respects . Goodbyes: People lined up, braving the cold and rain, from young to old to say their goodbyes and pay their respects . Riders: About 100 Patriot Guard Riders gathered to show their support while many other motorcyclists were combat veterans in leather jackets who parked their motorcycles three wide around the permitted area of the gravesite . Authorities say Kyle, Littlefield and Routh arrived together at the Rough Creek Lodge shooting range, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, on the afternoon of Feb. 2. Routh later fled in Kyle's truck. According to a search warrant, Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that the men 'were out shooting target practice and he couldn't trust them so he killed them before they could kill him.' On Monday, some 7,000 people attended a two-hour memorial service for Kyle at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington. Kyle's coffin was placed at the Dallas Cowboys' star at midfield. Crowds queued to enter the Cowboys . Stadium so they could hear memories of a kind and loving family man, a . practical joker and a proud veteran. His widow, Taya Kyle, told the crowd she was broken but that her family would 'put one foot in front of the other' to get through their grief. She said she told her two children that they will remember Kyle's silly side, Texas twang and the prayers they prayed together. Mourners: On Monday a large crowd packed a memorial service to Kyle in the Cowboys stadium . Honored: Taya Kyle and her children walked behind the coffin of her husband Chris Kyle during his memorial service in Dallas . Tribute: The Cowboys stadium was a fitting venue . for the memorial to Kyle, a proud Texan. Heart-breaking messages, . right, from his children aged 8 and 6 were printed onto the ceremony . program . Heartbreaking: . Letters to Chris Kyle from his young children were printed on the . memorial program which also carried the couple's wedding picture . 'Thank you Chris thank you for loving me, all of me,' his wife said through tears. 'God worked through you to make me the woman I was supposed to be...You taught me I was okay just the way I am. 'I stand before you a broken woman . but I am now and always will be a wife of a man who was a warrior both . on and off the battlefield.' The couple's children wrote heart-breaking tributes to him on the memorial program alongside . pictures of their parents wedding day. 'You are the best dad ever. I never . wanted you to die, I miss your heart', one of the messages simply signed . by 'Baby Girl' from Kyle's daughter read. The other signed by 'Bubba' added: 'One of the best things that has happened to me is you. I love you dad. I always will.' Eddie Ray Routh has been charged over . the shootings - it is alleged the murdered pair were trying to help the . marine corporal recover from PTSD by taking him out for the day. Paying . respects: Thousands queued to join a memorial service to former Navy . Seal Chris Kyle. The author of 'American Sniper' was shot earlier this . month on a shooting range in Texas . Tearful: Many of those paying tribute to Chris Kyle broke down. His wife Taya, pictured, bravely shared her memories of her husband . Courage: Taya Kyle made a heartfelt tribute to her husband. Through her tears she told of how much her husband supported her . Kyle, who also received two Silver Stars, had worked tirelessly to support his fellow comrades since leaving the Navy in 2009. The man dubbed the 'most lethal . sniper in U.S. history' after killing 150 was the founder of a . non-profit supporting veterans providing them with fitness equipment. He and Littlefield, . who wasn't a military man, regularly took veterans to the shooting range . in order to support them. Littlefield's funeral was held Friday in . Midlothian. Afterward, Littlefield's relatives said the outing with . Routh was intended to be therapeutic. On Monday Taya Kyle took a moment in her tribute to remind her children how important they were to their father. 'I cherish the look on you dad's face . when you would both come running across the house to take a flying leap . into his arms,' she said. 'I hope you know with all your heart that being your dad . was the highlight of his life.' 'You made him feel like the best dad in the world...You loved him in a way that was different to any way he has ever known.' Selfless: The mother of a soldier killed in Iraq told the memorial service of how Kyle selflessly offered her the proceeds of his best-selling book to support her family.

"Tragic: David Evans, 23, was crushed to death by a two-ton block of limestone while renovating the home of former Pizza Express boss, Hugh Osmond . The family of a builder who was crushed to death by a two-ton block of limestone spoke of their grief today as the masonry firm he worked for was convicted of corporate manslaughter. David Evans, 23, was struck by the huge rock while renovating the sprawling £20million home of former Pizza Express boss, Hugh Osmond, near Moulsford, Oxfordshire. He was airlifted to hospital with 'catastrophic injuries' to his chest and abdomen, but was pronounced dead later the same day. Earlier today, Cavendish Masonry Limited, who employed Mr Evans, was found guilty of corporate manslaughter by a jury at Oxford Crown Court. The court heard that the firm had committed a gross breach in its duty of care in its management and organisation of the work on Mr Osmond's 1,200-acre Well Barn Estate. It had failed to take reasonable care in the planning and execution of those activities, the jury concluded. And now, Mr Evans's family have spoken of their heartbreak over the death of their relative, whom they have described as 'profoundly honest' with an 'infectious laugh'. In a statement, they said: 'We . miss his smile, his infectious laugh and his profoundly honest nature. Not a single day passes without us thinking of him and wondering what . his life and our lives would have been like were he here today. 'While . we know that this trial will not bring David back to us, we now know . how and why he was taken from us, how and why his promising life was cut . so tragically short and how and why he will never be able to fulfil the . potential that so many have attested to him having. 'We hope that this trial and the conclusions that are reached serve as an example to others in the industry.' Mr Evans, from Tilehurst, Reading, had been building a 'rustic wall' on Mr Osmond's estate after being taken . on by Cavendish Masonry as a stonemason’s mate because he was a good worker. Scene: Mr Evans was struck by the huge rock as he worked on the sprawling £20million site (pictured) near Moulsford, Oxfordshire. He was airlifted to hospital with 'catastrophic injuries', but died later the same day . Building work: Cavendish Masonry Limited was today convicted of the corporate manslaughter of Mr Evans (left) by a jury at Oxford Crown Court. Right, Mr Osmond, whose home the stonemason's mate was renovating . He was struck by the limestone slab and pinned to a set of stairs for five to 20 seconds after it . toppled from its lintel as it was being . lifted into place by a crane on February 9, 2010. The . worker was treated at the scene by colleagues by paramedics, before . being airlifted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. However, he was . pronounced dead later that day. At . an earlier trial, prosecutors alleged the strops on the crane had been . slackened off - meaning the limestone had been held in place by only its own weight. They also described the rock as being like 'an . enormous free-standing bathroom tile'. Mansion: The court heard that Cavendish Masonry Ltd had committed a gross breach in its duty of care in its management and organisation of the work on Mr Osmond's 1,200-acre Well Barn Estate (pictured) 'Honest': Mr Evans's family have spoken of their relative's 'profoundly honest' nature and 'infectious laugh' Oliver Glasgow, prosecuting, told the jury: 'The decision had been taken not to use any . fixings to hold the stone in place, therefore when the strops [a short . rope whose ends are spliced together to make a ring] on the crane were . slackened off, the only thing that held it there was its own weight. 'Since . it was top-heavy and its width was not uniform and it was balanced on . two concrete blocks, it was inevitable it would topple.' He . said tests on the block had found that because . of its irregular shape, only a matter of millimetres which could . decide whether it was stable or not. 'The specialist inspectors from Health and Safety Executive considered the absence of restraint as being very serious,' he said. Sign: Cavendish Masonry Ltd is due to be sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on a forthcoming date . 'They . identified fixing the stones in place before the strops were let off . was an essential part of the operation and absence was a significant . error. 'It was . concluded this was a result of a complete lack of planning and the work . of Cavendish Masonry fell significantly below the standard expected of . someone carrying out such a lifting operation.' Mr Glasgow added: 'It would appear no real thought or planning had gone into the operation itself. 'Cavendish . Masonry did almost nothing to ensure the lifting operation was done . safely. The dangers it posed were obvious and they had been alerted by . an email from the architect.' The work on the 1,200-acre country estate included demolishing the . estate manager’s home, a cottage, garages and a barn - and replacing them with a . new family home. A timber barn was also being converted into an indoor pool, gym and office, with an underground garage. After . Mr Evans’ death, Mr Osmond, a former Pizza Express director, released a statement, saying: 'It is a . deeply tragic accident and we are obviously very shocked about it. All . our thoughts go out to the man’s family and friends.' The tycoon amassed his estimated £350million fortune through Punch Taverns and Pizza Express. Following today's verdict, HSE . Inspector Peter Snelgrove, who supported the police-led investigation, . said: 'David Evans' tragic death was completely avoidable had Cavendish . Masonry Limited properly planned and managed the installation of the . heavy limestone.' Cavendish Masonry Ltd is due to be sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on a date yet to be fixed.","David Evans, 23, crushed to death by two-ton block of limestone in 2010 .

"Jose Mourinho risked the wrath of the Football Association after claiming the ‘campaign’ against his side is still going on and could cost Chelsea the Premier League title. Mourinho was incensed after being held 1-1 at home by Burnley on Saturday, claiming a string of decisions by referee Martin Atkinson cost his side dearly, with Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic set to miss next Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Tottenham after being sent off after 69 minutes. Mourinho felt Ashley Barnes should have been sent off for the challenge that prompted Matic to retaliate by pushing the Burnley striker over, and should also have seen red for an earlier push on Branislav Ivanovic. And Mourinho’s sense of injustice was not helped by two penalty claims that were ignored, when Michael Kightly handled an Ivanovic shot in the 33rd minute, and then when Burnley skipper Jason Shackell pushed Diego Costa to the ground shortly before half-time. Jose Mourinho (centre) refused to comment on Nemanja's Matic's red card against Burnley but says four incidents were crucial . Chelsea's boss identified the minutes 30, 33, 43 and 69 and thinks they 'wrote the story of the game' in his post-match interview . Last month, Mourinho was fined £25,000 and warned about his future conduct after speaking in December about a ‘campaign’ against Chelsea, and was further incensed when Diego Costa received a three-match ban for stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can soon afterwards. So he chose his words carefully  and spoke cryptically about the incidents, outlining the minute that each perceived injustice happened rather than describing them or the players involved in detail. He told Sky Sports: 'I think there are four moments of the game where you can write the story of the game. Minute 30, minute 33, minute 43 and minute 69.I repeat for you, I make it easy for you. Minute 30, 33, 43 and 69. The game had four moments and don't ask me more questions because I don't answer.' In a separate interview with BBC Sport, Mourinho carried on refusing to comment on the match. 'I just say that I believe in spite of some clear callers you guys are all honest people and professional people and I believe that sometimes the callers they can disturb a little bit the truth. But I truly believe that you are all honest people.' The tackle infuriated Matic and Mourinho but Barnes got away unpunished despite how high his studs are up the Serb's leg . 'After these four moments I am surprised that we didn't lose all three points. 'I am in no mood to laugh.' The incidents in question are thought to be involve Barnes' tackles and two penalty appeals which were turned down. The main talking point will be Matic's straight red card after 69 minutes. The Serbian midfielder pushed Ashley Barnes to the floor which saw him receive the red card after the striker's horror tackle . Matic reacts angrily after Barnes's terrible challenge on him could have seriously injured him but he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final . 30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken. Verdict: Should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes. The Burnley forward clatters into the Serbian defender which infuriated the Chelsea players during the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge . 33 - Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. Verdict: Should have been a Chelsea penalty. Ivanovic fires at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of Michael Kightly but no penalty was awarded . 43 - Diego Costa tumbles to the ground after Burnley captain Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. Verdict: Could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been very soft. Costa vents his frustration on the ground after his appeal for a penalty was turned down by the referee following Shackell's push . 69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over violently. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. Verdict: Shocking tackle merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick. The Serbian midfielder was led away by his teammates as Martin Atkinson shows him a red card for his push on Barnes . The Serbian midfielder was caught by a nasty challenge from the Burnley forward and reacted angrily by pushing him to the floor in front of the referee. When asked about the sending off the Chelsea boss simply responded. ‘That was the minute 69 and it had a big relation with minute 30,’ said Mourinho. ‘Normally the player, if I can call him a player, was involved in minute 30 and normally by minute 31 he should be in the shower. No minute 69 if the person in charge does the things in the proper way in minute 30.’ When pushed on the matter the usually fiery Mourinho simply refused to comment. He said: 'I can't do that because I'm punished when I refer to these situations. I don't want to be punished. Mourinho was clearly keen on avoiding another hefty fine after being fined £25,000 for comments claiming that there was a 'campaign to influence referees.' The Chelsea boss made the comment after his side were denied a penalty after Cesc Fabregas was adjudged to have dived in the box in the 1-1 draw with Southampton on 28 December. He told BBC Sport: 'The media, commentators, other managers are all doing it [putting pressure on referees].' 'There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don't know why there is this campaign and I do not care. 'Everybody knows it was a penalty.' Diego Costa looks bemused after Martin Atkinson refused to award him a penalty after a tussle with Shackell in the penalty box . Barnes was also involved in another incident after catching goalscorer Branislav Ivanovic in the back with a high foot - which happened in one of the minutes Mourinho mentioned. The other minutes in questions are believed to be about the two penalty appeals Chelsea had waved away. On 33 minutes, Ivanovic's shot struck Michael Kightly on the arm but Martin Atkinson said no. Branislav Ivanovic screams in pain after being fouled by Barnes in the first half - which was an incident Mourinho mentioned . Then just before half-time, Diego Costa was pushed over in the box by Jason Shackell but once again the referee refused to give it - much to the bemusement of the home side. When asked again Mourinho continued to keep his mouth closed. 'I don't describe. To describe I have to use words that I cannot use. It's better we finish here. 'You do want you want to do, you speak what you want to speak. You are not punished by that - I am. 'I don't want to look silly in front of you but I have to repeat 30,33, 43 and 69. I have nothing more to say.' Ben Mee equalises for Burnley, climing above Ramires at the far post to head past the Chelsea defence - not long after Matic's sending off . 30 - Chelsea's website highlighted the decisions Mourinho was talking about and clearly thought Barnes fouled Ivanovic. 33 - Not holding back, they were convinced Kightly handled the ball in the box following the Serbian's shot at goal and appear to feel hard done by. 43 - 'Clear' seems to be their thoughts on the penalty decisions and feel that Costa was 'pushed to the ground' but the referee didn't seem agree. 69 - A very angry Chelsea state that Barnes' tackle was 'potentially leg-breaking,' which doesn't seem to be far off the mark. Chelsea were frank about how they thought the decisions should have gone and didn't hold back on the Barnes tackle .","Jose Mourinho carefully chose his comments on Nemanja Matic's sending off for reacting to Ashley Barnes' tackle .

"It's not just humans that are to blame for global warming - natural activity from the sun also has an impact on climate change. This is according to a Swedish research team that has reconstructed the sun's activity at the end of the last ice age, around 20,000 to 10,000 years ago. The study shows that the sun's variation influences the climate regardless of whether the climate is extreme, as it was during the Ice Age, or moderate, as it is today. Researchers in Sweden have, for the first time, shown how solar activity affected the last ice age 20,000 to 10,000 years ago. They say the sun influences the climate regardless of whether it is extremely cold or more moderate like today . However the researchers do not say solar . activity is the sole cause of the current warming of our planet, which . most scientists agree is being accelerated by human activities. The researchers from Lund University in Sweden came to their conclusion by analysing trace elements in ice cores in Greenland and cave formations from China. Europe: The IPCC expects damage to the Mediterranean. This will increase energy costs and damage tourism from 2050. North America: Flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms moving north of New York. Asia: The majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be in southern and eastern Asia. Australasia: There remains uncertainty about impact in Australasia, but extreme weather is predicted. Africa: Food security will be a major issue for Africa. Crops and livestock will be affected by both flooding and drought. Central and South America: Scientists expect Northern Brazil may lose 22 per cent of its annual rainfall by 2100. Their research shows that the regional climate is influenced by the sun and offers opportunities to better predict future climate conditions in certain regions. Dr Raimund Muscheler, lecturer in Quaternary Geology at Lund University and co-author of the study, told MailOnline that solar activity in the modern day was causing about 0.1 degrees of warming in the 11-year solar cycle. 'Bit it's quite debated how much it really contributed in the last 100 years, since solar activity increased a bit,' Dr Muscheler says. 'The long trend is debated, but most people don't think it's much more than 0.1 degrees.' However, he warned that the sun was not the only factor in causing climate change. 'Climate skeptics like to say sun is causing more global . warming than we think but I don’t . think so. 'What our paper shows is we need to include all processes - greenhouses, the sun and so on, especially for local climates which is . important of course. During the last glacial maximum, Sweden was covered in a thick ice sheet that stretched all the way down to northern Germany and sea levels were more than 330ft (100m) lower than they are today, because the water was frozen in the extensive ice caps. 'The study shows an unexpected link between solar activity and climate change,' Dr Muscheler said in a press release. 'It shows both that changes in solar activity are nothing new and that solar activity influences the climate, especially on a regional level. 'Understanding these processes helps us to better forecast the climate in certain regions.' Dr Joanna Haigh, Professor of Atmospheric Physics at Imperial College London, tells MailOnline that the research is interesting but people should not jump to any conclusions. 'This is a very nice careful piece of work which provides evidence from Greenland, over a period 10,000-25,000 years ago, consistent with a picture that has emerged from other studies looking at changes over more recent times,' she says. 'This shows that when the sun is less active winters are likely to be warmer in Greenland and colder in Northwest Europe. 'It is not easy to draw any conclusions from this work with regard to the sun’s role in global warming or the recent slowdown in warming of global air temperature.' The study claims that that sun could be influencing climate change today. However they do not say the sun is the only factor in climate change. Most scientists agree human activity is causing the planet to warm faster . The sun’s impact on the climate is a matter of current debate. There is still a lot of uncertainty as to how the sun affects the climate, but the study suggests that direct solar energy is not the most important factor, but rather it indirectly affects atmospheric circulation. 'Reduced solar activity could lead to colder winters in Northern Europe,' said Dr Muscheler. 'This is because the sun’s UV radiation affects the atmospheric circulation. 'Interestingly, the same processes lead to warmer winters in Greenland, with greater snowfall and more storms. 'The study also shows that the various solar processes need to be included in climate models in order to better predict future global and regional climate change.'","Researchers in Sweden have, for the first time, shown how solar activity affected the last ice age 20,000 to 10,000 years ago .

"Guilty: Thomas Dunkley has been found guilty of murdering ex-WBA light-middleweight boxer Shaun Cummins . A carer who murdered a former boxing champion and dismembered his body with a chainsaw before storing the parts in freezers at his home, was today sentenced to life in prison. Thomas Dunkley, 29, killed Shaun Cummins, 45, before stealing more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight and storing his body parts in freezers at his bungalow. Mr Cummins who was nicknamed ‘The Guvnor’ had received a £400,000 payout in 2004 following a road accident that left him paralysed from the waist down. Leicester Crown Court heard . debt-ridden Dunkley had given up his job to look after Mr Cummins - but, . after two years, still hadn’t received a penny in return. Jurors were told he spent over . £10,000 of Mr Cummins’ cash after the killing ‘without a care in the . world’, splashing out on a new car and clothes. He also transferred £15,000 from a trust fund set up for the former sportsman. But Dunkley was arrested when a . suspicious nurse who used to visit Mr Cummins at his home told police . she hadn’t seen him for days - and officers forced their way in before . making the grim discovery. Mr Cummins’ body had been cut into . ten pieces and wrapped in binliners sealed with duct tape, then stored . in three separate freezers - one of which Dunkley had bought . specifically for the task. The court heard that when interviewed . by detectives, he claimed Mr Cummins had died of natural causes and . admitted cutting up his body - but said he could not explain why. Dunkley was told he must serve a least 34 years before he can apply for parole. Judge Mrs Justice Dobbs told him: 'In . my judgement this was a murder for gain. The dismemberment of the body . was a grotesque act, violating Mr Cummins as a person, and his dignity . in death.' Scroll down for video . Death: Thomas Dunkley, 29, allegedly murdered Shaun Cummins, . 45, then stole more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight . boxer and stored his body parts at his bungalow . Gruesome: The dismembered body of Shaun Cummin was found by police at his home in Saffron Lance, Leicestershire . The court heard that because of the dismemberment, it was impossible to say how he had died. Dunkley, of no fixed address, denied murder but admitted preventing a lawful burial by cutting Mr Cummins’ body up. He has also pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud, relating to accessing Mr Cummins’ funds after his death. Mr Cummins, who also worked as a . bodyguard for the boyband Blue before his accident, retired from boxing . in 1995 with a record of 22 wins, six defeats and a draw. He became the Inter-continental Light . Middleweight champion in 1992 by defeating Steve Foster, then . successfully defended his title a year later against Mickey Hughes. William Harbage QC, prosecuting, said Dunkley, 29, and Mr Cummins met in 2007 through a mutual friend who ran a boxing club. He told the hearing that initially, Dunkley was simply ‘someone for MrCummins to play computer games with’. Former boxer: Shaun Cummins (right) on the attack against Tony Velinor (left) 23 years ago in January 1990 . But Mr Harbage added: 'In the last . two years of his life, Thomas Dunkley effectively became his full-time . carer. By August 2012, he was a continuous presence at his home.' The court heard Mr Cummins, who was virtually bed-ridden, received daily visits from community nurses. But Mr Harbage said Dunkley was . constantly on standby with to change the bedsheets, take delivery of . medication, and run other errands. He was also trusted to deal with . financial transactions, as well as the handling of blank cheques from a . trust fund set up after Mr Cummins’ accident. It still held a balance of . £44,000 at the time of his death. Flowers in tribute: Police made the gruesome find on September 12 last year after concerned nurses who cared for the paraplegic contacted the police . Mr Harbage told the jury: “It appears no payment was made to Thomas Dunkley for his time. 'He owed £16,500 to creditors, and at . the time, his personal debts were increasing. It appears he had been . hoping there would be some financial recompense, either through a direct . payment or a share in the profits of a business venture Mr Cummins had . embarked on.” However, Mr Harbage said it was . accepted Mr Cummins could be ‘strong-willed and overbearing’, and ‘took . advantage’ of Dunkley, who felt ‘bullied’. The court heard that in the days . before the alleged killing, Dunkley told a mutual friend that he ‘had . had enough of Mr Cummins and was getting away from him because he had . wrecked his life over the past couple of years.’ He said: “In this case, we point to . the background of bullying, the attraction of the defendant in helping . himself to the remaining financial resources of Mr Cummins, and the . desire to break free from the man who had made his life a misery. 'It may be any one of these motives or a combination that caused Thomas Dunkley to act as he did.' Mr Harbage said that apart from . Dunkley, the last person to see Mr Cummins alive was a community nurse . on September 1 last year. He added that it was impossible to . say when he died - but it was ‘most likely’ to have been either later . that day, or the following day. The jury heard that on September 1, . Dunkley carried out a number of internet searches including ‘what . happens when you are stabbed in the stomach’, ‘how long does it take to . die after being stabbed’, and ‘what is the fastest way for a human to bleed to death’. And 24 hours later, Mr Harbage said . he ‘intercepted’ community nurses outside the bungalow, falsely telling . them Mr Cummins had been admitted to hospital. The court heard that by September 4, . Dunkley began using Mr Cummins’ bank accounts. In total, he either spent . or withdrew a total of £10,819. It was claimed that by September 6, . Dunkley had decided to cut up Mr Cummins’ body, which had started to . decompose, and store it in freezers ‘while he worked out what to do’. Mr Harbage said he bought a chainsaw . and incinerator, as well as overalls, dust sheets, binliners, duct tape, . a face mask and goggles. Investigation: Dunkley allegedly dismembered the body after killing Mr Cummins and placed the parts in bin bags before sealing them with duct tape and putting them in the freezer at his home in Leicester (pictured) The prosecutor added that neighbours . saw smoke and noticed a ‘horrible smell’ in the air as Dunkley burned . items in the back garden. He also bought a chest freezer as the . two already in the house weren’t big enough to store Mr Cummins’ body - . a fact he later admitted to the police. Jurors were told Dunkley was then . seen over the next few days by a several witnesses ‘without a care in . the world’ as he shopped for clothes. But by September 12 a community nurse . realised she hadn’t seen Mr Cummins for days - and, after quizzing . Dunkley about his whereabouts, alerted the police. Mr Harbage said Dunkley watched from a parked car as officers arrived to search the bungalow - then ‘fled’ Leicester. He was arrested at Wooley Edge services on the M1 near Wakefield in Yorkshire the next day. Dunkley denied murder between September 1 and 9 last year. He was also convicted of using Mr Cummins credit card and taking out a payday loan in his name in the months before his death.

"Smartly dressed in his school uniform, the 12-year-old boy is a picture of youthful innocence. But within two years of this photograph being taken, Peter Hatton-Bornshin’s life had been ripped apart. He was orphaned following his mother’s suicide and then suffered appalling sexual abuse while in the care of social services in the early 1980s. Tormented by his experience at the council-run Grafton Close Children’s Home in West London, Peter took his own life in 1994. He was 28. 'Youthful innocence': Peter Hatton-Bornshin, who was in the care of the Grafton Close Children's Home as a teenager, took his own life at the age of 28 . The first picture of Peter, whose tragic life was revealed by the Mail last Saturday, emerged today as two men were arrested by detectives investigating allegations that a VIP paedophile ring preyed on Grafton Close boys at the gay-friendly Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London. A former deputy head of Grafton Close, John Stingemore, 70, was detained during a dawn raid at his housing association flat in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, over claims he sexually abused several boys in his care three decades ago. A Roman Catholic priest from Norfolk – Father Tony McSweeney, 66 – was also arrested on suspicion of indecently assaulting boys at Grafton Close. McSweeney officiated at the 1990 wedding of boxer Frank Bruno and his former wife Laura, and was the ‘part-time’ chaplain at Norwich City Football Club. Priest: Father Tony McSweeney, who officiated at the wedding of boxer Frank Bruno and his former wife Laura in 1990, has been arrested on suspicion of child abuse . Detectives are probing claims that several Establishment figures – including senior politicians, pop stars and police employees – abused under-age rent boys and children from Grafton Close at the Elm Guest House. Scotland Yard launched the child sex abuse inquiry, codenamed Operation Fernbridge, after Labour MP Tom Watson made a string of sensational allegations in the Commons last October. Former home: Detectives are investigating allegations of child abuse at the then Elm Guest House in Barnes (pictured) Run by Indian-born Haroon ‘Harry’ Kasir and his German wife Carole, Elm Guest House was openly advertised in the gay press in the 1980s as a place where homosexual men could meet. Mrs Kasir died in 1990. Shortly after her death, a campaigner from the National Association of Young People in Care called for a criminal investigation into the case. He said he had been told by Mrs Kasir that boys had been brought in from a children’s home for sex. She had told him she had photographs or video of many Establishment figures at her hotel, including a bishop. One photograph allegedly showed a former cabinet minister in a sauna with a naked boy. Peter Hatton-Bornshin received ‘substantial compensation’ following his ordeal at Grafton Close. Tonight his stepfather, who asked not to be named, said he had placed Peter and his elder brother into care after their mother’s suicide in 1980. He said: ‘Every time I visited Peter in the home he was happy. ‘He never said a word about anyone being abused. There was no unhappiness whatsoever. When he came to stay with us, he was always laughing and joking. ‘It makes me shudder now with what has come out.' ‘Peter looked younger than what he was and was a kind of Peter Pan character. He was a bit childish and found it hard to form relationships with girls.’ Detained: Detectives arrested Stingemore, 70, seen left, centre, being escorted by police, and Catholic priest McSweeney, 66, right, over child abuse allegations dating back to the 1980s . Ceremony: McSweeney, left, presided over boxer Frank Bruno's 1990 wedding to his former wife Laura . He said Peter had no interests at all, such as supporting a football team or other typical teenage pursuits, which he put down to his behavioural problems during childhood. He added: ‘Peter was always the blue-eyed boy in my eyes but he did act and look younger than his age. I just think he was very immature. When he was 20 he behaved like a 14-year-old.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Anyone who has been affected by or has information about activity in the early 1980s at the Elm Guest House or the Grafton Close care home should speak to the NSPCC on their helpline on 0808 800 5000, or their local police.’ A spokesman for Richmond council, which ran the home, said: ‘As the investigation is on-going, it would be inappropriate to comment.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Peter Hatton-Bornshin suffered appalling sexual abuse as a child in care .

Frank Lampard has already won the Champions League during his illustrious career and believes his current side Manchester City will win the competition... eventually. The on-loan midfielder won the trophy with Chelsea in 2012 following a dramatic penalty shoot with Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena. And Lampard thinks that City are on the right track to pick up some European silverware but will need to get past Barcelona in the last 16. Frank Lampard (left) believes his Manchester City are capable of winning the Champions League . Lampard (centre) leads his teammates in training ahead of Saturday's clash at home to Newcastle . Speaking to Man City's website he said: 'This is a trophy every big club needs in their collection and the way City are heading it is one that will happen at some point. 'And these sorts of games are the ones you have to win if you are going to go on and win the competition. 'For me the Champions League is the best club competition in world football. 'Playing against a team like Barcelona and the greatest club teams in Europe when all the eyes of the world are on you is hard to beat.' Barcelona are City's opponents in the last 16 and they will need to be at their best to stop their front free . Lampard's been involved in many Champions League games during his career at Chelsea and came close on a number occasions to winning it - before that famous night in Munich. The midfielder scored in the 2008 final against Manchester United but ended up on the losing side after a cruel penalty shoot out defeat. 'I've had lots of good and bad experiences in the Champions League in that I've been knocked out in big games and had big decisions go the wrong way. Lampard scored against Manchester United in the final in 2008 but they lost the game on penalties . The midfielder describes his Champions League success as the 'best night of his career' 'There were many years when I was at Chelsea when success was very close – I think I've played in four or five semi-finals and also lost a final against Manchester United so to actually win it in 2012 was extra sweet and undoubtedly the best night of my career to date. 'I'd love to City do the same and I think it's the club's next step – there will be disappointments along the way and I know that there have been some hard times in this competition in recent years and Chelsea had many hard times as well – but that's what happens when you are up against the best. 'It is difficult to win against these teams – but to go on and win it you have to win matches like this. 'We have to be on the ball for both games against Barcelona because you're playing against such high quality that one lapse of concentration will cost you the game.'

"Rachel Evans, 36, pictured on today's This Morning where she admitted she's a chocoholic . Many people will be giving up chocolate for Lent but for one mother, the sacrifice will be especially difficult as she currently eats the treat morning, noon and night. Rachel Evans, 36, from Cardiff, appeared on today's This Morning where she revealed the full extent of her addiction. She said: 'I eat chocolate every day. I don't just eat one bar or one bag. I'll eat one and have another an hour later - family sized bags and bars, huge amounts of chocolate. 'I eat amounts that would make others physically sick. 'I'll have it mid morning, lunch time, afternoon, evening and on the sofa at night.' Rachel explained to presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley that she has loved chocolate 'for as long as I can remember.' She said: 'I was brought up to eat healthily and chocolate was just a treat. 'I used to be afraid of going to the dentist so I would be given it afterwards as a treat. When I moved out of home I started buying it for myself and it went from there.' She said she has no self-control when it comes to chocolate and she can consume a whole packet of chocolate biscuits or a chocolate cake in one sitting. 'I do feel guilty afterwards but not for long, so then I eat it again,' she said. While she was once successful in quitting smoking, she said attempts to give up chocolate have always failed. She said: ''It's totally addictive to me, I don't want to, there's no reason for it but I can't stop eating chocolate. 'People say ""don't keep it in the house, then you won't be able to eat it"" but I'll just drive to the shops and get some or eat it while I'm at work.' As she approaches Easter, her 'favourite time of year' because of all the chocolate eggs on offer, Rachel said she wants to be able to give up the treat once and for all. She said she's concerned about the effect her eating habits are having on her own health and the example she is setting her children. Scroll down for video . The mother pictured at home surrounded by some of the chocolate she'd eat on a daily basis . A selection of the chocolate in Rachel's kitchen. She said if she doesn't have any in the house, she'll just drive out to get some to satisfy her cravings . She said: 'It (chocolate) is beautiful but it's no good for me. I'm trying to lead a healthier life, I have lost weight and started running but I can't get rid of it. 'I'm worried about the impact on my children, I control what they eat but my six-year-old already asks me for chocolate when she sees me eating it. It's not good for the future in that sense.' She said she'd also save money on her shopping bills if she wasn't buying so much chocolate every week as she currently spends an 'awful' amount. Therapists The Speakmans on This Morning said they would be able to stop Rachel craving chocolate . The ITV show introduced Rachel to therapists The Speakmans who promised that they would be able to cure her using their techniques. Remarkably, when Rachel returned to the This Morning sofa an hour later, she said she was a new woman. A plate of chocolate cakes and bars were brought out and offered to her but she said she wasn't tempted at all. After a short session with The Speakmans, Rachel was able to resist this plate of chocolate offered to her . She said: 'I don't want to look at it, it doesn't appeal to me.' The mother cried in relief over the fact she no longer felt controlled by her need to eat chocolate. Nik and Eva Speakman said their techniques involved changing Rachel's perception of chocolate and the way she associated with a reward. They wanted to replace how Rachel felt about chocolate with how she felt about less appetising food - such as offal - so that just the thought of eating chocolate would become revolting. For anyone seeking to overcome an addiction to comfort eating, they recommend looking for alternatives so you don't feel deprived (eg replacing milk chocolate with dark chocolate or having chocolate sprinkles on a coffee rather than a chocolate bar), not buying the fattening products in the first place and not telling yourself you 'can't' have something - as denial will make you crave it more.","Rachel Evans, 36, says she addicted to chocolate .

"Cesar Azpilicueta has been in such impressive form this season that Chelsea TV found it fitting to name him twice in the starting line-up - at the expense of Branislav Ivanovic.

"Stevan Jovetic has accused Manuel Pellegrini of 'killing him' after the Chilean boss left him out of Manchester City's Champions League squad. The Montenegrin striker, who arrived from Fiorentina for £22million 18 months ago, was omitted from Pellegrini's European plans following the arrival of Wilfried Bony from Swansea. Jovetic insists Pellegrini has made a mistake in leaving him out of the squad and admits he will now asses his future at the club. Manchester City's Stevan Jovetic celebrates scoring against Swansea earlier in the season . The 25-year-old told mirror.co.uk: 'I deserve to play in the Champions League. I know that. 'The manager has killed me with this decision. I feel I deserve my place and other people have told me the same. 'People have told me I am a great player, but it is clear that the manager doesn't think the same way. 'I am very disappointed, even now. I don't think it was a good decision – or the right decision. 'I know that I deserve to be on the list. I told the manager this, but he didn't want to listen to me. I came here to play in the Champions League.' Wilfried Bony arrived at Manchester City last month from Premier League rivals in a big money deal . Bony's arrival meant the Montenegrin striker was omitted from Manuel Pellegrini's Champions League squad . Jovetic, who attracted interest from Italian duo Inter Milan and Juventus in January, added: 'I have not made any decision about my future. I will wait until the summer then we will see. 'But the manager has put other players ahead of me, so maybe this is a message about what he wants to do. 'It is difficult to be focused when something like this happens, but I am a professional and I want to show that I can still play a big part this season.

"The Department of Homeland Security was dragging its feet on processing Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev's U.S. citizenship after a routine background check revealed he had been questioned by the FBI in 2011. Tamerlan, 26, filed an application for citizenship six months ago but immigration officials had not yet made a decision on his case at the time of the Boston Marathon bombings. Authorities knew the alleged bomber had a domestic violence charge on his record but the fact he had been grilled by federal agents is reportedly what threw up red flags, halting the progress of his application. It's not clear what the 26-year-old, who was killed early Friday, was told about why his application was facing delays. Pending: Homeland Security hadn't granted US citizenship to Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured left in 2010, and right, last Monday, minutes before the attack . In custody: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is in critical condition at a Boston hospital after he was discovered Friday evening hiding in a boat in Watertown . Official reported on Friday that the . F.B.I. interviewed the older Tsarnaev brother in January 2011 at the . request of the Russian government, which suspected that he had ties to . Chechen terrorists. They said this decision to delay his . application proved his encounter with the F.B.I. did not go unnoticed by . the Department of Homeland security. According to The New York Times, the . terror suspect's application, presented on September 5, also prompted . the FBI to do 'additional investigation' of him this year. They didn't reveal how far the probe had gone or what it covered. Tamerlan's papers were submitted just days after his brother, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, had his own citizenship application approved. According to the Times, officials with Homeland Security contacted the FBI late last year to learn more about its interview with the terror suspect and the agency reported its conclusion that he did not present a threat. However, immigration officials did not move to approve or deny the application, choosing instead to leave it open for 'additional review.' On Sunday, U.S. lawmakers from both parties criticized the FBI for failing to spot the extremist leanings of Tamerlan Tsarnaev . and demanded to know why the agency did not at least follow up with the . elder brother following a six-month trip to Russia in 2012. Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-South . Carolina) went so far as to say 'the ball was dropped' by the federal . agency by either missing 'a lot of things' during their initial . investigation of the suspect or did not allow investigators to 'follow . up in a sound, solid way.' Outspoken: New York Sen. Charles Schumer, left, D-New York, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, raised questions on CNN over the FBI's follow-up on the elder Tsarnaev brother . Under . the barrage of attacks, the FBI has stood by their initial public . statement issued earlier last week, which said that the agency closed . their investigation on the ethnic Chechen in 2011 after failing to find . any ‘terrorism activity, domestic or foreign.’ On Sunday, House of Representatives . Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul wrote to the FBI and . other officials asking why Tamerlan Tsarnaev did not raise suspicions . after Russia asked the bureau to investigate him two years ago. 'Because if he was on the radar and . they let him go, he's on the Russians' radar, why wasn't a flag put on . him, some sort of customs flag?,' McCaul, a Texas Republican, said on . CNN's 'State of the Union.’ 'And I'd like to know what intelligence Russia has on him as well.' Sen. Charles Schumer (D-New York) was largely supportive of the FBI’s . efforts, but questioned why Tamerlan wasn’t interviewed upon his return . from Russia, where he had been for six months in 2012. ‘There . were things on his website that indicated that he had been . radicalized,’ Schumer said. ‘I think there’s a lot of questions that . have to be answered.’ Dwelling: The Tsarnaev brothers lived in this nondescript house in Cambridge, just across the river from Boston . Frequent: Tamerlan was said to often visit the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge, pictured . The . FBI interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011, shortly after Russia's Federal . Security Service asked the agency to look into him as a possible . Islamist radical who might soon travel to Russia. It was unclear before . yesterday which foreign country had tipped off the FBI. When contacted, the FBI referred . MailOnline to the statement it issued on April 19, saying the FBI’s . search into Tamerlan’s records, travel history, and internet use yielded . no results. Meanwhile, the organization has . vehemently refuting a claim by the mother of the Tsarnaev brothers who . said the bureau had spoken to Tamerlan following the two bombs exploding . at last Monday’s marathon. FBI . spokesman Michael Kortan told the Associated Press Sunday that the . interviews in 2011 with Tamerlan and family members were the agency’s . only contact with the bombing suspect. The Tsarnaev’s parents, who live . in Russia, . Less than a . year after the FBI interview, Tsarnaev did in fact travel to the . volatile Dagestan region of southern Russia on a six-month trip out of . the United States. Much of what Tsarnaev did on that trip is still a . mystery to U.S. investigators, Reuters reported. Neighbors . contacted by Reuters say Tsarnaev spent at least a few weeks in . Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim region in the North Caucasus mountains . where Islamist militants have long been a thorn in the side of . governments in Moscow. Guarded: Police guard the entrance to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Saturday, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is being treated, rooms away from 11 of the bombing victims . Critical: Tsarnaev, who was arrested Friday night, remains in critical condition under heavy guard after he was apprehended in Watertown . Republican Representative Peter King . of New York told 'Fox News Sunday' he wondered why the FBI did not take . more action after Tsarnaev returned to the United States last year and . put statements on his website 'talking about radical imams.' Tamerlan Tsarnaev was not put on any . no-fly list of suspected terrorists, U.S. officials said. But his brush . with the FBI did raise concerns when he applied for U.S. citizenship . last year, a source close to the bombing investigation said. Officials . of the Homeland Security Department decided to give his application . extra scrutiny because of the FBI interview and also due to an . allegation against him of domestic abuse on a girlfriend in 2009, the . source said. The citizenship application was still under consideration . when Monday's bombing happened. Tamerlan . Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with U.S. police. and his brother . Dzhokhar, 19, remained hospitalized in serious condition on Sunday, . unable to speak. Three people were killed in Monday's bombing and 176 . were injured. Republican . Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said 'the FBI or the system . dropped the ball' on the elder Tsarnaev. Graham told CNN that U.S. laws . do not allow the FBI to follow up enough even if it does spot danger. Democratic . Senator Charles Schumer of New York told CNN 'there's certainly a lot . of questions' about the FBI's handling of the case. One . U.S. counterterrorism official urged perspective. 'If we thoroughly . investigated every one of these terrorism tips we get, we'd never get . anything done,' he said. Captured: The FBI wanted poster released last night was updated to show that Dzhokhar was in custody . A senior U.S. law enforcement source . said that the number of tips received from Russian intelligence to the . FBI each year is 'not that many.' But . nationally, he said, the FBI receives at least 100 terrorism tips a day . - from the public, local and state law enforcement, other federal . agencies and the intelligence community. House . Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, . defended the agency. The Michigan Republican said the FBI had performed a . 'very thorough' review of the older brother in 2011, but then it failed . to receive further cooperation from Russia. 'That case was closed prior to his travel, so I don't think we missed anything,' Rogers said on NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 'At . some point they (the FBI) asked, is there more clarifying information, . and never received that clarifying information, and at some point they . have nothing. You can't ask them to do something with nothing,' Rogers . said. But McCaul and King said the handling of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's case looked like it was part of a pattern. Open investigation: Law enforcement evidence technicians continue to investigate the scene of the Boston Marathon bombings on Saturday . The . 26-year-old 'appears to be the fifth person since September 11, 2001, . to participate in terror attacks despite being under investigation by . the FBI,' the pair said in a joint letter. They . named the others as Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric and leader of . al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen who was killed in a U.S. drone strike; . David Headley, an American who admitted scouting targets for a 2008 . Islamic militant raid on Mumbai; Carlos Bledsoe, who killed an Army . private outside a military recruiting office in Arkansas in 2009; and .

"Military researchers have put dozens of soldiers, both women and men, through a series of drills Wednesday aimed at helping the Army develop a unisex test to decide which troops are fit for combat. Fort Stewart spent weeks training volunteers in performing tasks the Army considers essential for troops on front lines- from dragging a wounded comrade to safety to loading 65 pound anti-tank missiles. Scientists from the Army's Research Institute for Environmental Medicine had volunteer soldiers don oxygen masks and heart-rate monitors to record their exertion. Scroll down for video . Changing the tests: Commanders want front line tests to more accurately mimics the most strenuous tasks that infantrymen, tank crews and other combat troops perform (soldiers in Fort Drum pictured doing a physical fitness test) Old tricks: Commanders want to break from longtime gauges of physical fitness that include push-ups, sit-ups and 2-mile runs (a soldier is pictured doing push ups while serving in Balad, Iraq) On Tuesday the troops- 89 men and 58 women-  were timed as they toted heavy cans of ammunition and scrambled with rifles through an obstacle course laid out with orange cones. The Pentagon plans to start opening up combat jobs to women as early as 2016. Commanders want to break from longtime gauges of physical fitness that include push-ups, sit-ups and 2-mile runs in order to devise a test that more accurately mimics the most strenuous tasks that infantrymen, tank crews and other combat troops perform. Drills such as scaling a 6-foot wall in 70 pounds of gear and removing the heavy barrel of a 25 mm gun on an armored vehicles are nothing new for male soldiers already in combat units. That said, they're completely unfamiliar to Army women so Fort Stewart gave its soldier-volunteers a month to train. 'When we started, it was very challenging because we'd never experienced any of these tasks before,' said Captain Nartrish Lance, 40, who after 21 years in the Army is getting her first taste of what it takes to serve in a combat unit. 'But, once you get to rehearse ... it becomes easy.' Co-ed: Drills such as scaling a 6-foot wall in 70 pounds of gear and removing the heavy barrel of a 25 mm gun on an armored vehicles are nothing new for male soldiers but they are new to female soldiers . On Tuesday the troops- 89 men and 58 women-  were timed during the run through at Fort Stewart in Georgia . In seeking fitness standards based on real-word job requirements, the Army follows many U.S. fire departments that in recent years made entrance tests fairer to women than old standards heavy on push-ups and other upper-body exercises that favor men. Major General Mike Murray, commander of Fort Stewart's 3rd Infantry Division, said allowing women into combat units will do more than break one of the military's last gender barriers. He noted a very small Army 'population' will qualify, adding 'this overall effort is really about matching skill sets and attributes to the right job.' Whatever fitness test emerges for combat service should be a challenge for both men and women to show that standards aren't being lowered to accommodate female soldiers, said Lory Manning, a retired Navy captain who studies how military policies affect women for the Women's Research and Education Institute. 'The idea for the military isn't that any women coming through can pass their test,' Manning said. 'It's that anybody male or female who can pass the test should be able to serve in that occupation. If it's one woman out of a thousand, so be it.'","Male and female soldiers in Fort Stewart, Georgia have been tested on a new set of drills as women are considered for front-line positions .

"The Copa Libertadores provided one of the most eventful matches in recent memory when Montevideo Wanderers welcomed Venezuelan side Zamora to Uruguay. Five goals, five red cards and a wonder strike followed by an impressive bowling-ball strike celebration. Montevideo came out 3-2 winners after scoring two late goals but the game is likely to be remembered for Arles Flores' strike and funny celebration for Zamora. VIDEO: Scroll down for the wonder goal and superb celebration . Arles Flores (centre) rifles home a 35-yard strike for Zamora to put them 2-1 up against Montevideo . Wanderers goalkeeper Leandro Burian is helpless as the ball flies past him and into the back of the net . The 35-yard strike is one that Flores is unlikely to forget and his celebration matched the finish . Flores and his teammates then took part in the 'bowling ball strike' celebration after his wonder goal . The midfielder took aim when the scores were poised at 1-1 and blasted home from 35 yards past the helpless keeper. Zamora had gone down to 10 men after just 20 minutes when Angel Faria received a straight red before Jhon Murillo gave them the lead with a fine individual effort. Wanderers leveled things up just 16 minutes later but not by scoring - they had Adrian Colombino sent off to make it 10 men apiece. The midfielder looks elated as he completes the funny celebration after giving his side a 2-1 lead . They did however equalise in stoppage time in the first half when Gaston Rodriguez fired home from inside the box. Flores then produced the moment of the match after half-time when he picked up the ball deep in the opposition half, burst forward and arrowed a strike straight into the top corner. His celebration wasn't bad either as him and his team-mates performed the 'bowling-ball strike' to celebrate his goal. The Venezuelan side then came within inches of extending their advantage when Murillo chipped the goalkeeper - only for it to rebound back off the bar. That miss came back to haunt them as Montevideo made it 2-2 from the penalty spot through Nicolas Albarracín. The offender Luis Ovalle also received his marching orders for hauling down Albarracín and being shown his second yellow. The Uruguayans then took the lead for the first time on 82 minutes when substitute Leandro Reymundez flicked in a neat header. Murillo and Montevideo's Juan Mascia were then sent off three minutes into injury-time to make it 9-8 in terms of players left on the pitch and bring this mental game to an explosive end.

"An explosive new report claims New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez courted a married newspaper publisher and  took her on an exclusive beach vacation to the home of his friend, the then-governor of Puerto Rico. The New York Post reports that photos provided to the newspaper show Menendez, 59, and Cecilia Reynolds enjoying a getaway on the island. One picture shows Ms Reynolds, 50, sitting naked on a beach and smiling at the camera 'suggestively,' according to the Post. Explosive: A new report claims Senator Bob Menendez, right, courted married businesswoman Cecilia Reynolds with a trip to Puerto Rico . Businesswoman: Ms Reynolds, who runs a Spanish-language newspaper, is seen here during an official meeting at Menendez's office . Other pictures show the pair posing, Menendez's arm wrapped around Ms Reynold's waist, at a waterfall at a Puerto Rican national park. An anonymous source is said to have handed over the information to the Post, as well as the National Legal and Policy Center, a Virginia-based conservative watchdog group. The source said the trip took place in 2007 when Ms Reynolds, a mother of two, was married to her husband Matt Reynolds. Ms Reynolds, who is still with Mr Reynolds, said in a statement that she and her husband were separated 'for a period of time in the past.' However, she add: 'Any and all allegations being peddled by a former disgruntled business partner are false and malicious.' Married: Ms Reynolds was married at the time of the trip, though she says she had been separated from her husband Matt Reynolds for 'a period of time.' The 50-year-old businesswoman has two children . The powerful Democratic senator released a statement on Friday saying: 'These are the same kind of questionably timed smear tactics that we’ve seen before, and we’re not going to dignify them with a comment.' Menendez divorced his schoolteacher wife, the mother of his two children, in 2005. Close ties: The couple reportedly stayed at the home of Former Puerto Rico governor Anibal Acevedo Vila . Ms Reynolds is the owner of the Spanish language newspaper Nostros, which circulates in three New Jersey counties. The Post reports that the allegations of an affair reveal that he maintained a close relationship to the governor of Puerto Rico at the time, Anibal Acevedo Vila. At the time, Acevedo Vila was under investigation by the U.S. Attorney for Puerto Rico and was later charged with 19 counts related to campaign finance fraud. Acevdeo Vila lost a re-election campaign . in 2008. A judge later dismissed 15 of the charges against him. A jury . acquitted him of the remaining four charges. The Post reports that Menendez and Reynolds stayed at Acevedo Vila's secluded beachfront home during their getaway. At the same time, Menendez was reportedly working to block the appointment of Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, the interim U.S. Attorney who was investigating Acevdeo Vila, according to the Newark Star-Ledger. 'Menendez apparently sees no ethics problem with taking his married girlfriend to the Puerto Rico governor’s beach house while the governor was under federal investigation, and published reports describe Menendez as putting a senatorial hold on the nomination of the US attorney who was to oversee the investigation,' Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, told the Post. 'Is there any wonder the public has such a low opinion of elected officials?' Menendez, a leader in the Senate immigration fight, is being investigated by a federal grand jury over his relationship with a Florida ophthalmologist, a wealthy donor. He is accused of using his power to help steer contractors toward Dr Salomon Melgen's business interests, the Washington Post reports.","New York Post reports an anonymous source handed over photos of the 2007 trip Sen Menendez took newspaper publisher Cecilia Reynolds on .

"Carl Froch has been ordered to fight Andre Ward for a second time within the next four months.

Froch was defeated on points by Ward when the pair first met in December, 2011 . Froch recently relinquished his IBF belt to allow domestic rival James DeGale to fight for the vacant belt. And the 37-year-old has shown little interest in a rematch with Ward. Indeed, Froch was due to fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas next month but had to withdraw through injury. Meanwhile, Bernard Hopkins has hit back at Froch after the Nottingham fighter suggested a title bout against the 50-year-old American would be a 'lose-lose situation'.

AC Milan were next to be denied by the impressive penalty juggernaut that was Liverpool - who at this point had only lost one shootout in their entire history - as the English produced one of the most memorable and dramatic comebacks of all-time to lift the coveted trophy.

'A . scan showed she had six tumours in her liver, one being 7cm wide and . she didn't have those in December. It was such a shock, we didn't . realise she had it that badly.' She . died on Sunday surrounded by her family, who said she was pleased to . have met her nine-week-old nephew, Freddie, before she passed away. 'In her last few days she was unable to . catch up on the sleep she desperately needed. The illness had taken its . toll and sadly she passed away later that afternoon at home,' her mother added. One of Miss Noble's final messages on Twitter included the Winston . Churchill quote: ‘Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage . to continue that counts.' Polly was treated for cervical cancer in 2005 and revealed the diagnosis to her best friend Katherine Jenkins over the phone while she was on tour. The . pair had become close after meeting as struggling singers in 2001 and . Katherine always maintained Polly was . the ‘true star’, not her. After initial treatment of her cancer in 2005, she discovered a lump on her neck in 2010 and, despite undergoing radiotherapy to treat that, she then discovered she had cancerous cells in her lungs. Friends: Miss Noble and Katherine together last year. Katherine said of her friend: 'Polly has never had a ""poor me"" mentality.

Speaking to You Magazine last year, Katherine said: ‘She didn’t look or sound ill – it was just unbelievable. 'And of course the word cancer frightens the life out of me because I had watched my father die of lung cancer when I was 15'. She added: ‘But he had been nearly 70, and Polly was just 24. She was too young; she had too much to live for.’ Jenkins' former boyfriend Gethin Jones tweeted: 'Reading beautiful messages . about the inspirational @Pollynoble. She touched so many. Grateful to . have spent some wonderful times with her'. But . the cancer diagnosis meant her 'life turned upside down' and after . surviving several long stays in hospital, where three litres of water . were drained from her chest, and she suffered a major blood clot, she . wanted to 'cure herself' of cancer. She . wrote on her blog: 'Throughout all of it, I have been able to maintain a . positive outlook, belief and faith that I will overcome cancer, once . and for all. In fact, I do it everyday as an active participant in my . healing journey. Girls day out: Polly and Katherine, who met before the singer became famous, at a polo match in 2010 .

'This . means that I live consciously in all areas of my life, creating a . balanced and healthy existence, which allows me to move forward and live . my dream life, despite living with cancer. 'When . I got ill, I wished I had taken better care of myself. I wished I had . known more about the things in everyday life that were harming me'. Katherine Jenkins was there to support her friend as she went through surgery before having chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Initally, the treatment worked and Polly was able to move back to London where she lived cancer free for three years. However, in 2010, she found a lump in her neck that turned out to be a secondary tumour. Katherine . recalled the moment she found out as she said: ‘This time her . oncologist told her that although she could have more treatment, the . cancer was ultimately incurable. ‘She called me from the hospital with the news. Neither of us cried. We were too stunned.’ Miss Noble . co-authored a book, The Cancer Journey, which was published in 2011, . giving advice for others on how to cope with the disease. Determined . to live life to the full, she also posted a touching video on . YouTube in 2012 of all the things she had done that year. Speaking last year, Miss Noble said: 'I lost my long dark hair as a result of my treatment, and normally, when I go out or have my picture taken, I reach for one of my wigs.

Katherine was inspired by her best friend’s strength as she said: ‘Polly has turned her own experiences into an incredibly positive force. 'The book she has co-written on coping with cancer is just what I wish I had been able to turn to when my father became ill. 'She has also trained as a holistic health coach, become a nutrition guru and developed her own website on healthy living.’ Katherine shared another picture of the pair on Instagram with the caption: 'Heartbroken - Sleep now with the angels'. *Polly backed the YES TO LIFE charity, which supports people with the disease by combining both alternative medicine and standard treatments. Inspirational: After being diagnosed with the disease, Miss Noble dedicated her life to helping others in a similar situation . For you dad: Katherine Jenkins ran the 2013 Virgin London Marathon in honour of her father, who also passed away following his battle with cancer . Cervical cancer is a rare form of cancer that develops at the entrance to the womb. It is most common in sexually active women aged between 25 and 45 but because of routine screening in the UK it is usually picked up in the pre-cancerous stage. It often has no symptoms in the early stages but the most common symptom is unusual bleeding, especially after sex or between periods. It is recommended that all women between the ages of 25 and 49 are screened for cervical cancer every three years. The NHS scrapped routine smears for under-25s in 2003 over concerns they could do more harm than good. But the family of aspiring model Sophie Jones (right), who died of the disease after after being refused a smear test - say they should be given to all young women who have symptoms, regardless of age. Sophie, 19, was told she was too young to have a smear test when she  complained of crippling stomach pains last February. Her family's campaign – Sophie’s Choice – is backed by MPs and 225,000 signatures and calls for the minimum age for automatic tests to be cut to 16. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'The issue was last debated in Parliament in 2009, but the best independent evidence still shows that routine screening of women under 25 does more harm than good. ‘Cervical cancer in women under 25s is extremely rare. In 2011, there were 47 cases of cervical cancer in women under 25 and no deaths.' Of all of the women with cervical cancer, about 83 per cent live for at least a year after diagnosis, 67 per cent live for at least five years and 63 per cent live for at least 10 years.","Lifestyle coach Polly Noble, 32, died after a long battle with cervical cancer .

"Glenn Whelan has slammed his Stoke City teammates and labelled their display at Blackburn as 'the worst performance' following their embarrassing exit. Mark Hughes' side took the lead at Ewood Park but were outplayed and outfought as the Lancashire club came away with a 4-1 win. The Irish international didn't hold back and heavily criticised the performance. Glenn Whelan (centre) has slammed his teammates and labelled their FA Cup exit to Blackburn as 'the worst' Speaking to the Stoke Sentinel he said: 'It was terrible. It was the worst performance I've ever seen a Stoke City side put out; we didn't want to fight or do the basics. 'Fair play to Blackburn, they came out and properly dug us out. 'We weren't prepared to work hard enough. It's ok when things are going well, we've got good players then but when you want to fight and you want to knuckle down maybe we haven't got enough in the dressing room. The Irish midfielder and his teammates look on after conceding their fourth goal at Ewood Park . 'Hopefully the manager has seen that today and will show it next week because it's just not good enough; as a team, as an 11. Players didn't really want to be out there and you could see that after the first 10 minutes. Credit to Blackburn they deserved to go through.' Stoke were hampered by a number of injuries in the build up to the game and had Geoff Cameron sent off in the first half but Whelan feels they have no excuse. 'Injuries are an easy excuse. We've still got 11 players to go out and give Blackburn a game. Joshua King (7) scored an impressive hat trick to compel Stoke to an embarrassing 4-1 defeat . 'We were 1-0 up but we gave away sloppy goals and it was really disappointing today because we thought we could go on and do something. 'We've sat down and had words between ourselves but that will stay within the dressing room. It's not nice coming away from a 4-1 defeat to Manchester City in mid-week but you think ok, it's the champions. Not against Blackburn, no disrespect. They fully deserved to win and I don't think they had to work very hard to get it. 'What the manager has said will stay in the dressing room. Things have been got off chests. It doesn't matter how good a player you are if you are not prepared to put the work in; the hard yards and the graft. If you don't do that then you don't deserve to be wearing the jersey. Peter Crouch (left) gives Mark Hughes' side the lead in the FA Cup tie but it was all downhill after that . 'Hopefully in the next week some lads will have to reflect on that.' Despite the setback, Whelan wants his side to move on from this disappointment and concentrate on the rest of the season. 'It's hard work from Monday, going out and getting our season going again. We were thinking we had a good chance of going a long way in this competition. 'It wasn't to be but we have to keep our season going, get our standards up and make sure the season does not slip us by because we can still achieve something this year.'

"The new tax will add just over 1p to a can of fizzy drink such as Coca-Cola . France is to impose a 'fat tax' on sugary soft drinks in a bid to combat soaring child obesity. The new tax will add just over 1p to a can of fizzy drink like Coca-Cola or Fanta but zero-calorie 'diet' drinks will be exempt from the charges, the government said. The new measures - a hike of from 3 to 6 Euro cents per litre on sugary drinks - are also expected to raise more than £100 million a year for government coffers. The revenue would be used to fund lower social security charges for farm workers, the government said. The move comes days after France also announced it would be rationing tomato ketchup and salt in school canteens. Under the rules, tomato sauce and mayonnaise will only be on dinner tables once a week when chips are served and would be removed when traditional French dishes such as roast veal are served. Denmark also recently announced a new higher tax on foods containing high levels of saturated fat. French MP Gilles Carrez said of his country's latest soft drinks tax: 'This project will have both health benefits as children turn away from sugary drinks, and revenue benefits for our core agricultural workforce.' A recent study found a fast-food diet of junk food is turning the traditionally skinny French into a nation of fatties. More than 20 million French people are now overweight and seven million of those are clinically obese - double the figure for 14 years ago, according to France's National Institute for Health and Medical Research. Despite still being officially Europe's second thinnest people, the weight of the average French person has soared by half a stone to 11 stone 4lbs since 1997, the report found. Obesity: Government's are now tackling excessive weight gain in their populations and are targeting sugary drinks. France is bringing in measures to ration mayonnaise and tomato ketchup in schools . A French health ministry spokesman added: 'We French may be among the least overweight in Europe but we have nothing to be complacent about. 'Obesity is rising as swiftly in France as it is in other EU countries and action must be taken before it gets any more serious.' Europe's fattest nation is Greece, where 70 per cent of people are overweight, and 30 per cent are obese. Britons are Europe's fifth fattest, behind Germany, Finland and Ireland, according to a TNS Sofres survey of 500,000 people across the EU. The NHS defines being overweight as having a body mass index - your weight to height ratio - of between 25 and 30, and obese as over 30.","New laws come days after announcement that tomato ketchup and mayonnaise will be rationed in schools .

Liverpool's players were kept awake by honking of car horns from the Besiktas fans on Wednesday night . The police were called to the Wyndham Hotel in Istanbul, and they were able to put a stop the racket created by Turkish side's fans. Banners such as 'Welcome to Hell' and 'Liverpool You'll Walk Alone Here' were displayed just before kick-off as Slaven Bilic's side attempted to overcome the 1-0 deficit. Their disruption techniques may well have worked as Liverpool lost on penalties, with Dejan Lovren missing the decisive spot-kick in a shootout that Besiktas won 5-4.

"A Chinese tourist has offended monks at a Buddhist temple by trying to donate his iPhone 6 instead of a fistful of loose change. Cong Chu made the faux pas when he approached a collection box at the temple in the city of Foshan in southern China’s Guangdong province. Tourists normally make an offering of cash, but the 31-year-old decided to drop his almost new smartphone into the box and walk away. Cong Chu offended monks at a Buddhist temple in China when he tried to donate his iPhone 6 . Monks pulled the iPhone out of the box and handed it back to the embarrassed tourist, who was visiting the sacred site with his girlfriend and friends. They informed him that they only accept monetary donations, which are used to fund maintenance projects, and they don’t possess smartphones or know how to use them. Chinese media contacted Cong after the snap of his offering went viral, and he told them that he did not intend to insult the monks or visitors to the temple north-west of Hong Kong. He said: ‘I was told that if you go there you can get prosperity and good fortune for the coming year and as it was a holiday anyway and my girlfriend was going, I decided to tag along. Tourists normally make an offering of cash, but this visitor decided to drop his smartphone into the box . ‘I didn't realise that we were expected to make an offering of something valuable and only had a few small denomination notes on me. ‘I didn't want to offend anyone, or embarrass my girlfriend, so I decided to donate my iPhone which was worth a good few hundred pounds as it was brand-new.’ A new iPhone 6 retails for about 6,000 yuan in China (approximately £630 or $970). Cong Chu, 31, said he didn't intend to offend the monks or cause embarrassment for his girlfriend . After another visitor snapped a picture of him making the unorthodox donation, he was spotted by a monk, who hurried over, opened the collection box and returned the mobile phone. Temple spokesman Hui Ho said: ""We informed him that we only accept cash donations which are used for the maintenance of the temple and the everyday expenses of the monks. ‘In any case, they don't have smartphones or know how to use them.’ The temple relies on donations from visitors to fund maintenance projects and 'everyday expenses' After taking the phone back, the man had handed over all of the notes he had on him and apologised to the monks. Cong was criticised after the image went viral on Chinese social media networks, with people saying his offering was disrespectful, and they accused him of treating religion as a joke. One wrote: ‘How can anyone be so ignorant, and offer something that represents exactly what monks are campaigning against as they urge people to be more in touch with their spiritual side.’","Cong Chu, 31, dropped his almost new iPhone 6 into a collection box .

"A man charged with kidnapping, robbing and sexually assaulting a woman has claimed it couldn't have been rape... because he is so handsome. Darrious Mathis had managed to persuade a member of a jury in Marietta, Georgia, that his alleged victim must have consented to sex with him on account of his good looks. His claim resulted in an 11-1 hung jury after nearly four days of deliberation back in September, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial. Really, really good looking: Darrious Mathis even managed to persuade a member of a jury that his victim could only have consented to sex with him on account of his good looks . Mistrial: Incredibly, his claim resulted in an 11-1 hung jury after nearly four days of deliberation, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial . But prosecutors successfully applied for a retrial which began this week, and yesterday the woman shared her story with another jury for a second time, Kirotv.com reported. The alleged offence is said to have taken . place in the early hours of October 25 2011 when Mathis approached the . unnamed 24-year-old woman as she was leaving a CVS pharmacy and pulled . out a gun. He then forced her to drive to various ATM cash machines and withdraw money before sexually assaulting her, the court heard. 'He had told me to get in the car and I . actually begged him to take my car,' she told the court. 'I had pushed . my wallet that was in my hand and my keys toward him and I was like . ‘Please take my car. You can take my cards and everything.' Accused: The offence is alleged to have taken place two years ago when Mathis approached the unnamed 24-year-old woman as she was leaving a CVS pharmacy and pulled out a gun . He then forced her to drive from the Austell CVS, into Atlanta, where he sexually assaulted her, the court heard. 'In my mind I figured that was the best way, instead of panicking and trying to get hurt,' the woman said. His lawyer, however, claims she consented to the sex, mostly because of his good looks and the fact that she gave him her phone number. The woman said she gave him the phone number because she was terrified. His defence counsel offered an alternative explanation, however, claiming she was attracted to his bubbly personality and handsome features coupled with the fact she wanted to buy drugs from him. 'He walked up to her with a bottle of Vicodin and said, ""Wanna buy some pills?"" She said, ""Sure, get in. We’ll go to the ATM,""' said attorney Carter Clayton. Mathis is facing kidnapping, carjacking, assault and weapons charges.","Darrious Mathis is alleged to have attacked the woman in 2011 .

"These stunning photographs reflecting a perfectly still landscape are like an image captured in a dream. The amazing colours in the sky are mirrored in the still water covering the landscape for miles and miles. Photographer and lawyer Michael Kittell captured these colourful images when he visited the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia with his wife, Taylor. Photographer and lawyer Michael Kittell captured these colourful images when he and his wife visited the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia . And he believes that at 10,500 square kilometres, the world's largest salt plain is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Here, at 12,000ft, a couple of centimetres of water covers the plain but sits perfectly still in the remote plain because there is no wind. And the stillness of the atmosphere allows the stunning skies to be mirrored perfectly in the water. Michael, 29, from Tillamook in Oregon, USA, said: 'Although it may look like a beach, they are rather an expansive salt flat covered in about a couple centimetres of water for as far as the eye can see. Walking to heaven: This tranquil images captures reflections of the beautiful red Bolivian sky in an area of the country which is off the beaten track . Taylor Kittell practices yoga on the Bolivian salt flats in this image captured by her husband Michael . Paradise: The reflections of the clouds and people in these images give them an 'other-worldly' feel. The silhouettes appear to be hovering in the air . This image could be mistaken for an Arctic snow scene, but it was actually taken on salt flats in Bolivia . 'The altiplano is an extremely arid area, but rain and snow-melt often result in shallow water covering the Salar de Uyuni salt flat for a short time each year. 'When the wind is calm and the Salar is filled with water, the result is one of the most otherworldly dreamscape imaginable. 'I was lucky enough to have fantastic cloud formations as well. The sky appears to set alight in this reflective image of a sunset over salt flats in Bolivia . This dreamlike image appears to show an island, but the stillness of the atmosphere creates a a beautiful reflection of the cloudy sky . 'The Salar de Uyuni is a very special place. These photos remind me that unimaginably beautiful places exist in this world and I get this feeling of awe.' According to Michael, the Salar de Uyuni is 'out-of-the-way' for almost everyone. It is most often reached by travellers who take an overnight bus from La Paz in Bolivia along remote and often bumpy dirt roads. In a couple of the photos, his wife can be seen practicing yoga, while in others people are simply admiring the scenery. Michael said: 'I think the landscape depicted in these photographs is so clear because the Altiplano is far from any cities. 'With an elevation of 12,000 ft, the air is thin and unadulterated by pollution. 'The Salar de Uyuni is a rather popular attraction for people visiting Bolivia but its remote location makes any visit an inconvenient and time-consuming endeavor. Photographer Mr Kittell said: 'These photos remind me that unimaginably beautiful places exist in this world and I get this feeling of awe.' 'The staging town for the Bolivian Altiplano is Uyuni, a small and unattractive community full of tour operators peddling the exact same tour. 'The town of Uyuni is a couple hours from the salt flats and the only accommodation on the salt flats is a small and basic ""salt hotel"". 'The hotel is amazing because it is literally made of salt, including all the furniture. 'Almost all tours visit this salt hotel at the exact same time for only a couple hours each day and then leave well before sunset. 'The fortunate few who stay at the salt hotel have the entire Salar and its sunset and sunrise to themselves. 'However, staying at the salt hotel is not easy - it took my group a great deal of research and perseverance to convince a tour operator to customise a tour so that we could stay there. 'Our time on the Salar de Uyuni was absolutely a highlight of our time in Bolivia. 'Having said that, I was definitely done with salt after just one night - it gets in your every pore and saturates into your shoes and clothes.'

"Manny Pacquiao has offered to pay Floyd Mayweather Jnr $5million (£3.2m) if he fails a drug test in the build up to their proposed £200m mega-fight. Pacquiao, who also revealed the fight is close to being announced, has agreed to Mayweather's strict, Olympic-style testing. Mayweather is expected to announce that he will face the Filipino star in Las Vegas on May 2. Floyd Mayweather was at the NBA All-Star weekend as the world waits for him to announce his fight . Mayweather is set to face his long-time rival Pacquiao on May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas . '(The fight) is near. The negotiations are nearly finished,' Pacquiao told reporters on Monday during a break from parliament in his homeland. 'We agreed that this fight has to happen. We are ironing out the kinks. He (Mayweather) said he wants the fight to push through. 'We agreed to their [drug-testing] demand. In fact, I suggested a $5m fine if I test positive for drugs.' The same sanction would apply if Mayweather failed a test. Until now, the closest Mayweather and Pacquiao came to clambering through the ropes of the same ring was in 2010 when contracts were drawn up. But Pacquiao refused to commit to a drug-testing regime overseen by the United States Anti-Doping Association (USADA) which would involve taking blood and urine samples at random right up until the day of the fight. Mayweather last fought when he beat Marcos Maidana in their rematch last September . Mayweather and Pacquiao have been negotiating since they came face-to-face on a basketball court . He was prepared to provide urine samples at any time but wanted three set days to give blood; one in January, one no more than 30 days before the fight, and one immediately after the fight. Pacquiao was concerned that a blood test so close to the contest would weaken him, having blamed his 2005 defeat by Erik Morales on having to give blood two days beforehand. The chances of two of the best boxers in the world finally touching gloves were enhanced last month when they came face-to-face at a basketball match in Miami. Mayweather later spent more than an hour in Pacquiao's hotel suite in a bid to thrash out the finer details although no official announcement has been forthcoming. Mayweather said on Sunday that neither fighter had signed a contract but that he was 'hopeful' the fight would happen. Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November .","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are close to agreeing their fight .

"The best photography is that which lets you see past what is being photographed to something else; something beyond the obvious, a feeling, a thought or a way of life so vivid you feel a part of it. If there was one photographer who became a master at this it was Edward Curtis,  born in 1868, who began taking photographs in 1890 and dedicated much of his career to recording traditional American Indian customs. Curtis is known for expertly documenting the last of America's tribes from 1906 to 1930 in a mammoth collection  called The North American Indian. Such was his expertise that powerful bankers J.P Morgan personally financed his work. Edward Curtis spent many years profiling tribesmen and women and their way of life in images such as this one of a Cheyenne male from 1908 . 'Bringing the Sweat lodge Willows', 1900, shows Piegan men on horseback triumphantly riding towards an encampment brandishing willows . Curtis produced over 40,000 negatives, 10,000 wax cylinder recordings of language and over 4,000 pages of anthropological text . During these years of work Curtis encountered almost every hardship imaginable to produce over 40,000 negatives, 10,000 wax cylinder recordings of language and music, over 4,000 pages of highly regarded anthropological text and a feature length film. From  1905 to 1909 Curtis documented  Cheyenne Indians. The Cheyenne tribe historically lived on the Great Plains on what is now known as South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas. One arresting image of a Cheyenne man entitled 'Cheyenne Type' from 1908 appears in soft focus with his hair braided  staring into the lens. Another - 'Cheyenne Girl' - is  a similarly close up and starkly intense portrait taken three years before, in 1905. One of his most famous images: 'An Oasis in the Bad Lands' taken in 1905 shows Red Hawk, a notorious warrior, letting his horse drink . Curtis is known for expertly documenting the last of America's tribes from 1906 to 1930 in a epic collection called The North American Indian . Curtis's most famous images is the sort-after 'An Oasis in the Bad Lands' from 1905. In it, a character called Red Hawk sits on horseback while his horse drinks from a small pool of water. Red Hawk was  born in 1854 and a notorious warrior who fought in 20 battles, including the Custer fight in 1876. Water is a consistent feature in Curtis's work as he was drawn to its pictorial and metaphorical influence on a composition. Another striking  photograph shows a Piegan man kneeling and holding a decorative medicine pipe in 1910. The Cheyenne tribe historically lived on the Great Plains on what is now known as South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas. This image taken by Curtis in 1905 shows Little Wolf, a Cheyenne male, wearing plaits and feathers in his hair . A self photo of Edward  Curtis, thought to have been taken in 1899. The acclaimed cameraman built his first camera aged 12 after saving $1.25 and  using a copy of Wilson's Photographics - a popular manual at the time - as a point of reference. He started photographing local native Indians digging for clams and mussels during low tides and won plaudits at the National Photographic Convention in 1898 and 1899 . In the accompanying caption, Curtis wrote: 'Medicine-pipes, of which the Piegan have many, are simply long pipe-stems variously decorated with beads, paint, feathers, and fur. Each one is believed to have been obtained long ago in some supernatural manner, as recounted in a myth. 'The medicine-pipe is ordinarily concealed in a bundle of wrappings, which are removed only when the sacred object is to be employed in healing sickness, or when it is to be transferred from one custodian to another in exchange for property.' 'On a Sia housetop' taken in 1925 shows a indigenous woman sitting on the top of a house holding a patterned bowl in full jewellery . He didn't shy away from action shots either, as 'Bringing the Sweat lodge Willows - Piegan'  shows. The shot depicts a group of young horsemen  riding triumphantly towards an encampment  with willows 'for the faster's sweat-lodge'. A picture of a man taken in 1923 show him wearing a tall headdress. Curtis captioned the image with some information: 'The head-dress is of the type common to the Klamath River tribes - a broad band of deerskin partially covered with a row of red scalps of woodpecker. 'The massive necklace of clam-shell beads indicates the wealth of the wearer, or of the friend from whom he borrowed it. He carries a ceremonial celt of black obsidian and a decorated bow.' A Piegan man kneels holding medicine pipe described by Curtis as 'long pipe-stems variously decorated with beads, paint, feathers, and fur' Water is a consistent feature in Curtis's work as he was drawn to its pictorial and metaphorical influence on a composition . Curtis was christened Edward Sheriff Curtis and born into abject poverty in Wisconsin in 1868 to parents Ellen and Johnson Curtis. After a few years the family moved to Cordova, a rural settlement in Le Sueur County, Minnesota, where Johnson Curtis worked as a preacher. Canoe trips to visit members of the congregation with his father gave Edward his first experiences of the great outdoors as a boy and their camping trips helped prepare him for research and life in the field. Edward took canoe trips and went camping with his father  as a young boy which helped inform and prepare him for his work in the field . There were many different Native American canoe styles, and tribes could often easily recognize each other just by the profile of their canoes . The 'Indian was the remnant of a savage past away from which civilized men had struggled to grow,' wrote Roy Harvey Pearce in a book called Savagism and Civilization . Aged 12 he saved $1.25 and built a camera using a copy of Wilson's Photographics, a popular manual at the time. Reports say he apprenticed in a photo studio in Saint Paul from 1885 to 1886 before his family moved to the Puget Sound region of Washington State. Throughout the 1890s, during his twenties,  Curtis's interest in photography sharpened. He started photographing local native Indians digging for clams and mussels during low tides and won  plaudits  at the National Photographic Convention in 1898 and 1899 for a series of three sepia, softly focused images of Native Americas entitled Evening on the Sound, The Clam Digger and The Mussel Gatherer. Images of the Nunivak tribeswomen wearing beaded hats: Curtis visited Alaska for scientific research and to photograph its people . Edward Curtis once wrote of himself: 'While primarily a photographer, I do not see or think photographically' The great photographer apprenticed in a photo studio in St Paul from 1885 to 1886 before his family moved to the Puget Sound region . It was then that his interest in Native peoples took off and Curtis immersed himself in the science behind beautiful portraits and scenic shots. He once wrote of himself: 'While primarily a photographer, I do not see or think photographically; hence the story of Indian life will not be told in microscopic detail, but rather will be presented as a broad and luminous picture.' Tolowa Dancing Head Dress, 1923: Klamath River tribesmen often wore headdresses and the necklace of clam shell beads denotes wealth . Cheyenne Girl 1905: An intense portrait of a girl from the Cheyenne tribe wearing earrings and a matching necklace . Curtis's photos show the Native Indians as historical features of an American landscape, supporting the view that they were viewed as a 'vanishing race' by many in the early 20th Century . Curtis's photos  evolved to the status of ethnographic representations which were studied for critical analysis . A traditional longhouse photographed  by Curtis, who died in 1952 in Los Angeles . Curtis released a movie, In the Land of the Head-Hunters, in 1914 depicting the 'primal life' of Northwest Coast Indians . Thousands of photographs lay forgotten in the basement of the Charles Lauriat Company, a rare book dealer in Boston, until their rediscovery in the 1970s, which marked the revival of interest in Curtis' haunting images of American Indians . Riverside settlement: Curtis was eager to record every aspect of the lives of the Native American Indians . Curtis opened his photographic studio in the early 1890s - the same time that many natives lost their land and their human rights . Fishing for the family: A young Indian is captured by Curtis perched atop a wooden structure built into the rocky outcrop on this river . From the 1890s the Native Indians were pictured as the tragic cultures of a vanishing race . Attempts to forcefully eradicate Indian culture and assimilate Indians into American society cemented the myth of the 'vanishing race' All the clothes were made by hand, and decorated with designs, beadwork, and other art, so no two people in the tribe had the same dress . Some longhouses could be up up to 200 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 20 feet high, sleeping up to around 60 in an entire clan . Deer, buffalo, fish, and various birds were the game of choice, with corn, beans, squash, berries, nuts, and melons also consumed . The North American Indian project produced by Curtis is described as one of the most significant and controversial representations of traditional American Indian culture ever produced .","Edward Curtis dedicated much of his life to profiling and documenting Native American tribes in beautiful portraits .

"EU prepares to seize assets of individuals and firms linked to Assad's regime . At least 10,224 people, including over 5,000 children have crossed the border to Turkey . Hundreds more Syrian civilians were forced to flee into Turkey after government troops mounted a crackdown close to the border today. Soldiers moved closer in to the border zone and took down a Turkish flag that had been raised at a look-out post on the Syrian side of the border. Nearly 100 Syrians, who were living in makeshift tents, fled into Turkey as soldiers closed in around the border village of Khirbet al-Jouz. Tension: Refugees enter Turkey as Syrian government soldiers watch on from an armoured vehicle . Turkish authorities have responded by placing armed guards along their side of the border. Thousands of refugees have been flooding into Turkey as the Syrian government tries to crush the three-month-old uprising. The regime blames foreign conspirators and thugs for the unrest. Local sources reported that tanks had entered the border village of Khirbet al-Jouz and snipers were spotted on rooftops looking out over the nearby refugee camp. Syria has banned foreign journalists and restricted local media, making it nearly impossible to independently confirm the accounts. The European Union is . planning to hit the Syrian regime with more sanctions, targeting the . assets of seven more individuals and four companies with connections to President Bashar al-Assad.

The opposition estimates 1,400 people have been killed and 10,000 detained in the Syrian crackdown, drawing international condemnation and sanctions. According to the Turkish ministry of disaster and emergency management, at least 10,224 people, including over 5,000 children have crossed the border from Syria to Turkey. On Wednesday, the Syrian regime lashed out at European governments for threatening a new round of sanctions and accused the West of trying to sow chaos and conflict in the Arab nation.

"The skeleton of Simon Allen was  found in the lounge of his city centre Brighton flat . A loner lay dead in his city centre flat for two years after no one realised he had passed away, an inquest heard. The skeletal remains of Simon Allen were only discovered when deep cleaners went to his home. His body - wearing just a pair of socks - was found lying behind an armchair in the living room of the flat in Brighton, East Sussex, in November. Eleven days earlier his landlord and bailiffs had gone to the first-floor property to check why his rent had not been paid for several months. Neighbours said there had been a 'musty smell' in the hallway outside the flat before his body was found, but nothing more unusual than that. Police said they believed that Mr Allen had died in December 2010 when he would have been aged around 50. They were unable to trace any family or friends and found few personal items in the flat, which Mr Allen had rented since 1999. Paul Hanscomb, 45, who lives in a neighbouring ground floor flat, said: 'I hadn’t seen him for about two years. 'He was a heavy drinker and I used to hear him banging around in the hallway and up the stairs when he came home at night. 'But we all keep ourselves to ourselves here and we thought he’d moved out.' Chris Dunbar, who also lives in a first floor flat, added: 'It was a shock. 'I think it's quite sad really and maybe should have been investigated a bit sooner.' He said there was a slight musty smell in the hallway before Mr Allen’s body was discovered, but 'nothing strong'. The Brighton inquest heard that Mr Allen slept on two chairs pushed together and only used his bedroom for storage. Mr Allen's body was discovered behind an armchair in Leopold Road, Brighton two years after he passed away . Affinity Sutton, the housing association who owned his flat, said he was 'a model tenant'. Tracy Evans, head of housing in the south for Affinity Sutton, said: 'We were deeply saddened to hear of the death of Mr Allen. 'There was no indication that there were any problems nor that he had any additional support needs and he was a model tenant. 'Sadly, despite repeatedly trying to contact Mr Allen, the alarm was not raised until significant rent arrears had built up in 2012.' Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death and it was impossible to say how he died. Coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley said she was 'particularly saddened' that a relatively young man had not been missed. She added: 'There is no suggestion that anybody should or could have done anything different in relation to their dealings with Mr Allen. 'It seems that he chose his somewhat reclusive lifestyle.' Mr Allen was given a welfare funeral, provided for people who have no known family or friends to arrange the burial or cremation. The number of welfare funerals in Brighton has more than doubled in the last five years, from 36 in 2006/7 to 79 in 2011/12.","Simon Allen's skeleton was found behind an armchair .

"A 'miracle' drug will be provided for free to Australia's sickest cancer patients, left with no other options, through a special access program by drug manufacturer Merck Sharp and Dohme. The drug, known as MK-3475, has a positive response in about 50 per cent of patients taking it to treat advanced melanoma - compared with between 10 and 20 per cent for the current most effective treatment, Yervoy. The move comes partly due to a campaign spearheaded by Ron Walker, the former Lord Mayor of Melbourne and chairman of the Australian Grand Prix. Cancer free: Ron Walker has been campaigning for the cancer treatment drug MK-3475 to be released to metastatic melanoma sufferers . The Therapeutic Goods Administration approved a limited release of the drug last week, following pleas from patients, cancer doctors, support groups, Merck Sharp and Dohme, and Ron Walker. Each month, a small number of patients with metastatic melanoma, that has spread and is unable to be removed through surgery, will be given access to the drug. MK-3475 has been lauded as a wonder drug by doctors, shrinking tumours in over half the trial patients receiving high enough doses. The drug, which is also known as PD-1, works by blocking the cancer's ability to camouflage itself, allowing T cells to attack the cancer. Deal struck: Under a deal struck between drug manufacturer Merck Sharpe and Dohme and the Therapeutic Goods Administration, a limited number of advanced melanoma sufferers will be granted access to PD-1 treatment MK-3475 . 'Believe me, it does work,' Mr Walker told 3AW's Neil Mitchell in 2013. The prominent businessman also added that unlike a lot of cancer sufferers undergoing treatment, he was lucky enough not to have any side effects from MK-3475. Professor Grant McArthur, of Melbourne's Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, said drugs such as this one are changing the way doctors are fighting cancer. 'Overall, there are over 1,000 patients a year in Australia still passing on from the ravages of advanced melanoma, and a significant proportion of those patients moving forward would be eligible for this type of treatment,' Professor McArthur told ABC Radio on Monday morning. Last year, Ron Walker campaigned on behalf of Nick Auden, a Melbourne-born father who moved with his family to Denver, Colorado to pursue treatment for Stage 4 melanoma. Championing the cause: Ron Walker (left) has championed the cause of MK-3475, after claiming the drug saved his life . Too late: Nick Auden, pictured with son Lachy, missed out on a US clinical trial due to a medical complication that came about on the day he was set to commence treatment . After qualifying for the clinical trial of PD-1, Mr Auden was ruled out due to a medical complication. He died on November 22, 2013. 'The notable cases such as Nick, such as Ron, to be seen publically, to disclose the challenges they're going through, I think really helps the public debate about moving these treatments and getting them accessible to their patients as soon as possible,' Professor McArthur said. Despite still being in clinical trials, results have been so positive that some advanced melanoma sufferers have been granted access prior to formal regulation. Trying to walk the worries away: Nick Auden (pictured left) with his Brother Ben walking around St. Mary's Glacier, while living in Colorado to attempt to get into the PD-1 treatment trial . Ron Walker was able to use his connections, such as Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Health Minister Peter Dutton, to assist doctors in pushing forward with a limited release. Under the deal struck by Merck Sharpe and Dohme and the Therapeutic Goods Administation, a limited number of Australian patients will be granted access to the drug - prior to complete regulatory approval. Metastatic melanoma patients are being advised to speak with their oncologists regarding the treatment.","Doctors claim cancer fighting drug MK-3475 is a 'wonder drug'

"Amir Khan may not know the name of his next opponent, but he intends to look good whoever he meets in the ring. The Bolton welterweight plans to fight in May after missing out on facing either Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao, who look set to finally tackle each other in a £200million Las Vegas mega-fight.

'We looked at a few different designs for my next fight,' he told Sportsmail. 'I like to wear kit that will make me feel good when I go into a fight, that way I fight better. I want to look slick. 'I like the gold colour; they showed me different leathers, python leather and a few different colours. It depends where the fight is going to be.

The designer (right) points out a colour she is in favour of, with Khan picking an alternative one . Khan also took time out to speak to the media in Sheffield on Thursday . 'It's very important because people talk about how good you look. It makes you fight better and feel good when you're in the ring. One thing about my team, even with the tracksuits, is that we look very organised with the same kit each day.

"TV watchdogs are under pressure to launch an inquiry into the rip-off cost of watching live Premier League football on television, which can be more than £600 a year. The pay TV and broadband company Virgin Media claims the way the Premier League sells the rights to top flight matches means armchair fans in the UK are hit with unfair fees. The net result is that clubs like Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City are sharing in billions of pounds from fans whose passion and loyalty is being abused. TV watchdogs are under pressure to launch an inquiry into the rip-off cost of watching live Premier League football on television, which can be more than £600 a year . Virgin claims that viewers in the UK are getting a raw deal both on the cost of watching matches and the fact that many games are not broadcast live. It calculates that the minimum monthly cost of watching live Premier League games on the sports channels of Sky and BT comes in at £51. That works out at £612 a year, which is more than four times higher than the BBC licence fee of £145.50, which covers all of its many TV and radio channels, including Match of the Day. The £51 figure is much higher than the £21 month charge football fans in Germany must pay to see top flight teams such as the Bayern Munich and Dortmund in the Bundesliga. It is also more than double the £25 charged in Italy to watch Serie A, and compares to £18 in Spain to follow Barcelona and Real Madrid and just £10 a month in France. Access to games in the UK is also far more limited compared to the rest of Europe. Here only 41per cent of Premier League games – 154 out of 380 – are broadcast live in a season. By contrast all games are broadcast live on TV in Spain, Germany, France and Italy. Research commissioned by Virgin found more than 15per cent of viewers say they could not watch the games they wanted through their TV provider, while 25per cent found that games were not included in their pay TV subscription. Arsenals Aaron Ramsey controls the ball during a English Premiere League match against Tottenham Hotspur; Virgin Media claims the way Premier League sells the rights to top flight matches means armchair fans in the UK are hit with unfair fees . Virgin argues that the way the Premier League packages and sells the TV rights to football in this country works to artificially inflate the price. As a result, the cost of Premier League domestic live TV rights increased by 70per cent to a staggering £3 billion over three years in the last auction. It is predicted to rise by a further 60per cent when they are sold next time. The high prices charged by the Premier League means teams in the top flight are able pay world stars like Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Yaya Toure well over £200,000 a week. It also means there is absolutely no chance of live Premier League games ever returning to free-to-air terrestrial TV channels like the BBC and ITV ever again. While the sports channel subscriptions are extortionate enough in themselves, BT has been accused of putting up many other charges for all its customers in order to cover the millions of pounds it has paid to the Premier League. Virgin Media has asked Ofcom to open a formal investigation under the Competition Act 1998 into the arrangements by which the FA Premier League sells live UK television rights to its games. It claims the current regime causes ‘significant consumer harm’ resulting from escalating rights costs. The firm’s chief corporate affairs officer, Brigitte Trafford, said: ‘The rapidly rising cost of Premier League live broadcast rights means UK fans pay the highest prices in Europe to watch football on TV. Virgin Media has asked Ofcom to investigate how the rights are sold ahead of the next auction.’ The Premier League insisted the auction process it uses is entirely legal. A spokesman said: ‘Live Premier League audio-visual rights have always been sold in a transparent and open process. ‘Regulators have examined our rights packaging and sales process in considerable detail in the past and found both of them to be compliant with UK and European competition law. ‘If Ofcom chooses to investigate this complaint, we will of course be happy to demonstrate to Ofcom that this is the case.’","The minimum monthly cost of watching live Premier League is £51 .

"Amir Khan is prepared to take on middleweight world champion Miguel Cotto after missing out on a clash with both Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao.

Khan is prepared to take on middleweight world champion Miguel Cotto (right) Cotto was expected to defend his WBC title against Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez but no agreement could be reached, and Khan is ready to fight at the Puerto Rican at a catchweight. 'I was speaking to Pacquiao's team and Mayweather's team but now they're fighting each other that kills two names off for me,' he said. 'We've put a call into Timothy Bradley, Juan Manuel Marquez and Miguel Cotto. I think they're big fights for me. 'It's a waiting game at the moment. I'll fight whoever they put in front of me, I've never said no to an opponent. 'I walk around at 160lb and he [Cotto] has the title at 160lb but we know he's not a big 160lb fighter. He got stopped by Pacquiao and Mayweather beat him convincingly so a good boxer would beat him. If we can get him down to 155lb I'd take it in a heartbeat.' Khan missed out on fighting Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, who will instead fight each other . Cotto (left) fought Mayweather himself in May 2012 for the super welterweight title, the Puerto Rican lost . Khan, who expressed a preference to fighting in New York, also insisted a domestic blockbuster with Kell Brook can happen within the next two years. 'With him fighting in March and me fighting early May, the turnaround time for him will be impossible but maybe in the future,' he added. 'I never want to leave out any names, I want to fight the top names. 'The Kell Brook fight will always be there because the fans want to see it, it's a good domestic fight. I've a few years left in my career now and I want to maximise my name in America. 'Kell just won his world title so it would be good to let him defend it a few times then take it off him next year.'

"Manny Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach has started work on a game plan for the Filipino star's proposed £200million mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr. Although no official confirmation has been forthcoming, Pacquiao is expected to face Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2. And Roach has revealed he has identified sparring partners that can mimic the pound-for-pound No 1's unique style. Freddie Roach, who trains Manny Pacquiao, poses with boxers Glen Tapia and Zou Shiming . Pacquiao (left talking to Floyd Mayweather last month) is confident he will fight his rival on May 2 . 'I honestly feel the fight is going to happen,' he told SecondsOut. 'Floyd has talked on TV twice at the basketball game, which is very unusual. 'Bob Arum wants the fight, I want the fight and Manny wants the fight; a lot of good names want this fight and usually when these high people want it, they get it. 'I've done some research on Floyd and on sparring partners. This is going to be the biggest challenge ever but I think my guy can pull it off but it wont be easy. 'It's a very tactical fight and I have to come up with a great game plan.' Pacquiao also posted a message on Instagram which confirmed he is in training for his next fight and teased his fans it will be against Mayweather.

Zhuravsky, now a member of the Economic Development Party, authored a controversial bill in January severely tightening restrictions on anti-government protesters. In the past, he authored a bill criminalising libel. It came as . Ukrainian MPs pledged to ratify a key pact with the EU and voted in favour of a plan to offer the . separatist eastern part of the country limited self rule.

The . pact would remove trade barriers and mean Ukraine would adopt EU . standards in the areas of human rights, security and arms control. Russia has previously opposed the free trade parts of the pact claiming its market could be flooded with cheap EU goods shipped via Ukraine. In response Kiev agreed to delay . implementing that part of the pact until 2016 although they will be able . to freely export goods to the EU. President Petro Poroshenko called the vote a 'first but very decisive step' toward bringing Ukraine fully into the European Union. He said: 'No nation has ever paid such a high price to become Europeans,' referring to the bloody conflict that has gripped Ukraine since his predecessor, Viktor Yanukovich, walked away from the EU pact last November in favour of closer ties with Ukraine's former Soviet master, Russia. Risk: Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko is to offer limited self-rule for pro-Russian regions in the east of the country in a bid to end five months of conflict . It follows five months of bitter conflict which has left over 3,000 people dead. As . part of a peace plan signed with pro-Russian insurgents on September 5, . the Lugansk and Donetsk regions which are currently in rebel hands, . would be granted 'special status' for three years. The . draft proposals, details of which were leaked on Monday to local media, . would allow the disputed region to 'strengthen and deepen' relations . with neighboring Russian regions. The rebels . would be permitted to set up their own police forces, hold their own . local elections in November and use the Russian language in state . institutions. Fighters . on both sides would be granted freedom from prosecution, although . Poroshenko insisted there would be no amnesty for those guilty of the . most serious crimes. Commenting . on his website Poroshenko said the proposals would pave the way for . decentralisation while guaranteeing 'the sovereignty, territorial . integrity and independence of our state'. He . said: 'Over this period [three years] we will be able to implement deep . decentralization which should require amendments to the constitution.'

The . bill permits the regions to 'strengthen good neighbourly relations' with Russia and promises to help restore damaged infrastructure and to . provide social an economic assistance to particularly hard-hit areas. Rebel leader Andrei Purgin told Reuters in the separatist-held city of Donetsk: 'The basic part of the document which forsees us politically staying on Ukrainian territory - that is, naturally, not acceptable.' 'We will insist that any political unions with Ukraine are not possible now in principle,' Purgin said, renewing charges against the Ukrainian military of violating the Sept. 5 truce. No breakdown of the parliamentary vote was given after the closed-door session. The . cease-fire declared on September 5 had appeared to be holding up, but . fighting broke out again over the weekend resulting in six deaths and a . team of international monitors being shelled. The . fighting has reportedly continued throughout Monday and was particularly fierce around the airport and . railway station in the industrial city of Donetsk which is currently in . government hands. Government forces are said to have suffered heavy casualties which Kiev claims are a result of Russian troops fighting for the rebels. On the move: Ukrainian servicemen ride on an armored vehicle near the city of Kramatorsk yesterday . Russian President Vladimir Putin has justified his support for the rebels by claiming Poroshenko has failed to address the grievances of the pro-Russian regions.

While there has been been no formal reaction from separatist leaders as yet, the Russian news agency RIA Novosti quoted one leader, Andrei Purgin,  saying: 'This is a draft law for Ukraine. Perhaps this will be a point of discussion at future negotiations but no more than that.' Shelling killed six people and wounded 15 others in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, the city council said yesterday . Fighting around the eastern city's government-held airport has left its northern neighborhoods in the crossfire.

Two . northern neighborhoods were shelled heavily Sunday, leading to the . casualties and damaging both homes and offices, the city council said. Loud . blasts could be heard from the direction of the airport all day Monday, . and gunfire intermittently rang out downtown in the afternoon. 'Neither today, nor yesterday, nor in the previous days did Ukrainian forces shell any residential areas,' said Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council. Both the rebel and government sides have said they are rearming in case the fighting starts anew. In an interview yesterday, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that 'around 1,000' Russian soldiers remain in Ukraine. 'While the Russians may have withdrawn some of their troops in Ukraine, there is a still Russian military presence within Ukraine,' Rasmussen said in Brussels, adding that several thousand Russian soldiers were also along the border with Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a phone conversation on Monday both stressed the importance of observing the cease-fire, the Kremlin said in a statement. The Kremlin did not mention the frequent violations. Merkel said she had told Putin that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine for the peace plan to work. She said the complete withdrawal must accompany a securing of the Russian-Ukrainian border to prevent fighters and arms from flowing to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.","Controversial MP Vitaly Zhuravsky seized outside parliament in Kiev .

"German car giant Volkswagen is to recall tens of thousands of cars in the UK – including those carrying Audi, Skoda and SEAT badges - because of problems with faulty gearboxes which cause a loss of power while driving. Thousands more are being recalled because of fuse problems which cause lights to cut out. It is part of a worldwide recall of more than 2.6million cars because of a variety of technical problems. Some 30,000 of the cars being recalled in Britain, including the popular Golf model, are fitted with a 7-speed gearbox. Some 30,000 of the cars being recalled in Britain, including the popular Golf model, are fitted with a 7-speed gearbox (file picture) Some 1.6m cars and vans are to be recalled globally over problems with a gearbox which leads to a loss of power. VW says it will replace the hi-tech synthetic oil used in 7-speed dual-clutch gearboxes with traditional mineral oil (file picture) It also affects cars from the wider ‘Volkswagen Group’ – including those badged as Audis, Skoda, and SEAT – which also have the same gearbox. Some 1.6million cars and vans are to be recalled globally over problems with a gearbox which leads to a loss of power. Volkswagen says it will replace the hi-tech synthetic oil used in seven-speed dual-clutch gearboxes with traditional mineral oil. This follows evidence that gearboxes in hot and humid areas such as in China and South-East Asia are susceptible to electrical faults in stop-start traffic. As a result, Volkswagen issued a global voluntary recall for all cars fitted with the seven-speed drives. In addition, 30,000 VW Tiguans are being recalled in the UK because of a problem with fuses which cause headlights to cut out (file picture) Drivers in Australia have campaigned vociferously for some months over the problem after motorists lost power. Volkswagen said it was not aware of cases of drivers losing power in Britain. The company said it was seeking exact details of models affected. In addition, 30,000 Volkswagen Tiguans are being recalled in the UK because of a problem with fuses which cause headlights to cut out. Globally, the recall includes 800,000 Volkswagen Tiguans built between 2008 and 2011. The company said an electrical fuse failure may cause lighting failures on several different circuits. Around 250,000 pick-ups are also being recalled for repairs to the fuel system to prevent leaks. The recall is one of the biggest in VW's history. On the gearbox fault, a  Volkswagen spokesman at the car giant’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Northern Germany said: 'It has been discovered that, with vehicles with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox (DQ200), electric malfunctions could occur in the gearbox power supply if synthetic gearbox oil is used. ‘This applies in particular if the vehicle is subject to a hot and humid climate, coupled with a high proportion of stop and go driving.’ He added: ‘Studies have established that using mineral oil will rectify this problem. 'To continue to ensure customer satisfaction among DSG [dual-clutch gearboxes], Volkswagen has decided to launch global voluntary campaign and to request all customers with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox (DQ200) filled with synthetic oil to visit a workshop for an oil exchange. 'The vehicle owners will be informed by Volkswagen accordingly.’ Globally, the recall includes 800,000 Volkswagen Tiguans (interior, above) built between 2008 and 2011 . Some 640,000 of the cars are being recalled in China, where Volkswagen produces cars for the local market, as well as selling imports. China is now the biggest car market in the world, an important source of demand for global carmakers looking for growth to offset declines in European car sales. Volkswagen says it wants to double its manufacturing capacity in China to 4million cars a year by 2018, helping it to become the biggest car company in the world by sales. However, the size of Volkswagen’s global recall is dwarfed by Toyota's recall of 10million cars in 2009 and 2010, amid accident fears over sticky accelerator pedals and floor mats. Chas Hallett, editor in chief of consumer magazine What Car? said: ‘This is a big recall for sheer volumes of cars. ‘But recalls happen all the time in the car industry and they're always done for safety or reliability issues.' Mr Hallett added: 'In the end, it won't harm Volkswagen and if you're an owner of one of the cars, as long as you get the work done as soon as possible, there's nothing to worry about.’","Some 1.6m cars and vans to be recalled worldwide over problems with a gearbox which leads to loss of power .

"Russia was accused of sending tanks into Ukraine for the first time yesterday while the West’s attention was diverted by the chaos in Iraq. The development threatens to destroy the tentative peace process just when the US and EU had hoped Vladimir Putin had agreed to ease tension.

Russia has repeatedly claimed it would not invade eastern Ukraine, even though it annexed the Crimean peninsula in March. Two . of the three tanks moved towards Horlivka – a mining city in Donetsk . region twinned with Barnsley – and one remained in Snizhne. Ukrainian forces attacked the convoy, claimed Kiev interior minister Arsen Avakov. ‘Over . the last three days, despite Russia’s statements welcoming the peace . process, a column has been sneaking into the area of Dyakove through . checkpoints seized by terrorists,’ he said. ‘We have registered the passage of a  column including APCs, armoured vehicles with cannons. ‘Today we see three tanks which, according to our information, crossed the border and were in Snizhne.’ Mr Avakov claimed there was a ‘fight’ going on with the column – which was not believed to be displaying Russian colours. ‘Part of this column has been destroyed,’ he said.
